Michael Keaton and Kelly Preston are great and so  is the boy in the film!",945993600,4,247,4.326086956521739
1243468,5,B00001IVEC,"I loved this movie, and, it touched my heart also. I think the scenery was beautiful and it just makes you want to get cozy and sit in  a big comfy chair in the middle of a snowstorm and watch it! I also thought Michael  Keaton looked pretty good! That was a plus!",945734400,6,264,3.9622641509433962
1243469,1,B00001IVEC,"This has to be one if not one of the worst movie that I have ever seen!  I can not beliveve that you people like this.  This is not for kids,  it makes them turn in to brats!  I can not stand this!  I could not handle it!  The snowman was scary!  He creep me out!  I would compare this movie to  HOWARD THE DUCK!  But HTD was some what funny!",944697600,4,342,3.6901408450704225
1243470,4,B00001IVEC,"What's good about ""Jack Frost"" is that it can appeal to both children and adults (if you are a kid at heart!) :0)
I found it quite fascinating to watch the snowman come to life, the special effects were  kool.  I enjoyed seeing the snowman bop around, frollicking with his son  and at the same time bringing joy to the child's heart.
The scene that  made me cry was when the boy was making the snowman and the song  ""Landslide"" by Fleetwood Mac was playing in the background.  This  movie is warm and touching, and is also a great holiday movie.",943920000,3,545,4.336633663366337
1243471,5,B00001IVEC,"""Jack Frost"" is truly a classical family movie for our time. It's the sotry about a Dad (Michael Keaton) who gets killed in a car accident. One year later, his spirit returns in the form of a lovable  snowman. While during his lifetime, he was always busy, and just didn't  make time to be with his son, now as the snowman he makes a final attempt  to let his son know that he really loved him, and that he'll be always with  him in his heart. It's good to see that Hollywood can still produce movies  that touch the heart and that are enjoyable entertainment for the whole  family. Don't forget to keep a box of Kleenex near by.",943488000,31,629,4.243697478991597
1243472,5,B00001IVEC,"This was a fun, whimsical family movie!  I took my whole family to see it when it was released and we all throughly enjoyed it.

1243539,5,B00001IVEC,"Took a gamble on Jack Frost (1998: Michael Keaton et al) being a meaningless kiddie flick. Surprising satisfying and touching, a family film with a touch of magic and lots of humor. It also dared have one teen say that life without a dad sucked - political correctivism now demands we rubbish fatherhood in spite of the true sociology, and family life (thus marriage) in general. I guess in 1998 PCism wasn't so dominant. The dad, Jack Frost, combined his love of music with his love of family, trying to do the right thing amid some conflict of loves. Ironically he died by making the right choice, but (presumably) by the grace & humor of heaven next winter found himself in a snowman's body on his family's front lawn. Initially he only revealed himself to his son (Charlie) and sought to spend quality parent time with him to make up for lost time, even to the extent of risking his meltable body. As things warm up, he follows Charlie's scheme to keep his far from abominable snowman life going forever. As crunch time comes, Jack, believing that only his body will melt, realizes that it's time to leave his widow (Gabby) and son to their mortal lives. Only at this end does Gabby meet Jack postmortem, and comes out with ""my god"" or ""o God"". Jack could have smilingly pointed upwards at this stage, since the film, being pro-marriage, pro-family, pro-fathers, pro-postmortem, could easily have gone just a little deeper into what C S Lewis called the Deeper Magic. A good family film of fun & frolic.",1514764800,,1507,4.647940074906367

1243542,4,B00001IVEC,"This is a movie that grew up watching on VHS, and now own it on DVD, and it's always been a favorite to watch around Christmas. Michael Keaton plays Jack Frost, an up-coming musician playing in a local band. He loves playing and wants to make a living out of it for his wife,played by Kelly Preston, and his son, Charlie, played by Joseph Cross. He is very close to his first big break but, unfortunately, he is missing quality time with his family. Than, one night, while driving home in the snow for Christmas, Jack crashes his car and is killed. One year later, Jack returns in the form of a walking, talking snowman. A very heartwarming and fun family film that I highly recommend.",1513728000,,685,4.444444444444445

A very Cliche movie with the Cliche dad who's not there for his kid, ends up dying and coming back as a Snowman.

1243670,5,B00001IVEC,"My comments are not really needed on a crowded field with many other reviews, but I liked ""Jack Frost"" very much.  The interaction between Michael Keaton and Kelly Preston is excellent in the early scenes and adds a lot to the interest of the story line.  Joseph Cross, 12 years old in 1998 when ""Jack Frost"" was made, is excellent as their pre teenage son trying to find himself with a great love of hockey and winter sports.  Special animation is tastefully used to support the story line.
The return of Michael Keaton's character as a snowman is humorous and to some, creepy and should be explained as pure fantasy to young children: perhaps that the boy had a dream about his (recently deceased) father.

Music is also well used to keep interest, not unlike John Williams score in ""Home Alone"" (1990), although the music is not by Williams.

I found ""Jack Frost"" funny and sad in turns, especially sad in the final scene where Frost says goodbye to his son and wife.",1484611200,,970,4.583815028901734

1244118,3,B00001IVEC,"There is a reason why this is $5. It's cheesy. It's basically the story of Frosty the Snowman. A neglectful, but fun husband and father dies regretting that he didn't give his family more of himself. Before he goes, he gives his son a harmonica saying something like, ""If you need me, just blow into this and I will be there."" A year later, the son does and the father comes back as a snowman at Christmas. A warm day comes threatening ""dad's"" life. ... you can guess the rest.

It has a very 90s feel and will probably never become a family favorite or classic. Still, if you are spending the day in the Christmas spirit and have already watched all the real favorites, it's not horrible. There is no foul language, sex, nudity, or blood so the whole family can watch it. (I think they say ""Damn"" a few times).",1448755200,,811,4.3355263157894735

He enlists the help of Father Winter, Snip the snow flake maker and a snow fairy to help him.  This is fun and very sweet.  Buddy Hackett is just a fabulous narrator.  What an amazing voice.  It is very different from any of the other Christmas specials you will see.  It even explains why the Ground hog sees his shadow.  There are no toys delivered, just a very sweet story and even a fun, silly villain.",1425859200,,628,4.2100840336134455

It's an excellent family movie with Michael Keaton as a musician who dies in a car accident and comes back to life for his son as a snowman they built.

A definite Christmas classic and if you haven't sat down to watch it before, next Christmas switch up the movie catalog a bit and throw this one on, you won't be disappointed.",1420329600,,446,4.258823529411765

1244773,1,B00001IVEC,"It doesn't amaze me to see all the positive reviews, as the true meaning of Christmas has been buried by commercialism and fantasy movies.

1244777,1,B00001IVEC,"Unfortunately I didn't see the 20% rating from Rotten Tomatoes and the 5.2/10 stars from IMBD before I watched the movie. Based on the 4.5 stars on Amazon I thought that this movie would be great. Actually, it started out pretty decently with a snow battle almost comparable to upbeat, really great movies like ""The Sandlot."" Next thing I know, the kids dad died in a car accident. However, that's not what made it a bad movie. Plenty of great movies feature heroes that have lost a parent. This movie, on the other hand, never recovered from the shock of the father's sudden death. It flashes forward to a year later where the kid is still depressed, facing another Christmas alone. His life stinks and he is depressed. Suddenly, he builds a snowman that magically turns into his dad. Or rather, his dead father is reincarnated as the snowman. While the idea of the kid reuniting with his deceased father and rebuilding his self confidence seems heart-warming on the surface, there is something about the emotional bond between the snowman and the kid that I just couldn't get over. It was frankly creepy and almost disturbing. After watching the movie I felt very uncomfortable for the rest of the night as I tried to find some redeeming value in the movie. This is not a movie that will bring holiday cheer, this is not a movie that will help someone deal with loss of a loved one, and this is not a movie that kids or parents would likely enjoy. I really can't recommend this movie to anyone. Do not watch this movie. If you want to watch a great Christmas movie that's free with Amazon Prime, I recommend ""Arthur's Perfect Christmas.""",1418947200,6,1639,4.616438356164384
1244778,4,B00001IVEC,A fun and sweet show.  I had never heard of this before but had to say I really enjoyed it.  The show itself was typical but the cast made it where you would watch it again.  Is it a classic  NO but still a fun show to share with your family,1418947200,,241,3.6666666666666665

Lots of other Christmas/winter movies that are much cuter than this one.  Once is enough for me.  Perhaps if they had made the snowman a bit better looking?  Ending is touching, though, when the father is seen as himself and he then gets to talk with his wife and son, and all say goodbye.  And after that, I think the father's best friend becomes the mother's boyfriend???  Not sure about that, but it kind of looks that way.",1418688000,,562,4.346153846153846

I am a college student, but the ending of the movie had tears in my eyes!  One of the best Christmas movies I have seen in a long time.  Plus, come on, Michael Keaton...as a snow man.

1245192,5,B00001IVEC,"What can you say about this awesome holiday/winter movie. Its about a boy's love for his Dad, and vice versa. Do not want to ruin it for those who have never seen so I'll just say, Michael Keaton gives his usual superb performance and the son will warm/break your heart for how much he adores his father.  This movie is a must-have for any father or son. Especially if the parents are divorced, in my opinion, because it is just so heartwarming and will remind little boys that their Dads love them and would do ANYTHING to be with them!  Great delivery time as usual, and my nephew (one of my gifts to him) has never seen this one, so I was very happy about that also.  Oh, did I mention it is currently on sale for $3.75!!!? I think all divorced Dads should make this a stocking stuffer and then watch it with their boys (or girls). Its tough on kids when people divorce, a little reminder during the holidays, that the parent that does not have custody adores his/her children is a nice thing.

1245263,1,B00001IVEC,"Michael Keaton dies in a car accident and his soul is inexplicably sent into the body of a snowman. The changing of the seasons is presumed to mark the death knell of this newly reanimated Keaton, but there are cold enough places that he probably could have lived within indefinitely. A walk-in freezer, or a mountain top hideaway. But no, this movie is about Keaton having to apologize to his son for being good at his job, and apparently not loving his family enough. It's not clear whether or not any of this is true, but he must make amends within an artificial timeframe. Keaton attempts to accomplish this through various awkward snowman hijinks that will probably entertain children but will either bore parents or send their thoughts into bleak existential worry about, for instance, what it means when he begins to melt. Are those his innards? Does it hurt? Why am I thinking so hard about this dumb movie? Frosty the Snowman is a better version of a possessed snowperson and utterly lacks this straw man debate about being a better parent. Plus Frosty dies a horrible death in a greenhouse at one point. Note that Jack Frost was originally going to star George Clooney but he backed out at the last minute. This is why the puppet has the ""Clooney"" eyebrows. The horror movie version of Jack Frost, which came out around the same time (possibly tricking some families into renting the wrong film?) was more fun because those who made it at least acknowledged what a terrible concept it was that they were putting to film. As it stands this family-friendly version is only slightly less horrifying. A disturbing film. One star.",1417132800,6,1635,4.7403508771929825

1245440,3,B00001IVEC,"...though Christmas sits in the background for just about the entire film.  It's more about a man named Jack Frost, played by Michael Keaton, dying and coming back to life as a snowman to make up for his past mistakes.  Like in some other movies, I found the explanation for this phenomenon to be lackluster at best.  Come on, the harmonica happens to be magic after Jack Frost had said as much while meaning it as a joke?  Pretty weak.  But I suppose it can work for younger kids.  Problem is, I doubt kids young enough to accept this will not be age-appropriate for this film, what with the death, bullies, grief, etc.  But despite the reasons, Keaton brought a fair amount of life to the snowman, making more than just a snowy creation.  Unfortunately, Keaton's was by far the best performance here with Joseph Cross taking a somewhat distance second.  Too many cast members seemed to just be going through the motions of making the movie rather than actually acting.  Also, some character's changes of heart were sudden and jarring and therefore just didn't make sense.  But ultimately, it's a kids' film, so kids might get more out of it than me.  Just don't let them believe that this is a holiday film of any kind as that's a serious stretch of the imagination.  Enjoy.",1404086400,,1276,4.592920353982301

1245457,5,B00001IVEC,"I recently purchased this movie after months of tedious searching for the perfect movie for five 27 year old men to watch during a ""Man Weekend.""  I ultimately decided on this film due to the numerous puns of snow in the description.  After watching the film with four of my closest friends, I have to admit that I was not disappointed.  It had many of our favorite movie aspects like high production value, a fantastic score, and Michael Keaton, but more importantly, we all were able to relate to this movie on a personal level.

Every one of us lost someone dear to us, and they re-animated themselves in everyday objects that are usually inanimate.  When Jack Frost came back as a snowman, we were all sobbing with joy and confusion.  Michael Keaton has a flawless performance as the snowman, and caused all of us to become somewhat aroused.  The movie could have done without Kelly Preston, and Robert Baratheon; however, could NOT have done without Kelly Preston's boobs.

Overall, I give this movie 5 stars for the fact that it was near perfection.  This movie was so immaculate that we watched it 12 more times in the span of 48 hours.  By the end, we were laughing, drunk, and quoting key parts of the movies.  Truly, Snowdad is better than No Dad.",1395619200,,1257,4.591928251121076

1245480,5,B00001IVEC,"A master class in filmmaking. The crown-jewel of the late-90s dead-father-as-snow-men genre.

This movie transports you a wondrous place - a place where internal logic and the motivational coherence of its characters mere vestiges - trappings of your sad, normative in movie-going.

Jack Frost is the real deal. ART, man.

Some Questions: If you came back from the dead as a snowman, would you hide your ghastly, horrific visage from the public?
Or would you simply wander round town; an albatross to both your son's psychological well-being and social life?
Would you try and get in touch with your widow, to console, to care, to perhaps reconcile for your absence?
Or would you spend virtually all of your post-mortem, almost-definitely limited time on teaching your unappreciative kid a cool hockey trick?
After re-materializing and opening up several existential quandaries as this icy golem: do you stay with your still-traumatized family to help nurse the wounds of your untimely demise, or attempt in any way to make up for lost time?
Or do you completely & arbitrarily exit AGAIN from their lives - this time with seemingly no impetus - leaving only a series of incoherent behavioral questions in your wake?
Would you explain to anyone where or what you've been for a year, to assuage humanity's spectral terror of death and what-lies-after?
DO YOU ADDRESS UN-BEING AND NOTHINGNESS?

No. You are Jack Frost. You Da Man. You Da SNOWman.",1390176000,9,1443,5.02510460251046

Okay, wish granted, the lesson is seen coming, but it is still a good lesson and it always gets me every-time I watch it.

The parts of this movie that I love are the snowball fights (aka snowball wars) and also sledge chases.  I mean, those scenes are just amazing and fun to watch.  They are what children and teenagers love to see.

1245494,3,B00001IVEC,This is not the original Michael Keaton movie. This movie is just an animated Jack Frost. Michael Keaton was not in this movie version. Kind of boring. Even my grandkids did not enjoy this animated movie.,1388966400,,204,4.694444444444445

1245503,5,B00001IVEC,Michael Keaton is a very good actor & I was very surprised to hear him sing too. He did a very good job on bringing Jack Frost in a snowman form to life. And that the snowman looks just like Michael Keaton when he brought Jack Frost as a human to life. It's just like how Jackie Vernon did the voice & singing voice of Frosty The Snowman from a long time ago.,1388102400,,359,3.9315068493150687
1245504,4,B00001IVEC,My family loves watching this movie during the holidays. It takes you on an emotional journey that really has you invested in the charaters. The movie ends on a high note and makes you want to watch it again.,1388102400,,208,4.358974358974359

1245510,5,B00001IVEC,I watch this movie every year.  It is one of my favorites.  Having your Dad die when you are so young is hard but this movie puts it in perspective.  Death is not the end but a new beginning and none of us are getting out alive.  I loved the ending with all the love and kindness.  We all need to see and feel this movie.,1387584000,,321,3.803030303030303

1245512,5,B00001IVEC,"Jack Frost (1979) is yet another Rankin Bass gem, though not nearly as popular as their other holiday specials, (such as Rudolph or Santa Claus is Comin' to Town), but is still entertaining. Perhaps its lesser popularity has to do with the story focusing on Groundhog Day, though winter itself and Christmas are loosely intertwined into the story. Do not let this discourage you; this story is very entertaining, and the animation is in top form as usual. For the narration, Buddy Hackett gets the call for this one, and he does a wonderful job. The music is very good, too; there are a lot of catchy songs that will have you humming. This story is filled with romance, courage, and sacrifice. It's impressive that this special is an hour long, which is a testament to the story's depth. Jack Frost is recommended holiday viewing for the kids and family.",1387238400,,854,4.7

The last time I saw him, I was 8 years old & it was Christmas Eve. I've watched this movie every year around Christmas time since I can remember! Not just because it's a good flick, but because I can relate!

(Some of the jokes were hilarious).  The special effects were ""kool"".  The snowman was kind looking and cute and Michael Keaten did a gr8 job bringing him to life.  The scenery was fantastic, I love mountains and snow, so it's a great escape to look at if you live in so. cal near the beach.  My fave scene is where the kid is building the snowman and ""Landslide"" by Stevie Nicks is playing in the background.  It makes me cry every time I see that part.

The movie is kind dark in a way some people think it a bootleg but, the movie was film that way doesn't bother me much.

1245619,4,B00001IVEC,This animated TV special is actually about Jack Frost and not Christmas.  The holiday featured is Groundhog's Day but it has a wintery feel that can best be appreciated at Christmas time.  Robert Morse and Paul Frees led their voices to one of the better Rankin-Bass productions and Romeo Muller's songs are catchy.  This tale of love-lost and being responsible is quite entertaining.,1355875200,,384,5.063492063492063

1245636,5,B00001IVEC,"I listed this as a ""wintertime"" story because it is not necessarily just about Christmas but about the magic of love.  Michael Keaton once again does a fantastic job as a reincarnated Snowman who helps his son adjust to his untimely death on Christmas eve.  Fantastic story with a great cast.  Heartwarming and touching.  Don't miss putting this in your Christmas movie collection.  It is a ""must watch"" for us every year.",1353974400,,422,4.805555555555555

1245648,5,B00001IVEC,This may not be a Christmas movie per say but I consider it to be a good Christmas movie if for no other reason that it takes place at Christmas. Actually it takes place at two of them but nevermind. Its also a funny movie not to mention a touching one. After all a wife loses her husband in an accident and so does her son. He is reincarnated as a snowman a year later. Anything else I could say might be a spoiler so Ill stop there other than to say you should get it.,1338940800,,470,3.90625

1245659,2,B00001IVEC,"Ok, I love bad horror movies, but this is a horror in a different light. Michael Keaten in a movie that destroyed his career: stars as a man who dies and comes back as a snowman. HE doesn't melt even , it's just a bizaare movie. Actually I find santa claus to be a real horror pertetrated on children and this is even worse than a fat man who teaches kids that they deserve free gifts while usurping the true meaning of christmas.  Still the effects were fine for the 90's. Which was the audience this was intended for , but it was a disaster. As A lover of bad b movies I can't even recommend this one.  I like the other 'jack frost' better, in which a animated snowman hunts down people. Or the other version in which the lead character is a serial killer.  Oh yeah, those are bad but they are better than this one.",1324425600,,817,4.158227848101266

1245661,5,B00001IVEC,"i recently viewed this dvd along with my significant other. I can say that it is very delightful. I have not yet seen the ending due to falling asleep. I have read, though, from other amazon.com comments that it is sad. My significant other also mentioned this as well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has the Christmas Spirit within. It is a joyous movie. Also, family men will be able to relate to Keaton's character before he is turned into a snowman. I guess afterwards too. But it was heart-warming to see him with his son and his wife just having fun throwing snow around and laughing. So all in all, a very good movie. If you're one for holiday movies. Than pick this one up. It's the holidays right now as it is. What are you doing reading this review?? Get going and purchase this wonderful holiday movie.

A struggling musician father, Jack Frost, (Michael Keaton) never seems to have enough time for his son and lets him down a lot. Christmas eve night he has an accident. His wife Gabby (Kelly Preston) and his son Charlie (Joseph Cross) struggle with putting the pieces back together. One year later, Jack returns to his son in the form of a snowman and decides it's time to really be there for his son. Even though it has kind of a Christmas theme I think it's a great movie to watch any time of year. Michael Keaton, Kelly Preston, and Joseph Cross give a heart-warming performance.

1245685,5,B00001IVEC,"I just got this DVD and it is another class by Rankin/Bass. Their animation is the best! If you're like me, you may have seen this on TV before so why buy it? Well trust me this remastered edition is so much prettier than when it comes on TV. I was really impressed with how great it looked. It also has an extra song on it that Kubla Kraus sings, that they don't show on TV. As for the special features, I really liked the sing alongs, but the host for the craft feature named ""Flakey"" she scared me a bit... I used to watch this with my brother every year, before he moved out so it brings back good memories for me. The story is great, it's neat to see Jack Frost try to fit in as a human name Jack Snip. Most Christmas shows don't go past Christmas but this one goes all the way till the start of spring which I think made it special. I also love the charater design, Elisa is so pretty and it's neat to see the charaters that make hail and sleet. My fav thing about Jack Frost is even though they didn't have much money Elisa and the people of her town didn't seem overly sad. I also think it's neat how they gave dream presents and sang ""It's just what I always wanted.""

1245706,5,B00001IVEC,"This movie is about a dad named Jack Frost (Michael Keaton) who gets so caught up in trying to impress the world that he forgets about his wife, portrayed by Kelly Preston, and most importantly, his son Charlie (Joseph Cross.) On the way to a band gig one Christmas Eve, he realizes that he has neglected his wife and his son. On the way back to their cabin, Jack gets in a car accident and is killed. Fast-forward to the next Christmas; we see that Charlie is still struggling to cope with his dad's passing. His dad had spent a lot of time trying to make lots of money for his family, which his son couldn't have cared any less about. All he wanted was his dad's time, and to feel his dad's love.

One year later, Charlie builds a snowman and starts playing the harmonica that his dad had given him and had told him was a magic harmonica. Not long after, Charlie is greeted by a walking, talking snowman. Initially, Charlie is scared of it (who has ever had a snowman talk to them), and he tries to melt the snowman. Soon, Charlie realizes that his dad, who he loves with all his heart has come back to try and make things right with him. In the end, Jack makes things right with his family, particularly his son. The few hours that Jack and Charlie spend together make up for a lot of lost time, and Charlie finally gets to feel all of his dad's love all at once. The end is awesome, and I think the Bob Carlisle song ""Father's Love"" was very appropriate. The only change I would have made is that I would play that song during the final moments that Charlie spends with his dad before he has to say good-bye.

Everyone turned in an awesome performance in this film, but Michael Keaton and Joseph Cross stole the show with their scene at the end of the movie. Those two seemed like a real father and son. Kelly Preston turned in an awesome performance as Charlie's mom. Those three seemed like a real family, and like they'd known each other their whole lives. Great movie, and God bless the cast and crew.",1242259200,,2009,4.3121693121693125

As for the review, it's not the grandest of the Rankin/Bass classic movies, but it is endearing. I love anything to do with Jack Frost. I'm a Jack Frost enthusiast, and this is a wonderful interpretation of the character. It's a heart-warming story and a great watch on a snowy day.

But, if your a little over-emotional or overly sensitive, I'd be careful. It's been said before, this movie kinda has a downside in the ending department.",1228867200,5,705,4.366412213740458
1245714,4,B00001IVEC,"This is a really good family film that takes place around Christmas. To me, it's not really a Christmas movie, but more of a family film that could be watched around Christmas time. (If that makes any sense.) A musician named Jack Frost spends too much time with his music, than with his son and smokin' hot wife. He gives his son, Charlie a harmonica that he says is magic. When Jack has to leave on Christmas Eve, his son gets mad and gives him back the harmonica. Jack changes his mind and decides to go back. While driving, he has a terrible accident and dies. A year later, we see how Charlie and his smokin' hot mom deal with the pain. It's actually quite sad to think about having no dad at Christmas time. Charlie builds a snowman just for the heck of it, and later plays his dad's harmonica. Jack comes back, but in the body of the snowman. Throughout the film, Charlie and Jack have fun and get into misadventures. Until it gets hot, Charlie tries to save his dad from the heat, but Jack knows that he only came back to temporarily for a 2nd chance. If you love comedy, Christmas, and your family, including dad, you'll love JACK FROST!!!",1227916800,6,1148,4.369158878504673
1245715,5,B00001IVEC,A feel good movie.  As the Christmas queen collector of over 700 titles I recommend this as a family night film gather the kids and grab some hot chocolate. It is a story of love and laughs and maybe a tear or two. My five kids watch this every year and they enjoy Micheal Keaton as the snow Dad to Charlie.  Micheal Keaton was always too busy to spend time with his family and then tradgedy strikes when a horrible accident happens on Christmas Eve.

I want to have a snowball fight. I wanna build a snowman! There hasn't been a decent snowfall in years, at least since I was young. Boo.

OK, the film was kinda soppy, and took a while to get going, considering it's pretty predictable that Michael Keaton's character is going to die - yes that's right kids, he dies. Ooooooh. But it's the only Christmas movie I own. And I needed something Christmassy to watch. It was a 'cool' film otherwise, although some of the effects were slightly dodgy in parts, especially the section where they're snowboarding away from the bullies.

The ending is very sad, although I think someone's definitely been watching Ghost & Starman for inspiration, as the finale was heavily borrowed from these. However, it gets the tears flowing, and is a good end to a slightly predictable movie.

JACK FROST stars Michael Keaton, who doesn't get much screen time as Keaton, but instead voices a marvelously effected snowman.  The human Jack Frost is a struggling musician who is just about to make it big, but sadly he dies in a car crash.  Although not a bad father, in his quest for notoriety, his wife and son suffered some in not having a lot of quality time together.  A year after the accident, Frost miraculously (via a ""magic"" harmonica) returns as a snowman and decides to make up to his son for his lack of attention.  From this point, we get some nifty scenes of father/snowman/son bonding, and by the time the movie reaches its unavoidable climax, if you haven't sniffled a little, you're colder than a snowman!

Keaton is very good; Kelly Preston looks lovely and delivers a solid performance as Gabby; and Joseph Cross, though limited in his abilities, nonetheless is touching as Charlie.

JACK FROST has a wonderful message that some might consider schmaltzy, but for those who have lost a loved one, it inspires you to remember that life goes on and the memories you cherish in your heart will always keep that loved one near.

1245732,3,B00001IVEC,"Don't confuse this one with the horror film about a killer snowman of the same name.  This Christmas film isn't bad but ultimately doesn't have enough magic and cheer to make it become one of those movies you want to view annually.

Jack Frost is a Blues singer who's on the road most of the time so he can't spend a lot of time with his son Charlie, although they love each other very much. When Jack dies in a car accident, Charlie becomes a very sad young man, until... Jack returns as a snowman! Now they can do all the things they've missed when Jack was human, but what will people think when they see Charlie talking to a snowman and what will happen when the weather gets warmer?

This harmless fantasy was unfairly maligned by the majority of critics upon its release, some of whom gave it no or one star in their rating. There's nothing original here in terms of the themes or ideas and it borrows from plenty of other, better movies but on its own terms.  Kelly Preston is, of course, gorgeous as the mom, but Joseph Cross as son Charlie is a little weak.

1245739,5,B00001IVEC,"Christmas time is for giving. But unfortunately for the Frost family, Dad's not coming home. After a car accident, ""Jack Frost"" (Michael Keaton) is reincarnated as a snowman! He comes back to spend some quality time with his grieving family, his wife Gabby and son Charlie (Kelly Preston and Joseph Cross). While bonding with his boy, the two join forces to battle the local bullies at school with torpedo snowballs and massive sled chases. It was pure superiority! Gabby learns how to live without her husband and becomes an independent, single mother. Jack's motives were clearly dauntless. Charlie gained confidence as well and stood up against the evil snowboarders. Jazz music has never sounded better with the talent of Michael Keaton singing. This movie is an inspiration for anybody and is a masterpiece that should be experienced every Christmas. People watch the ""Charlie Brown Christmas"" and ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,"" but they forget the true adroitness of this refined family picture. Some people may even be afraid of building snowmen after watching this movie. It's just freaky that a snowman can talk and boogy with his kid. Oh, he's the coolest dad now, get it!? ... This movie really does deliver life changing messages that should not be taken granted for. Family bonding is an important value everyone should cherish. I praise this movie. Surely, this is Michael Keaton's finest performance since ""Batman"" and Kelly Preston is an idolic figure for any single mother. Just think if you have it bad now, just see how Gabby dealt with her late husband being a snowman. So, why don't you sit down with your family and build a fire, but be sure you don't have a snowman around. No melting. Love is the key and I can't emphasize that enough.

1245740,5,B00001IVEC,"If a movie has a snowman in it, then it's a movie for me. It's hard to put into words what these rotund beings of crystalized water molecules represent, but their icy-calm joviality in the dead of winter brings a smile to my face. They symbolize life, when life is in hibernation.
(Although, the word ""snowman"" is gender-specific, and beings so pure are above such petty distinctions. I prefer calling them ""snow-sapiens."")
With the advances in CGI, I was waiting for Hollywood to bring me a lifelike tale of snowmen. My hopes were granted with the release of the magical film ""Jack Frost.""
Full of dazzling special effects, ""Jack Frost"" brings us the story of a young boy (Charlie) who's lost his father. They are reunited when Dad's spirit animates a bouncy, energetic man of snow. Michael Keaton (in his best work since ""Multiplicity"") provides the voice of this cool character. Together, Charlie and the snowman share many snow-themed adventures, from a rousing sled-ride to a snowball fight. To be sure, their opponents don't stand a chance against a being so adept at throwing projectiles formed from his own substance! Such is the power of Jack Frost.
It's poetic that a being composed of cold can bring such a magical tale of warmth. This uplifting fairy tale will be frozen in place as a classic of American cinema.
Just beware of a similarly titled movie about a serial-killing snow creature. It's a stain on the purity of snow-sapien films.",1028505600,5,1451,4.831325301204819

1245742,5,B00001IVEC,"JACK FROST is a wonderful film. It's about an aspiring musician, Jack Frost (Michael Keaton) who is struggling relationships with his loving wife, Gaby (Kelly Preston), and 12-year-old son, Charlie (Joseph Cross) because his band is keeping him from spending quality time with them. Then, on Christmas, Jack finds out that his band just got a record deal but they have to leave to go to a party so the record label can hear them play. And he had already made plans to spend Christmas with his family. He goes off, but then decides to head home again because he doesn't want to miss Christmas with his family. On the way home, however, it starts snowing really hard and he gets into a car accident and dies.
Exactly a year later, Gaby and Charlie and still struggling from the loss of Jack. Charlie goes outside his house one night and tries to make a snowman the way he made one with his father the year before. Suddenly, a few hours later, the snowman comes to life after Charlie plays the hermonica his father had given to him. Jack is given a second chance (even though he comes back to life in the form of the snowman Charlie built) to prove to Charlie and his wife that he can be a dedicated loving father and husband.
JACK FROST is a really fun and delightful family film. It's for all ages (though really young children may find the death of Jack Frost a little tense). Through all the humor, there is a tender, touching message. It's a little sad at the end, too. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb. I was surprised that Michael Keaton could sing - he does it very well, even if he was trained for it during the filming. The supporting cast also includes Andy Lawerence, who plays Charlie's best friend. The actor who really shines in this film isn't actually Michael Keaton or Kelly Preston - but it's Joseph Cross (WIDE AWAKE), who plays the son.
This film may look a little cheesy, but it really isn't. JACK FROST is a film everyone should own and treasure - it's a real, underrated gem!",996710400,4,2014,4.46070460704607

First, the pictures don't do the snowman justice  because they really did a good job in the movie making the snow man look  good with the use of teaming up with George Lucas Industrial Light and  Magic.  Awesome!

1245749,5,B00001IVEC,"Jack Frost is a delightful, touching, and magical Christmas movie for the family. It begins with a father named Jack Frost (played by the wonderful Michael Keaton). Though he has very good intentions and so much love for his family (his wife Gabby played by the lovely Kelly Preston and talented newcomer Joseph Cross plays son Charlie), the demands on his time at the onset of his musical career cause him to miss out on a lot of time with them as well as important events in his son's life. The movie doesn't make Jack out to be a bad father/husband. It's apparent in his interactions/conversations with his wife and son that he's not unaware of what he's missing, he regrets it, and he's really trying to make it better (with realistic commitments set upon him by his job-relatable to all of us). The family dynamic here is truly special as they openly discuss their issues/feelings (without it being cheesy, since the dialogue is so witty and concise). Ever supportive, the family tries to work out plans so that Jack can live out his dreams (very important too) without missing out on his family life at the same time. These early scenes produce some of the greatest laughs of the movie, in my opinion. The dialogue is clever and honest. Also, despite the fact that we know this is going to turn into a snowman movie shortly, some of these moments within the family rank up for me among the most genuine and touching that I've ever seen in a family film.

So, Jack must miss out on Christmas morning with his family so he can travel with his band to a gig in order to get signed to a record deal. Halfway there, Jack decides he's made the wrong decision and heads home to surprise his wife and son. Tragically, he meets an untimely end on the way there. Now we cut to one year later and Charlie is a changed little boy. Still a sweet young man, he's understandably filled with deep sadness and disappointment over the loss. When it hits him the hardest, he goes out to build a snowman like he did with his father the year before and then blows on a ""magic harmonica"" that Jack had pretended he would always be able to hear. Surprisingly enough, the magic works and Jack has a chance to spend some real quality time with his son and help him through this terrible turn of events. The result is a hilarious, snow-filled, Christmas movie with a lighthearted, but sob-worthy ending. Who would have thought? :) Very impressive!",964569600,3,2427,4.528473804100228
