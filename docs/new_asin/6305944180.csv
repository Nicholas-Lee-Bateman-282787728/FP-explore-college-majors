So when I ordered it on VHS, I wasn't expecting much.  It's not the greatest quality, but it was a lot better than the TV's quality.
The story itself is a bit interesting... and after watching how many times I still don't get the ending, but it kept my attention.  Nothing like the newer movies coming out.  I don't go to movies just for the fact I'd probably fall asleep due to a stolen plot/story that I've already seen before.
Some of the actors are just pathetic.  You just want to meet them in person to kill them. What do you expect, though?

Certainly not among the greats but has a lot of that great suspense and mood from this era of horror films. Most of today's horror films are about armies of zombies munching on the living or a ""psycho slasher"" stalking the local girls dormitory.  This film has some great under-rated actors, an interesting ""film within a film"" subplot, haunting music and a steady build up of suspense.  The ending as well as the beginning was very strange and creepy.

If you enjoy these kinds of movies, I suggest you check out ""Svengooli"" (previously called Son of Svengooli) Svengoolie is a hosted horror movie show.

it's not particularly frightening, far from it, but it is kind of like a time machine; it's so dated, hence the fascination and curiosity to see it through.
It's almost a bit like ""Dark Shadows""; not quite but it's kind of hokey in that way.
Taking liberties with all things occult and spiritual in nature, they decided to the Tibetan Book of The Dead as a book of ""dark magic' and necromancy, which could not be further from the truth, but it is typical of that time when the West was just beginning to learn about Eastern religions and the like.

1092011,4,6305944180,"This is a decent horror flick from the first half of the 1970s, from the age when Hammer was still the somewhat-fading standard and the horror genre had not yet become associated with the trend towards explicit gore and naked teenagers started by the impacts of ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th.""  Carradine chews the scenery a bit, but that shouldn't surprise anyone who's watched much horror from this era.

One pleasant surprise for those interested in the history of the genre is that it marks the only other screen appearance in a horror film that I know about of the late Laurie Bartram, who played Brenda in the original ""Friday the 13th.""  She isn't credited in this film, but there aren't that many tall sweet-faced brunettes in it.  She must have been a person worth knowing, as I have never read or heard a single fellow cast or crew member say anything at all negative about her.  After ""Friday the 13th,"" finding her acting career in increasing conflict with her religious beliefs, she quit show business altogether, moved to Lynchburg, Virginia, and died of pancreatic cancer at the tragically young age of 49, so any sighting of her on screen is going to be a rarity.",1386201600,5,1182,4.718446601941747

If you contact Severin Films (which you can do via their Facebook page), you can get the address to send them back the defective DVD and they will send you a replacement.  More recent copies shipped out from Severin should already have the defective disc replaced.

Severin Films has given tender loving care to this old favorite of mine that I first saw on late night TV.  Other copies aren't nearly as clear and it is important to understanding the plot in some cases that you be able to see clearly what is going on.  Enter Severin with their BluRay disc of this movie.  I won't spoil it but one scene shows something that really isn't mentioned.  It's subtle but it kind of helps drive home a plot point and although the movie still contains a few lapses in logic, one part of the story is made clearer just for being able to see what's going on.  Extras are good.  Commentary by the producer is helpful and an old interview with John Carradine is nice and they even found a trailer for this.

1092136,3,6305944180,"I have heard the title THE HOUSE OF SEVEN CORPSES a few times over the years but never saw it in any of the video stores I frequented, nor did I know anyone that had watched it.  So, when the fine folks at CAV and Severin announced they were releasing it on Blu-ray, I figured I had to give it a shot.  After all, it was originally released one month after I was born.  I watched it alone, late at night, and enjoyed it for the most part, although it does have some annoying aspects here and there.

To truly appreciate a film like this, you have to look at the time period in which it was made.  Hammer Horror was winding down in the early 70s, however the Gothic presence from its Golden Years was still impacting films in these days.  As a result, many filmmakers, both domestic and foreign, were still trying to capture that dark, brooding feel.  THE HOUSE OF SEVEN CORPSES is one of those attempts.  And while it does manage to do so, the film itself drags for a while before things start to happen.

The slow build-up is the primary flaw in this film, unfortunately.  It is 90 minutes long, but the first 60 minutes is spent trying to get the audience to believe in and care about the characters.  This is a bit hard to do, given their two-dimensional personalities.  But once the action starts, the interest in the film picks up considerably.

I wish I could understand the ending better, but it honestly didn't make sense to me.  I went back and re-watched the twist, just to see if I had missed something.  But I was still left confused.

Still, even though I've listed a couple of negatives here, the film is entertaining overall and it is a nice homage to Hammer's Gothic atmospheres.  The zombie effects look excellent and I would love to see how they put them together.

The digital transfer for THE HOUSE OF SEVEN CORPSES looks amazing; the clarity of the picture on Blu-ray is excellent for a 40 year-old film, and the sound quality is nice as well.  There are some scene transitions in the original film that are jerky and therefore probably couldn't be fixed in the transfer, but that is simply due to the editing quality of the time period.

THE HOUSE OF SEVEN CORPSES will be a win for fans of old-style horror and nostalgic 70s trips back in time.  Be sure and check this one out on Blu-ray if you get the chance; the HD is definitely worth the extra money.  This film is available now.",1376438400,3,2406,4.383747178329571

all the previous tenants have met a terrible demise. Some of the

We used to take bets on who killed the ageing diva's (Faith Domergue's) cat Cleon (My money was on the director of the film within a film, John Ireland) as well as wonder why a witch like Mrs. Beale (at the start of the movie, they were re-enacting a seance scene for the movie the soon to be victims were shooting) would need a gun to protect herself from the Zombie she was summoning? John Carradine (who interrupts  the seance/film shoot at the beggining of the movie) joined an excellent cast, including Faith and John, to put together a scary little film on a shoestring budget that is still fun and suspenseful even after multiple viewings. OK, you have to suspend disbelief, but that goes for most movies that provide escapist entertainment. As for the movie being violent, next to watching the evening news these days ""The House of Seven Corpses"" looks like a quiet walk in the park! The DVD is a high quality ""Image"" release and is recently available at a bargain price on top of it. It was originally selling at a fairly high list price, it is now quite a bargain here at our favorite internet site, Amazon[.com]. The wonders of the American recession! Don't forget the popcorn and don't put out the cat! Do enjoy this film on a stormy night curled up on the coach preferably with company, or at least the cat.",1030492800,27,1585,4.484429065743945
1092240,3,6305944180,"Filmed in the Utah governor's mansion, this little cheap-o goodie is low on sense and high on atmosphere.  It's highly entertaining, no matter how you choose to view it.  On the one hand, it's actually pretty good as a simple, straightforward low-budget horror film; on the other, it's so cheaply made and (in some ways) nonsensical that you can good-naturedly laugh at it.
The story is a movie in a movie, which is always an enjoyable conceit:  director John Ireland shoots a low-budget picture in the haunted Beal mansion, the owners of which all came to untimely and violent ends.  The cast and crew don't take it very seriously, though middle-aged actress Faith Domergue (one of Howard Hughes' favorites, still surprisingly beautiful) wants to do her best since she is concerned about her future job prospects.  In the interest of making the black-magic angle of the movie more believable  -  caretaker John Carradine heaps scorn on the filmmakers for their blatant disregard concerning the house's actual history  -  Domergue reads part of the script's ritual from a Latin translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead found among the Beals' belongings, and ends up raising a little real hell from the family graveyard...which causes the film's cast to gradually succumb to the same violent demises formerly suffered by the unfortunate Beals.
For as cheap a movie as this is, it's shot quite beautifully.  The color is especially vivid and rich, and the cinematography is pretty crisp.  There are looped sequences and some shoddy day-for-night photography, but it's rather impressive in spite of that.  Dominic Frontiere's moody first season Outer Limits score is recycled for the soundtrack, to good effect.  The actors play it all for real, and remain surprisingly credible.  And the action sometimes surprisingly sucks you in, with a few gruesome and shuddery moments.
The film's logic flaws are legion  -  whoever dreamed up a Latin translation of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, for instance?  -  and its ending won't stand up to close scrutiny.  But if you're partial to those old Creepy and Eerie magazine stories that used to be put out by Warren Publishing, you'll love this flick  -  it performs exactly like those schlock horror mags read.",1029196800,31,2251,4.997311827956989
1092241,4,6305944180,"I wasn't expecting much from The House of Seven Corpses, and for that reason the fact that this horror film is clever (but not too clever) and funny (but not too funny) came as a pleasant surprise. Others have already commented on the plot, which doesn't altogether make sense on a literal level, but symbolically makes perfect sense, so I'll just comment on some of my fave things about this movie.
The irony and self-reflexiveness that the film-within-a-film made possible was my favourite aspect. I hate the newer movies that have that sort of humour, but this film wasn't smug and in-your-face about it, so it worked for me. Especially the ending, where one of the zombies drops a... well, I won't say, but it's perfect!
I love the way they used cross-cutting, and the montage sequences were neat in a cheesy way. The directing was wanna-be Hitchcock (esp. the use of mirrors), but on a low budget, even Hitch would look like a wanna-be of himself.
Another funny bit was when one of the actresses discovers her cat Cleon cut in half and she goes into hysterics. Then later, if you look closely, you can see John Carradine's character (Price) chiselling the cat's name onto a headstone. No one draws attention to it, but if you're sharp you'll catch the name. Also, there are lots of other visual jokes which I found myself rewinding the movie to laugh at again.
About the actors- no Academy Award performances here, but everyone was competent. The tyrant director (played by John Ireland) was my fave of all. It was great when the zombie was chasing him and he notices the film scattered all over the floor and gets more upset over that than being stalked by a killing machine (My film! Oh God!). While this movie is not a masterpice, it's good for a laugh or two.",1017964800,8,1768,4.6158730158730155
1092242,4,6305944180,"There is a definite generation gap when it comes to appreciation of films in general and horror films in particular.  At a mere 36 years old (OK, 37),  I have no tolerance for the likes of The Mummy with Brendan Frasier or most other mass market video games masquerading as films.  This stuff is all empty, loud, mind-numbing product, no different from the Coca-Cola you drink when you watch it.  If this kind of talk is making you angry, you will not at all be interested in The House of the Seven Corpses, which is atmospheric, well-scripted and DOES feature rotting corpses. BUT they don't run really fast in massive groups, and the hero is about 65 years old so it wouldn't be becoming for him to leap 20 feet into the air and sever all 7 corpses at once.
  Seven reasons to see The House of Seven Corpses:
1) Intriguing film-within-a-film self-reflexive weirdness
2) Clever dialogue as delivered by John Ireland
3) Cantankerous dialogue as delivered by John Carradine
4) A chance to stay with the entire cast for several nights at the creepy Governors' Mansion in  Utah
5) Eerie choral musical score AND stock music from Outer Limits
6) Convincing rotting corpses
7) Opening credits sequence
If that's not enough, I have more.  If you're still reading this, hopefully a few of the reasons above will suffice.  And for those of you who think this film is awful, I understand why a measly seven corpses, with only two of them SLOWLY coming back to life, will not.",1011139200,94,1466,4.629343629343629
1092243,2,6305944180,"This movie is only recommended to those looking for some bad movies to laugh at. It is no Ed Wood, but in comparison, Ed Wood is FAR better at creating coherent plots.  No, I'm not upset that there weren't 7 zombies in this movie (there are only 2), and I do love old fashioned horror movies.  But the scriptwriter's inability to count even to 7 is only one example of this film's incoherence.
The movie starts out by showing a series of five-second clips of 6 (NOT 7) people in period costumes dying in an old mansion in various ways (stabbed to death, falling off a second floor landing, etc.). Flashforward to the present. The mansion is now owned by John Carridine and is being rented by a movie crew making a film based on the history of the mansion and how 3 (not 6 or 7) of its residents met a violent end. Most of the movie is then taken up by scenes of the actors, director and film crew shooting scenes or squabbling amongst themselves. Meanwhile Carradine (who only makes a few cameo appearances) spends his time hanging around the graveyard out back, rereading the headstones over and over again and at one point climbs down into an empty grave, all in an effort to determine the identity of whoever's buried in the empty grave (don't ask me -- I'm also confused).
At one point, one of the actresses finds half the body of her pet cat (it is never explained who did it, how or why). Finally, in about the last ten minutes of the movie, they film a scene in which one character reads a spell to raise the dead. Unbeknownst to the crew, the spell is real and it revives one corpse buried in the cemetary out back (I believe it was the guy stabbed to death). The zombie kills Carradine then 3 of the film crew. The actress who owned the dead cat gets scared when she hears someone coming up the stairs. It is actually a fellow actor, but that doesn't stop her from accidentally shooting him 5 or 6 times! The zombie then pops out of hiding and kills her. Another actress falls down dead instantly just from looking at the zombie.
Meanwhile, one actor and the director are filming exterior night shots. They find Carradine lying next to the newly empty grave (now somehow neatly dug out). The actor goes nuts and attempts to push the director into the hole. The actor falls in instead and instantly becomes a decades old corpse (?!?!) and kills the director. The end.
The body count: 6 dead 75 years ago, 3 dead in the movie-within-a -movie, and (not counting the cat) 9 dead in the present. Oh yeah, two of the murders in the present superficially resemble 2 of the deaths 75 years ago, but none of the other 6 do. The scriptwriter, who also is responsible for Puff'n'Stuff, must have been blowing on his magic flute too often.",1006732800,5,2736,4.415841584158416
