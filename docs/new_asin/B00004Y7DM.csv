7926830,4,B00004Y7DM,"Another bit of info on this Fastinating man.  So many books and now this informative collection of film, photo and impressions of his friends simply confirms the legend.  Howard was brilliant but obviously aware of his declining mental state. Worth watching if you want to know more about the evasive Howard Hughes.",1285718400,,315,5.038461538461538

7926832,4,B00004Y7DM,"Howard Hughes was a strange man. He made several major films including Hell's Angels, Scarface, and The Outlaw, pushing the censors all the way. He loved flying planes which made him a hero but also caused problems for him. He adored women and dated almost every famous name in Hollywood during his lifetime. He also was partially deaf and suffered from OCD.

The film The Aviator turned Hughes into a major figure again. Many people who had never heard of the man got to know him. This documentary, through film clips, re-enactments, and interviews. It covers many of the points that The Aviator depicted and explains them better in relation to the rest of Hughes' life. It also covers a topic that many were outraged was omitted from the biopic: his relationship with Billie Dove.

Narrated by Billy Zane and running about 58 minute long, this documentary is an adequate summation of the life of a very complex man.",1151625600,15,917,4.761006289308176
