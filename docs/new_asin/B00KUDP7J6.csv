8661802,5,B00KUDP7J6,"Great anime that turns the tails on the pretty sailor girl genre.  Not really for kids, but a good and complex plot.",1406160000,,116,4.2727272727272725
8661803,5,B00KUDP7J6,"As Mami's recent demise paints more and more what this series actually is--and the sort of darkness the rest of the story will follow--it only means a more engrossing plot for the viewers! This awesome DVD brings many truths to light: just who is the Kyoko girl we saw at the end of disc 1? What will Sayaka's fate be as a Magical Girl? Will Madoka ever come under contract? And just what is Homura's deal, and what's her connection to Madoka? All this and more comes into question in the middle of the franchise. And as it's a truly fantastic ride, I suggest you strap in and see just what this saga is trying to tell us!",1369440000,,622,4.279661016949152
8661804,4,B00KUDP7J6,"I'm so happy they made these limited edition box sets!  This review is about the packaging and so forth and not the show, which would get a 11/10 review from me.

PROS:
-BluRay looks amazing compared to just DVD
-Artwork on box looks fantastic.
-Artwork on BluRay/DVD looks fantastic.
-Soundtrack is great! over 10 songs.
-Interviews with the creators and voice actors was fun to read and think about while watching.

CONS:
The posters are all folded up and have deadly creases in them.
The boxes aren't very sturdy, it is very thin and white, which looks great, but I think they could get stained very easily since there is no protective plastic film or anything.

OVERALL:
I loved getting this, one of the best anime I have seen.  The artwork inside is very cute, and the soundtrack sealed the deal for me.  I love the music.",1355702400,4,827,4.591836734693878
