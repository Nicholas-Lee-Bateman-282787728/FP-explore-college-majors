8136891,5,B000H61X62,I'M almost 77 and my Girlfriend Older but I had better not mention her Age...Anyway I had an entire set of the VHS tapes my daughter gave me years ago and I gave them all away except for the Advanced but I can only do about 8 to 10 Mins which is great for me and my Girl Friend. I miss the 8 Min one so I am Glad I found it! Like Billy says everyone has at least 8 mins for a work out..I do mine just before I shower listening to Chuck Berry CD and Billy Banks Voice in the Back Ground pushing all them Gals and Guys on the Advanced video I sometime leave the tape on when I do My Light Barbell and Dumbell Excs on Mon Wed and Fridays..Thanks Billy Banks..Still think Billy should produce a SENIOR TAEBO WORK OUT DVD before HE gets too old..Just a thought.,1445558400,,756,3.947712418300654
8136892,5,B000H61X62,"This workout video is great! Every morning I will workout to the Tae-Bo instructional video and then pop this one in once I'm done. I had this video along time ago and lost it when I moved. I'm so glad I was able to find one because I get a great workout when I do both the instructional and 8 minute.
