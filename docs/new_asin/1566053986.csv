186650,4,1566053986,"It seems that Rhino's strategy for releasing MST3K tapes is to include a film from every genre.  Not really a bad idea to tell the truth.  There is a western (Gunslinger), UFO flick (MST3K:The Movie), 70s cop movie  (Mitchell), etc.  The only qualm is that eventually you will get a movie  that, while incredibly hilarious, isn't at the peak of the best MST3K  movies.
That is the feeling I have for BotE.  It is funny, but I am sure  there are even better episodes to release.

Peter Graves (the bug guy) and Peggy Castle (girl reporter with a great car) and a host of others to serve as grasshopper food (many of whom you'll recognize from other films of this type and 1950s TV).

...The Boys take on another Bert Gordon pain parade with Giant mutant crickets from 1957! Mike and the Bots attempt to sing some classic standards but someone keeps dialing the wrong number.

The back story which I heard from TCM Turner Classic Movies or it might have been the original American Movie Classic channel.

186707,4,1566053986,"Yes, I like all these old, cheesy sci-fi movies from the 1950's. And this is one of my favorites. It's got the usual terrible (by today's standards) special effects, giant bugs that wreak havoc and threaten mankind's existence, and Peggy Castle. Peggy Castle was also on Warner Brothers TV western, Lawman, and is a personal favorite. Watching a movie like this is really a look back in the history of movie making, because many pioneering efforts were used in the 50's to create the pictures on the screen. Today we would laugh at actors running in place in front of a movie screen showing action in the background; or maybe dismiss the tedium of a Ray Harryhausen meticulously placing the parts of small models for a stop motion take. Compared to today's CGI effects, it all seems quaint and archaic. And that is the charm. Primitive, sure, but effective nonetheless. And back then - you screamed your head off.

Its also a lot of fun, with some of the worst FX ever created.  The dialog is atrocious, the acting limited, the plot has definitely been used often and better.  The story is all talk and no action; most of the horror is hearsay.  Not for one moment is Peter Graves believable as a doctor of whatever.  Peggie Castle makes a peculiar reporter, obviously more concerned with fashion than sensible shoes.  More an oddity than anything else, this movies best feature is just how awful it is.  Theres almost a sense of genius in its ineptitude.  I happily made it a part of my collection and have watched it on more than one occasion.  It is a hoot.

The movie spent about a half hour with everyone wondering what was causing the deaths and I can imagine a viewer in the 50's who didn't know going in enjoying the suspense. Pretty (of course) newspaper reporter Peggie Castle is on the case and gets a surprising amount of cooperation from the National Guard and later the Army. It is also worth noting that while by the end of the movie it was obvious she and our hero Peter Graves were an item, there wasn't a lot of romantic sub plot.

Its enjoyable seeing Graves in this role as the scientist in charge with figuring out how to stop the Hoppers (who don't do any hopping) and using a machine gun to mow down the critters more effectively than all the soldiers combined.

I really enjoyed this movie and would rank this just a cut below ""Them"". While the early shots of the the grasshoppers clearly look like film running behind the actors I found the final scenes of them climbing the Chicago skyscrapers very well done for the time. Also look for some familiar TV character actors (hint: Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies). I was concerned about the picture quality before I started watching when I saw it was from something called ""Hen's Tooth Video"", but there were no issues.

Only Graves can save us and along with his deaf/mute friend (who later gets eaten) and a female reporter he is able to turn back the challenge of the locusts.

There's a lot of bad dialogue, the effects are typical sometimes and bad at other times even for that era, the pacing is off and when the locusts attack Chicago its obvious the buildings they climb are on postcards, which is so laughable. The final shot where the grasshoppers are lead to water and drown is so totally bad its hilarious.

Mike and his crew do a great job with this one, they rip on the effects, Graves himself especially with some ""Biography"" quotes and they just let loose with everything in the final sequence. Its so funny and so worth getting, for a good price, if you're lucky to find it cheap that is.",1310515200,3,983,4.548022598870056

During MST3K's 3rd and 4th season, we practically had a BURT I. GORDON retrospective, with at least 6 films riffed on by this director-writer-special effects master. (ah-hum.) However, after Joel's escape, Mike just did this one film by Burt, ""BEGINNING OF THE END."" Is the Title ominous enough for you? Naturally, some of the best parts of this movie resides with the dramas between movie sign. For example, WHITE TRASH LADY, aka Mary Jo, appears on the Hexscreen and wants to talk to Arnie. (wrong number!) Also, Mike calls the Mads impromtu, and catches part of their ""alternative"" lifestyle. (one of the great bits from the TRACE years, is that whole closeted gay thing between TV's FRANK, and Clayton.) Also, after watching the grasshoppers craw OVER the postcard of a Chicago skyscaper, MIKE shows us how BURT I. made his process shots. (Not exactly a cinema breakthru, more like a cinema see-thru.) All in all, BERT I.GORDON, with Peter Graves giving us a dose of hilarious melodrama, and GRASSHOPPERS all messed up on atomic radiation, and some pretty cool skits, you have the ingredients for one of the better Comedy Central Experiments.

It is worth noting, that the company that brings us the new Box sets, is selling this title NEW on their web site. In Fact, they are also giving us the ability to buy NEW that SCIFI episode from the deleted box set number 9, ""the Incredible creatures who stopped living and became messed up Zombies"". I was hoping that Box set #9 would be resold someday without the ""problem"" film, but that's probibly not going to happen. So, starting with this film, and THE INCREDIBLE CREATURES THAT STOPPED LIVING, that company who makes the new Box sets will be selling this DVD new again.

186719,3,1566053986,"Along a long stretch of straight country road in eastern Illinois there is a clump of trees amid the farm fields where the teens like to park late at night.  On one particularly warm summer evening after midnight, a single car is parked there with a teenage couple engaged in the usual closed-eyed necking.  The top is down and the radio is blaring the latest doo-wop. The boy's mother probably thinks the new music is repulsive; it is too bad the insects don't find it so.  The girl opens her eyes, looks up, and screams.  The boy only has a moment left to wonder, look up, and ...

The next day, a reporter, driving south from Chicago, encounters a road block manned by the Illinois National Guard.  Her assignment was to get a story on a new aircraft at Chanute Field, but sensing a story behind the road block, she stops to inquire.  The tight-lipped guard tells her nothing.  She drives out-of-sight, parks, and foots it over the hill and finds a mystery ...

Later that day, she drives out to an Illinois agricultural experimental station, meets the project director, and convinces him to take her out to a grain elevator that, six months before, had been mysteriously destroyed as if by a tornado.  While searching through the rubble for remaining grains of wheat, one of the researchers belatedly discovers that they should have placed screens around their experiments back at the station ...

This is a low budget movie with a very thin script.  A better movie of this type is 'Them!'

Special note to aviation buffs: there is a very short shot of a flying B-36 bomber.

This movie runs 76 minutes with a silly Rhino commercial at the beginning for almost two minutes.  Rhino put out this movie in 1998 on VHS and I have a pristine copy.  I wanted a DVD but then Amazon ran out of them and now only Marketplace sellers are offering them for $77.00 and up.

This has a good story, doesn't run too long, isn't idiotic and has ""logical"" premise.  There were lots of movies about monster bugs, etc. (Ants in Them, Spiders in They), who came from nuclear bomb tests in those days but this one is different.

Yes, there are artifacts in the film but it doesn't jump and only the night scenes are hard to watch.  I watched this on a 50"" plasma so all of the defects were exagerated but I really didn't notice - I was paying attention to the story.  Most people watching home videos in VHS in 1998 must have had 17"" to 25"" inch televisions so they might not have noticed the defects then.

I saw some complaints about special effects but geez! it is 1958!  I thought they did a good job!

In the film, entomologist Peter ""Have you ever seen a grown man naked?"" Graves and his deaf/mute botanist partner have succeeded in using radiation to grow large fruits and vegetables.  The idea is to end world hunger, but who wants to eat radioactive fruit?  Grasshoppers eat the food, grow enormous and destroy half of Illinois(which I suppose isn't too terrible as long as they destroy all the damn toll booths while they're at it).  I can't help but wonder why it's only grasshoppers.  I mean, other insects eat tomatoes and strawberries too, ya know?  Anyhow, Graves has to race against the clock to find a way to destroy the grasshoppers before they drop The Bomb on Chicago.
Yup, it's Bert I Gordon in the house again!  Yup, it's rear projection grasshoppers!  And yup, there is a scene on a high rise apartment where a half naked woman is grooming herself in a mirror and a grasshopper appears at the window and smashes his way in!

186735,4,1566053986,"Another Bert I. Gordon masterpiece, ""The Beginning of the End"" features a wooden Peter Graves waxing philosophic about the effects of radiation on locusts (not grasshoppers), which have grown to varying sizes and are maurauding through an oddly-mountainous Illinois, dispatching of entire towns.  Graves is accompanied by a plucky female journalist and (briefly) a deaf-mute gardening assistant.  Add in half-hearted special effects (shot after shot of locusts crawling up postcards of buildings) and some leery directing (an opening car sequence that takes forever to end; a lascivious locust staring into an apartment at a freshly showered woman in a towl), and you've got your typical D-Grade schlock.

This is one of the first episodes from the Mike Nelson season (the back of the DVD box features Joel's friendly mug; don't be fooled), and as such, there is some hesitancy in the jokes, some ground feeling.  The opening host segment -- where Mike receives a bizarre phone call from a trailer trash mom who thinks he's someone else -- sets a great tone for the show, as does the invention exchange (the ""Re-Comfy-Bike"" and new playing cards), but the movie is such a dud that the riffs are often repetitive and rare.

The host segments inject a bit of life into the dullness.  One of them though, a deliberately non-funny stand-up routine by Tom, is SO deliberately non-funny that it ... well, it really isn't funny, mirroring in a sad way the status of the entire film.  The joke of the show hinges on movies that are so bad they're funny, but every once in a while the MST3K crew finds a movie that's so bad it's, well, it's nothing but bad.  ""The Beginning of the End"" comes close to that; after all, there are only so many jokes that can be made about long, ponderous silences and recycled dialogue/scenes.  Mike and the bots do the best they can here, but the end result is just so-so.  For die-hard collectors only.",1170633600,2,1926,4.8090909090909095

Such is the plot in the '57 low budget bugfest 'Beginning of the End.' An immense swarm of grasshoppers get into an experimental site using radioactive feed to enhance plant growth in order to increase the size of fruits and vegetables. An altrustic scientific project to provide alternative food supplies in the event of any future food shortages. However good intentions don't always produce positive results, as in this case.

You guessed it, the grasshoppers chow down on the plant food and before long begin to grow to the size of a school bus. Fortunately their wings don't develop in keeping with their new body size so they can't fly, but unfortunately with their ever increasing need for food they decide to focus on the nearest human for their next meal.

Imagine tens of thousands of gigantic grasshoppers covering the landscape as the march towards the next population center in search of fast food to go. Pretty scary don't you think? Who can ever forget that impressive battle scene when the U.S. Army take on the thundering herd and get wiped out. I can still hear the field commander on the walkie-talkie discribing the onslaught to General Hanson (Morris Ankrum), ""Still they come from way back! We're being cut-off!""

Oh ho ho, it's so hard to keep the snails and ...uh...grasshoppers out of the giant-fruit-making equipment. But the shoe doesn't drop. Later, the assistant gets eaten by a giant grasshopper, Peter and The Girl go to Washington and get dissed by some generals until someone calls on the phone, Pete explains that the grasshoppers can't fly because they were somehow mutated when they got huge but he doesn't mention why they can't hop. I mean, I'm not a grasshopper expert but I've tried to pick them up and they hop away. No hopping in this show. Probably too expensive to get footage of hopping grasshoppers.

Granted, my Peter Graves impersonation works much better when you can actually hear me do it, but you can't talk about MST3K's hilarious send-up of The Beginning of the End without following in Crow's footsteps and doing constant Peter Graves impressions.  This is classic MST3K, the fifth experiment featuring Mike Nelson as the human test subject on the Satellite of Love.  Those of us Joel loyalists who feared for the future of the show needn't have worried, as Mike took his new role in front of the cameras and flew with it.  He was, of course, helped greatly by movies such as this one.  Any Bert I.

The film itself features gigantic locusts laying waste to the state of Illinois, and the finest military force in the world finds itself thoroughly licked by the onslaught.  Of course, things don't start out with a lot of excitement.  This is a Bert I. Gordon movie, after all.  The very first shot after the opening credits shows us a road with a vehicle approaching in the distance - way back in the distance, so far back you sit there and sit there wondering if anything is actually going to happen before you even spot the car.  Then, Gordon throws us right into a big mystery; it seems the town of Ludlow, Illinois, has been destroyed, its population of 150 vanished into thin air.  The National Guard's there, but they aren't talking, not even to famous journalist Audrey Ames (Peggy Castle).  As the story begins to emerge, though, she joins up with Dr. Wainwright (Graves), a local entomologist, and quickly discovers that it's all Wainwright's fault.  He's the one who was growing all the radioactive super-sized vegetables, which proved to be quite appetizing to locusts, and now there's a bazillion of the little buggers grown to immense size and destroying everything in their path.  Surprisingly, the military folks don't immediately embrace this story of a plague of gigantic locusts, but they soon learn just what they are up against - and fail miserably when they try to take the critters out.  Emerging out of the, ahem, world-famous Illinois mountains, the horde of mega-locusts make a, ahem, bee-line for Chicago - apparently, the locusts are Cubs fans who just can't take bear the thought of another season without a pennant.  Perhaps the very fate of humanity rests in Peter Graves' hands, and his ultimate solution involves giving a locust a lie-detector test.  Run for your lives!

Once the locusts get to Chicago, Bert I. Gordon goes a little crazy showing grasshoppers crawling all over postcards (I mean, buildings).  There's no way the guys at Best Brains could have resisted riffing such a film.  The fun doesn't stop in the theater, either.

This low-budget big bug movie probably went over pretty well in the late 1950s, but today it just looks silly.  Actually, watching grown, well-armed men run away from grasshoppers would look funny no matter how technically proficient the special effects are.  No one is going to make the mistake of thinking these locusts are really gigantic, especially since they vary widely in size depending on the perspective of each scene.  A couple of times, the locusts look as if they are really there with the characters, but those good shots are rarities indeed.  Yes, the 50s was all about superimposing harmless little backyard critters onto low-budget films and passing them off as unstoppable monsters threatening the very survival of humanity, and no one did it quite like Bert I. Gordon.  With a musical score by Albert Glasser, The Beginning of the End is a double whammy of ""radioactive super-sized creatures are attacking"" fun.",1114214400,4,3210,4.851376146788991
186742,2,1566053986,"A review by the students in ENT 201, Insects on Film (Clemson University, Clemson, SC) Spring 2005

When better to meet your new man than while saving the world from GIANT radioactive grasshoppers! That's what happened to Audrey Ames in Beginning of the End. The black and white movie, produced in 1957, takes place in a small Illinois town called Ludlow, near the big city of Chicago. The main character, Audrey, is a persistent reporter who discovers a new and interesting story on her way to write about a lackluster flying demonstration.  On her way to the flying demo, she is stopped at a roadblock in the town of Ludlow, Illinois.  It seems that the town has been mysteriously destroyed overnight! Following a lead, Audrey goes to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and meets with the project director named Dr. Ed Wainwright in order to find out more about what happened. Dr. Wainwright tells Audrey about a wheat factory that was demolished in the same area before the destruction of Ludlow. Ed, Audrey and Ed's co-worker, Frank, go to investigate the abandoned grain bins. While they are there, a locust comes from the woods and eats Ed's co-worker. They finally realize what is destroying the towns and eating the people-although it's a little too late for poor Frank Johnson.

Determined to resolve the problem, the military enlists the help of Dr. Wainwright, who tries to find a sound frequency that mimics the sound grasshoppers make before they attack. The viewer of this film will be held in utter suspense, until, at a climatic moment, Dr. Wainwright discovers the right frequency and saves the city of Chicago from the military's impending drop of an atom bomb.  The sound is broadcast from a boat in a lake outside of Chicago and the sound attracts the grasshoppers to the lake. As the grasshoppers follow the luring sound, they eventually end up in the lake where they meet a watery death.  The city of Chicago is safe and everyone lives happily ever after (except, sadly, those who were eaten alive by the radioactive grasshoppers).

While this movie has extremely entertaining moments, such as when the grasshoppers scale the skyscrapers of Chicago looking for food-the movie, in general, is a B attempt at science fiction. Also, the movie was produced during the 1950s, resulting in minimal attempts at realistic special effects. The special effects are entertaining at best and add humor more than substance to the movie.  The viewer also might be left with several questions after watching this movie-like why can't the National Guard protect the citizens from grasshoppers? Or, why is it more funny than tragic when Dr. Wainwright's deaf/mute assistance gets eaten alive by a grasshopper?

On a scientific or scholarly level, the movie has several errors. The most important error, in the entomological sense, is the noise that the grasshoppers make throughout the movie. To make the noise that they did in the movie, they would need wings. In the movie though, the characters say that the grasshoppers could not fly because they didn't have wings.  Also, the scientist indicates that the giant vegetables were produced through radioactivity, which allows for photosynthesis to occur both day and night.  For photosynthesis to occur, light must be present, thus raising the question of how the vegetables could continue to expand during the darkness of night.  The inability of the grasshoppers to burn in the fires set by the military reflects an error as well.  In reality, grasshoppers are highly flammable because of their wax-like coating.  Finally, the plot as a whole is completely unrealistic and so bizarre that the movie should be placed in the comedy (opposed to science fiction) genre. While Clemson University research may have led to the evacuation of mole crickets from golf course greens, using technological concepts similar to those presented in the movie, the likelihood that radioactive grasshoppers would eat hundreds of people is improbable.

Beginning of the End is an amusing movie to watch! The acting is traditional of the sci-fi movies of the era. The special effects are mediocre, but the humor, in retrospect, is delightful. If you are a fan of cheesy sci-fi suspense movies, give this flick a try! You will not be disappointed.

It seems that they got into some experimental crops where radioactive isotopes were used to generate a fertilizer that allowed fruit to grow to enormous proportions.  These giants begin moving North where they wipe out a number of other towns including Joliet.  Soon Chicago is in danger.
Peter Graves, the scientist who is sort of responsible for the creation of the monsters, sets up a lab in the Wrigley building.  It is hope to lure all of the locusts into one spot and then lure them into Lake Michigan where they will drown.  If he is unable to succeed within a certain time period, Chicago will be bombed in hopes of wiping out the menace.
Like the movie THEM, BEGINNING OF THE END is a superior giant bug movie.  The movie gives the impression that someone actually did a little research before writing the screenplay.  So if you want to see some great shots of a Chicago that no longer exists this is a good movie.  If you also like giant bugs then this is a great movie.

186745,4,1566053986,"""I'm Peter Graves. This week on Biography, the story of how I defeated a horde of radioactive mutant grasshoppers who invaded Chicago.""
""The Beginning of the End"" (episode #517) is a typical episode from the Mike Nelson years of the classic TV show ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"": in other words, it's hysterical, satiric, and pop-culturally sharp from beginning to end (even when the End is just Beginning!). The movie itself isn't horrendously awful -- certainly not on the level of some other flicks screened on the program, like ""Eegah!"" and ""Manos: The Hands of Fate."" But it is the perfect kind of stuffy, quickly slapped together ""B"" Atomic horror movie of the 50s that people associate so closely with the show. And at this point Mike and the `Bots were firing on all cylinders, and the comedy is non-stop. Mike had only recently taken over the role as host from Joel Hodgson, and it is with this episode that he finally seems completely at ease with his role.
If you're unfamiliar with this amazing comedy show (known as ""MST3K"" to fans), here's what you need to know: a human (Mike Nelson or Joel Hodgson) and his two mechanized pals, Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo, appear in a silhouette of a theater seats projected in front of a bad movie. The three hosts provide sidesplitting commentary to the film, filled with popular culture references and smart-aleck bitterness. The movie-watching sequences are occasionally interrupted with comedic sketches and musical numbers, making for an all-encompassing comedic experience: a humorous puppet-show sitcom with cynical wisecracks that turn rotten movies into fabulous entertainment.
""The Beginning of the End"" was released in 1957 by independent director-effects technician Bert I. Gordon, who rivaled Roger Corman in this period as the top creator of `B' science-fiction cheapies. Gordon was obviously trying to copy the success of the classic giant-ant movie ""Them!"", only with giant grasshoppers instead. The film's tagline is a classic of ridiculous overstatement: ""So Big...we had to coin a new words for it...NEWMENDOUS!"" It's all downhill from there, folks.
Peter Graves plays the stock scientist character who discovers that the recent vanishing of an Illinois town was caused by giant locusts, who mutated after they consumed some of his radioactive-treated plants in his laboratory (good one, Peter!). He and perky female reporter Peggie Castle try to warn the military in time, but soon the flightless locust plague descends on Chicago. Can anything stop them? Well, yes, since they're obviously just normal-sized grasshoppers optically matted over the footage, an effect that never looks good and lacks the magic and fun of stop-motion or suitmation techniques. Some of the effects are unbelievably rotten, such as the scenes of grasshoppers climbing Chicago ""buildings"" that are obviously just postcards or large photographs with real grasshoppers walking on them (the grasshoppers keep ""stepping off"" the building). The MST3K boys have great fun with this gag, doing a sketch where they have grasshoppers attack various postcards: Oldenberg IN, The Beatles, Earl Hines, etc. Graves manages to do very little in the movie except tell the military all the things they CAN'T do, instead of offering any real suggestions.
The wisecracks are great, as usual for this season of the show. It's especially fun listening to them make cracks about Peter Graves as host of ""Biography,"" Albert Glasser's hysterically overblown musical score, and the grasshoppers `touring' Chicago. (""Hey, we're in the famous Loop now, Harry!"") Between segements, Crow puts on a play based on Peter Graves's life at the University of Minnesota, all done in his ""Biography"" voice (""I'm Peter Graves, and I'm in the right class."")
As a dubious `bonus,' you can watch the un-cut version of the film on the flip side of the disc. Well, it's not that awful a film, but there isn't any reason to watch it without the MST3K commentary once you've experienced the comedy and laughs of this all-around fine episode. Recommended for newcomers and long-time fans alike. It's typical of the show during the excellent fifth season and shows Mike easing into his new role and the program format changing toward its more sharp-tongued and fast-moving later seasons.",1084320000,8,4291,5.184438040345821

What I mean by that is some people may love this ep, but I personally didn't find it very funny and the movie is so bad that the sub-average riffing doesn't save it. The best lines that Mike & the robots make are when they speak for a character and add a line to something a person says. Unfortunately, the feature's horrible pacing, slow dialogue scenes, and atrocious acting are not enough, and it seems like the writers took a break on this one. Of course, even weak MST3K is better than pretty much any other show, but I must say this is certainly my least favorite episode from season 5 and at times feels like a Season 1 episode (the riffing is sparse and not really funny). If you are a newcomer and would like to see this show at it's best, get either ""Manos: Hands of Fate"" or ""Red Zone Cuba"".",1082764800,3,862,4.294478527607362

186749,2,1566053986,How could anyone recommend a film that stinks? Easy. Its a funny film! And the best part is - its not supposed to be funny. My favorite scene is when Peter Graves introduces his lab assistant as the man who had the unfortunte accident working with radiation. And hes still there working with the same radio active stuff! I laugh out loud every time I see it. Its really bad. The quality of the DVD is the best I've seen to date. Image did a good job.

If you can name another B-movie as noteworthy for superimposed monsters, then you go right ahead and knock yourself out.

The plot is standard B-movie fare. A couple of wacky teenagers are out in the lovers' lane of a small town in central Illinois when the chirping of the insects gets a tad louder and then there is screaming and stuff. The state police discover not only the wrecked and bloody car, but the fact that the nearby town of Ludlow has been completely destroyed and there are no bodies. The next thing we know intrepid girl reporter Audrey Ames (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peggy-Castle/dp/B000X9PRCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peggy Castle</a>) is hot on the story about giant mutant grasshoppers courtesy of an Illinois State experimental farm. This is where Dr. Ed Wainwright (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Peter-Graves/dp/B001BN4WI6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Peter Graves</a>) has been experimenting with the use of radiation to grow giant tomatoes the size of basketballs and thereby feeding the world. The good doctor tells the reporter that things have going pretty well except for the fact that his partner Dr. Frank Johnson (Than Wyenn) is now deaf and mute because of accidental exposure to the radiation and that grasshoppers have been eating the tomatoes.

Well, gosh, darn it, Ed feels just terrible about everything when the giant grasshoppers eat his partner and defeat the U.S. army troops sent out to try and keep things under control. Fortunately, General Hanson (Morris Ankrum) lets Ed tag along as his scientific adviser (think of it as the mob of townspeople asking Dr. Frankenstein for advice). When the grasshoppers decide that the agricultural expanses of America's breadbasket are not as appealing as the skyscrapers of Chicago, General Hanson fears the end of the world, or at least the beginning of the end, and orders up an A-bomb to save the day. However, Ed, who knows a little something about the deleterious side effects of exposure to radiation, things nuking Chicago is a bad thing and has to come up with a better plan pretty darn quick.

Ed's solution is too good to give away and despite it being so laughable it is indicative that the group of screenwriters responsible for this film were trying to connect all the dots with something scientific. Once again, the science might be suspect, but you have to admit that the solution is a lot easier and cheaper to film than an exploding atomic bomb. ""Beginning of the End"" is another example of the fact that size is always important in one of B.I.G.'s movies, as well as extending the giant mutant monster trend from ants (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Them/dp/B000067FP3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Them!</a>"") to spiders (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tarantula/dp/6302763835/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tarantula</a>"") to grasshoppers (I know, they are really locust, but grasshoppers sounds funnier). The idea of having a giant swarm of mutant monsters overwhelming a small town, the U.S. army, and whatever is put in their way is compelling. But carrying it off requires the CGE technology that produced ""Starship Troopers"" and instead we have a movie that Steven Spielberg could have made in 1957 (i.e., when he was only 11 years old and making movies in his backyard with his friends).

Once again, my rating for ""Beginning of the End"" is based more on the entertainment value of the film rather than its aesthetic quality. How can you not enjoy superimposed grasshoppers or Peter Graves suggesting doubts about the nuclear destruction of a major American city? I would not say this is the best of Gordon's films; indeed, I am loath to actually pick one under those conditions. But I would contend that this is the one of his films that I would give ""must see"" status to for those who enjoy 1950s black & white science fiction monster movies.",1053043200,42,4886,5.9164305949008495
186751,5,1566053986,"UPDATE 8/18/2016: Hen's Tooth edition vs. Image edition: I finally broke down and ordered the Hen's Tooth reissue of this, partly to get the trailer and partly to see how the transfers compared. I had seen some comments to the effect that the transfers were identical, but I can firmly state that this is not the case. I cued up both discs and compared them side by side on my 60"" screen, and, in short, the Hen's Tooth edition has obviously been remastered and looks quite a bit better than the older Image release. The Image edition was misframed to start with, having a black bar on the left side, with the image running flush into the right side of the screen with no black bar, at approximately 1.66:1. The Hen's Tooth edition is also matted to 1.66:1 but is properly framed with a narrow black bar on both sides, and it also reveals slightly more image at the top and bottom of the frame, though there is no additional information revealed on the sides. Besides the improved framing, the Hen's Tooth transfer itself also looks more correct; it's darker in the opening night scene than the Image release, but that's because the Image disc is overly bright. The Image disc looks washed out in the daylight scenes, with weak mid-tones and watery blacks. The Hen's Tooth transfer is also sharper than the image disc, which exhibits some weird graininess (not film grain) due to the inferior transfer. All in all, switching back and forth between the two, the picture quality of the Hen's Tooth transfer is much more naturalistic and pleasing than the Image disc. The trailer runs 1:27 and was obviously taken from a VHS source (the copy of the trailer I have on a Sinister Cinema videotape runs 1:39 but otherwise looks about the same).

Bert I. Gordon's Beginning of the End always seems to get dumped on in science fiction movie books and magazines, but it's my second-favorite ""big bug"" movie (right after Tarantula) and, while clearly a low-budget effort, packs as much entertainment value as many higher-rated SF ""classics."" The film opens with a favorite 1950s SF cliche, necking teens getting munched by unseen monster (nearly identical to the pre-title sequence of Giant Gila Monster). Pretty soon cops are finding entire small towns deserted and demolished. Peggie Castle plays Audrey Ames, spunky gal reporter and former war correspondent investigating the mysterious devastation. Low-budget SF icons Thomas B. Henry (one of the great big noses of all time) and Morris Ankrum are both on hand as military officers, B.I.G. regular Hank (Green Acres' Fred Ziffel) Patterson puts in a cameo, and veteran voice artist Paul Frees (Mr. Limpet's Crusty the Crab, etc.) is heard a number of times (coming out of loudspeakers, helicopter radios, etc.)

The script, co-written by Fred Freibeger (Beast from 20,000 Fathoms), is generic B-monster pulp, and they occasionally resort to the low-budget moviemakers' crutch of describing events that would have been too costly to film. Peter Graves (Killers from Space, It Conquered the World, Mission: Impossible) and his deaf-mute assistant (who you just know is eventually going to be grasshopper lunch) have been working on developing giant crops (love those gigantic tomato and strawberry props) at the USDA Illinois experimental station. The crops have been consumed by locusts, causing them to grow to titanic proportions. The bulk of the movie is standard giant monster stuff: the army attacks; the `hoppers attack; Peter Graves goes to Washington and shows a 16mm film about locusts to Pentagon brass; the Illinois National Guard are overrun; chlordane is found ineffective (off-screen); Peoria, Pontiac, and Joliet, Illinois, are demolished (off-screen); and refugees pour into Chicago (off-screen again). A bathing woman in a towel is menaced by a giant locust (a standard B.I.G. device), a TV announcer advances the plot (another standard B.I.G. device), and a newspaper headline screams ""Chicago Next!"" Finally the U.S. military moves in and is again overrun by the `hoppers, who invade Chicago's South Side. When the military gives up and decides to drop an A-bomb on Chicago at dawn, Graves gets the brilliant idea to lure the `hoppers into Lake Michigan with a recording of their mating call, precipitating the wonderfully ludicrous finish that fans of this movie will remember fondly.

Apparently this was shot just after Amazing Colossal Man so the effects actually look quite a bit better than that movie and The Cyclops (forget King Dinosaur), and are accomplished through the typical rear-projection and travelling matte techniques, using live oversized Texas grasshoppers. True, the opticals are not as clean as in the bigger-budgeted Tarantula (matte lines and mismatched contrast are often evident), but if you want giant bugs and lots of `em, Beginning of the End delivers. The much-maligned shots of grasshoppers crawling on still photos of buildings are rescued somewhat here by the restored widescreen matting, preventing the insects from crawling off the edges of the photos, as seen in open-matte TV prints. Personally, I think Beginning's FX show a lot of ingenuity, especially considering the budget (the notorious ""photo crawling"" shots are often actually matted composites, not the rock-bottom cheese reviewers sometimes describe). Detractors should sit through Monster from Green Hell or Cosmic Monsters sometime. As pure an example of 1950s B-movie SF as exists, and a must-have for fans.

Although Rhino's MST3K DVD includes the uncut version of Beginning of the End, this Image edition is hands-down the one to buy if you just want the movie in fantastic shape and don't need the MST3K stuff. The print quality here (supposedly from the original camera negative) is excellent to pristine, with only some light speckling evident, handily demolishing Rhino's acceptable but inferior transfer. Jack Marta's cinematography looks great and it's finally matted to 1.66:1 as intended and anamorphically enhanced. There is a spare, generic but nicely done lobby card gallery, and audio commentary by Flora M. Gordon (Bert's ex-wife and frequent collaborator) and Susan (Bert's daughter) Gordon. Why the still-living Mr. B.I.G. chose not to participate is a mystery (is he perhaps sensitive about being picked on all these years?) The chat is moderated by actor/director Bruce Kimmel (First Nudie Musical, Creature Wasn't Nice). I'm not sure why since he seems generally unprepared and ill-informed (he refers to Bronson Canyon as Beechwood Canyon several times) and takes a few unnecessary swipes at MST3K. Flora and Susan provide some interesting background, although there are times where Flora can't remember incidents or wasn't involved, and at one point she claims that Universal's Incredible Shrinking Man was based on Bert's Attack of the Puppet People!!! All in all, a far higher caliber DVD set than guilty-pleasure fans of this flick could have dreamed would ever appear. Recommended.",1052524800,81,6970,5.1873889875666075

This offering from Best Brains offers an offering that's sure to offer your fair offering of grasshoppers.

186755,4,1566053986,"Turkey or treasure, there will always be a special place for this film in my heart, as it was the first sci-fi I was able to sit through without getting scared. Who could be scared of grasshoppers, whatever the size? They were my favorite insects, which made this movie all the more cool in my wild kid-dom.
That being established, I must concede that the MST3K treatment does this fractured effects fiasco proud, right from the relentless 5/4 ""march of the mutant locusts"" title theme, a fall-on-the-floor yuk-fest that lets up only during the rather lame commercial break intros that were left in. Poor Crow can't handle the vaporously fading opening credits and gets violently ill. The three can't get that marching theme out of their heads, but they sure aren't taken in by the California locale filming (""Guys, this is so NOT Illinois!""). During an interminable scene in which two armed guards are just staring at each other, the comment is ""Now here's an improv that really went nowhere"".  They poke fun of the hearing handicap of Frank, Peter Graves' ill-fated lab assistant.  The oscillator drone the scientists use to trick the bugs reminds them of Brian Eno. Like most MST3K installments, I can only remember about half the barbs because I was laughing so hard through the rest.
Funny thing is, after all these years, parts of the story are actually rather clever, and wrangling those live superimposed grasshoppers must have been no easy chore. And even if it was a postcard of a building the bugs were actually climbing, the effects crew did a good job of keeping their shadows off of the sky. And you gotta wonder how they created that noise ..... sounds like two strong men having an intense tug-of-war with some chicken wire fence, yanking it repeatedly. It's those little touches that make films like this a labor of love.
So it was an easy film to grow out of. The boys and droids of MST3K have given it a whole new life, and me an excuse to purchase the title with minimal embarassment. I appreciate that the original release (as seen on many a late night TV sleepover) is made available for the viewer who wants to make up his/her own jokes, even though the print is not as cleaned up as one would expect for a DVD re-release.

Only a child's imagination could ignore that ""The Building"" is a postcard, and that many shots show grasshoppers falling sideways or hanging in mid-air. Classic. Director Bert I. Gordon would go on to do better work - the wonderfully bad 'Food of the Gods' (1976), but the ""Wrigley sequence"" in 'Beginning of the End' says all that could be said about the man. The scene really is hysterical.
There. You're welcome. That's the funny part in this episode. Really the only part. And here's the problem: an MST3K episode lives and dies by pace - the actual movie can be silly/goofy/awful, but it's gotta have pace. If it doesn't, the jokes will get lost in the boredom. This is easily the dullest episode ever released on DVD, why others are raving loyal praise, I have no idea. You wanna hear the other good parts? I... don't remember.

(Chicago wisely declined comment.)
The sketches on the Satellite of Love are among the best ever done, giving us a glimpse of what Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank REALLY did while Mike and the 'bots watched the movie and Crowe's rendition of the life of Peter Graves.

It takes something special to make this movie palatable, and Mike and The Bots (M&TB) are it. What dedicated MSTie can't quote from memory Peter Graves' preachy final oration? (Well, I can't, for one. But I know it's there!)
One of the best things about the MST series was its unrelentingly positive worldview. Even in the midst of cheap and obvious movies like this one, M&TB riff their little hearts out and come out winners.

At times, I honestly thought I was going to pass out due to the sheer boredom that this film was giving off in waves. Every time I nearly collapsed, a joke or wisecrack from one of the MST3k crew would revive me, but it would have been a mercy to leave me unconscious. In case you haven't understood me, I'll state it more clearly: this movie is really dull, incredibly dull, extremely dull. Dull, dull, dull.
.
The effects are lousy, the acting abysmal and the script is horrible. Even the MST3k crew couldn't save this turkey, though they do have several good gags and funny put-downs. Take my advice and watch this in small segments. Watching it all at once could bore you to death. As big of a fan of MST3k as I am, I'd have to recommend a different episode of that series to watch. MST3k is at its best when the movie they are mocking is entertainingly bad in its own right. THE BEGINNING OF THE END has some painfully horrible parts, but they get repeated over and over again so much so that you're just sick to death of it. I fear that if I attempted to view this movie again I'd end up expiring the third or fourth time those insects start crawling around on a postcard of Chicago.",998784000,3,1355,4.338582677165355

Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara, and Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are just a few. Well I think you can add another pair to this list. ""Director"" Bert I. Gordon and MST3K.
I don't know why, but MST3K always turned it up a notch for a Bert I. Gordon flick. Bert I. always made them sharper and funnier. Here, MST3K takes a swing at Gordon's ludicrous giant grasshopper movie, Beginning of the End and jacks this hanging curve into the upper deck. As usual, Bert I. gives MST3K more than enough to work with. Cars start by themselves. Central Illinois looks like Arizona. And no one will be seated during the  terrifying grasshopper ""attack"" in which hundreds of normal-sized grasshoppers crawl over postcards of downtown Chicago.
I didn't notice a slow spot the whole time. Mike and the bots were hysterically funny from start to finish, including the side bits. And as seems to be usual for an MST3K DVD, the regular movie is also included here, in case you want to do some amateur MST3King. This would be a good one to try this at home with.

(the excellent giant ant movie of 1954), even to the extent of using similar camera angles in some scenes, and using a title that does not reveal the nature of the menace.  Unfortunately, giant grasshoppers simply do not seem as menacing as giant ants, and the special effects are very shoddy, consisting almost entirely of rear-projected real grasshoppers.  But it gets worse.  When the big attack on Chicago comes, we see several bugs crawling on a photograph of the Wrigley Building!!  Hardly convincing.  (One interesting footnote:  this is the only ""giant menace"" movie in which Chicago is the menaced city.)  Earlier in the film, the small town which the bugs have destroyed is represented by footage of A-bombed Hiroshima.  Apparently, giant grasshoppers eat buildings as well as people.  The awesome menace is ended when the bugs swarm en masse into Lake Michigan and drown.  (Resulting, one suspects, in an awfully messy and polluted Lake Michigan.)

They get out of the theatre to do an introduction and have various intermissions through the film (fortunately, since otherwise we'd go nuts too). They watch the bad films with us, and you can see them sitting at the bottom of the screen while they make rude remarks about it.
This episode features the classic SF concepts of Really Big Insects destroying cities and scientists who accidentally destroy civilisation by allowing their wonderous experiments to get out of hand. (Interestingly, no one is upset at the scientists for this, and one ends up being the hero of the film.)

The episode is quite fun to watch. There are many funny comments and events that happen on the film. The first major grasshopper is excellent. Despite being a ""cheesy"" movie, the acting is not bad, compared to other films in the MST3K series. The ""in between"" skits are also quite good.

America's finest fighting force (the Illinois National  Guard) is powerless against this giant hopping threat. Another 1957 monster  classic from infamous science fiction filmmaker Bert I. Gordon, the  undisputed master of movies about giant animals attacking California cities  masquerading as the midwest. Don't miss the riveting post-opening credits  scene: an apparently endless car-approaching sequence (Mike: ""Folks,  we'll start the movie as soon as our ride gets here.""), and the  incessant, earsplitting, marching-band music soundtrack. An early Mike  Nelson episode, it's a great example of classic MST3K: bad sci-fi flick,  hilarious riffing on the film by Mike and the bots, including a *seriously*  weird host segment where rubber grasshoppers attack postcards Mike just  happens to have lying around.

While investigating that something that of course she intuitively knows is related to radioactivity, she is naturally stonewalled by the great Sci-Fi military actors of the time, Gen. John Hanson (Morris Ankrum) and Col. Tom Sturgeon (Thomas Browne Henry.)

Whom can Audrey turn to for help? Who else dabbles in radiation? Yep it is entomologist Dr. Ed Wainwright (Peter Graves) with his deaf-mute sidekick Frank (Than Wyenn.) She admires his big uh... strawberries. He explains even though Frank was o.k. last year that radiation is harmless.

So what wiped out a local warehouse and the town of Ludlow?
