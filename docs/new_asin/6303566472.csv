686633,5,6303566472,"Have this excellent movie on VHS and held onto it tight, till finally came out in DVD format and now own two copies.  This may be a 1945 movie, but is wonderful, funny, touching, just plain good fun to watch.  The remake was a farce, but a person won't go wrong purchasing this entertaining ""Brewster's Millions"" with Dennis O'Keefee, Helen Walker and Eddie Rochester.",1371168000,,368,4.734375
686634,4,6303566472,"I saw this movie as a kid, it was great then and its better now, don't confuse this movie (Dennis O'Keefe) with the Richard Prior 2002 one. Most times the original is the better and this for sure is the better.
  Its about 3 GIs who were just out of the WW2 army and one has been notified that he has inherited money. Not just money, but millions with one catch, he must spend one million dollars within 3 months and not tell anyone why or having any assets when it is spent. Seems easy???? not so but hold on, you will laugh like you have never laughed before and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson will keep you laughing from beginning to end. I found myself waiting for Jack Benny to show up.",1369094400,,687,4.236641221374046
686635,4,6303566472,This is a very good comedy.  I saw it when I was around eight years old and watched it again being in my sixties. I lent it to several friends who are my age and they all enjoyed it as well.,1365811200,,190,3.6341463414634148
686636,5,6303566472,"This is a great old classic. If you are expecting the Richard Pryor version this is not it. If you like watching black and white and/or original versions rather than modern remakes then you'll like this movie. They changed the movie a lot when they made the remake. I like the classics so I liked this, the original, much better.",1363910400,4,329,4.5

686757,4,6303566472,"It was an entertaining novelty to see an older veersion of ""Brewsters Millions"", but I'll have to admit- I prefer the 1985 version with Richard Pryor and John Candy.  Dennis O'Keefe delivers much of the running dialogue at a frantic pace, and that distracts from the comedic aspect at times.",1469923200,,291,4.82

686761,4,6303566472,"Who would have ever thought that SPENDING money could be so troublesome?  Just when one wants to get rid of money, it keeps coming back.  But sometimes you have to do that in order to inherit even MORE money!  I've never seen a plot quite like this, and it was alot of fun, though you get caught up with the frustration of the main character, as he tries to spend more money - and can't tell anyone WHY he has to spend a million dollars in a certain length of time!",1466208000,,465,4.087912087912088

686825,4,6303566472,"I really liked this better than the remake that came later with Richard Prior. I thought the actor that played Brewster was perfect for the part. I felt sorry for him because the more he tried to spend, the more he made--which meant the more he would loose! I kept waiting for him to say ""heck with it all"" and tell his girlfriend what was going on so that he would not loose her. The only part I did not like was the very end because it kinda felt rushed a little. I would have loved to seen the reaction of all his friends when they found out exactly why Brewster had acted the way that he did. We were not even shown his girlfriend's reaction--so I felt it was a little rushed. But all in all I thought it was a nice light comedy.",1457481600,2,733,4.062068965517241

686827,5,6303566472,"I've seen three versions of this movie. The most recent - with Richard Pryor and John Candy - is, at best, a savage disappointment.

This version, from 1945, is easily the best version of Brewster's Millions. Dennis O'Keefe is absolutely spot-on manic hilarious.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1455321600,,282,5.2444444444444445

686829,4,6303566472,"Even though i am of Generation X I usually prefer the original versions of a story rather than the remake. This was not the time. I hate comparing the two, but what sticks with me in the movie is that he bought the cabs, he didn't rent them. Wouldn't that have been an asset? Even though he was smart enough to lease a few things, there were a few things he bought. They fixed a lot of that in the remake.(The stamp in the remake was brilliant) Although I usually  look beyond the racial components of a movie, It irks me that in the same sentence that he promised his friends promising futures , all he promised Jackson was that he could be a servant for the rest of his life. (Keep in mind Jackson was also a war veteran)  Then, in the same style of many films of that era, the African American offers to give all his money to his Caucasian boss.",1447632000,,848,4.164634146341464

686834,3,6303566472,Let this be just what it is. A mildly amusing little movie of which they did a remake and used several big names. Don't look for Richard Pryor or John Candy in this film. Don't expect any of the same twists or turns we saw in the altered story. Just sit back and enjoy this matinee of life in simpler times.,1429401600,,307,4.049180327868853
686855,4,6303566472,"Classic comedy at it's best.  The later version with Richard Pryor does not match the charm of gentle humor of the original.  As always, Dennis
O'Keefe is outstanding!  Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson is lively and highly amusing as well.  The film never misses a solid beat and sustains your interest throughout.  A real ""treasure to be enjoyed again and again as a man must spend one million dollars within a 30 day period to inherit the remainder of an eight million estate.

686860,5,6303566472,"There are several versions of this movie and this version was produced in 1945 is an absolute classic. Dennis O'Keefe as the lead character Monty Brewster has outperformed himself in this screwball comedy. The story is about a former serviceman Monty Brewster inherits eight million dollars from his wealthy uncle with a stipulation that he spend the first million in just two months, with no assets in his name, to qualify for the rest of inheritance, the seven million dollars. It becomes the sweetest gift just before his wedding, but it also stipulates that he keep this inheritence a secret for himself and not reveal to his friends and family. Desperate to spend, he starts businesses and makes intentionally bad investments. But things go awry as he begin earn wealth.

The movie is strongly supported by Helen Walker, Gail Patrick, June Havoc and Eddie Anderson. The jealousy of his fianc played by Helen Walker becomes a dominant factor when Monty starts attracting ladies like June Havoc and Gail Patrick with his charm and money. Allan Dwan has done a terrific job of directing the movie; it moves fast and the story is highly engaging. Another key feature of this movie is the family servant played by the black actor Eddie Anderson, who has many funny lines, works wonderfully with the rest of actors in the story.

The 1985 version starring Richard Pryor and John Candy is also great movie, released under the same title, but I like this 1945 version much better.",1405555200,2,1477,4.857142857142857
686861,4,6303566472,"Great era movie.  Original before Richard Pryer's version, taking place just after WWII.  Like this movie and want another one like it; check out Jimmy Stewart in 1950s ""The Jackpot""",1388016000,,182,5.033333333333333
686862,4,6303566472,as Usual it is an ok movie but the book is so much better.  I was shocked at the number of people I know who have never heard of the book or the movie.  Big thing is the moral or message of the story is the same.  overdoing will make you never want to do something again.,1382400000,,271,3.719298245614035
686863,4,6303566472,This was the original; Richard Pryor made a knockoff that did not have the speed or humor.  This was the good one.,1380672000,,114,4.181818181818182
686864,4,6303566472,The plot is already covered in most of the reviews so I won't waste time there.  O'Keefe and Walker make a great couple in this light comedy with great support work by mostly B actors and the great Gail Patrick.  As a fantasy film it clearly touches most of the problems and benefits of being thrust into having to spend money (with restrictions).  The pacing is good throughout and keeps your interest right up to the frantic conclusion.  Highly recommended.,1376352000,,459,4.7
7851028,4,6303566472,"I have seen both the Film Detective Restored Classics version and the Henstooth Video version. One would think that the newer transfer would be the better of the two---Henstooth released its version in 2013 and Film Detective came in 2016, but such is not the case here. The Henstooth version has the better quality hands down. The black-and-white contrast is almost perfect; a few white specks are throughout the film here and there, but nothing to distract from the picture. The audio is great. Unlike many public domain transfers, I don't hear a humming on the soundtrack nor do I have to turn my soundbar up to full volume to hear the dialogue. And last but not least, a little luxury that is usually not included with a public domain film is included---subtitles! All in all, if you are looking for a great transfer of a very funny and frantically enjoyable film, go with Henstooth Video!",1525219200,,893,4.730769230769231

only negative thing I can say is it seemed they rushed the ending. Wondering if they ran out of time and money?",1473033600,,283,4.339622641509434
