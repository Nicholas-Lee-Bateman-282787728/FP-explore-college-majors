8328566,5,B001O00MGC,"A great live recording by the greatest bluegrass/punk band... SLR is a true original, a true music lover can't possibly get enough of these guys, the only thing better then the DVD is seeing the trio live, rip K.R.",1454457600,,214,4.512820512820513
8328567,5,B001O00MGC,Incredible band. Kind of bittersweet since it was about 6 weeks before the guitar player died from cancer. A great show and well done DVD.,1418256000,,138,4.56
8328568,5,B001O00MGC,"Split Lip Rayfield is a great band.  Their studio albums are very solid and feature some fantastic acoustic picking, however, to really understand the music and personality of this group you need to see them live.  This DVD captures their final live show with the full 4-man line up.  Their guitar player would die of cancer just a few months after this DVD was recorded.  Everybody on stage and most of the people at the show are aware of the situation and that brings even more intensity and emotion to the performance.  As a person who owns all of their studio albums I can say the set list is fantastic.  Songs by all 4 members and some great numbers from their first four studio albums as well as a few classic songs that never made it on any of their studio stuff.  I own a lot of concert DVDs from all kinds of different bands and this one is probably my favorite.  The sound and picture quality are quite good.  I'm just happy the band was able to record a live DVD before Kirk passed away.  This band is still going strong as a trio but everybody should see them in their prime with Kirk at the helm and this DVD makes that possible.",1320105600,,1142,4.294392523364486
8328569,5,B001O00MGC,"I was very pleased to find this DVD, as I have bought a few Split Lip Rayfield CDs over the years and have had immense pleasure in listening to them.  Seeing them is better!  The sadness is knowing that Kurt isn't there any more, but to watch how happy he was to be making his music has a happy impact on this viewer.  Plus of course the music and playing is just great.  I am only too happy to recommend this DVD to like-minded music lovers.

This DVD is awesome, the video coverage is great the audio is awesome and the guys are tight in both harmonies and playing. Simply fantastic to see Kirk (RIP) and the boys rock as hard as they do. It's a solid couple hours of alt-country bluegrass that rocks so damn hard. Buy this DVD if you dig Split Lip at all, simply fantastic.",1261785600,,442,4.151162790697675
