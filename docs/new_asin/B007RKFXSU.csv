5108843,4,B007RKFXSU,"Its no accident that Micky Rooney, the hero of this comedy plays an Irish American duffer headed for Notre Dame. With America headed for war, filmakers produced this entertaining comedy to show Americans that not all Brits are snobs, and we've got more in common than what makes us different.  Though its dated, the movie works, and the story is engaging to the end.

Teenager Tim Dennis, son of a famous All American player for the Fighting Irish (the nickname is never mentioned in the film) is determined to follow in his late father's footsteps, when he learns that his wealthy mother has married an English gentleman. Tim and his sister are soon packed off to England, to join Mom, where Ronney is told that he's headed for Eton. Naturally, he's furious, but Tim agrees to give it a go for six months, once his new stepfather pulls strings to get him in.

Culture shock sets in early when Tim gets a look at the Eton coat and hat he'll have to wear. (""I look like a penguin!"") The system of underclassmen serving old ones shocks him. (it's not unlike the ones in many American prep schools at the time--or at military schools like West Point.).  He's a tough kid though and, as any viewer could predict, he makes major mistakes, then succeeds though applying his own brand of American spunk and using the same code of honor respected in both countries.  Naturally there's comedy here, the best of which comes from an excellent supporting cast. Young Peter Lawford plays Tim's nemesis, the heavy in the film.

This movie was created to entertain an America educated in American  public schools."" Presumably,  they did not pick up on how odd it was that Tim, whose wealthy mother indicates he was headed for an American prep school, sometimes sounds like one of the Bowry Boys.  Similarly, it's hard to understand how rough and ready Micky Rooney ended up with such a Waspy mother. In the 40s the likely feeder schools for Notre Dame would have been outstanding Catholic boys schools, but there's no indication that Tim is Catholic, when he is shown the family chapel on his stepfather's estate.

Similarly, anti-American prejudice, something that did and does occasionally arise, is treated more as a myth than a reality. Even Lawford, the villain who torments Tim, does so more because Tim rocks the boat, than because he is an American.

Though the closing credits promote War Bonds, the film seems to have been written before Pearl Harbor, as Tim is still headed for Notre Dame at the end of the movie, not the Army.

Though it is mostly tame, this film does have a  tough, emotional moment regarding the death of a horse.  I'm not sure I would recommend it for a three year old.

For most viewers, I would recommend it though. It's a good story, and a lot of fun.",1381622400,2,2771,4.638036809815951

I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but Mickey Rooney always entertains. Mickey can be overbearing and overact, and there are some silly scenes, but, overall, the movie is engaging and a lot of fun. Little sister, Juanita Quigley, is marvelous and steals every scene shes in. You won't be disappointed by watching this film. Give it a try.",1468108800,,485,4.855421686746988

8521374,2,B007RKFXSU,"This movie I give two stars because I like the older movies but this movie sort of presented conflicting values. On one side we see the traditional British values in dress, behavior and etiquette. Here we have two children from America who are insolent and overly aggressive. I hate to say this is a bad movie but I can't help but feel, why present such bombastic behavior from American kids. I couldn't relate to that behavior and would not recommend this movie to people who are trying to raise kids to be respectful, polite and law abiding.",1423699200,,543,4.608247422680412
