641611,5,6303394345,"The Pagemaster is a rare movie, that has both live action and animation. It's about a boy that hates heights (and who couldn't blame him). And is also a rare live action movie that has a G rating. The live action part of the movie was directed by Joe Johnston. And the animation part of the movie was directed by Maurice Hunt. As the movie opens, Ricard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) is sent to get some nails for the tree house his father is bulding in a tree, Richard refuses to climb. But it starts to rain. So Richard takes shelter in a library, where a man (Christopher Lloyd) who claims that he has a talent for what people need. He ends up with a library card, and asks the man where the phone is. Christopher Lloyd also voices the title character. And when paint starts to fall from a picture of the Pagemaster, Richard tries to find the exit, but can't, and is turned into a cartoon character, and is visited by the Pagemaster, who tells him that he has to get to the exit to get back to a human character, which he is still in the library.",1036713600,2,1043,4.2462311557788945
641612,5,6303394345,"Great ""G"" fantasty for those who aren't quite ready(old enough or mature enough) for all the Harry Pottery excitement. The littlest viewers can watch this flick in safety without mom having to worry about ""what gave it that PG-13 rating anyway"". Yes, the older ones might find it a bit dull but the young ones will eat it up and McCauley Culkin is always a favorite!",1029628800,2,366,4.5606060606060606
641613,5,6303394345,"My kids loved this movie and enjoyed it very much.  It's about a kid who won't attempt most anything that a child does just for fun, just because statistics say the danger levels.
Something as simple as going to the store or climbing a ladder up to a tree house scare him very much.  Then he slips & suffers a fall inside the library and looses conciousness, where he travels to dreamland and converts to an animation. Then he has to survive very dangerous situations; making him realize that he doesn't have to be afraid to try new things.  Get this movie your kids will love it, and you as a parent will enjoy watching along with them.  It will bring you back to childhood :)",1028764800,12,677,4.349206349206349
641614,5,6303394345,"I am rating this a good family movie, because my girls loved this movie alot! They saw it on tv a few times, and I had to buy it for them. It about reading and magical lands and imagination, which is what kids should be all about. I thought it was cute,but Im an adult and this is a kids movie, but my daughters thought it was great! I think your kids won't be disappointed.",1025827200,3,374,4.0
641615,5,6303394345,"This movie is great especially for kids with vivd imaginations. It takes them from the real world to the world of fantasy, adventure and intimidation. It leaves a great message for the kids to think about. I have probably bought it three times over in rentals at our local video store before I bought it.",1025049600,,304,4.545454545454546
641616,3,6303394345,"When this film came out ('94)it seemed like a step backwards. Other studios were doing some amazing things with their animation (Aladdin, My Neigbour Totoro) and this film looked as if it had been sitting on the shelf for a decade. It did boast some early CGA, but it's so simple that it's hardly distinguishable as such. Some of the scenes seem almost forced and Leonard Nimoy's role is overbilled just as Patrick Stewart's role of Adventure is underbilled. I also felt that Whoopie Goldberg seemed miscast as the voice of Fantasy. It is fairly obvious that this film suffered from the Hollywood hype machine and would have been better if it hadn't been developed as a marketing tool.
Having said that, it is still an amusing film and a worth while watch, especially for those who have seen everything else. At times it even seems a little reminicent of The Phantom Tollbooth.
Just don't expect much from it.",1016582400,,909,4.723270440251572
641617,5,6303394345,"A very prodigious story, but there are very little cons about it. Older kids like me may think it's pretty pathetic but some of us still have the spirit of a young child! I love books and I'm glad that more people would  start to pick up a book and read for an hour because of this video. There's  a very important lesson in this, also. It means to take a chance and don't  be afraid. As the Pagemaster said when the boy andt he books were escpaing  My. Hyde's castle, ""Reach deep inside of you and seize the  courage"".",961459200,,519,4.15
641618,2,6303394345,"Perhaps young children watch with happiness, but this animated feature is pure blandness. Storyline: a psychotic child who has no hobbies and is obscessed with statistics of every sort of accident (he rides a bicycle  with blinkers, a protective shield, and a loud beeper). He always wears  several helmets and is afraid of heights. He is so completely pathetic that  no one can possibly sympathize with him. Next, he gets into a giant mystic  library in the middle of the storm, totally dark and forgotten, where a  mystic librarian (Frank Lloyd) hands him a library card, a ticket to  adventure. Soon the paint collapses and he is swept into the cartoon  version of the library and the books in it, assisted by three book pals -  Fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg), a pirate Adventure (I'm quite sure his voice is  provided by Patrick Stewart), and Horror (I can't quite tell who that is).  Their entire adventure to the exit sign is so lifeless and dull, perhaps  due to the poorly-done script and some pathetic book interpretations, that  even the spooky glowing-green smoke in the visuals does not save it.
I  found the Pagemaster to be a spectacular drag. Don't watch it, please.",951264000,3,1176,4.82
641669,3,6303394345,My son and husband LOVE the book so we bought the movie after they finished reading it.

641677,5,6303394345,"I'm a sucker for animation and I somehow missed this film growing up. I bought it after a friend of mine mentioned it to me and we bought it and played it on amazon video that afternoon (I'll never complain about the instant gratification with finding most movies these days). I love all the literary references made throughout the film. Definitely a kids movie, but one I will look forward to sharing with my own kids someday.",1515369600,,427,4.558441558441558

The voice of Scooby Doo is Horror? It holds up. I'm nearly 30 and still in love with this movie. It's worth watching. It's worth showing to your kids, and maybe it'll make you wanna visit a library soon.",1511222400,,376,4.164383561643835

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Richard Tyler [Macaulay Culkin] is a child with an overactive imagination... of the wrong kind. He's obsessed with accidents and injury statistics, and as a result he's afraid to do just about anything other than cower in his room, which is plastered with warning posters of all kinds. Then one day while out on his bicycle, he's caught in a sudden downpour and takes shelter in a nearby building, which happens to be the library. To the chagrin of the librarian, he's uninterested in the books that line the shelves, until a touch of magic sends him into the world of the books themselves. Befriended by a swashbuckling novel named Adventure [Patrick Stewart], and he begins a voyage that will call on him to face his own fears and discover inner strength.

The Pagemaster is mostly an animated feature, framed by live-action sections. I enjoyed the style of the hand-drawn animations, which are fairly simple without being simplistic. Each of the three main book characters, Adventure [Patrick Stewart], Fantasy [Whoopi Goldberg], and Horror [Frank Welker], has a highly individual and creative appearance that matches perfectly the way the voices are done. The voices are, in fact, uniformly excellent, which shouldn't come as a surprise given the slate of actors assembled: apart from Patrick Stewart and Whoopi Goldberg, we also get Leonard Nimoy and Christopher Lloyd in supporting parts.

However, after watching this film, I have come to the conclusion that Macaulay Culkin may be famous, but he is a lousy actor. Or, at any rate with his other films, but this time he is quite good for a change in The Pagemaster and with his live-action performance characterised by slightly wooden facial expressions and unconvincing body language. This became apparent to me at the point in The Pagemaster when the film switches to animation: I suddenly realised that the animated character of Richard Tyler was doing a significantly better job of acting than the live Macaulay Culkin. Not good. Fortunately, the animated portion takes up most of the film, and Macaulay Culkin does an adequate job of providing the voice for the cartoon boy.

It's hard to criticise a film that takes as its premise ""reading is good""... but the truth be told, I really don't think that The Pagemaster does much with that premise. Look at it this way: if an alien visitor came to the planet Earth, saw this film without some cultural explanations (we'll assume that our hypothetical alien speaks English) it would conclude that ""books"" are rectangular-shaped cuddle toys. Book-shaped objects are found throughout the film's scenes, and of course several of the main characters are, literally, books, but there are no scenes anywhere that involve actually reading these books. As I said, this may seem like splitting hairs unnecessarily, but it seems to me that The Pagemaster should have and easily could have gone just a step further in embracing its theme.

At only 75 minutes long, The Pagemaster is a really good length for its main target audience of children, and the story keeps moving along at a very lively pace that should keep them interested more than usual. I don't think there's a whole lot of substance for the adult viewer, but it's moderately entertaining at least to keep the adult audience interested. Readers who enjoy the works of Robert Louis Stevenson in particular will be tickled to see the number of references or actual story elements drawn from his books.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Pagemaster is presented on Blu-ray courtesy of Fox Searchlight with a beautiful 1080p encoded image transfer and in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio. This is a solid if just slightly underwhelming looking transfer that benefits from elements with only very minor damage. Balancing that is just slightly tepid looking colour, though perhaps ironically the few CGI elements seem to have weathered the storm of time better than some of the traditionally drawn cell animation. There's a completely natural layer of grain in evidence here and if the transfer looks slightly soft a lot of the time, it's not necessarily a distraction, especially in the longer animated section, where things look kind of ""old school"" anyway. Line detail remains reasonably sharp in this long section and colours, while not quite as vivid as some may hope, are nicely saturated and certainly very varied. As with the animated sequence, the live action bookending moments look just slightly soft, but feature are good detail in close-ups and accurate, nicely saturated colours.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The Pagemaster sounds brilliant in its 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround mix and is nicely immersive, though it's perhaps just slightly less rambunctious than some might expect from a fantasy film like this one. Things get off to a good start in the storm sequence, when the roar of thunder gives the low end a real workout and the pelt of rain and hail fills the surrounds. Once the animated section takes over, there are some great sound effects, including some spooky moments in the graveyard leading up to Jekyll's house, the nice sea sequence which find Richie chasing Moby Dick, and the fun treasure hunting sequence with Long John Silver. The two featured songs nicely fill the surround channels as well. The mix here is a bit on the noisy side at times, and unfortunately the tendency is to place all the dialogue in the front channels, where it only sounds more crowded, especially when characters are talking over each other. That said, fidelity is excellent and dynamic range is very wide.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Exclusive Behind-The-Scenes Documentary [1994] [480i] [23:10] This is what I assume must have been a half hour television special, hosted by Christopher Lloyd. There are some decent interviews here and a look at the voice recording and storyboarding process. There's also a brief look at the CGI elements (crikey folks, you wait until you get a look at the old style CRT monitor!).

Music Video: Dream Away [1994] [480i] [4:47] This is a song recorded by Babyface and Lisa Stansfield, of early-'90s mega-hit ""All Around the World"" fame, and recorded exclusively for the 1994 animated film, The Pagemaster. It was written by Diane Warren and produced by David Foster. Is it any good, well Ill you be the judge of that.

Theatrical Trailers: No. 1 Theatrical Trailer [480i] [1:04] and No. 2 Theatrical Trailer [480i] [1:02]

Finally, The Pagemaster is technically a film that is to me an unqualified triumph. While the live action special effects are impressive, the animation appears somewhat rushed. It's certainly not the worst to have graced the big screen in the past few years (that distinction probably goes to FernGully), but certain sequences, most notably those involving The Pagemaster who resembles Gandalf from the animated The Hobbit looked unfinished. On the other hand, the fire-breathing dragon is suitably imposing and menacing. The characters of Fantasy, Adventure and Horror are wonderfully acted and supplied with some cheeky repartee by producer-writer David Kirschner. ""How do you like to curl up with a good book?"" takes on an altogether different meaning when Adventure suggests it to Fantasy. The animation is not up to the standards set by Disney's Beauty and the Beast, but it's cheery and comical enough to keep the little ones interested. Despite a lot of negative reviews towards this film, I personally think it is totally brilliant and enjoyable romp, despite the fact that I have never been a great fan of this precocious Macaulay Culkin and especially his previous ghastly films, but this one hits the mark 100% and ever since I had this on a Region 1 DVD, I have enjoyed this type of concept of live action combined with animation and to now have it on the Blu-ray format, brings this film to even greater heights of enjoyment and I know with each viewing I will love this film even more and that is why I am so pleased to add this to my ever increasing Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

picture:
great remastering. I'm sure they could have fixed some issues, such as bland color that appears in random parts of the animated portion of the film. Sometimes, picture would seem incredibly vivid and beautiful. Other times, color just seemed a tad too dark or lifeless. Other than that, picture was pretty clear. lines seemed crisp. it's an older, lesser known film so i wouldn't expect it to be amazing to look at, from a technical standpoint. still, it's better than the DVD (or older versions, for that matter).

audio:
surprisingly bombastic. it's great. the amount of sound coming from the surround channels is highly immersive, it's exactly what an  adventure film needs to sound like. sound also seems well-balanced throughout, with voices always being audible. all in all, it's great.

overall:

It was an attempt to encourage children to read more, which is a nobel cause. Like Jackie Draper in Puff the Magic Dragon, Richard Tyler goes on a journey & learns to overcome his fears & obstacles. WIth the movie encouraging reading & Richard Tyler learning to overcome all fears & obstacles I can definitely recommend it for kids, but the adults may not be too interested.",1367366400,,604,4.260869565217392

This is such a great idea for a film but there's one major problem: the kid is already a bookworm! He babbles on about statistics in the first 20 minutes which means he would have to had READ all of those statistics in a book! Why would you encourage a bookworm to read even more? That's like telling a drug addict to do more drugs! This movie would have worked better if they had the kid be addicted to video games, TV, sports, or anything NOT related to reading.

Also, the movie has no structure, the characters are generic, the literary aspects are just glanced over, and it's just a bore. This is such a great idea for a movie, but there's not much effort. Kids deserve stories that have real effort and imagination.",1306800000,2,883,4.25

During a storm, he seeks refuge at a library. He is soon brought into the world of the Pagemaster who gives him 3 tests; Adventure, Horror, and Fantasy. With the help of three books, he must face monsters, pirates, haunted houses, and dragons if he wants to make it to the 'Exit' sign.

The kid is nothing more then a walking cardboard cut-out. The book puns are painful to listin to and just as bad as the ice puns from Mr. Freeze from Batman & Robin. The Books themselfs are infuriating & more cartoony then have to be. Even The Dragon is boring and it barely moves but worst of all,it eats books...BOOKS!!! What kind of dragon eats books? Overall,the only thing this film teaches me is that movies can be just as boring as books. The name of the film itself sounds like a fake award they give at a library.  I give this film a 2 out of 10.",1285632000,,719,4.135714285714286
642852,5,6303394345,"For me this is one of those films that every time it's suggested as a film to view I don't initially want to watch because I think it will be cheesy but then end up enjoying a lot.

The story is about a very cautious young boy who is afraid of just about everything he comes in contact with. His father, who wants both to spend some time with his son and help him get over his fear, is building him a tree house. His dad sends him out to buy more nails for said tree house, but Richard (the boy) gets caught in the middle of a rain storm on the way and runs into the nearest building for shelter, and this building happens to be a library. When he enters the library he is bombarded by a very passionate librarian who is more than willing to help him find any number of stories, but Richard is just looking for a telephone and goes on his way to find it. As he is walking through the stacks he comes across a huge mural on the ceiling of a rotunda. As he's admiring this mural the paint starts to melt off the ceiling and drop onto the floor, turning everything it touches into a cartoon. Richard of course runs away and this paint chases him until both he and the entire library have been turned into a cartoon. He meets up with three books, Adventure, Fantasy, and Horror, and with their help, face three challenges (found within some classic books from each genre) as they make their way to the exit sign.

This plot of this movie sounds so cheesy, like one of those direct to film movies designed to make a quick buck, but instead it's one of those hidden gems that encourage imagination and self- confidence. Christopher Lloyd plays the librarian as well as The Pagemaster, and I think he was one of the best actors for the job. He speaks with a mixture of both a hushed and an explosive passion that could make you see the magic in a wet dish towel and draws you in so completely to the plot. It inspires both reading and imagination and  is a fast paced adventure, to be enjoyed by young and old.",1284076800,,2003,4.2109375
642853,5,6303394345,I love this movie because it refers to classic books that everyone should know. It is also great the way it starts out in real life then makes the transition to cartoon form. I think it is a must have movie.,1282435200,,207,4.073170731707317

642857,4,6303394345,"Nine-year-old Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) is, not to put too fine a point on it, a coward.  He's afraid of secondhand smoke, electric shock, natural disaster, and the possibility of any accident no matter how small.  His bicycle is equipped with big headlights, a windshield, a beeper, and a visibility pennant, and when he ventures out on it he wears a long-sleeved jacket, helmet, goggles, and reflective vest.  He won't play Little League for fear of being beaned on the head by a ball, and he won't go up into the treehouse his father (Ed Begley, Jr.) is building for him because ""seven per cent of all household accidents involve ladders.""  Surprisingly for a kid who's memorized every statistic related to injuries and danger, he doesn't have a library card, and when a thunderstorm drives him into the local library for shelter, he's amazed by its possibilities and by the mural on the central dome.  A bump on the head sends him into a universe of ""illustrations"" where he meets the Pagemaster (Christopher Lloyd, who also plays Mr. Dewey, the librarian) and is sent on a quest through the land of books to overcome evil, find his own courage, and face his fears, with the help of a trio of animated volumes, bluff piratical Adventure (Patrick Stewart), jive-talking Fantasy (Whoopi Goldberg), and Horror (Frank Walker), who looks like a cross between Igor and the Frankenstein Monster and, like Richard, is afraid of just about everything.

Macaulay Culkin plays the character of a boy who is afraid to do anything because ""statistics"" over-shadow his life.

He, along with his talking-book friends, seeks the library exit to escape dragons, pirates and many other adventures perfect for youth.

It is the one-liners and comments related to classic stories that may slip unnoticed by the young, but adds punch and laugh-out-loud fun for older youth and adults. An additional 5 stars for the ending which teaches about facing fears.

We liked the fact that it was done in half animation and half real actors. That was fun and cool for my 4 yr old. He likes Macaulay Culkin also so that was a bonus. Christopher Lloyd is in it briefly here and there but not a lot. He plays the librarian and the voice of the animated Page Master. Lots of stars lend their voices to this movie which adds to its appeal. The movie is not too long either which helps with the younger children. Those are the positive things I have to say about the movie. The negative things I have to say are that it was slow in parts and it was tough keeping my active sons attention for the duration. He would become distracted during some of the movie and rarely watched it to the end. No, he does not have ADHD...lol. Also, if you are going into the movie thinking the animation is high quality, like computer type animation, you will be disappointed. It is just normal animation done with ink and paper (so to speak). It is a good little movie though and it has a fun storyline and a happy ending with a positive message.

The only part I could distinctly remember was the change for real life to animation.  I remember loving the entire film and parts of the adventure.

In order to get to the exit sign, Culkin must brave all three genres, where he meets Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (Leonard Nimoy); Long John Silver (George Hearn); and a firebreathing dragon.

642946,4,6303394345,"This is the first movie I remember seeing as a kid.  I LOVED it.  It was my favorite.  Then, I didn't get to see it again for several years (stupid Blockbuster!)  When I finally saw it again, I STILL liked it.  I like it as I write this very day.  The music is good (the background music behind the movie that nobody really conciously listens to, but helps the mood anyway).  The animation's good, too.  And I ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! (How often does that happen?)  See, what happens a lot of the time, is that people blame colors they don't like, or designs  that are annoying, or WHATEVER on the animation.  But it isn't the animation's fault!  The way the thing on-screen MOVES is the only thing the animators do, mostly.  So, if you really want to criticize the animation, look at how they MOVE, not what they look like. Do you see?

  I think that, really, most of the reason that this is one of my favorite movies is that it is about BOOKS.  When I was little, my dad read me ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" and ""The Hobbit""; things like that.  So, naturally, I loved books and stories.  This is practically the only movie I've seen that encourages reading so much while still being sincere.  It's obvious that the filmmakers themselves (or at least, a lot of the people working on it) actually like to read.  THAT'S really why I like the Pagemaster.

...in terms of the actors and energy devoted to a potentially exciting idea, spoiled by lack of true imagination on the part of the writers, producers, and directors of this movie.  When anticipating theatrical release, the kids in the family were excited by the trailers, but they were excruciatingly bored by the film itself, which proved to be unimaginative, uninspired, and without the sort of spark to be expected of the collection of voice and acting talents participating therein.
And I could determine in '94 why the movie was bound to suck.  Note that the three genres of fiction instantiated in *The Pagemaster* were:
(1) Fantasy
(2) Adventure
(3) Horror
Not a whiff of Science Fiction, kiddies.  Of course.  Proverbs 29:18 all over the place (""Without a vision, the people perish"").  The mark of the mundanes is all over this movie.  Ostensible credits notwithstanding, if there was a genuine science fiction fan involved in the production of *The Pagemaster*, he was kept drugged and trussed up in a trunk somewhere on the set so he couldn't interfere with the process of turning perfectly good ingredients like these into a flat, uninteresting, drooling dollop of witlessness.
Beware the mark of the mundanes, my people!  In this as in everything else in life, they are walking Black Holes of vapidness, guaranteeing in every spoiled celluloid square of *The Pagemaster* an overwhelming dose of major suckage.
