8304996,3,B001GCVJTW,"Where to begin.  It was a cold winters night.  I settled in, three shots of store brand whiskey down, a hunger for learning the secret began growing in the deepest depths of my soul.  The Sensual Secret consumes you, not unlike a Ron Popeil infomercial entraps you after a long night of huffing fumes of your favorite off brand paint thinning product.  Let me tell you...THE SECRET IS REAL, AND BOY IS IT SENSUAL.
  So there I was.  Candles lit, an Engelbert Humperdinck record spinning on the RCA, and nothing but my sexuality to explore.  The Flesh Light was warmed by the fire...I was ready to go!  Not unlike my teenage years, watching reruns of the Golden Girls, I found myself overcome with waves of uncontrolled erotic titillation.  The Director masterfully crafts a hardcore softcore experience that's both educational and sexually gratifying.  I could feel the secret ""penetrating"" my ethereal inner sensuality with a secret that will last with me to my dying day.  I recommend this film for anyone traveling to Thailand (or Laos).  Let the secret be your guide, your companion, and your spiritual inspiration.
  As I woke up the next day, dehydrated, with a sense of promise and wonder, I realized that I was imparted with a secret...of a sensual variety.",1326412800,2,1265,4.845794392523365

I felt that the camera quality was acceptable for being shot on DV bowever it didn't take away from my movie experiance, it is obviously a low budget film but if produced in a better enviroment I would love to see it again. All in all I love to show it to my friends.",1326412800,3,387,4.173333333333333
8304998,1,B001GCVJTW,I thought this might actually contain a secret and provide new knowledge.  It had neither.  In addition the prduction was poor.,1225584000,,127,5.0
