2480904,5,B000E1MXZ0,"I eagerly anticipated this series, and installed HDTV in part because of it. Considering the limits of public TV (you cannot have battles involving thousands of extras and there are few if any F&I War reenactors, it is superb.

I know something about the production quality, and the producer took extraordinary steps to achieve authenticity, down to the most minor details of the costumes. There will always be quibbles (see other posts) but there is no more accurate depiction. And you simply cannot take your eyes off of the glorious HD picture!",1154476800,20,547,4.945652173913044
2480905,4,B000E1MXZ0,"This long-awaited DVD on the French and Indian War is very good in some respects, but there are some serious setbacks. I don't think it delivers or lives up to what I expected. It's the first mini-series on the entire French and Indian War. There are other videos/DVDs on parts of the war (see my reviews of _When the Forest Ran Red_ and _George Washington's First War_), but this is the first that attacks the whole war. However, I never felt like the series was tied together very well.  It just seemed that I was watching four separate DVDs that were somehow related.  I never got a sense of the entire war.  In all, I felt like I was watching the above-mentioned DVDs again.  Second, it's interesting to watch, as there are very well-done reenactments.  It's almost like watching a movie. However, many of the scenes are quite intense and violent. Some scenes (there is even a disclaimer at the beginning of each DVD) are not appropriate for young children. Yes, war is violent, but some of the scenes seemed to be included for shock value.

As far as the content goes, I have many issues.  Grant's raid on Fort Duquesne is not mentioned. The fall of Frontenac and Louisbourg are given only cursory treatment, which is surprising after the very detailed treatments of Braddock's defeat, Washington's early battles, and the fall of Fort William Henry.  The massacre after William Henry gets a lot of time and the DVD tries to downplay the whole incident by stating that not many people were actually killed with respect to the number reportedly killed.  I'm not sure why so much time is devoted to this (certainly because of the Last of the Mohicans movies).  But it's really not an important episode to the entire war--it should be a footnote.

The role and portrayal of the Indians is almost unbelievable. It starts off with the 'happy Indian' idea, ""Dozens of Indian nations coexist in Eastern North America.""  There is no mention of the discord among the various tribes.  Many tribes suffered greatly at the hands of the Iroquois and wanted to throw off their yoke of oppression. Tribes sometimes aligned themselves with one side based on whom their enemies sided with. Another claim is almost stupid, ""Captives often had less to fear than they thought."" One captive is shown running a gauntlet; but the gauntlet is shown as being a very kind thing. Would that the hazing I got in highschool would have been so tame! The claim is made that the Indians sided with the French because the French were less likely to take the land from them (It's the old ""French traders vs. English settlers"" idea).  This claim is later contradicted, ""Without gifts, the Indians will abandon the French."" This statement really makes the Indians look like mercenaries who sell their souls for a few trinkets.  Unlikely. The Indians were not so stupid--they jumped ship because the English started winning and they wanted to be on the winning side.  The final claim about the Indians is just too much, ""The support of the Indian nations is necessary for ultimate victory.""  This is simply not true.  In the early stages of the war, every betting man would have put his money on the French. The English were so inept it stupifies the imagination.  However, by 1759, the English had shipped the largest army North America had ever seen and turned this into a European-style war.  The 'little war' with small bands guided by Indian scouts and allies was a thing of the past.  The frontier was simply a sideshow for the big battles of the North.  Quebec, the real nail in the coffin for the French, was a classic European-style battle. The Indians by this time had become nearly irrelevant (consider their treatment by the English after the war which led to Pontiac's Rebellion).  The West was nearly forgotten by this time.  Unfortunately, the set gives much more time to the early West and treats the later battles in the North only as a nuisance that must be given some coverage.

My final criticism: this set really is the story of George Washington, not about the war itself. It seems like a retelling of the other two DVDs I mentioned--that's not bad, but not much is new.

Well, is there anything that really stands out in this set? Yes, the section on the after war years leading up to the Revolution is fantastic. I can't say enough good about it.  It really underscores the differences in goals between the British and Americans.  The Americans wanted land and the British, well, I don't think they really knew what they wanted.  The Break seems almost inevitalbe.  This part is very well done.

Is this set worth watching? Yes, but just keep in mind that it's a bit unbalanced and has some problems.",1151280000,70,4691,4.7050183598531214
2480906,5,B000E1MXZ0,"I saw this delightful series when it was on PBS. It basicly explains the conflict prior to the American revolution which pretty much set the stage for it both political and militery.

Extremely well done. Well narrated.

Admittedly it has flaws.

It makes the Actions against the Akadians look like Ethnic cleansing. Ommitting the reasons that though the Akadians were refusing to do business with the British they were supplying the French at Louisbourg and some were found under French arms. If you were there you too might side with the British. It also ommitts the actions of Robert Rogers. Just as it leaves out the awful dungeons of Quebec where many english and colonial captives suffered and died. It also has a number of Trival points, Mary Jemison was in her teens not thirty something as one critic pointed out to me.

But overall it does good coverage. It certainly isn't PC in that it shows the attrocities perpetrated upon the colonials by the French native allies and that the French paid money for english scalps and that their reason for purchasing live captives was not humanitarian but necitated by their need for labor.

Definately a must for anyone interested in studying the period.",1146700800,15,1204,4.853658536585366
2480907,4,B000E1MXZ0,"""The War that Made America"" is an overview of most of the major events, and the people involved in them, of the French and Indian War.  It's sort of documentary/miniseries hybrid.  Like a documentary, it's narrated by an actor- Graham Greene, occasionally shows paintings and drawings from the era, and presents maps to highlight where the historical events took place.  However, unlike most documentaries, there are no historians discussing the subject or modern scenes of areas where the battles took place.  Instead, the film attempts to bring the main events of the war to life by ""re-enacting"" them through the use of actors.  I'm hestitant to use the word ""re-enactment"" to describe the live-action scenes because that conjures up images of middle-aged, overweight folks waddling about in period costumes and ""dying"" melodramatically for the camera.  The ""War that Made America,"" although obviously constrained by a low budget, appeared to have made attempts to to avoid the image of ""old guys playing army"" that unfortunately attaches to most documentaries that rely heavily on the services of amateur historical enthusiasts.  The live action scenes are fairly subdued and I didn't notice any 300lb fifty-year old privates or corporals.

For its historical viewpoints, the documentary appears to have relied heavily upon the work of historian Fred Anderson- the author of the ""Crucible of War"" which is a terrific book on the Seven Years War.  Thus, just as Anderson portrayed in his book, the American Indian tribes are shown as serious political players in the struggle and not just peripheral allies as they are usually portrayed by other historians.  Further, since Anderson thinks that the guerilla warfare of expertise of American ranger outfits is nothing more than a myth, Robert Rogers and his rangers are not even mentioned which may surprise some people.  However, the film does avoid one of Anderson's more loopy beliefs- James Wolfe was suicidal and that battle of the Plains of Abraham was simply a way for him to kill himself.

The documentary focuses on most of the famous events of the war- the attack on Jumonville's glen, the battles of Fort Necessity, Monogahela, the Bloody Morning Scout and Lake George, Fort William Henry, Ticonderoga, and the Plains of Abraham.  It also discusses the problems that the British high command had with the colonial assemblies (something Anderson focused heavily on in his book).  Near the end, it show some of the events of Pontiac's uprising.  Also, the film constantly reminds the viewer that the French and Indian War is crucial to understanding why the American Revolution occured.

That link between the French and Indian War and the American Revolution is mostly demonstrated by the film's portrayal of the key role that young George Washington played in the F&I war and how it shaped his development as a man and as a commander.  The role of George Washington is nicely played by Larry Nehring- a Cleveland stage actor who has Washington's imposing height and auburn hair. (Although he's a little too old to be playing a man who was just in early 20's when most of the events of the film take place.  The film also has an incredibly overaged ""Mary Jemison.)

The film is fairly even handed.  It does not pretend that the Indians were not responsible for atrocities such as the Fort William Henry massacre or for what Shawnee raiders did to the Jemison family.  Thus, it's not as ""PC"" as some have complained here especially in light of the fact that there are ""historians"" out there who have attempted to whitewash every Indian atrocity.

Overall, this was a very nicely done documentary on a fascinating subject.  Yes, it had a public TV documentary budget and looks it, but it does appear that the producers tried hard to make every cent count.  It provides a nice overview for people not really familiar with this period of history.  It probably going to be shown in a lot of schools.",1141344000,101,3956,4.966616084977238
2480908,5,B000E1MXZ0,This is the best documentary ever made on the subject - by far.,1139961600,4,63,3.923076923076923
2480909,3,B000E1MXZ0,"Like many western Pennsylvania history buffs, I had been really looking forward to this much-heralded PBS program that was produced by Pittsburgh's WQED.  However, I must say now that I was somewhat dissapointed.  On the positive side, I believe that overall this film did a fair job of explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian war.  In particular, its emphasis on the Indians' point of view was somewhat new and interesting, although it certainly was at time over-emphasized. Also on the positive side, the blend of narrative and action scenes was well done and came accross somewhat better than many of these typical documentaries made up of ""experts"" interviews and picture stills (a la Ken Burns).  On the negative side, I share many of the criticisms of the scathing review by ""The Highlander"", although he too does not have all of his facts straight when he says for example that William Pitt (The Elder) was NOT the British Prime Minister durin the war, although he was, first from 1757 to 1761 and again from 1766 to 1768.  I agree that many of the battles did have a somewhat ""staged"" look.  Most of all I was very dissapointed and frustrated by how little importance was given to Forbes's successful campaign of 1758 against Fort Duquesne as compared to the earlier failures of 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock.  In particular, I was somewhat incredulous that there was NO mention of Col. Henry Bouquet, the Swiss mercenary in the British service who was most responsible for Forbes' success.  Finally I could not believe the complete omission of the 1763 Battle of Bushy Run that started as a re-run of Braddock's defeat but ended up as the victory that decided the outcome of Pontiac's War thanks to the wiles of the same Col. Bouquet who certainly must rank as one of the most successful British commanders of this war.",1139788800,85,1886,4.799382716049383
2480910,1,B000E1MXZ0,"I was really looking forward to this documentary but I could not watch it due to all the graphic violence that it portrays.  Definitely not suitable to watch around children.  If you do not like realistic murder scenes (hitting with a hatchet and blood dripping down, shown repeatedly) and realistic lashings complete with blood, do not get this movie.",1138838400,17,352,4.9491525423728815
2480911,3,B000E1MXZ0,"It is nice to see a documentary on a segment of American history that, traditionally, gets little attention.  I do not claim to be an expert on this particular era of history, so i cannot attest to the specific content.  It was enjoyable,entertaining, and a fine overview of the war.

  However, I must take issue with the revisionist history that prevades so many aspects of our society.  For example, the producers are quick to admonish the colonists for their treatment of the American Indians during Pontiac's War; but almost justify and sympathize with the murder, kidnap, and rape of european settlers in the years leading up to, and during the French & Indian War by the natives.  War is a cruel horrible thing, and it upsets me when ""learned"" individuals pass judgement on events that occured two hundred and fifty years prior.  I understand history must always contain a certain amount of bias, but I wish greater effort was made to be impartial and unbias by todays historians.",1138665600,25,987,4.833333333333333
2480912,1,B000E1MXZ0,"For all of the hoopla,this series was a disappointment. There were numerous examples to show that it was poorly researched. First of all,it states that William Pitt was the Prime Minister during the French & Indian War. In reality,he did not become the Prime Minister until 1766,way after the conclusion of F&I.Also,Indian captive James Smith was a woodcutter for the Braddock Expedition of 1755,and not a messenger when he was captured, as was told to the viewers. It also says that George Washington took command of the British forces after the defeat but this is a myth that ranks up there with the chopping down of the cherry tree or throwing a silver dollar across the Potomac River. GW was actually an unpaid volunteer for General Braddock since he resigned his commission in the Virginia Regiment after his defeat at Ft. Necessity in 1754. He wasn't in charge of anything then. When it mentions the Forbes Expedition to take Ft. Duquesne in 1758,it neglects to inform the viewers of the battles that took place along the way such as:Grant's Engagement and the French counterattack on Ft. Ligonier,as if they did not occur. Then,during Pontiac's War of 1763,this series leaves out the pivotal Battle of Bushy Run in Western Pennsylvania. It does cover the raid of the Paxton Boys in Eastern Pa.which is of little historical significance in the overall scheme of things. Much is made of the decree that small pox infected blankets be given to the Indians. Other than the isolated incident at Ft. Pitt,there is little evidence to suggest it was a wide spread or implemented policy. The Indians also dug up the bodies of Provincials at Ft. William Henry who succumbed to a small pox epidemic(including Robert Roger's brother).In that case it was the Native's own greed that spread the disease among their peoples yet the movie doesn't mention that at all. It is unclear as to wether this film is a movie or documentary. The main concept is to lead the viewer to believe that if not for an English victory,we'd all be speaking French today. In reality,the French did not intend to colonize North America,but rather utilize it for trade. Our ancestors would have probably settled somewhere else. In addition to the poor research,the battle scenes looked hokey in that actors and not reenactors were used. The battles scenes in ""The Chronicles of Narnia:The Lion,Witch and the Wardrobe"" looked more realistic. All of the soldiers were seen wearing wigs which wasn't the case,and definitely not on campaign. While the officers wore wigs,the enlisted men would have worn powder & grease in their hair until 1768. It is my understanding that F&I experts from Western Pa.were not used in this production,which explains its short comings. There are surely better movies on the French & Indian War out there than this one. I expect to eventually see this in the $4.99 DVD bin at WAL MART some day.",1138233600,42,2891,4.890020366598778
2480913,5,B000E1MXZ0,"WOW!  To many Americans, the French and Indian War, was a casual footnote in a long ago history class.  Ditto for references to Braddock's Defeat, Fort Duquesne, and Geo. Washington's initial exposure to warfare. To a few more, it might generate a recollection that, if they ever read it, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" by James F. Cooper, was set during this war.  It also inspired Longfellow's epic poem, ""Evangeline"".  A reference to the Siege of Louisbourg or the Plains of Abraham will likely result in a blank look.  My experience over the years has been that our Canadian neighbors and friends have, in many ways, a better understanding of what this war meant to North America than we Americans do.  I refer not only of  the loss of Canada by France to Britain, but the planting and sprouting of issues during this war, that would fuel and feed the sparks of the American Revolution. This series does a wonderful job of taking much history, keeping it factual, chronilogical, understandable, AND, above all, INTERESTING.  It somewhat came across as if I were watching an action/adventure/war movie EXCEPT that I've read several dozen books about the French and Indian War (aka the Seven Years War) and the historical accuracy is generally here.

Because I live in Western Pennsylvania, I became keenly interested in learning about the exploits of  young British colonial George Washington and his links to the settlement of the region then known as ""the forks of the Ohio""  which is now known as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  This documentary explains in lively detail how young Washington's first initial blunder led to the beginning of the war between the British and French for sovereignty of the area.  The actions and attitude that Britain held  for it's second-class colonial citizens during this period sowed the seeds of rebellion which eventually resulted in the American Revolution.  I highly recommend this PBS production to anyone interested in early American history.  Another painful lesson is taught concerning the various Eastern Woodlands Indian tribes who became caught between the warring nations who first sided with the French and then later with the British because they believed this would cause less harm to their culture.",1489190400,4,1298,5.147619047619048

2481149,5,B000E1MXZ0,"I watched this series on German TV, although they only showed parts 3 and 4 for some reason, and thought it was an excellent, well produced documentary with excellent production values that has you reaching for your copies of 'Last of the Mohicans'. They obviously haven't skimped on the budget as some of these other historical reenactment documentaties, which can look quite tacky if not done properly. The Indians look real and quite scary and it does a good job of explainng the complexities of 18th Century North American power politics and the delicately balanced relations between Indians, the British and American colonists, and the French. The books is clearly based on Fred Anderson's masterly work of the same name, which is itself an abridged edition of a much longer work. The TV series follows the identical structure, narrative and reaches virtually the same conclusions as Anderson's book.

As in the book I came away with the sense that of all the groups involved the American colonists come out looking by far the worse and most unsymapathetic. The Indians were non committal, but initially believed the French offered more chance of them keeping what land they had, and protecting them from the rapacious English/American colonists' insatiable thirst for land. The colonists come across as self centred, ungrateful, irresponsible and greedy, refusing to pay their share of the costs for a war was fought to protect them, but were delighted when the British PM Pitt agreed to cover the costs for the duration. However, when the British demanded the colonists pay back some of the costs through taxes it laid the seeds of the so-called American 'revolution', a strange term for what was in effect a self-serving tax revolt.

More importantly perhaps the colonists deeply resented British attempts to block further colonisation west of the Proclamation Line, part of an agreement with the frontiers tribes that included a promise the British gave to the Indians for supporting the war against the French. By 1763 with the French expelled, Britain had no interest in colonising the Ohio Valley and beyond, but the colonists were having none of it.

Not so much a question of what if the French had won, but what if they had joined together with the British and the Indians to agree on a peaceful partition of North America that would have kept western colonisation in check and preserved much of the American wilderness as the homeland of the Indians and the three powers had lived in harmony trading and sharing the abundant resources that were enough for everyone. The British and the Indians expelled the French only to realise their real enemy was in their own backyard just waiting to stab them in the back and take all the spoils for themselves with apocalyptic consequences for the native peoples.",1412985600,3,2819,4.980891719745223

2481152,4,B000E1MXZ0,"Presents this war with four contexts: the Indian, American, British and European. Focuses on the American and Indian. Shows the role George Washington played in this war. Presents the biases and preconceptions of each side in a balanced way.

Relates a chronological narration of the war in America with some connection to the battle in Europe between Britain and France. Explains the difference in the French presence as traders, and the British as colonists. Relates the different views of various British officers to the Indians and the Americans. Shows how the ideas of Pitt, to plead with the Americans to support the war as full British subjects, was successful. Later, when not treated as equals, they rebelled.

Notes the corruption in the French supply program severely weakened the their war effort. Covers the key battles, such as the fall of Quebec, Fort Duquane, etc.

Provides clear explanation of the connection in the mind of the Americans with their experience in this war and their resolve to rebel. Contrasts with the British view that the war in America should be paid for by the Americans. Impasse that led to revolution.

I think one missing idea is the role of the British navy in winning the war. The entire focus is on land warfare. It is noted at the British gained control of the St Lawrence river which enabled them to encircle Quebec. This is naval superiority, the key to British power worldwide.

Interesting. Adds to the understanding of the role of the British empire in dominating the world and not the French.

Washington's part in the conflict is given its due and the rest of the war is presented in good detail. The overall message, of how this war set the stage fro US independence is given clearly and convincingly. Well filmed, the battle sequences are movie worthy (hint hint Hollywood!) and the acting is superb in my opinion(for a docu-drama).

The not-so-good: No mention of the battles fought in 1758 to take Ft Duquesne like Ft. Ligonier or Grant's Defeat (for someone from Pittsburgh this is mortal sin! :) haha). Also, when Pontiac's rebellion is discussed the Battle of Bushy Run is left out completely, even though it was the decisive battle of the conflict. A few points seem to hint at an anti-British propaganda push, but this is barely noticeable to an introductee.

Nota Bene: there is blood (its warfare, duh) the action sequences are meant to make the history come alive, I myself am very interested in this period but if this series were all paintings and photographs of statues I couldn't watch it.

Heroic, innocent Indians are the major theme, and their savagery is excused by every means possible.  Major battles are left out, making room for more commentary on George Washington's self-serfving ambitions.  How the producers could read his mind so thoroughly is beyond me.  To their credit, or more likely because they were ashamed not to, they even allowed one of Washington's references to his reliance on ""Providence"" to be included.  Keep your money.  I threw this video in the trash can as soon as I had finished it.",1348444800,19,620,5.029411764705882
2481197,4,B000E1MXZ0,"This is an enjoyable four part documentary that attempts to bring events of tremendous national and international importance down to a more personal level and mostly succeeds. Many people have little if any awareness of this conflict so anything that sheds light on it is welcome in my opinion.

 The producers do a very creditable job of recreating the atmosphere of the camps, forts, and battles. The soundtrack is great, and the casting of the major roles (Washington, Munro, Montcalm, etc) is quite good- all are very competent actors and 'look the part,' although limitations on casting (and budget) may be evident in the small numbers of combatants in certain re-enactments. Overall, well done on the production.

 However, my hope is always that people will use documentaries such as these as a ""springboard"" to DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH. Why?

 One example is the incident outlined in episode one, involving a very young Colonel George Washington and his first 'real' military engagement. He and his small command attack a camp of French that we are told ""are on a diplomatic mission."" This may well be true, but actually if you look into it the exact intent of this French detachment has never been firmly ascertained and is quite debatable. Were they really on a peaceful mission to deliver a message to the British, as the French themselves contended, or were they hostile scouts as the British thought? No one really knows, but to watch the documentary you would not think there was any doubt about the matter.

 Continuing with this same incident: After Washington's force defeated the French one, Washington's Indian ally, ""The Half King,"" is shown cruelly tomahawking the wounded French commander, (Joseph Jumonville) killing him as Washington looks on in shock (the typical European protocol was to treat captured officers with respect, for social and diplomatic reasons.) Again, this is a commonly accepted account of the aftermath, but it is by no means closed to debate- other accounts state that Jumonville was killed in the initial skirmish by Washingtons forces, Adam Stephen, a military officer who had accompanied Washington to the scene stated that Jumonville ""was kill'd the first fire."" Also, it is unclear as to whether de Jumonville was dispatched by bullet or tomahawk. In his journal, George Washington stated that Half-King ""was credited in certain quarters with having slain ""that officer"" (Jumonville) with his hatchet; but this was without any foundation in fact.""

 The narrator (the excellent Graham Greene) goes on to state unequivocally that the Half-King killed the French officer ""as an act of revenge"" because the French had captured the forks of the Ohio river from the British- ostensibly humiliating the Half-King, making him appear foolish for having allied with the British. However, in actuality, research reveals that his reasons for doing such a thing are not at all clear. The above is as good a theory as any, but it is just that- a theory.

 ALL THAT BEING SAID. The purpose of this style of documentary is to present an engaging and cohesive whole, not to debate the particulars of each event; and in that respect it does a fine job. I liked the dramatized inclusion of some first hand accounts of Indian captives (notably, Mary Jemison and Mary Johnson- remarkable individuals, whose original firsthand narratives can be read freely online, which I HIGHLY recommend- they reveal the cruelties of their Native captors without ignoring their virtues- this is as it should be.) So by all means watch it and learn! Just don't take everything at face value.",1337040000,2,3603,5.047138047138047

Pros:  Great video visually.  Finally a video on the French and Indian War!  It is an overview of the war.

Cons:  This production spends more time attempting to convince you that George Washington was a frightened fool with weak skills as a leader.  This is unfounded and irresponsible.  Why add something like this which is nothing more than an opinion of the author?  This also discusses the Indians in a positive light, ignoring the atrocities they committed to focus solely on those of the English.  One is left feeling that the English were lucky in victory when history does not support this.  This isn't the first time a PBS production has tried to rewrite history to their views today.

2481200,5,B000E1MXZ0,"PBS did an outstanding job with this miniseries.  Told in a semi-documentary manner with stirring narration by Graham Greene and actors portraying George Washington, Montcalm, The Half King and others, this DVD tells the story of a forgotten war more crucial to the birth of the United States than the American Revolution itself.  The musical score by Brian Keane makes use of fantastic original compositions, actual period music and Native American Traditional chants.  While with PBS you always get the view from the Left, there is little of that bias in the actual DVD except in a slight tendency to downplay or ""culturally understand"" the ruthless brutality of Native American warfare, particularly in the Fort William Henry Massacre.  The presentation also goes astray by completely misrepresenting the treatment of captive Mrs. Johnson, giving the viewer the impression that her ""fate"" was the same one Mary Jemison experienced.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The segments dealing with Mary Jemison are particularly well done.  Viewers should be most wary of the roundtable special features discussions, because this is where most of the Left historical revisionism takes place.  Stick to the DVD presentation and forget the spins.  They are not worth it and distort the value of the series as presented.  The Battle of the Wilderness segment and Braddock's folly are exceptionally well done.  The viewer sees almost firsthand how a much smaller force of French and their Native allies crushed the army of the mightiest nation on earth in a single engagement.

2481214,1,B000E1MXZ0,"All is good and well for the first disc (sort of) but in the second half things start getting a bit fishy.  I gritted my teeth through their overtly biased pro-French Disc 1, in which Colonel George Washington is portrayed as effeminate and timid, and okay, fair enough it's decidedly Anglophobic and Franco-centric with a dash of Native-sympathizing thrown in for good measure however they decidedly omit things and phrase things in ways that give an impression of events that is inaccurate.

Washington's battle at Jumonville Glen, the narrator says was ""not heroic"", WHAT!?  Who are you to say what was or wasn't heroic?  Whatever, moving past that, every French military victory is told in great military detail, then when the Brits win in Nova Scotia they skip any aspects of the battle whatsoever and skip right to British atrocities committed afterwards.  So what's the point?  The audience is meant to identify French victories with military prowess, and British victories with evil.  This is done deliberately by the filmmakers and is unfair, biased and irresponsible history.

The Second Disc:
In order to make it look like the French didn't lose that badly, they COMPLETELY OMIT SEVERAL IMPORTANT BRITISH VICTORIES!!  That's right, they talk about the battle of Fort Frontenac and the battle of Louisburg, both British victories, with NO MENTION WHATSOEVER of the Battles of Fort Niagara or La Belle Famille, both of which saw the French get absolutely creamed by the Brits and their American colonists.

But no, none of that.

Then in their pathetic ""telling"" of Pontiac's rebellion, they leave out the Battle of Bushy Run, which was the decisive colonial victory over the Indians that effectively ended the war, and they try to tell the tale of the French-Indian War and Pontiac's rebellion as if the Brits and the Americans got totally whooped.  Well guess what amigoes, if the French and the Indians had won, this continent would mostly speak French with a small English-speaking minority on the eastern seaboard and a Native-American majority west of Appalachia; however none of those things are the case, because the French got defeated, but you wouldn't know that by watching this DVD.

It is worthy of Ken Burns in how carefully it lays out the chronology and geography, and gives good maps to tie it all together.  They use realistic depictions of the period and authentic locations where possible, such as the Carlyle House in Alexandria, VA for example, in the actual room where Braddock did ask the colonists to contribute money for the war effort.  But the one thing they got really right is that they show that George Washington was in at the beginning to become the father of our country, in ways that could not have been foreseen at the time.  How many of you have been to Jumonville Glen?  I thought so.  You will have a hard time finding it on a map, but it is probably the most important location in American history.  I know, you don't believe it, but you will get an idea after seeing this show.

The acting is credible and the quality of the video is very good; it looks almost like Hi-Def on my plasma TV and upconverting DVD player.

Although the French are outnumbered by the British in that period, they allied with the Indians and defeated the British many times. The British first got the support from the colonists by treating them with respect. Then, they realized they need to respect these Indians as well and thus turned the tide of this war. Finally, the British won the war and the French were dispelled out of the North America. The British, however, didn't manage this territory well after winning the war. Their policy favored the Indians but didn't fit the interest of the colonists, which ultimately brought on the Revolution War.

I think the chapters of the French and Indian War are well set in this film. I enjoy the whole watching very much. The impact to the Revolution War, however, seems not thorough enough for me. It's kind of rush, in my opinion. It would be good to have more discussions or deeper analysis for the linkage.

And, good gracious, also a slave holder!  Is this consistent with what we know he volunteered for and endured later on?

8104094,5,B000E1MXZ0,"Excellent documentary. One thing is very clear with this documentary: it does not put George Washington in a very good light. Even suggesting that Washington would not stop until he got 'his' Ohio land away from the Indians regardless of a treaty and that he was greedy,greedy, greedy including his marriage to Martha. The documentary claims that it was due to you inexperienced George Washington that the French and Indian war started. He came across some Frenchmen on the trail with his troops and unbeknownst to him they were on an approved mission to reach the British. He gave orders to open fire on them. And so, the war began. Graham Greene is excellent as the narrator. Interesting facts of history included in this documentary.",1513382400,,736,4.896
