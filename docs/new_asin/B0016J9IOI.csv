3157097,5,B0016J9IOI,"This DVD set is by far the best thus far! I own all of Abrahams workshops and this one really really brings the viewer into their own flow & knowing!
So many areas are covered,so many questions answered that you come away from this experience uplifted and validated in your own inner guidance which leads one to wanting to view it over & over..I truly love all of the Abraham~Esther & Jerry Hicks dvds available. But,this one is my personal favorite. You will not be disappointed at all. Abraham conveys truth in every question/topic which tends to place your soul in an infinite dance with source. THIS IS A MUST HAVE DVD.You will NOT be disappointed~I guarantee it.
Regarding the previous reviwer:Quite possibly that individual is out of alignment with the downward flow and is still paddling upstream!
I found that particular segment on clean and sober to be quite fascinating but most of all,Extremely truthful regarding the AA program & the 12 step program. Nothing should be a lifetime to get sober and to move on vs. staying in a program for life! If you keep doing the same thing and expecting different results than think again or ""I should say feel""you will keep getting more of the same.
WTG Abraham/Esther & Jerry Hicks on all topics covered in this dvd set by far the best! I highly recomend this set to all. 1 billion stars*!!!

Also, a wide variety of topics are covered in unique ways. Abe always gives a great perspective on life -- uplifting, wise, and always spiritual. Abraham Hicks will be the salvation of the 21st century. Seriously. If you have not yet discovered this philosophy, it is time!",1337040000,,422,4.716216216216216
3157099,5,B0016J9IOI,"While it does seem that each episode in this series is better than the last, this is still one of my favorites. I have watched it four or five times now. Each time I get something out of it, and each time I find it enjoyable. These DVD presentations are better than the books in my opinion. As you work your way through them, you find a lot of the material is reworked. I do get a little tired of hearing about Jerry and Esther's rafting trip, and the analogy of traveling from Phoenix to San Diego. In this particular DVD, they do not rely on those overused metaphors too much. The opening address is stimulating, even after I have watched it several times.

The audience here seems a particularly rare bunch, and Abraham surfs along on their energy. The first person is a fellow named Happy who wants to write a book to teach people how to be happy. Abraham has a fun time with him. The segment with the modern hippie is vintage Abraham. It is also the first time in this series that Abraham talks about being cut out of the documentary, The Secret. As Abraham says, the secret was cut out of The Secret.

On the second DVD, Abraham gives their take on AA's 12 step program. This is a riot. It is also very insightful. Abraham does give the program its due, saying that it has helped a lot of people. But, as with so much that we do, it is a long difficult path to get where you're going. And perhaps there are a few too many 'mia culpa's along the way.

This episode ends with a woman who answered the call of revenge, winning the admiration of all of her coworkers. Abraham does warn her that if she continues to feel responsible for all of the others, they will hold her back from her own advancement. Abraham's advice is to leave them to find their own way at their own pace, as they surely will.

This set has many great moments in it. It is not to be missed.",1323129600,2,1866,4.23314606741573

3157101,5,B0016J9IOI,"""Abraham"", a name for a group of non-physical entities channeled by Esther Hicks, has offered life affirming information to those ""Leading Edge"" people who make the choice to listen. I've made that choice. I have many books, CD's and DVD's of Abraham. The DVD's are portions of Abraham-Hicks seminars. They all begin with Esther, eyes closed, allowing herself to become a physical vehicle for the non-physical entities. I mention this because without that knowledge in advance, people who are not open to the idea of channeling might not accept the information presented.

That said, the Law of Attraction in Action Episode 5 is on par with the other episodes. If you appreciate the other ones, you will appreciate this one. What really stood out for me was Abraham's take on the 12 Steps used in most programs that deal with addiction. People who rely on those programs may not agree with Abraham's view, but people who would benefit from a program of that type who are not willing to become part of a fellowship might heed Abraham's words. I also applaud Esther and Jerry Hicks for including this part of their seminar on DVD. Disagreeing with people's belief systems can have repercussions.

All in all, good stuff here. I highly recommend this DVD and hope others enjoy it as much as I did.",1274745600,,1294,4.798206278026906

3157107,5,B0016J9IOI,"First of all, I have never met an Abraham-Hicks DVD that I didn't like and I own almost all of them.  However, this particular 2-DVD Set has to rank as one of my favorites!

The workshop from which these DVDs were taken was actually the first Abraham-Hicks workshop that I ever attended. I had only encountered Abraham about six months earlier through their marvelous book ""Ask and It Is Given.""  I was already enthusiastic, but attending this workshop is what really propelled me forward into further studies of ""The Teachings of Abraham"" and The Law of Attraction.

At the beginning of a workshop, Abraham lets everyone know that although they might not get called to the ""hot seat,"" that all of their questions will be answered nonetheless.  This was absolutely true for me.  I received answers where I hadn't even formulated a question yet, much less been able to verbalize one.  I just had a desire for greater understanding on various topics (relationships, career path, writing, healing, etc.), which Abraham managed to provide with INCREDIBLE LOVE, INSIGHT, AND HUMOR!  (Abraham is quite hilarious!)  And, having gotten sober 25+ years before, I especially enjoyed the segment on AA and the 12 Steps.

Now, watching these DVDs almost 1 1/2 years after the workshop, I find myself enjoying and appreciating this material even more! I've been gaining additional insights into the topics covered and am laughing at Abraham's remarks just as hard, if not harder.

I'll often start my day by watching a portion from one of Abraham's DVDs.  Whenever I do, it sets a great tone for the rest of the day, as I usually feel fantastic afterwards!  Thank you Abraham, Esther, and Jerry for yet another wonderful set of DVDs to enjoy!  Please keep them coming, as my life just keeps getting better and better.",1220745600,23,1804,4.872131147540983

8262702,5,B0016J9IOI,"Hi, I love this one in particular, because the information on the Secret is finally revealed. So interesting, good listen, and I have many times. Do as I did, and read the reviews on any of these and make your own decision on which to get first. I just jumped in and I have no regrets. I have more than one now and am enjoying watching over and then again.
I am learning how not to be frustrated with others, family and more. This was all so deep to me in the beginning, but now, I am clearer, and can better understand. I honestly think, for me, I was so busy trying to keep a roof over and food on the table that work was my life and I could not hear anything else, or make any sense of anything like this. This is my own opinion of me, and I am new to Abraham teachings.
I hope this review was helpful to you. If you want to get started, just read the reviews first then form your own opinion and see where it takes you. It can be deep and sometimes, at least for me, hard to understand or grasp, but that is just me. I have had a cluttered mind, trying to keep up with everything, so these CDs and DVDs have helped me a lot to understand what I was doing to me. Good luck and read first, then jump in if you want :) I believe that each individual will take away a different vibe. Thank you",1471305600,,1293,3.9578544061302683

8262709,5,B0016J9IOI,"I've seen / heard the majority of Abraham-Hicks' materials and for anyone overwhelmed by the sheer number of books, audiobooks, and DVDs available, I would recommend the following:

The written books are good, and have their place. Some people will find these the most appropriate source for Abraham wisdom. Each of us is different. However, for me, it is the immediacy and intensity of Abraham being audibly spoken, in-the-moment, that has the greatest impact upon me. It's very compelling. For this reason, I get far more out of the audio and video offerings than I do out of the books.

Of the audios, I highly recommend 'The Law of Attraction: The Basics Of The Teachings Of Abraham'. I recommend this CD set not only for newcomers to Abraham, but also to seasoned fans. Why? Because the content therein is EXCEPTIONALLY incisive. It is recordings of original dialogues between Abraham (channeled through Esther)and Jerry, and the content is extremely focused, concise, to-the-point and clear, and therefore all the more compelling.

Of the DVDs, the set you are currently viewing on this page ('Revealing the Secret!: The Law of Attraction In Action, Episode V') is undoubtedly one of the very best of their DVDs. It is part of the 12-part 'Law of Attraction In Action' series and ranks very much near the top of this series. Definitely recommended.

Also very worthwhile is the 'Ask and it is Given' DVD set (4 discs). This is different from most of Abraham's DVD offerings because, in contrast to the 12 volume 'Law of Attraction In Action' series and the (at time of this writing) 7-part 'Vortex of Attraction' series, 'Ask and it is Given' is NOT live workshop footage. Instead, it is intimate studio interview footage, and it is a joy to watch, with some great Abraham insights delivered in a different manner to that witnessed in the live workshops.

So, in summary, for anyone new to Abraham and wondering where to begin, then by all means consider the books if you enjoy that format, but if you get more out of audios and/or DVDs, then I recommend the following:

1) 'The Law of Attraction: The Basics Of The Teachings Of Abraham' (original dialogues) - CD Audio

2) 'Ask and it is Given' DVD set (4 discs)

3) 'Revealing the Secret!: The Law of Attraction In Action, Episode V' DVD set

Thereafter, other Abraham DVDs with good content include:

* 'The Vortex, Where The Law of Attraction Assembles All Cooperative Relationships'

* 'Getting Into the Vortex: The Law of Attraction in Action, Episode XII'

* 'The Teachings of Abraham: The Master Course Video' (5 DVD set) - (""...adding to the specifics of what you want increases the speed of the energy that's flowing through you. That's exactly the way that it works; you identify through contrast and Object-of-attention, and your inner being becomes in alignment with that, and then becomes the attractor, or drawer, of the energy THROUGH you TO that which you have identified as the object of your desire

...We've talked before about how your desires summon energy THROUGH you, but the REASON that your desires summon energy THROUGH you is because the part of you that is source; that is in agreement with the newfound decision that you've made, becomes that point of summoning power, AND that point of absolute ALLOWING power, in your vibration, and so when you identify that you want something, that part of you that is Source begins calling that to that part that is Source, and it's coming through YOU, so any resistance that you've got going on within you, becomes more apparent once the energy moves faster.

...and so your resistance...just shows up more, so-to-speak, and so then your work becomes more about doing something about releasing your resistance..."")

* Also excellent, if you can find it, is the audio recording 'London Workshop, Saturday 2008-05-17  F0815'. This contains a really superb opening monologue; extremely clear, comprehensive, and concise.",1360195200,5,3942,4.93202416918429
