8495996,5,B006BAC87Q,Great movie!,1482278400,,12,5.5
8495997,2,B006BAC87Q,While this documentary does tell a someehat intresting story it fails in many places. It fails to capture the community of fighting games. It is not a documentary that I think fighting gane fans will enjoy. They don't even show the matches people play.,1459209600,,252,4.75
8495998,4,B006BAC87Q,"Good content, really great perspective to view things from...most people in the FGC may or may not know that this was happening, but glad that it came to light.",1454544000,,160,4.551724137931035
8495999,1,B006BAC87Q,I didn't even make it through the whole movie. It's just terrible and I usually enjoy low budget documentaries.,1442361600,,111,4.894736842105263
8496000,2,B006BAC87Q,There was a good documentary in this subject - Mr. Wong -  but the doc was weighed down by his hangers constant grandstanding and self promoting.,1431388800,,145,4.576923076923077
8496001,5,B006BAC87Q,Super good movie if you love street fight or if you are apart of the fighting video game community.,1417824000,,99,4.2631578947368425
8496002,4,B006BAC87Q,Pretty good,1413763200,,11,5.0
8496003,1,B006BAC87Q,"If the music was better I would score two stars. The narrative does not exist, the story kind of sucked in the first place, and the title doesn't make any sense.",1404864000,,161,4.225806451612903
8496004,1,B006BAC87Q,"It seems like people who make documentaries about video games and/or the video game community haven't a slightest clue on how to tell an effective story. First of all, assume that people who watch your documentary don't know anything about video games. Why should we care about Justin Wong? Other than a brief clip of him saying that he's a pro gamer because he wants to take care of his grandmother, we know nothing about Justin. We don't really hear his thoughts either, other than a few comments on this or that. The subject of King of Chinatown remains a stranger to the audience throughout the picture. Why should we care about competitive gaming? What makes the players like Justin stand above the rest? What are the strategies they employ? What about telling us about the games they are playing, and why? How about telling us about the Chinatown arcade? What is the history of it? Who are some of the legends of that arcade? None of these questions are answered, or if they are, the director barely scratches the surface. Instead, we are treated to a lot of poorly edited competition montages to bad generic royalty free rock music. The director even fails to capture the growing final year of tension between Justin Wong and Triforce Johnson that leads to their split.

One of the great things about new digital filmmaking is that it democratizes the medium, so that you can now make a movie without the financial backing of a big time studio. Films like King of Chinatown is an example of one of the cons of new digital filmmaking, in that people who are clearly incompetent and incapable of telling a story now can do so on an industrial scale. Expect to see more blunders like King of Chinatown to crop up all over the place, drowning out the voices of real talent.",1400976000,6,1776,4.620253164556962
8496005,1,B006BAC87Q,It's a slow boring documentary on one video game player. It also shows you how money changes relationships in a bad way,1397520000,2,119,4.454545454545454
