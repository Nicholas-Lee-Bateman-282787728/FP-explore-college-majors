8303476,4,B001G0MFDI,"Evening Shade is a great series with what had to be the greatest cast for an ensemble comedy ever. Burt Reynolds..Marilu Henner..Charles Durning..Hal Holbrook..Ossie Davis..Elizabeth Ashley..Ann Wedgeworth...WOW ! The series formula is much like The Andy Griffith Show. Small town life..Burt is mostly the straight man to the eccentric residents of the town. This series has enough good episodes to be well worth the money..<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evening-Shade-Season-One/dp/B00005JOXR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evening Shade - Season One</a>",1338681600,3,590,7.208333333333333

8303478,5,B001G0MFDI,I saw this series when it was on TV and loved it!  I bought the first season and loved it again.  The humor and blend of characters is perfect.  Some of the lines are so clever and I find myself chuckling all the time.  I have been waiting over a year for the second season.  I keep wondering what is keeping the second season from being released. I am ready for some more Evening Shade humor.,1285977600,9,393,4.118421052631579
