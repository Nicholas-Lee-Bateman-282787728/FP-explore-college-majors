8281977,5,B001B67PF0,I am sooooooo tired of misinformed zealots good-looking over Halloween and it's evil. Look up All Souls Day after looking up Halloween on dictionary.com.,1382054400,,153,5.416666666666667
8281978,1,B001B67PF0,"I wanted a movie to explain to kids why as Christians we don't celebrate Halloween, and this movie didn't do that.
It went on how we can celebrate it on other ways. CELEBRATING HALLOWEEN, IT'S CELEBRATING HALLOWEEN.
So as I Christian, I DON'T recommend this movie, since it's telling kids they can celebrate it.",1351555200,,311,4.777777777777778
8281979,5,B001B67PF0,"My family celebrated a Christian Passover for the 1st time this year.  This movie was a great intro for my 1 and 3 year old.  The Dayenu song was great.  We played that track during our Seder.  Overall, definitely glad I purchased.",1334534400,,231,4.428571428571429
8281980,5,B001B67PF0,"We celebrate a Passover Feast every year in our Children's Ministry to teach them how the Isrealites Passover, the Last Supper and the Lord's Table are all connected.  I was tired of giving the same lesson with my poster/chart.  This little film was the perfect length for a lesson and fun to watch for kids and adults.  The puppet characters are sweet and give good information.",1334275200,,379,4.712121212121212
8281981,5,B001B67PF0,"This video is a terrific way to teach a Christian understanding of Halloween.  It weaves in various Bible stories (the Mighty Fortress, the Great Shepherd, and more!)  The Bible stories all have different drawings in them to illustrate the stories in a way that everyone can understand.  Although the main characters are puppets, the students we had in grades K-10 all got something out of this video; you could've heard a pin drop as the video was shown.  One of the neatest things on this video is the carving of the jack-o-lantern and a song that reminds us that we are Jesus' light.  With song, a great storyline, and various Bible stories, everyone (yes, even adults!) can learn something new from this video.",1227312000,2,714,4.772357723577236
