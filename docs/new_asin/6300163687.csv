213035,5,6300163687,"It was hard to watch this since it was never on film and the only remaining copies to make the DVD master from were only preserved on video tape.
Still it is the only way you are going to get to see these rare and legendary performances.
If you have an old player with antenna connections and an equally old analog TV to hook it up to, go ahead and relive the old days.
It looks just fine that way.
It looks the way the original VHS retail tapes of the performances played.
Today we have higher expectations of what our home video systems can deliver and many out there do not even remember what ""State of The Art"" really delivered in the analog TV era.",1423872000,,653,4.190476190476191
213036,5,6300163687,We all need to see Buddy Hackett to appreciate his great comedy.  Hilarious!,1416700800,,76,4.846153846153846

213121,4,6300163687,This DVD  presented material by this comedian in a way that made it come across very hilarious and enjoyable. Surprising conclusion by Hackett as he completes his routine.,1403308800,,171,5.107142857142857
213122,5,6300163687,This thing is a guilty pleasure. I even caught my wife laughing at it after dismissing it as sophomoric. Hackett is a funny man.,1402876800,,128,4.375
213123,5,6300163687,Had this originally on VHS and due to age was no longer usable. The DVD is great.  Made my day.,1402531200,,95,3.75
213124,5,6300163687,Buddy Hackett always had the funniest dirty stories told in a manner that my jaws ached so very much from laughing. Excellent DVD.,1396742400,,130,4.695652173913044
213125,5,6300163687,"Go ahead spend the 60 bucks and get this along with #2. You won't be sorry. True the content could be better but I'm content with that, I was used to watching this on DVD so it's an improvement. He is the best comedian who ever graced the planet. Sooooo funny!!!",1395446400,,262,4.1568627450980395
213126,2,6300163687,"I have searched many times for the HBO SPECIAL that was made with Buddy Hackett doing his show in Las Vegas.  The promotion on this DVD was mis-leading, a poor production...the screen was expanded and made him look like a bigger fat man than he was in real life. IN addition...it is only a 70 min production and HALF of the program...and I PAID $29.99...okay...$30.  For the poor quality and limited show content I feel that I was ripped off!",1393372800,5,442,4.5125
213127,5,6300163687,"This is one of the funniest skits you'll ever see.  I first saw this 30 years ago and have been talking about , and quoting, it forever.  I was so pleased to finally find it .  Unlike todays comedians,  this is hysterical without being vulgar.  A must see.",1389657600,,256,4.25
213128,5,6300163687,"I had a VHS copy of this show and was glad to find
a DVD.  It is incredibly funny.  Wish he were doing
more.",1389571200,,108,3.4583333333333335
213129,5,6300163687,As good today as it was back in 1983 even though I've seen at least a dozen times. It is a little raw but not offensive.,1388188800,,120,3.6538461538461537
213169,5,6300163687,I have always loved Buddy Hackett's humor and stories about his friendship with the Sinatra gang in Vegas...he's an ICON in his profession !,1385942400,,140,4.875
213170,5,6300163687,Buddy Hackett is simply one of the best of all times.  That goofy smile and crazy sense of humor will keep you laughing,1382486400,,119,4.173913043478261
213171,5,6300163687,"I recorded this onto VHS, when it first came out on HBO, but playing it for 30 years, sadly, made the video quality unbearable. When DVDs came out, I looked and even wrote snail mail letters to HBO, never hearing back. After GOOGLE came along, I only found others also searching. Then finally, my search said Amazon had it! I bought it and eagerly waited. I had built it up so much, I wondered if it would still be as terrific as I remembered, and it WAS! Sure it looks like the 80's! It was, and that just adds to the hilarity. Some will find Buddy's words offensive (that is even part of the performance) but this is classic Buddy Hackett and it is so funny, I cry laughing, every time. I cannot decide which I love most, this or version one, I love both!",1381708800,,757,4.227586206896552
213172,5,6300163687,This is absolutely the best comedian ever. Everyone enjoys this cd. Buddy Hackett was always fantastic on Johnny Carson and here he is doing it again at Atlantic City.,1379721600,,167,4.793103448275862
213173,5,6300163687,Buddy Hackett was one of old school comedy's great geniuses.  His ability to go from clean cut Disney to raunchy Atlantic City and back is still something today's comedians have a hard time doing.,1379289600,,196,4.764705882352941
213174,5,6300163687,"After seeing videos on youtube from this act, I get to see it all in high definition and enjoy it.",1378166400,,98,3.95
213175,1,6300163687,he was a fantastic stand up.i enjoyed seeing it again. so much could be learned from observing his style. thanks,1377475200,,112,4.65
213176,4,6300163687,"This review is for the dvd called Live and Uncensored 1.

Comes in a Thin Fold Cardboard Printed Cover and Protected.

This ran 72m i rate this good you get 3 xtras with this and they are.
About My Elephant-color clip-1m
Stanley-Warming up the television audience-7m
Stanley-Tv show with guest star Carol Burnett-25m

This has a clear picture and sound is as it should be,understandable.

I'm thinking that the volume 2 1985 show is more funny,i'll find out when i play it.

One thing about watching Buddy Hackett doing his thing,your eyes will water from laughing,guaranteed.

I still recommend this very rare and hard to find dvd,just glad that they finally put the two shows on dvd.",1370649600,,685,4.811965811965812
213177,5,6300163687,I couldn't believe I finally found these shows on DVD(Vol 2 as well). The quality is SO much better than the VHS copies I used to have. His acts as so hilarious you should not miss it!,1370131200,,184,4.0
213178,5,6300163687,I am soooo glad it has made it's way to DVD. I tapped it off of TV way back in 1983. I have bought it on VHS and now on DVD. He is so funny. I have watched this so many times over the years I wore the tape out. I have shown this to people who were not fans of Buddy Hackett and after they watched this they became fans. This is a must see!!,1368662400,,340,3.486842105263158
213219,5,6300163687,"Those were his words, not mine.  Finally we have the great Buddy Hackett in all his glory and it's about time.  He was one of the last of the great story tellers who related to, respected and appreciated his audience.  The very real deal and a wonderful man. Buy both DVDs, Volume 1 and Volume 2, today!",1366243200,,303,4.280701754385965

213221,5,6300163687,"Great for parties and group gatherings. Take it camping and show on the side of the camper, pack a cooler.",1363305600,,106,4.35
213222,5,6300163687,already had this on vhs.  been looking for a dvd version for years. funniest concert I've ever seen. love it.,1359849600,4,109,4.45
213223,5,6300163687,"We taped this waaaay back when it was on HBO originally, wish I still had the tape. My parents and I were always turned off by foul language and such, but this was the exception. I remember my dad, who rarely cracked up, hanging over his chair in hysterics, mom quoting it weeks later, and me remembering lines  all these years after. He jokes about Judaism (he was Jewish), having a barium enema at a Vegas hospital, has the audience losing it as he tries to get a respectable audience member to say dirty words, and interacts with a man in the audience about impotence. I loved how the man's wife gets on him for talking about it on TV! Be warned, this is not for kids! The fish story, no, you won't want kids to hear that either, and the punchline is very 70s/80s and might go over the heads of people who weren't around then and the punchline is what makes it. Rarely do you find a person who is outright potty mouthed but you don't really mind because he's funny and cute in a goofy way. If you have a friend who is always wound up, looking for something to be offended by, don't show them this! Hey Buddy: This one's for Frieda!!",1313020800,6,1135,4.25462962962963
213224,5,6300163687,"I recorded this off my TV back in 1983. I'm glad I did as the cost for the VHS is out of sight!
It's a great show and I'm hoping it comes out on DVD. I keep checking Amizon to see if it's on DVD. But so far it hasn't. A truly great one of a kind comic as pasted. A class of his own.
 We miss you Buddy.",1312243200,,302,3.3768115942028984
213225,5,6300163687,"This was a replacement for our original tape that finally disentegrated from use. We play this tape many times when company come over, especially for those friends who are not familiar with how funny Buddy was - they are always converted to fans!",1283731200,,246,4.744186046511628
213226,5,6300163687,"This wasn't the video with the owl joke and the black Russian, but in some ways it was even better because I didn't have to sit through the lame pizza business.  Hackett's as good as it gets.",1253750400,,191,4.162162162162162
213227,5,6300163687,"This is the first Buddy Hackett video released for home video. It was originally manufactured by USA Home Video then re-released in 2000 by the Estate of Buddy Hackett ""Hackett Entertainment Inc"". It was filmed at Resorts International in Atlantic City in March 1983 and is on one tape. The estate also re-released another of Buddy's live performances which was filmed at Caesars Palace in October 1985. Some people confuse these videos and assume they are a set but that is incorrect, each is sold separately. Both contain adult oriented material and are hysterically funny.",1170374400,16,575,5.063157894736842

7803742,5,6300163687,Absolutely ecstatic to see this available in DVD.  I actually recorded this myself (maybe off of HBO) in the early 90s.  Never saw it available to purchase prior to purchasing this.  Was hoping it was the exact same show that I had recorded and it was!  Buddy Hackett is a funny guy and this particular show is great.,1453161600,,317,4.413793103448276

I love the way he interacted with the audience - intelligent man.  We just don't have comics like him anymore.  Don't be afraid to purchase this DVD, it's well worth the money.",1440892800,,351,4.1940298507462686
