7957954,4,B000062XG9,We got this movie mainly because we heard it has a Corvair Ultravan in it and we are fans of the Ultravan.  But it turned out to be a fairly good movie too.,1370736000,,156,3.727272727272727
7957955,5,B000062XG9,"After the guys start sharing their bad experiences with wives and girlfriends, you start to feel for them.  Yet you know the plot has to have some resolution.  You know their bachelor party weekend has to end so Charlie Sheen can attend his wedding.

I won't spoil anything, but I must say the heartfelt resolution of the plot tugs at your heartstrings.

Women also will find the film very erotic.  Who needs nudity ?  I found the guys to be very sexy wearing their suits and ties.  Fair - haired David Sherrill, who plays the part of the divorced Ray Vanowen, looks especially good in his suit and tie.  I also like his acting.  He convinced me that Ray's decision to live in an isolated trailer home was understandable.

If you live near Big Bear Lake or Lake Arrowhead, you'll be struck by the breathtaking location cinematography of that part of California.  The mountainous scenery was mostly destroyed by fire several years later.

Please rent this movie.  If you're a casting agent, please cast David Sherrill in something.  Maybe Charlie Sheen can put him on an episode of Two And A Half Men.",1146096000,3,1100,4.632124352331606
7957956,5,B000062XG9,"Five Aces is the kind of movie, which comes along only once in a milennia!!! The film is outstanding. Charlie Sheen is excellent as he portrays a man who is about to be married. His four best buddies from high school throw a pseudo bachelor party weekend for him in they're hometown. The group, known as the Five Aces, party on and try to convince Sheen that marriage can be a scary thing. As you can imagine, the Aces are a spry group who pull many comical pranks. They display the type of wacky hijinks that will have you laughing for days.
The group bonds with they're various heartbreak stories but are always there to lift a fellow Ace up when he's down. They get together to reminisce and have a karaoke scene which is one of the greatest scenes in the annals of film.
On a personal note, this film changed my life. I will always be grateful for the comedy stylings of the Five Aces. I can't recomend strongly enough that everyone should see this movie!",1053475200,3,959,4.393258426966292

7957958,2,B000062XG9,"""Five Aces"" is a very mediocre film, and is even a little watchable. Why you would want to watch it is an entirely different matter. It's sort of melodramatic, with a few situations intended to be humorous, but nothing ever rises to the ocassion of lifting the film off the ground. We are given characters with no real situations and with relationships that never seem to be developed beyond that of acquaintences, yet they are supposed to be five best friends. Charlie Sheen plays a guy who's about to be married to a beautiful Greek woman and embarks on a weekend with his four best friends. Together, they're known as the Five Aces, though a more appropriate name would be the Four Guys and Charlie Sheen. Sheen never once seems to be part of the group, yet he's the reason they're brought together. During the time they spend together (which might be longer than a weekend), they get themselves into trouble that would seem funny to anybody actually there, but since we're watching the movie, it lacks any sort of interesting qualities. This is also one of those movies where everybody has a soul-searching monologue that gets everybody thinking for a minute before going back for a few beers and ladies. These guys don't really think all that much, and when they do it's in brief bursts of anger about their lives. The sad thing about ""Five Aces"" is that it's doomed to be predictable. There's nothing that could've happened that wouldn't have made this film predictable. Which raises the question: why was it made in the first place? It wasn't in theaters, despite star power, and I suspect this is because the outcome is obvious even if you haven't even seen the preview. Such is the fate of ""Five Aces,"" a pointless movie with nothing at all fascinating or poignant.",1051660800,3,1774,4.707395498392283
7957959,1,B000062XG9,"A friend of mine and I recently tried to figure out what the five worst movies of all time were.  This one came in second, just behind Cool as Ice (Starring Vanilla Ice).  ... I believe even Charlie Sheen was embarrased by this movie as his name is listed as ""Charles Sheen"" in the credits.  The worst part is that it's not even bad in a funny way, just in a way that makes you sad and want to cry for being a member of the same species that produced this movie.
This movie made me want to rip my own eyes out.",1027555200,4,510,3.9320388349514563
