8225337,2,B000WRZ8GM,"This was a very boring, uninteresting movie. I felt it was so long, and the movie only lasts 90 minutes. It's about a journalist whose life is so boring and so empty, that she decides it's time to look for her man. While looking for him, she runs into an apartment where she plans to make an add in the newspaper about renting this place, she finds a picture of a man, who she feels is her ""Love of her Life"". She is determined to meet this man, so she decides to buy everything this man sells (what a stupid idea, don't you think). Forgetable. Save your time!",1207440000,,560,4.194444444444445
