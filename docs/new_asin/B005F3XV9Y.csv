4671109,5,B005F3XV9Y,"This is the most entertaining food documentary out there, and it expresses complex food issues like farm subsidies and the obesity epidemic in simple, human terms. It's fun to watch, even as the filmmakers confront the issues head on. It's also family-friendly, and at times, it's quite funny. Throughout the film, the scenes are effective and memorable. The filmmakers take the food stamp challenge and bring us with them grocery shopping and as they bicker about how to allocate their food, but they also take us out into the world to talk to Members of Congress, and to people who are applying for food stamps, delivering food at food banks, or purchasing food at farmers markets. The depiction of typical school lunches is sad and hilarious all at the same time, but the film also provides some inspiration by highlighting programs and colorful characters who help provide fresh, healthy, affordable food for everyone. I highly recommend it.",1352073600,,945,5.025477707006369
4671110,3,B005F3XV9Y,"While I appreciate the attempt to educate people about how to eat well on a tight budget, the filmakers glossed over many of the issues faced by poor people. Examples:

1. They used herbs and spices from their garden.  Many people do not have land on which to plant a garden and would have to buy their own herbs.  As a result, cooking ""tasty"" meals from scratch would be quite a bit more expensive.  And what do people do in the winter?

2. The one of the film makers is a chef with a kitchen fully stocked with appliances and utensils.  Not everyone can afford all of that.

3. They shopped at upscale stores and farmers' markets.  They don't have too many Whole Foods stores with grains and beans in bulk in the ghetto.  Try finding organic spinach and the corner drug store!

4. Most people on food stamps are not childless couples with nothing to do besides cook, shop, and film a documentary.  They should try repeating the experiment with three kids and two jobs!

Lastly, they really couldn't do the experiment for more than a week!?  Morgan Spurlock did the McDonald's diet for a whole month and ""No Impact Man"" did his experiment for an entire year.  I just feel that the film didn't really get into any of the hard issues.  The worst it got for them was having to take a dime from a stranger to buy a loaf of French bread so they wouldn't have to be ""embarrased"" in front of their dinner guest.",1351814400,14,1405,4.370656370656371
4671111,5,B005F3XV9Y,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary.  It was reminiscent of another insightful film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Size-Me/dp/B0002OXVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Size Me</a>; but instead of experimenting with junk food, the filmmakers experimented with healthy food on a food stamp budget (which is shamefully low).  There are many factors that encourage the unhealthy habit of consuming high sugar and high fat diets, such as subsidies for junk food, food ""deserts"" where healthy food is hard to find, and hundreds of millions of dollars of marketing from the junk food industry.  While the problem of obesity crosses class lines, it is especially profound among the poor.  Oftentimes, shopping at an organic food store is out of reach on a limited budget, and fresh produce and farmers markets can be hard to find in impoverished areas; so, a film like ""Food Stamped"" that focuses on the circumstance of poverty has been desperately needed.
  In addition to their own helpful tips about how to make ends meet while eating healthy, the filmmakers also introduce us to other efforts to expand the range of food choices for everybody, including food banks that are making an effort to provide healthier options, and farmers markets that are setting up in low-income neighborhoods.
  Apparently, this was the first film created by the directors, and I was impressed by the quality of its production.  ""Food Stamped"" is an important contribution to this country's growing food movement that will lead to healthier people and a healthier planet.

4671112,5,B005F3XV9Y,"I appreciated the information and facts provided in the movie and that they put a face to those who are faced with living in these conditions.  I would highly recommend watching this movie to get a perspective of those faced with economic limitations and issues related to institutionalized classism. Granted the film-makers themselves living on a food-stamp diet did have handy access to herbs in the backyard, free day-old bread from a breadery, produce at a food bank, and free samples at stores.  I don't know if these scenarios are often available in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, especially when grocery stores may not even be available.  Despite this, it was nice that the filmmakers featured organizations that did do things differently, like being able to exchange food stamps for a card to use at a farmer's market.  I really enjoyed the piece on nutrition in the schools, and how locally grown food can feed a large urban school district.  They also included a program about teaching kids about food in the classroom, as well as an urban program for teens about growing farm fresh food. I think we need to take these positive notes as inspirations for action.",1334534400,8,1182,4.979695431472082
4671113,3,B005F3XV9Y,"Yes this film was informative and I wouldn't tell people not to watch it. Just to take it with a grain of salt. The filmmakers decided to go on the ""food stamps diet"" where they could only spend about $1 per person per meal. They vowed to only eat healthy, organic food during this week. The continually ignored difficulties faced by those on food stamps by doing things such as taking herbs from their herb garden (many of the people on food stamps don't even have a home). They also did not take into account that most people do not have their kind of background on cooking organically and would never be able to make the sorts of meals that they made...especially if they are homeless with no real kitchen. While the filmmakers tried to do something good, their lightheartedness as well a their optimism that everyone can eat well on a food stamp diet was off-putting.",1334361600,19,871,4.554140127388535

4671175,2,B005F3XV9Y,"The Potashs were insufferable hipsters. I had to watch this film for an urban studies class in which we are studying food insecurity. Hobbyists like the Potashs who make a game out of living on a food stamp budget have no real insight into what it means to be chronically poor. As soon as the challenge was over, I am sure that they went straight for the organic markets and coffeeshops of Berkeley, a real hotbed for these type of people who exist in an elitist subculture, coming out, from time to time, to act socially conscious in the most annoying fashion.",1411084800,8,561,4.509803921568627
4671176,1,B005F3XV9Y,"This documentary follows a yuppie good hearted couple while they take a ""food stamp challenge"". They eat for a week on $2 per meal.

I will separate my review into pro and con.
Pro
I like that they mixed in stories of people who were living in poverty.
Showing schools and the programs they support was a good way to show what is already being done about this problem
I liked that they involved the nutritionist

cons: (spoilers)
I really became frustrated with the tone of this film. The frustration with food stamps seemed to be directed at the poor people spending them, or rather what they spent them on rather than at legislation, lack of education etc
There were several decisions here that were questionable to say the least. This couple has refused to change their eating habits. They still bought organic/free range/ hormone free etc. At first I was willing to give it a try even if I thought that was dumb. However, you have to agree that they are presenting an experiment on the other end of the spectrum. They went overboard to be healthy.  So therefore, if it can't be done this way then it can't be done.
One questionable decision after another was made.  Taking several free samples of cheese,  using herbs from their garden to flavor their meals (not an option in appartments, hotels, hostile climates),  dumpster diving to get organic bread and selling wine and other glass bottles that you would likely not have access to if you really lived this way.

Seriously though,  this couple would rather short through moldy organic loaves in a dumpster than bow down and eat like the rest of us peasants. This is not a real option for families on food stamps. If their kids got sick from rotten food because the parents wouldn't not eat organic they wood be taken by CPS.

The big kicker?, the nutritionist at the end tells them they are short 250 calories per day. They quickly glance over this point as if it doesn't matter. You can live on a low calorie diet for a week, but normal families that have toddlers to run after, jobs to apply for, day labor jobs to work for rent etc can't afford to be weak and malnourished.

They point the finger at obesity and state how horrible it is. We all know that being overweight often correlates with diabetes and heart disease etc. Those will kill you...eventually.

being malnourished can lead to being lethargic and falling asleep at the wheel,  not wearing proper saftey gear at work etc. Being underweight is just as bad if not worse for your health. Organs fail, systems shut down and you can die in a matter of months.

Most people won't be on food stamps forever. It's a stop gap for hard times.  General advice about healthy eating bears mentioning in a discussion about food stamps but it is far from the first priority.",1409961600,4,2784,4.586693548387097
4671177,5,B005F3XV9Y,"A quick, eye-opening look at the challenge that 1/7 Americans face EVERY week, not just one week.  I'm doing my own challenge in response ... definitely worth understanding from the inside-out.",1409097600,,193,5.225806451612903
4671178,5,B005F3XV9Y,This was a very informative look into a serious problem here in America.  I really enjoyed it.,1405641600,,94,4.529411764705882
4671179,5,B005F3XV9Y,I enjoyed this film. I was disappointed that they claimed that you could not get flavor in your food on the food stamp budget. I disagree. I have seen it done many times. Places like Costco really help with that. This film is well-made and is definitely worth watching.,1399593600,,269,4.510204081632653

4671181,3,B005F3XV9Y,"While this documentary film was informative in many ways, it was not without a lot of flaws.  First all of us appreciate how challenging it is to feed a family on a limited budget in this present economy.  For those at the poverty level even more so.  But the way this couple went about trying to live on a food stamp budget of $1 per meal per day was unrealistic and not even practical.

Most people shop at a regular supermarket and people that are really on a budget go to discount supermarkets. Shira and Yoav went to a market and proceeded to stock up for a week.  What did they buy?  A bag of dried lentils, a bag of rice--one of which was a bulk item so that does save money.  Shira then went over to the discounted bin of apples and held up a bag.  Did she buy it? No.  Why?  Because it wasn't organic.  The same with butter--they bought organic butter which is about double the price of regular butter.  They bought some produce--lettuce, carrots, and then discovered they didn't have quite enough money to buy salad dressing.  But Shira is a nutritionist and gives cooking classes to children in elementary schools.  She doesn't know how to make salad dressing?  A small bottle of vinegar and some oil would cost about half of what a bottle of dressing costs.  At any rate, they went home to cook.  By the end of the week they were almost out of food, had a couple of dollars left, so where did they go?  To a trash bin because they needed bread---so they sifted through bags to find a loaf that wasn't moldy.

In the course of this film the Potashes visited a food bank, community gardens, schools, and farmers markets.  They also filmed people applying for food stamps and listened to their stories.  There was some good information from those episodes.  It was encouraging to note that many schools are striving to make breakfast and lunches more healthy and appealing to kids.  Depressed areas like Watts in Los Angeles and other inner cities now have farmers markets where EBT cards can be used.  I know that they are welcomed at the farmers markets where I live.

What was brought out in this documentary was that it's difficult to get good healthy food on food stamps or EBT cards.  That there are many areas in the country that are food scarce, like inner cities that are depressed and have a lot of crime as well as very rural communities in Appalachia that aren't very accessible.  People getting this benefit often buy high calorie, high fat, processed food products because they are cheaper.  One food distributor pointed out though, that people with basic cooking skills are able to shop wisely, buy nutritious food and make the EBT cards go further. Many communities and schools offer cooking lessons and give nutritional information to help people make good food choices.  In any event, to make this happen you won't save money by shopping at places like Whole Foods and buying organic which the Potashes advocate.",1389571200,4,2939,4.587332053742802
4671182,5,B005F3XV9Y,"Watched this with my four children ranging in age from 13 to 6.  We have a small tomato garden and will expand.  We have family and friends on Food Stamps, suffering with type 2 diabetes, because they eat what they can afford - cheap, overly processed food.  The mid-west sub-burbs needs organic farmer's markets and organic offerings, especially meat.  The children and I keep thinking of how we can start educating others and help them grow their own gardens - canning, fermenting vegetables - good old fashioned nutritious food.  Having recently converted to whole foods ourselves, we have a steep learning curve ahead.  First step - ditch the microwave.  This documentary will get you thinking about what you can do for yourself and others to change the way America eats, so that we may live WELL and prosper.",1389312000,,813,4.8478260869565215
4671183,5,B005F3XV9Y,"I loved this video and learned a lot from it.  Shira and Yoav both educate and challenge us in a very gentle and entertaining way, calling attention to the issues while avoiding finger-pointing or politicizing many of the issues surrounding food stamps.  This to me shows they are solution-focused versus ideology-focused.  How rare is that these days; maybe they should run for Congress!  I have worked in food pantries before, but was unaware of many of the obstacles low-income families run into that often prevent them from making healthy food choices, even if they want to.  I was also unaware of many of the model programs like Cooking With Kids and Project Eats that are out there. This video really made me think about how change might be possible in my own community.  Ironic that they have a garden (though even that got criticized by one reviewer), as I believe this video plants the seeds for change in such a beautiful way.  May they sprout and flourish!

I am disappointed that some reviewers were so critical and took their gentle style as flippant, somehow.  Or accused them of being yuppies.  Or invalidated their entire food stamp challenge because they clipped a few herbs from their garden.  Really???? It's just mean-spirited, in my opinion, to suggest that because they aren't really poor, they can't help poor people.  You don't have to be poor and hungry yourself to have compassion for people who are.  I am financially blessed and privileged to never have had to miss a meal in my life, but currently volunteer nutritional counseling medically uninsured people at a free clinic.  That does not make a great person, and maybe I could be doing more, but I am doing something.  Shira and Yoaz used their skills and talents in this video to do something, too.  And they have reached thousands of people with an inspiring message for change.  I will bet that a lot of the people who criticized this video are doing exactly nothing themselves to address any of the issues brought up in the video.  Or maybe they are getting farm subsidies, or this positive, non-blame game approach doesn't fit with their political views. Anyway, to anyone who has not seen the video, I encourage you to watch it and decide for yourself!  You won't be sorry you did.",1388793600,,2269,4.757033248081841
4671244,5,B005F3XV9Y,"The portrayal of the necessary choices being made and reactions of a couple on a daily basis were very realistic in the situation.  The only thing that couldn't be showcased in this film was the added tension that families actually on a food stamp budget face are the uncertainty of how long this will go on and the added stresses of how to pay the bills and afford some toilet paper.

My guess is that even this couple would be arguing about the food choices and quantities within a few weeks.",1386201600,,494,4.417582417582418
4671245,3,B005F3XV9Y,"The documentary features a pleasant couple attempting to live on a food stamp allotment for a week using healthy foods.  It includes other points of interest concerning the topic as well.  I feel it fell short because the couple bought a small amount of food, but included no menus or recipes of how they made it really stretch over a week.  It also was not clear how much they already had in their pantry to work with: such as seasonings, various condiments, etc.  For example: they served lentil soup to a guest at the end of the week, but other than lentils and a carrot it is not clear if what they'd purchased was the only ingredients included in the soup. They did show that you can eat healthy for a week, but they were hungry and it wasn't clear how long this could be sustained. It could have also included the recipes suggested by the government for people on the Thrifty Food plan, etc.",1386028800,,897,4.418181818181818
4671246,5,B005F3XV9Y,"I have done this.  I had a friend who had three kids, she was always running out of foodstamps before the end of the month so I took over the shopping and cooking.  Soon there was plenty to eat and even leftovers.  What I taught her was to buy from more than one store tracking the lower prices in the ads, buy store brands and generic as much as possible, and learn to cook from scratch.  The food companies make their biggest mark-up  on packaged food products, like spaghetti sauce, which is little more than diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and seasonings.  By the time I was done they had plenty to eat, a pantry full of food, and she requested they reduce her foodstamps by 1/4.  That was in the early 90's but I'd bet it can still be done.",1380931200,6,743,4.264285714285714
4671247,5,B005F3XV9Y,"This is a great film that examines the struggles people face every day while trying to eat a healthy and balanced diet on food stamps. People often assume that a healthy diet would be simple to achieve even on food stamps but the many hurdles of subsidizing, food deserts and strict income limits are just a few of the complications many run into. Add in a family and cheap unhealthy food and it's a recipe for disaster. The Potashes illustrate how it is possible to eat a healthy diet on food stamps but through watching their week long experiment we see just how difficult it truly is. I hope that someday soon there is a fix for this broken system rather than bandages like food pantries and dumpster diving.",1378684800,2,711,4.51937984496124
4671248,4,B005F3XV9Y,"One thing I really enjoyed about this particular documentary was the fact that the people who made it, despite their nutritional knowledge, could not get their calorie intake up high enough to function on a food stamp budget. That said, one reality I've noticed in my experience being on food stamps that they failed to mention is that farmers markets, in general, are far more expensive for produce than your average grocery store. Regardless of the ""benefits"" of organic produce, it's really bloody hard to live on a food stamp budget. One other thing that they fail to mention: food stamps are meant to augment a food budget, not comprise it in it's entirety. It's done on purpose. It even says so in the pamphlets.

Dr. Ann Wigmore was well known in my days for helping people that had very little. Get any book you can find on sprouting by Ann Wigmore or the Sproutman. Find someone that has a Moringa tree and eat from it or get the seeds and start growing them in your yard if you have a yard. You can buy seeds with food stamps! Help someone in need and spread the word about sprouting. It very well can save his or her life. Pets do very well on sprouts also. May God be with you on this journey of your life.

Mostly, the documentor was whiney and insecure while her easy going husband just went along with it. Very little was proven, except that people on food stamps generally opt for volume over nutrition. The presenters were able to eat healthy for week with food stamps, but were under nourished (too few calories), and spent an enormous amount of time preparing food. The big drama was dumpster diving and finding enough money to buy a challah bread for their Friday night Jewish meal. I really wish they had gone more in depth about the travesty of the food stamp budget, how it is nearly impossible to feed a family in a healthy way on this allotment and also provide some suggestions for families who are in a food stamp situation so that they can make healther choices with what they have to work with.",1360886400,11,949,4.588235294117647

It looks like a Whole Foods or Central Market - NOT somewhere people on food stamps would actually be able to afford). They constantly complain about how they aren't full and they can't afford desert. They even have friends over for dinner - as if you can afford to feed your friends when you can't even afford to feed yourslef.

4671289,2,B005F3XV9Y,The heart is in the right place as the filmmakers want to show how hard it is to have a healthy diet while loving on food stamps but the film's message is scattered jumping from the ills of mass produced foods to their inability to add cheese to their favorite meals.  Would rather watch Food Inc. or read an article on the issue rather than watch this.,1360454400,8,353,4.268656716417911
4671290,4,B005F3XV9Y,I really enjoyed this movie.  I am a mom who feeds her family healthy meals about 50% organic meals on under $3 per person per day.  I also volunteer at a food pantry and see alot of people strunggle with this.  I think mostly the problem is the no how.  Lots of people don't even know how to cook rice.  The other problem is alot of families may not have a way to cook the food.  Then alot of people beleive low fat is healthier than real food.  It is personally very sad to me because alot of people don't want to learn either.  I do wish they talked more about there struggles day to day in the movie.,1360022400,3,604,4.016806722689076
4671291,4,B005F3XV9Y,"It is sad that healthy foods are more difficult to buy with a food stamp budget. I do not have food stamps, but I do have a strict food budget and choose to eat healthy. It is difficult, but I know it will payoff in the long run.",1357689600,,229,3.7916666666666665
4671292,3,B005F3XV9Y,"I felt the whole movie was about vegitarianism. Eggs were the only animal proton they had in the diet. And they still came up 300 cal a day short of the 2000 they were supposed to eat a day. They followed a few food stamp people in the stores but took nothing away from what the people were telling them. Even though they ate on a food stamp budget they did not live on a low income for the week, where they would have to make other choices like gas for the car or pay the eletric bill. That would have been more of a quality challenge.",1354752000,5,536,4.018691588785047
4671293,3,B005F3XV9Y,"I like the decision not to compromise on their diet and lifestyle while struggling with the ""Food Stamps diet"". The documentary also points out the so so school lunches options which I think deserves attention.

The documentary states that the average food stamp recipient get a dollar worth of food stamps. The protagonists choose $1 food stamp supplement per meal. The premise is wrong because food stamps is distributed as a per need basis. They would need to provide some of they own money towards food. Richard in the movie who did not have a job and very low on money, he got approximately $2 per meal which is close to the full amount.

Why are lawmakers so unimaginative when it comes to cooking on the ""food stamps diet"". The best they can come up with is ramen and lentils. They just reverted to their college days.

I do believe we need better food choices especially for the poor.",1353974400,5,892,4.59748427672956

8469548,2,B005F3XV9Y,"Entertaining film although the premise is misguided.  They lived on food stamps.....food stamps are intended to SUPPLEMENT a food budget.  The entire film is based on misguided individuals.  I personally cannot remember the last time I entered a store that wasn't begging for applicants....but the film is full of people who can't find jobs.  Decent film, but reminds me of too many folks who are too lazy to work or too good to work at a fast food place or retail establishment who are begging for applicants.",1444521600,,510,4.827586206896552
8469549,5,B005F3XV9Y,"First off, let's settle this once and for all: they did NOT shop at Whole Foods!  I live in a nearby city and know Berkeley well.  The couple shopped at Berkeley Bowl, a local supermarket chain that is by no means as pricey as WF and that has a lot of bulk options (something I'd want on a tight budget so I wouldn't have to buy more than I need).  The major grocery chain in the area is Safeway but all three in the city of Berkeley are in high income neighborhoods and I doubt they would have been more affordable.  BB is in a working class to middle income area, on major bus lines and is relied upon by people of all income levels.

Second, the purpose of this documentary is not to give you recipes or to show you how to get the most food possible or the least money.  It's not a cooking show.  It's also not for the film makers to put themselves in the worst possible position and see if they could survive.  Of course there are people who don't have the same resources they do, but there was nothing they cooked that required anything more than a basic kitchen and equipment, so let's not nitpick about that, please (yes, they used herbs from their garden, but anyone with a sunny windowsill can grow herbs in a pot with minimal effort.  And if you don't have them, you go without, what's the big deal?).  The purpose of the film is to see *how healthfully* you can eat on a foodstamp budget.  OF COURSE it's difficult; that's why it's a challenge.

It's easy to nitpick this film if you think that it's acceptable for poor people to have to eat the cheapest most highly processed crap just to get by.  It's easy to nitpick if you think that poor people don't deserve to or don't want to eat healthy, affordable and yes, organic, foods.  It's easy to nitpick if you think that just because you're poor, you shouldn't be able to entertain friends with a meal.  I'm much more financially secure now but I've been poor.  There were plenty of weeks when the goal was just to buy enough of whatever I could to keep hunger at bay that I could also stuff down on the run between two jobs.  Sure, you can do it with ramen noodles, pasta, cheap hamburger and peanut butter sandwiches, with the occasional banana or apple or bag of frozen veg, but is that the best we should be able to hope for?  I wanted more and I'm sure plenty of others do, too.  There's nothing wrong with that.

The very thing many are criticizing about this film are the points that need to be made about the absurdity of the food stamp system.  If someone with the time, resources, knowledge and skills of the film makers can barely scrape by for a week on this budget, how do we expect the less fortunate to do it?  But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't strive for something better.  It is because of the efforts of people interested in food justice - people like the film makers - that we have things like farmers markets that take food stamps and food banks that give out fresh produce.  It is because people raise awareness and demand something better that many people who want it, have better access to healthier foods, though, admittedly, we still have a very long way to go.  We can accept the status quo (and the multitude of expensive health problems that go with it) and criticize those who do not adhere to it, or we can thank the film makers for continuing to raise awareness of the limitations of the current food systems and for doing something concrete to try to make a difference.  I choose the latter.  I think the Potashes did a great job.  I found them relatable and engaging and it was enlightening to see how much they were able to do with so little (if you watch the credits you'll see everything they bought with the prices and all the meals they were able to make) but to still see how difficult it was.  I would watch another film by this couple.",1443916800,5,3845,4.323570432357044

8469552,5,B005F3XV9Y,"Food Stamped was an informative look into the life of an educator and her partner who lived on a food stamp budget of $1 per meal, per person for one week. (Released in 2011).  She teaches children how to make healthy meals using fruits and vegetables and was wondering if it was possible for her students families to purchase these ingredients on a food stamp budget.

Some interesting statistics from the movie included that the maximum amount given to a family of 2 is $75 a week but most families of 2 receive $40-$50 a week.  They also went shopping with Richard who is single and receives $176 for a month. They said this was the high end and that $96 is the average for a single person.  Over 40% of food stamp recipients are white.

The film puts the blame for unhealthy food being cheaper than fruits and vegetables squarely on the farm bill.  This is because the foods that are subsidized are grains used for high fructose corn syrup and feeding livestock.

They talked with some school districts about their lunch programs. The breakfast program gets popular brands of sugary cereals but the ones sold to the schools are lower sugar formulations.  This film did not villainize the school lunch program, at least at the local high school where they cook their own food.  Admittedly the elementary is served pre-packaged foods.

There were interviews taken at a local farmers market as well.  These brought up the fact that at most farmers markets you can use your EBT (SNAP) funds.

They had a registered dietitian review what they ate after the challenge. They were lacking in calories.  The dietitian said that the aim should be for 60% of your calories to come from carbohydrates and that you should consume 5 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. They ate vegetables with every meal but were still lacking in their intake of fruits and vegetables.

One thing that did not seem cheap about their budget was that they did their shopping at a Whole Foods.  They used the bulk bins for their beans, rice, and lentils. You could tell that they were using fresh ground peanut butter.  Most of their food items were organic.  They did mention The Dirty Dozen which is a list that can be found by Googling that shows the 12 fruits and vegetables that are contaminated with pesticides. When your budget can afford it these are the ones you should buy organic.  It includes a lot of tree fruits, bell peppers, spinach, potatoes, and lettuce.

There were interviews with Congressmen and Women who had previously done a one week food stamps challenge. These are some of the same people shown in A Place At The Table.  One of the Congressmen brought up a point that sums up A Place At The Table and Food Stamped nicely. He said that we have all the resources, knowledge and infrastructure to solve hunger. The only thing we don't have is the political will.

I enjoyed this documentary because it had interviews with many different people from different organizations in the community.  It stressed the importance of fruits and vegetables.  It was entertaining and informative.  My only disagreement with the film is that I do not believe in getting 60% of my calories from carbohydrates.",1430092800,,3192,4.70990990990991
