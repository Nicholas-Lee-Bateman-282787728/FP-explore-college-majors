For me I was unable to enjoy this show after wanting it for so long. A better copy might come out in the future. Picture quality was very good though. If you don't need the subtitles, then this might be good for you. I can't say anything about the story line as I didn't watch it. I hope this is helpful to you",1522800000,,438,3.977272727272727
8653711,4,B00JSA0CHO,"There is a certain predictability in many Taiwanese romantic dramas that hearkens back to Hollywood's golden years of boy-meets-girl boy-loses-girl concluding with boy-marries-girl. In DEJA VU, director Wang Ming Tai adds to this reliable staple an element not often found in T-dramas--reference to the supernatural. Xu Hai Lin (Mandy Wei) is the lead female who loves Lu Xi Wei (Yao Yuan Hao) and soon carries his child. Tragedy strikes when Lu Xi Wei is killed in a car crash that causes her to miscarry. She winds up in a limbo dimension where a bearded God figure called Sage advises her that he can restore Lu Xi Wei to life but at a fearful cost. Upon awakening, he will no longer remember his past life with her. She is tasked with rebuilding a love that does not now exist in this revised reality. Complicating matters is that Lu Xi Wei is now engaged to Xu Hai Lin's sister, who reveals a murderous side as she schemes relentlessly to prevent Xu Hai Lin from restoring a love that was lost in the previous reality.

  Taiwanese audiences are thoroughly familiar with the social conventions, stereotypes, morality, and family relations that are intricately intertwined with the plot. Step sisters, as in any of Grimm's fairy tales, are wicked. Both leads have two types of sidekicks, one goofy and others well-meaning. The female lead must weep excessively in every other scene. The male lead must indulge in self-analytical monologues as counterpoint to this weeping. Hospital scenes are similarly ubiquitous as the female lead suffers from non-stop injury but nevertheless stages a complete recovery--until the next. Actors tend to stand around and look pensively in mirrors for interminable periods of time. And annoyingly, whenever two characters engage in conversation, a third appears from a doorway to overhear critical details, thus precipitating yet another crisis. Now all of these conventions might grate on the perspective of a Western viewer, but it is an injustice to judge a Taiwanese film that resonates for its intended audience even if a foreign audience may need to view several dramas with a similar set of themes and conventions to reorient so as to feel a similar resonance. DJ VU has its leads interact with believable chemistry as each has to traverse a bewilderingly confused path of redirected love with a supernatural Sage as a conveneiently appearing semi-deity forcing the leads to question their depths of convictions. It is the chemistry between the leads that makes this film work.",1466467200,,2521,5.040767386091127
