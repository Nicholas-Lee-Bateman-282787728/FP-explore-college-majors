6403075,5,B00K62YF80,"This movie is a must watch for horror movie fans. It is subtitled in English, but the movie is just so good that didn't even bother me. This is a new twist on the horror genre and I loved it, completely mind blown in the end so many good twists and turns....highly recommend watching this one.",1415923200,10,293,4.25
6403076,5,B00K62YF80,"This isn't a horror movie, more like a Supernatural Thriller, but it's excellent! If you have seen/enjoyed ""The Orphanage"", ""The Devil's Backbone"" or ""Dorm"", you will like this one. Don't worry if things are disjointed or confusing at first, as it all comes together as the movie progresses. Great plot with some spooky happenings along with the mystery, and like a lot of Latin horror there is tragedy and a much deeper story than  just superficial scares. Highly recommended!",1415664000,5,477,5.037974683544304
6403077,5,B00K62YF80,"Wow... I mean... WOW... This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. A ghost story that's not really a ghost story. I know, I know... but I don't want to ruin it for anyone. This movie will scare you and will also break your heart.

I would like to point out that, although the editorial notes say that this movie is a Region A/1 Blu-ray disc, the notes on back of the movie do not indicate that. Also, the notes say that this movie is in PAL format. However, I played it on my Playstation 3 and it played with no problems whatsoever. The movie is subtitled, as well. I sure hope this movie makes it onto U.S. distribution because it is that damn good.",1412294400,9,654,4.149606299212598

I watched this one with a genius (high IQ score) and even she was surprised; she usually figures out the plot within the first fifteen minutes of a horror movie (kinda ruined the Canal for me last time that we watched a movie together) but not this one.

But if you enjoy a good story, appreciate the suspense while it unfolds, and delight in an unexpected ending--watch this movie.

This movie is about a house built over a specific area in the world. The story alludes the original owner specifically chose this location. This movie deals with time travel and how the times converge on one specific day and at a specific time. As the main character figures this out, it puts in motion all of the choices and actions she takes to get to the final scene.

But this one caught my attention and the beginning was good enough that I stayed with it. And man am I glad! This took so many twists and turns that I had no clue where it was going. And for me, that's saying a lot. I'm kinda like Sherlock Holmes when it comes to movies. I just seem to know almost from the beginning what's going to happen and who is doing what. Not this time (no pun intended). Even if you aren't into foreign films, make an exception for this one. The woman's makeup isn't that good at a certain point which you'll see for yourself but that, by no means, takes away from the movie. Enjoy!",1500681600,,812,4.279220779220779

Once you get over the implausibility of the premise, this starts out as a serviceable but unremarkable haunted house movie.  However, it really comes to life in the third act, when the true nature of what has occurred has been revealed.  Similar to the The Sixth Sense, the gradual realization of what is happening actually bleeds the horror out of the film, while simultaneously heightening the interest level and giving it some real emotional heft.  Once the final credits roll, you might question its categorization as a horror film, but it is certainly an effective thriller.  Billed as Venezuelas first horror film, it was a huge hit in that country.",1469145600,,901,4.933774834437086

6403111,5,B00K62YF80,"This is an excellent mystery about which not enough good can be spoken without giving too much away regarding the premise.

The key is the house itself which has the ability to capture in its twisted web the viewer as well as those characters who enter it in order to solve a mystery taking place in two time periods., The ending will either have you groaning in confusion or smiling in satisfaction because, dare I say it without sounding like a snob, it depends on how energetic you are in exercising your gray matter. If you like puzzles, you will love this. If you like a challenge and feel good when you solve a mystery, you will love this. If you like suspense in a convoluted story without needless gore, you will love this.

I am coming to admire those films that I have lately been viewing that come from south of the border. I have often admired Asian films and Italian films (yes, even those ghallo films by Argento and Fulci), but I am new to the appreciation of Hispanic and Latino films.

6403114,4,B00K62YF80,"This is a beautiful nonlinear movie that owes more to Memento than it does to most of the other house movies. It's so well-crafted that even apparent one-off comments come back into play by the end of the story which resonated, for me, with the consequences of choices made.

This is not outright horror, though there are some scarifying moments and much creeptasticness. But it's a beautiful, atmospheric movie about family connections and deep loss and maybe those are horrifying enough.",1446422400,,489,5.037037037037037

6403129,5,B00K62YF80,"The House At The End Of Time is a atmospheric blended genre film both elevated and stylish. The film combines both the science fiction concepts of time warp and temporal rift with elements of paranormal and haunting illusionism. The House At The End Of Time offers a gothic nightmare to rival any horror or fantasy created by some of Latin Americas more notable directors/storytellers.

Hidalgo is brilliant in his direction of this truly horrific situation. The acting is an even-paced, suspenseful display of despair, tension, and downright creepy character development. One that in the end gives us a true happy ending fitting a nightmare. It is a dark, theatrical foray of relationships, second chances, and tragedy embraced by heavy, atmospheric paranormal scenarios that keep this doomed family on the edge of hopelessness.

6403133,4,B00K62YF80,"A cerebral house movie that bends time, genres, reality and expectations.  Venezuelas #1 thriller of all time is truly a winner.  Ive seen my share of house movies and this one certainly stands out.  House Hunting (2013) and Silent House (2011) utilize effective means of disorienting viewers creating a sense of tension and unease.  Even Oculus (2014) serves as a house movie in the same manner despite its focus on an evil mirror.

I recently had the pleasure of viewing this Venezuelan thriller when my girlfriend stumbled across it on Netflix.  Being adventurous about trying new horror movies completely unknown to usa quality I absolutely adore about her--she did some research and it turns out that this movie was actually a pretty big deal in Venezuela.  Evidently it ranks as the highest grossing thriller (in Venezuela) of all time, selling 700,000 tickets during its 41 week run at the box officewhich means that 1 out of every 42 people in the entire country saw this in theaters!  A horror movie!  Thats impressive.  That would be about a $60 million box office gross if 1 in 42 people in the United States saw a movie assuming an $8 ticket (which may be on the low side).  Not bad for first time writer, producer, editor and director Alejandro Hidalgo!

But even still, I somehow remained skeptical.  After all, Venezuela is a country one-tenth the size of the United States with about 30 million people and loads of tropical forests.  I questioned whether theyve made enough thrillers (or movies in general) for me to be impressed with their highest grossing thriller of all time.  But, being adventurous myself, I submitted to my girlfriends desire to see this figuring we can just watch something else if its no good.  Lets just say my expectations were very wrongand hers were right.

Anyway, at its start I had low expectations.  But, I do like a good house movie and the disorienting devices that often accompany them like protean or even labyrinthine architecture and plays on time (flashbacks, haunting visions of the past, actual time lapses).  And a good house movie is exactly what we got!  However, this house movie is far from being cut from the typical mold.  This is neither scarefest nor gorefest.  This is something so much deeper, so much creepier, so much more cerebral.

The House at the End of Time opens on an ill-fated evening set 30 years in the past when Dulce is convicted of the murder of her husband and missing son.  Then we move to present day, after an elderly Dulce has served 30 years in prison and is returned to her home to serve the remainder of her life under house arrest.  Almost as quickly as she gets home and sits down, she is visited by a priest who tries to help her remember exactly what happened that night 30 years ago.

The pacing was not ideal, often alternating between long scenes of kids playing and intense scenes of marital disorder during the first half of the film.  We also alternate between scenes from the past and scenes from the present as elderly Dulce wanders her home and begins to remember moresome of which she never recalled even 30 years ago.  At times, she seems to be hallucinating her present day elderly self into these scenes from the past.  But are they hallucinations caused by the house, are they suppressed memories, perhaps they're her own delusionsor is it all something else?  I even found myself questioning if wed discover some manner of possession had occurred, or some other form of evil.  Is this house movie or a ghost story?  Is Dulce a ghost!?!?!  Is Dulce guilty or innocent of her familys murder?  Is this house her own personal Hell where she relives visions of her past sins?  Why is this priest interested in helping her solve the mystery?  So many questionsits easy to get carried away.  I wanted answers and so did Dulce (and so did my girlfriend LOL), and none of us cared what it wasas long as we had an answer.

Now, please make no mistake and please distrust any reviewers who call this film one of the most scary movies of whatever.  There are a few effective jumpscare moments, but this movie is more about a steady atmosphere of fear, tension, anticipation and disorientation.  Writer/director Alejandro Hidalgo succeeded in creating a consistently creepy, engaging slow-burn that kept me watching the shadows for evil and thinking at the same time, trying to solve the time-based mystery therein.  Without spoiling anything, Ill reveal that time is played upon much as it is in Oculus, such that we don't really know what is the present and what is the pastor futureor are two times meeting one another somehow or even. you get the idea.

Its also easy to discount movies of apparently low budget.  This film has the complicated story of a book, looks like someone filmed a play (with a huge set and special effects), and feels like a horror-drama-mystery telenovela.

During the third act of the film some things will make sense, others things maybe not so clearly.  Just be advised that this film will end up proving that its a lot more clever than you think it is.  Its story is elaborate to the point that I find no borrowed components from other stories.  No.  This story is unique and, much like its successor Oculus, it thrives on the audiences fear of the unknown and things that may or may not be revealed.

This film was eerie, unpredictable, disorienting, and it pleasantly surprised me.  Even though its a Spanish language film subtitled in English, the pace is casual enough that reading along will not compromise you're ability to immerse yourself in the story and its chilling atmosphere.

Dont be intimidated by subtitles.  Dont shy away from this foreign movie.  Please, do give this a chance.",1425945600,6,5727,4.732323232323233

There are definite scares but they are derived from the suspense of the unknown.  Not in your face CGI or blood and gore in excess . . . the typical ""flash"" that American horror film has become synonymous with.  Instead, there is substance here.  Mainly, a good story.  And THAT makes a movie.  For those who want to know more, this is a ghost story of sorts.  A haunted house story of sorts.  But not typical of either.  It's similar to THE OTHERS in that you begin to understand what's going on as the movie progresses.  I didn't even mind that the film was not in English and I had to read the caption.

I think those reviews were left by the impatient, and perhaps unappreciative of this movie's both subtle and intense depth. This movie is described as fitting into many genres, including suspense and horror, but is so much more than that. I would more accurately describe this movie as a suspenseful supernatural drama. That being said, it is a beautifully haunting tale. It has some scary and ominous moments throughout, but as it unfolds you realize that it is all part of a very touching story that can only be told through the supernatural paradigm. There are revelations throughout the movie that keep your mind active and calculating which events happened when. This gives the film an almost ""huh""? feeling as you try to figure out what's happening, similar to watching the Matrix series. If you can hang on long enough to the end, you can finally see the whole story from the top of the mountain. It's definitely worth watching at least once.",1425168000,,1053,4.728260869565218

I just finished watching 3 minutes ago and decided to write a review to replace the conversation with friends. There will be a few things that make you want to rewind and review.

6403155,3,B00K62YF80,"A charming yet ineffectual horror movie about a woman released after spending thirty years in prison for the death of her husband and son. She goes back to live at the house where it all happened. There's a strong element of time travel in this movie, something I'm really not a fan of because it's so predictable when it's not paradoxical. My absolute least favorite part of the movie happens early on, when cute and whimsical music plays as a bunch of boys fill water balloons with their own urine and throw it at some poor guy for no reason. How delightful those little scamps are! As a horror, the movie is weak in scares and throws nothing new your way. It works more as a family drama, a paranormal mystery perhaps. In that regard it reminds me a bit of The Devil's Backbone, another Spanish-language horror film, but by famed director Guillermo del Toro.

6403160,4,B00K62YF80,"I had been waiting for this film to release on Video on Demand formats ever since its many positive reviews after debuting (in the US) at the Frightfest Film Festival earlier this year.  This marked my first time viewing a Venezuelan horror film, and pardon my ignorance but I was unaware that Venezuela put out horror films to begin with.  Going into this flick I was expecting a supernatural tale heavy in ghosts and paranormal activity, but what I was given turned out to be so much more than that.  The House at the End of Time uses its supernatural elements in a manner I was not expecting, which is partly my fault because I expected the usual cliches seen in other Spanish language horror films.  What we are given here is an emotionally absorbed story that moonlights as a typical spookfest, excelling at both, and making this one of my favorite horror films of 2014.

Thirty years ago Dulce suffered the effects of a supernatural presence that left her husband dead.  Convicted of his murder, she has been released to spend her remaining days in her old home, where she will once again face the forces that haunted her thirty years prior.

The opening sequences takes nearly seven minutes to complete, and it will leave you sucked in for everything else writer/director Alejandro Hidalgo has to offer.  To begin the film the older, post-thirty-year-incarcerated Dulce is released from prison and reluctantly brought to her home.  It is obvious that she is uneasy about returning to the location of such despair, and it is also obvious that the demons, which she referred to as intruders have been waiting for her.  With the unsolicited help of a local priest who took an interest to the strange circumstances behind the murder, she begins to piece together what exactly happened that night, and how she can fix the past.  I mentioned before that this is much more than a supernatural film.  Without giving too much away I will say that the story uses time in a very unique manner.  For the first two acts you will likely be confused about what is going on, but the third act ties everything together in what I can only describe as a beautiful manner.

So is this even a horror film?  Heck yes it is.  The first act plays off like the traditional haunted house flick, but as the story progresses it loses that element and ventures into a time / reality-bending theme that had me glued to the screen.  We are still provided scares during this progression, but keep in mind they are of a different nature.  It would be safe for me to say that the horror is toned down a bit after the first act, but the tension remains high and that should do enough to keep you on edge.  I keep saying it, but this story is more than what it appears to be.  It is an emotional film as much as it is a ghost flick, and to be honest this is one of the few genre films to make me genuinely sad.  I would call this a good kind of sad, but nonethelessits not often a flick leaves me feeling this way.  Bonus points for the unique experience.

Alejandro Hidalgos direction is equally as good as his story.  From the get-go he portrayed this like the creepy paranormal tale this was disguised as, giving me chills with even the simplest of scares.  Good execution will do that.  He employs amazing atmosphere and a creepy home to sell the spooks and keep the tension high, and I believe this visual appeal helped keep my attention during the films slightly confusing (eventually not confusing) moments.  The actors deliver solid performances too, making this an all-around great film from a first-time filmmaker in a country not known for horror films.

Overall, The House at the End of Time is one of my favorite flicks of 2014 and an experience I highly suggest to you.  Watch, pay attention, and youll enjoy.",1418515200,7,3794,4.562776957163958

6403162,3,B00K62YF80,"More drama than horror, the house before time centers on a woman accused of murdering her husband and her child thirty years ago. She is released back into the same home where the murders occurred to live out the remaining of her sentence. She is bitter, she has lost her faith, and upon returning to the home, she is besieged with ghosts similar to the ones she saw thirty years ago.

A kindly priests visits her - he doesn't believe that a mother could take the life of her children - and through the stories she shares (via flashbacks) we learn what really happened that fateful night.

There are only a handful of scares in the house. But the old woman's emotions are palpable and it is interesting to watch how things unfold. For me, the ending was only mildly satisfying, which is why the 3 stars instead of 4.  Nevertheless, I found the entire story enjoyable enough. I wouldn't suggest buying the house. You know how it is with real estate ... location, location, location ... but overall it's worth spending a couple hours in the house at the end of time.",1418515200,3,1064,4.5025906735751295

6403169,5,B00K62YF80,"As one who grew up on the Universal Classics and one that has seen well over 2,000 horror movies, I tip my hat off to the efforts done here. This film was nothing short of fantastic. There are certain individuals that are attempting to knock it down a notch by claiming that it's not ""true horror"". That all depends on how you define the genre of horror. This film is definitely a horror film and is DEFINITELY worth a watch. Perhaps those that enjoy major cinematic releases to the vein of ""Ouija"" , ""Devil's Due"", etc. won't appreciate this film because it lacks a bevy of ""special effects"". Unfortunately for those, they will miss out on a MASTERFUL work of art. This film, similar to the classics of old, relies heavily on atmosphere, fantastic acting, and a marvelous story line.

The premise goes like this

Young Dulce is put away for many years after being found guilty of killing her husband. The description is incorrect. She is not accused of murdering TWO children, rather simply of murdering her one surviving child and her husband. After serving time, she returns to the home-which, coincidentally, was the scene of the crime that put her away. With the aid of the town priest, it is her never ending goal to find out what became of her son and to find out exactly what all the seemingly malevolent and haunting experiences that are occurring amount to. This is a film that is heavy on story line and ties what occurs from the very first frames all the way to the end of this masterpiece. I wish this film were available in higher quality, perhaps as high as 1080p, as the atmosphere and the gorgeous haunted house should be given the due justice they deserve in a high rendered picture. Nevertheless, buy this film. Support good horror movies. They're a dying breed.",1417305600,4,1781,4.615141955835962

6403172,4,B00K62YF80,"The House at the End of Time is a suspenseful, well constructed horror film from writer/director Alejandro Hidalgo. Thirty years ago, young mother Dulce (Ruddy Rodriguez) was accused of murdering her husband and two children in their home. Despite her pleas that a malevolent force in the house was responsible for the killings, Dulce was sentenced to the maximum penalty of imprisonment.

As part of her sentence, Dulce is sent back to her old home and the scene of the crime under house arrest, where shes forced to confront the horrifying memory of what happened there. But this time, shes determined to unravel the mystery that has haunted her for so long and, with the help of a local priest, give both her loved ones and her own spirits their much-needed peace

Director Hidalgo makes creepy use of sound to both scare us and ignite curiosity. The movie virtually drips with atmosphere and takes its time to build suspense. The movie will have you looking over your shoulder. Keep the lights on when you watch!
