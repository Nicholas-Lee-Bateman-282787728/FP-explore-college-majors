4503114,5,B004YOEDO2,"For the price you can't beat this 4 episode DVD of classic WML shows. In addition the show with Lucille Ball has long been considered a ""Lost"" episode. It is not in the GSN library.",1227830400,3,181,4.2

4503116,5,B004YOEDO2,"I watched this program when I was a boy growing up in New York City, and enjoyed it immensely. Because it was broadcast at 10:30 p.m. (EST) on Sunday, it marked the end of the weekend and a return to the drudgery of school, so it was a semi-sweet event.

A panel of four usually witty, clever well-known figures in entertainment and publishing tried to guess the occupations of mostly unassuming guests. During the featured part of the program, the panel was blindfolded as they tried to take a stab at the identity of a celebrity.

Much of the credit for the program's success must go to moderator John Daly, a thoughtful and very articulate former news broadcaster who showed considerable finesse in helping his guests determine whether they should give a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer to the panelists' questions.

Indeed, Daly's facility with rephrasing answers was often as funny as the panelists' questions themselves.

The disc contains four half-hour shows, complete with commercials. I marveled at Remington Rand's commercial for its UNIVAC computer, which, athough it filled a large room, was far less powerful than one of today's typical PCs.

A lot of fun and highly recommended. I eagerly await additional discs in the series",1225238400,11,1229,4.946601941747573
4503117,5,B004YOEDO2,"The original ""What's My Line"" from 1950-1967 is a true blue classic. I'm currently 38, and became a big fan watching it on GSN during ""Black and White Overnight"", thankfully the show still continues to air nightly.

The panelists of Bennett Cerf, Arlene Francis, Dorothy Kilgallen, and host John Charles Daly with Steve Allen (he did guest spots) were true professionals. This panel show of four had to guess the occupations of their guests who all had various jobs in many different fields by asking a series of questions to them. When a celebrity guest came by for their weekly visit, the panel had to wear blindfolds then try and figure out who they were; all the while the famous mystery guest would disguise his or her voice.

This show asked the famous phrase started by Steve Allen ""Is it bigger than a bread box?"" in regards to a product to help get the line of the guest. The gang of four had class, wit and sophistication sadly lacking in much TV today and I would say it's one of my favorite all time shows, my husband even watches this with me. My favorite panelist is Bennett Cerf..... A 5 star show for sure!

Updated 08-08-08: We received the DVD via Amazon and it's actually really good. There are only four shows on here with Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz (one or the other or both) doing guest appearances in three episodes so I'm enjoying it. The original commercials from the 50's broadcast on here are a riot. I love the first episode when Steve Allen was trying to guess the occupation of the man who sells maternity wear - Dorothy Kilgallen was expecting at the time. Very funny!

PS My only suggestion would be to have the whole series out on DVD. But I'll take the 4 episodes for now.

Update April 9/08 - GSN is no longer airing this classic show on its nightly schedule. I can only hope that it will reconsider as ""What's My Line"" is a classy one of a kind show.",1217548800,2,1885,4.420749279538905
4503118,5,B004YOEDO2,"""What's My Line"" was part of a now extinct genre of TV known as "" Panel Shows"", where a panal of humans would have to guess something. Along with ""I've Got a Secret"", ""The Match Game"" (60's Version), and ""Public Prosecutor"", these type of programs were popular during the 50's and 60's. In this show, The Panel must guess the occupation of the contestants. It's very entertaining. Plus there are celebrity guests: In the 4 episodes on this DVD, Lucille Ball & Desi Arnaz, Kim Novak, Randolph Churchill appear. These episodes are complete with orginal commercials, and are taken from good quality ""Kinescope"" copies.
If you enjoy Classic Game Shows, this DVD is worth getting. Both me and my parents enjoyed this DVD.",1207785600,21,716,4.829268292682927
8448642,4,B004YOEDO2,"I don't know why many of the reviews here refer to What's My Line. This item, as listed, contains four episodes of Stump the Stars from 1963.
It's fun, although for me, not as much fun as What's My Line and I've Got a Secret. I purchased it primarily because I like Sebastian Cabot. Richard Long, and Ross Martin.
Still, the games are very difficult and the stars are remarkably good at charades. They've clearly had a great deal of practice at this. As it turns out, Michael Landon is particularly good (at least in the one game in which he was the performer).",1501459200,,561,4.403846153846154

8448647,5,B004YOEDO2,"What's My Line was a fun and sophisticated TV show in its day and this collection of shows backs that up. The gentle but firm host John Daly, and the ""regulars"" all added to the fun and rhythm of the show. The last show features early panelist Hal Block, who was funny but whose humor didn't fit in with the sophisticated tempo of the others. Steve Allen was a much better fit on the panel. His humor, Bennett's business smarts, Arlene's sophistication and Dorothy's show biz ""in the know"" helped make this show a Sunday night staple for 17 years. I enjoy it more now that the Game Show Network has stopped airing What's My Line.",1255910400,,629,4.431034482758621

8448651,5,B004YOEDO2,"but I was not born. I love watching them on GSN each night.

The box does not mention that it mostly has episodes with Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. I was hoping it was the first episodes or the one with Jules Montenier. The commercials were interesting-most were Remington Rand/univac and a few Stopette. The 05 February 1956 episode is one of the best on the disk (4 episodes on the disk).
