8220973,4,B000W1V4UW,"The story grabs your interest from the beginning when we see an old man(Bruno) stalking a young woman(Monica). He claims to be her grandfatner, she thinks he's confused or crazy. She is a Kindergarten teacher and suddenly realizes that she does not remember anything about her past before imigrating to Spain from Argentina as a child. All she knows is that her father(Ernesto) is a businessman who left Argentina because of the Revolution and of course loves her mother(Ines) very much. But when she sees her father's friends and then her father accused and on trial for past war crimes, she agrees to finally meet with the old man(Bruno), if only to ask him to drop the charges against her parents.  Only the first part is a mystery, but soon after the viewer sees more and more evidence against her parents. Melodramatic of course but interesting for the student of that period in Latin American History.",1317600000,,907,4.814102564102564
