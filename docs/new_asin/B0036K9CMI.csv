I want the Killers, Gilda, Asphalt Jungle, Out of the Past and Murder My Sweet to add on my movie collections.",1399334400,2,275,4.2075471698113205
8390092,1,B0036K9CMI,"There really isn't much else to say. The films are great, but they have not been digitally remastered. Very disappointing. Buy the Film Noir Classic Collections by Warner instead.",1284595200,15,179,5.206896551724138
8390093,1,B0036K9CMI,"Many of these films are available in studio and restored releases ( The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, The Stranger, Scarlet Street & I believe DOA). There is no known ""good"" print of Killer Bait, aka Too Late for Tears, to my knowledge. At this price, do your research carefully, as many of these titles from the public domain are nearly unwatchable. Buyer beware, or buy the Restored/Studio releases for a satisfying viewing experience.",1272153600,45,437,4.918918918918919
8390094,5,B0036K9CMI,"All of the films in this collection are great.  Orson Welles's ""The Stranger"" is beyond amazing and my favorite.  It's right out of Inglorious Basterds.  Edward G. Robinson is a Nazi hunter who frees a war criminal in order to follow him to find the hiding place of a Nazi mastermind played by Welles.  It's funny and thrilling, and there are images that really stick with you.  The ending scene atop the clock tower gives new meaning to ""Deus Ex Machina.""  Also, it has the same sense of fun and Wellesian devilry you see in later films like ""F for Fake.""

I highly recommend this collection, and especially ""The Stranger.""",1269561600,4,624,4.618181818181818
