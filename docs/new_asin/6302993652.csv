530242,5,6302993652,"Interestingly, like a few other reviewers, this story also was my very first foray into Who-dom, at a time when in the remaining years of the '70s, all the post-Star Wars productions were swelling with enormous production costs, but more and more devoid of originality or interesting stories were being pushed out. Just changing the channel one Saturday afternoon on PBS and behold: What a marvelous inventive story of traveling back to Italy and battling evil intergalactic entities..?

Arguably, this is basically Doctor Who at his finest and most lavish production values, and this story doesn't disappoint.  I agree the ending could have been a bit more climatic, but I'm still scratching my head as to why this story hasn't been put on DVD yet..! It's much better than most of the current contenders and I'm hoping it'll be next, along with 'Face of Evil' and 'Seeds of Doom', more classic Tom Baker.",1215388800,,905,4.908496732026144
530243,5,6302993652,"This is supposed to be a bad episode? Are you kidding me? This classic boasts not one but two of the better villains ever to twirl their mustaches on ""Dr. Who"" -- a pretty impressive statement considering this is the show that produced Davros, Dr. Soren, Weng-Chiang aka Magnus Greel, Harrison Chase, Sutekh, and innuerable other bad boys who just want to crush, kill, and destroy. Don't believe me? Pop the tape in and watch the insufferably smug and self-centered Count Frederico growl to his flunky, ""By morning I want to see Guiliano's liver fed to the dogs.""

But I'm getting ahead of myself. ""Masque"" is about a malevolent and rather wierd being called the Mandragora Helix, that thumbs a ride on the Tardis to 15th Century Italy and once there, decides to avert the Rennaisance and trap mankind in the Dark Ages forever. Its motive? Uh, well, it doesn't like mankind. Fears it will expand across the galaxy. That sort of thing. Really, who cares? The Helix is not really a villain, it's what writers call a ""maguffin"" -- an obvious plot device designed to set a chain of events in motion.

The chain is this: San Martino's old ruler has just passed away under mysterious circumstances. The new duke (Guilano) suspects his scheming uncle Frederico and his sinister fortune-telling sidekick, Hironimous, of the murder. He also suspects he's next on the list, and he's right. But Hironimous is playing a double game: not only is he working for Frederico, he's also secretly the leader of a nasty pagan cult that favors masks, robes, and ritual sacrifice (and in fairness, who doesn't?). Naturally, this gets him the favorable attention of the Helix, which decides to use him and his cult as its servants on earth.

Having brought the Helix to earth (oops, sorry about all the horrible deaths) Tom Baker's Doctor (in very fine and cheeky form) does his best to frustrate the count's ambitions, unravel Hironimous' connection to the cult, and prevent the Helix from wiping out the men who will bring humanity out of the Dark Ages. It's really the least he can do, considering. Liz Sladen's Sarah gets captured, hypnotized and nearly sacrificed more than usual, but at the same time gets to enjoy a sort of low-key, G-rated flirtation with Guilano, which makes this one of the few episodes ever that aknowledged that yes, some of the Doc's sidekicks were cute and yes, boys might be attracted to them.

What makes ""Masque"" so enjoyable in my book is the excellent costume and sey design, the large number of scenes shot outdoors (instead of the cramped, overlit, fake-looking sets that the show was condemned to in the last years of Baker's run as Doctor), the cockney accents of the Italian guards (""I ain't goin' do'wn 'ere Givoni, not fer awl th'gold in Rome""), and the truly wonderful villains (I wish I could remember the names of the actors; but the guy who plays Hironimous also showed up in the Jeremy Brett Sherlock Homes episode ""The Crooked Man"" as well, the Crooked Man). I'm well aware that the story has some rather large holes and more than its share of maguffins, but I also am paralyzed with not caring. ""Masque"" may not be among ""The Best of the Best"" but it is, in my book, ""The Best of the Rest.""",1115251200,4,3217,4.708703374777975
530244,4,6302993652,"The opening story of Season 14 showed a return to a historical adventure.  After a close encounter with the Mandragora Helix, the Doctor and Sarah head off to the Dukedom of San Martino in the late 15th century.  Unfortunately, three things happen.  One, Sarah is captured by the black-robed brethren, members of the Cult of Demnos, who intend to have her sacrificed.  Two, the Doctor is captured by soldiers belonging to Count Federico.  Three, some Mandragora energy which had slipped into the TARDIS goes around killing people, grossly distorting their faces.
Count Federico is quite the authoritarian, as his men make random attacks on peasants to get any idea of insurrection out of their heads.  He is beset by one obstacle in his attempts to gain the dukedom after the death of his brother.  That is his young nephew Giuliano, someone interested in scholarly learning, particularly astronomy, but also justice.  ""I want to rule over a land where there is no tyranny, no lies, no blind ignorance and superstition. ... We make our own lives... not the stars.""
That last is against Hieronymous, the hooded court astrologer with a funny forked beard who also heads the cult.  The Mandragora energy communicates with him and choses him as the one to become supreme ruler of the Earth.  Hieronymous deems himself a humble astrologer and interpreter who says ""the decrees of fate must be obeyed.  We have no choice.""  I wonder if the name of this character was inspired by Hieronymous de Savanarola, who condemned church corruption under the Borgias and wore a monk's habit in public.
The Doctor and Sarah are befriended by Giuliano, who perceived the Doctor's scholarly abilities.  He finds an ally in the Doctor, who helps him against Federico, who begins to openly move against his own nephew.
Great lines:  when Hieronymous accuses the Doctor of profaning the sacred stone of the cult, the Doctor replies flippantly, ""Oh, come off it, Hieronymous.  You know who I am.  You can drop all that bosh about profanity and sacred stones.  Just be your natural horrid self.""
One interesting question viewers might have is why do the Doctor's companions understand and speak with the local inhabitants in their travels.  Here, the Doctor explains it as a Time Lord gift he shares with his companions.
Other things:  Tim Pigott-Smith plays Marco, Giuliano's companion and at times, stronger friend.  And Norman Jones (Hieronymous) appeared in another Who story The Silurians as the ill-fated Major Baker.  This also sees the introduction of the secondary TARDIS console, with brown wood paneling, brass fittings, and no central column, and smaller so it could be more easily moved.  And the Doctor should've said ""another 150 years"" instead of ""another 50 years"" when he says ""we could've used Galileo's [telescope].""
Some sources place the setting as 1478, but as Giuliano mentions a man who believes the Earth is round and not flat, it's more likely 1492, as Columbus's theories were accepted upon his return back the following year.
The concept of superstition, astrology, and predestination, represented by the Helix, and that of knowledge, astronomy, and free will, represented by Giuliano and the Doctor seems a bit simplistic, but it works.  After all, who would want to have their decision guided when Mars is in the House of the Ram or is in conjunction with Saturn?  For man, the only thing worth having is a sense of purpose-""the ability granted to every living being to shape its own destiny"" instead of being idle-minded, useless sheep.  Indeed, Giuliano's pondering, ""Perhaps the stars don't move, maybe it's we who move"" sums it all.  In that sense, it succeeds, with the use of Portmeiron in Northern Wales a good location doubling for early Renaissance Italy.",1077926400,3,3770,5.01123595505618
530245,2,6302993652,"Boring sums up this episode of Dr. Who.  I tend not to be overly critical of most of the story lines, but I honestly must tell you that your money would be better spent on other tales. The doctor and Sarah find themselves in medievel Italy where a cult exists that is attempting to control the world. During the Doctors travels, he accidently picks up an energy source (glows red all the time) and brings it unknowingly to medievel Italy. It isn't long before this evil energy type entity establishes itself within this ancient cult and possesses its members to perform its bidding. This episode lacks anything intriguing in its storyline and I often found myself either falling asleep by the boredom of it all or eyeing my stack of other Dr. Who adventures with the idea of ejecting for another. Don't make this episode a priority if you collect Dr. Who tapes.  And, if you must buy it, perhaps just buy one used. This episode could have been written so so much better. I got the distinct impression this was an episode that was thrown together by the writer in quite a big hurry!",1063929600,2,1081,4.538461538461538
530246,3,6302993652,"The Doctor and Sarah are ""blown off course"" into Renaissance Italy by an alien intelligence that wants to suppress humankind's scientific and intellectual development.  The alien intelligence finds a ready-made power base in the form of a secret religious cult and sets about trying to disrupt history.  Meanwhile the Doctor and Sarah are caught in the middle of a family struggle: a bloodthirsty Count is trying to manipulate events so as to wrest power away from his nephew, the Duke.
Period pieces are always one of Doctor Who's strong suits and this trip to 1492 Italy is no exception.  Great attention is paid to the costuming and set design, and there are even throwaway bits of dialogue that allude to historic figures like da Vinci and Galileo.  There is a touching (dare I say flirtatious?) moment when the Duke Guiliano (Gareth Armstrong) confesses to Sarah his belief that the world is actually a sphere.  For me the hard part is watching all these British actors with West End accents trying to pass themselves off as Renaissance Italians!  The least believable moment comes when Sarah is hypnotized by the court astrologer and persuaded to assassinate the Doctor.  I just can't swallow the idea that a cosmopolitan reporter from 1970's London can suddenly be made to believe her best friend is an ""evil sorcerer.""
A large chunk of this episode is shot on location in Portmeirion, a town which has apparently doubled for Italy in a number of other television shows and movies over the years.  Enjoyable for Shakespearean-style court intrigue, swordfighting stuntwork, and the way it tackles the razor's edge issue of science over mysticism, THE MASQUE OF MANDRAGORA is nevertheless probably Season Thirteen's weakest episode.  Heironymus (Norman Jones) is just plain not scary, even after he turns into a ball of lightning in a purple robe.  Count Federico (Jon Laurinmore) is a far better villian, contemptuously sneering his way through scene after scene right on up until his grisly end.  Tom Baker is in good form throughout, tossing out flippant one-liners and insults to palace guards and astrologers, but the overall pacing of the story is inconsistent and doesn't adequately explain just exactly how Good Triumphed Over Evil at the end.",1017878400,3,2256,5.053908355795148
530247,5,6302993652,"One day I was surfing channel (in those ancient days when you did it by turning a knob standing next to the set.) when I spotted a fellow with curley hair and a long scarf in a little room that turned out to be an infinately big time machine that ended up in Italy in the era of Leonardo Da Vinci.  I found it interesting but thought nothing of it till a few months later when I happened to catch the start of the very same episode again.  This time I found out when it was on and my 25 year long love affair with Dr. Who began.
This episode started it all.  We see the doctor in Italy battling a cult from the past and an intelligence from the future as they attempt to alter human history for their own ends.  A great combination of humor, action and adventure.  A pretty good description of the whole series.
Dr. Who fans you will enjoy the return to the backup control room which provides much more ambiance than the regular one.
I can't guarentee you'll fall in love with the series if you watch this one, but you'll find it fun.",1008460800,16,1034,4.15
530248,3,6302993652,"This is kind of an odd entry into the Tom Baker Dr Who episodes, set in Renaissance Italy and concerning a vaguely defined interstellar Space Threat that wants to enslave humanity through a pagan religion. At stakes are the Duchy of San Martino, Leanardo daVinci, and a whole lot of great looking period costumes. This is kind of a hard episode to really get enthusiastic about (even though it is very well made) if only because there are times when one isn't sure if the actors are playing straight with us or laughing up their sleeves when the camera isn't on them. Baker especially at times seems to step outside of the seriousness of what the story tries to set and embarks on fits of histrionics that seem like desperate attempts to make the story more interesting for Doctor Who fans that might be getting bored. My favorite character is the mysterious seer Hieronymous [just listening to the actors speak his name is fun], but it's never really clear just what the threat he propogates is (though Baker does his best to explain it to us through Sarah) or just how the Hieronymous became involved. Or the Doctor, for that matter. The effects-dependent final slaughter by the Bretheren is especially awkward, and sort of hints at a script that needed an ending rather than a successful conclusion to an involving story. Still, it's a fun episode to look at and listen to -- costumes and sets all appear appropriate, Count Frederico makes a worthy, sneering, period-insult spewing villain, I love the scenes set outside it what are certainly authentic Medeterranian ruins, and the episode seems to slyly hint at a relationship between Duke Juliano and his companion Marco that is ahead of it's time for 1976 era televison. Worth a look; recommended for fans.",1007164800,,1762,4.7993421052631575
530249,4,6302993652,"Doctor Who has always been very good with stories the fans call ""pseudo-historicals"", meaning tales that take place in a historical setting, but involve science fiction concepts - such as ""Pyramids of Mars"", ""The Talons of Weng-Chiang"", and ""The Curse of Fenric"", to name just a few. This is another such story, but it has always been cast aside by most fans for more popular adventures.
In truth, though, it's a pretty entertaining yarn...Tom Baker and Lis Sladen are both very good, and plot - the idea that the Doctor has unwittingly brought a fearsome sentient energy to 15th century Italy - is unusual for this era of the programme. The historical costumes and sets are very nicely done, and most of the guest cast are believable in their roles. The only real problem is that it drags a bit in the last episode, and the final solution isn't totally satisfying.
This is perhaps not the best Tom Baker story out there, but it's an enjoyable one and shouldn't be passed over.",995932800,13,977,4.686046511627907
530250,3,6302993652,"This Tom Baker adventure is an example of style over substance. The usual threat of alien invasion is dealt with in a more original way than usual, with a cosmic entity known as the Mandragora Helix planning to destroy  human learning and endeavour at the time of the Renaissance, thus plunging  the world into superstition and intellectual decay. Strangely enough,  however, for a story set in Renaissance Italy, there is too much  technobabble, especially in the climax, which is insufficiently explained.  The story just ends and we're left asking how. (With no answer!) However,  the story is a triumph of design. It has brilliant period costumes, lush  surroundings and exquisite dance scenes during the masque. There is also a  brooding sense of underlying terror. (The Doctor trapped in the temple  while it is recreating itself is one such example.) There is also wonderful  acting from all involved. The deficiencies of ""The Masque of  Mandragora"" are overwhelmed by its sheer style.",951350400,,992,5.1375

530286,5,6302993652,"""The Masque of Mandragora"" is the opening story to season 14 of Doctor Who, and unlike most fans, I love it. Perhaps it was overshadowed by ""The Seeds of Doom"" or ""The Hand of Fear"". Perhaps people didn't like the concept. Whatever it was, this story isn't very well liked among fans. And I cannot for the life of me see why. Louis Marks has proven himself to be a very good writer, with stories like ""Day of the Daleks"" and ""Planet of Evil"", and here, he does not disappoint. The setting is brilliantly done, and really captures Renaissance Italy. The characters are pretty good for the most part, but the performances are outstanding. I especially like Norman Jones as Hieronymus. I also love the plot of the story. In this four part adventure, the Doctor and Sarah Jane encounter the deadly Mandragora Helix, which then follows them to Earth in the TARDIS. Mandragora wants to take over the Earth, so that mankind will never reach the stars. This was a story which tried to use a different kind of villain, and it is very successful. Mandragora is a great villain, and is even able to nearly kill the Doctor. Overall, the Masque of Mandragora is a great story that every Doctor Who fan should see.",1388361600,4,1200,4.560185185185185

530346,4,6302993652,"The Doctor and Sarah are pulled into a spiral in space called the Mandragora Helix, which looks suspiciously like blue paint with silver flecks in it going down a bathtub drain but is actually the source of a malevolent influence seeking to take over Earth. Mandragora energy in the form of a sparkling red orb infiltrates the TARDIS and is unwittingly transported by the Doctor to Renaissance Italy, where it escapes and gets up to all sorts of mischief.

The science-fiction element of this story is paper thin, but the lush Renaissance setting and costumes are captivating enough to make you understand why the show was at the top of its game during this period. Exterior scenes were shot on location in the village of Portmeirion in Wales, which had been used as the setting for the TV series The Prisoner, although it was sufficiently altered for Doctor Who that fans of the earlier series might not recognize it. The dialogue, written by Louis Marks, is very sharp, particularly delivered by this cast, which includes several experienced Shakespearean actors, such as Gareth Armstrong and Tim Piggott-Smith, who look right at home in swords and tights.

""The Masque of Mandragora"" is also notable for the introduction of the second TARDIS control room, a particular favorite of mine. The brass-appointed, dark wood-paneled set was designed to give the control room a fresh look in a more easily manageable size. Designer Barry Newbery says in one of the Special Features that he was channeling Jules Verne. By reaching into science fiction's past, however, his design was actually ahead of its time, predating the Steampunk movement of the 1980s by at least seven years.",1303257600,3,1676,4.982142857142857

530352,4,6302993652,"""How Big is Big?....""The Masque of the Mandragora, Season opener for the Fourth Doctor was surprisingly low key. We begin with the Doctor and Sarah in a TARDIS corridor having a conversation about his ""enormous boot cupboard.""

But as tame as the moment seems, it is one of the scenes I remember best from this story arc....up until this point very little of the TARDIS interior had been seen and here it is suggested how really huge it could be inside it's disguised form. Soon after this moment would be ""called back to"" in the chase through the TARDIS interior for ""INVASION of TIME.""

Another great thing about Masque is that is was another Dr. Who story  set in Earth's past following the Third Doctor's isolation to Earth's ""present"" with UNIT (and some galactic yo-yoing towards the end of his tenure) it is good to have the Doc travel for these historical adventures again. This time the Doctor and Sarah are on Earth during the Italian Renaissance when the corrupt and powerful Medicis rule, and to heap some more trouble on to that the Doctor inadvertently transports a Mandragora ball of energy and alien intelligence intent on conquering Earth.

There's a great cast of plotting and political characters maneuvering their Machiavellian notions through this tale: Evil Uncle Frederico; a Count planning to usurp the rule of his nave, nephew; Giuliano, with the aid of his court astrologer Hieronymous, not to mention the evil brothers of the Cult of Demnos. As in much of the Classic episodes of Dr. Who, there are clear similarities to Classic Lit., this time it is POE's ""Masque of the Red Death"", with added twists ofcourse. This isn't a complaint, mind you.

There's lots of horses, swords, wonderful costumes and wonderful dialogue, too. There's a running gag begun in this one in which the Doctor never gets to meet the great Leonardo DaVinci, I hope the new series picks up on this and does a story. Not to mention the open ending of this one...look out 1980's!!!

Other than that though, this was a great story.

The TARDIS is forced off course, landing the Doctor and Sarah in an alien world where the Mandragora energy lives. Mandragora stows-away on the TARDIS where it arrives in 15th century Italy.
