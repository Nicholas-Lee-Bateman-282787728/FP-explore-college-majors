7884918,5,6305161461,"When I first read about this movie, I was expecting a fire in a prison and Chow and his buddy trying to get out. What I got instead was a beautiful drama about friendship in the midst of prison. It was almost a combination of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Last Castle."" The acting was wonderful. And for a prison drama, it was very tender. The characters were great and you could feel yourself bonding with them. If you don't mind a good foreign film you have to read, Prison on Fire is a good movie for you.",1020729600,2,514,4.255102040816326
7884919,4,6305161461,"Audiences used to Western style cinema might poo-poo at the melodramatic sentiments of this film.  It is melodramatic and at times unrealistic (I mean how many times can a guy get beaten but not die? ) but it is also  without a doubt different.  This is not an American prison film by any  means which is reason enough to watch it.  Also despite the gritty violence  that Ringo Lam is known for, this is not a Midnight Express type film.  Sure, there is the bad guard but there are also good guards.
Chow plays a  kind hearted prisoner who knows the system.  He takes the naive Tony Leung  Ka Fai and helps him get through his prison term.  Despite the closeness of  the men's friendship in prison, there is no subtext (just as there isn't  meant to be one in John Woo's HK films)
Chow is at his best here and  shows why he is such a respected actor in the East.  His expressions and  mannerisms are excellent and help make Prison on Fire such a good film.  Some of the expressions Chow used in this film and his other HK classics  are used sporadically and unevenly in The Corruptor (Chow's 2nd American  film.)
Prison on Fire and City on Fire (School on Fire is the last in the  trilogy) are known as Ringo Lam's masterpieces and it's easy to tell why.  Prison is a fast paced film with loads of heart.  The fighting among  prisoners and among guards is quite something to watch.  It's a prison film  with chinese ideals of chivlary, honor and friendship among men.  One could  even make a case for it being a film with John Wooism themes with out the  ballet.",944697600,9,1562,4.348432055749129
