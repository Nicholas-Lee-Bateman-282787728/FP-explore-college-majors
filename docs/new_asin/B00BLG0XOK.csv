8570385,3,B00BLG0XOK,"Terminator Zan Kill is an okay Japanese flick. But it's really for Asami fans only. She's very cute and she can act. The plot has to do with time travel, it's a knock off of the Terminator movie. A cyborg from the furture fights a ninja girl from the past. But the flick has a really low budget so don't expect too much cool action.",1375920000,,332,4.123076923076923
