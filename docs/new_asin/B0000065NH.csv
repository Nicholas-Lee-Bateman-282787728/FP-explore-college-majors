1191086,5,B0000065NH,"this tape was so much fun. i'm a very lazy person and hate exercise but when i bought this tape and put it on to see what it's about i just couldn't help shaking my tush!!! it's packed with stretching, low-impact aerobis, and weight training all done in a ""dancy"" fun manner! another thing i loved is that the people doing the workout in the video are all normal looking poeple of all shapes and sizes! if you love dancing to the oldies, then you'll love this tape.",1034121600,19,465,4.295454545454546
1191087,5,B0000065NH,"I never, ever exercised until I found this tape about ten years ago--and I haven't stopped using it since then. No matter how many other tapes I try, I still rely on this one. It's fun and it's got everything: stretches, low-impact aerobics, floor exercises, and even some weight training. I have rheumatoid arthritis and never imagined that I could DO this or any other exercise routine for regular people, but these exercises and dance routines are wonderfully gentle on the joints! As for Richard...What can I say? He's an acquired but addictive taste--a real kick. You've gotta love anyone who makes you feel this good!",1027900800,16,623,4.886792452830188
1191088,4,B0000065NH,"I am not into exercise one bit. I hate it. But a health scare and being tired of shopping at the plus size store (and their lack of nice, reasonably priced clothes) made me get off my [rear] last month and start to exercise every day. I bought this tape and started to do it every other day, cut out soda, and ate better. I also do weights on my off days for about half an hour. In a month, I cannot say how much I lost. But I can tell  my clothes fit better. The music in this tape is inspiring. Richard tells you to keep going just when you want to stop. The best part of the tape (aside from the routines) is the motivational ending (when you see how much weight everyone has lost). It is a good first step into exercising.",1021939200,7,726,4.006896551724138
1191089,5,B0000065NH,"I have this video (along with all his others) and I love it!  It's a motivative, fun and energetic workout with great music and of course Richard's great sense of humor to get you up and going and to keep you coming back for more!  Love it!",990662400,9,240,4.085106382978723
1191090,5,B0000065NH,"I began with slow walks around the block everyday. At first only 10 minutes, but working up to 30-60 minute walks. Then one day I put in an Oldies tape and started dancing. These tapes appeal to me since I always have enjoyed dancing and wished I was better at it. Well, when I dance alone I can PRETEND I'm the best dancer eve. ;) Good music and cheerful banter helped motivate me. As I lost weight and need to kick up the routine I added weights, speeded it up, picked up videos to alternate with......It's been 2 years now and I still enjoy a week or two of Richard's videos when the weather is rainy or when I just feel like giving my mood a push up.
I really enjoy seeing real live people working out in these videos. Female, male......Obese to average, muscular to flabby......It makes me feel good to be working out with other normal appearing persons.
THe advantage you get with aerobics is that when you ""outgrow"" a video you either step up your speed or add weights to  your wrists and ankles for toning. This video is the best for toning if you add 1 pound strap-weights for the entire video and instead of ligting bottles grab 3-6 pound weights.
I'm less than 30 pounds from ideal weight now and I still use this video for a toning workout.",988243200,20,1252,4.35042735042735
1191091,4,B0000065NH,"I use this and Sweatin' to the Oldies III. I love the music and dancing, however it is hard to follow this video because the camera isn't always on Richard at the beginning of a dance or when he changes steps. Head shots don't help with foot work. STTO III is more professional in this regard.  At first I thought that this didn't provide as good a workout as STTO III, but my heart rate and sweat prove otherwise.  I believe it is because these dances use your arms more.  Richard is great for those of us who don't have perfect bodies and probably never will.  Even though I am toned and losing weight, I will never look like Denise Austin or Kathy Ireland. I've just ordered the original STTO and will let you know what I think.",987465600,13,731,4.27536231884058
1191092,5,B0000065NH,"I love this tape.  I really love using Richard Simmons because he doesn't make it feel like you're really excersizing, but having fun.  He always  shows you how to have a good time.  I use this everyday!",966816000,8,203,4.405405405405405
1191093,4,B0000065NH,"Richard's tapes are fun to do. There is a pretty steep learning curve, but  they are a blast once you get the routines down. This one includes (brief)  upper and lower body toning. The routine is fun and flows well. Don't  expect consistent mirror cueing though. That's not Richard's strong point.  But if you're looking for support, enthusiasm, and real people (instead of  hard bodies), I highly recommend Richard's aerobics tapes and especially  this one (and Dance Your Pants Off for more advanced exercisers). I'd rate  this as good for Beginners to Intermediate.",965001600,26,568,5.043010752688172
1191094,5,B0000065NH,"My friend,Marcia from Texas,loves this tape. She use to weigh 450,now she's down to 398. This video has really helped. We all worry about Marcia,and finally she's getting her life back on track thanks to Richard  Simmons. Before getting into this tape,all Marcia did was watch TV,and eat. I  even got Marcia to buy Richards new window diet. At first she was running  out of Windows,but now she's doing great. Keep up the good work,my  wonderfull friend,were all praying for you.",964310400,10,478,4.864197530864198

1191146,1,B0000065NH,guess I didn't read the fine print well.  didn't realize this was for a VCR.  i cannot use and cannot return.,1407110400,,109,4.142857142857143
1191147,5,B0000065NH,Richard Simmons was so high energy back then (and I think for his age he is still going good) how could anyone resist jumping in and following along with the exercises.  I'm in my seventies and still love him.,1405468800,,209,4.358974358974359
1191148,1,B0000065NH,The vhs tape played fine. When my wife took it out it was stuck and the tape broke. I was hoping to get another tape to try.,1402617600,,124,3.6296296296296298
1191149,3,B0000065NH,I bought this and other workout videos for my mother per her request and as far as I know they are collecting dust!,1365897600,,115,4.043478260869565
1191150,3,B0000065NH,"good:
the exercises are more complicated and much more varied.
almost the same cast.
pretty good songs

bad:
artsier and more ambitious. (the band arrives via sparkles? what universe is this?) i preferred the simpler setup of sweatin to the oldies one.
richard talks more. a lot more.

i would suggest watching the tape once before you exercise to get an idea of the movements so you're not stumbling, mouth agape as you reorient yourself every eight/four/single beats.",1334707200,,469,5.0
1191151,4,B0000065NH,I ordered this video to inspire me to exercise more.  I knew you can't go wrong with Richard Simmons as a workout instructor.  I am enjoying the video.,1299024000,,151,4.357142857142857
1191152,2,B0000065NH,"I have 5 RS tapes and this is one I'll probably not use very much...it has a shorter aerobic section and includes floor exercises.  Maybe when I get in better shape and want to add in floor exercises, I'll use this again.  Right now I need to get my lab result numbers down so I don't have to start taking more meds.",1298937600,,316,4.080645161290323
1191173,5,B0000065NH,"This is one of Richard's best all-around exercise videos with not only heart-rate pumping moves, but targeting for upper-body toning and abs workout.",1238976000,,149,5.521739130434782
1191174,5,B0000065NH,"I like this one the best, because the music is pretty innocent, and happy, rtaher than heavy rock music.  Gives you a very thorough aerobic workout that feels more like dancing fun than exercise!",1236038400,,195,4.735294117647059
1191175,2,B0000065NH,It would have been better if the moves were shown at a slower pace & then speed up so you have a chance to learn the steps.,1234742400,,123,3.5925925925925926
1191176,2,B0000065NH,"I do acknowledge that a lot of people enjoy this series of tapes/dvds and have lost weight using them, but I did not enjoy this workout.  I have some of his other tapes (not in the Sweatin to the Oldies series) that I like much better!",1201392000,,235,4.108695652173913
1191177,5,B0000065NH,"This just happens to be one of my favorite workout tapes.  While moving, I ordered this one since mine was stored.  The seller was great.  Shipped fast, communicated well, and sent a quality product.",1196467200,,199,4.794117647058823
1191178,5,B0000065NH,"I hate exercising. Can't begin to tell you the pieces of exercise equipment and what not I have bought to motivate me into getting into shape. I found this tape at my local library and thought, why not give it a try. I loved it so much that I went and bought my own copy. It encouraged me to see people who were not trim and fit doing these exercises. If they could do it so could I. I love the old 50's music. Now when I'm in a store and hear any of these songs playing it's all I can do to keep my body from exercising with it. :)  I also have bought Tone and Sweat (which is great) and Sweatin' To The Oldies 3. I don't seem to get as good of a work out with that one. With STTO 2 you get a total body work out and toning. Love the abs work out that you get. And I bought 3lb weights to do the arm toning. Thanks Richard!!!!!!!!!",1173052800,5,832,3.8092485549132946
1191179,5,B0000065NH,"I LOVE, LOVE this video! You feel so good afterwards! I get a total body workout, even like lifting weights!!! I'm 26, and overweight, but this video is something I can get up early and workout to, because I can keep up and cover every body part! The music is great and the moves really are fun! I also like the fact that the people are not twigs, they are real people that have, and need to lose weight! I've tried others, and I've held on to this one for more than 8 years! My other favorite thing is the end where you can see how much weight all the people in the video have already lost, kinda motivating to me! 5 STARS, I LOVE IT!!!",1162512000,4,637,4.063492063492063
1191180,5,B0000065NH,This one is the best.  The songs are great and the workout is fantastic.  This is my all time favorite workout video.,1161820800,5,117,4.2727272727272725
1191181,5,B0000065NH,"This is my all time favorite workout video!  This video is great for the young and the old because it combines fun dance moves with great oldies classics that everyone can enjoy.  It's the perfect workout for those with bad joints or do not have a wide range of motion.  The perfect start and end to a more thinner, happier you!!",1152144000,6,329,4.360655737704918
1191182,5,B0000065NH,"This right here is the best workout video. I first got into it late in my elementary school years. Ten years later, I still do it a couple times a week. Instead of using bottles as weights as they do in the video, I usually use soup cans. I have problems in my joints, and I cannot do any excersizes that put too much stress on my joints. I love this video because you can do it in your living room in your pajamas. I love it because it is easy to catch on to and I think it is a lot of fun. It is real motivational on those days you just don't want to excersize, but you see how much fun the people are having in the video, singing along, dancing, cheering, counting out the steps....I do it on those days when you just don't want to get out of bed. I do it as a warmup before i go running. I do it when I have too much energy or when I really have nothing better to do. I do it the week of finals when I need a study break but need to keep moving so I don't fall asleep. Basically, I do it all the time. I always bring it to 'workout video night'. My friends and I get together and everyone brings workout videos. I always make everyone start with this video because not only is it my favorite, I think it is a classic because it uses oldies that every knows and are fun to dance to. This is the perfect video to start a new workout schedule or to add some fun to a current one. I highly recommend this tape to everyone, all ages and sizes.",1073520000,24,1442,3.8915254237288135
7903714,2,B0000065NH,"First off I should've checked, it's a VHS! Good thing I still have a vcr.  The quality of the tape is horrible, and I'm sure it said new, not used.  That being said, for this old gal it's a great beginning to get back into exercising.",1490400000,,234,4.065217391304348
7903715,5,B0000065NH,"This is an absolute GEM. Toward the end they break out soda bottles to use as dumbbells and I didn't have soda bottles so duh, used wine bottles (also a little extra resistance get swoll) and you know any exercise that ends in a glass of wine is my kind of exercise. 10/10 will do again.",1486512000,,287,4.142857142857143

I was excited to see this on VHS, since it's way cheaper and I still have a VHS player :) And, of course, I love Richard and his videos. My husband and I have lots of other workouts, all of them newer and probably better, but it doesn't matter. I struggle to want to DO those, but I will happily sweat to the oldies with Richard! What good is a workout you don't do?! I love all of the people on this video - REAL people who sweat and struggle and get through it with me. There's no need for a ""modifier"" because they're ALL modifiers, lol, doing the best they can, just like my own sweet self :)",1469750400,,708,4.2518518518518515
