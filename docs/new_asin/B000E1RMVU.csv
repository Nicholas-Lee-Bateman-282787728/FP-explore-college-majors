If you like dancing and you want some new dance exercise moves, forget it.  This is BORING.  It's probably a decent low-impact workout, but don't we buy these dance exercise videos so exercise WON'T be boring?  Going for a power walk would be more interesting.  Paula Abdul's videos are much more fun.  Also I did not see hide nor hair of Denise Richards, touted as one of the ""actors"" on Amazon.  I take that back, I did not see her on the video, but she is pictured on the back cover.",1143331200,,637,4.469565217391304
