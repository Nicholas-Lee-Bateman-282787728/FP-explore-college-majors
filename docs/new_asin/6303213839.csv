7842107,5,6303213839,"Solid gold - You can see the beginnings of the Honeymooners in these 6 episodes of The Life Of Riley. Gleason played Chester A Riley, television's first blue collar hero. William Bendix would later play Riley, but Gleason was first. All from 1949 with 132 minutes of pure enjoyment.",1121040000,2,282,4.775510204081633
7842108,5,6303213839,"This is an absolute MUST HAVE tape if you are a fan of ""The Honeymooners"" because this is where it all started. This show was aired in 1949, wich makes the tape a MUST HAVE if you are a TV fan. A MUST HAVE if you are a Jackie Gleason fan. A MUST have if you are a nostalgia fan. Is it funny? Yes. Is it as funny as the Honeymooners? No.
These shows were filmed with no audience. Some of the episodes have obvious laugh tracks while others have no audience reaction at all. Television itself was a brand new thing. TV was a newborn baby. However you can realy notice how the Honeymooners simply built upon this show, wich only ran for 1 season. The ""wacky neighbor"" was named Gillis in this show. He is the birth of good ol Ed Norton! Is he as funny? An emphatic no! But the show has some laughs and it is enjoyable.
Buy it simply because it's one of the first sit-coms, if not the first. Buy it because it features a very young Jackie Gleason in his first television show. A true classic. DVD release anyone?",1075939200,3,1008,4.1479591836734695
