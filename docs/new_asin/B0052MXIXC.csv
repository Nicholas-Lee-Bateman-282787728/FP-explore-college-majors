4530142,5,B0052MXIXC,"There are very few videos that I feel GOOD about putting in the dvd player for my kids to watch.  This however, is one of them!  Both my 8 year old and my 2 year old love the stories; the animation is excellent; the storylines are interesting; and everything is WHOLESOME.  Well done!",1319932800,10,284,4.320754716981132
4530143,5,B0052MXIXC,"The Busy World of Richard Scarry collection is now complete with this box set. There are 35 episodes on this set of disc which will provide hours of entertainment for your children. Good, clean fun can be had with Huckle Cat, Lowly Worm, and their many friends in Busy Town. The picture quality isn't HD, but still looks good enough for everyone to enjoy. A great show from the '90s for your children to enjoy today. Highly recommended for your family.",1318896000,4,452,4.592592592592593
4530144,5,B0052MXIXC,"Well, I finally got all 65 episodes on DVD. I'm so happy that they had released this last week. I ordered it off from Amazon the first day it was release and it came in mail today. I finally get to see my favorite episodes. Like I said before, I been praying for this set to be released. And it has been answered. This is for the fans here, if you want all 65 episodes all at once on DVD, I highly recommend you get the two titles called ""Every Day There's Something New!"" and ""Fun in Busytown"". I ain't getting ""It's a Busy, Busy Day!"" or ""Good Times Never End!"", cause the same episodes on those DVDs is feature on the first two Discs on Volume 1. They probably going to release 10 episodes every year in a single Disc DVD. I won't be getting those neither. The Busy World of Richard Scarry is extremely entertaining. Now that I have both of these two DVD sets, I can watch a couple of episodes anytime I want to day or night. I really don't care about watching it on Television no more. I think it's currently doing its reruns on ThisTV channel which I read from Wikipedia. But I don't have that channel. But none of that matters. And once again Cookie Jar and Mill Creek Entertainment, thank you so much for the DVD releases. I finally have them all.",1311638400,32,1254,4.229166666666667

4530150,5,B0052MXIXC,"100% agree with ""wholesome"" comment of another reviewer.  We have both sets and it remains a favorite of our three year old son after a year and a half.

Great value too!  Each episode consist of three main segments with stand alone stories.  Segments focus on plot.  Usually there is a morality lesson, but it is not overbearing.  Short interstitials focused on safety lessons or basic knowledge rather than plot.

Small town kids enjoy fun adventures and generally model excellent behavior.  Adult characters are supportive but fallible, empowering children.  Some segments introduce foreign locales (outside Canada and US) and historical tidbits.  Short interstitials between segments teach safety lessons or other basic information on how society works.

Highly recommend this!  We are not comfortable with many other cartoons, which often include unexpected violence and bad examples.",1368230400,2,889,5.503703703703704

4530154,5,B0052MXIXC,"I simply love The Busy World of Richard Scarry. Words cannot describe how wonderful it is! I remember watching it in the 1990s when it originally aired. I also remember re-runs on television from 2008 to 2009. Now with this complete set (and the other set, Everyday There's Something New) I can watch it over and over again. The show is wonderful! There is no discrimination, no violence, no hatred, simply love, joy, and peace. There are many valuable lessons that the show communicates, such as how to cross the street and what to do in an emergency. I also grew up with the original Richard Scarry books, and they too are delightful! It saddens me that shows like this are not made anymore. It seems that back in the 1990s animation was better and shows like this were treasures. You certainly do not get that now, and today's youth do not appreciate shows like this. I love Busytown and its characters because they make me happy; they reassure me that life is indeed good and remind me to keep going in the midst of difficulty. Bottom line: The Busy World of Richard Scarry: Fun in Busytown! is the best EVER! You won't be disappointed!",1343088000,4,1140,4.565853658536585

8454012,1,B0052MXIXC,The Paramount logo does NOT belong in the opening sequence. They should remove the Paramount logo in the opening sequence. Because in TV shows the production company's logo go in the closing credits not in the opening sequence.
