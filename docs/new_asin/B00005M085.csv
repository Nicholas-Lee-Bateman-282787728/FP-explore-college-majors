7945043,5,B00005M085,"are three words that I would use describe this video.  With this video and the gentle guided movements I was able to heal a severely pulled muscles in my back and leg.  As with all exercises, discuss with a practictioner.  I found Marlon's presentation to be easy to understand. She guides the user through a posture check at the beginning of the tape, and reminds you to breathe throughout this video.  I wasn't sure if it would help, but I now am thankful to Marlon and yoga for this healing.  This video also provides a great stretch of the lower back and sacrum, even if you don't have injuries.  I like to use it before retiring for the evening since I feel so relaxed when I am finished.",1011916800,7,693,4.375
