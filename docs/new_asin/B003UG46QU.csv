8405957,1,B003UG46QU,"Was very disappointed in this DVD. The original DVD for gymboree was amazing. I thought this was it or more of the
same, and it was awful. Hardly any singing, and what singing there was did not entertain my kids at all, compared to the
orignal DVD. Do not buy. You will be sadly disappointed. Waste of $20.00.",1483574400,,309,4.344827586206897
