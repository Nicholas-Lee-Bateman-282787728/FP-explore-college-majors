  This has to be one of the worst productions on the Civil War that I have ever seen, & I've seen just about all of them!
  History Channel plays pretty loose with the truth, but I'll only quote one here... ""Each worker could cast 3,000 bullets per hour!""
  For this to be possible, it would require a ""gang"" mould pouring molten lead into 50 receptacles & repeating this every 45 seconds!",1496361600,,413,4.44

8432364,3,B004K4FUG6,"Generally, I like the Story of US series, and the Civil War episode delivers on a number of fronts. Keeping with one of the overall themes of innovation in the series, this episode takes viewers through how Lincoln and the North were able to use technology such as new weaponry, rail, the telegraph and innovations in medicine to help the North win the War effort. The visuals are amazing, and I highly recommend it as a supplemental to the more traditional curriculum that would likely cover Lincoln's politics and the major Civil War battles. This is, however, where the episode comes up short. Especially when explaining the Southern perspective on slavery and any advantages or disadvantages the South had in the war. Furthermore, the extent to which Lincoln goes to preserve the union, often breaking the Constitution, is passed over as Lincoln simply asserting Federal control, as if such a concept was a given. The Civil War was at its heart a struggle between state and federal power. Finally, and very egregiously, the episode ends with the narrator stating that after the war, the country ""came back together"", entirely ignoring perhaps the darkest and most controversial time in US history: Reconstruction. Jim crow laws and such are touched upon in the civil rights episode, but how can a series not cover the rise of the KKK and the military occupation of the South?!",1350259200,,1380,4.927038626609442

They will only see the segment on the Civil War and I've seen the entire series. Honestly, all schools should introduce this to the students. Makes history that much more exciting and interesting.

After watching it the first time, my students were overheard arguing that they wanted to be the Union soldiers, not the South. But they are still learning about it and I am hoping that by the time they get to junior high, they will be well-versed in a segment of historical significance.

Highly recommend it!
