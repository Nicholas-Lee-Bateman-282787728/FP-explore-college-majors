8455117,2,B0053CBAOK,The DVD is just a copy taken off of television. About 2/3 through the movie there is about 90 seconds of silence. Aggravating.,1404777600,,126,4.521739130434782
8455118,3,B0053CBAOK,I love this movie but the copy I received is very poor quality.  It was obviously something someone copied from a local television broadcast.  There were interruptions in the flow of the movie... I assume for commercials during the broadcast.  At one point the sound completely disappeared for a a whole scene.  I was very disappointed in the copy I received.  I would still love to see a copy of the movie that is professionally done.,1365897600,2,435,4.671052631578948
