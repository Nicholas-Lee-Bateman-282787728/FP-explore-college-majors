4022743,3,B002ZG9788,"Does anyone else feel that the ""Release the Kraken"" line has been used way too much in all the TV adds and trailers? Other than those three words, I was quite looking forward to Clash of the Titans. I have never seen the 1981 version, even though I tried renting the Blu-ray prior to seeing this remake, but it's not in stock anywhere. Those looking for high art are at the wrong movie, but if you want some B movie popcorn fun, this might do the trick. Parts of it reminded me of the mess that was 10,000 B.C., but it never quite gets that bad.

The acting is slightly better than I had read about from critics. Sam Worthington is okay, though a bit too bland. He was much better in Terminator: Salvation and Avatar. I'm still not sure if this guy has star quality or not. Liam Neeson (Zeus) and Ralph Fiennes (Hades) both turn in performances worthy of a movie with better writing, but they manage to do the most with the average script. Same goes for Mads Mikkelsen (Draco). As far as the ladies go, Gemma Arterton (lo) and Alexa Devalos (Andromeda) are nice to look at for sure, but Arterton's character is more interesting, mainly because she is actually given things to do.

Movies like this live and die by the CGI. About half of it works, but some is very mediocre. Nothing reaches the depths of The Scorpion King look in The Mummy Returns, but at least that has the excuse of coming out in 2001. Which leads me to the 3-D. If given the choice of 2-D or 3-D, I don't mind paying double the price for this popular format, but I'm glad I listened to the critics and other movie goers who have said that the rushed 3-D job here stinks. At least Alice in Wonderland had a lot of time put into it's upconvert. I heard they spent only two months or so on Clash of the Titans, leaving the film looking too dark and turning the action scenes into nothing more than headache starters. Take it from me, I saw it in 2-D, saved five bucks, and thought it looked good.

I love Greek mythology, with all the cool creatures that go along with it, and I'm currently hacking and slashing my way through God of War III, so Clash of the Titans was fully entertaining in my eyes, but this movie needed more effort in the script and CGI department. Still, it's fun and worth seeing on the BIG screen. In fact, I'm not sure if they should have made this movie any less silly. Perhaps that's exactly what it's suppose to be.

Perseus may be the son of Zeus here, but Kratos will always be my God slayer.",1270252800,,2488,4.287234042553192
4022744,4,B002ZG9788,"The 1981 Clash of the Titans was/still is a campy yet visually stunning fantasy classic. Campy? You ask? How could it not be, the Myths and archetypes by very definition are larger than life, so it stands to reason that the remake is going to have some camp to it, as well. And it does, but it doesn't disappoint as a popcorn picture, there the remake, like the original delivers. The original has the lovely Harry Hamlin, seriously,  Perseus is prettier than Princess of Argos  Andromeda. In the remake, up-and-comer Sam Worthington (Terminator 4, Avator) plays Perseus and has even less to do with the Princess than in the original, but he sure ain't no pretty-boy, and the new Andromeda is pretty, but Perseus is matched with the cursed and hauntingly attractive IO, this time round. Worthington's Perseus is even more of a reluctant hero than Hamlin, playing the everyman, a fisherman who has his great destiny thrust upon him. We get  more of a glimse of his back story this time, including the flashback to Zeus' seduction of Perseus' mother and another origin for Calibos tied to the bastard demi-god's birth (instead of the cursed son of goddess Thetis. Not from any real Greek myth, It has been said that Calibos was based on Caliban from ""The Tempest"" by William Shakespeare.)

 The story is pretty similar to both the original and the myth; Perseus' re-gifted winged sandals still don't make it to the film's finale. The Mortals feeling as if they have been abandoned declare war on the gods,  Hades  leads the retaliation upon mankind in an attempt to seize power and usurp his brother Zeus. Perseus' adopted family is killed as Perseus swears vengeance Lord of the Underworld. Prideful Queen Cassiopeia again compares her daughter's beauty to that of the gods, to make amends Andromeda must be sacrificed or the whole city will be lost. Son of Zeus Perseus ends up on a quest to save Argos (and the lovely Andromeda ) from the punishment of the Kraken, collecting gifts and companions along the way, like some sword & sandals Magnificent Seven. Unlike the original, this film better captures the sense of scale between the gods and their strife with their less loyal subjects. It feels less like the Argons are the sole mortal effected. The bar for the gods is naturally raised, impressive transmutations and grand entrances and appearances, an homage to the clay figures of the original, only vaster.

Although there are no Knights or Dames, the casting for the 2010 film is as impressively close to overkill as the original with egos such as Liam Neeson as Zeus (Olivier in '81), Ralph Fiennes a.k.a. Lord Voldemort is a perfect fit for Hades (omitted from the original). As I said Worthington replaces Harry Hamlin as Perseus, the lovely French actress Alexa Davalo as Andromeda (for Judi Bowker), Gemma Arterto( soon to be seen in Prince of Persia) plays  Io, who befriends Perseus in a much sexier way that Bergus Meridth's character. Luke Evans has a couple lines as the ""prettier than Harry Hamlin""other son of Zeus, APOLLO ( ironicly enough Evans will BE playing Zeus in 2011's Dawn of War). A number of models are cast, well, to look pretty;  for example Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova gets her turn as a much lovelier more sympatric Medusa than you would expect, and English beauty Agyness Deyn stands as little more than Olympus window-dressing as Aphrodite. Speaking of pretty, the movie was filmed mostly on location in the Canary Islands, and cinematography makes full use of the lush Greekish scenery .

The Great Ray Harryhausen (Jason & the Argonauts), stop-motion genius behind all of the mythological critters of the '81 original initially questioned the need for a remake...but approved of the effects of this one. The homage to his brilliant serpent-bodied Medusa is apparent, as is the return of the the giant scorpions, the Pegasus, Calibos and not to mention the over-the-top sea-monstery goodness of the Kraken for the climax. Speaking of homages, Bebo cameo at the half-hour mark. One new addition the Djinn, desert  mages who extend their immortally by replace their flesh with  ""charwood and black magic,"" appearing  as nightmarish treelike Middle-Earth figures  with glowing blue eyes and wicked teeth. The visuals are pleasing, but the movie was retrofitted with the 3-D effect, so it has it's moments, but isn't super, but the directing style of Louis Leterrier (Hulk) lends itself to the techniques used for the process.

Best not to think of this as a re-make, but a Spring Break distraction, for which it serves it's purpose...
I expect the Kraken will soon topple the Dragons & their trainers from the box office weeklys.",1270252800,6,4675,4.906210392902408
4022745,1,B002ZG9788,"I loved the Clash of the Titans as a child and I still enjoy it. I decided to ignore the film critics and see this thing. See people told me not to pay attention to critics. Never mind a 20% or so rotten rating at rotten tomatoes, for example. They got my 10 bucks. And couple hours I'll never get back. I have noting good to say about this thing. Elements of what goes into a decent film are not present. Of all the mediocre and terrible remakes this ranks at the bottom.
Edit (04/07): A little more.
The first pre-cgi, pre-video game paradigm movie had a stillness to it and reality that only real sets can achieve. And a stillness brought to the screen during a time when people could sit in a theater and pay attention without busting out with brightly shinning phones to text message.

Seems like people younger than late 20s don't even notice.

Did you notice the tranquility on Mt. Olympus? Sure the set sucked, but for its time it was good and *what matters now is it doesn't feel like a video game*.

Laurence Olivier's performance has lasted. Liam Neeson's will not. Why?

And who made a better hero Harry Hamlin or the Avatar manikin?

And what about the old playwright played by Burgess Meredith of Rocky and tv series Batman fame (as The Penguin)? He largely made the movie for me. Compare the playwright to the immortal whatever-she-was that I guess was meant to take his place as a sort of story guide or something (Never mind she dies too, which is another idiotic plot hole).",1270166400,4,1492,4.450549450549451
4022746,4,B002ZG9788,"While I've never agreed with the idea that only bad movies should be remade, the 1981 version of ""Clash of the Titans"" is a perfect example of why such statements are valid. This new 2010 version is, quite simply, a better film. It features special effects that are convincing, and with all due respect to his fans, the same cannot be said about the Ray Harryhausen claymation of the original. It tells a story that's equally preposterous but far less campy. The characters, while lacking any real depth, are given lines that no longer border on embarrassing. And the action sequences are much more exciting, in large part because of the aforementioned special effects, which are now presented in 3-D. When compared to the original, there really is no comparison.

As a standalone piece, however, it certainly isn't without its weaknesses. The story, while relatively easy to follow, is painfully short on detail, and it generally seems at a distance from the Greek mythology on which it's based. It's nothing more or less than a showcase of CGI, which means you're meant to look at it but not really think about what's going on. I don't mind this, as long as my senses aren't being assaulted; unlike recent big budget effects extravaganzas like ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" and ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,"" ""Clash of the Titans"" allows the audience to take in its visual delights, to savor the effort that went into them. One can watch it and actually be entertained.

The story focuses on a demigod named Perseus (Sam Worthington), born as the result of an affair between a mortal queen and the god Zeus (Liam Neeson). When his beloved adoptive family is killed at the hands of Zeus' wicked brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), Perseus vows that he will have his revenge. He then ends up in the seaside city of Argos, where Queen Cassiopeia (Polly Walker) angers the gods by daring to claim that her daughter, Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), is more beautiful than the goddess Aphrodite. In response to this, Hades gives her two options: Either Argos will be destroyed by a monstrous sea creature known as the Kraken, or Andromeda will be sacrificed. Thus begins Perseus' heroic journey, one that will take him from the cave of the Stygian Witches to the ruined lair of Medusa.

Keeping continuous watch over Perseus is Io (Gemma Arterton), priestess for the goddess Hera. Why she's compelled to protect him is never adequately explained, although I suppose it has something to do with Zeus, who can't seem to decide whether or not Perseus should be helped or harmed. Why harmed? Because he, like the entire city of Argos, has turned his back on the gods and no longer offers his prayers to keep them sustained. I personally find that very immature coming from omnipotent beings, but then again, we find much immaturity and vengefulness in Greek mythology. Consider Artemis: Because a commander named Agamemnon killed a sacred stag, she wouldn't let him or the Greek Fleet sail to Troy unless his daughter, Iphigenia, was sacrificed.

I digress. The truth is that ""Clash of the Titans,"" while hardly a great movie, succeeds at being exactly what it wants to be. One can easily admire the work that went into the visuals, the makeup, the costumes, and the action. One of the most exciting sequences involves a disfigured king named Acrisius (Jason Flemyng), whose body has been fortified by Hades himself; when his blood drips onto the sand, it results in the creation of gigantic scorpions, which then flail wildly as Perseus and his men attack with full force. I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed when it's eventually discovered that these beasts can be tamed and ridden like horses. Where's the fun in that?

And then there's the final sequence with the Kraken, featured prominently in the ads. The ensuing battle is surprisingly short, which, considering the level of technical wizardry on display, is a bit anticlimactic. Still, what little we are shown is exhilarating, aided greatly by the 3-D technology.

Sometimes, it's fun to see a movie that doesn't require the audience to think. It merely wants to entertain you, to take you on a two-hour journey away from life. That's exactly what ""Clash of the Titans"" did for me; it's an escapist film, a delightful distraction that consistently kept me involved. You don't often come across remakes that outshine their predecessors. Then again, when you consider how bad the original ""Clash of the Titans"" was, director Louis Leterrier and the screenwriters didn't have to try all that hard. It sort of makes you wonder, then, why no one thought to wait until now to make this into a movie. If we learned anything from the Ralph Bakshi version of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" it's that we shouldn't force a movie into existence before the technology is available to do the story justice.",1270166400,8,4848,4.856106408706167
4022747,3,B002ZG9788,"Never mind that Clash of the Titans play fast and loose with the mythological story of Perseus. Never mind that Medusa wasn't a Titan. Never mind that the Kraken is from Scandinavian mythology, and that casting Lawrence Olivier as Zeus in the 1981 version was sort of typecasting.

The new Clash of the Titans is a darker, grittier more realistic Bronze age world than the 1981 version, but the story hasn`t changed all that much. The citizens of Argos have become disenchanted with the rule of the Gods. The Gods have caused too much chaos and ruin to their lives so they've decided to take their destinies into their own hands, and destroy the temples and statues of the Gods. In doing so, Perseus'(Sam Worthington) family is killed by a falling statue of Zeus. When Zeus (Liam Neeson) learns of the desecration urged on by Hades (Ralph Fiennes), he decides to destroy the city in four days or they can offer the sacrifice of the King of Argos' daughter Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). In a visit to the throne room of Argos, Hades lets it slip that Perseus is a son of Zeus, a demi-god. Being told of his near divinity, Perseus and a group of soldiers go off on their quest to save the city.

The special effects are great! The monsters look real and the characters realistically interact with them. In 3D the water roiling off the undulating tentacles of the Kraken must look really cool! The problem is they shortchanged the story in favor of the special effects. The story only follows the barest of outlines of the myth. Same with the 1981 version, although it's a little more faithful to the myth. The most glaring lapse is there really isn't any reason for Perseus to save Argos. In the myth his reason to save the city is for the love of Andromeda. In this version he's a stranger to Argos and doesn't fall in love with Andromeda. She's barely a consideration until she's needed to be sacrificed to the Kraken. The only reason he seems to take up the quest is because he's the nearest handy demi-god that can help out. Worthington's Perseus doesn't seem very heroic, there doesn't seem to be any emotional investment in Perseus in either the quest or the surrounding characters. Most of the time he has a stoically sullen, put upon attitude, and this keeps the audience at arms length from the character. He doesn`t seem to embrace the heroic at all. Yes, he kills the monsters, but the tasks he must accomplish like tricking the Stygian witches and figuring out how to survive the encounter with Medusa, he seems to accomplish almost by accident. It seems that Perseus isn't meant to be heroic. he repeatedly says he wants ""to do this (the quest) as man, not a God,"" and he keeps refusing the gifts of the Gods. The message in the myth is for mortals to find the divine, to find the god, the hero within themselves, Perseus' refusal of the gifts of the Gods, is the refusal to find the hero within himself.

The 1981 version, although a bit campy in it's delivery tells the hero's story better. The 2010  version delivers better on the special effects. If such a thing were possible as to merge the strengths of both, you would have a better movie.

4022878,2,B002ZG9788,"The original Clash of the Titans was a fun cheesy swords and sandals film with some charming stop-motion special effects.  The 2010 remake aspires to be more, and falls flat on its face.  The monsters are bigger, the music louder, there's more dirt and mud.  But it's all charmless and forgettable.

The main beats are the same, Perseus, a son of Zeus, goes on a quest to defeat the monstrous Kraken and save the princess.  A new wrinkle is added in that Perseus hates the gods for their trifling with mortal lives and vows to live as a man.  He shuns his divine gifts and fights with his mortal comrades.  Until, y'know the last 10 minutes at which point he jumps on his pegasus, takes out his lightsabre and goes to town.

The whole theme is confused.  The Greek gods are infamously petty and vengeful so a hero who stands up to them is an interesting twist.  But in the end he seems to forget the whole idea.

This can be a fun background movie but not something to seek out.",1522108800,,978,4.348066298342541

4022886,2,B002ZG9788,"Burning question I have after seeing this is how great actors such as Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson could act so wooden. Was it the dismal script or the director?

Anyhoo, on to my review - This might have been higher if I'd not seen the original, but I did.. and so it gets 2 stars.

One star because it was nice to see a movie without nudity and/or sex scene.

The other star was for the graphics - they did a great job with the CGI. However, even with that I kind of felt gypped. It is amazing to me how they brought the Kraken to life in the first one - the imagination, ingenuity and camera work was amazing. And I appreciate what a computer whiz can do with movies nowadays but I just feel it loses something in the translation.

I think it is a bit ironic when Perseus pulls out Bubo and they have him toss him as if, ""Oh, we don't need him.""

4024272,4,B002ZG9788,"3D Review Mostly -- and some thoughts about the latest 3D Conversions:
  Simply NOT as horrible as the naysayers report.  In the past, I remember watching the DVD 2D version, and found the film enjoyable. Since enough time had passed that I forgot most of the story details and since I'm somewhat of a 3D aficionado, I recently purchased a Blu-Ray 3D copy from Amazon at a great discount price. After viewing on a 47"" Passive 3D VIZIO 3D HDTV viewed ~ 3 feet from the screen, I found I enjoyed the movie even more! 3D Depth, colors, and brightness were OK and did not detract from my enjoyment. The defaulted DTS sound track was also enjoyable - my only nit-pick was the dialog volume should have been louder (I viewed with a 4.1 ""phantom"" center speaker layout). In my opinion, it would Not Be Fair to compare this 2010 3D version (2010 Prime Focus conversion) to the ground-breaking Cameron Pace Group 3D films mostly shot in native 3D (2009's Avatar 3D, etc.), since much more planning, time, and money were invested in their 3D development by the pioneering James Cameron himself. Nor would it be fair to compare this 2010 3D version to the Excellent, Excellent, *More Recent* 3D conversions done by Prime Focus which also did parts of Avatar 3D (and produced Gravity,Terminator Genisys - among many others). These days, the 3D Conversion process has advanced to the point of Clearly Rivaling Native 3D filming - again the limiting factor is the amount of 3D planning, time, and money the *Studio* Is Willing To Invest in the production. ** Kudos to Warner Brothers / Legendary Pictures for re-investing more resources to improving the 3D Conversion on this Blu-Ray 3D release!**  I look forward to updating this review further, once I've seen this film on my 3D Projector (an older Optoma GT750 Active- 3D 720p-HD projector) set for a large in-home image format (to be limited by my viewing room's available viewing surface size and viewing distance - I strive to ""Immerse"" myself as much as possible). By-the-way (my personal opinion only), it's probably most helpful to mention the Screen Size, Viewing Distance, HD Resolution,and Viewing Devices used when reviewing these 3D films.",1454371200,,2189,4.8449197860962565

4024275,2,B002ZG9788,"For me, the most surprising aspect about this new
remake of Clash of the Titans was not the 3D itself but the
fact that it turned out to be more bearable of a film for me
to watch knowing in advance all the highly negative reviews
given to it by the critics.  It's not a great film, but I got through
it without any fidgeting on my couch.

The story hasn't changed much since the original 1981 film
starring Harry Hamlin and Laurence Olivier.  Basically, men
are questioning and growing tired of the Gods mistreatment
and cruelty, rising up against them.  In this time a child is
born, a boy destined to change everything. That boy's name
is Perseus (Avatar's Sam Worthington).

While war rages against the Gods, Zeus (Liam Neeson)
is convinced by his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) to release
the Kraken to squelch the revolt by the men of Argos.

It wasn't a good idea to mess with the original 1981 film
that featured the effects work of Ray Harryhausen which
has become something to be worshiped more than the
Gods or heroes of this version which has been muddled
with CGI that has none of the charm of the original stop-motion
effect technology.

One thing I have learned about 3D from people in the industry
is that Directors need to educate themselves how to shoot a
film properly in the format or the results are going to be chaotic.

I say this because Clash of the Titans was not shot for 3D.
What Warner did in an effort to garner more box-office revenue
was to upconvert the film from 2D to 3D.  The downfalls of
doing this kind of conversion can plainly be seen in the final
product.

Clash of the Titans doesn't look horrible in 3D.  It just
doesn't look consistently great.  It's as if the studio labored
hard to optimize the best scenes of the film and then let
others go.  The result is 3D that looks quite passable at
times and at others, you would swear that you were watching
flat 2D.  Sometimes the seams in layers between characters
and background can clearly be seen.

The overall level of separation (perception of depth) is
minimal except for a few key scenes that include the
capturing of Medusa and the rise and defeat of the Kraken.
There's mostly the sense that there is 3D, but the level
of it is quite uneven.

And, because the film was not shot for 3D the effects
work totally ruins the process at times.  You have these
fast-motion battle CGI scenes that come across as blurs
further hindered by shaky camera movement.

There is absolutely no ""In Yo' Face"" 3D to be seen here.
All objects stay squarely within the confines of the screen.

Overall image quality looks perfect with nice earthy tones.

The DTS-MA mix is very robust featuring the score by
Ramin Djawadi.  Lots of underlying bass here with a good
amount of effect noise.  I really enjoyed the use of vocals
across the channels such as a laughing Medusa or the
screeching of winged creatures attacking townspeople.
This is an encompassing mix.

CONCLUSION

My best advice here is that if you already own the
standard Blu-ray of Clash of the Titans there is no real
reason to upgrade as the 3D adds very little enhancement.",1453075200,,3116,4.533094812164579

4024518,1,B002ZG9788,"It is now November 2015, and I didn't see this in 3D when it was released in 2010. In the five years since it's release in 3D, it has become the poster child for horribly bad 3D conversions. Since I had never seen it in 3D, I decided to judge for myself. Of course, 3D conversion technology has improved so much since COTT was released, that it's now virtually impossible to tell the films shot in 3D from the good conversions. This was certainly not the case in 2010. I have a collection of almost all the 3D films that have been released on Blu-ray, so I've become quite an aficionado. I've rarely seen a bad conversion except, of course, those German ""conversions"" that are as good, or bad, as a Blu-ray player's 2D to 3D converters.

I had read some pretty scathing reviews about the 3D conversion of COTT, but I was determined to keep an open mind and just let the film suspend my disbelief for a couple hours. My final verdict on the 3D...C-.  It wasn't as bad as some of the hype would lead one to believe, but it wasn't very good. I immediately noticed parallax problems making it almost impossible to focus on some objects. This didn't occur often, but it was enough to remind me that it was a conversion. Another more glaring problem was background objects appearing as foreground objects and vice versa. Mistakes like that tended to destroy the suspension of disbelief thing. There were also shots when the conversion editors didn't even bother, and left the image in 2D.

I am an avid 3D fan, but not to the point that I'll choose to watch bad 3D. COTT is a fairly entertaining film in 2D. Unfortunately, the 3D conversion detracts from it, making it more difficult to suspend one's disbelief, and enjoy it as the filmmakers intended. I'm very glad that 3D conversion technology has improved by leaps and bounds since COTT was released. As with any aspect of a film, from lighting, cinematography, special effects, music, script, to 3D and so on, they should always contribute to the successful telling of a story. By calling attention to itself, the 3D in COTT breaks that cardinal filmmaking rule.",1446854400,,2111,4.594164456233422

4024696,3,B002ZG9788,"As a whole people have a difficult time accepting help whether it be from friend or foe. Generally speaking, a person carries emotional baggage with them that affects their decisions for good and for bad. A large part of this baggage is passed down to us by our parents and those who influenced our lives early on. Sometimes this results in the acceptance of help and other times it compels us to refuse help out of pride, shame or any number of secondary emotions.

 These thoughts coalesced during a secondary viewing of remake of the film, ""Clash of the Titans"". While the movie did fail on many levels, what it did get right was the above message. Perseus throughout the entire story, refused his father, Zeus' assistance. In his mind he needed to prove and to know and that he wasn't like the other gods and that a human could accomplish great deeds. Only once, he was able to cut off Medusa's head without godly assistance was he able to accept that he could allow Zeus' offerings; a Pegasus and a sword.

 This is not something that is exclusive to a narrative. Everyday we make decisions that have the potential to be based on qualities passed onto us that he feel shame or pride in. Often, these decisions limit our potential and what we are able to accomplish in our lifetime. On the extreme end of that, those who cannot cope with their baggage may even descend into a lesser life lived. There is no one path for a person to take in order to work through this baggage and achieve happiness. It is accomplished through trial and error. One person may have to reconcile their feeling about a perceived inadequate parent while another person has to cut a monster's head off. It's all a matter of interpretation.",1440374400,,1719,4.571428571428571

4025294,3,B002ZG9788,"This movie tells the story of Greek hero Perseus who battles creatures and monsters along the way in order to stop Hades from conquering Heaven and earth.

 This film has some great choreographed action scenes using CGI. The plot leads you along at a fairly good pace but you tend to notice that it wants to hurry up and just get to the fight scenes making the characters seem like cardboard and the entire story seem quite a bit rushed. With something like this epic adventure story they should have spent a little more time in developing the characters. But then again, all things become politics when it comes to Hollywood.

I enjoyed the movie but they could have slowed it down a notch to render out the characters. This is an entertaining movie but it's just okay overall.",1424131200,,778,4.58273381294964

4026035,2,B002ZG9788,"It's admittedly a great concept and has stunning visuals, but the plot falls apart spectacularly by the end. The central quest is that of Perseus, who seeks to bring ruin to the gods by destroying their most formidable weapon, the Kraken. At the beginning of the film, in response to growing acts of defiance on the part of humanity, Zeus threatens to unleash the monster unless the Argosian queen sacrifices her daughter in penance for comparing her beauty to the goddess Aphrodite. Unfortunately for Zeus, his brother, Hades, happens to have recently killed the entire adopted family of our hero, Perseus, in a botched attempt to quell human resistance. The film then proceeds to introduce the concept that the gods only have power so long as humans continue to worship them, and foreshadows (several times) that humans will one day overthrow the gods and rule the earth. It's the perfect setup for a Kill Bill-style revenge flick where Perseus takes down the gods one by one, but instead the film takes a different direction and Perseus sets out to claim the head of Medusa, the one secret weapon that can kill the Kraken. For some unfathomable reason (related to bad script writing), Zeus, who finds out that Perseus is his long-lost bastard child, showers him with gifts such as a magic sword and a flying Pegasus in order to aid him on his quest to defeat... um, himself? After about an hour of journeying across sea, desert, and Underworld to retrieve the head, Zeus orders Hades to unleash the Kraken and bring doom upon Argos. Of course, our hero arrives just in time to slay the beast, save the city, and tell the gods exactly where they can shove the remains. Oh wait, then that means Zeus is the bad guy... So, at the last minute, Hades betrays the gods and reveals that he, in fact, was the real bad guy after all! (His motivations for doing this make no sense at all, and are weakly explained away by revealing that Hades feeds off of humanity's fear, rather than worship.) After realizing that he was being played the whole time by Hades, Zeus undergoes a magical transformation into the stereotypical loving father, who roots for his kid even if they don't agree on who should rule the universe. So Perseus manages to foil Zeus' grand scheme to keep humanity at bay while making Zeus proud of his son in the process. It's an absolute mess of a storyline from start to finish, but at least it tried to do something original, right?",1411689600,,2446,4.664351851851852

4026352,1,B002ZG9788,"No, I didn't buy it, I borrowed from the library first. Glad I did! I won't be buying it.

I loved the original movie, though its effects are dated by today's standards. The original Greek Myth should be read and enjoyed, if you think you like this version...you won't feel the same once you hear the real way the story should go. Granted, no movie can satisfy the readers of novels turned to film, since much is lost to time constraints. Sure, writers use ""artistic license"" to simplify parts of a long story for screenplay performance.

BUT this was not license, it was assault. The story was largely lost, the drama ruined, the humans too ""modern"" in attitude and values. They destroyed the adventure, romance, excitement, and flow. The characters' behavior is inappropriate for Ancient Greeks and soldiers.

Examples:
1) the evil king who cast Perseus' mother into the sea was also the cruel, disfigured prince Calibos, who was engaged to princess Andromeda before he got uglified by a god.
2) Perseus' mother is the queen of the evil king in this version. The real story says it was the king's stunningly beautiful, virgin daughter who Zeus impregnated.
3) Perseus has a major attitude about being a demigod. Like nearly all the other characters, he resents and hates the gods, even his father Zeus. In the real story, people respect the gods in general, and consequences for insulting them are swift. Perseus does not have ""daddy issues"".
4) Perseus refuses the gifts from Olympus in the new version - in the original, he accepts and uses them eagerly.
5) Hades has nothing to do with Perseus' family, nor does he control the Kraken Titan. The real story has Poseidon command the Kraken.
6) It is not the blood of Calibos that made scorpions in the real story, even though he was a demigod too - son of goddess Thetis. It was Medusa's.
7) There are no magic using jinn to rescue Perseus in the real story, and nobody rides scorpions.
8) The Greeks are not revolting against divine rule by the gods, in the mythology. That's a 21st century mentality of anarchy and self-supremacy, defying gods and monsters alike.
9) The real story doesn't have a crazed Hades fanatic trying to get the people to stop Perseus from killing the Titan.
10) the real story has a HAPPY, satisfying ending: Perseus marries fair Andromeda, whom he saved from the Kraken, and the gods grant peace to the city and the couple. In the new movie - none of this positive stuff happens.

This is what we writers call a ""twisted"" story. That means no clear good and evil, and the audience is left feeling unresolved emotions, and some confusion, because the story has no real hero, conclusive victory over evil, or triumph of good. The hero and heroine don't have a happy OR well-deserved outcome. Thus, this is a LOUSY hack of the Perseus Myth.

The Pegasi are lovely, but the black stallion is not part of the myth. Also - Calibos killed all but Pegasus in the original myth. Without even the golden bridle, Perseus just goes up and pets him, once Io (another immortal cursed by a god) calms the stallion a bit.

Didn't like how the Kraken resembles a sea turtle with a flattened face and tentacles. Didn't like Hades being so prominent a character - he didn't need to be added to the tale. Not much seen of the monster special effects either - the old movie had a longer battle between Perseus and Kraken.

Lots more I could point out is wrong. Just advise you to get the old version or read the story instead of buying the 2010 one.",1400716800,,3509,4.6048
4026353,5,B002ZG9788,"I enjoyed this movie because the main character, son of a god, was not looking to be a hero, i.e., he was humble and heroic. He was brave and compassionate, and so when the call to duty came, he naturally took it up. There is loads of excitement from the beginning of the movie when Perseus is discovered at sea and adopted, til the moment when he finds out he's a god, accepts his fate and embarks on a dangerous journey. There is a lot going on in this movie: lover, murder, betrayal, family values, loyalty and heroism. I recommend it.",1400544000,,538,4.336633663366337

4026415,3,B002ZG9788,"When it comes to Ray Harryhausen there is no bigger fan of his work and films. When I heard about this remake I was excited, but after reading many reviews I decided to wait until it came on cable before seeing it. I happened to come across this Blu Ray very cheap and I took a chance. To my surprise, this remake isn't as bad as many have claimed, but does nothing to improve on the original either.

The special effects are a highlight in both versions, but in this film they are used sparingly. You never get a good look at the monsters, only quick cuts and fast motion I assume to hide the cracks in the CGI work? I know the younger generation see Ray Harryhausen's(RH)work as old fashioned or even quaint, but he is one of the pioneers of the craft and has and will continue to inspire generations of film makers long after this remake disappears into obscurity. It was fitting of the makers of this fim to put in a cameo of BoBo the owl as a nod to RH.

The story has been changed, but not for the better, only adding confusion and depriving us of a real hero. In RH's original film the story was more straightforward and even though a little corny at times, it did a better job of keeping the motives of the characters more believable.

Back to the special effects as this is really the reason to watch any Harryhausen film remake or not. I'm glad that they kept RH's design for Medusa as is it one of the coolest interpretations of her, even though not accurate by Mythological standards. As far as RH's stop motion work, I really don't think people are aware of the amount of work that RH put into the Medusa sequence in the original. Medusa's snake filled hair, her tail and all body movements are painstakingly done with the upmost finesse and skill. Even more amazing is that the flame lit lair is also something he had to take into consideration. Switching the light reflection frame by frame to make it look like flames flickering. Add in the fact the man was in the twilight of his career at almost 70 years old! It was nothing short of breathing taking in its time and I doubt it could ever be duplicated. If we factor in the money and time allowed to create this and all the other creature effects, it is unbelievable that it was completed. I would have loved to see what he could have done with a budget of the remake!

The Medusa in this film looks very good, but I think there is more tension in the original scene with her slowly stalking her intruders. In fact, most of the creatures in this remake serve only as a reminder of how great Harryhausen was at his craft, giving his creatures life and personality. The original film suffers from budget restraints that actually effect the look of the film, as all the prints I've seen of it are dark, grainy and the matte shots stick out like a sore thumb, so naturally this remake looks incredible by comparison.

The original has more creatures and the story is told in a more entertaining way, but the remake has some impressive special effects and a story that is not as corny. If only we could combine the two to make one great film. Clash of the Titans is a solid action adventure film with some nifty effects, but I will watch RH's version far more times than this one.",1399593600,,3243,4.353719008264463

""Let us ride these scorpions so we can make up time!... but we will only move at about 5mph"". ""I refuse to use an epic sword sent by the Gods... because, screw it, that's why!

I'm okay with that. I feel that in this day and age it is very rare for a movie to be exactly like its book counterpart, or in this case myth.  With that said, here are some things I did not particularly like about this remake.  First off I don't like how the concept of life on Earth being a game to the Gods was downplayed.  It seemed like they were a bit more human themselves, and not so much ""arrogant gods"" who don't really think about consequences.  They have the big ""game board"" and even have the pieces for each character, but you never really see them manipulating anyone like a game.  Next off is Perseus' hair.  A buzz-cut? really? Lastly I did not really appreciate the Bobo cameo, I felt it mocked the original movie more than paying tribute. Those are my biggest complaints, barely complaints really. This movie is GORGEOUS, fun, and full of great fantasy situations. Medusa looked fantastic (although not frightening), and the Kraken was simply amazing.

The only upside in the movie was the chance to see Pete Postlethwaite at work one more time.

Oddly, its sequel, Wrath of the Titans, had a better script and was in general a better movie.

Update:
After watching the second time I have to say the special effects were generally better than my first impression. It's difficult to be objective when the script is torturing one.

4026743,4,B002ZG9788,"This remake of the Clash of the Titans is relatively exciting and features some interesting special effects and constitutes a remarkable improvement over the original. Be sure to check out the bonus features as it includes the best making of documentary I have ever seen.

The story revolves around the quest by Perseus, played by Sam Worthington, to search for a way to defeat the Kraken, a beast released by Hades, the defeated brother of Zeus - who had been cast into the underworld for his defiance to Zeus' rule, who had insidiously convinced Zeus to allow him to release the monster to instil fear in Man, after they had been led by the king to abandon worship of their Greek Gods whom they felt had not made a significant contribution to their lives, in an attempt to win back their obeisance. The quest takes Perseus, who is a demi-God, bearing the blood of Zeus - who had tricked Perseus' father's wife into having sexual intercourse with him as a punishment for his father's defiance of Zeus' will, to the three evil witches - who are tricked by Perseus into revealing the manner in which the Kraken can be defeated, which is through a look by Medusa, whose very gaze can turn anything into stone. The entire movie is about the quest for answers and the attempt to save the king's daughter, whose sacrifice Hades had offered to Man as means of calling off the Kraken, by securing the head of the Medusa to turn the Kraken into stone. The story is simplicity in itself and is a rather lame attempt to put together a quest that will avail the director the opportunity to introduce 3D generated CGI action that thrills and excites. In this they have succeeded remarkably well as the movie is a dramatic improvement over the original which utilized jerky stop-motion photography that rendered the creatures unrealistic and made them resemble the toy scale models upon which the entire movie relied.

On the overall, the exciting action sequences and the stupendous 3D makes the movie a worthwhile watch.",1388966400,2,2009,4.720797720797721

4026982,3,B002ZG9788,"I went to see Clash when it first hit the theaters.  I remember sitting there more or less bored, and wondering about a real plot. For the most part I was not entertained by this movie.  Nice special effects, but then there is no real story. Interesting that a Norweigan fable character is included.  I was surprised that Liam Nesson & Ralph Fiennes would want to be a part of this production.  I remember that Liam Nesson lost his wife in 2009, so I felt that maybe this had something to do with his seeming disconnection with the part.

What was the real reason for Perseus taking on the quest?  He did not know the  princess?  He had no real connection with the people of Argos?  To think he could get some real revenge over Hades who sweeps into the palace in a black cloud with fire, and all the soldiers are sucked into the black storm & fire onto their death.  Hades  touches the queen's face and  she turns into an old women and dies on the floor next to the king .  Hades demands that the princess be sacrificed to the Kraken within 10 days, at which point (after Hades reveals who Perseus really is) Perseus and a group of soldiers take off on the quest to cut off Medusa's head so that the Kraken can be turned to stone.  Yada, yada, yada, yada.

4026987,3,B002ZG9788,"I'm somewhat of a mythology enthusiast, so I had to watch the movie.  While I was entertained, I really wasn't that impressed.  Perhaps my expectations were more centered around the mythology as depicted by Homer, but they got a few of the characters right.

Basically, this is a remake of the 1981 ""Clash of the Titans,"" a movie inspired by Perseus from Greek Mythology.  This 2010 release was later followed by the 2012 sequel, ""Wrath of the Titans.""  It's a good idea to have a little background going into the movie; when the gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades defeated the titans (the titans are the parents of the gods), these three split the realm for rule amongst themselves.  Poseidon commands the seas, Zeus the skies and heavens, but Hades, who felt tricked into his spoils, came to rule the underworld.  Because the power and immortality of the gods is fed by the faith of mortals, much of Greek Mythology centers around the gods attempting to trick mortals into abandoning one god for another.  And here is where the movie begins....

However it came about, mortals eventually began to lose faith in the gods and Olympus altogether, but some take it a bit further and choose to smite the gods.  Perseus, a young man, is fishing with his family when Argos soldiers desecrate a memorial to Zeus.  In retaliation, Olympus sends the Furies to punish these men.  As collateral damage, Perseus' fishing boat is destroyed, killing his entire family.  The soldiers retrieve Perseus from the wreckage and bring him to the court of King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia so he may witness further, royal smiting.

While among the court, Cassiopeia belligerently belittles Aphrodite by declaring her daughter, Andromeda, to be more beautiful.  [Enter Hades]  Hades appears before the court to display the power of the gods.  To punish the mortals, Hades calls for Andromeda to be sacrificed; if the mortals refuse, the Kraken will be unleashed on the city of Agros.  DUN DUN DUN... there's more.  Hades can't help but notice Perseus among the mortals, and perhaps this is Hades' own form of passive-aggressive revenge, but he just can't help exposing Perseus as a son of Zeus and demigod.  [I'll add that this isn't exactly how things happened in Mythological literature; this would be the point where Juno/Hera gets infuriated over Zeus's infidelity and unleashes her own wrath.]

To help unravel Perseus' new identity, the nymph and Priestess of Hera in Argos, Io, visits Perseus.  She helps to put a few things into perspective for the new demigod and charges him to be the only one who might save the mortals from the gods.  Now that Perseus has been given his quest, he must venture to find the Stygian Witches in order to learn how to defeat the Kraken.  Meanwhile, we get a peek into Hades' true plot.  Zeus then finds his son, Perseus, and offers him a gift to assist him in his quest (Zeus no longer wishes for Hades' plot to go through).  Zeus grants to Perseus the Pegasus and an Olympian sword--still angry at his absent father, Perseus shuns the gifts for a while.

[Spoiler alert:  Stop reading here if you don't want to know what happens]  Perseus uses his wit to trick the witches into revealing how the Kraken might be defeated; Perseus must seek Medusa's head which can be used to turn the Kraken into stone.  To find Medusa, Perseus and his gang (Io included?) gain passage into the underworld.  Pretty much everyone dies in this trial, Perseus being the exception.  This is a pretty important part of the movie because it is a turning point for Perseus; he begins to understand who he is and how he must use his powers.  From here on out, Perseus and Zeus work on their father-son relationship (to the dismay of Ares, but that's another story).  As Perseus mounts Pegasus, he couldn't look any more godly than as he rides off to save Andromeda, slay the Kraken, and release Zeus from the grip of Hades.",1382400000,,3915,4.742603550295858

4027871,1,B002ZG9788,"""Clash of the Titans"" is a truly amazing film -- never before have I seen a movie that is so BUSY, and yet so staggeringly DULL.

This stupid movie was apparently made to cash in on the wild success of 300, but it pretty much missed everything that made that movie enjoyable. Instead, this remake of the classic cult film is full of everything and nothing -- Louis Leterrier crams it with horrible acting, endless CGI, and an obnoxiously preachy plot that ends up being brain-bleedingly boring.

A fisherman finds a floating coffin, which holds a dead princess and a still-living baby. He adopts the child, Perseus (Sam Worthington), and raises him as well -- until the god Hades (Ralph Fiennes) destroys Perseus' family and fishing boat. He's marched to the city of Argos, where he sees the king and queen declare war on the gods...

... only to have Hades proclaim that if Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is not sacrificed within ten days, the kraken will destroy Argos. A mysterious woman named Io (Gemma Arterton) tells Perseus that he is actually the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), and is the only hope of slaying the kraken and saving Argos.

Honestly, the story of Perseus is one of the awesomest, most movieworthy stories in Greek mythology -- you've got a demigod hero, a sea monster, a flying horse, and a snake-headed creature that turns people to stone. But apparently, THAT story isn't good enough for the people in Hollywood. They even mock the original movie in one scene involving the mechanical owl Bubo.

Instead director Leterrier crams all sorts of weird random stuff into the movie -- it's a constant onslaught of giant scorpions, CGI monsters, djinni, and witches who look like Guillermo del Toro discards. The plot feels skeletal and bloated at the same time, with horribly silly dialogue (""It is death who should be afraid of us!"") and dozeworthy action scenes.

Even worse, the screenwriters seem hell-bent on pushing their own theological philosophy on us (""God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him"") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of ""We hate the gods! Gods are awful! Let's stupidly anger them even though they're incredibly powerful!""... only for them to undermine their own message in the last reel.

And really, how can you go wrong when you have Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in your movie, playing GODS? Well, you can cast the bland lump that is Sam Worthington as your lead, a pouting prettyboy who brings no charisma to his role, giving Neeson nothing to do except throw divine tantrums, and Fiennes nothing to do except slink around being vaguely sinister (since a god of death HAS to be evil, right? WRONG!). As for Gemma Arterton, she just sort of wanders in and out of the story, serving as a source of convenient information -- a complete waste.

""Clash of the Titans"" would be better titled ""Flush of the Titans"" -- a reeking lump of brainless cinema that stupefies even as it preaches. The original is flawed, but infinitely superior to this one.",1365120000,3,3004,4.808139534883721

Not a big deal on the first time around, but I shouldn't have to sit through them every time I load up the disc. If I ever decide to watch it again, my first thought will probably be ""Do I want to sit through all those previews again?"" It is possible to fast forward through these one by one, but again that is a pain.

The other complaint I have is the lack of chapters in the menu. That means skipping ahead is nowhere near as easy as it should be. Lots of fast fowarding through previous scenes. It brought me back to the days of VHS.",1359072000,,888,4.187134502923977

4028572,1,B002ZG9788,"As a high schooler, I read a book in english class about greek mythology, and I absolutely loved it! And when I saw that they had did a remake of Clash of the titans, I just had to see it! And man was that a mistake, I actually wanted to strangle the popcorn guy. I was a fan of the original masterpiece, but this remake was so bad I was at the verge of crying.

Story: The basic story to this film is perseus, the mortal son of Zeus, who is the son of Chronos, is out to battle minions of the underworld and stop them from conquering the world. What I find disappointing is that there is no in depth story. They are mashing events together, and in the end, it turns all out into a mess. The story ""does not"" drag, and that's exactly the problem, instead they are rushing everything. The kraken was shown for like 2 minutes. They don't go in depth on the gods themselves. The writing was just bad.

Acting: Hammy, mediocre acting by Sam Worthington (Perseus), and I like Sam Worthington don't get me wrong, but I felt he wasn't putting enough effort into the role of Perseus, I felt as if he was just walking through the film, without giving enough emotion. Liam Neeson (Zeus), I think we all love Liam Neeson, but it seemed as if he was overacting in this film. Why he was in this? I will never understand, did he really need the paycheck that badly? Regardless, it wasn't neither of the actors fault, as much as it was the director's and writer's.

Effects/Cgi: The cgi was terrible! It was something you'd get on the Syfy channel. Medusa was poorly animated, when Perseus chopped her head off, it was obvious animation. The original Ray Harryhausen masterpiece had stop animation, and I know times have changed, and I don't have a problem with cgi, but atleast make the cgi look good. The kraken didn't look anything like the original kraken, the original kraken looked like a Hydra, this kraken looked like.... whatever the hell that thing was supposed to be. Also, nearly every setting, place, or thing was cgi, no joke.

Casting: Almost universally bad casting! I like Sam Worthington, but as perseus? He didn't even have the haircut, or try to hide his australian accent. They couldn't have chose someone better? I'll admit the gods were decently casted, the problem was they didn't act like the gods, they lacked representation from the mythological characters.

Verdict: Waste of potential, the writers were not thinking well when they made this script. You can't remake a masterpiece and turn it into garbage. They gave roles to actors who shouldn't have even been in this film, people if you still have yet to see the original, and you haven't seen this version either, please do NOT watch this version first! I actually have people in my high school who think this is better than the original, and that the original looked stupid, I mean normally I would say you are entitled to your own opinion, but this film is so bad. Whatever, you're entitled to your opinion, just please watch the original.",1356825600,,3008,4.562962962962963

- One of his honor guard, abruptly: ""Just leave it!""

I hope you didn't watch either versions of CLASH OF THE TITANS to prep for a Greek mythology exam, because it's gonna get ugly when the test results come in. If I had to choose I guess I'd roll with the original 1981 version, because it came first and because it featured Ray Harryhausen's vintage stop-motion magic and the hotness of Judi Bowker and that dang cute metal owl (which, awesomely, is referenced in the 2010 reimagining). Still, flaws and all, this new version has got its boasting moments. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this most recent CLASH OF THE TITANS.

Sam Worthington has a presence, but it's more your stolid, taciturn, seething sort. It's understandable, given that his character, Perseus, is a young fisherman whose parents and sister have just been struck down by the god of the Underworld. Never mind that their deaths were more incidental than anything, given that Hades (Ralph Fiennes) was targeting a slew of warriors who had just torn down a statue of Zeus.

Zeus, head of the Greek pantheon, created man so that the gods could grow strong from man's worship. But Zeus (Liam Neeson) created man in his image. Why was he taken aback when man grew arrogant and prideful? As the film opens, mortals are in rebellion against the gods. And when Queen Cassiopeia of Argos, at her height of folly, brags of her daughter Andromeda's beauty eclipsing even that of Aphrodite, the gods have had enough. Hades swoops down and does something awful to the queen and then pronounces Argos's doom: In ten days the monstrous Kraken will be unleashed... unless Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is sacrificed.

The nation of Argos has one hope. Perseus in their midst is discovered to be a demi-god, the son of Zeus himself. The king of Argos beseeches Perseus to play savior. But Perseus has eyes only for revenge for his family's deaths. And since there is a converging point between his goals and that of the king, he takes up the cause. He's given an escort of soldiers. Off they go to negate what Cassiopeia's brag has wrought. Perseus is guided by Io (Gemma Arterton), an ageless woman who'd been safeguarding him all his life.

If you want to enjoy this film, you simply can't obsess on plot holes. You'll find oodles (one example: the murderous but then suddenly tame monster scorpions). The narrative shortcut of the deux ex machina is in full effect (cough*Pegasus*cough). CLASH OF THE TITANS is a triumph of technical craftsmanship. The expert CG overshadows the standard caliber of acting put in even by luminaries like Fiennes and Neeson. I personally think Mads Mikkelson is the best actor of the lot, playing the jaded, cynical Argosian soldier Draco. Sam Worthington, sporting a daring buzz cut in a world of shaggy hair and runaway beards, manifests his character's demigod ambiguity. Since Perseus hails from divinity, maybe it makes sense that he suddenly exhibits spectacular martial prowess for a simple fisherman. Still, I'm fond of these goofy Greek mythologies come to life. CLASH OF THE TITANS is a popcorn flick, fantastic focus on action, dismissive of coherent narrative continuity. Sit back and watch as the relentless Perseus and his steadily dwindling honor guard fight off a gauntlet of slick computer generated monsters. But I sort of miss Ray Harryhausen's stuff. And Judi Bowker. And that cute metallic owl.",1356134400,,3450,4.860544217687075

4028811,3,B002ZG9788,"For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...

This Clash Of The Titans (2010) movie is a remake of the original version that came out in 1981.  Yes, of course if you're on your toes in this day and age you can predict that there's bound to be a remake of a movie once a movie gets to be 25-30 years old, or perhaps 50 years old.  Clash Of The Titans is no exception.  I have mixed feelings about this remake.  On the one hand, it's good visually.  On the other hand, it ISN'T good visually because the CGI looks so fake.  The movie, especially the action scenes, looks like a video game, so much that it got to the point that it was distracting.  If CGI is going to be used, it should look as real and believable as possible.  This is not the case here.  There have been other movies in recent years that have good to great CGI, such as the remake of The Wolfman (just off the top of my head).  When it comes to the actors, I liked the actors in the original Clash Of The Titans better.  You know - Burgess Meredith, Claire Bloom, Laurence Olivier, on and on.

There is a certain purity that is missing here that the original had.  Maybe it's the stop motion animation of the original, which obviously looks fake, but low tech effects always look fake, so one can't really expect much in the way of realism.  Maybe it's the sets vs. a lot of green screen.  All I know is that there's something missing and everything seems so artificial.

If you want to see the better of the two movies (in my opinion), see the original with its stop motion animation, better story, and better cast.",1352592000,,1648,4.227564102564102

4028965,5,B002ZG9788,"We enjoyed this film tremendously.  In fact, I appreciated the improbability of the action, but it still is great fun.  We are watching mythical gods here and their foibles and caprices.  What had us totally immersed was the beauty of the visuals.  Truly stunning sets and marvelous computer-generated images, in a way they made me think of an up-to-date of the dream-like engravings by Gustave Dore - also truly fantastic.  You see a world just created and still in evolution, where the elements are still in the upheavals of development: vast, yet untamed forces in a giant but yet untamed universe.

(Perhaps the only misstep is the army-like haircut of Perseus.  Gods are never portrayed without abundant hair in Greek statuary.)

A miles-ahead improvement on the original Clash of the Titans, where you could feel the clumsy sets and hilarious ""gods.""

To fair, it's not Neeson's fault that he has such horrible storytellers - an even worse director and special effects that are so painfully obvious, you feel like you are watching a computer game rather than a major motion picture. I have all the respect in the world for the leading actors of the cast but this is just such a monumental waste of time. You can't care about the main characters much less the villains, the sense of danger is laughable and the single redeeming feature of this entire film is 'release the Kraken!!!'",1348444800,,623,4.473684210526316

4028969,4,B002ZG9788,"I liked this version of ""Clash of the Titans"".  I saw the original 1980 version in the theatre when it came out and liked it as well.  I saw this one in the theatre and on DVD.  I like ancient history/mythology type movies in general and I have to say I enjoyed this version.  I know a lot of reviews criticize it for not following the actual myth of Perseus, but that didn't bother me really, and I didn't watch it for that.  For me, when I watch movies like ""Clash"", a lot of it depends on what I'm watching for.  For instance, lets take the Trojan war ... if I'm feeling romantic, and ""sappy"", then I'd watch the 1956 Rosanna Podesta version of ""Helen of Troy"" ... if I want historical reference and clarity of story, then I'd watch USA's 2004 version of ""Helen of Troy"", but if I'm watching for the glory of Hollywood and gorgeous sets and costumes and beautiful people, then I'd watch ""Troy"" with Brad Pitt. In this case, I wanted to see great monsters (because I like those type of movies as well, like Jurassic Park 1, 2 and 3) and what they did with Medusa ... and I think they did a great job.  I wasn't watching for story content or for clarity on which god was which.  And Sam Worthington made a very attractive Perseus.",1346889600,2,1231,4.253218884120171

We actually took it out and put in Wrath of the Titans, and man, what a difference. When something is really supposed to be in 3D, you can tell. Clash, I'm afraid has dissappointed me greatly. Depth and quality of 3D is very important. The 3D in this is flat and distorted. 3D features that are supposed to fly out at you become distorted and digitally grainy. What a shame because it had such awesome potential. If you want a great 3D movie, get Wrath of the Titans. That will make you say, Whoa. Anyone who writes that this version isn't too bad obviously has not indulged in marvelous 3D films on a 65"" flat screen in the comfort of their own home or something, because they are dead wrong.

4029128,3,B002ZG9788,"Overall, a decent movie, visually and story-wise. Not great, but not bad (story-wise it was better than Tintin).
The summary, a dude, tries to save a cute chick, from death, but he doesn't have a great relationship with his dad so he shuns his dad's help. Okay, that was a really loose summary, but hopefully you already know the story.
First, the bad, the story needed some more work. Stronger main character, better dialogue (though there were some really good moments), and more emotional drama to hook me into the story. There were some really weak moments, Visual Effects wise, which leads me to believe they had a limited budget for VFX. So, what does the mean? It means that some of the VFX were smokin hot, and others were sort of a dud (not dude). The problem with that, is we (the audience) notice the inconsistency, not good. And the love story sort of at the end, needed more development during. Come on, make us burn to have those two ""hook-up"" (like Mulder & Scully).
The good, well the action sequences were incredible, not just the VFX (the good VFX) but the directing. Very good. Some fantastic VFX. Seriously.
So, based on all that, I would purchase this for my library. Understanding, though the original movie, was better story wise.",1342569600,,1253,4.67420814479638

Forget great acting, and purchase this for an engaging story, great costumes, spectacular sets and special effects. The cover shows the scorpion attack that appears in the middle of the film and really holds the entire story together. The spectacular special effects ending with the attack of the monstrous Kraken is not a let down at all either! I imagine many viewers oaf the original film from a decade or so back will be a bit let down that the owl is not brought into the fracas. They do pay homage to it at the owl appears briefly and is dismissed as being unimportant. This was a box office hit and did about 30% better than the current Wrath of the Titans which was more or less about the same without an engaging story. If you were to choose this one or the other, this is the better choice. See my review of the Wrath of the Titans to understand the differences. FOUR STARS",1341014400,,1048,4.37948717948718

4029132,3,B002ZG9788,"I will break down ths review by story, presentation and critic. Clash of the Titans begins with a recap of the unseen war between the Titans and the Olympians in which Hades creates the Kraken from his flesh and defeats the Titans yet still is swindled from his place as ruler of Olympus by his brother Zeus. The Gods rule the world from Mt. Olympus and need the prayers of mortals to sustain them, however, fed up with the Gods, mortals have begun to foresake them and thus set up the events of the film. Perseus, the son of Zeus, witnesses his family die and seeks revenge against Hades. Meanwhile, Hades threatens to unleash the Kraken unless Andromeda is sacrificed and Perseus must make a perilous journey to claim the head of Medusa in order to fight the Kraken.

The movie is visually wonderful, I did not care so much for the 3D effects but it looks nice on Blu-ray. The action sequences are intense, the Kraken is massive and Sam Worthington gives us a good performance. Early in the film, you can see he is a simple man who loves his family and appreciates all that life has given him, as his family is taken away from him, his sole purpose is to avenge them and he never loses sight of his purpose. The sound quaility is good and the scenes on Olympus are stunning and the lighting gives a regal yet divine feel to the scene.

The story is where this movie is at it's weakest. I assume the writer went to the George Lucas School of Writing. I understand this is not a remake but rather a relaunch for a potential movie trilogy but the mythology is lost and given a bad sci-fi movie of the week tone. The Gods need prayers to answer humanity's requests but humanity refuses to pray because the Gods don't answer so the Gods are weaken and are unable to respond until they get prayers, see the problem? Hades makes the Kraken which killed the Titans, then why didn't he use the Kraken to muscle Zeus out of Olympus in the first place? There was no romance between Andromeda and Perseus so there was no sense of urgency to protect her. There are lots of plotholes but if you don't take them to heart, this is a good movie and a good way to spend a weekend afternoon.",1340582400,,2174,4.352216748768473
4029243,3,B002ZG9788,"Very Post-Modern!  It's an original take on the traditional story theme of man vs. gods.  The gods only exist because humanity worships them.  If we don't worship them, then the gods will presumably die, though they don't necessarily say this.  So humanity makes a war on the gods and stops worshiping them.  In comes our hero, who is part-god but wishes to deny that reality.  The special effects are better than the original, but I got to say, I enjoy the original still better.  All in all, it is entertaining . . .",1340496000,,518,4.505376344086022

4029245,3,B002ZG9788,"I admit that I somewhat enjoyed this swords-and-sandals action flick when I saw it in theaters a couple of years ago, hence the three stars, but having done some research on the original mythology, I'm upset over how they cast Andromeda, Perseus's love interest. In the original Greek myths, Andromeda was a princess from ""Aethiopia"", which is what the Greeks called Sudan---which as everyone should know by now is a tropical African country. In fact the very word ""Aethiopia"" meant ""burnt faces"" in reference to the inhabitants' skin color. Thereby Andromeda would have been a dark-skinned African woman, not Nordic-looking as portrayed in Clash. By depicting Andromeda as white in spite of the original mythology, the filmmakers eschewed a chance to have a more multicultural cast starring a European male/African female couple in favor of a generic white female love interest, which is insulting to black women. The action and special effects may be good but I cannot forgive such borderline racist casting and will boycott the franchise until they get Andromeda's ethnicity right.",1338940800,6,1084,5.235632183908046

4029248,4,B002ZG9788,"If you have fond memories of Ray Harryhausen's 1981 version, you owe it to yourself to see what 30 years of technological advances have done for adventure movies involving fantastic monsters. They're fantastic!

No doubt you know the story by now, although this version has some interesting twists. Perseus (Sam Worthington) is a demi-god: Zeus (Liam Neeson) was his father by a human mother. A queen, in fact. Zeus disguised himself as her husband and . . . Well, anyway, Perseus was raised by a fisherman and his family who were killed when some uppity soldiers tore down a statue of Zeus.

Hades (Ralph Fiennes, who also played Lord Voldemort) gets angry at how uppity the humans are getting, and tells his brother Zeus he will teach them humility. He points out that while Zeus feeds on the humans' prayers and love, Hades lives on their fear.

Anyway, Hades threatens to unleash the Kraken, a huge horrible monster, who can only be placated by the sacrifice of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), while Perseus has concluded that it is his destiny to slay the Kraken. But first he needs to defeat Medusa (Natalia Vodianova).

He's not entirely alone, but the soldiers he took with him all seem to be pretty expendable. He has a guardian goddess, Io (Gemma Arterton), and a magical sword from Zeus that he refuses to use until the last minute, and the invaluable aid of Pegasus. Oddly, in this version Pegasus is the only black winged horse in the herd; I'm used to his being white.

It's rousing thrill-a-minute adventure, not too gory for the older kids, and refreshingly realistic compared to the stop-action techniques of Harryhausen. There are several extra characters, one whole group of which I won't tell you about because their appearance on the scene is a surprise, as is their role in the story. If you love mythology, you'll love this movie.",1336694400,,1857,4.808777429467084

The only reason I gave this a one star was because as soon as my mom and realized how bad it was, I started to make up alternative dialogue for the scenes, and we laughed our way through the whole movie.

I'm not a kid anymore. While original childhood favorites hold a special place in my heart like Flash Gordon for example, I'm not blinded by the fact that they get dated by modern standards. To say the original is better than this would be like saying the original King Kong was better than Peter Jackson's. Seriously? I think not. Clash should have been longer but people complain about 'long' movies too. When 2 1/2 hours is 'long' to people, that's pretty amazing. You get a more thorough story and movie. I don't think many know what they want at all. I'll watch this again. I have no real gripes here.",1334016000,,909,4.352941176470588
4029348,3,B002ZG9788,"It's difficult to know where to start when defending a film that's been almost universally excoriated. Perhaps the beginning is the best place.

For me, the beginning was watching Ray Harryhausen's films as a kid. I saw many in first-run. ""Earth vs. the Flying Saucers"" at the age of 9 was the first.

The last was ""Clash of the Titans"", released at the same time as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". I saw both on the same night in DC, and it was obvious Ray had gone out with a whimper, rather than a bang. ""Raiders"" handily eclipsed it.

The problem with Ray Harryhausen's films was that his stop-motion sequences were /always/ the best things in them. No major studio understood how Harryhausen's effects could ""plus"" films that already had good scripts, acting, and direction. Only Charles Schneer at Columbia saw the potential of Harryhausen's work, but he could never get the money needed to realize that potential. *

Harryhausen's films are a mixed bag of mediocrity. Some of them have good scripts (notably Beverley Cross's for ""Jason"" and ""Titans""), but the direction varies from competent to poor. (Desmond Davis's helming of ""Titans"" is notably snooze-inducing.) The acting is similarly variable; no one should be obliged to watch Kerwin Matthews in /anything/. (It's hard to believe that Danny Kaye, who'd already made fantasy films, turned down ""Gulliver"". **) The films /surrounding/ Harryhausen's effects only occasionally approached the imagination and sheer stylishness of those effects. ***

On the (very!) plus side, four of those films have Bernard Herrmann scores, ""Sinbad"" and ""Gulliver"" being of especially high quality. (Note the praise of ""Sinbad""'s score in the Wikipedia article.) And ""Titans"" has romantic, genuinely thrilling music by Laurence Rosenthal.

""Titans"" is, to paraphrase King Arthur, ""a rather silly film"" (though it needn't have been). It went on to become a ""kamp klassik"", and there was a time when TBS ran it once a month.

The producers (and director) of the remake were mostly people who'd seen the original as kids, and had genuine affection for it. So why is it such a bad film?

Well... IT ISN'T. The Wikipedia article reveals an ambitious plan to create a mash-up of mythologies from multiple cultures. However clever this was, it would have thoroughly confused audiences. So the remake is principally a rethinking of the original.

The original stuck closely to the original myth of Perseus and the Gorgon. Its changes were primarily additions to pad the story. The remake veers widely from the myth, in particular having Perseus found and raised by a fisherman, with his mother Dana dying.

The remake's most-important change is the introduction -- as the central dramatic conflict -- of the conceit that the pagan gods continued their existence only because humans loved and worshipped them. This isn't new; it appears in ""Excalibur"", ""Dragonslayer"" (Why is there no Blu-ray of this film, with its wonderful Oscar-nominated Alex North score?), and likely other films. Though a demi-god, Perseus opposes the old order, and wants the gods to butt out of human affairs.

The script -- which borrows much from Beverley Cross's original -- is terse and generally free of Dumb Stuff (though the brief appearance of a character from the original, which draws a huge laugh, should have been deleted). The acting is acceptable, with Neeson and Fiennes sensibly underplaying.

The problem is the direction. Though the remake moves along crisply, without feeling rushed, Louis Leterrier -- as too many other directors -- has little understanding of how to adjust the pace of a film. He moves flatly from scene to scene, without building tension -- then releasing and rebuilding it. I advise him to listen to the first act of ""Die Walk&uuml;re"", a perfect example of how this is done musically.

Ray Harryhausen's animation reflects this belief in the ""slow build"". Perseus's confrontation with Medusa (a superb piece of stop-motion animation, the only genuinely good thing in the original) takes its time getting started. It's a cat-and-mouse game that ratchets up the tension. The remake is almost all continuous action, without any rise/fall or give-and-take. This is particularly disappointing, as CGI lets the animators do almost anything they like, without the restrictions of manipulating physical models. This sequence would have been much better had it copied the /style/ of the original.

Perhaps the oddest difference between the original and remake is female nudity -- the PG original had it, the PG-13 remake doesn't! In the original, we see a naked Dana suckling Perseus, and both she and Andromeda are shown ""butt""-nekkid.

""Clash of the Titans"" is not a bad film. Like its precursor, it's silly fun, and can be enjoyed on that level.

* It's decidedly ironic that Tinseltown -- the world's leading purveyor of fantasy -- never saw the potential of fantasy films, largely relegating them to B movies and programmers. ""The Wizard of Oz"" was supposedly framed as a dream, on the assumption audiences wouldn't accept it as ""reality"". Yet in ""Dark Victory"", Bette Davis dies quickly and painlessly of an unspecified brain disorder. I find that considerably more ""fantastic"" than the land of Oz.

** ""The Three Worlds of Gulliver"" is the best adaptation of the novel I've seen (the Robert Halmi TV version included), because it doesn't ignore the satire at the center of the story.

*** This is perhaps overstating the case, as even ""mediocre"" films can have their own styles, and be entertaining. But Ray Harryhausen's outstanding work repeatedly throws into relief the overall weakness of his films. You keep thinking ""If only the acting and directing had been better...""",1333584000,2,5720,5.099465240641711
4029349,1,B002ZG9788,"""Clash of the Titans"" is a truly amazing film -- never before have I seen a movie that is so BUSY, and yet so staggeringly DULL.

This stupid movie was apparently made to cash in on the wild success of 300, but it pretty much missed everything that made that movie enjoyable. Instead, this remake of the classic cult film is full of everything and nothing -- Louis Leterrier crams it with horrible acting, endless CGI, and an obnoxiously preachy plot that ends up being brain-bleedingly boring.

A fisherman finds a floating coffin, which holds a dead princess and a still-living baby. He adopts the child, Perseus (Sam Worthington), and raises him as well -- until the god Hades (Ralph Fiennes) destroys Perseus' family and fishing boat. He's marched to the city of Argos, where he sees the king and queen declare war on the gods...

... only to have Hades proclaim that if Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is not sacrificed within ten days, the kraken will destroy Argos. A mysterious woman named Io (Gemma Arterton) tells Perseus that he is actually the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), and is the only hope of slaying the kraken and saving Argos.

Honestly, the story of Perseus is one of the awesomest, most movieworthy stories in Greek mythology -- you've got a demigod hero, a sea monster, a flying horse, and a snake-headed creature that turns people to stone. But apparently, THAT story isn't good enough for the people in Hollywood. They even mock the original movie in one scene involving the mechanical owl Bubo.

Instead director Leterrier crams all sorts of weird random stuff into the movie -- it's a constant onslaught of giant scorpions, CGI monsters, djinni, and witches who look like Guillermo del Toro discards. The plot feels skeletal and bloated at the same time, with horribly silly dialogue (""It is death who should be afraid of us!"") and dozeworthy action scenes.

Even worse, the screenwriters seem hell-bent on pushing their own theological philosophy on us (""God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him"") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of ""We hate the gods! Gods are awful! Let's stupidly anger them even though they're incredibly powerful!""... only for them to undermine their own message in the last reel.

And really, how can you go wrong when you have Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in your movie, playing GODS? Well, you can cast the bland lump that is Sam Worthington as your lead, a pouting prettyboy who brings no charisma to his role, giving Neeson nothing to do except throw divine tantrums and Fiennes nothing to do except slink around being vaguely sinister (since a god of death HAS to be evil, right? WRONG!). As for Gemma Arterton, she just sort of wanders in and out of the story, serving as a source of convenient information.

""Clash of the Titans"" would be better titled ""Flush of the Titans"" -- a reeking lump of brainless cinema that stupefies even as it preaches. The original is flawed, but infinitely superior to this one.",1333497600,2,2983,4.8125

4029504,3,B002ZG9788,"Being a god used to come with a certain amount of clout, but now the human race Zeus (Liam Neeson) created with such love has turned against him. They are no longer interested in believing in him, in bowing to his commands, or in sending up the prayers he requires in order to remain strong. His retaliation against one mortal king that stands against him results in the birth of a child, who is set adrift on the high seas and adopted by an unsuspecting fisherman and his wife. Perseus (Sam Worthington) grows up with no knowledge of his parentage or the circumstances surrounding his existence. He lives in a world fraught with peril as mortals and gods engage in massive combat. And there is nothing he can do but watch in horror as Hades (Ralph Fiennes), god of the underworld, murders his family in one of his rampages in retaliation for the continued defiance of the people of Argos.

As punishment for their arrogance, Hades threatens to unleash the mighty Kraken on Athos during the next eclipse, and warns them that there is only one way they can obtain salvation from the beast -- a human sacrifice in the form of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). Perseus wants nothing to do with it until a mysterious immortal named Io (Gemma Arterton) reveals to him that he is a demigod, the illegitimate son of Zeus and only he can defeat the Kraken. But first he must journey to the far corners of the world, consult the witches on how to bring it about, pass through the underworld, and do battle with Medusa -- before the eclipse unleashes the wrath of the heavens. When Zeus learns of his existence, he desires to give his son the tools required to carry out his mission, but Perseus desires to have nothing to do with the governing forces that have brought about so much unhappiness -- and his resistance to accepting his destiny might bring about his defeat.

One of the first things audiences should know heading into this blockbuster is that it is nothing like the original mythology, something that might disappoint scholars and fans of Greek literature. It is actually a more modern take on a popular movie from many years ago and as such carries the same faults, with a few new ones. I went with my brother, who is a student of mythology, and he was disappointed that so many changes were made to the legends, and that Poseidon is entirely absent, apart from one line of dialogue and limited screen time. I understand their reasons for limiting his presence in terms of budget and keeping the focus on his brothers, but at the same time I would have liked to have seen the god of the seas in action. That point aside, I enjoyed it. There are times when the battle sequences feel a little drawn-out but the magnificent computer effects and exquisite creatures and panoramas more than make up for it. It has an enormous budget and makes the most of it, casting some terrific talent while at the same time not skimping on first-class special effects. Medusa and her head of snakes, the Kraken, the winged horse Pegasus, gnarled and truly hideous witches -- this movie has it all and then some. True, it is a film that wants to carry its audience from one fight to another and so there is not much down time (and as such, not a huge amount of character development) but I expected nothing less.

But those creatures that Ray brought to life were truly ""memorable characters"" that will always live on in our minds.

But the Hollywood suits like to rake in some extra dough by doing remakes of classic films knowing that the fans of the originals will be guarunteed curious suckers, and sure enough... this one was absolute CRAP!!! First off, these new CGI monsters (with the exception of the ""Black Pegasus"") were no better than what I've seen in a Playstation video game. The script and storyboard sucked hard. I mean real hard. When they weren't stealing the most memorable lines from the original and delivering them so bad that it made your stomach turn, it was just vomitable adventure movie clap-trap. Not a single clever line or anything that would put a smile on your face. There were also some lines that sounded more like ""modern speak"". Not at all period correct.

4029622,5,B002ZG9788,"""Clash of the Titans"" is an exciting and entertaining sword and toga style adventure that is based around Greek mythology stories with familiar characters such as the gods (Zeus, Hades, etc) and creatures such as the Medusa and the Kraken. This particular tale centers around Perseus (who we find out early on is the illegitimate son of Zeus; therefore making him a demigod or half god, half man). Perseus is content to live his life as a fisherman and is ignorant to how unordinary he actually is. Of course, a life as an anonymous fisherman is not in the cards for Perseus who soon finds himself in the middle of a war between the gods and the people of Argos who have chosen to defy the gods and go their own way. What follows is an action packed adventure that finds Perseus and a ragtag group of soldiers going up against giant scorpions, Medusa, and other equally nasty creatures in a quest to save Argos from total annihilation.

I thought the overall story was very entertaining. I have always enjoyed Greek mythology and was familiar with all the gods and people that inhabit the story. I thought the overwhelming odds that Perseus and his soldier companions had to face was effectively daunting. The viewer can easily see how overmatched a mortal is against creatures created by the gods and how invincible a god is (a person is like an insignificant fly to a god and just as easily crushed). The film also portrays Perseus' abilities well as a demigod (although he has no military training he is naturally skilled and stronger than a mortal). I also like how the gods were portrayed in this film. I was always of the opinion that the gods were selfish, pompous and arrogant and treated mortals as their personal playthings especially Zeus. Liam Neeson's portrayal of Zeus is dead on with the vision I have of him. Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Hades is also very good. I always thought Hades got a raw deal especially with all he did to defeat the titans; Fiennes depicts Hades' jealousy and rage mixed with cleverness and cunning very well.

Sam Worthington was convincing as Perseus (I believed his mixture of being naive to the world but skilled as a demigod). Gemma Arterton as Io was also very good as Perseus' protector, guide, and love interest (I really like her voice as well; I like listening to her talk!). I think the standout character and performance lies with Mads Mikkelson's Draco, commander of the soldiers. I always think that the real heroes of these types of stories are the secondary characters that brave the danger with no advantages. Draco is a skilled fighter and does an incredible job of dealing with the overwhelming odds set against them by the gods; for a mortal that's pretty admirable. Mads Mikkelson really makes this movie in my opinion.

The Blu-ray looks and sounds excellent and helps further the epic nature of the film. I have the non-3D version of this movie. I have not seen the 3D version, therefore, I cannot comment on the quality of that version of the film (not a huge fan of 3D on these types of movies). The special features were ok (nothing special, just standard stuff).

Now, I like Leterrier.  And there's really no reason to believe that he would struggle with a remake such as this.  But, then again, I also wasn't under the impression that he would get caught up in the challenges laid down by previous superlative blockbusters.  Sometimes you just need to consider the source material you're working with and succumb to the innocent mindlessness of it all.

Well, here we are.  And forgive me if I sound naive, but the strongest gripe I have with this modern re-imagining of the 80's cult classic is its inability to know its place in the tier pyramid of summer blockbusters.  Ask yourself if you want drama in your greek mythology.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  Now, ask yourself the last time the two were successfully coupled since the days of Homer.

I never wanted drama with my Titans.  It ranks alongside cyborgs as the one thing that, I believe, can and should be devoid of sincere drama in order to attain its highest potential lest you steal screen-time from the very necessary beast slaying.

Well, there lies the profound issue with Leterrier's priorities.  You'd be hard-pressed to find anything truly satisfying with this film, given what it promises. It's a devoutly crafted salute to an unlikely cult classic, but there's truly nothing compelling about...well, anything.  It's disappointing, considering the infinite scope of the source material.  I'm a sucker for Greek lore.

There does seem to be something very incomplete about what is shown here.  A sequel - or, dare I say, a trilogy - is almost guaranteed.  I can't deny that I'm willing to give Leterrier and crew a second chance, given what's available.  But until then...you've got a long way to go, baby.

Worthington gives the most uninspired performance I've yet seen by him, and just about everyone else seems to follow suit.  Again, I must reiterate how transparent the supposed drama here really is.  No real standouts exist, here.  It goes a long way towards making every scene a potential bore.

So, again I say, here we are.  Left with the scattered bones of a sad concept looking for a future.  Will it find just that in the sequels?  I'd like to think so.  But, until then, most may want to save themselves the time and money; go read the Odyssey.",1324166400,2,2418,4.729016786570743

Now for the story...Great potential that falls short.  The lead actors and actresses do a great job with the script that was given.  From Liam Neeson(Zeus) to Sam Worthington (Perseus) whois helpless to save his family from Hades (Ralph Fiennes), god of the underworld to Gemma Arterton (IO) the woman who watches, not a complaint on the acting.

I noticed the actor Pete Postlethwaite looks like he's plays Perseus's father. He puts in a good performance that grounds the movie.

4029727,4,B002ZG9788,"I chose this movie as a pay per view choice on Direct TV. I wasn't expecting very much. After all remakes can really be bad e.g War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise comes to mind.  However , I realized that this remake was going to be surprisingly different right from the beginning.

  In the beginning of the movie there is a scene where the king and queen are holding court and really running off at the mouth, saying some pretty nasty things about the gods. However, they soon realize they have an uninvited guest. Hades materializes and soon begins to spoil the party. Hades is there to make an ultimatum , they will have to make some serious decisions. Hades ,a god, approaches the queen and commands her, ""Kneel,mortal queen!""

My God ,I would purchase this DVD for that scene alone. Let's face it . Ralph Fiennes is the dark Lord. Whether his name is Voldemort or Hades; he sure knows how to be dark. Ralph Fiennes was an excellent choice for Hades as was Liam Neeson for Zeus. While Sam Worthington gets the lead billing as Perseus ,there are excellent actors in the supporting roles that really make this movie worth your time and money.

When I read the 1 star reviews I couldn't believe that anyone would prefer the original over this remake. While the original may have been entertaining ,the remake is totally superior. The director sort of pokes a little fun at the original version. In a scene where Perseus is searching for weapons and supplies for the upcoming journey they are embarking upon and he reaches into a bin of materials pulls out the mechanical owl prop used in the original and asks a soldier "" Whats this?""  and receives the simple response  ""Leave it "".  I chuckled to myself during that scene because I realized that the director thought that the mechanical owl was a ridiculous prop too. That owl didn't really work as good as it was intended; and in the remake they had the good sense to leave it out.

I am not sure what the 1 star critics are seeing when they watch this movie,but it is obvious that we do not see the same thing.",1321142400,2,2064,4.465425531914893

When ZEUS stuck HADES with his thunderbolt through PERSEUS' sword,(everyone who has seen it knows what I'm talking about) all I could say was WOW!

I saw the original 1981 ""CLASH"" as a kid,and many times since, and I do enjoy that one also, and have it also on dvd and I even still have the vhs copy. However this remake is like a roaring lion, compared to the 1981 ""CLASH"" which would be in comparison like a house cat. And those  that say the acting or script was no good or no character developement,I was really into the characters. PERSEUS was heroic,IO was beautiful, ZEUS was commanding and the KRAKEN made the harryhausen kraken seem like an old leggo toy figure.

4030048,3,B002ZG9788,"***1/2

The original version of ""Clash of the Titans"" was an infinitely entertaining - and still fondly remembered - piece of early `80s kitsch comprised of one part corn to two parts cheese.  It was further distinguished by having a number of acting legends of both stage and screen (i.e., Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith) slumming their way through the project - and obviously having the time of their professional lives doing so.

The 2010 version, directed by Louis Leterrier, trades in star power and campiness for improved special effects and a more straightforward action-movie approach to the material (though Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes do appear as Zeus and Hades, respectively).

Sam Worthington stars as Persius, the demi-god son of Zeus, who leads the humans in a war against the gods, whom he blames for the deaths of his adoptive parents and little sister.  Persius also must face-down and defeat the mighty Kracken, a terrifying, indestructible beast that serves as the gods' ultimate weapon against the people.

It's all very Saturday-matinee juvenilia in spirit and tone, but the pacing is swift, the special effects impressive, and the various and sundry monsters and creatures sufficiently imaginative and larger-than-life to make us suspend our disbelief, if only for the duration.

4030049,1,B002ZG9788,"It wasn't a surprise this movie was bad, it was surprising just how bad it could be.  The script seemed like it was written by a 13 year old, and the direction is ridiculous.  To say it's stupid is such an understatement.  How does a wooden boat sink?  How does a sword stick into a marble column?  How does a knife sever a 2 foot thick stalactite?  They turned a hero into a grumpy juice-head, they threw in a gratuitous ""strong female character,"" and the so called story is the minimum amount of dialog to string together over the top, silly fight scenes.

Supporting actors did a good job acting their parts, but when your part is written like crap, directed like crap, and edited to be a steamy pile of crap it doesn't help that they have strong supporting actors (many of which have about three lines).

Don't watch this movie.  All it will do is upset and disappoint you.",1309564800,6,877,4.39751552795031
4030050,3,B002ZG9788,"to be fair this movie is almost impossible to make in any way that won't strain your willing suspension of disbelief. so, let's get the absurdity of the movie's basic premise out of the way. the gods, the old ones, not the more spiritual new ones who know better, need mankind's belief and love in order to exist. okay, not that original, but an interesting idea except that there is no need for any kind of faith when these gods walk around visibly and destructively among us. even goldman sachs manages to stay somewhat hidden as it wields power and wreaks havoc. not so these gods, especially their pet kraken. there might have been a more workable storyline built on whether these gods deserved our trust. but no matter. these gods are just men with way too much power. and it's never quite clear just how much power the demigods, like perseus and io, have. more in the range of superstar athletes, i guess. but to enjoy the movie, which you can, you need to shove all this behind you. like satanic conspiracy movies like ""damien"" where you have to forget that there is also an all-mighty and righteous god logically somewhere in the background.

 still, there is a lot to like about the movie. perseus is honorable and cool. andromeda is wonderful, both beautiful and compassionate, and seemingly to good to refuse on any grounds. the medusa is also beautiful, and deadly, with that great hairdo of tiny serpents. the giant scorpion creatures are also deadly and a nice setup for the later real-time monster in the kraken. on the good-guy side the pegasus is quite well done and its flight/fight abilities very effective.

 the love story is so minimal you wonder why they bothered, and there is no real chemistry between perseus and io, which is nearly canceled by both the beauty and magnetism of andromeda. you'd think someone would figure out that even in these costume-epics they don't have to reduce women to cardboard cutouts.

 with plenty of flaws that might distract you, i say forget all that and enjoy the action and the good things that the movie offers, and forget the embarrassing absurdity of the gods, their pretentious mannered dialog and even more pretentious costuming. why does zeus need armor, anyway?",1308700800,3,2228,4.759067357512953
4030051,2,B002ZG9788,"When I saw that one of the lead actors from the movie ""Avatar"" was also starring in this movie, I thought ""Clash of the Titans"" would be a sure thing. But when I finally did get to see the film, I was left disappointed.

I thought the special effects were well-done, and since this movie was made in 2010 and such things are done with computers this ought to be expected. But I also think the special effects were OVER done, because the movie relies so much on visual wow factors and less on acting and story development.

Maybe it's just me, but I had a bit of trouble following the plot of this movie. I watched the 1980s Harry Hamlin version when a friend loaned it to me on VHS, and even though the older film is cheesy in places, with lots of dated claymation, it tells a better story, and the acting is better!

Since I watched the older movie first it was a little easier to understand the newer one because basically it's the same thing, but I think that if I didn't see the older movie first and just watched the new one by itself, I'd be very confused about what exactly was the point of the whole thing.

All in all this movie reminds me of a really, really bad, bombastic Michael Bay movie with lots of visuals but without much else. It's a shame because it seems like the cast could do better. I'm certainly glad I didn't waste money seeing this in a theater but I'm disappointed I watched the movie, because it's 100plus minutes of my life I can't get back, which I could have better spent sleeping. I'll bet I could dream something more entertaining than this mess!

I did give this a second star because I think Sam Worthington is cute, but other than him being eye candy, that's the film's problem. It's just eye candy, with not much else to offer.",1308009600,3,1765,4.304216867469879
4030052,4,B002ZG9788,"I love adaptations of the classics in general, even when unfaithful to the original, so I'm bound to be a bit biased.  I thought the movie Troy was spectacular.  I enjoy popcorn flicks, and hardly even notice gaping plot holes (what does this say of me?), so you may wish to cast salt after my judgment. I'd heard this movie was tossed in with post-New-Year's cinema dregs, so perhaps I had low expectations.  Whatever my excuse, I thought this movie was great.

The Good: The special effects.  I saw this movie on DVD without any invasion into more than two dimensions, and perhaps that saved it.  The monsters were convincing - horrific when they needed to be, creepy when they needed to be, and stupendous when they needed to be.  Pegasus was especially convincing, I thought, and the witches were particular creepy, even if they did escape the end of the first Halo game.  The CGI was perhaps obvious, but who cares if it serves the story well?  The action.  After Troy I could see them trying to give Perseus some special martial arts effects, but there were no affectations here.  Missing was implausible escalation (where every baddie must be just a bit more dangerous than the last, even if the baddie thrown up on the screen happens to be an accountant or crazy priest).  Missing was horror-show gore, even when they had opportunity.  A lot of great actors were thrown into this movie, too, and while they may not have turned in Oscar-caliber performances, they lent weight to the movie - they gave their roles significance.  I really liked seeing Le Chiffre pop up in this movie, and his end was classy.

The Bad: Sam Worthington, godluvim, makes a great apple pie and ice cream American boy (I realize he's not American), but he doesn't quite carry ""Bronze Age Hero.""  Especially when the actors around him are all wearing Mycenaean beards and eyeliner, they could have done something to Greek him up a bit.  Still, it wasn't a pain to watch him in the movie or anything.  The Kraken made up 90 percent of the commercials, as I recall, which is a shame, since its thunder was stolen from the film when it really needed it.  The marketing folks should have taken a page from JJ Abrams' Cloverfield.

Honestly, it wouldn't have been my first choice of 3D movies, but when we bought it, there were only a handful of movies available in 3D, which were mostly documentaries, and of course we had to buy a few movies to properly try out our new toy. So mostly due to lack of other options, we purchased this one.

I am very pleased to say that what I expected to be a movie filled with too much action (I expected mostly fighting and effects with no real plot) was actually fantastic! It's now one of my favorites, especially as I now have it synced onto my iPod and iPad (thank you digital copy!), so I can watch it any time or place I'd like.

The 3D is incredible! The picture and sound are very realistic (on every version of the movie, even DVD).  I was very impressed.
However, if you are expecting an ""old time"" movie theatre 3D, you will not find that here.  The 3D in this movie is not where the images jump off the screen and into your face to scare you (which is probably good, because it would definitely distract from the rest of the movie).  You will not be waiting for something to reach out and grab you, so if that's what you're looking for, you'd be better finding a movie like Despicable Me.  Instead, the 3D is used to improve the quality of the visuals, making you feel as though you are in the room with the characters.  It is very realistic.

4030101,3,B002ZG9788,"CLASH OF THE TITANS was perhaps more entertaining as a 3D movie in theaters than it is on the small screen of the home television where the CGI effects are less impressive and at times downright silly. Louis Leterrier directed this remake of the 1981 Olivier/Hamlin epic based on Beverley Cross's take on the struggle for power between the Greek Gods and mankind: this time around the myth is manipulated by Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, and Matt Manfredi who have managed to create dialogue that must have been embarrassing for the actors to speak.  The gods are either surrounded by blinding light or smog-on-a-bad-day smoke and the presence of the creatures of the very mixed up version of the myth range form beautiful Pegasus (flying horses) to a voluptuous Medusa to the bigger than life scorpions and devilish gods to the Kraken who probably wins the contest for most disgusting beastie - though the competition is tough!

The story is basically an attempt of Zeus and the gods on Olympus to restore their tainted reputation as being adored and worshiped through the wiles of Perseus who is thwarted by a long standing sibling rivalry victim Hades in Perseus' travels to kill the Medusa and the supposedly indestructible Kraken. It is a tale of men versus kings versus gods versus good and evil.  The very odd aspect of this dark film is the fact that of many of the cast are among the finest actors on the screen. Some are minor actors (Sam Worthington plays Sam Worthington who is placed complete with burr cut in the role of Perseus), but others include Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Hans Matheson, Danny Huston,  Nicholas Hoult, the departed Pete Postlethwaite, Mads Mikkelsen (the strongest in the cast), a very chubby Polly Walker, Elizabeth McGovern, Gemma Arterton - the list goes on and on.

Having never seen the original 1981 Clash of the Titans makes comparison impossible, but if the purpose for making this over the edge movie was to test contemporary 3D techniques it probably succeeds. As for the acting and the script - this film is merely a chuckle.  Grady Harp, April 11",1302998400,,2090,4.807799442896936

Apart from the obvious flaws you notice immediately into the film, the most disappointing is that this movie takes away all the charm the original Clash of the Titans had.  A perfect example is Bubo, the mechanical owl who helps Perseus in the first film.  He served as a R2D2 type character providing comic relief as well as being a guide for the hero.  In this movie, Perseus notices Bubo on a pile of junk and picks him up and asks ""What is this?"". In response, he is told to ""leave THAT behind"".

4030104,4,B002ZG9788,"At the risk of not so much swimming against the tide as against a tidal wave, I thought the much-despised 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans was a terrific entertainment that managed to improve on many aspects of the now much-loved but itself initially disparaged Ray Harryhausen version. For a start it's barely a remake, sharing only the title and the subject matter, discarding the love story and family-friendly elements for an altogether grittier and bleaker view that's at least more true to the cruelty of Greek mythology even if the details aren't so well served.

If Sam Worthington's Perseus is a throwback to the typical beefcake hero of 50s peplum, the script at least is smarter than the average mythological adventure. Instead of than fulfilling a divine destiny, this version's demi-god Perseus - half man, half-god, all-Ocker - is raging against it, determined to defy the gods as a man. These gods are cruel and parasitic, dependent on the worship of men to fuel their immortality but unwilling to earn it, their arrogance sparking a war with the mortals who don't want them any more. Rather than taking a Richard Dawkins ""there is no god"" approach, this is more of a ""the gods exist and they're a right bunch of bastards"" attack, with the dawning realisation that they can ultimately kill them by denying them their prayers. The film does copout on this with the end used in the film, the Blu-ray offering an alternate but poorly executed original version that saw Liam Neeson's Zeus and Perseus still very much at loggerheads, and by losing the love story between Perseus and Andromeda it does lower the stakes somewhat. Perseus' quest is now fuelled by pride, arrogance and defiance, with an impressively bitter Mads Mikkelsen and his high-testosterone expendable Argonauts all manly men meeting manly deaths at the hands and claws and tentacles of mythological beasts.

The beasts themselves are generally a pretty impressive bunch, the CGi faring much better in the original 2D than in the clumsily converted 3D version released in cinemas. If Ralph Fiennes' Hades is better as a special effect than when overdoing the Uriah Heap routine in more human form, the impressively rendered giant scorpions, multi-tentacled Kraken and the serpent-like Medusa grab the limelight over some of the old favorites from the Harryhausen version: Jason Flemyng's Calibos has less to do this time round while Pegasus simply conveniently appears when needed without needing to be tamed in a rather lazy bit of deux ex machina. But then this is the kind of film where the human cast are mostly sidelined as well, actors like Pete Posthlethwaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Danny Huston and Polly Walker turning up for a minute or two as little more than walk-ons and most of the gods having nothing more to do than stand around a disappointingly designed Olympus whose exteriors are spectacular but whose interiors look like Las Vegas car showroom. But it keeps moving without feeling too chopped up and thankfully there's a minimum of shakeycam or MTV overediting to accompany the overdose of testosterone. Big on spectacle and short on charm, it's a very different animal to Harryhausen's film (there's even an injoke about that version's irritating mechanical owl), but as long as you're expecting that it's one of the better action adventures of recent years.

DVD buyers get short shrift yet again, with nearly all of the extras reserved for the BluRay release - 10 deleted scenes and alternate ending, 11 featurettes and additional picture-in-picture featurettes running throughout the film if you choose `Maximum Movie Mode' - which has a generally excellent transfer.",1301270400,,3672,5.0561056105610565

This is the opening quote from the Amazon.com review and description of this Hi-Tech Turkey.  All the computer generated effects cannot make this film, and most of the other modern technological ""masterpieces"" of the past decade, worth watching.  I feel as if I'm watching a video game with additional, irrelevant dialogue when I view movies these days.  The script, the acting, and yes, the special effects in this new 2010 ""Clash"" are ridiculous.  Ray Harryhausen was a genius and his classic films, though definitely dated, still hold up well as much as seventy years later. I don't think that anyone will say the same about ""Clash 2010"",the Transformer movies,or their ilk ten years from now. I agree that the original 1981 Harry Hamlin film was a bit cornball, but it is ""Gone with the Wind"" compaired to this state-of-the-art mess!

4030188,4,B002ZG9788,"Since I like the original film more, I'll not suffer to make any comparisons (as this wasn't a very faithful adaption in any regard, the matter is moot).  I'll just say that I also liked this ""same titled movie"" and leave it at that.  Besides, any movie with Pete Postlethwaite in it already has a lot going for it.  The man was stellar.
What is impressive about this new version is its darker, grubby/grimy look.  It wasn't as pristine as most costume action flicks.  It was also populated by a surly lot (gods and mortals alike, everyone seemed miffed about something), for some reason I found that amusing.  Plus, there were those great monsters, a snakier Medusa, and of course the Kraken.  Loved the star field opening sequence (which I assume was spectacular in 3D).  Since I never saw the 3D version of this film, that isn't an issue for me, I took this film as it was presented: not great, but good enough.  I was entertained.  (I'm very basic that way.)
If I have a complaint, it's slight: the owl.  As that owl played a major role in the original film, but was only a brief toss-off in this one, I'm left wondering why it was included: homage or for mocking purposes?  Then too, there was Sam Worthington's (ahem) acting.  I know he spent a great deal of print space bragging how much better this version was then the old film and that he most certainly did NOT want to work with THAT owl...  Those considerations aside, Sam was the only character/actor I couldn't vividly recall after viewing the movie.  He scowled a lot, I remember that, but he lacked presence.  So it's a little disappointing to learn he'll reprise Perseus for the sequel (and possible third film?).  Hopefully by then he'll have realized that even a little personality goes a long way.
I will be keeping this film for my collection, but it will NOT go on the same shelf as the original!  No point in adding insult to injury.",1299542400,,1906,4.523391812865497

""Clash of the Titans"" not realistic when it comes to historical accuracy, but then again most movies based on greek, roman or any other mytholgies never are. This is a remake of the campy but cool 1981 version, and this one features way better special effects and acting and storytelling as bland and predictable as it comes. Sam Worthington (Terminator 4) stars as Perseus son of Zeus who is raised by a fishing family that is killed when Zeus statue is destroyed by an army defying the gods. Perseus is discovered by soldiers of Argos and after discovering he is Zeus' son is asked to take the task of defeating Hades and killing a creature known as ""The Kraken"". What follows is a series of battle scenes with various monsters that while impressive really don't have any reason to them, they just happen.

Zeus (Liam Neeson, ""Taken"") wants his son to take his place as one of them, while Hades (Ralph Finnes ""Red Dragon"") wishes for the destruction of all man and wants to become the leader of the gods after being cast out by Zeus some time ago. There's also some race called the Djinn, which are neat looking conjourers that live in the desert that really are about the only cool characters in the whole movie.

You get it all in this movie, giant scorpions, bad acting, a battle with Medusa, bad dialogue, the Kraken, and stale characters. Its a quick film, maybe 95 mins before the end credits start, but unfortunately all the thought and effort seemed to be put into the special effects. Again the acting, writing, stale characters really bring it down.",1297641600,3,1589,4.667857142857143

4030195,1,B002ZG9788,"""Clash of the Titans"" is a truly amazing film -- never before have I seen a movie that is so BUSY, and yet so staggeringly DULL.

This stupid movie was apparently made to cash in on the wild success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/300/dp/B000QXDED6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">300</a>, but it pretty much missed everything that made that movie enjoyable. Instead, this remake of the classic cult film is full of everything and nothing -- Louis Leterrier crams it with horrible acting, endless CGI, and an obnoxiously preachy plot that ends up being brain-bleedingly boring.

A fisherman finds a floating coffin, which holds a dead princess and a still-living baby. He adopts the child, Perseus (Sam Worthington), and raises him as well -- until the god Hades (Ralph Fiennes) destroys Perseus' family and fishing boat. He's marched to the city of Argos, where he sees the king and queen declare war on the gods...

... only to have Hades proclaim that if Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is not sacrificed within ten days, the kraken will destroy Argos. A mysterious woman named Io  (Gemma Arterton) tells Perseus that he is actually the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), and is the only hope of slaying the kraken and saving Argos.

Honestly, the story of Perseus is one of the awesomest, most movieworthy stories in Greek mythology -- you've got a demigod hero, a sea monster, a flying horse, and a snake-headed creature that turns people to stone. But apparently, THAT story isn't good enough for the people in Hollywood. They even mock the original movie in one scene involving the mechanical owl Bubo.

Instead director Leterrier crams all sorts of weird random stuff into the movie -- it's a constant onslaught of giant scorpions, CGI monsters, djinni, and witches who look like Guillermo del Toro discards. The plot feels skeletal and bloated at the same time, with horribly silly dialogue (""It is death who should be afraid of us!"") and dozeworthy action scenes.

Even worse, the screenwriters seem hell-bent on pushing their own theological philosophy on us (""God sucks and ruins everything, so don't worship him"") NON-STOP. There's scene after scene of ""We hate the gods! Gods are awful! Let's stupidly anger them even though they're incredibly powerful!""... only for them to undermine their own message in the last reel.

And really, how can you go wrong when you have Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes in your movie, playing GODS? Well, you can cast the bland lump that is Sam Worthington as your lead, a pouting prettyboy who brings no charisma to his role, giving Neeson nothing to do except throw divine tantrums and Fiennes nothing to do except slink around being vaguely sinister (since a god of death HAS to be evil, right? WRONG!). As for Gemma Arterton, she just sort of wanders in and out of the story, serving as a source of convenient information.

""Clash of the Titans"" would be better titled ""Flush of the Titans"" -- a reeking lump of brainless cinema that stupefies even as it preaches. The original is flawed, but infinitely superior to this one.",1296518400,5,3108,5.031128404669261

I don't know how many of the Greek myths have been brought to the screen, but anyone familiar with the ""Jim Henson's The Storyteller: Greek Myths"" ought to appreciate this movie.  Indeed, anyone who appreciates the genius of Greek myth ought to appreciate this movie.

Maybe because I knew nothing about this movie (other than the fact that the likeable Sam Worthington was in it) and just happened to see it on HBO disqalifies me as a bona fide commentator.

On the other hand, I had no prior expectations, no bias, no reason to compare it to anything else, especially the work of Ray Harryhausen. I have, therefore, no reason to gripe.  This is cgi fantasy entertainment based on the myth of the first Greek hero/demigod, Perseus.

This new movie is about arrogant jerks overflowing with undeserved and overabundant pride in themselves. The story itself was choppy and only redid a lot of scenes from the first with better special effects, but without actually tying them together well. In the first, it was clear why the heroes traveled to each place and had each encounter. In this version, the only reason seemed to be the fact that there was a similar scene in the original.

The overall message seems appropriate for the times, however. A bunch of pride filled people thinking they are so great, but having no accomplishments to back up that belief, and deciding they will openly rebel against ""the gods"", because people don't need the gods. Of course, then it also shows (unwittingly perhaps) that, no matter what man can do for himself in life (and they certainly weren't doing much for each other in this movie), after death, their fate is still in the hands of the gods they've rejected, as seen in Calibos's fate.",1294099200,3,1404,4.745901639344262

Yes there are inconsistencies, but if you pick apart every production piece by piece you can't enjoy it for what it is, after all this is entertainment. If you want a Greek Mythology reference for a university/college paper this is probably not for you, but if you are looking for a visually stunning, entertaining movie and are prepared to enjoy I recommend this for you.",1293494400,,726,4.5

4030451,3,B002ZG9788,"This is basically an action movie drawing on ancient Greek mythology.  In that regard, it's interesting that Zeus created the human race, and yet he depends on human worship for his immortality while being unable to force humans to worship. Why this dependency?  On top of that, his demigod son Perseus prefers to live as a mortal human, even though he has the choice of living as an immortal god ...

Anyway, the movie is reasonably entertaining, though the action isn't enough to increase your heart rate much, if at all.  The special effects and scenery are good though, again, not best in class.  And the acting is likewise decent, with some well-known actors in the movie, though they don't have much to work with in terms of story or characters.  In short, not a total waste of time, but certainly not a movie I'd want to watch again.

Last but not least, my wife picked this out as a ""family"" movie, but be forewarned that the level of violence is probably too much for young children (hence the PG-13 rating).",1293235200,2,1017,4.585635359116022

4030614,3,B002ZG9788,"Mythology has always interested me even at a young age, the stories of mythical gods and creatures where and still are fascinating to me, Medusa, Pegasus, the Kraken and more.  It was only normal that I wanted to see what this movie made of these legends. This version of Clash of the Titans is a remake of the 1981 movie of the same name. Most film remakes today are criticized for particular reasons and this one falls into that category as well. Of course it's different from the original Class of the Titans, which is good because I don't want to watch a remake that's  exactly like the original, if I did I'd just watch the 1981 movie. As with almost every single remake this one left out some things but followed the story close enough, just not as well perhaps. I don't think this particular remake was awful or that it was excellent but it falls somewhere between the two, a good popcorn movie is a proper way of describing it.

CotT follows Perseus, half-man, half-god and son of Zeus lives in a time where man thinks he is bigger than the gods and where prayers are not welcomed. Hades convinces Zeus to let him create conflicts between humans for them to convert back to the gods. Perseus being the son of god is said to be the savior of man and must fights titanic creatures to save his kind. Nothing complicated as far as storytelling goes. What's interesting is Perseus doesn't want to be acknowledged as the son of Zeus, he doesn't embrace his destiny even if he does what is expected of him. Those who are familiar with mythology already know that there some things are not totally accurate but the movie remains an entertaining one if you can get over that fact. The scenes where the action is, the fights against the creatures, are the high points obviously. The scene with Medusa was a highlight for me; I thought it was great that they kept her in the same way as the original.

CofT has mostly been slammed by critics and didn't earn high ratings, here on Amazon it is currently rated an average of 3 stars which is a fair rating in my opinion and it is also how I rated the movie. To be honest this remake is entertaining but whereas the visuals were good the film falls short in the story department (I feel the story was executed in a better way in the 1981 version). Clash of the Titans is not a terribly bad movie but it's a little far from completely satisfying and it's hard not to compare with the 1981 original, which I feel is the better one. If you have seen the original or are simply interested in watching it I suggest that you do because it truly isn't as bad as some are reporting it to be, but I would advise to rent before buying. 3/5 stars.",1291939200,3,2680,4.364729458917836
4030615,4,B002ZG9788,"Greek mythology yields itself marvellously well to massive cinematic experiences. The wide shots include lots of very beautiful seashore, wilderness and forest scenes. These set the scenes wonderfully well for the adventure elements contained within this film. Also in this film, a lot of the creatures are presented, some friendly, and many that pose as formidable foes. A brave band of men set out on a journey to save the life of a princess after the foolish and arrogant boasts of a queen that was less than discrete.

Included in this 'fellowship' is Perseus (Sam Worthington), the son of Zeus.

The story is centered around the Greek city Argos. As the movie begins, there is a narration. We learn about the three main Olympians who battled in the distant past: the brothers Zeus (Liam Neeson), Poseidon (Danny Huston), and Hades (Ralph Fiennes). However, it was Hades who provided the means of defeating the Titans with his creation, the Kraken. After the Titans' defeat, Zeus created humans and ruled them, while Poseidon ruled the sea, but Hades, having been betrayed by Zeus, was forced to rule the Underworld. Zeus and Poseidon gain power from the prayers of humans, but Hades gets his power through fear.

Humanity has gotten tired of the Olympians, and their self-serving ways and has started to rebel against them, this has led to Hades being given the authority to loose the Kraken upon humanity. (But Hades has not forgotten the betrayal of Zeus in the past.)

This is a cinematic wonder with lots of very good CG animations that appear flawless. There is a lot of excitement and of particular focus was the encounter with Medusa - a lot of men were lost in this battle and it was simple awesome watching the men turn to stone.

This story may have been told a thousand times, but so what? This one is still worth seeing. If you like adventure and action, rest assured that this movie delivers on the goods big time.",1291939200,,1932,4.755223880597015

However, after the first 30 or so minutes, the movie sort of felt like the type of video game where you run around a little, encounter a boss fight, run around a little more, and encounter another boss fight...which is too bad. With this cast, and the special effects folks they had working on this, the film had some great potential.

Now, that said, I can't say that I didn't like the film. I saw it at the theater, and then rented it. I liked it both times. Not enough to buy it, or see it again for a long time; but it wasn't time wasted.

4030619,3,B002ZG9788,"When it comes to Ray Harryhausen there is no bigger fan of his work and films. When I heard about this remake I was excited, but after reading many reviews I decided to wait until it came on cable before seeing it. I happened to come across this Blu Ray very cheap and I took a chance. To my surprise, this remake isn't as bad as many have claimed, but does nothing to improve on the original either.

The special effects are a highlight in both versions, but in this film they are used sparingly. You never get a good look at the monsters, only quick cuts and fast motion I assume to hide the cracks in the CGI work? I know the younger generation see Ray Harryhausen's(RH)work as old fashioned or even quaint, but he is one of the pioneers of the craft and has and will continue to inspire generations of film makers long after this remake disappears into obscurity. It was fitting of the makers of this fim to put in a cameo of BoBo the owl as a nod to RH.

The story has been changed, but not for the better, only adding confusion and depriving us of a real hero. In RH's original film the story was more straightforward and even though a little corny at times, it did a better job of keeping the motives of the characters more believable.

Back to the special effects as this is really the reason to watch any Harryhausen film remake or not. I'm glad that they kept RH's design for Medusa as is it one of the coolest interpretations of her, even though not accurate by Mythological standards. As far as RH's stop motion work, I really don't think people are aware of the amount of work that RH put into the Medusa sequence in the original. Medusa's snake filled hair, her tail and all body movements are painstakingly done with the upmost finesse and skill. Even more amazing is that the flame lit lair is also something he had to take into consideration. Switching the light reflection frame by frame to make it look like flames flickering. Add in the fact the man was in the twilight of his career at almost 70 years old! It was nothing short of breathing taking in its time and I doubt it could ever be duplicated. If we factor in the money and time allowed to create this and all the other creature effects, it is unbelievable that it was completed. I would have loved to see what he could have done with a budget of the remake!

The Medusa in this film looks very good, but I think there is more tension in the original scene with her slowly stalking her intruders. In fact, most of the creatures in this remake serve only as a reminder of how great Harryhausen was at his craft, giving his creatures life and personality. The original film suffers from budget restraints that actually effect the look of the film, as all the prints I've seen of it are dark, grainy and the matte shots stick out like a sore thumb, so naturally this remake looks incredible by comparison.

The original has more creatures and the story is told in a more entertaining way, but the remake has some impressive special effects and a story that is not as corny. If only we could combine the two to make one great film. Clash of the Titans is a solid action adventure film with some nifty effects, but I will watch RH's version far more times than this one.",1290556800,10,3243,4.353719008264463

With hopes, I purchased ""Clash of the Titans"" Blu Ray in 3-D.  I was really looking forward to the film and being amazed because the two animated movies I have, ""Monsters vs Aliens"" and ""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"" are quite enjoyable in 3-D.

As soon as I put ""Clash"" into the Blu Ray player, I wondered if there was something wrong with my glasses.  I changed the batteries on my glasses, tried different pairs of glasses, and even checked to make sure I had the correct disc in the drive.  Everything seemed to be working.  I even replaced the disc with one ""Monsters vs..."" just to make sure my TV had not broken down.  The result is this: I do not believe that ""Clash of the Titans"" was even made into a 3-D version.  If you are hoping to be amazed with your TV's 3-D display capabilities, you better buy something else.  All ""Clash"" is, is simply a blurred background with no, AND I MEAN NO, 3-D imagery.  In fact, I am so disappointed, I plan on returning it (I hope) tomorrow.

4030809,2,B002ZG9788,"Okay, Bubo had a TOO brief (if exact in appearance) cameo but sadly, he was not otherwise there (sniff). Other than that, what's to say about this strange fusion of Greek/Christian Mythologies? Well, Sam Worthington ran around sounding more like Mel Gibson in Mad Max (which isn't entirely bad) and the film actually suggested some interesting and intriguing questions regarding the nature of God (or in this case, gods) and man but never really answered them. Not to mention asking them, using a Demigod as the protagonist, just didn't really work well. Kind of like this film, it just didn't really work well. CGI heavy, of course, but most of it was pretty good, maybe because it just works for this subject matter, I'm not sure. Although, on a side note, I'll take Harryhausen's Medusa any day over this strangely attractive one. Anyway, when I completed watching the film I was left feeling unsatisfied, while it had some great and interesting scenes and often captured some of the feel of the old one (as well as other Harryhausen films) probably due to Lettier's direction, ultimately, as I already stated, it just didn't come together as a complete film for me. Sometimes thoughtful and interesting, other times simply mindless and attractive, all the time, unbalanced. One final note, the Greek/Christian fusion annoyed the crap out of me (and always has) why does Hollywood (Disney was responsible last time for a Greek story) insist on giving mythologies a ""God of Abraham"" bend? I don't get it. If you've studied Greek Mythology you already know the Greek Gods behaved as if they were living an episode of Dallas or Falcon Crest. The Greek Gods were the Poster Children for, and predated, the Seven Deadly Sins, why mess with that? At least the old version of Clash of the Titans got that part mostly right. Anyway, I digress.

Is a terrible remake as the story is nothing like the original 1980s Clash Of The Titans, and it has less to do with the original myth of Perseus, it couldn't be more far and different from it.

Since no one own the rights to myths :P anyone can interpret the stories and characters as they see fit., but there they took way too much liberties than in the original Clash Of The Titans film. And unlike the original in this one they did not work at all.

Visually speaking the movie is a feast for the eyes: the sets, costumes, wonderful animation/special effects by CGI (computer generated images), as well as the music and cinematography. Sadly the story isn't as involving and deep as the mentioned.
A note on the gods costumes; they look like a direct plagiarism of the anime 1980s series of Saint Seiya AKA Knights Of The Zodiac. Shiny armors that represent a certain constellation and the olympian gods themselves.

I got the film for my birthday warned by all the bad reviews here in amazon.com, but did not abide by previous buyers. As a fan of all Greek myths I had to add it to my collection, now I should toss it in the trash where it belongs. The original Clash Of The Titans storyline is much better and richer than this one., since it was closer to the myth of Perseus. And had a story and a script that actually did make sense.

The clash between the gods and the humans, according to this film, was caused by the gods noticing that the humans stopped praying to them. The gods created the humans so that they would pray to them, and they need the prayers. The prayers make them stonger.

The pagans offered many reasons why the gods created humans. One, for example, was that they needed slave labor. But this tale says that the gods needed prayers. What do we think today? Does God need prayers?

Most people today would reject this notion. God, they would say, is perfect and needs nothing. Then why pray? Prayer, they say, helps humans in various ways.

Yet, people will be surprised to learn that not only some ancient pagans thought that God needs prayers, but there were and are Christians, Muslim, and Jews that thought and think so as well.",1286755200,,915,4.670807453416149

The riding of the giant scorpions like horses, the use of Hades as the villian - I could go on. The plot is drivel and the acting uninspired. The original was much more epic and mysterious.

Granted the special effects by master Ray Harryhausen seem dated, but the movie had more ""heart"". This version takes the original script and turns it around to the point of implausibility. The giant scorpian battle is a highlight but the effect is destroyed later on when the monster are used as transportation. Come on now!

In the original, the Gods of Olympus played an important part in the film, which made it more effective, here none of them are showcased except Liam Neeson as Zeus and even that is limited.

I was as disapointed in this remake as I was in the remake of ""The Wolfman"". Has Hollywood run out of ideas by constant remakes or using comic book and TV sitcoms as a basis for their films, or are they just playing it safe now. Unfortunately the dream factory was creating this havoc long before the meltdown.

This could have been a great movie, but was turned into a popcorn flick that really lacks any essence.  Characters were so underdeveloped that the audience didn't get a chance to connect to the characters on an emotional level, leaving nothing but mind numbing action and special effects. This could have been another Great epic like Lord of the Rings, with an excellent storyline and well developed characters combined with great special effects. But instead lacked all the above, except the special effects.

The story was rushed from the beginning and didn't give much insight into why the mortals were so defiant to the gods. More emphasis should have been given to the Greek mythology behind the movie and the human like character flaws of the gods themselves.  The movie did not follow the original movie as closely as I hoped and threw in some really cheesey looking characters, such as the mutant Pinocchio looking jinn and the chucky cheese animatronic looking ferry boat man. The one and only comical scene through the entire movie: the wacky mechanical owl from the original movie was briefly pulled out of a bag by Perseus as he says ""What is this?"" Pegasus was displayed as a black rather than white flying stallion, which did not sit right with me. Guess the black horse reminded of the black wraths from Lord of the Rings..lol

In comparing this film with the 1981 version, the remake is nothing more than a plastic glitter coated hollywood version of the original, the characters seem two dimensional and the story is full of holes and does not flow.  But of course, the monsters are much more realistic than special effects from 29 years ago. But is that all that makes a good movie?, hardly..

If Zeus has to give you a god-coin to get Charon to take you across the River Styx to get to the Medusa's lair, and then afterwards you get to hop on the Pegasus to just pop on back to Argos in a couple of hours after if took you ten whole days to get to the Medusa in the first place, then why didn't you just take the freekin' Pegasus in the first place, and just have it wait for you?  Jeebus!

Yeah, I get that we've got gods, demigods, demons and other non-human types futzing about all through the film, the whole line-between-Heaven-and-Earth thing going on, but the impossible human-oriented physics, like a 500-foot drop into water, and surviving, and then looking absolutely ravishing as you wash up on a beach that wasn't even in the falling-into-the-water scene just doesn't achieve that crucial movie requirement of getting me to suspend my disbelief.

Just junk.

The music has nothing to do with the greeks, or even with epic movies, or anything. Djawadi is just a sucker of Zimmer and get works just cos he is a student of him.

4031217,2,B002ZG9788,"Nearly 30 years after the original ""Clash of the Titans"" graced the silver screen, Hollywood has chosen to resurrect the gods of Greek mythology under the direction of action director Louis Letterier (""The Incredible Hulk"").

""Clash of the Titans"" follows a man named Perseus (Sam Worthington), who unbeknownst to him is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), as he travels in search of taking vengeance upon the dark god Hades (Ralph Fiennes). To complete his quest, Perseus will join forces with a group of warriors to face off against some of the fiercest creatures imaginable and prove that even a god can bleed.

With technology at a point where these legendary figures and monsters can look more realistic, awe-inspiring and/or terrifying than ever before, now seems like a fitting time to revisit this classic tale. Yet, with all of the visual spectacle on display and a director known for fast-paced, adrenaline pumping features, does this newest iteration live up to its obviously dated predecessor?

The answer...surprisingly, is no! For all of its visual panache those responsible for this film were far too preoccupied with wowing audiences with as much spectacle in under two hours as possible that the story got lost right from the start.

What little story there is, which by the way merely exists for the sole purpose of carrying the various characters and the audience from one fight to another, is written by the writing duo of Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (the writers responsible for the utterly lackluster ""Aeon Flux""). This paper-thin imitation of a screenplay is an insult to not only fans of the original film hoping for a modern day update with terrific storytelling and awesome visuals, but to the enduring myths that spawned these legendary characters in the first place.

How exactly is this film's story insulting? Well, let's start with the biggest part of the film, which is the human story. This aspect of the story is rushed along at an incredibly fast pace, which somewhat works to the film's advantage in that the audience doesn't really have time to see its faults. Yet, at the same time it's detrimental in that one never really gets a sense as to why we should even remotely care for the people on screen. There is next to nothing in terms of character development, both on Earth and on Olympus, and the various character motivations are so weak that I never once believed any of them would actually go to such great lengths to succeed in their mission.

When a movie deals with such otherworldly themes, it is vital that the human element be presented as strongly as possible to ground the movie in some semblance of a reality. Not to mention allow for the audience to connect with the various characters so we can actually become enthralled by their journey. This aspect is never given time to develop and as a result there is zero emotional investment, leaving the audience numb to the experience.

Another major issue facing this film's plot is that the gods themselves are ancillary characters that receive only marginal screen time. The original (if memory serves) featured numerous sequences focusing solely on the gods of Olympus overseeing us mere mortals on Earth. Due to the merely passing glimpses we receive of the gods, we're left with the main crux driving the godly portion of the story being relegated to the opening 90 seconds of the film.

This approach to exposition is fine when handling a remake of a film only a few years old where audiences don't need a lot of rehash (i.e. Louis Letterier's remake/reboot of 2003's ""Hulk"" with 2008's ""The Incredible Hulk""); however, this is not the method to use for the redo of a nearly 30-year old property where a good old fashioned refresher course is warranted.

Fans of these classic tales want more depth, and the Greek myths demand more substance to coincide with all of the flash that modern day visual effects houses can provide. The stories surrounding these legendary figures should not be mentioned only in passing, I mean the story elements at your disposal could have sustained a two to three hour Hollywood epic (which is what this film should have been all along).

Not to mention we receive nary a glimpse at any of the gods' powers in use, an aspect I thought would possibly run the risk of being over-used instead of little to none. Aside from the releasing of the infamous Kraken (as was so heavily touted in the myriad of trailers for this film) only Medusa and Hades are given time to display some of their abilities.

Come on Louis, you skimmed over the mythological history of these characters, the least you could have delivered to us is a smorgasbord of their powers and abilities on display throughout. Seriously, how great would it have been to see Zeus unleashed or Poseidon or (insert your choice here). What were you thinking not going crazy with some massive display of power from the inhabitants of Olympus? Something like that seems like it would be a visual effects wizard's dream come true. But I digress.

While on the topic of the film's visuals, the various effects houses in charge of bringing these elements to life produced a surprisingly mixed bag of results. For the most part, the visuals are quite impressive, some even borderline stunning, while others look too obvious or even cartoonish in nature. Personally, despite some weak spots, I enjoyed the updated visuals that are featured in this incarnation over those of Ray Harryhausen from the original, simply because most look so much more life-like and realistic than anything that stop-motion animation could ever even dream of achieving.

One particular segment that I found to be well done was the giant scorpion fights (another sequence that was heavily shown in the previews). This long fight scene was visually impressive and generally entertaining; although, maybe we could have shortened that sequence by a couple of minutes to make room for showcasing some of the other gods' powers.

It really is a shame that instead of capitalizing on the technology at their fingertips to create awesome visuals worthy of the Greek myths, we're left with gods who simply stood around and talked all day long. Not to mention, an overly long giant scorpion fight that became far too repetitive before it finally came to a close.

Now, I must turn my disappointment towards the cast of this forgettable remake. Headlining the cast, despite his limited acting range and number of roles under his belt, is the ever stoic Sam Worthington. As Perseus, Sam is basically asked to combine the strongest, athletic, and action-oriented parts of his previous notable roles from ""Terminator: Salvation"" and ""Avatar"" and channel them into this character. Even with his limited talent pool in terms of dramatic acting, I will say that Sam at least put forth an effort in his previous performances; however, in this film his acting is on action movie autopilot.

This time around the only facial expressions Sam displays are anger, a few moments of laughter, and poorly conveyed sadness; of course, I can't forget, the look that comprised the majority of his screen time, namely his go-to expression...the stern, blank stare. As for the other facets of his performance, his line readings were as bland and wooden as ever, although in his defense, it didn't appear that the script really called for much more effort. Beyond those two sub-par aspects of his performance, not surprisingly Sam delivered on the action-oriented side of the role. While he won't be nominated for any Academy Awards for his ""dramatic"" work on this film, Sam should be a guaranteed nominee for the MTV Movie Awards' ""Best Action Star"" award.

In the primary supporting roles are three extremely talented actors, Liam Neeson (""Taken""), Ralph Fiennes (""Harry Potter"" films), and the man who portrayed one of the best James Bond villains in quite some time, Mads Mikkelson (""007: Casino Royale""). Personally, I'm extremely disappointed in Liam and Ralph for even taking part in this film. Because at this point in their careers they have enough clout in Hollywood (not to mention money) that they could have either demanded a better script (one with dare I say...character development) or just walked away in order to save face. As for Mads, well he probably doesn't have the clout or as much money, so his participation could be better understood.

Still, all of the above actors possess acting talent far superior to what they put on display in this film. Truth be told though, it was their involvement in this movie that gave the proceedings some credibility, albeit ever so slightly.

One last bit of gripes about the cast. The two prominent female roles in this film were either completely thankless (Gemma Arterton's role of Io) or nothing more than a plot device (Alexa Davalos as Andromeda). Both actresses have shown considerable acting chops in previous work, yet as with everyone else in this film, there's nothing worthy of note in their performances here.

The only thing I can figure for why these actors and actresses signed on to this movie was the chance to be a part of a burgeoning Hollywood franchise. Now, that statement does not apply to Sam Worthington. I believe that for him any chance to play a role that calls for little to no emotion is an opportunity that he's going to jump at with gusto. But, for the others, that's the only excuse I can come up with. At least the temptation of a franchise is something I can understand; if it turns out to be anything else, then they should all be ashamed.

Sadly, despite all of this film's potential to become an incredible epic blockbuster, all that those involved in the project managed to cultivate was just another silly summer popcorn movie. Granted, I have enjoyed many a silly summer popcorn movie, but this one wasn't even all that entertaining.

Despite my obvious disdain for this remake, the movie managed to make plenty of money. So, the powers-that-be are moving full-steam ahead on a second installment. Hopefully, they'll correct some of the glaring mistakes from this opening chapter, and make a movie truly worthy of the mythological characters inhabiting this series' universe.

""Clash of the Titans"" is rated PG-13 for violence and brief language.",1285372800,6,10273,4.894767107533065

These types of movies have been around for a long time, not excepting the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clash-of-the-Titans/dp/B002ZD3V10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clash of the Titans</a>&nbsp;film. Sometimes you're just in the mood to sit back, turn off your brain, and enjoy the action that unfolds in front of you.

But then there are movies that require an extra amount of brain-power just to understand the convoluted events of the plot, and which leave you feeling frustrated and drained at how little sense it makes. Thus we have the remake of ""Clash of the Titans"", which is really an excuse for one hundred and six minutes of CGI monsters, with a vague plot, non-existent characterization, and semi-passable fight scenes on the side. Of course, this all may still float your boat, but if you prefer to have some *semblance* of coherence in your popcorn flicks then either stick with the campy fun of the original, or skip it altogether.

As an infant Perseus is found by a fisherman floating in a sea-chest alongside his dead mother, and grows up without any knowledge of his origins: that he's actually the son of the god Zeus. Now an adult, Perseus is witness to the death of his foster father, mother and little sister when a group of soldiers from Argos destroy a statue of Zeus and pay the hefty consequences of hubris. For reasons best known to themselves, human beings have decided that ticking off deities is a really good idea, and the Olympian gods respond with releasing an onslaught of monsters in order to increase the prayers that they need to retain their immortality. Why not just call a summit meeting?

Due to this nonsensical state of affairs, Perseus and a group of interchangeable soldiers who exist only as cannon fodder head out on a mission to kill some monsters, accumulate some weapons, and walk across impressive panning shots of the countryside, which will somehow help them defeat the kraken that Hades, Lord of the Underworld, has promised to unleash on Argos if they do not sacrifice Princess Andromeda within ten days. Joining them is Io, an immortal hottie burdened with the terrible curse of being young and beautiful forever, a character that in the original Greek mythology was turned into a cow, tortured by a gadfly, and had nothing whatsoever to do with Perseus. I suppose these days a female isn't considered a worthy love interest unless she tags along with the boys on their adventure, but she never does much to help and her inclusion renders Andromeda's role largely pointless.

They also pick up an eastern-style character who is called a Djinn but which looks like Pinocchio's deformed brother, and a couple of guys who I think are meant to be the comic relief, except that they never actually tell any jokes.

Throughout the running time, the movie seems to want to make some sort of point about humanity and the gods, but it keeps changing its mind on what exactly this point is. The population of Argos is arrogant and sinful for rejecting the gods; but then the gods are petty and corrupt in their dealings with humanity. Zeus gives Hades permission to ""set an example"" for those who oppose them, but then tries to help Perseus in his god-defying quest to prevent Hades from destroying Argos. Draco (one of Perseus's mates) demands in one scene that Perseus accept Zeus as his father in order to spare the lives of his men, and in the next he says: ""I'll smile when I spit in the face of the gods."" Io solemnly tells the men the tragic tale of Medusa, who was raped by Poseidon and then cruelly cursed by Athena, which is followed by a scene in which Perseus pep-talks his men outside her lair by telling them to: ""kill this bitch."" Perseus rejects his godly heritage (though he doesn't pass on the flying horse, immortal girlfriend or built-in demigod powers) and declares to anyone who'll listen that mortality is superior to godhood, even though there's not much evidence of that.

Despite all the railing against the gods and the rah-rah cheerleading for Team Humankind, the movie ends with an odd reestablishing of the pecking order, in which Zeus and Perseus are reconciled, Hades is sent back to Hades and Io is magically resurrected because.... hey, why not? There's some sort of message here, in which the writers desperately want to tell us something about the nature of humanity and its relationship to gods, if only they could figure out what that message was.

It's been a while since I've watched the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clash-of-the-Titans/dp/B002ZD3V10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clash of the Titans</a>, but there's no doubt that it's a superior film to this, even discounting the nostalgia quotient that leaves me with fond memories of its inherent campiness and stop-motion monsters. Not only does it boast finer actors and a more faithful adaptation of the Perseus legend, but it is also nobler in content and theme. There, Perseus was on a heroic quest to save innocent people and win the love of a princess. Here, he's just after vengeance, a far less worthy goal.

Though this remake will undoubtedly be an instant favorite for any 10 to 12 year old boy, they'd be better off getting a slice of cinematic history by watching the last film that featured Ray Harryhausen's stop-action monsters. Speaking of which, there's a throwaway gag in the remake that will have fans of the original film fuming, in which Perseus picks up a mechanical owl and then dismissively chucks it away again. I think it's meant to be a ""tribute"" of sorts to Harryhausen's Bubo, but it just comes across as mildly insulting.

All of the actors, from Liam Neeson (who seems to be wearing mirror-plated armor) to Ralph Fiennes (once again portraying the much-maligned Hades as a baddie), and Sam Worthington (why does he have a buzz-cut?) to Gemma Artherton (who is always immaculate no matter how dirty her traveling companions get) are on autopilot. I have no doubt they picked up their checks at the doors and scurried onto their next projects without looking back.

If ""Clash of the Titans"" is not what I would call a good slice of entertainment, it at least will provide plenty of snarky commentary if watched in a group. Perhaps a drinking game could be designed for whenever the mortals complain about the gods and visa versa - though given the writers' insistence on repeating this plot-point at every available opportunity, your liver may not survive the experience.",1285372800,90,7469,5.40893470790378

4031221,3,B002ZG9788,"Like many others, I was a fan of the earlier version of Clash of the Titans.  This modern version is plagued by all the same problems that seem to be a part of today's movie making: the makers let the special effects dominate the movie, and dismiss everything else.  I loved this movie for the special effects, and it is worth watching, and even owning, just for that alone. The characters, the monsters, the battle scenes, the gods, etc. were all worth the price of admission.  My favorite part is that the winged stallion Pegasus is jet black, and has a herd of pure white winged mares. But I would have liked a little more story.  Another of the problems this movie has is its' near complete lack of color.  Everything is in muted shades of bronze, brown, black, gray and cream.  It totally amazes me that today, with fantastic fabrics in every color of the rainbow easily available, no one in Hollywood seems to think to use them.  For all the colors this movie has, it might just as well have been filmed in black and white.  Not to mention that many of the scenes, like the confrontation with Medusa, are so very dark that it is hard to make out the action.  Directors today seem bogged down by ""historical accuracy"" and ""true to life"".  But this story is not a history lesson, it is a fable.  The original Clash of the Titans remembered that it was a fairy tale,  used beautiful fabric and bright colors, had characters in it that looked like they bathed, and had bright backgrounds filled with light that let the audience see what was going on.  With the modern version, I felt like I should run it through a computer, and add color and light to it. As it is, the heros are brown, the monsters are brown and the backgrounds are brown.

Moreover, the makers of this movie did nothing to tell even a bare bones story.  There is no reason in this movie for Perseus to rescue Andromeda, or to risk his life for the city---he is a stranger to the princess, and the people of the city have not exactly been friendly to him.  He is imprisoned, tortured and then forced into taking on the quest.  He should have taken off the first chance he got.  The idea that he has some vague idea of getting back at the gods is not sufficient.

This movie is worth watching, with fantastic special effects, but I would have loved to see how much better it could have been with bright colors, more light and a better story.",1285286400,4,2410,4.387387387387387

Instead, we get boring and pointless. I think that is the key word here, Pointless. Lets see, the logic of this remake is: mortals are tired of the GODS petty and ruthless rule over them, so they rebel (sans Hercules TV Series). The GODS demonstrate, repeatedly and unquestionably, their limitless power over the puny humans. In other words, it's made crystal clear that simple mortals CAN NOT WIN against the GODS. So they are being really, really stupid for even trying; and the viewer is left scratching his head almost from the start of the movie, thinking ""boy, are these people suicidal idiots, or what?"" Simultaneously, to keep the title relevant (it is 'Clash of the Titans'---not 'Clash of men and gods,' afterall), we have a sub-plot of Hades trying to knock off Zeus and take the top spot on Mt. Olympus. So who do we, the audience, cheer for in this free-for-all. The mortals who can't and never will win, or Zeus, who is made out to be both a villian for fighting poor, enslaved humanity, and a savior, for opposing evil Hades? Which is it?

Unfortunately characterization suffers.  And Sam Worthington may be a good actor, but he looks more like a soccer player or a marine here than a son of the gods.

It appears that most of the budget for the film went to the special effects, which are admittedly pretty special.  The Kraken, giant scorpions, Pegasus, and Medusa in particular are something to see, a vast improvement over the charming but limited Harryhausen stop-motion creations of decades past.

But the big-name cast is pretty limited: Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes carry some weight as Zeus and Hades, but the only other name players here aside from Worthington are Gemma Arterton and Pete Postlethwaite.  The original ""Clash"" boasted, of course, Laurence Olivier, Burgess Meredith, Harry Hamlin, Ursula Andress, and numerous others.

While Clash '81 may be Ray Harryhausen's final legacy to a brilliant career and the center of reminiscence for many a child growing up or being born in that decade, I'm going to be honest and say I thought Clash '81 was a good, but not great movie. The reason being because I recently saw Jason and the Argonauts, a film that clearly surpasses Clash '81 in almost every conceivable category be it storytelling, special effects, overall production, and even BD presentation. 18 years after the fact and Clash '81 barely feels like an upgrade over Jason in terms of.. well, anything. The stop animation is barely on par, while the pacing and narrative are even a tad weaker, and yet it's still treasured just for the sake of nostalgia. When I heard a new version of Clash was being directed by Louis Letterier, I was pretty excited. Being familiar with his previous works I knew he came from an action background as a protg under Luc Besson and that he'd easily find ways to improve the shortcomings of the original to make a more fulfilling fantasy epic. Aside from character and location names, that's about all both movies have in common. And in creating his version from scratch, I feel Letterier has managed to make a very good and entertaining action flick that's not so much a remake, but rather an adaptation for today's audiences. It's a darker, grittier, and more violent film with all sorts of new characters, themes, and special effects that make for better and faster-paced storytelling. Instead of the playful nature of the original where the gods were just bickering over superiority and toying around with their chessboard, or the way Perseus just slowly made his way from point to point with little to no difficulty, I actually felt a deeper sense of drive and purpose from this new version. For starters, the gods actually show emotion: desperation for the love/fear of the people and the power it gives them, jealousy, spite, and vengeance through deception (between Zeus and Hades), and even a little bit of humility (in what Zeus learns about man from Perseus). Meanwhile, the new Perseus actually has some character depth as well: his demi-god blood puts him at odds with the people he's trying to help, while his pride in being raised as a man makes him stubborn in accepting his god-given gifts and heritage, yet he still chooses to fight the oppressive rule of the gods and show them the virtues of being a man. These themes obviously don't get as much exposure as they should, what with a mere 95 minutes of screen time. But having set this foundation of ideals, hopefully the sequels will expand upon them. Much like Letterier's The Incredible Hulk, watch it for the action, but expect hints of story and character.

Video - 4.5

While the photography of Clash '10 does, indeed, have a kind of a processed look, it's actually not that bad. I would personally attribute it to something along the lines of visual effects and/or tweaks made during post-production that, at times, gives certain scenes either a kind of shiny or hazy look (like Mount Olympus and the gods' Saint Seiya armor or the ferry trip across the River Styx). But despite the near-grainless appearance, picture quality looks excellent. Colors from the costuming, set design, beautifully-shot backgrounds, and various creatures still possess a degree of vibrancy from the palace props and soldiers' gear, to the lush greens of the forest and fiery reds of Medusa's lair, to the murky brown scales and tentacles of the Kraken. Black levels are nice and inky, though not too deep, but with great shadow delineation, as seen in the black Pegasus or Stygian Mountain when the witches are introduced. Contrast provides for accurate brightness when need be, though the film itself tries to be a little too dark at times and, thus, loses some detail in people and objects leading to bits and pieces of softness. On the bright side, there don't appear to be any signs of Edge Enhancement or DNR, and the picture is completely free of artifacts and debris. CG integration is especially smooth, with highlights being the various appearances of Hades and, of course, the aforementioned Kraken. It should also be noted that 90% of the backgrounds are not even green screen, which amazes me that places like that even exist, so be sure to take those images in as you see them.

Audio - 5.0

Besides the cinematography and special effects, one of my favorite improvements with this new Clash is its sound. Granted the original, like many a Harryhausen feature, was a bit on the low-budget side of production, but it's nice to see and hear the differences in advancement. Dialogue is clear and undistorted through the center and does a great job staying audible amongst the action, while the growls of Zeus and the haunting whispers of Hades give the script a much-appreciated Thespian quality. Directionality has an excellent sense of depth with sounds and action filling their respective speakers when needed, most notably in the battle against Medusa as she rattles and slithers about her temple. Separation is also spot-on with effects and music dispersing equally through the fronts and rears to accompany the situation. While it's a shame Craig Armstrong was dropped as composer (love his work for The Incredible Hulk), Ramin Djawadi's stuff isn't so bad. I actually like his score for Iron Man, and it was nice to hear him try something with more orchestral instrumentation. If you like brass, expect to hear a lot of it. And finally, LFEs aren't as frequent as I expected, but they really pack a punch when they occur. The thundering of Zeus's bolts in the sky, the Scorpinochs battle, and the rising of the Kraken will give your subwoofer a thoroughly progressive workout as each scene unfolds and builds upon the narrative. The overall track may or may not be reference to some, probably depending on your standards for LFEs, but given that there really aren't a whole lot of instances for LFEs to shine in the first place, this might be enough for others.

Extras - 4.0

This is my second time ever for a Maximum Movie Mode (the first being Sherlock Holmes). And while it's a tad disappointing Letterier couldn't do the entire thing in person, I actually still liked the commentary, regardless. Instead of the 2-screen, 1-director approach, we get a 2-3-screen presentation where the movie plays bigger and the commentary/interviews play in a smaller screen and takes turns switching priority. In-between these segments, icons for Focus Features will pop up and allow the user to watch a branched-off making-of sequence that lasts about 2-4 minutes per Feature for about 35 minutes total. These Focus Features do not constitute the entire MMM, by the way, and can be viewed separately from the MMM itself if you want. In addition to the Focus Features, the MMM actually takes up a good majority of the film providing lots of cool factoids and opinions from the cast and crew about the filming, design, production, writing, stunt work, and just about everything else. Objectively, all the information probably would've made a fine behind-the-scenes featurette on its own. But to watch it in real-time during the movie is what I think really raises my appreciation the most. The MMM literally explains and expands on every little bit of the movie piece by piece, and I applaud everyone involved for their hard work and perseverance. To top it all off, there's also an 8-minute feature on Sam Worthington that talks about the fact that he did most of his own stunts (a little generic, but I applaud his toughness), deleted scenes that would've completely changed the context of the story, and an alternate ending that wasn't as good as I'd hoped. It's not a lot of extras in terms of quantity, but the quality of it for the MMM alone is worth a look.

Overall - 4.5

Nostalgia will probably be the deal-breaker for most people wanting to see this movie. If you prefer the original version for its light-heartedness and more campy demeanor, chances are you won't like this new version because of its inclination toward a darker, grittier atmosphere. If you're like me and one of the few fans of Letterier that can appreciate his forte for action while also realizing this is just the beginning of a trilogy, then maybe you'll like this version enough and forgive a lot of its newer elements in writing and character portrayal. With excellent video, reference audio, and a commentary feature that continues to amaze me, Clash of the Titans (2010) comes highly recommended.",1283817600,3,8568,4.8390177353342425

This  movie got a lot of flack for being hastily ""converted"" to 3D at the last minute before being released to theaters. But I thought it actually looked pretty good. I watched it in 3D at home on a regular TV using my TV Eyes 3D glasses. (They're a type of optical 3D glasses that makes regular movies look 3D without having to use a 3D TV or 3D movie).

The effects really looked good. Medusa in her wrecked castle, slithering around everywhere, her whipsnake body lashing and curling over all the pillars looked amazing. Loved the effect when she turned people to stone.

There were several really good 3D scenes, the toppling of the statue of Zeus, with Perseus's family ship in the ocean below the cliffs, you could really see all the way out to the horizon. The confrontation between Zeus and Hades in Olympus. Hades appearing in the hall like a giant angel of death. The attack of the giant scorpions. And, of course, the Kraken. I especially loved the flying chase scene where Perseus, on Pegasus, has to chase one of the harpies all over the besieged city to get back Medusa's head that it had stolen.

Overall, a very visually vibrant movie. It had a good mythological feel to it. A straightforward story without being too simple. Lots of heroism as Perseus fights not only the monsters, but the gods, and the other humans expectations of him.

The star, who also starred in Avatar, was especially good, I thought. Believable without ever overpowering the role with his ""stardom"" that's a great quality in an actor. He makes the character come to life.

I gave this movie 4 stars. It's not the most amazing movie ever made, but it is a great way to spend a couple of hours on a lazy afternoon. And it looked great in 3D on my TV. Beautiful stuff. (Especially the location shoots which were very atmospheric and lush.)",1283472000,,1968,4.573863636363637

4031458,1,B002ZG9788,"In short 1981 was a romance/adventure story with real character development, whereas 2010 is nothing more than a cheap action flick watched once and quickly forgotten.

The Amazon Reviewer, Robert Horton, discredits the original 1981 version in many ways during his ""comparison"" of these films. The 2010 remake shows its lack of respect for the 1981 version quite clearly within the first twenty minutes when Perseus looks through the ""trash"" of old equipment and pulls out a replica of the 1981 golden owl and the head of the expedition tells him to just leave it. The golden owl is then tossed back into the crate like a piece of garbage, so was the great story and characters of the 1981 version.

The 2010 version harvests all the action sequences of the original and throws them together one right after the other non-stop with no breaks to really tell a story or advance character development. In this 3D state of the art film, the characters are left with all the depth of 1D stick-figures - especially compared to the 1981 version where their leads are fleshed out - even the golden owl of 1981 has more personality than 2010's Perseus.

I usually give movies a chance to redeem themselves in the end. The last time I wanted to walk out on a movie was Batman Forever. This movie I turned off about 20 minutes in.

First of all, it has absolutely nothing to do with the original, a movie I grew up loving as a child. Secondly, it has absolutely nothing to do with the actual Greek myth it is based on. And thirdly, it is full of plot holes and inconsistencies as to make the story a farce of itself.

As you are watching you are forced to wonder things like, how does Perseus manage a buzz cut in Ancient Greece when everyone else in the movie has authentic hair? Why do the gods sit around wearing shiny armor when they are . . . you know, gods? Why do the humans build a gigantic statue of Zeus and then, in rebellion, destroy it? After all, aren't they just destroying their own work? How does Perseus mother know she has been raped by Zeus when he transforms back into god form . . . did they have photos of him somewhere? How does Perseus' father survive a lightning bolt? And why does he develop superhuman strength afterward, enabling him to lift a coffin with his wife and baby in it? The nonsense goes on and on.

And I can't get over the whole man vs. god thing. It's ridiculous and has nothing to do with how any ancient person would ever think. Nor can I imagine how any society could try to kill the gods, when the gods give them the air to breathe, food to eat, water to drink, etc. The original film understood the myths and portrayed ancient Greek mentality much more accurately.

On the plus side the action scenes with the big monsters were put together very well. The rest was pretty cruddy. First was the casting. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes have worn out their welcomes with me. If I never see them in another movie it will be too soon. Liam phoned it in and Ralph was so awful he must have been really upset that he was even in the movie. The rest of the cast was OK but nothing stellar which might be due to the fact that few of them had all that much to do. In all fairness, when the band of adventurers was formed for the quest (the two brothers were a hoot) there was a sense of male bonding happening, and most of the actors did a decent job, but even this has been done much better before. Sam Worthington did a fine job and somehow his lines were better than everyone else'. As bad as this script and the dialogue was his lines were generally good. It were as though the producers had a personal writer for him.

The directing was mostly horrendous. The camera always seemed to be in the wrong place. These types of movies have gotten so much better over the years. You'd think the director, Louis Leterrier, would have watched a few of them to get some kind of clue on how to do this. That's another curiosity. How could he direct some of the action scenes so well and most of the others so poorly. Go figure.

The costuming was pretty horrid as well. Much of the hair styling stunk and the music was OK but forgettable.

The story was there. It's just a shame it was so mishandled. I like these kinds of movies and went into this wanting to savor all the good parts. Problem was....there were too few of them to savor.",1282780800,,1859,4.228169014084507

The second disappointment was the shallow of the characters  The ones in the original 1980 script moved me with their depth and human feelings. Of course the special effects of the '80 movie were laughable.

The fighting special effects of this film were a mixed bag. In one hand, it's very impressive. For example, the giant scorpions looked scary, and  real. On the other it's disturbingly disappointing because the it was filmed so quickly and jerkily I could hardly saw what was happening.

Yes, the special affects weren't nearly as good as the 2010 version's were, but the scenes where far deeper than the 2010'a. Point and case: the Medusa scenes. In the 1981 version, they arrive at the edge of the underworld and are preparing to enter the ruined temple in which Medusa lives. I thought it was an awesome suspense affect that you could hear her rattle but you didn't know where she was coming from, and you couldn't look or else you'd be turned to stone. Add to that, she looked demonic. That was the most intense scene to me. In the 2010 version, I just thought it was kind of cheesy that she was laughing and that the scene was more action than action and suspense. This is coming from a 21 year old. I wasn't even around when the 1981 version came about. But I love the effects of the 2010 version, but I like the older one much more. Just my two cents. :)",1282348800,2,1021,4.295336787564767
4031669,5,B002ZG9788,"Maybe its my age but I had a helluva good time watching this movie.  I saw the negative press and reactions from co-workers and friends so I stood away from viewing it on the big screen and boy, can I ever kick myself.  The film emerges as a hommage to the sword and fantasy films of the sixties and the Saturday Matinee excursions that erupted at that time.  I was never a fan of the original film.  I always thought that it was too childlike and some of Ray Harryhausen's work was not up to par and the performances seem to be forced , becoming a veritable who's who of British cinema at that time.  Director Louis Leterrier has successfully updated the storyline and piles on the thrills as never before while never sacrificing his actors, instead they become part of the tapestry of magical images that the Special Effects have become in the last decade. The set pieces are all here,  Never have I seen such an incredible incarnation of the Medusa legend as in this film. When Perseus and his men leave Charon's ship, they encounter a petrified forest of trees and bodies which reminds us of the scene in 'MEDUSA AGAINST THE SON OF HERCULES', the volcanic wasteland within Medusa's lair reminds us of Hades in Mario Bava's 'HERCULES IN THE HAUNTED WORLD', The Pegasus introduction reminded me of the Steve Reeves/Arthur Lubin fantasy from the sixties 'THE THIEF OF BAGHDAD', the scorpion sequence reminds us of their old relatives in Willis O'Briens 'THE BLACK SCORPION' from the fifties and the Kraken sequence has peppered hommages to 'KING KONG', the list goes on.  Even the character of BUBO from the original film is shown and tossed aside by one of the men.  Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes actually resemble two jealous brothers vying for power and they chew up the scenery with just the right bravado.  The music score by Ramin Djawadi is excellent and rousing rising to the occasions throughout.  All in all, a wonderful experience and a film which did not deserve the negativisms it received.  Great eye candy and escapist fare making you truly believe that there really are winged horses among us.  Thats a pretty tall order in these robotically modern times.

Let's be honest here though, would anyone really want to see this movie if it were a scene by scene remake.  I mean the one thing I hated about the remake of Halloween, other than it sucked, was the last 30 mins.  Trust me that was actually the best part of that whole movie. But why in the world would I want to see the same movie I've seen before, just 30 years later.  I believe most of the people who hate these kinds of movie hate it because it's nothing like the original.  Honestly, if it were like the original than why would you want to watch it.  I loved the original when I was a kid, it was my favorite movie.  I for one actually like the fact that even some of the parts were the same, that it was told a little different. I agree with somone else who made a comment abotuh Worthington. I mean where in the world did this guy come from.  He had a big part in Terminator, and he's in every movie now.  I remember someone else who just came out of no where, and that was Hugh Jackman. Where has that guy gone to.  Like I said I liked the improved look of all the monsters. I thought they were neat looking, but if you ae looked for the exact same movie as 30 years ago, you are looking in the wrong place.  Just take the movie for what it's worth.

4031783,2,B002ZG9788,"It seems to be that lately we have been inundated with a rash of movies that are perfectly content with being decent, but not great. Particularly this year I was left the movie theatre feeling that I was entertained, but that what I saw was just missing something. Maybe movie makers don't really want to take chances anymore, and they like to retread the same old formulas out there because they are safe. They would rather a movie be safely average and make money than take chances on greatness and have a bomb. I don't know that I really fault them for this logic. Great movies don't always equal more money, or even any money at all. Greatness in film is often not appreciated by the masses and the benign blockbuster film with good advertising generally is. In fact a couple of movie insiders from the Scene Unseen Movie review podcast often have said that the key to making money with a movie actually has nothing to do with its quality, only the quality of its advertising. This movie has that sort of thing going for it to a certain degree. They advertised the fooey out of this thing. Lots of epic shots of monsters and of Liam Neeson saying ""Release the Kraken."" This movie was going to make a decent amount of bank just because of the advertising campaign, and recoup a lot of its making costs. Once again I can't really fault the movie companies for this, it does make them money. However, I really don't like it when the advertising is the best part of the film, and when the trailers give a false impression as to the plot of the movie. (in this film its who the primary antagonist is) On the whole I didn't leave the theatre feeling that I hadn't enjoyed my time, I found the film enjoyable enough, and I didn't feel like it was wasted. Its not a bad movie and I wouldn't tell people that they shouldn't see it if they like this type of film. But it was a decidedly average film, not great and the question I keep asking myself is with this wealth of source material how can you not make a great film? I mean seriously this is a remake of an already pretty darn good film, so they can only go up from there right? This film does a few things right. The period people (although no more accurate than any other movie) felt right. I bought into the fact that these were an ancient people. The costumes looked really good, with the exception of Zeus' light can't quite focus on you armor, which just looked silly and cheesy. Sam Worthington, although not exceptional, gave a far better turn than he did in Avatar, and his performance was solid. Ralph Fiennes was as freaky and scary as he always is in these roles, and frankly I think the movie could have benefitted from more of his. Liam Neeson was fine, but he wasn't really given all that much to do. Zeus was actually far less epic and frequent in the film that the trailers would have you believe. Once again, not Neeson's fault, and he wasn't bad, aside from his terrible armor, he just wasn't given much to do. The movie did a few things badly that really detracted from the film. Firstly, I immediately got popped out with believability with Sam Worthington in this role. I know he was a demi-God, and physically stronger and all of that, but young Perseus has a conversation with his adopted father when he was, at the oldest ten. Then it pops up 12 years later, and it shows Worthington. I leaned over to my friend that was watching the movie with me and said ""Huh, 22 years old and he already has crows feet."" He responded, ""hard life man."" Its just really hard to buy him as a 20 year old kid. Even a 20 year old demi-god kid. My question is, why pop up the 12 years later subtext at all? It had no bearing to the plot, its not like it wasn't obvious this was sometime in the future, why do it? All it did was make people go huh, that 20 year old looks 35. But that's just a personal peeve of mine, and I am sure that wouldn't annoy most people. Other than that this movie had real problems in production, not so much in the acting and story. It looked like the shot the film with actually 8mm retro color film. Sometimes that's not a bad look, but in this film it kind of made things look washed out, with a lack of vibrancy. Everything kind of looked gray scale and it was not pleasing at all. The monsters looked a little to cartoony for the gravity of the situation, and for you old school gamers the Kraken totally looked like one of the Weapon's bosses from Final Fantasy 7, or even Bahamut from Advent Children. If you haven't seen the original go and see that one instead of this one, it's a better movie, but this one is still entertaining enough despite its flaws, so if this type of movie interests you, then by all means go out and see it. If you love the original, you will probably be disappointed, but if not, you will just have a couple hours of mindless action entertainment.",1281916800,,4866,4.330777656078861

4031788,3,B002ZG9788,"Due to word of mouth I was expecting the worse from Clash of the Titans. Was this film going to be another special effects ride with little or no character development?  This seems to be a trend in fantasy films since the Scorpion King. Some of my fears we realized, but there are definitely some handsomely mounted scenes and some of the action sequences are original. The story is essentially the same as the original Clash of the Titans, which featured Ray Harryhausen's last foray into special effects. Harryhausen's stop-motion effects were more whimsical and fit the time period better, but this film offers more sophisticated computer animation. However, is this kind of slickness really necessary for a fantasy film? I find these effects a much better fit for science fiction. For example, the Medusa in this film almost moves too slickly. Harryhausen's rigidly moving stop motion Medusa was somehow creepier. Still the scenes with the Medusa are quite chilling, and the background design of her lair is very atmospheric.
The action scenes are well mounted, but they tend to be a little over done. CGI has allowed directors to pull off stunts they otherwise could never accomplish, but periodically they are so outlandish they stretch believability. Fortunately, the special aren't quite as ludicrous as those seen in 2012, which bordered on the ridiculous.
I don't think the cast in this feature is charismatic as the original. How could you lose when the original featured Laurence Olivier as Zeus, and Maggie Smith as Thetis? However, in this latest film Liam Neeson makes an imposing Zeus, and makes the best of the material he was given. At times the screen play is even more simple minded than the original, but there is so much more action you barely notice.",1281830400,,1773,4.949664429530201

4031790,5,B002ZG9788,"Ok, let's be honest. The original ""Clash Of The Titans"" was made by the same guy who made the Sinbad movies. He casted nobody actors to star in a movie that was intentionally cheesy, paid no attention to mythology whatsoever (though, in fairness to that, neither did this movie), and used techniques that were outdated when released. Not that they weren't amusing, but they hold nothing to the 2010 version.

So here comes a remake, one with excellent special effects, starring actors like Sam Worthington and Liam Neeson, that is far darker, and was not made to be laughable. Scene after scene, the battles carry parts of the story of Persues, a demi-god (half god half man), the son of Zeus. Basically people are tired of the gods, the gods get mad, Zues let's several do what they want, including titans and releasing other monsters (Release the Kraken!). Here we have a very real looking snake-Medusa, Pegasus (flying horse), the kraken of course, and a showdown with Hades himself. And for the guys there are two very hot women involved as well.

All in all, it was a very good sort of pre-summer blockbuster movie (that, as of August 15th, way better than any of the summer movies released), and has made enough money to warrant Clash Of The Titans II in 2012. So don't pay attention to the die-hard fans of the original, they are holding onto a movie so much that they do no allow themselves to enjoy it's far superior remake.

""Clash Of The Titans"" is a splendid remake of a very silly but fun film. Because, let's be honest, as enjoyable as the original was, it was never a classic - not even at the time of it's release (which I remember very clearly). The original was a giant cheese football of a movie and this film is also a giant cheese football of a movie; the thing that they both have in common is that they're both completely enjoyable, largely because neither one takes itself very seriously at all.

Like most of the best remakes, ""Clash Of The Titans"" reworks the concept of it's progenitor in order to go somewhere a little bit different. This film is a little darker than the original and, in a suitably Ouroborosian twist, has clearly been influenced by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-of-War-Collection/dp/B002NN7AKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God of War: Collection</a>&nbsp;(an excellent PS2 game which was itself very clearly influenced by the original ""Clash Of The Titans"" - to the point that Harry Hamlin, the actor who played the original Perseus, voiced a character in ""God Of War 2""). But while this film may favour a slightly darker tone, director Louis Leterrier  (who also made the fiendishly enjoyable&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Incredible-Hulk-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001DHXT20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Incredible Hulk (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;with Ed Norton) knows what made the original work and, CGI effects aside, keeps this film very much in the style of camp eighties fantasy movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krull/dp/B000056WR3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krull</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beastmaster/dp/B00005Q4D7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beastmaster</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Conan-the-Barbarian-Collector-s-Edition/dp/0783241895/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Conan the Barbarian - Collector's Edition</a>&nbsp;whilst throwing in some very subversive humour and the odd nod to the original (the brief cameo from Bubo, the rather naff clockwork Owl from the original, had me in fits of laughter, largely due to the way it was played).

Personally, I think ""Clash Of The Titans"" stands head and shoulders over most of the bilge that has filled our cinemas lately. Sam Worthington makes a doggedly rugged Perseus; the rest of the cast (including Mads Mikkelsen, Liam Cunningham, Vincent Regan, Polly Walker and the gorgeous Gemma Arterton) all do a cracking job and clearly have fun doing it; Liam Neeson wanders around in a silly beard and armour; Ralph Fiennes throws in a combination impersonation of Terence Stamp in ""Superman 2"", Nicol Williamson in ""Excalibur"" and Richard Harris in ""Gladiator"" and the film as a whole is generally just a good, all-round, old-fashioned fantasy romp which doesn't take itself at all seriously and is over in under two hours.

Frankly I really have no idea why this remake engendered so much hatred at the time of it's release and I genuinely don't know what's going on with audiences these days. They shower praise on simplistic, portentous drek such as ""Avatar"" like it's a rediscovered Tolstoy novel, yet they can't enjoy a good, old-fashioned fantasy flick which plays fast and loose with Greek mythology (in a deeply amusing manner) and which is merely the latest in a long line of films in which men in sandals and silly beards kick seven shades of what-the-horse-drops out of animated monsters.

Yes, this one is all about the CGI, and that's what I liked about it. There was little pretense of creating a dramatic masterpiece, and much focus on action and thrills, both of which were delivered well, aided by an excellent score. The film starts somewhat slowly but soon ramps up and moves along nicely, and as a simple piece of entertainment I enjoyed it.

COTT doesn't hew very closely to the real Greek myths, but so what. Neither did the original, and I found this version much less hokey and much more enjoyable. Fiennes and Neeson add some dramatic weight to the proceedings (if not overly much), and Worthington contributes his two sides: dogged determination beset by underlying fear and uncertainty, and the curious puppy on the way to doggedness. Which is perfect, as we wouldn't want too much real acting to remind us how ridiculous this whole exercise is.

The effects are exemplary, which is the key to all the fun, and the sound effects and Djawadi's crackling score complete the visceral thrills. There are some fine action scenes, especially in Medusa's cave and the final Kraken battle, and the almost flawless blu-ray transfer does them justice. This was just plain fun to watch on a good set-up; crank the volume on your surround sound and prepare to be floored by good old goofy b-movie intensity. With an a-movie budget.

4031844,1,B002ZG9788,"The original l981 production of ""Clash of the Titans"" was a wonderful crowd-pleaser that should never have been remade.
It was cast with beautiful and talented performers, sparkled with terrific monsters from the genius hands of Ray Harryhausen, and a brisk, fast-moving story that kept the action zooming along--and yes, the Kraken monster, was a terrific nightmare.
Switch to the year 2010 where nearly every movie playing at the multi-plex are atrocious remakes (i.e, ""Nightmare on Elm Street""), lousy sequels or prequels. This latest reboot of ""Clash of the Titans"" is a perfect example.
Instead of the adorable Harry Hamlin, who wore only a skimpy loincloth, we have a buzz-cut Sam Worthington who looks like a wimp from the year 2010.  He wears the same neck-to-knee costume throughout when the role screams for a powerful, muscular hero, like Stone Cold Steve Austin or Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. His modern buzz cutis the same one he sported in ""Avatar. The story moves like crude oil and by the time we FINALLY see the Kraken, we've already been bored to death.

We can't blame Sam Worthington for trying to bring life to his boring role. The director just crammed each frame with deafening noise and music. When will these hack movie-makers realize that if you're going to remake a swords-and-sandals epic, fans want to see as much beef and muscle as possible and try making something fresh and original. The tens of millions of dollars that was poured into his ""reboot"" could easily have been spent in creating a brand new classic that could turn out endless sequels--like the Hercules movies made in the l960s by that spectacular legend of male beauty--Steve Reeves!",1281484800,2,1678,4.967971530249111

I expected a storyline similar to the 1981 original, which followed the mythology fairly closely, replacing the Ray Harryhausen stop-action characters with updated CGI.  Instead I was presented with this mess:  an incoherent script that mangled the mythology, truly bad performances  from well-respected actors, and absolutely ho-hum effects, not to mention the bizarre scenery--since when is there a vast desert in Greece?  I admit that the 1981 original was really cheesy and campy but it was FUN.  The people responsible for this travesty sucked all the joy out of what could have been a great summer movie, turning it into what appears to be an Army recruiting film.

Speaking of which, what was up with Sam Worthington's anachronistic look in this film: a buzz cut and an Army green t-shirt with a pleated skirt?  (At least it wasn't camo.)  Since every other man in the film had long hair and wore (mostly) white, I can only assume it was to keep him from fading into the background.  It seems clear that at least the costuming department realized that he has neither the look nor the acting chops to carry a movie, even a summer popcorn one, and decided to help him by making him look like a time traveling escapee from ROTC class at an all-girls school.

Now we come to Ralph Fiennes, whose entries as Hades forcibly reminded me of Pigpen from the Peanuts comics.  His accent was odd and unpredictable and he chewed scenery like he hadn't had a good meal in weeks.  (If he wants to play a villain, he should stick to Voldemort where he can at least keep his normal British accent.)  And Liam Neeson playing a hippie Zeus, sometimes masquerading as Obi Wan Kenobi...what was that all about?  Where were the lightning bolts...the arrogance..the absolute power?  Why weren't these actors and the director and the scriptwriters forced to read the mythology behind this story before making this film?  Why wasn't the Kraken released on them?

There is much more (all bad) I could say about this movie, from the filmmakers' ""borrowing"" of iconic images from much better films to the dialogue which would have been more appropriate for Rambo, but as my momma always said, ""No point in beating a dead horse.""

I've been waiting to Clash of Titans for a long time now; ever since I saw the amazing trailer I couldn't wait. Recently, it came out on PPV so I ordered it of course. Seeing that it starred Sam Worthington (Avatar) and Liam Neeson (Batman Begins), I figured I was in for an awesome movie that I'd watch a few times over.

Boy was I wrong.

Spoilers herein:

The main problem that I had with the movie is that it moved too fast. Now, being 2 hrs long, you'd think that would leave enough time for character development and other things the director looked over. Guess not. The main character, named Perseus, has so few lines I was startled; you don't get to hear much from him and sadly the only lines he has are rather cringe-worthy and just downright cheesy.

The movie stops every 40 minutes to have him deliver some rallying speech to the people he's taken with him to kill the Medusa/Kraken/Hades and that was rather annoying; considering the ""speech"" is about twenty words or so. I didn't feel inspired like I usually would at that kind of point in a movie.

Not to mention in about 10 minutes all the people he's taken with him die. I was so disturbed at that point I nearly turned it over. One death after the other. I couldn't really be sad about them dying because the movie didn't even let you get to know them, but I kept wondering who the hell wrote the script, who decided it was a good idea to just kill off everyone.

Oh, but there's one more person alive! Perseus makes his way out of the place with Medusa's head to find his love standing there! But all of a sudden a bad man comes and kills her.

Damn.

Clearly not phased at all (seriously look at Worthington's face, it's absolute stone) he gets up and Pegasus comes to take him off into the sunset.

Well.

The last bit is just downright disenchanting; all Perseus does is point the Medusa's head at the Kraken and it's gone. Talk about anti-climatic. Not to mention that he didn't even kill Hades, only sent him to the Underworld. Pointless.

The acting is bad. Sam Worthington's voice is flat and Liam Neeson doesn't deliver like I know he can. They both don't fit the roles. The guy who played Draco was okay, I guess. Otherwise the emotionless voices are terrible and a real throw-off especially during certain scenes.

The good things in this movie:

CGI is spectacular. This is definitely a movie made for 3D. The flying demon things are very fluid and the scorpions are cool looking as well as the Kraken. The Djinn were fantastic and I have to say the one they took with them was my favorite character (who they killed off as well).

Pegasus was a treat to look at and when Hades comes and the darkness moves around him like big black wings it will take your breath away.

The action scenes are nice and long but aren't boring. The violence is kept to a minimum and most of it is just acrobatics and finesse (check out the backwards flips!).

Visually, the movie is astounding; but the terrible acting as well as the too-fast pace will make it a one-time viewing.",1281225600,3,3103,4.406304728546409

I mentioned in my Terminator Salvation review that there was something special about this guy and this remake of Clash of the Titans should solidify that! This is saying a lot considering how short on character development this film is. Imagine if a lousy actor played Perseus? This would've been a complete bomb.

Clash of the Titans is an adrenaline rush! Fans of the original should love this. It follows the myth of Perseus and the Gods of Olympus with some new twists along the way. The short of it is simple. Perseus (Worthington) is the son of Zeus (Neeson)and as the last remaining demi-god the city of Argos looks to him to save them. Feuled with rage against Hades (Fiennes) for killing his earthly adopted parents, Perseus takes up the quest to stop the revenge of the gods. The task, capture the head of Medusa, kill the Kraken and send Hades back to the underworld! Sounds like fun? It is! A complete romp and action fest.

The movie does fail on one level, and it is an important one: character development. The storyline is wonderful and the great actors in this film do much with little. If only they would have spent 15 extra minutes on the band of soldiers and the royal family of Argos, we might have found a little more emotional investment. You just don't care when people start dying and that is never good.

All in all, this movie still packs a wallop and is totally enjoyable! Even with it's flaws, this movie is pure entertainment and a wonderful remake of a classic!

I see negative reviews of remakes based alone on the feeling that some movies are sacred and should never be messed with. I say if you can take a classic and make it even better, then by all means have at it. This 2010 version of Clash of the Titans fails at making the 1981 version better and maybe was worth looking at only because of its cool CGI effects.

I'd have been completely satisfied if fledgling Director Louis Leterrier took the 1981 original story word for word and simply re-did it with updated FX. While he did indeed pay homage to the 1981 version in many respects, it seems he got lost more in creating cool looking FX and abandoning the perfect story flow that the original had. Adding certain aspects to the story could have been interesting if it all made sense, but for me it just didn't make sense and seemed to jump all over the place.

And then there was the acting, or should I say lack thereof. It didn't seem to me that Sam Worthington who played Perseus or Liam Neeson who played Zeus took their roles seriously at all. They came across as two A-listers making cameos versus lead actors giving A-list performances. This combined with the uneven storytelling really took a lot out of the movie for me.

I was never even a fan of Greek Mythology until seeing the original Clash back in the 80s. After that movie I not only became interested in Greek Mythology, I felt I now actually knew something about it...like I just had a very clear and concise lesson in it.

This movie wasn't the love story of the original, and for that i am greatful. I hate love stories, and this is a guy flick with swords and no love story was needed

the scenery and special effects are fabulous. the action wasn't always there in your face, but there was enough. you do need time for breathing in between battles.

The story was as strong as any other. Mother compares her beautful daughter to a goddess and curses the town. the reluctent hero has to find a way to save it. first by finding the evil witches that eat human flesh to find out you have to find Medusa who will turn any male to stone in order to kill the Kracken.

ok, so it isn't the STRONGEST of stories, but it is there and the sword play (which is what i wanted to begin with) was pleanty.

4032019,3,B002ZG9788,"A long time ago there were big, chaotic, uncontrollable gods, the Titans, who ruled the Earth and gave birth to new gods who destroyed them and created man, in order to gain power from their worship.  But men, being men, resented the arbitrary whims of the gods and it was inevitable they'd fight back.  Hades, the god of the underworld, hit upon a plan to bring fear into the hearts of men so they'd worship again.  He'd release the Kraken, a giant sea monster, and destroy a city, but at the same time gain enough power to overpower Zeus, the king of the gods.  It turned out, though, that a forgotten and resentful son of Zeus happened to be hanging around and had a motive and enough pluck to fight back.

While sacrificing story to CGI, this update of the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clash-of-the-Titans/dp/B002ZD3V10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clash of the Titans</a>&nbsp;manages to be entertaining enough for a popcorn family night, but not enough to come anywhere near the inventiveness and excitement of the original. Sure the original had its kitchy moments - with celebrities playing the preening gods - but it felt fresh.  I remember begging to see it as a kid when it first came out and wanting to go back right away - I even had the board game based on the movie.  This one, by contrast, feels highly derivative and only adds to the original an intensity that detracts from the characters and computer generated effects that are only partially convincing.  In the original the effects weren't convincing either, but they were clever and inventive and it felt like an illusion, it gave the feeling of a story being told, rather than a dream pretending to be real.

The opening sequence, that tells the story of the gods against the backdrop of the constellations, was my favorite part of the film.  After that, the portrayal of the gods by Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades, who both brought the required gravitas to the mix; Jason Flemyng as Calibos and Mads Michelson as Draco were also top notch, and managed to import feeling and plausibility into some implausible and over the top hokey dialogue.  Sam Worthington, unfortunately, didn't convince me as Perseus, especially given a performance that was even more wooden and less nuanced than his performance in Avatar, where at least it seemed to fit the situation.

The action is far too busy, for the most part; too much was going on during a fight scene to have much more than a sense of chaos mixed with awe and tension, when what is needed and was sorely lacking here is a stronger sense of identification with who is being attacked by whom and what is at stake in every moment of the battle scenes.  Still, on the whole, I have to say that while I wasn't overwhelmed and on the edge of my seat I was enjoying it.  My wife and kids, who watched it with me, seemed to have fun as well, and afterwards gave it a tentative thumbs up: ""yeah, that was okay, Dad.""  If you don't go into it expecting much, you won't be disappointed and may even enjoy it.  If you do, check out the original, which is much more fun.",1280448000,,3616,4.970149253731344

The detail of the pegasus (even though they came from the beheading of Medusa...) was amazing, the soundtrack was pretty good as well.
Ironically enough I had watched a few episodes of ROME just hours before, and when I saw the costuming in this movie, I found how terribly artificial and inaccurate it was.  If you're going to spend that much money on special effects, you might as well do a good job on the wardrobe.
What the hell was Io doing in this movie?  Where's Athena?  And all the stuff Perseus gets from Hermes?  As soon as the inaccuracies in the mythologies started piling up, I was very distracted.  I couldn't get into it.  I really, really wanted Io to be gone, but she kept on appearing like a bad penny.  I wanted the grey-eyed goddess!
And the Djinn?  Isn't that from middle eastern mythology?  And Djinn were mischievous Genies.  Where did they get the idea for their character design?!  What were they smoking when they decided to put them in this movie?

This version of Clash of the Titans is fast-paced mind-candy that sacrifices story-telling and doesn't keep faith with the audience.  After killing off one of my family's favorite characters, my children started grumbling that the movie should get one star.  The show then shamelessly tries to win back the audience by bringing characters into the finale who could not have made it there, even using the most tortured plot devices in the director's universe.  It's bad enough that you find yourself mentally popping out of the story to ask, ""how'd they get there?""

The acting is generally pretty wooden, especially for the male lead. Additionally, despite the director's attempt to make Andromeda sympathetic, I found myself not caring if she got eaten by the Kraken.  The actress needed some screaming lessons from some of the horror movie queens from the 1980's.  Perhaps Jamie Lee Curtis could find a job as a screaming coach if the yogurt thing doesn't work out for her.  Alexandra Davalos seemed to just hang there limply waiting to be eaten.  Some first class screaming and squirming might have helped, in a sick and twisted way, to develop some character sympathy.  Otherwise, one is simply left with images of Pegasus rapidly navigating around various Kraken appendages.

Ralph Fiennes simply rocks as the bad guy, Hades. Without him and Calibos, the movie would not have worked at all.

Did I mention that the CGI is really cool and the way in which the actors interact with it is exceptional?

Costumes were unimaginative and boring and belonged to a lot of different eras, but not the time period the movie covers. Danae was Acrisius's daughter and not his wife and she welcomed Zeus because she loved him. He appeared as a shower of gold and not an eagle wearing her father's, or in this case husband's, face and form. Too much like Uther Pendragon and Ygraine. Stick to the time period, people.

The armor the gods' wore and the rest of the gods, other than Hermes, Zeus and Hades, standing around and looking blurry and ethereal was a waste of talent and film. The costumes were completely wrong for the time period -- again. At least they got the sandals right.

The CGI, while dazzling, was a one note wonder. The Stygian witches, flying demons and Kraken all had the same basic facial and skull structure. I guess it's too difficult to actually create something new and interesting to breathe life into the more realistic and innovative claymation that Ray Harryhausen used in 1981. Sorry, geeks, not cutting it. Go back to school. What's with the djinn? They belong in the Middle East in a very different century, like during the time of Solomon, which is a few thousand years after Perseus. Pegasus in black and with really lame wings, not funny and not interesting. Medusa as a still beautiful woman with snakes for hair who goes all comic book villain when she turns men to stone, not even worth laughing about.

Alexa Davalos as Andromeda was horrid casting. She would have been better as Io and Io, who was much prettier and had that fragile, ethereal beauty, would have been better as Andromeda. Even Alexa's handmaiden was prettier. Definitely, not the kind of girl a demi-god would risk his life saving, obviously, since he ended up with Io. Once again, the mythology was completely wrong since Perseus marries Andromeda and becomes king.

What is all boils down to is that the original version in 1981 was better all around: costumes, acting, closer to the mythology, creatures and story line. For all its flash and CGI and martial effects, this one falls far down the scale of entertainment and should have been a direct to DVD release. The guys in the CGI department must have been on drugs or just too tired from doing a better movie to get it right and be completely original. Tell the burn-outs it's time to find a new job or go back to comic books.

Movie Review:Ever since I saw the original in theaters I have waited for this remake just for the special effects and the effects in the movie are amazing. The biggest issue I have with this movie is that it abandons all depth of story development for longer, bigger action sequences. The special effects were outstanding but the lack of journey and story left it feeling hollow and dull like just another 'polished' hollywood big budget movie I'm supposed to be wowed by and simply like. Perseus was a reluctant hero who was pulled away from his life and meant to die. This perseus is a little too driven and the underdevelopment of story between his adoptive family and perseus did NOTHING to create sympathy when they died. Even perseus didn't seem to really be haunted by their deaths. He was just angry, nothing else. There was no sense of travel either. It was all just montages of great looking locals that rushed us to the next action sequence. No sense of travel, danger or distance is to be felt. The biggest let down of all for me was the entire sequence in medusa's lair. This, as a kid, was the pinnacle of the movie for me. Yet this remake rushes through it so fast if you blink twice you'll miss most of it. There was NO suspense, NO build up, NO tension, perseus didn't even have to out-wit medusa as he did in the original. He just jumps blindly and manages to get the job done. It was an incredible let down. He didn't have to a whole lot of to do thinking in this movie. He just either has it handed to him or, after most/all of his soldiers die, manages to suddenly do what he should have done at that start of the fight. Perseus didn't even have to catch and tame Pegasus. It just shows up and lets him ride. The original had perseus thinking out every situation he was in and outwitting the baddies and the gods. It was a journey of life or death not one of rushing to the next sequence.

It seems as though the makers of this movie felt they had to do the whole thing BIGGER and GRANDER but their focus on that left all of what made this movie fun to watch out. Hollywood seems to have moved in that direction now, little or no real story anymore. Look back to the older movies and they had a better balance of story and action. This is what I call an, 'Independence day' movie. It's all special effects, fluff and hollywood polish that we are simply supposed to be wowed by but not pay attention too. (Independence day was a horrible movie with little story, full of plot holes. it is the perfect example of movie garbage, in my opinion). I have to agree with a poster here who said it would have been better to simply take the original and `special edition' it like star wars. That indeed would have been preferable to this remake.

Sam Worthington, hot on the heels of the success of Avatar, stars as the demigod Perseus, whose father Zeus (Liam Neeson) has grown disillusioned and unhappy with how the humans worship the Gods of Olympus.  When Zeus' evil brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) plans on unleashing all hell upon the planet, Perseus leads a trek to stop him, before beautiful Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) is sacrificed.  The Clash of the Titans remake features the familiar creatures from the original film: Medusa, giant scorpions, harpies, and of course, the Kraken (Bubo is here too in a throwaway cameo).  However, in re-creating a modern update, the filmmakers forgot one vital thing in the process: making it fun to watch.  While there is a cavalcade of action and PG-13 rated violence, this new Clash of the Titans lacks any of the fun elements or charm of its predecessor.  The original film, while cheesy, campy, and oh so dated now, still has a degree of charm to it regardless because it's just plain fun to watch and easy to enjoy.  Here, the story and action are so mindless and boring that it's just hard to keep paying attention.  Acting-wise Worthington is solid, as are Gemma Arterton and Mads Mikkelsen as his allies on his journey, but no one else makes any sort of lasting impression.  The CGI effects are a mix of good and surprisingly sub-par, yet somehow, Perseus' battle with Medusa is worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, this new take on Clash of the Titans may be worthwhile for younger viewers who have no knowledge of the original film, but for the rest of us who grew up with the original Ray Harryhausen-effects featured film, it'd be for the best to just disregard this remake.",1280188800,2,1902,4.7889908256880735
4032136,5,B002ZG9788,"Comparisons with the 1981 original are inevitable. I see this new version of the Clash of the Titans as more of a reimagining of the story than a remake of the original. This leaves us with two completely different stories that are each outstanding in their own right. Although the story is pretty straight forward it is told as an epic quest that the demigod Perseus experiences as he wrestles with his identity while battling fierce giant scorpions, the three witches, the Gorgon, Medusa, and the condemned Calibos culminating in a final showdown with the giant and terrifying Kraken, mythic sea creature set loose by the gods to destroy the city of Argos and the beautiful Andromeda who is being sacrificed to assuage the wrath of the gods. The motive for this epic quest is that the humans have rebelled against the gods and after killing Perseus' earthly family Hades has used the human rebellion as a means to defeat his brother Zeus to become King of the gods but he must also contend with a vengeful Perseus.

Liam Neeson was an excellent choice as Zeus with his booming voice and commanding presence and Ralph Fiennes does a spectacular job as the deliciously evil Hades, king of the Underworld. Sam Worthington also does an excellent job as the hero Perseus whom he portrays as a smoldering angry warrior forced into circumstances beyond his control as he comes to terms with who he is. The special effects of the movie are equally spectacular and top notch and as a lover of giant monsters this version of the behemoth Kraken of the deep is worth the price of admission.

Also, who would have thought that Harry Hamlin's performance would be hands down the greater Perseus?

First of all, the story is not too bad - but the underdevelopment of the characters is deplorable.  There are even a few members of the supporting cast that could have been wonderful.  But no.  The never had the chance to develop themselves, and then they died so suddenly and pointlessly that you pretty well forgot they had been there.  Sam Worthington displayed some of the worst acting I have ever witnessed.  At no time did you believe him in the role, and at no point do you even remotely pity him.  The gods were a joke.  Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are amazing actors, but even they came across as wooden and ineffective in this film.

Medusa was horribly rendered - she's supposed to be horrific people!  She was nothing short of a bad joke, and the Kraken looked like a sea cucumber with teeth.  The only thing remotely improved over the old version was Pegasus.

As a Christian and a classical scholar I was deeply offended by this treatment of the Greek deities especially as it was clear to me the director had turned this story into a piece of atheist propaganda.  Accordingly this is the first film I walked out on in thirty years.  If you love God, Greek  Mythology, or the first film, avoid this film like the plague.

my only gripe is the tendency to try to 'overpack' the action scenes, much like the transformer movies, theres just too much going on, im just a mere mortal, i can only comprehend so much visually. i end up knowing that something took place, what exactly, i couldn't tell you. why would you spend so much time and effort to produce a blurry, mediocre action sequence? i know somebody hit somebody with a sword, or something, but for zues'sake let me see it.",1280188800,2,740,4.448529411764706
4032241,3,B002ZG9788,"""I went to this film, because I wanted to be entertained, and I was.""
""Why go to movies to nit-pick?  It just wants to be entertaining.""
""Why take a film like this so seriously?  It was just trying to entertaining.""

These above quotes are things you will read all over websites.  They are the lowest common denominator of cop-out quotes defending a film that will be forgotten long before it even hits home video.  EVERY MOVIE'S GOAL IS TO ENTERTAIN.  DUH!  What movie wasn't trying to be entertaing?  Please find me this film that specifically wanted to not entertain.  I would like to see it.  JEEEEZ.

Anyway, the new REMAKE of Clash of the Titans is pretty much one of the few films I've seen that truly lives up to the title remake.  It's just as cheesy as the original Clash.  The acting just as stilted to over-the-top.  And the special effects are the real star.  Sure, the original Clash(a childhood favorite of mine) was silly and cheesy, but guess what, so is the remake.  It's got the same stupid cornball Greek mythology and bland characters.  The original film had the benefit of many well regarded theatre actors slumming it in small parts of Greek gods, so it had an advantage of over the top fun acting.

I'm not sure if the special effects are better in this version.  They're more modern, but not really any more convincing.  Design-wise they're fun to look at and cool, but I never really thought I was watching actual characters doing battle or interacting with characters of flesh and blood, but rather watching live actors duke it out with special effects.  So, on that level it's the same as the original.  Though, with the exception of the Kraken, I thought Harryhausen's designs were a bit cooler.

There's no real drama or even story to this film.  None of the characters really have an arch or a conflict of any interest.  Seriously, they don't.  It's all very slight and unassuming.  And the heroic acting that follows from Sam Worthington is the same.  He's fine in the film.  Though, a dash of Hamlin's Perseus' charm would've gone a long way.

Liam Neeson and Ralphe Fiennes showing up to even read the phone book would be more than enough with these type of stupid movies, so they can't be fouled for their particiaption in this film.  They seem to be having fun and they're both very effective in their respective and totally silly roles.

So, basically this film has a thin plot to hang special effects sequences on.  It's retains most the elements of story from the original with minor changes that don't really ""change"" the point of the film or where it's going.  I really had hoped this would've been better.  I wanted to like it more on a real cinematic level, and not on the guilty pleasure cheese level of Michael Bay's original Transformers.  I wanted this thing to be Jaws, Star Wars, or even Speed, but it's just time diverting, undemanding and curiously entertaining.  It's no classic.  I garuntee(though I could be wrong) it will be forgotten by most before next year.

I appreciate the work and skill that took to put this thing together.  I'm sure it will make a ton of money.  I'm sure the CGI will be award worthy.  But who cares?  Big box office and 'kewl' special effects don't really mean much anymore.  Everything is a hit and everything has 'kewl' special effects.  So, when annoying peeps who utter with disdainn things like, ""why take a film that just wants to entertain so seriously and nit-pick"", just reply back, ""BECAUSE I WASN'T ENTERTAINED, and my tastes have grown tired of the same thing every summer and want more from my entertainment.""  That's all.

I'm not bashing the film.  It's worth a rent.  It's worth a buy if you admire the designers behind the CGI special effects.  I found the thing entertaining, but not consuming.  It's really the same thing with the original.  I imagine if I was six and saw this thing for the first time I would be enthralled, and then fifteen years or so later laugh at how silly the thing I loved ultimately is.  SO, this remake gets three stars for having cool monsters, cheesy but fun premise that made me smile, and bringing my inner six year old out to play.  Now it's time to put the inner-kiddie to bed so I can watch a new Atom Egoyan film.

PS: It's a Warner Blu Ray so the picture and sound is amazing, better than the theater.  The special features are more sparse than I would have expected, but it mostly deals with special effects and in much depth.  THere's a throw away puff piece about new action hero Sam Worthington that's just promotional, but if you're a fan of him, then you'll love it.  That's it.  No commentary unfortunately, that's my favorite special feature. I would've also liked a comparison piece about this and the original, kind of like they did on the remake of House on Haunted Hills DVD.

4032244,1,B002ZG9788,"As we all know this is a remake of the original film of the same name. When that's the case, comparisons are always made. So first and foremost the question that comes to mind is does this film hold a candle to the original, was it done well enough that it's existence is warranted? The answer? Sorry, I don't have one just yet. We'll have to figure this out together. What I do know, is that there's something wrong with this film that's preventing it from being what it could be.

Despite the rumblings of negative initial reviews, I went into this one wanting all the original had to offer, (because really, if you watch the original with a critic's eye, it's got a lot of it's own flaws and plot holes) an enjoyable time. The problem here is that even though I went into it without the negative baggage, I still went into it biased. I wanted to like this movie. But the difference here is the original piece has a few qualities the modern one does not: a sense of mysticism, charm, an epic other timely feel, and people who stand by what they believe. Without these pieces of the puzzle this film feel soulless, and in the end we don't care about what's happening because we don't care about the people.

Several points of confusion: What do the gods want? What do the people want? I know the gods need the prayers of the people to remain powerful, and I know the people want to either a) survive or b) be god-free. The problem is, the writer spends the entire time telling this to us, by repeated bashing us over the head with myriad exposure to the phrase ""I do this as a man"" from Perseus, or Zeus or Hades uttering they need the prayers to remain strong. What the writer and the actors don't do is reveal to us through their actions this is what they feel, or explore variety using other dialogue the conflicts within the characters themselves. In fact they all come across as so wishy-washy that there are several points of self-contradictoring actions. Why do the gods help Perseus defy them? Why is Perseus told to accept the gifts from the gods when they are on a mission to defy the gods? And why are the other men in such disbelief when Perseus does not want to use these items for that reason? I never really got a sense for why any of these things were the way the were. There's no cohesiveness at all to the characters or the plot, and due to poor writing you either don't know why they do what they do (there aren't any motives revealed) or you are only TOLD a very basic why they're doing what they're doing. There's no depth. In this film, and I know in old mythology it usually is the case, but this makes him uninteresting, Zeus is a dick and shows no real care for the humans what so ever, even though he's been stated as having loved man too much, but for some reason he cares about Perseus, his son. I understand this should be a simple fill in the blank conjecture: he's his son, that's why he cares. But none of his other actions within the film show that this is a possibility, that he can care for anyone other than himself. He's just an outright dick. There's an instance in the film during the exploration of the Calibos origin, where Zeus goes to Earth and sleeps with Calibos' wife, impregnating her because Calibos waged a war against the gods. ... Seriously, you are a god who wields lightning like a javelin and the best you can come up with for revenge is something petty like knocking up his wife? So not only is he a dick, but he's petty too. Where as in the original, he is hesitant about his decisions to attack humans and it is only because of the politics of 'the gods' that he ultimately decides to do what he does, and he is shown, in the original, genuinely concerned for Perseus numerous times, asking the aid of other gods in private for tools they can give Perseus to succeed.

Also, there's no sense of urgency in between the action scenes. It really feels like they're just clipping along, hitting all their spots and that's that. Not once do I feel like the characters feel there's any importance to what their doing. Perseus, not once does anything for anybody other than himself. He's not on this mission for the one he loves, like in the original, but for revenge. And I know there are great films built around revenge like ""Oldboy"" and ""Batman Begins"" but in those films the characters are passionately seeking revenge, in this one Perseus just gets upset about Hades killing his parents and then says he's not a demi-god, then says ""If I do this, I do it as a man."" Seriously, this seems to happen in between every fight seen. And here in I think I discovered a cause for disconnect: Sam Worthington. I hear he's a nice guy, but honestly he's truly a case of 'the right look, but just not right for the role.' I want to like him, and he looks the part, but he just never really has me believing anything he does. He really really mugs his emotions. I know there's the whole argument that if you simply look a certain feeling on camera the audience will project whatever they think you're feeling onto you. That might be true but it can't feel forced or needs to feel natural, and there needs to be variety to help create a sense of depth. Just because we believe the first reaction doesn't mean we'll believe that same reaction every time. Mr. Worthington just hasn't shown me he has variety or depth yet.

Another problem the film has is that thematically, it's a mess. What do you take away from this film? Fate is not certain? Humans create their own fate? Humans don't need the gods? None of the above holds true do to the actions of the characters and the story. Fate is not certain: but Perseus is told he was born to do a certain thing in the film. And he does just that. Scratch that one. Humans create their own fate: Okay, so he's told he dies but doesn't. Okay, but then he still does what he's fated to do. So that one is half wrong half right, meaning it's pointless. Humans don't need gods: But he needs the gifts of the gods to succeed. So that one's gone too. Essentially you walk away with no morale or theme, no message, everything you watched was unimportant. I know there are movies that people enjoy with no theme or morale compass to learn of, but none of those movies literally present a morale in the film and then contradicts it, or they're so bad they're funny. This one is not the later.

The ultimate problem is that this movie relies heavily on audiences having seen the original and simply hitting all the marks of the original, essentially going ""See, look at all the things that look better now that we've got this technology."" And it really does this without making the film anything special that stands out from the original, other than the special effects. When that's the case, it may have well not been made at all. Look at the first Star Wars re-release with added footage. One phrase: CGI Jabba.

Some minor things, Why did the creative team feel the need to add the Jin? I don't remember those being in the original. It adds nothing to the movie other than being a cheap quick get-out-of-jail- free card for our hero, immediately eliminating any tension possible when there's a danger to him like when they are faced with the giant scorpions, when our hero is poisoned, and when they need transportation. All those problems are solved by this character. When you add something to a film that really doesn't add anything to the story or character depth, there's no point in having it in the first place.

I heard a lot of the problems people had with the film is the decision to show it mostly in 3-D, and while I do have a problem with that aspect of the film, I more-so simply have a problem with 3-D in general. But that's a different discussion.

There are things I did like. Gemma Arterton for one, not really for her portrayal of Io, a fellow demi-god who never appears in the original story, I've just got a crush on her. You can see her again in a similar role, in a movie similar in style, in 'Prince of Persia: Sands of Time.' The design of the world and creatures are nice. But two things I think they should've done: Not shown the Kraken in the trailers. Everyone who's seen the original would've flocked to see this movie for a chance to see what it looked like. I know for marketing reasons they probably wanted to entice newcomers which may have also had an adverse effect since it's only in the movie for like 5 minutes. Probably getting a ""that's it"" response from the newbs. It would've gotten buzz simply from word of mouth from the people who have seen it. They also should've have shown the entire upper body of the Kraken in one shot, not just sections. I mean what we saw was an awesome design, and it's not a case of hiding it to enhance the atmosphere of the situation. In this case showing the awesome entirety of the creature would've been more effective, and would not have taken away from the colossalness of the creature. If anything seeing it's full stature vs the city would've improved that feeling of 'holy crap!'

Going into this film there was a hope of seeing a great action movie with awesome fantasy aspects and larger than life epic characters. What is shown is a by the marks re-hash of the original with a few added elements, very few of which add anything that defines this film and makes it stand on it's own two feet. In the end it's nothing more than a Clash of the Titans re-release with added CGI bonuses, making it's creation wholly unneeded, and in this case, unwanted.",1279929600,6,9515,4.410927717700626

4032246,3,B002ZG9788,"Sam Worthington has definitely become an overnight sensation, with Terminator Salvation(not so great, and Avatar(great to most) he has really made a name for himself as a great action guy. Well his acting ability has been foreshadowed by mostly super CGI effects and cardboard dialogue, with the exception of Avatar where he actually did some good acting. In Clash Of The Titans he does a great job, actually to good for the rest of the film which lacks and substance or solid storyline at all. Sure Zeus, Poiseddon, Hates and all the boys are there but they really do nothing more but talk back and forth, and don't really give any great presentations through the film other than Hate's and Zeus making an occasional appearance on earth here and there. Most of the script feels like it was written by a few college kids in drama class, and is spoken as that. The one amazing thing of course that everyone and there brother went to see this movie was for the special effects. Yes they are spectacular but does that make a great film, well no, not really. The giant scorpions, medusa, and the cracken all are very incredible characters and the movie has no lack of action what so ever. However your just left with the idea that you witnessed a little over 90 minutes of I-Candy, a bit like some sort of mythological porn, so to speak. So its not bad, and its not great, if your looking for a CGI show for your giant LCD/LED tv this movie is great for just that, but just a rental, thats about all. Unless you have friends who come over at different times and you want to show the movie off, its noth worth much more. But kudos to Sam Worthington for making what could have been just one big turd into a pile of small ones, he definitely stole the show as far as actors go.

4032327,2,B002ZG9788,"'Clash of The Titans' was one of those movies that came out in the zany 80s. Like most of those movies they were fun to watch, but if you wanted them to be these great epics you had to turn to very crude special effects. With where we are right now in film making we can do almost anything from Dinosaurs, to transforming robots. So, naturally why not take some of these old honky-tonk 80s epics and turn them into something amazing?!

Clash of the Titans was a good choice to give one of these modern day makeovers to. The epic battles with mythical Greek monsters in this day and age would look incredible...and they did. Still, the guys who gave this movie a makeover sort of forgot to finish the job. The movie was lacking extremely of acting talent, character development and story. Now I went to see this movie in the theaters because the action sequences looked great and yes they were. During the softer points in the movie I was flat out bored. The acting was bland, and even though Liam Neason and Ralph Finnes brought all they could to the table and they did a decent job, it still just didn't seem to work. Also the movie while it paced quite well, it just went a little too fast. I thought that the battles with the giant scorpions and Medusa just went way too quickly I completely didn't know there was a fight going on. Don't even get me started on the Kraken battle...I don't even know if there was a battle with the Kraken because I think the movie ended right when it finally showed up on the screen.

A great deal of film appreciators feel that re-making films is a bad idea, I say yes and no, because let's face it do you really think that a kid born after 1990 is going to ask his/her mom or dad to rent the 1981 'Clash of the Titans'? Odds are no, so why not bring some of these movies to the modern day, clean them up add some great effects and there you have it. Still, when you decide that this is a movie you want to re-do make you actually make it better than the original! Not the same and definitely not worse. 'Clash of Titans' is nothing but an epic of failure. Still, I am glad that I did see it and I am glad that the things I expected in the film to be good were and that's why I gave it 2 stars.

4032330,1,B002ZG9788,"If you loved the original Clash of the Titans you will absolutely hate this remake. You'll hate this remake even if you DIDN'T see the original. I've seen B horror movies better than this.

Why? In no particular order...

1. The dialogue is campy. I saw this in the theater (waste of money), and the audience was laughing at parts that weren't meant to be funny, because they couldn't believe this made it out for public viewing.

2. The cheesy comedic relief characters are stereotypical, completely pointless, and stupid. The original didn't need comedic relief characters to keep the audience somewhat entertained because IT WAS AWESOME. (and it had the owl!)

3. There is hardly any resemblence to the Greek mythology- granted, the original wasn't 100% accurate but it didn't stray so far or make up/add so many disparate elements (wooden djinns? really?).

4. When Perseus is riding Pegasus on city streets (when they are using a real horse versus the flying CGI one) the folded wings look like something a highschool student could make at home and attach to a horse. You'd think they'd use some of their special-effects budget to make more than a half-hearted attempt. I guess they used it all up on Hades.

6. Medusa is entirely CGI. Not my biggest gripe about her. In the original she was ugly, just like she is suppose to be according to the mythology. In the remake they even briefly go over the story of Medusa, how she was changed from a beautiful woman to a horribly ugly monster...then they proceed to contradict themselves with her- she has the upper body/face of a playboy bunny (with snake hair albeit), and a snake lower body. Horrific monster? Hardly.

The only two things I liked about this movie was how Hades would appear (don't EVEN get me started on how they decided to throw the original's storyline out concerning him), and the Kraken. That's it.
I wouldn't even really deign to call this a remake- it changes the storyline completely, and the only thing they have in common is the characters' names. I mean c'mon, where's Bobo the owl? Oh yeah, Perseus picks him up out of box, asks what it is, and throws him back in the box.

This was physically painful for me to sit through. I guess Laim Neeson and Ralph Fiennes had to pay some bills, because I can't imagine why else they would agree to be in this POS.",1276992000,9,2335,4.63680387409201
4032461,5,B002ZG9788,"This was an action movie... A FANTASTIC action movie! I went to the cinemas and paid to see this movie several times because it brought Greek mythology to life on the big screen in a way that has NEVER been done before. No, the acting was not Oscar-worthy. I'm sorry folks, but get over it. Not every movie must be an indie masterpiece with riveting acting from unknown foreigners. That's what film festivals are for. Some films are made for the acting, some for the artistic eye, some for the point of jerking tears from sobbing eyes, but some are for pure entertainment.

Luckily, this movie has a good taste of some of those other attributes as well, but with a gnashing, string-heavy, and edgily-strung score by Ramin Djawadi (whose previous works include Iron Man, Prison Break, and others), beautiful filming locations in Scandinavia and the Canary Islands, as well as gritty, epic, action scenes, this movie is a sheer delight as far as action blockbusters go.

There is a reason it made nearly half a billion dollars worldwide. Go see it for yourself. True, not everybody liked what they saw, but if the dislikes outweighed the likes as far as movie viewers go, you would see more of a Ghost Rider dud effect (which garnered just over 200 million worldwide) on the box office numbers, which is clearly not present in this awesome sword and sandals romp.

No, it is not an intelligent Bourne-type thriller, nor is it an Avatar-grade special effects bonanza, but it is convincing and EXTREMELY enjoyable for what it is... a mythological action quest of epic proportions, and a fair and non-condescending re-imagining of the 80's original. I could not ask for anything more from the best mythological epic made in a very long time!",1276905600,11,1736,4.78

When I grew up a bit, like say, in middle school, I knew exactly what I wanted. I wanted a remake of the film that was so cheesy and yet so lovable. Sooo more than a decade later, I finally got my wish-or not.

The remake of Clash is appallingly bad, and not in a cheesy way. It is just bad. Everything about it is worthless. The characters are pointless and have no redeaming qualities, the Gods are completely underutalized. The plot is non-existant and really doesn't make any sense. Andromeda may as well have been written out of the script since her appearance in the film had NO purpose. The CGI is OK but man do I wish for the old Medusa. The list goes on and on. The acting is the only saving grace here. And I'm pretty much talking about Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson. They commanded the screen in their small, pointless roles. Sam Worthington does a good job, but nobody CARES about his character. He comes off as arrogant and unworthy of anything.

There is no soul to this film. It is just bits of action scenes sewn together for entertainment purposes. I was so frustrated and aggravated after the ending because after literally years of hoping and waiting, the final outcome is just plain garbage. Perhaps my expectations were too high but maybe if the creators spent more time on the actual plot and less on trying to make this film 3D, then just maybe it would have turned out decent.

4032463,1,B002ZG9788,"So many things wrong with this movie...let's just start with what it is. It's basically an excuse to see Sam Worthington get dressed up in a Greek-looking costume. There's really nothing more to it than a bunch of well-overused battle scenes and movie cliches cobbled together around short spasms of rock and roll music. The mythology is ludicrously incorrect, including pairing Perseus up with Io, his own ancestor, instead of Andromeda, who might as well not even be in the movie. Heck, I was even rooting for the Kraken to eat her and him, too, dang Perseus. The mumbo-jumbo about ""somebody's got to stand up to the Gods"" is such nonsense as to be absurd, especially considering that Perseus would have died about ten minutes into the movie without Zeus' help. Or, as both he and Hades tell everyone, before that, considering that they provide the oxygen supply. The acting was profoundly awful, too. This is one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.",1276560000,7,964,4.848484848484849
4032464,3,B002ZG9788,"While the special effects of Clash of the Titans were, by all means, spectacular, the lack of story is a portrayal of what Hollywood is creating to entertain the viewers. The viewers, in a sense, are getting what they wanted from this film, intense action sequences with superb special effects. Seeing that violent battle scenes and special effects are what sell, the makers of this movie decided to scrap any story that could have been made to make room for more excessively detailed monsters and environments. This movie and movies like it (2012, Transformers 2, Ninja Assassin, etc.) had potential (excluding Ninja Assassin) to be smart, well told stories that would 'wow' the audience but at the same time, have some substance so that it could be enjoyed by a wider audience. This movie is one of the reasons I wish Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) and many other directors (Guy Ritchie(Lock, Stock, and Two Smokin' Barrels), Martin Scorsese (The Departed)) would never take a break from there work so that the public could continue (or start, depending on the person) to see that films aren't just a means of entertainment, but a form of art.

This doesn't really have anything to do with what I'm reviewing, so. . .
I didn't really like this film. It had potential, the cast was for the most part good, and its based off a story. I mean, how do you screw up story?

The thing I didn't like is how they change the myth of the greek gods to serve this film. Sure the monsters looks cooler in todays technology, but other than that, it's a ""blah"". The Olympians are mostly background fodder with only one other god that has a talking scene. What's up with that?

The original is a lot better storywise, for the sole reason that Perseus has a connection with Andromeda in the first place and not just a meleh meeting. The gods are more involved on the story as well. They were always watching and assiting the hero in his quest. This ""new"" movie made it sounds like the ""war"" makes everyone should be concern, but I don't feel that at all.

And what's up with making Hades always the bad guy? The original movie, Thetis, a sea goddess was the ""bad"" guy but not because she was evil, she's just protecting her own.

This one could've done better but it felt like the makers are just hoping on the special effects to make people see the movie, nothing else! That only works once, on the first viewing, nothing more.",1276387200,5,1197,4.354260089686099

It seems that the bulk of the negative reviews fall into two categories: 1. It wasn't as good as the original. 2. It wasn't true to the Greek legend.

Well,
I didn't see the original.
I know the legend but not in great detail.
I think movies can stand on their own merits.

I'm a fan special effects, especially creatures, and this movie had excellent effects and great creatures -- Medusa, very cool. I'm also a fan of costume dramas, especially the Sword and Sandal genre. The costumes, sets, and atmospherics in general were excellent. The gloomy look and moody score were superb -- not like the bright sunny Greece of real life but quite appropriate for a time of war with the gods. The acting was really good too -- with all those great Brits and Aussies, you can't go wrong. The action was quick and well choreographed.

My only regret was that the story and the dialog could have been richer, snappier, punched up a notch, less predictable, and the characters could have used more personality -- those fine actors could have handled anything.

All in all an enjoyable film.",1276041600,2,1110,4.614213197969543

But instead, they changed things around and came out with a bad script, virtually no character development, and the one thing they did brilliantly - updating the special effects and monsters - they shot in such a haphazard and jerky fashion that you never got a chance to really see it.

A good remake as far as remakes go.

As usual, it had it's pros and cons compared to the original:

Pros - The Medusa Scene IS the best scene in the movie, the action scenes were better, I liked that they changed the end, giving a hint that more's to come. I liked the black pegasus, and that they showed more of them, like he's one of many.

Cons - The scorpions were dull but funny at the same time, the witches were the ugliest, nastiest witches I have ever seen.

One thing I hate, is that the only action we got from the gods were that of Hades and Zues.
I expected to see more action with the gods.
Very disappointed with that.
They're just standing around doing nothing....The trailers lead me to think otherwise...

One thing is for sure Sam has to buff up a bit for the next movie.",1275264000,3,821,4.138364779874214
4032554,2,B002ZG9788,"Indeed, it was quite the misadventure. So I saw Clash of the Titans, with the full knowledge that the movie was likely to be absolutely atrocious in every conceivable way, save perhaps in the special effects department. I am pleased to note that it was indeed thoroughly awful, but amusingly so.

Might as well get the effects concessions out of the way. They were very nice and I did like the degree of creature detail involved, especially on Medusa. She was pretty awesome. I especially liked the degree of sound detailing in her scenes. The Kraken was merely all right in this regard. In case this matters to someone, I saw it in 2D.

As I expected, they took the original myth away into a back room and then beat it senseless. There is a thin plot between all the action/effects scenes and it wouldn't be half bad if the action slowed down a bit so that there could be more than a superfluous plot.

Right, so concerning the bit of plot that was there... It seems strange to say this, but I felt that the cast of supporting characters could have been halved and still have the main players for this particular installment of  the Hero's Journey. The time spent with Perseus's adoptive family was nice and certainly worked as an effective, if somewhat overused, motive for him to go rescue Andromeda from the Kraken. However, the troupe that accompanies Perseus to find a way to kill the kraken could have been reduced to Io and the older soldier (whose name escapes me and the IMDB isn't helping). In any case, the attempts to render all of the barely memorable monster fodder in more than one dimension seemed like an afterthought, something to fill the gap between action scenes. Most of the developmental dialog for Perseus happened around Io and the older gent anyway.

There's an attempt to tack on some angst to Perseus with a somewhat atheist mindset, but it really seems a little silly when one of those deities is a parent. It was absurd to the point of being laughable. Perseus would shout ""I'm NORMAL!!"" and everyone else would kick him or give him a magic sword and say ""Demigod does not equal normal. Now go kill the Kraken."" I thought it was snicker worthy. Although, one has to admit, Sam Worthington does have the legs to look good in a short tunic.

Of the damsel in distress, while the attempt at deeper characterization was noted, it needed more lead in to work better with the story and  make a few of the scenes at the end of the movie have a better impact. She's portrayed as a philanthropist. Nothing particularly interesting, but what can one expect out of an action flick?

One thing that really ticked me off was a tweak with the original myth, but I'll mention it anyway: Hades as the villain instead of Poseidon. It ticks me off to no end, because of all the Olympians Hades was one of the calm, reasonable, less-of-a-jerk deities. Maybe someone wanted to draw parallels to God and the Devil (unlikely) or maybe someone thought that Hades was an awesome villain in the Disney flick Hercules (more likely).

Ironically, the thing that annoyed me the most actually provided the my favorite moments of the film. Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades was quite frankly casting genius. I loved watching them play their characters very well as they futilely try to save the film from an overpowering sense of ""I've seen this before."" In a sea of so-so everything else, it really stood out, enough so that I wished that more time had been spent on Olympus than in the mortal world.

Lest I forget, there is a nod to the original Clash of the Titans. It is hilarious. :D

If one is looking for an action movie with muscly men in short skirts, with bits of humor here and there, you can certainly do worse than this remake... but I'd wait for the rental.",1275091200,3,3786,4.544787077826725
4032555,5,B002ZG9788,"I watched this movie after listening to all the Percy Jackson books.
The movie deserves special mention for its soundtrack.
Am sure the soundtrack will win or atleast get nominated for a Grammy.
Plus the movie itself uses 3D effects naturally instead of artifically like poking you in the face with a sword, etc.
Attention to detail is amazing. For instance the Scorpion slipping on a stone in the narrow path when it ferries its passengers is realistic.
The sad soundtrack during the Medusa encounter was heartbreaking.
Anyone who knows the history of Medusa knows her life is a sad one. The Music Director clearly has done his homework.
Medusa's head changes from beautiful to the freezing is a reflection of the Director's sense of knowledge of history.
The best scene was medusa tries to freeze the Jinn and he laughs as he is not of flesh.

spurts of time, and rather slap dash. The story was very choppy and the acting really mostly awfull.  I remember the 1st C of T as being an adventure/romance with a story, no matter how pat or corny that story was.  And its ok to change stories and essentially recreate the story, but it is definately not ok to to have Sam Worthington as Perseus.  So lets put Mr. Worthington next to Mr. Hamlin and I wouldn't think twice who Andromeda or Io would go to bed with.  Sam Worthington playes a sort of Roman pissed off military type as opposed to a mythological Greek hero and he compares badly as a romantic hero as well. Sam Worthington is essentially playing a angry young man with a buzz haircut.  There is no sense of renewal at the end of the 2nd C of T, even the reimmurgence of Io is just slapped on, no continuity, no meaning.",1273795200,2,1048,4.189054726368159

There are so many, that I think I'll just bunch all of my questions up together at the beginning and get it over with. Why does Perseus have a shaved head when everyone else in the film has the appropriate hairstyle for the time period? Why did they CGI Medusa? Why does Calibos look like he belongs in Wrong Turn rather than this film? Why does Hades walk with a staggered limp and have such a dramatic dry voice and a burnt scalp? Why does Zeus need to wear armor while sitting upon his throne in Olympus? Why did everyone feel the need to engrave abs into their armor? Were they really that bored? I know they didn't have cable or Nintendo back then, but come on! And lastly, why was this film re-made at all? It's a Saturday morning classic B-rate 80's flick and that's the way we like it. It's not a CGI infested Hollywood Blockbuster, and attempting to make it so, was a disappointment.

But who knows - perhaps Clash of the Titans would have made a good huge Hollywood film, had they done it right. If they had stepped away from the cheesiness of the original altogether, and started fresh - maybe we'd have something. Instead, what we are left with is a sorry attempt and what feels like a collaboration between the corny appeal of the classic, breaded with special effects and this goes together about as good as lasagna and cocoa puffs would.

Having never seen the original, my friend leaned over, about 10 minutes in and whispered in my ear, ""Why does this feel like we're watching a bad 70's flick?"" If memory serves, this was right around the time where Zeus' metal armor was ridiculously gleaming and shining at us like something out of a bad rock video. I smiled to myself and informed her, that we essentially were - as the original was released in 1981, and this version was caked with its long since dried-over cheese.

The original is one of my favorite films. It's fantastic. It's a cult classic and is so bad, that is in turn so good; if that makes any sense at all! It's extra jam-packed-filled with B-rate dialogue, B-rate sets and of course, glorious old school stop animated sequences and corny props. Somehow, the giant scorpions looked more convincing in the original.

Both films have almost the exact same story; the only major difference being that the orders of events have been randomly shuffled around to appear in a different sequence. And this new version offers Hades as the lead villain, when Calibos was the one causing havoc for Perseus in the original. He still appears here, but looks nothing like he did previously and is only in the film for a small amount of time.

While I wasn't a fan of the haircut, even though it fits Sam Worthington every bit as Vin Diesel's fits him; Worthington still delivers a great performance as Perseus. He's a gifted actor and is only getting better.

It's also no shocker that Liam Neeson makes for a good Zeus. If I had to picture what God would look like in the form of a man, it would be Neeson all the way. There is something truly majestic about the guy.

Had I not recently seen Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightening Thief, maybe I would not have been so disappointed with the Medusa sequence Clash offers us; but I highly doubt it. In Percy Jackson, Medusa was brilliantly played by Uma Thurman and the CGI snakes that were her hair were astronomically more impressive.

In addition to this, there was far more depth given to Uma's version of the character, throughout a stimulating scene of dialogue exchanged between her and Percy. No such scene is found in the Clash of the Titans and the CGI is weak and tiresome.

The entire flow of Percy Jackson, was better executed and although each scene served primarily to set up the following scene as our hero marched on with his purpose much like Perseus does here; it never felt that way. Clash of the Titans spoon-feeds us one sequence after another like we are a newborn strapped in a highchair. We're not children; we can handle a little more drama. Which of these two films was aimed at kids again?

The one thing Clash of the Titans got almost perfect was its climax. Very awesome CGI during the Kraken's scene. Amazing stuff here. Great water-swooping camera shots, and a lot going on at once and the thing was just great to watch as it emerged from the water to reek havoc.

The only problem with this scene is that it seems like they spent so much money on making the Kraken look sensational, that they had none left to close the film out with. We go from the Kraken to what should have been an even bigger showdown, to the credits.

If you can watch both films and compare them, then great; but if you have to choose between this film and Percy Jackson... I trust you know what to do.",1273795200,2,5178,4.550537634408602

I lasted through the giant crab scene which I felt was a ripped from the film ""Mysterious Island"". I was waiting for Captain Nemo to emerge from the sea. I could not stomach the acting and particularly Sam Worthington's portrayal Perseus. I kept waiting for him to say ""Hey dude.""

4032604,3,B002ZG9788,"Perseus (Sam Worthington) was found by a fisherman in the middle of the sea when he was only a child. Raised by the fisherman, Perseus was treated like a son despite his mysterious beginnings. But when his adoptive family is killed by Hades (Ralph Fiennes) in the midst of the Greek city Argos' war against Zeus (Liam Neeson), Perseus finds out that he's a demigod, the son of Zeus. Rather than joining the gods in their war with the humans, Perseus joins the humans in an effort to find out how destroy Hades' Kraken, a legendary destroyer of cities, and in turn seek revenge for the death of his family.

I'm fairly certain that I'm not the only one who, when this went into production, wondered why they chose to remake a 1981 film rather than creating a movie based on the hugely popular God of War video game series. I guess part of my reticence to this idea has to be my general disinterest in remakes, but at the same time one has to admit that video game movies generally fare worse than remakes as a rule. Then the casting started poring in for this remake/reimagining, and I started to get a bit excited about it. Sam Worthington proved his mettle as the best part of Terminator: Salvation and did a great job in Avatar, and anytime you have Liam Neeson and/ or Ralph Fiennes in a movie, especially together (they're first time on screen together since Schindler's List) you're most likely up for a good time. To fill out the brilliance on screen, Louis Leterrier was set to helm the project having done movies that have ranged from merely good (Transporter, The Incredible Hulk) to transcendent (Unleashed or Danny the Dog). Needless to say I was more than slightly interested to see what this would all lead to.

While you might expect this film to completely re-imagine the film, but rather even down to the special effects the films has a much more old school feel to it. This is both one of the strengths of the movie and a detriment to the movie as well. While it utilizes all of the special effects at it's disposal, it still lumbers like an unweildy beast at times. The mix of CGI with the look of practical effects doesn't look as good as other movies that have come out recently, and other creations don't mix well with the practical creations. Overall, though, Leterrier knows how to work an action sequence, and the action really does work, even if the ending is slightly anticlimactic. The most disappointing aspect of the movie though is the 3-D transfer which doesn't appear to be in 3-D except the very beginning of the movie, other than that the cost of the 3-D surcharge is asking a lot of viewers, and proves just to be nothing more than a cash making gimmick by Warner Bros.

With all of the great actors that were involved in this movie, the acting is strangely subpar. Ralph Fiennes hams it up as god of the underworld Hades as does Jason Flemyng as former King of Argos Arcisius, and Liam Neeson isn't given much to do as uber-god Zeus. Sam Worthington is surprisingly flat as the demigod Perseus. Most of the time Worthington appears to be bored or just not even trying. Of everyone on the cast the most believable actors are Pete Postelthwaite as Perseus adoptive father Spyros, and his demise early on in the movie is truly lamentable, and Gemma Arterton as Io, the ageless beauty who helps lead Perseus to his destiny of defeating the gods.

I'm not saying the movie's horrible, this isn't Transformers 2, but it's also not Avatar either. All in all it's still a fun movie worth a look-see, but it's definitely not the best that the cast and crew could possibly have to offer. I enjoyed myself at the theater for this one (even if I was annoyed by paying the 3-D surcharge for nothing), and I suggest you give it a shot. You might find yourself slightly disappointed, but you'll probably still have fun as well.

4032605,2,B002ZG9788,"There's a whole slew of computer-generated creatures in this remake, but the most stunning visual is Gemma Arterton, a one-time Bond Girl whose eyes glint and puddle up as Io, the muse and demigoddess guide to Perseus (Sam Worthington) in this well-worn tale of Greek mythology. No surprises in this 90-minute quickie, aside from an awful turn as Hades from Ralph Fiennes, who appears to have swallowed a pill of Insta-Queeze, which is quite different from underworld menace.

Perseus, son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), is a terribly grim sort, having lost his family in the war between men and gods. Reluctantly but without mercy, he slays a variety of beasts, chats up Io and eventually wins a showdown inside Medusa's lair with the help of a scorpion shield. Then it's on to the Kraken, which the audience never quite sees in full before it's turned to stone.

Worthington appears headed for a lifetime of cop and soldier-of-fortune roles, while Arterton - with another upcoming starring role in Jerry Bruckheimer's beefcake epic ""Prince of Persia"" - is headed for the A-list. A British accent, toothy grin and hair that looks great thrown into ancient Scrunchies? I smell the second coming of Rachel Weisz.",1272672000,4,1203,4.9504950495049505
4032606,2,B002ZG9788,"I have always been fascinated by legends and myths of ancient Greece the way they were retold from the ancient epic and lyric poems, and I could spend hours counting the liberties taken with the famous legends in the new action adventure Clash of the Titans (2010) but I will only mention few of them. Zeus, the king of gods did not appear seduce the mother of Perseus, the main character of the film, in the form of her husband, Acrisius. Acrisius was the father of Danae, who was predicted to be killed by her son. Frightened Acrisius imprisoned Danae in a bronze chamber open to the sky in the courtyard of his palace. Zeus entered the chamber in the form of golden rain, and from that union Perseus was born. After several generations, Zeus would disguise himself as a husband of another beautiful woman, Alcmene, resulting in birth of the greatest Greek hero, Hercules. The guardian angel of Perseus in the film, the beautiful woman named Io, was according the legend his foremother, from who the greatest heroes of Greece would descend.  Io died long before the birth of Perseus, and simply could not accompany him in his journey.  As a matter of fact, Perseus was on his quest for the head of Medusa Gorgona alone, and two his half-siblings had helped him, the gods Athena and Hermes. Perseus from the legend never was depicted as the rebel against Gods and the fighter for the human rights. The Legend of Perseus is so beautiful and poetic that it deserves to be filmed without deviation and strange changes.  I never understood why every director and screenwriter who decided to make yet another adaptation of the well known legends should add some preposterous changes to them? One more thing - what with the title? The Titans, also known as the elder gods, were the children of Gaea, the Earth goddess and Uranus, the sky god. The Titans ruled the earth before the Olympians with Zeus as their leader overthrew them and banished them to Tartarus, a place deep beneath even the underworld, dark, sunless and gloomy.  There are no titans in the movie and evidently, no clash of the Titans.  And it's been notice by many viewers that the Kraken was not even the monster from Greek mythology but from the Scandinavian. The huge dragon that was sent as the punishment for the queen Cassiopeia's vanity belonged to Poseidon and had no name.  But even these liberties with the source material are not the main problem of the film. The 3D effects, the main reason why I went to see it in the theater, were of poor quality - images had double edges and were unclear. Only after return from the cinema, I found out that the movie was not filmed in 3D but converted after the filming was over. To make it 3D, was the rushed decision, and as the result, did not add to the watching experience but made it worse. The film boasts a lot of action scenes, fast and furious but they were shot by a shaky camera and primarily cause a headache. I personally liked only one action scene, the battle with the Gorgon Medusa. To give a monster so terrifying that a glimpse at her would turn any creature into stone, Natalia Vodyanova's face, one of the most beautiful and adored faces in the world was a cute idea.  My advice - wait for the DVD but  if you  have to see it in the theater, save yourself the money and see the 2D version which I've heard is pretty decent visually. And do not say you have not been warned.",1272412800,4,3408,4.51948051948052
4032607,4,B002ZG9788,"Demi-god Perseus (Sam Worthington), the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson) and a human mother, undertakes a quest to save the city of Argos from the wrath of the Kraken, an enormous sea monster that the gods plan to release as punishment for defiance.

Director Louis Leterrier keeps the pace snappy and handles CGI creatures well, as he demonstrated with ""The Incredible Hulk.""  Some reviewers want more story, but it seems to me that the figures of Greek myth are generally at the mercy of fate and destiny, so I didn't miss the lack of motivations rooted deeply in character.  I also didn't mind the scrambling of mythology, although I wouldn't recommend this movie as a source for college students trying to crank out a term paper on Greek myths at the last minute.  I didn't even mind Perseus's buzzcut in a world where everyone else (even some of the women) have beards and long hair.  At least it's easy to pick him out of a crowd.  The giant scorpions, the Medusa, the harpies, and the Kraken all looked great and the action was exciting enough to keep me happily shoveling popcorn into my mouth.

BTW, I elected to see the film in 2D since I had read some bad reviews of the murky look of the film after the last minute decision to switch it to 3D.  ""Avatar"" demonstrated that 3D technology has finally arrived and is worth the extra bucks when done right.  However, too many Hollywood productions trying to jump onto the bandwagon with substandard product may make moviegoers think twice about paying higher ticket prices.",1272067200,5,1523,4.652985074626866
4032608,2,B002ZG9788,"This was a lackluster and at times cheesy remake of Clash of the Titans which only loosely follows the myth of Perseus. In this version, Zeus imprisons his brother Hades, (for no real apparent reason),  in the underworld. Hades, obviously angry at this betrayal is the bad guy and seeks revenge on Zeus. A mortal king, Acrisius,lays siege to mount Olympus- just because I guess. Zeus, to teach him a lesson has sex with Acrisius's wife Danae- although since this is Zeus we are talking about he rarely needs any reason to shag anyone. Danae conceives Perseus. Enraged, the king kills his wife, but Perseus, being a demi-god, survives and is raised by a fisherman and his family.

Perseus, (Sam Worthington) sporting a crewcut and a tunic, is adopted by a fisherman and lives an uneventful life troubled only by bouts of chest pains when it rains. Eventually his past catches up to him, and his family is killed in the crossfire by Hades.  Vowing revenge, Perseus decides to kill Hades to avenge his family. Together with a bland group of red shirt extras heroes, he agrees to help Andromeda to get revenge on Hades, (saving her life is just coincidental to his plan).

What can I say? The film was not that great. Sam Worthington was a poor choice for Perseus. He looked far too modern. He is supposed to be a Greek, but he looks and acts like a secret service agent.. His acting was bland and unconvincing. Andromeda who is supposed to be prettier than Aphrodite seemed quite plain, and the inclusion of the giant scorpions as riding beasts was perhaps the cheesiest thing I have seen in a while.  I did like the portrayal of Medusa as beautiful. Most of the cast, except for Perseus just waits around for their turn to die and added very little to the overall plot.

Overall, while this was watchable and the action enough to keep anyone from being bored, I thought the filmmakers were simply going through the motions. None of the characters really had any soul and alterations to the story which were made, such as: the silly anti-diety sentiment shared by Acrisius and Perseus, IO as a love interest, the scorpions etc. didn't really didn't add anything to the plot. This was a weak film which suffered from a poor screenplay, and screenwriter conceit.

The overall journey is just a so-so experience, typical of any movie these days, typically full of fast action and CG everything.  There is no comparison to the original movie, which without a doubt, completely overshadows this remake.

My companion at the movie made the funniest comment towards the end of the film.  Perseus has just spent a long time in the ocean and under water, and in the very next scene, he is STILL covered in grime and dirt.  Nice continuity.  We had a laugh about that one.

Perhaps the brightest spot in the movie immediately turns into the most disappointing occurrence, when Perseus, just before setting out on his journey, picks up a gold owl, yes old Bu-bo from the original film, and the owl gets 3 seconds of fame once again, until Perseus asks, what is this?  He is told ""leave it.""  Perseus sets it aside and we never see the owl again.  Pathetic.

There's a lot of action in this movie, and as a result, the overall story-tell is pretty lame.  I've seen many other reviews on this film, and without a doubt, they all say the same thing...""an okay film at best.""  Enough said.",1271721600,4,1203,4.565420560747664
4032710,2,B002ZG9788,"The more I think about the new ""Clash of the Titans"", the more ticked off I get. Shortly after it became apparent that ""Avatar"" would become a huge success, breaking box office records, Warner Brothers decided to make a change to ""Clash of the Titans"", their big budget remake of the 1981 cult favorite. Their new version, starring Sam Worthngton (also in ""Avatar"") was scheduled for release over the last weekend of March. But a large reason for the phenomenal success of ""Avatar"" is the premium charged for the 3-D screenings. Most theaters charge $5 extra for the glasses at a 3-D screening. A very significant portion of the tickets sold for the James Cameron phenomenon were for 3-D or IMAX screenings, pumping up the box office totals. Warner Brothers decided to 'retrofit' ""Clash of the Titans"", a film already completed in 2-D, for 3-D screenings. They found out the bare minimum of time it would take and pushed back their release date one week, so they wouldn't have to compete with Dreamworks' animated ""How To Train Your Dragon"", also a big (and better) 3-D release. I was one of the first people to rush to the theaters to see ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" when it was re-released in 3-D, so I figured this retrofit would be acceptable.

I figured wrong.

""Clash of the Titans"" is never going to be considered a great film, either version. Film enthusiasts remember the 1981 version as a late example of the great Ray Harryhausen's work. Harryhausen was a stop motion animator who created creatures and effects for a number of films like ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad"". The story is too inherently campy, historically inaccurate and the films are filled with too many actors of varying skill trying to play against one another. But this new film would have been a perfectly serviceable popcorn film, fun for a night out, fun to share with friends and then go and have a dinner where you laugh and discuss the antics of the characters and the story.

But because it was retrofitted for 3-D, and in a time frame that was apparently rushed, the film looks awful. I read one reviewer who commented that you will feel like you want to take your glasses off throughout the film. This was the problem with the old 3-D process. It wasn't very good and it bothered people with glasses or imperfect eyesight. The new process is a vast improvement, making almost everything look realistic and believable, like we are actually watching real life unfold before us. So why on Earth would we want to take a step backwards? Especially after we have had the opportunity to witness what gifted filmmakers can do in the medium. Films like ""Avatar"" and PIXAR's ""Up"" both demonstrate what this medium has the potential to achieve.

""Clash of the Titans"" is likely to make a lot of people think twice before plunking down the extra money for 3-D again. Throughout the film, it looks like they took two copies of the same characters and placed a slightly enlarged version in back of the actual image. Liam Neeson plays Zeus and he sports a wild mane of black hair cascading over his head and down his back. Frequently, when he turns slightly, it looks like his back is enlarging and he resembles Hagrid, played by Robbie Coltrane in the ""Harry Potter"" films. The 3-D process does nothing but make the film look more fake and unbelievable, drawing attention to the fact much of the film is created with computer animation. Because of this, we start paying a lot of scrutiny to everything and very little holds up. Everything begins to appear unrealistic and that is completely the opposite of what 3-D should do.

In a later scene, Worthington's Perseus is riding Pegasus to a battle with the Kraken. Clearly, the actor is not riding an actual flying horse, but you have to go into these films willing to suspend a certain amount of belief. So, Worthington is riding a CGI creation and the 3-D process draws our eyes to the way his head is moving in direct opposition to his torso and his legs. He looks like an action figure who is being posed for stop motion animation. Only instead of capturing a change every frame, to make it appear more fluid, it looks like they make a change every five, ten or fifteen frames, making it appear jerky.

Acting is never the strong point in films like this; the subject matter seems too inherently silly. We aren't there to see great acting, we are there to see what we hope might be a fairly believable adventure story, an adventure story enhanced by the 3-D and computer generated graphics. As discussed, the 3-D and the computer-generated graphics are out, so our eyes and our attention turn to other areas and begin to scrutinize. That other area is the acting. Liam Neeson headlines as Zeus, the God who is disappointed with the human race and enters into a deal with Hades, played by Ralph Fiennes. Hades and Zeus are brothers but Hades has a chip on his shoulder and a grudge to bear because Zeus tricked him. Each is acceptable, but when you also remember both actors were in ""Schindler's List"", you have to wonder why they would be interested in this film. Clearly, they had some bills to pay. They look suitably solemn and grave, and otherworldly throughout. In fact, after Hades gives the people an ultimatum, he hovers on a black cloud, moving back towards the door. Why does Hades need to use a door? Honestly, all I could think of was Ursula, the octopus sea witch from the animated classic ""The Little Mermaid"".

Sam Worthington has been cast in a number of films based on his anointment by James Cameron. He made ""Terminator Salvation"" and ""Clash"" after ""Avatar"". Honestly, he has been kind of dull and forgettable in all of the films.

The rest of the gods aren't even identified and only one has a line or two. This ""Clash"" is all about Perseus, Zeus and Hades. But Perseus flies into battle because he is protecting Andromeda (Alexa Davalos, ""The Mist"", TV's ""Reunion"", ""The Chronicles of Riddick""). Davalos never changes her expression throughout the film and looks like she is in pain. Why does he even care about her? She's pretty but he seems to meet her when we do and they never have a conversation let alone an intimate moment, they never seem to bond.

Mads Mikkleson (""Casino Royale""), Pete Postlethwhaite, Elizabeth McGovern, Polly Walker (HBO's ""Rome"", TV's ""Caprica"") and many others pop up for a few moments and then disappear.

A completely forgettable mess made all the more forgettable by bad 3-D. This ""Clash"" seems a gift from Hades himself.",1271721600,3,6538,4.697207678883071
4032711,3,B002ZG9788,"Being a huge fan of the original Clash of the Titans, even the quirky special effects (which were probably groundbreaking at the time), I had high hopes for this remade version.  Unfortunately, this version almost makes me want to retaliate upon the filmmakers like the gods smote the people of Argos in the original.

The story is essentially a Cliff's Notes version of the original, with Perseus (Sam Worthington) saving the citizens of Argos after they angered the gods by destroying temples and statues.  He embarks on a heroic quest, heavy-handedly aided by the gods - because his dad just happens to be Zeus (Liam Neeson) - to save humanity from the wrath of Zeus, unleashed via proxy by Hades (Ralph Fiennes).  If he is unsuccessful, the city's only option is to sacrifice princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) - no fault of her own, just a result of her mother Cassiopeia's ignorance and arrogance - to the Kraken, a sea monster unleashed by Poseidon.  During his journey with some soldiers of Argos, Perseus gets gifts and hints from not only his father, but the beautiful Io (Gemma Arterto - HUGE upgrade to Bergus Meredith), another demigod stuck in the middle of the story.

As with many movies recently, dialogue has taken a backseat to special effects and action sequences.  There's a watered down heroic thrust to the movie, and no real incentive for Perseus to save Argos, much less Andromeda; all he wants is revenge on the gods, and the people of Argos are an afterthought.  This is a major flaw considering Andromeda was the driving force of the original quest, and here she's merely window dressing.

I think the special effects are the deciding factor for this film.  All are stupendous, but at points it's subtraction by addition.

At times the original Pegasus flew straight out of Napoleon Dynamite's notebook, but the 2010 version is outstanding!  A major upgrade.  Each scene trumps the next, convincing the viewer of not only the scene's reality, but fluid movements suggest that a winged horse actually exists.  Great special effects.  The best, however, is clearly Medusa.  Snakes for hair, sinewy muscle, a lethal bow and arrow, a gaze that turns men to stone.  The combination was enough to leave children with nightmares in 1981, and every facet was improved upon.  Add in a sinister laugh and an upgraded crib replete with chasms, razor-sharp stalagmites, ""liquid hot magma,"" and the result is one of the scariest supernatural villains ever to appear on film.  (It's just too bad that she's so easy to kill in both version of COTT)

On the other hand, the Kraken feels much too extra terrestrial, maybe a bit too Cloverfield for my tastes.  A better option would have been the original Kraken's look with updated FX technology.  For me, the Kraken was a disappointment, but not nearly as bad as the witches.  Ahh...The Stygian Witches, wise sages, toil and trouble, cauldron and bubble, all that jazz.  Their appearance is not nearly as appealing as the original version.  Rather than looking like wise, tormented, evil witches, the new version, once again, looks like alien triplets.  Finally, the completely awesome scorpions.  Perhaps the coolest subplot of both films, the giant scorpions form a dangerous obstacle for Perseus and his fellowship.  The problem with the remake is the scorpions' lethality is minimized when they are turned into nothing more than Clydesdales after an epic battle.  And I'm not even going to discuss Jar Jar Djinn.  Horrible!

Verdict: If you fondly remember the original, wait for the rental.  If you don't remember or didn't like the original, you'll probably love this.

The action scenes were good and the visuals nice, though paying extra for the 3D was a waste. I felt like I ordered a pepperoni pizza and only got 4 slices of peperoni on it. Where were all the great 3D effects? There were only a handful of them.

The acting was good at times and completely absent at other points, especially from Zeus & Hades. It was just brand name actors in wardrobe adding nothing to the movie. The scenes where they go into Medusa's lair in order to defeat her were the best ones of the film I thought. The ending was pretty anti-climactic. I mean after Medusa is defeated, the battle with the Cracken and Hades took all of about 4 minutes! Still the movie was enjoyable, and this IS a good theatre movie. I would have gave it 4 stars, but frankly I was disappointed in the 3D experience and I thought they could have done a little something more original with the storyline.

Sam Worthington (""Terminator: Salvation"") was perfectly cast as Perseus, as was Gemma Atterton as Io, Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades (interestingly, this movie marks the first time Neeson and Fiennes have been on screen together since Steven Spielberg's epic drama ""Schindler's List""). Everyone was st to a perfect T in this film. The music is nothing less than epic. The 3-D effects are AWESOME. I've only a few minor quibbles: for one thing, I noticed that several scenes in the trailer (including one where Andromeda says to Perseus, ""This isn't your fight"" and he replies, ""Someone has to take a stand"") were cut from the movie. Secondly, I was disappointed that Medusa didn't speak in this versio (though the additonal screaming was perfect). Thirdly, I would have liked a flashback, showing Medusa before Athena transformed her into the creature we see in the temple (she was still beautiful until she screamed; I had no problem with her still being beautiful, though).

Special Features:

The Blu-Ray edition is the best way to experience this epic movie heavily based in green screen CGI technology. The most amazing aspect is a feature I've never seen before but think should be in ALL Blu-Ray movies is the Maximum Movie Mode which is a complex picture-in-picture way of watching the film where it will zoom out from the movie itself and put it aside where you can still see it while bringing up another box with scene breakdowns, effects breakdowns, and on-the-spot vignettes all the while you are watching the movie! For example, in one of the beginning scenes you are watching Perseus and his father talking on the fishing boat and at the same time you can see how the boat was built, complications the crew faced in getting it to work, and other behind the scenes moments.

Many of my main complaints about the film are recognized in deleted scenes and the alternate ending. For example, I disliked how after all the set-up for Perseus not wanting the gods help that he just got this easy going peace with Zeus at the end. The alternate ending was preferable for me because Perseus goes all the way up to Mount Olympus on his Pegasus to face Zeus in a manly way shrugging him off once and for all. My biggest problem with the movie was that we only focused on two of the gods: Zeus and Hades while all the others stood around and never got to talk. In the deleted scenes, you will find much more character development and dialogue from all the other gods getting involved, having opinions on Zeus's actions, and even one going down to Earth to talk to Perseus and give him the gold coin. At some point in the process, a decision was made to go in the other direction but I think the original idea of having all the others involved was a stronger choice. Another nice thing about getting to see these deleted scenes that aren't completely up to par with the special effects is that you get a chance to admire the shiny, metallic costumes the gods wear that you can barely see with all the glowy effects bling added post production during the film.

Another feature praises Sam Worthington as being an ""action hero for the ages"" mainly highlighting his willingness to do his own stunt work as much as possible. There are many small featurettes on individual aspects of production, but the best way to get that full experience I think is to watch that Maximum Movie Mode which is very thorough and if there's a boring moment, you have the option of going back to watching the movie and ignoring it. Choices are great!",1270944000,3,3362,5.127737226277373

4032717,1,B002ZG9788,"Yet again I ask myself: If they didn't like the story of Perseus and Andromeda why did they use these names in the movie? Why not call them Bilesus and Jaena who lived on the planet raxz, for example? It would still be an idiotic story but at least it would not give us the impression we know anything about Perseus or Greek mythology.

I didn't know much about Perseus before tonight but the storyline was such an insult to common sense and general knowledge that I knew it could not be right. The so-called hero of the story needs to fight a monstrous creature protected by some god (why?). He is offered help from another god but he refuses (a very smart move!). Then he accept help when he sees he can't succeed otherwise (of course, he couldn't have foreseen this need because humans can typically kill 90 feet monsters protected by a god, just with the help of a few good friends!).  He hates the gods, but then he doesn't really, or does he?

Well, I came home and read about Perseus. I came to the conclusion that the Ancient Greeks may not have known how to make 3D movies but they could tell a coherent and interesting story! Apparently, that is too difficult for these 21st century moviemakers.

Even the special effects were poor. The special creatures as very sketchy and are shown very briefly so they would not have to do a lot of detailed CG on them. Save your money or go see ""How to train your Dragon"". If you just like to see violence for violence's sake why not watch some wrestling, it's cheaper and more amusing.

And where were the Titans? I guess in all the rush to have yet another person stabbed, bitten or crushed they forgot the title of the movie!",1270857600,3,1676,4.393548387096774

4032789,4,B002ZG9788,"I've never seen the original Clash of the Titans so I really had no expectations going into this remake. So while I can't vouch for it's faithfulness to the original story I can say this film is 100% fun from beginning to end.

The plot follows loosely the story of Perseus and his rebellion of his godly heritage. It's not a very complicated plot, in fact there's not much to it than the whole lone outcast hero saves the world (or city in this case) against overwhelming odds. I don't think this is a bad thing at all. I realise after last year being spoiled with socially grounded spectecles like District 9 and Avatar (sort of) it's nice to see a high-end adventure film that doesn't have any hidden agenda. This isn't to say the film's mindless, it's actually got a very engaging tale to tell. You just won't be drawing any links to any modern political conflicts.

Another great thing about this movie is it's acting. Sam Worthington is becoming my favorite action star (especially after his terrific work in Terminator 4 and Avatar). He's got more charisma and presence than any other action-hero actor out there and is a perfect choice to play Perseus. Ralph Fiennes also great as the alternating creepy and over-powering Hades. Gemma Arterton is well cast as the angel-faced Lo, who act's as Perseus guide and conscience.

With the uncomplicated plot the special effects and actions scenes become Clash of the Titan's bread and butter..and man do they rock! I don't know why when dealing with big monsters in film they always make the criters look kinda cheesy. This is NOT the case with Clash of the Titans. The giant scorpians look deadly, Medusa is just as creepy as her backstory, and the Kraken gives you that ""holy-crap"" moment few films can pull off. The special effects are even put to good use when introducing the gods (Hades killing off Perseus' family is brief but particularly memorable).

So while Clash of the Titans isn't going to win any big picture awards it is a hell of alot of fun. I never saw it in 3D nor do I want to. The special effects are just fine the way they are. There's nothing deep here, just good actors, good action, and a great sense of adventure.",1270771200,7,2192,4.59846547314578
4032790,3,B002ZG9788,"Like many of my peers who grew up in the eighties, Clash of the Titans holds a special place in my heart.  Harryhausen's vision burned certain iconic moments in my memory:  My Clash of the Titan's lunchbox.  My winged Pegasus toy with Harry Hamlin-looking Perseus (complete with vacuous gaze and stiff arms).  Shouting ""Perseus!"" and throwing any stick-like object (hockey sticks, bats, edged weapons) to my friends. All these elements have ensured a certain reverence for Clash of the Titans, not to mention hopelessly muddling my knowledge of Greek history until well into my high school years.

This new version of Clash of the Titans is not that movie (spoilers ahead!):

Oh, it's a reimagining of course.  There are attempts to provide the shadow of a coherent plot to the whole thing.  The original was actually a love story; the jealous goddess Thetis became Perseus' nemesis over his love for poor Andromeda, with Zeus surreptitiously helping his errant son.  In the remake Zeus is openly hostile to humanity, who is apparently attempting to overthrow the gods by...blowing up their statues, I guess. Hades manipulates Zeus into terrorizing humanity instead of asking for their prayers.  Two drachmas to the person who guesses the trick Hades has up his sleeve.

The movie hits all the high points: Calibos (Acrisius in the new version), Pegasus, Medusa, the scorpions, the Kraken.  And for the first half at least, the plot shambles along pleasantly and the audience can marvel at the breathtaking score and dizzying 3D.

Then the Djinn show up.  I have a phrase I called ""jump the monkey"" which is a bit like ""jump the shark."" The last installment of Indiana Jones had me interested until vine-swinging monkeys jumped to the rescue of our hero.  The moment turned pulp heroic fun into retrograde cartoon pandering to audiences of all ages.  The Djinn are Clash of the Titans' ""monkey jump.""

Because this new incarnation of the movie has to be Bigger and Better than anything we've seen before, the scorpions that arise from Acrisius' blood (not Medusa's like in the original) are gargantuan. So big, in fact, that it stretches our willing suspension of disbelief that our heroes will even be able to defeat them.  And then they do.  Whew! A jump cut later and...

BIGGER scorpions show up.  These are colossal.  Our heroes can't possibly defeat them.  Fortunately, we have a deus ex machine in the form of Djinn.  They are ""sand demons,"" some kind of Greek-style cyborgs who replace their broken bodies with magic.  They have cool blue glowing eyes and know how to control giant scorpions.  Actually, they RIDE them.

Scorpions.  Giant scorpions.  That didn't exist until Acrisius bled.  The Djinn carry around entire howdahs just to ride these giant scorpions in the span of just one day.  I made up a reason for why this is. Surely the scorpions were created from the sand, not Acrisius' blood, and that's why the Djinn are so familiar with them.  Yeah, okay, I'll roll with it...

But wait...why are the Djinn still hanging around?  Why is one of the Djinn joining Perseus' party?  Why, when Perseus is trying to rouse his troops as they descend into Medusa's lair, is the Greek equivalent of a Wookie going along with them? Why has this movie jumped the monkey?

I was so dazzled by the special effects that it didn't even dawn on me until my wife pointed it out. Medusa's gaze doesn't work on the Djinn, but it works on a Kraken? Did anyone else notice this Kraken-sized flaw in the plot?  Or did the directors just figure the 3D would make up for it?

It didn't.  As much as I tried to love this new version of Clash of the Titans, I can't.  I can merely appreciate it for the big, dumb, Kraken of a movie it is.",1270771200,3,3729,4.729813664596273

This presentation shows that CGI and 3D do not a film make. It helps to have dialog, pacing and a little better knowledge of antiquity.  As far as CGI is considered, some things can look scary and others like cartoons. This film falls somewhere in the middle but not as bad as it could have been. They only used what was needed to tell their story in today's action packed terms. I saw this movie in the theater for the 3D experience. I wanted to see if it was an improvement over the red and green or red and blue glasses.
So far, I will hold judgment. Some 3D can be eye popping and make you duck as it is coming at you. In the case of this movie, it was more like looking through a stereoscope or View Master. The third dimension was behind the front plate. Combining the CGI fast action with the 3D technology created a hairy mess and you had to wait until it was over to guess what happened. In any event, I now have a new set of glasses to add to my collection.

I am slightly prejudice because I saw the original Clash and know what the movie could have been. However, it was not as bad as it could have been and has all the earmarks of a Hallmark special. The original film took a few liberties with the story but this version was out of the ballpark. See it once to help appreciate the original.",1270684800,5,1884,4.184573002754821
4032792,2,B002ZG9788,"I really enjoyed the original 1981 version when I was a kid and I still enjoy it now. I still pop the DVD in the player for a watch from time to time. The FX are dated and cheesy and some of the performances are a little over the top, but the original version had such a charm and quailty that makes it somewhat of a classic for Hollywood's golden age of summer blockbusters.

Now for the newest ""remake"".

Well, first off, let's start with the star, Sam Worthington (Terminator:Salvation and Avatar). Sam is a stoic, passionless and expressionless actor. Think William Shatner on downers. His Marine Corps high-and-tight hairdo ruins all credibility and believability of the character of Perseus and his performance is exactly the same as his performances in his previous films. They didn't even TRY to make him look Greek or, at the very least, European.

Liam Neeson, usually a fine actor, struts about as the immortal Zues spouting out ham-fisted dialogue and chewing up the scenery. He looks like he is still dressed in his costume from ""Excalibur"". What a waste of a fine actor.

The whole film seems to be focused on action rather than plot or character developement. Some characters simply show up and really have nothing whatsoever to do rather than take up screen time. Also, this version completely ignores the actual mythology that it derives from (so did the original, only not quite as much as the 2010 version).

The FX were decent enough, but as it goes all to often in Hollywood lately, they aren't enough to salvage a weak script, bad acting and bad casting. The FX are the only reason that this film rates two stars in my book.

My summary opinion, rent (or buy) the original and enjoy a much more satisfying movie-going experience.",1270684800,15,1751,4.705882352941177

4032794,3,B002ZG9788,"A good amount of action and impressive CGI bolsters this remake which to be honest flags a bit at times.
Even an A list cast, and Sam Worthington (fresh from Avatar and Terminator Salvation) unfortunately can't lift it above average.
The usual debate ensues about the 3D added as an afterthought, and whether it adds anything, I saw the 2D version so can't comment on that, although I noticed a couple of scenes obviously deliberately designed with the 3D medium in mind.
On a side note, if 3D is going to be the new gold standard, then please filmmakers, stop using every opportunity to have things fly out of the screen for a cheap effect. Avatar was good in 3D exactly because it did not exploit the audience, but I digress.
Most people who remember Harry Hamlin et al in the 1981 original will not be able to help but make comparisons, and the storyline and chronology is quite similar.
However, whereas I would not have said the original was a deep drama, it had a far more solid story, and makes this updated CGI festival pale in comparison.
As much as I like Sam Worthington, he was wooden most of the time, pausing between action sequences to deliver  ""man against the Gods"" speeches, which he fails to carry off each time with any conviction.
The biggest difference in the two movies is of course that the first was a love story.
Perseus, driven by his love for Andromeda (the beautiful and delicate Judy Bowker) has a passion, that is missing here somehow. As Perseus is merely on a vendetta against Hades.
The feud and story with Calibos was much more integral to the plot than here also, where this time around that character seems to be little more than a disgruntled mercenary working for Hades.
I'm not going to delve into the story any more than that, so no spoilers.
It is a good two hours of escapism, and fun to watch Liam Neeson, and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus, and Hades respectively chewing up scenery at every given opportunity.
Probably the last of the stop motion classics involving the great Ray Harryhausen, the original movie looks laughable in comparison to today's effects, but as we have seen so often, effects alone don't always mean a great movie.
Sure to do well at the box office, it is a visual feast if nothing else, and although I don't agree with some of the scathing reviews it's received from the media, and film critics, it did fall short of my expectations. 3.5 Stars.",1270684800,2,2406,4.569444444444445

It's funny that Leterrier's film was supposed to have its visual effects stand as its greatest strength when as it turns out some of his action scenes, and more specifically the interactions between CGI monsters and normal characters, are about as seamless as Harryhausen's outdated efforts, which were themselves outgunned by George Lucas and others thirty years ago.  Harryhausen's work was probably deemed most eye-popping almost sixty years ago (i.e.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-7th-Voyage-of-Sinbad/dp/B00001W9GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</a>).  Yes, there are some state of the art effects happening but they are handled by subpar imaginations and creativity that is definitely more miss than hit, and I mean that commentary to apply further to the costumes, sets, and make-up threefold.  The make-up is bad, the concepts are trite and at times over-stylized, and the hair!  Oh my goodness, the hair.  It seems that every alpha warrior of Argos has three hours to strategically place mud on themselves, apply eye-liner, and create extravagant cornrows and dreadlock-like mullet extensions.  And if you think I'm only going to be critical of this movie's visual flaws, keep reading.

First, let's summarize.  The film follows a family of fisherman with the usual British accents who stumble upon a demi-god baby named Perseus (Sam Worthington).  As the story unfolds and the gods get really mad at people for thinking they are cooler than the gods, Perseus gets mad enough to allow his rage and taste for vengeance drive him toward going after the oh-so evil god of Hades and his vile sea creature titan, the Kraken.  But in order to do that he needs Medusa's head, and in order to get that he needs to talk to these batty old blind witches, and in order to do that he needs to fight a whole bunch of gigantic scorpions.  Along the way he also better start liking and praying to his god daddy so he can use a flying horse and his fancy but kind of ancient-looking lightsaber.  He's got to save Andromeda (played meaninglessly by Alexa Davalos) and maybe even at the end of the story Zeus will be kind of enough to grant him a lovely sex slave in Io (played yummy-ly by Gemma Arterton).

Worthington's acting can be described as kind of like Russell Crowe in that really intense scene in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gladiator/dp/B000NU2CY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gladiator</a>&nbsp;when Maximus reveals himself to Commodus in the arena, only Worthington talks like that all the time and it never ever changes, not even for a second.  Liam Neeson (Zeus) hams it up and Ralph Fiennes (Hades) makes Neeson's performance look comparably very serious.  Polly Walker (Casseopiea) recycles her role as Atia in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/HBO-s-Rome/dp/B0028RXXE8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">HBO's Rome</a>&nbsp;but strictly in the most superficial sense, because she was wasted and her role, like many here, was merely part of the set.  Danny Huston (Poseidon) was completely wasted.  The rest of the cast came off as a bunch of awkward live action role-players gathered together right from their LARPing event as starstruck extras, but they were instead given speaking parts.  Even worse than that was a character who I can't seem to find a name for anywhere.  He was a priest of sorts who looked to worship Hades and sacrifice Andromeda.  He delivers truly some of the worst acting I've seen in a very very long time.

The acting is an easy target and so is the writing.  Many will forgive these things but I will not, so keep that in mind.  The writing in scenes with less action is unbearable and the screenplay is lazy, even for a remake of a film with a lazy screenplay to begin with.  Still, I'm really being hard on this film when it did have some brights spots that are incredibly memorable and show-off the amazing CGI without being too gratuitous.  To say the film doesn't go way overboard at times with its effects is an understatement.  Instead of coming out of a cage deep in the ocean the Kraken is released after the entire ocean floor breaks open.  His exit from the water is indeed remarkable but you know that already if you've seen the commercials; it's just a longer version of that.  The Pegasus is beautiful too and the horse they had was great.  The real work with the horse combined with the very believable CGI in his scenes were seamless and very enjoyable.  However, the best scene in the movie has been kept pretty well from the public and that is of course Medusa.  Instead of the ugly stop-motion snake lady slithering quietly in the memorable gothic horror-like scene from the original 1981 movie, we get a beautiful face within a mane of snakes and a fast-moving gorgon that petrifies her enemies in by far the most keenly edited footage the film has to offer.  That scene by itself might be worth the price of admission to many but it still doesn't quite capture the charm of the original stop-motion Medusa.

This isn't an inspired movie but for the most part it doesn't deviate from the spirit of the original, for better or worse.  It even makes one very well placed inside joke to lovers of the original film, but that scene's charm is quickly snuffed out by alarming and unintentional irony.  If I was twelve that would've gone over my head and this movie gets 4 out of 5 stars, but I'm not twelve. One more thing, the 3-D adds virtually nothing to this film as an experience seeing in a theater, unless you count wearing dark glasses for two hours.  Wait for DVD or blu-ray.",1270598400,3,6244,5.360655737704918
4032797,4,B002ZG9788,"When it was announced that a remake of the classic Clash of the Titans with Harry Hamlin was being made, I was quite enthusiastic, given the power of today's special effects and how it could bring to life the many creatures explored in the original. Now having seen it, I am firm in my estimation that the 2010 version is an interesting take on an old classic. Now before the numerous fans of the original gather to stone me in the street, I offer this reasoning for my assessment. The true power of a remake lies in how the movie goer defines the concept itself. One interpretation is that a remake should somehow ""regurgitate"" the original, but just provide some new polishing on it in terms of effects and visuals. However, I prefer a different understanding of the remake, where the film provides a re-envisioning of the original, while retaining some essential elements. The new ""Clash of the Titans"" fits this profile. I applaud the fact that the makers of this film were not afraid to take it into different directions. In doing so, what movie goers have with this film is a more condensed version that explores the inner turmoil of man rather than focusing centrally on the often childish inclinations of the Olympian gods. In effect, Perseus is more humanized by the fact that his existence is not so contingent upon the gods' favor, especially with his otherworldly father Zeus. Subsequently, the adventure he partakes in is more effectual for the audience since he grows as a person and leader with each step he takes in achieving his goals and fulfilling his purpose. Essentially, the stakes on the situation seemed so much more higher.  With the original, that type of growth, purpose, and gamble seemed absent since the viewer knew that Perseus would inevitably succeed since he had the favor of Zeus. Though the original version offers a more complicated and rich story, the minimalist approach exercised in the remake is still enough to entertain.

Aside from story analysis, the film does have fine performances by veteran actors Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes as Zeus and Hades, respectively. Neeson brings a very commanding presence to the king of the gods, and Fiennes really embodies the saying ""something wicked this way comes"" with his portrayal of Hades. Sam Worthington succeeds in his portrayal of Perseus, and the other cast and characters were handled well. Lastly, the special effects are stunning in the 2D version of the film.  Overall, I think that if a movie goer approaches this film with an open mind, he or she may be surprised by what will be seen. You decide.",1270512000,4,2596,4.816143497757848
4032798,3,B002ZG9788,"I was a big fan of the 1981 movie Clash of the Titans. It had everything I loved: action, excitement, Greek mythology! It was a great film for its time and still holds up at least somewhat today. Sure, the effects have aged, but that's to be expected.

It was also a movie that pushed me even more into my budding interest in Greek mythology; an interest which has continued to this very day. Heck, I got quite an interest in mythology in general and even took a course in it when I was in high school (and designed my own pantheon of gods for extra credit).

So I went to the new version with a certain set of expectations. I wanted to see gods, Medusa, Calibos, the Kraken and some good ole fashioned swords and sandals combat. Anything further, like a good story line and decent acting, were to be considered nice bonuses.

With those moderate exceptions in mind, this movie delivers quite well. Gods? Check. Medusa? Check. Calibos? The Kraken? Oh, definite check. Mind you, the gods are largely unnamed and don't do a lot, Medusa isn't as interesting as she was in the original film, Calibos goes by a different name in all but one sentence and the Kraken... well, actually still looks pretty impressively Kraken-esque.

The plot is pretty basic: Queen Danae (a name never mentioned in the movie, which sucked cause I used to know a girl with that name), gives birth to Perseus, the son of Zeus. Her husband is a bit irked by this and dumps her and her son into the sea. They're recovered but Danae is already dead. Perseus is raised by the fisherman who found them. The boy grows up to be a man played by Sam Worthington who watches the gods kill his adopted family, sees Hades threaten Argos and eventually gets caught up in a war between the men and the gods.

The plot is pretty basic, and frankly seems a bit more basic than it was in the original film. The presence of a Burges Meredith character is also sorely missed (though the owl, Bupo, puts in a brief appearance), as the replacement, Draco, handles Perseus' training a little too quickly to be satisfying. I also found Sam Worthington's performance to be less interesting than his performance in Avatar, and given how basic that was, that's saying something.

The effects are all that you'd expect from a modern CGI-heavy film. I saw it in 2-D as there wasn't any reason not to. Everything looked good, nothing looked overly fake. The giant scorpions were impressive.

Beyond that, the various characters were all essentially background dressing. Hades was somewhat interesting (though I could really do without him being portrayed as evil all the time. Hades was not evil), but not all that great. Zeus' armor was way too bright and looked very out of place for a Greek era, but the character himself was... well, somewhat interesting. None of the other gods even have speaking roles, beyond a couple words from Apollo, so there's really nothing there. All the Greeks except Draco and some mad guru who for all the world looks like he should be worshiping Krishna (he even has the third eye thing going on!), are pretty interchangeable.

Also at the end there's a very blatant setup for a sequel which could actually be interesting. I'd love to see Perseus going off and encountering other Greek heroes (perhaps an Argonauts film?), or even heroes from other mythologies. Imagine would could be done with a film showing him facing off against Gilgamesh and Enkidu!

I have a great sense that this film was originally supposed to be about a half-hour longer. There's several parts where it seems like there's scenes missing (how does Perseus get back out of the underworld?), and certain people who were clearly supposed to have speaking roles, like Alexander Siddig as Hermes, aren't really on screen at all. It has studio meddling all over it. I look forward to a director's cut that might restore some of these scenes and make for a better, more interesting film. What we have now isn't bad, but it could be so much, much better.

Oh, and for all you Skins fans out there, let me tell you now so you won't sit there wondering all movie like I did: yes, that's Nicholas Hoult as Eusebios.",1270512000,,4157,4.62059620596206
4032859,1,B002ZG9788,"I have never seen such a disregard for the original material before this movie. Everything that made the original film so epic (The love story, the depth of the characters, the underhandedness among the Gods) was not as in depth and seemed shallow is this telling, and at times ever backhanded. The use of key elements were not uses to the fullest, and others seemed to even be changed for spite.

Where is the teacher of Perseus, Bubo was thrown to the side like trash, the Kraken looked like something out of a Spawn comic (not to say that's bad, it just didn't fit this film), the scorpions being tamed was retarded not to mention the fight sequences in that part seemed like the choreography was not very fluint and the blood came from Madusa not Calibos! Calibos wasn't even as devious as he should have been! Don't even get me started on why they put Hades in the film and I felt Zues did seem to have the ""I am all there is"" feel and I don't blame that on Liam  that's the writing.

Now the parts I liked, The witches were fine except for the way they did the eye, however it's livable. The Roman soldiers were fine because there was a build to befriending Perseus. Pegusas was fine, I just wish Pegusas was in the film more.

How this movie could have saved this film. Being more true to the original film. Add a half our, and make it less Lord of the Rings meets Scorpion King and it would have been a more cohesive film.

The only improvement that viewers will find here is in the special effects department which should be expected as the original movie was made in 1981 (29 years ago).  The CG monsters in the remake while more visually impressive than Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion animations lack the personality and life he breathed into his creations.  These new monsters also look dated and uninspired when compared to other CG monsters.  Better CG monsters have been presented to audiences in older films (i.e. King Kong, Lord of the Rings, and Jurassic Park).  Being that these new CG incarnations are so numb and hollow when they appear on screen audiences will find themselves quickly bored.

The story doesn't help matters either as this story is less about the Greek myths or the original film.  This films treatment of the characters and storyline is more about the screen writers' interpretation of Christianity and their resentment towards it.  In this film Zeus is made to be more like the Christian god.  In this Clash of the Titans Zeus is a god who loves human kind and gains strength from their love and prayers.  Added to this remake is his brother Hades who has been conveniently transformed to be like Lucifer.  He rules the underworld and gains strength from human fear and pain.  The two are locked in a power struggle for control of the humans since whomever controls the humans will be the most powerful God.  Caught in the middle of this power struggle are humans and the demigod Perseus.  The humans are fed up with the whims of the gods and feel like their prayers go unheard.  Perseus on the other hand has decided to go to war with the gods because a boat that his adoptive family was on was sunk by Hades inadvertently causing everyone to drown except for him.  This spin on things has Perseus doing a whole lot of whining and whatever else it takes to prove that man doesn't need the gods to prevail since this movie is a thinly veiled atheist propaganda film.

This new take on things is definitely no improvement of the storyline or characterizations of the original movie which were based more so on Greek mythology and focused on creating a believable fantasy world inhabited by awe inspiring beings and creatures.  The original film's introduction of Medusa and the Kraken are light years ahead of the remake's.  In the original film Medusa was a hideous monstrous to be reckoned with.  When she showed up in the film her scenes were chilling and suspenseful.  In the new movie Medusa has the rendered face of a supermodel and comes across as just plain silly.  The same can be said for the Kraken in the new film.  When the Kraken is introduced in the film it is one of the most anticlimactic moments in the entire film, unlike the original were in the scenes it showed up in were awe inspiring.  In closing this Clash of the Titans remake is imbecilic and completely unnecessary.  In fact this remake might possibly be one of the worst movies ever made.

4032861,3,B002ZG9788,"Well, the long awaited remake of Clash of the Titans is here, and as with all remakes, the story/screen play is always redone heavily. The Stop-Motion that Ray Haryhausen had done for the original has been abandoned in favor of the slicker looking CG. It's not always a good bet, bad CG is just that...Bad. While it wasn't terrible in the re-make it wasn't the best that this film deserved and that is reflective in the story as well.

While some things were swapped, new characters invented, and other parts of the original story re-arranged it wasn't a terrible film. The original was far slower and well...a bit hokier to say the least. The new rendition of Clash of the Titans went for a faster moving storyline while adopting the George Miller ""300"" look and feel, only to fall short.

There were some good scenes and action, the remake of this classic falls short. Kids will love the FX (and why they wouldn't?).I also imagine there will be a play station or X-Box release of this film into the game world. In the end, this was a film that has A-list actors taking an easy pay day and while Sam Worthington is the ""new, hot Aussie"" in the sights of Hollywood, this isn't a film I'd be boasting about on my resume.

Worthington's performance is often ""wooden"" and much the same as seen in other films like Terminator 4 and his other overrated  ""big blockbuster"" Avatar. Well,at least he is consistant, but ""much of the same"" is just that...""the generic and fake action hero"" portrayal seen in all his parts.

The other thing that eludes me the casting. Why does Hollywood insist on casting actors with Australian,Irish and British accents?Because they have accents? Lame. This was/is suppose to be a Greek story/fable. There were no limies around back then on the Greek islands.

It is worth renting, but this film is a poor rendition and seems only cheapened as the Hollywood money machine turns for the allmighty dollar and produces only an  feeble product in the end. Shame on the studios,actors for agreeing to this project. It could have been a spectacular film and instead of really taking care to make something worthy of re-making the 1980 Harryhausen classic it only deficates on it with a lousy T.V series story/plot,action and really bad CG.",1270425600,,2257,4.713197969543147
4032862,1,B002ZG9788,"I also watched and loved the original Clash of the Titans, and, I really wanted to like this adaption.  unfortunately, it relied almoste entirely on special effects, and fell far short on story telling.  They not only ruined a great story, but the characters were so unlikeable, that you didn't care if they succeeded or not.  Whoever was responsible for this adaptation, fell far short.  If you have not ever seen the originaly, I highly recommend it.",1270339200,6,452,4.8311688311688314
4032863,1,B002ZG9788,"Zzzzz... yet another movie with terrific CGI, a garbled plot, no human emotional connection, and a mixed bag of awful to above average acting.  I actually started to fall asleep at various points in this movie....

One's senses are not quite as assaulted as with ""Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen"", but this movie falls into that same class of an action movie hyped mainly for its special effects and yet unable to hold our attention just on that basis.  Yes, there was a time, back in the days of ""Jurassic Park"", when merely seeing this awe-inspiring CGI onscreen was enough to keep a moviegoer awake, but no more.  Nowadays, terrific CGI is so ubiquitous that it is easy to be blase about seeing it onscreen;  the CGI is just part of a movie's landscape, like the potted plants and furniture.

Enough, my eyes and ears tell me, so what if the Kraken/Medusa/Giant Crab/Monster Du Jour is attacking - do I care enough about the characters and plot that it means anything?  Without that essential emotional connection to the story and characters, watching massive quantities of CGI is just as sleep inducing as watching potted plants grow.

Sam Worthington is in this movie, which might be enough to keep his fans awake, but I am baffled at how he has managed to become a mega-movie star in such a short time.  A published critical review of his performance said that his CGI ""Avatar"" character had more facial expressions than he did in this movie.  Another said that his acting was so wooden that it belonged in the lumbar section of the Home Depot.

Mads Mikkelsen was one of the few actors to squeeze a capable performance out of this movie, as Draco, the co-leader of Perseus's merry band of monster-chow.  Kudos to him for managing to retain his dignity, much more than Liam Neeson or Ralph Fiennes were able to do in this movie.  The presence of these two stars bring to mind the latter days of Sir Laurence Olivier, who was willing to appear in almost any bad movie as long as they paid his fee.  I would love to know just what was going through Liam Neeson's mind as he was walking around in that silly mirror-polished suit of armor and scraggly beard.  Come to think of it, he did once do both in ""Excaliber""... so maybe that's what he was thinking.  Ralph Fiennes - has playing one of the most effective evil Nazis of all time onscreen (""Schindler's List"") made him a lock for all the blockbuster Evil Bad Guy roles in Hollywood?  Take the money and run, is what seems to be going on here.

One interesting visual effect of this movie was that all of the males were tanned a dark shade of bronze, whereas the two main female characters were left strikingly pale, which made me think that in the time of the Ancient Greeks,  men and women were of different races.  Or, perhaps the women were just locked up indoors all the time.  Both women were cute and did a decent job in their roles, but the shag rug carpet  which Io wore in her last scenes made me want to burst out laughing.  Poor Gemma Arterton.

Yes, the costume designer for this movie was beyond horrible.  I could go on and on about the horrible costuming.

Even worse, the Continuity Director must have been on drugs during the entire shoot.  Or maybe it was just really bad film editing, combined with a fractured screenplay.  Did anybody else notice the beautiful shot of sunlight breaking through the clouds....... during the total eclipse?  Right, it does get awfully dark during a total eclipse, and that entire Kraken vs. Argos scene (with Alexa Davalos getting strung up as Kraken food) should have been in the dark, or twilight.

But then, almost nothing made sense in this movie.  The initial entry into the palace of the King of Argos - was it a festival or something?  What was with all the music and dancing girls?  Perseus and his group journey into Hades - Charon is mentioned, but barely seen - not enough left in the budget for a better Charon?  Then, having crossed the River Styx, they are not in Hades, but in Medusa's lair.  WTF?  And when Perseus comes out, he is seen exiting a cave.  What happened to recrossing the River Styx?

More questions - Why is Pegasus black?  What happened to Calibos's hand? (an interesting teaser, watching his hand come back to life... and then nothing).  Why is it mentioned that Medusa can only turn men to stone, not women, and then the Kraken gets turned to stone when it sees the Medusa head? Does the Medusa head turn fish and crustaceans to stone also?  How about insects?  And oh dear me, WHY IS MEDUSA WEARING A BLACK BRA?  Imagine putting a bra on your pet snake, yes that's what that looked like.

And of course, one cannot go through the list of what's totally bad in this movie without mentioning the obligatory Hollywood caricature of the Extremist Religionist, who is stuck into this movie like a sore thumb.  He appears as this skinny bare chested guy with mascara eyeliner shrieking in a British accent about offering up Andromeda as a sacrifice.  In between trying to stay awake, I could only groan and sigh ""Not again"" at the grating appearance of this character....

There were lots of things like that which made me want to close my eyes during this movie...",1270339200,37,5208,4.5625
4032864,2,B002ZG9788,"Clash of the Titans is essentially a watered down version of a live-action adaptation of the God of War video game. Seriously. The only difference is the main character's name. While this could be considered a compliment, it really isn't. A God of War film is pointless now unless they decide to do a full-blown R-rated version of it.

Certain other things about the film really bugged me. The main one being that the two main female characters Io and Andromeda cried at EVERYTHING. Every time they spoke it was like they started getting teary eyed. ""Oh Perseus, I can't follow you into Medusa's lair since I'm not a big strong man like you are. *sob*"" Just made me want to slap them and go, ""GET A GRIP, LADY! SHEESH!"" The biggest pet peeve of mine lies in the finale of the film. Everything regarding Hades and the kraken are dealt with so quickly. The film makes a huge deal about both of them only to have everything wrapped up in less than five minutes when the time finally comes. It just wound up feeling very rushed and anticlimactic.

Despite all of the things I found wrong with the film, there were some high points. The CG seemed very all or nothing to me. At times, the effects were fantastic. The giant scorpions scene and the kraken being the best examples. Pegasus is also a great example. The winged horses looked fairly genuine, but they looked kind of odd when they flew. Other times though, it seemed way too obvious that the characters were standing in front of a green screen and fighting with creatures that weren't actually there. There's a scene near the beginning where we first see Perseus as an adult where his father is talking to him and a thunderstorm is beginning to brew. The sky was obviously CG. There were just several moments like that that brought me out of the film.

Clash of the Titans was one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year, but fell short and wound up being one of the most disappointing. With mediocre special effects, a sloppy finale, and female characters that will get on your last nerve, the action film fails to live up to expectations. At the end of the day, Clash of the Titans is basically just a glorified Xena: Warrior Princess.",1270339200,4,2200,4.55050505050505
4032865,4,B002ZG9788,"If there was ever a film that needed to be remade, then this was it. Sure, the original was good for whoever watched it growing up as a kid in the 80s, but by today's standard the movie is little more than a joke. Fortunately, this film will be relevant for much longer than the original, and Sam Worthington does a much better job than Harry Hamlin.

The story follows the same basic premise of the original, with a few tweaks, so it's still an ancient road-trip movie to save the local princess, except this time the film adds a heavy amount of more motivation for Perceus. This time, he's driven by revenge, and his desire to be more man than God. And in this sense, while the story take a little bit too much of the screen time, and there are lulls, the story does a serviceable job creating a cohesive narrative that moves from setpiece to setpiece. The characters are a bit less serviced, and by the time the movie is finished you only really get to know Perseus. Thus when a character dies, you're a lot less inclined to care, since there's a great disconnect between the emotion of the film and its audience. Thus, for me at least, it was simply about the action.

And the action is pretty good. Since the larger creatures are just so fantastical it was hard for me to get into those scenes as much, but anytime Sam Worthington has a sword I'm happy. But still, the Medusa scene is one of the film's highlights, and apart from the fact that he looks like a sea monster version of Godzilla, the Kraken does provide a lot of great destruction. Plus, it gives the line that will forever live in the annals of film history in, ""RELEASE THE KRAKEN!""

Overall, Clash of the Titans is a mostly satisfying B-movie action matinee, and a great way to kill an afternoon. It may have its problems apart from the action, and I'm not exactly thrilled at a possible sequel, it was a mostly enjoyable two hours, and that's all I can ask from a movie nowadays.",1270339200,4,1951,4.383977900552487
4032866,3,B002ZG9788,"I liked it, but, having LOVED the original 1981 Harry Hamlin version, with creatures by Ray Harryhausen, this movie was a little disappointing.  It was good, but I expected more.  With that said up front, I could not wait to see this in the theater, and of course opted for 3D so the creatures  would stand out from the screen.  The Computer Graphic Imaging (CGI) and Animatronics were great!

The story begins with a seaman opening a box on his ship that he salvaged from the sea  to find a living baby lying inside on its dead mother's chest.  He takes the baby boy home to raise as his own.  Young Perseus quickly advances to about age 25. As Perseus (Sam Worthington), his mother, father, and younger half-sister are on the ship approaching Argos, they see the huge statue of Zeus being thrown into the sea by the people.

Now, let me side-step a minute.  Zeus (Liam Neeson) was the mythological god in charge of the humans. Zeus loved mankind, but mankind was getting a bit tired of honoring the gods all the time and still having to suffer and die.  Zeus also has an evil brother named Hades (Ralph Fiennes) who is in charge of the Underworld.  Calibos lives down there with Hades.

Another side-step is that we find out that Perseus is a demigod (half god and half man).  Zeus came down one day, disguised as Calibos and made love to his queen, impregnating her with a son (Perseus).  King Calibos sealed his queen and the baby in a wooden coffin and they were thrown into the sea.  The baby lived, as we saw earlier, and Calibos went to the Underworld for his crimes.

Back to the story--now the humans have upset their sponsor, Zeus. The sea begins to rise and Perseus' family all perish in the sea.  He is rescued and taken to Argos, where he meets Princess Andromeda and her family.

Back on Mt. Olympus, the Council of gods are having a big meeting.  Hades is just dying to get at the humans with The Kraken, because Hades takes his strength from the people's fear, while Zeus takes his from their love.  Hades says, ""Zeus, can I get after the people?""  and Zeus allows Hades to do his thing because the people have shunned the gods of Mt. Olympus.  So Hades appears in Argos, telling the King he has dishonored the gods.  Either sacrifice the princess to the Kraken in 10 days or Argos will be destroyed.  Perseus and the small army of Argos set off on a journey to find out how to kill the Kraken before the 10 days are up so he can save Andromeda.  Zeus sends his son a few special gifts now and then to help him on his journey, such as a special sword and a black-winged Pegasus.  On their journey, they meet giant scorpions, the jin people, and search for Medusa (whose very gaze turns any living creature into stone.)

This is a neat movie to see in 3D and on the big screen.  It was filmed in Tenerife, UK, the Canary Islands, and Etheopia.

If you have never seen this movie, I highly recommend that you catch the 1981 version, whether you see this 2010 one or not.  If you want both, I recommend you see the 2010 one first.  Both stories follow the same script pretty closely but the 1981 version has a lot more to the story.  I also liked Sam Worthington in this type of action role.  I look forward to seeing him in future action movies.",1270252800,,3260,4.3604651162790695
4032867,5,B002ZG9788,"""Clash Of The Titans"" is great! This is how the story goes: The ultimate struggle for power pits men against kings and kings against gods. But the war between the gods themselves could destroy the world. Born of a god but raised as a man, Perseus is helpless to save his family from Hades, vengeful god of the underworld. With nothing left to lose, Perseus volunteers to lead a dangerous mission to defeat Hades before he can seize power from Zeus and unleash hell on earth. Leading a daring band of warriors, Perseus sets off on a perilous journey deep into forbidden worlds. Battling unholy demons and fearsome beasts, he will only survive if he can accept his power as a god, defy his fate and create his own destiny.

This is a great action film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time. Sam Worthington is on a roll with the films he is doing. This is just as fun as ""300"" (2007) or ""Troy"" (2004).",1270252800,4,3825,5.058637083993661
4032868,3,B002ZG9788,"In ancient Greece, men have started to revolt against the gods, and the gods are not happy about this development.  After a massive statue of Zeus (Liam Neeson) is dumped into the ocean, Zeus' brother, Hades (Ralph Fiennes), takes vengeance on the perpetrators, killing a family of innocent bystanders.  The family includes the parents and sister of Perseus (Sam Worthington), who becomes our protagonist.  Hades (who feeds off the fear and hatred of mankind) convinces Zeus (who basks in the love of mankind) to teach the silly humans a lesson.  Zeus reluctantly agrees, and Hades begins a war upon the Kingdom of Argos.  Only Perseus can prevent the destruction of Argos and save mankind.

""Clash of the Titans"" is a bit silly at times, and like many movies of its ilk, it relies on an overly complicated back story that is related as a prologue.  It's easy to lose interest and get lost before the story even gets started.  However, the story here is not really that important when it comes right down to it.  That'd be the sword fights, battles, and special effects.  For an early summer popcorn movie, ""Clash of the Titans"" is above average.  In particular, the special effects are quite well done without being overly fussy, especially the horrific monster, Kracken.

How does it compare to the original 1981 film on which it is based?  The 1981 version has become a bit of a camp classic, replete with horrible acting and even worse special effects.  However, it's also a rather fun movie (although I haven't seen it since I was a teenager).  I'd say that this new version is less fun but much better directed and acted.  Ralph Fiennes is actually quite good as Hades, even if his role consists mostly of appearing and then dissipating as a cloud of black smoke.  I also liked the character of Io (Gemma Arterton) - Perseus's benevolent protector.  Sam Worthington is not a particularly good action hero for me; he's a bit too bland and boring.  However, he can act rings around the original Perseus, Harry Hamlin.  I'd call the battle of the ""Clashes"" a draw.  I did miss the mechanical owl, Bubo (look fast for his cameo!), but many people will find his absence a blessing.
