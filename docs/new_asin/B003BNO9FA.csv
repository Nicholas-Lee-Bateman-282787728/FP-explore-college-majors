8393814,5,B003BNO9FA,"Great family adventure movies! Fun, exciting, very entertaining and things to think about. Great combinations in both movies of fantasy, adventure, the importance of family and they both give you things to talk about and explore long after you have wathched them.",1472688000,,263,5.285714285714286
8393815,5,B003BNO9FA,"Nice fun movie. I originally saw this in 3D in the theater. This WS edition is very much improved over that. Get the family together, grab some popcorn, and enjoy. That's my review of Journey.. Inkheart was delightful. Imagine reading a book aloud and having the characters come alive. Down side is that someone from our world disappears into the book. In this case the heroes wife. The movie evolves into a quest. Lots of chases, a couple of special effects with the result; a charming wonderful movie. I have already watched it three times and still while watching.",1423612800,,567,4.737373737373737
