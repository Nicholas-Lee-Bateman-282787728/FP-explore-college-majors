8565636,5,B00BC0IP7C,"Known by Native Americans for hundreds of years as a sacred land, Sedona flows from breath-taking natural phenomena to serene panoramic views. Carre Productions captures the broad spectrum of sights and feelings with vivid and well edited videography. In stimulating contrast to Carres first successful video tour through the bustling streets of Paris, our only live encounters in this Sedona tour are a friendly cycler who starts our journey, a wild boar, and a family of wolves. My sole complaint is that certain scenes are so enchanting, I want to stop the tour, hop off my bike and just absorb the beauty of the moment. This seventy minute DVD is great accompaniment to exercising, or to a refreshing break from a stressful day. Try it. You won't be disappointed.",1413072000,,767,4.953488372093023
8565637,1,B00BC0IP7C,I was looking for a video that would help me to push myself as opposed to a recreational ride.  Not much substance in that regard.,1391644800,,130,4.2
8565638,5,B00BC0IP7C,"Wow! I never want to stop cycling when watching this dvd. I haven't even listened to the audio yet. I prefer my own iTunes playlist. But the scenery is fantastic! I just love the red rocks. Hopefully one day I will actually visit Sedona. In the meantime it looks so inviting on my Panasonic 42"" plasma tv. A thousand wows to you Carre Productions! It is top notch quality and smooth as silk. How about Zion and some other beautiful western places?!?!",1388448000,3,450,4.5
8565639,5,B00BC0IP7C,"Sedona, Arizona, is a beautiful place in the United States -- a scenic wonderland that is praised for its spiritual healing powers and a renown resting place for those who seek sanctuary. Visitors, and those lucky enough to reside among the habitat of natural beauty, may find they have found a love that transcends earth herself.  Yet, what most people do not realize unless they have visited this rare beauty is that it is a workout haven for bikers and hikers. For those who cannot visit Sedona in person, ""Carre's Road to Fitness"" transcends other videos for its raw approach to fitness through virtual escapism.  Whether you watch this video while working, for meditative purposes, or while on an exercise machine to heighten the endorphins and physical strength, you will find it is the most gratifying ""Tour de America"" and a trip without actually touring Sedona in person.  The photography/videography is spectacular, the music entrancing, and you truly get the feel of the road without stepping foot (or pedal) into Arizona. ""SEDONA Red Rocks, 'Carre's Road to Fitness' "" is a step into another realm of exercise.  Get pedaling!",1382659200,4,1137,5.0
8565640,5,B00BC0IP7C,"The production values of this ride are terrific, and the ride is through the Southwest's most beautiful canyon.  It's a great video to make the miles and calories go by while ""spinning,"" but it's also something I let play in a corner of my computer screen while writing and working, as it's deeply calming and inspiring.  Where are we going next?",1363219200,3,346,4.655737704918033
8565641,5,B00BC0IP7C,"The scenery is beautiful and the quality of the filming is excellent. The speed of movement is great for biking. The road draws you in, and I can't take my eyes off the road.
Very motivating to watch while exercising on an indoor bike.
The music gives a good cadence to follow, but it can be muted of course.
There is no narrrator or trainer telling you to go faster or slower, so you can make your workout as intense or easy as you want. Personnally, I like to raise the resistance on my bike for the uphills and push my limits. Quickly helped me build up my endurance.
GREAT",1362873600,,576,4.245454545454545
