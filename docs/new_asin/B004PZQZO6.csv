8437827,5,B004PZQZO6,"I love this work out video.  When I'm getting back into working out (like after having a baby) this is one of my go to videos.  Long and Lean is a combination of yoga and pilates moves done with the Bosu.  I've never actually done either of those without the Bosu so can't say how it compares.  This is a great entry level work out that is not hard on the joints and gently builds up your core muscles.  Even with some of the advanced moves, this video may not be challenging for those in great shape.  If you are looking for something more challenging, I recommend Bosu Equilibrium.  It is longer and definitely more of a challenge.  If you are really good with the Total Body Workout that comes with the Bosu, this won't be a challenge at all.  If you feel like giving up on the Bosu because you just aren't ready for the Total Body Workout- this is a great workout to help you on the way.",1453852800,,891,4.194117647058824
