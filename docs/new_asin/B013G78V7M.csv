8727572,2,B013G78V7M,"Someone said, ""I can create a CG fire twister, let's make a film about it.""  Not as good as the shark idea, but it has Casper Van Dien, who hasn't saved the planet in a ""B"" movie in nearly a month. A fire twister is let loose on LA (the facts aren't important) and Scott (Van Dien)  is the only man who can stop it...and that scientist guy (Jeff Clarke).  Scott has a crew of Warm Earthers with him as they drive around in a bullet resistant Ford (The Unstoppable) with the gang that couldn't shoot straight on their tail. Scott is a former LA fireman which means he is part Navy Seal and part chemical engineer.

This film had one of the worst escape scenes I have seen in a long time.

The film is described as ""When a mysterious orb of light strikes a deep water oil rig, the massive explosion erupts into a ball of flames creating a swirling mass of clouds and fire.""

That is not this film.

The kids might like it, or hate you for making them watch it. Made for US TV.",1441411200,,974,4.121693121693122
