6806477,3,B00PHK6KQG,"This pales in comparison to the original On Any Sunday. It lacks the humor, the silliness, and the feeling of getting an inside look at the lives of Mert Lawwill, Malcolm Smith, and Steve McQueen. The photography and slow motion shots are excellent and all the right modern technology was used in the making of the movie. However it's nothing that hasn't been done in many motorcycle documentaries recently. It has none of the groundbreaking feeling of the original movie. Enjoy it for what it is but it's not as special as the original.",1423958400,3,537,4.723404255319149

6806526,4,B00PHK6KQG,"On Any Sunday is a great film for any former or current bike rider. it covers a large amount of racing and it shot in HD. If you like this you should check out the originals too.  the Original On Any Sunday, was a family favorite for years at my house.  if your a fan of motorcycles, former racer. or just love dirt, its worth checking out.",1470700800,,340,4.059701492537314

6806529,3,B00PHK6KQG,"The organization of this film basically follows that of the original, though I found the transitions to be a bit abrupt. The story goes from one form of motorcycle racing to another, and then back again, but does not seem to have an overarching plot or theme that the viewer can latch on to. This movie is great if you are looking to zone out to hi-def imagery of motorcycling, but for something deeper you may want to look elsewhere. This does not capture the magic of the original.",1469232000,,483,4.438202247191011

When this one came out I was not sure if it could match the original but I watched it in the theater when it was released.  It is as good as the first movie.  It covers aspects of motorcycling that weren't around or weren't covered back when the original was released.  A great update to a great documentary.

6806708,4,B00PHK6KQG,This movie was well done but I don't think it was up to the originals depction of the overall view of motorcycling. I may be a little bias toward motocross and there wasn't as much footage or description of the sport I have particapted in and followed since 1963 to present. My wife and I both watch Supercross and end up on the edge of our seats during the winter season and there was no mention of this series at all! We also watch outdoor motocross and used to travel to several races and this rated very little coverage.,1428624000,,524,4.303030303030303

6806744,1,B00PHK6KQG,"Not worth beholding this motorcycle documentary. The narrative style that worked so effectively for Bruce Brown in the original ""On Any Sunday"" and ""Endless Summer"" was lost in this ""sequel"". If you don't understand how important the voice narrative was for the original ""On Any Sunday"", you don't completely understand why it was labeled as the most important motorcycle documentary of its time. Bruce's naturally laid back tone juxtaposed with his enthusiasm for ""extreme"" sports but couldn't be successfully replicated by the ""next chapter"" narrator, Dana Brown. In short, he sounded like a bored narrator. Second, out of all the different motorcycle talent out on the circuit today or the worldwide grueling motorcycle competitions to choose for ""reigniting"" or introducing people to the sport of motorcycling, they chose to pick out these obscure or insignificant riders that made the movie appear like a montage of ""my buddies"" hobbies and interests. Is this what ""On Any Sunday"" was originally doing when introducing the sport of motorcycling to the world? I don't think so. Bruce Brown was catching a ""wave"", if you will, where he was convinced this was the ""next big thing"" in sports. On Any Sunday: The Next Chapter, seems to be looking to keep friends happy and viewers as spectators. Nothing to catch here...",1427500800,,1320,5.144186046511628

6806759,5,B00PHK6KQG,"Fantastic and worthy follow up to the original (and best motorcycle movie of all time, On Any Sunday). Filmed by the son of Bruce Brown, the Brown Family Film Legacy has now become a dynasty. Dana Brown's first major film, ""Dust To Glory"" while covering 2003 running of the Tecate Score Baja 1000, is much more than just a race report. It's a full on adventure film, spanning the many various classes and types of race vehicles, the wide ranging personalities of racers, race support, event organizers, fans, and even the godfathers of desert racing. Much more than a film about an event, it is a film about racing, family, comraderie, and adventure.

This new film, ""On Any Sunday: The Next Chapter"", is a faithful addition to the franchise. It's namesake, Dana Brown's father Bruce Brown's ""On Any Sunday"", set the standard for motorcycle films in 1971, and was nominated for an Oscar award that year. Having grown up on the original (and I dare say my younger brother and I watched our VHS copy daily growing up) and a lover of the film, this new installment is as much a winner for all the same reasons. Just like the original it has coverage of major motorcycle racing events, but rather than focusing strictly on organized competition merely introduces the viewer to the many faces of motorcycle sport.

If you enjoy motorcycles yourself, and perhaps have people in your life that don't, you may be surprised to find them enjoying this film with you. And, if you're lucky, this film may introduce them to a sport they may not have before considered.",1427155200,5,1555,4.713235294117647

This film here, does a pretty decent story of telling the story of some of today's motorcycles. I however didn't like the product placement of red bull, skull candy, KTM and everything else.

6806847,5,B00PHK6KQG,"It's funny.  These reviews reflect what's happened to the industry.  When Bruce Brown and Steve McQueen made the original, there weren't so many factions among motorcyclists.  The same guy who rode or raced motocross also did flat track and road racing.  Hell, it might have been on the same bike!

Today, the world is different and the industry is more fractured.  People who want to see more of, ""their"" version of motorcycling miss the point of both the original and of this film.

This film was intended to shine a light on all forms of love for the motorcycle.  If you love motocross, then stop for a second and pay attention to the people who race MotoGP and see what you all might have in common.  If you're into customs and wanted more of Roland, pay attention to those who ride moto to get vaccines to rural Africa.  You get the idea.

What this film does that is so unique is bring the highest level of all disciplines together to tell their stories.  When have you seen James Stewart, Marc Marquez, Robbie Maddeson, Travis Pastrana all in the same project?",1424822400,13,1067,4.557894736842106

In one part - they play like 60's music (cool) - then later other music that has Nothing (for me) that goes with this.
There is a Lot in here about G.P. racing - which Isn't for me. - Motocross - is more of a mere mention.
They have a part in here about Ashley Fiolek (a young deaf woman's motocross champion) - and I would have liked to hear more about her.
Travis Pastrana is in here - but they caught him while he is injured - and not much about how Great he is.
There are some interesting things - like a cafe racer - that's all electric and Beat the gas powered bikes. - And
how in Africa - someone is saving lives - via a motorcycle (although it still doesn't fit this movie).
Near Nothing about Freestyle Motocross and the Amazing tricks they do. (that's a Major Oops!)
I wish this was a modern-day version of the 1st movie - or just More of the old one - but it's Not.
I picked this up for $10 - and for the parts I like - it's worth it. - As an overall movie - I'd skip it.
I'm sure there is Much more that went into making this movie than I know. - Yet - it just falls short. (Sorry Dana)
P.S. - One of those 'hollow' DVD cases - with like those recycling symbols in it. - Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!",1424217600,3,1459,3.8666666666666667
