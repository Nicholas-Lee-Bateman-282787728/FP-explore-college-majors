1207076,5,B00000FAE9,"I took another chance and ordered this title (again) this week, as ""shipped and sold by Amazon.com.""  By God, Raro actually did it!  They repressed this title and it plays without glitch.  I can now tell you not to hesitate to buy this from Amazon.  Beware 3rd party sellers, however, because there are still LOTS of defective copies out there on the market.",1305676800,3,358,4.634920634920635
1207077,3,B00000FAE9,"I did not like this film very much, but I credit it for being the best adaption  of Oscar Wilde's story so far...  This film takes the story and places it in 70's with all of their vices (non-stop sex with coke and  booze,etc.). Dorian Gray is still young and beautiful Enlgish aristocrat  (so that has not changed).  Helmut Berger seems to be the most suitable for  this role, for he WAS VERY BEAUTIFUL, INDEED.  The plot has changed a  little...which  did not spoil the story, either. But, I gave this film 3,  instead of 4 or even 5, because  despite a basically good script, a  wonderful cast, and  a very original idea, this film neither captured the  depth of Wilde's story nor provided viewers with much entertaiment. While  being a very beautiful Dorian Gray, Helmut Berger is also the dullest one,  and that brings the film down. Basically, this film is a well-thought idea  (placing the story in 70's), executed very badly by the filmmakers.",957916800,4,951,4.632530120481928
1207176,3,B00000FAE9,"After perusing the reviews of other buyers recounting their problems with copies of ""Il Dio Chimato Dorian"", I was, admittedly, somewhat reluctant to purchase the DVD, even after reading that those problems had been corrected.  However, for the price, I decided to take a chance, and I'm glad I did.  The quality of the DVD is flawless, with none of the pixillation problems reported in earlier copies.  Though stylistically, the film is somewhat dated, reflecting the time period in which it was made (swinging late sixties), the (corrected) digital restoration is amazing.

Aside from updating Oscar Wilde's classic to 1960's London, director Massimo Dallamano doesn't stray too far from the source material, although it may seem like it at times.  Helmut Berger, perhaps the most beautiful man ever committed to celluloid, certainly looks the part of the dissolute and ruthless rake, and his performance as Dorian is credible, as well.  His descent from callow youth into real evil doesn't seem too difficult a journey with the estimable Herbert Lom (Peter Sellers' nemesis in ""The Pink Panther"" films) urging him on every step of the way.  Marie Lilljedahl makes a lovely impression as the unfortunate actress, Sybil Vane, whose brief screen time is spent, largely, undressed.  A larger cast of European stalwarts move in and out of Dorian's orbit (and bed) before he gets his comeuppance in the final scene, which divulges from Wilde's novel.

The problems remaining with the DVD are the problems contained within the movie, itself.  At 93 minutes, it still seems too long.  There are slow scenes with characters who just aren't that interesting, while other roles should have been expanded; in some cases, the plot builds up the viewer to expect more than what eventually happens, making it a sometimes tedious and disappointing undertaking. Overall, I think ""Il Dio Chimato Dorian"" is best enjoyed as a period piece (NOT a Victorian period piece) with beautiful looking people doing naughty and, occasionally, unspeakable things to each other, and exhibiting a good deal of skin in the process. I've found much worse ways to spend $12.",1317254400,5,2142,5.126436781609195
1207177,3,B00000FAE9,I recently purchased this dvd. It is a very good quality video transfer. The picture is clear and crispy. I am a fan of the 60s & 70s cinemas.,1316563200,,142,3.9310344827586206
1207178,5,B00000FAE9,"A Great film, and kudo's to RARO Video for jumping on the defective problem and replacing the inventory so quickly.",1309132800,3,115,4.8
1207179,1,B00000FAE9,"I just want to add to the list of people who got ripped off after purchasing this DVD. The image and sound quality are great but when you are seventy minutes into the film the picture pixilates and becomes unwatchable!!! ARRRRGHHH!!!!!!

But, what really burns me is Raro Video's pathetic statement, ""Our suggestion is to return your disc for a refund and repurchase the new disc around the first of July."" Seriously?????????? How about those of us who bought the DVD a month ago or more and have finally got around to watching it??? Let me tell you, we're not getting a refund.

When Anchor Bay released a faulty DVD of Dario Argento's 'Opera,' they posted an address on their site where you could send in the old disc and they would mail you the corrected one. When Panik House released a faulty DVD of `Girl Boss Guerilla' in their amazing Pinky Violence Collection, they did the same thing as Anchor Bay. That was the right thing to do. The audacity of Raro Video placing the onus on the purchaser is ludicrous.

Zelda Lazor, what if you can't return your disc? What would be your suggestion?",1308009600,5,1096,4.581632653061225
1207180,1,B00000FAE9,"I too, have the exact same problem with my DVD - Starting at chapter 17 movie becomes pixellated then unwatchable thru most of the rest of the movie. That said, up until that point I was really into the movie! It is an incredible transfer, the actual movie is shot well and I was enjoying this adaptation.

I just requested my return/refund from Amazon, so we'll see what happens. Hopefully if I get a refund and the posted RaroVideo response on this site is correct - I will reorder the DVD again. I'm Hoping that everyone does their job at Raro and Amazon and gets rid of all the defective stock. I would hate to reorder at a later date and still receive a defective DVD!

Let's hope it all works out. RARO it WAS a superb transfer! Shame about the production defect. Don't be discourged. Roll out a new batch. I'll reorder.",1307145600,4,826,4.392156862745098
1207181,1,B00000FAE9,"I, too, received a defective pressing of this DVD.  Starting at Chapter 17 of the disc, the picture freezes and seldom moves throughout the rest of the film.  The audio continues, but the picture advances very slowly at random intervals, usually landing on a single frame for an extended period of time before moving to the next.  Essentially, the last third of the movie is completely unwatchable.  Very disappointing that Raro Video, a promising new company, somehow released this bad batch of DVDs.",1306627200,,501,5.0
1207182,5,B00000FAE9,"October, 2010: This is a complete reassessment of my previous (negative) review about what was a defective product. When I noticed that Amazon (as opposed to the Marketplace) was carrying this DVD again I figured it was safe to re-purchase it, and I was right. Well, fair is fair, I did get an instant refund and a promise for defect correction, thus my ""new"" review. I will not bother to describe the familiar plot since most folks have surely seen one or more versions of this often told tale.

The print is first rate color and anamorphic, and absolutely tack sharp and at a bargain price to boot ($12-$13). I have bought other Raro Video DVDs and their product merits to be rated right up there with Criterion.

The film itself is a fun 70's romp through a world of ""decadence."" It still keeps the Victorian belief that sexual promiscuity is ""evil."" Berger is perfectly cast as the hedonistic Dorian, while Herbert Lom (as usual) steals every scene he's in as the painter of the infamous portrait. The leading lady does not fare as well in a role that has always proven to be quite thankless, while Italian legend, Isa Miranda, shows up to play an ""older"" rich predator, dripping in diamonds and fancy rags. The film was quite ""scandalous"" in its day, but by now has lost that ""shocking"" sting.

The DVD presents this opus in two languages, Italian (the main track), and in English. Since the film takes place mostly in London and the cast is actually speaking English, I found the Italian track distracting, so I switched to English and it worked better for me.

A highly recommended purchase.",1306281600,3,1598,4.656028368794326
1207183,1,B00000FAE9,The DVD gets stuck at certain scenes throughout the movie. It doesn't play on the computer or in a DVD player. It would have been a great DVD. It even had 1 scene that was not on the VHS version.,1306281600,,195,3.9
1207184,1,B00000FAE9,"I'm just chiming in with the other reviews because my disc is also defective, and in just the same way described by the others. Apparently this problem is across the board, so the best we can hope for is a recall. This is a new, boutique label and I'm hoping they don't go bankrupt first.",1306108800,,288,4.254545454545455
1207185,4,B00000FAE9,"Original release of this DVD was defective.  Raro have fixed this, and the new version is fine.  Quite a nice image for this colorful pop horror film.  This is really a mood piece and not a lot happens if you expect a traditional plot.  Berger is very good as Gray, as is the supporting cast.  In many ways, this feels like a lost Jess Franco film--Harry Alan Towers, Marie Liljedahl, Maria Rohm, Margaret Lee, a sleazy plot, etc.  However, Dallamano is a more traditional director, and so is the film.  Still quite entertaining if you are in the proper mood.",1305763200,4,559,4.53
7907661,5,B00000FAE9,"I could look at Helmut Berger for hours in this film, and the fact that he has many nude and shirtless scenes in this what's not to love lol. Herbert Lom is also like Helmut really handsome in this, and so is Richard Todd. Helmut portrays Oscar Wilde Dorian the best having read the novel as well. I'd polish Helmut's Helmut any day, if you know what I mean ;)",1511913600,,360,4.1571428571428575

7907664,3,B00000FAE9,I can't relieve give this a proper review because the I didn't get to see at least 1/4 of the film; as mentioned by a few others there's a problem with the disk that is still to be fixed. I'm returning it.,1450483200,2,205,3.9047619047619047

7907668,5,B00000FAE9,"Directed by onetime Sergio Leone cinematographer Massimo Dallamano, Dorian Gray is Oscar Wildes Victorian Gothic provocatively updated to Swinging Sixties London at the peak of the Sexual Revolution. Fairly faithful to the novels Faustian plot about a handsome young innocent led down the path of hedonism and debauchery whose portrait comes to reflect the decay of his soul while he himself remains the unsullied ideal of youth and beauty; Dorian Gray is, in every and all aspects, a Dorian Gray that could only have come out of the late 60s.",1363910400,2,543,5.044444444444444
7907669,4,B00000FAE9,"Great drama/horror movie with some racy implied sexual situations, that are very tame compared to the current crop of sexy movies. Its well acted and looks good. Sadly there are many defective discs so i suggest buying used.",1337731200,,224,4.921052631578948
7907670,5,B00000FAE9,"[THE SECRET OF DORIAN GRAY - (1970) - Widescreen Presentation - Directed by Massimo Dellamano - Italian with English subtitles] OK gents, it's time to stop moaning about the dvd problems from the first batch, RaroVideo has addressed this issue, and get on with the merits of the movie and the remastered transfer. The picture quality is absolutely gorgeous, the colors rich and vibrant, so much so they pop out at you constantly, the contrast is bold and the aspect ratio appears perfect. It's nothing short of breathtaking for a 'lost' film released for the first time for home consumption in any format.

The film itself is a mod 60's update of Oscar Wilde's famous story (which is better than any theatrical version yet made - the best adaptation is the 1945 version, 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' starring George Sanders IMO), but the swinging sixties London scenario adds a new touch to the tale. Helmut Berger is cast as the foppish pretty boy who never ages, but has a portrait of himself in his attic that doesn't look so good. Swiss sensation Marie Liljedahl ('I, A Woman', 'Inga' and 'The Seduction of Inga') is his aspiring actress girlfriend who is eventually cast aside as Dorian falls prey to those who gradually corrupt his morals as he climbs a social ladder of conceit and decadence. Herbert Lom is his benefactor and initial prime source of corruption, but soon Dorian becomes his own monster, devouring well-known Euro-lovelies Margaret Lee and Maria Rohm, among other various vixens clamoring for a dalliance with Dorian. Director Massimo Dellamano ('What Have You Done To Solange', 'Night Child' and the original 'Devil In The Flesh') creates a hyper-reality and sumptuous visual feast in lieu of any dramatic embellishments to the story, so no major plot surprises are in store for us, yet it still holds a certain fascination for those who enjoy sixties cinema (even though it was made in 1970, it was still the 60's until 1972 - ask anyone who was there or wrote a book on cinema from that era) and European films. The Great Britain/Italy/German co-production is understandably schizophrenic, but this too adds a psychedelic psychosis rather than detracts, at least it did for me.

The highly-touted sexual aspects of this film are quite tame by today's standards and thus were a letdown; after all, what respectable gent wouldn't eagerly eyeball the luscious ladies listed above in their undraped splendor? There is some nudity but precious little for that era of permissiveness. Overall, the film was still 4 stars for me (others may only deem it 3), but I feel compelled to add the fifth star to counterbalance the many bad reviews the actual film suffered as a result of the initial pressing's defections. Those negative reviews will cost this enjoyable flick many viewers who just see the review stars and aren't aware of the film's unique merits. All fans of a good gaillo and Eurohorror buffs will also enjoy this film, and I hope RaroVideo continues its trend of offering stateside releases of other rare European films in such lavish, remastered presentations.",1317945600,17,3092,4.932821497120921
