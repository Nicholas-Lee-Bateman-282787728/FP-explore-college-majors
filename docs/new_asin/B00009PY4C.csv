1888375,4,B00009PY4C,"An MGM double feature, featuring the first two of four movies in the Ghoulies franchise. Ghoulies involves Johnathan Graves (Peter Liapis), a college student who inherits a family estate. When he finds black magic paraphenalia, he winds up conjruing up the title characters, as well as his long dead dad. Can he stop them? Ghoulies II involoves the operators of Satan's Den, a haunted house for a fair. When the ghoulies hitch a ride by hiding in Satan's Den, they bring big bucks to the fair, until Uncle Ned (Royal Dano) finds out they have killed a couple of the workers. Can he, his nephew Larry, and short actor Sir Nigel Pennywight (Phil Fondacaro) stop them? This also has a scene that delivers on the original's advertising campaign. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the bathroom....
Both movies are low budget films by Charles Band, pre-dating Full Moon Pictures. The cats in both films do great jobs for what they are given. The direction is what you would expect for low budget films. Both films are shown in widescreen anamorphic formats, and look like they have been taken fresh from the lab. the sound on both is great sounding Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono. They are standard releases from MGM, with only trailers, but the low price warrants purchase for fans of the horror genre or MST3K.

1888376,5,B00009PY4C,"MGM has done an admirable job for this new Double Feature DVD. It contains both Ghoulies and Ghoulies 2, both presented in Animorphic Widescreen with their original theatrical trailers. The picture and sound are as good as we're ever going to see these two films on DVD. A great value, even if you only wish to buy it for one of the movies.
GHOULIES was an early release from Charles Band and Empire Pictures, predating the later Full Moon Pictures. The budget was fairly low for the mid-1980's, but it is still an enjoyable late-night film.
GHOULIES 2 was the sequel and probably had a little larger budget. It featured more talented actors (Royal Dano, Phil Fondacaro, Starr Andreeff, Sasha Jenson) and the Ghoulies are a little more animate than in the original movie. On a whole it is better than the original in many ways.
There were two more later sequels (Parts 3 & 4) to the Ghoulies franchise...maybe they will also come to DVD someday soon.",1061942400,4,950,4.660714285714286
1888377,4,B00009PY4C,"These two flicks are personal favorites of mine (Ghoulies 2 is the first movie I remember seeing).  I just got the DVD, and was a little let down.  Why can't MGM dual layer their discs?  Flippers are outdated and pointless.  And how about a printed chapter listing or something?  MGM used pack in a collectable booklet in every disc, but they stopped for some reason.  I do like the artwork (love it, actually), and the transfers are amazing for these films, but that's no excuse for having a flipper.  The low price somewhat makes up for it, though.
Be warned - these are very cheesy, and you pretty much had to be raised on'em to like'em.

1888442,5,B00009PY4C,"Scream Factory delivers another fun double feature blu-ray in which they pair up the 1985 cult classic ""Ghoulies"" and its 1988 sequel ""Ghoulies II"". The original film was a clear ripoff of ""Gremlins"" with a fraction of the budget but still managed to be cheesy 80's fun. Being a success, a sequel was eventually released in 1988 and while even cheesier than the original it also delivered a fun creature experience. Neither are what you would call a good movie but they weren't meant to be. Fans of 80's horror will find a lot to like here. English subtitles are provided for the hearing impaired.

Each film is presented in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio and look pretty good. While it is obvious that no full scale restoration was done for each film and these are both likely older HD masters, the films look much better than their prior DVD releases. No compression artifacts are to be found despite both films and all of the special features sharing a dual layer blu-ray.

Audio is in both 5.1 and 2.0 master audio for each film sounding pretty good and punchy overall.

Extras are as follows:
--- GHOULIES ---
Audio Commentary With Director/Co-writer Luca Bercovici

New Interviews With Executive Producer Charles Band, Composer Richard Band, Actor Michael Des Barres And Special Effects Makeup Artist John Vulich

 I thought the first one was a pretty forgettable movie so much so I'm struggling to remember what happened in it but Ghoulies II is pretty fun with the setting of a circus and them inhabiting a 'haunted house' attraction. It had a 'Funhouse' feel to it and had most of the patrons first assuming the ghoulies were part of the act.

In the second one and old broken down magician in a second rate travelling circus gets the book and reads the spell and the Ghoulies appear and cause havoc and kill teenagers.

1888499,3,B00009PY4C,"Fans of the old mom and pop video stores have found a friend in Shout/Scream Factory. The company has rounded up a ton of the old mainstays of those glory days of the video store, the shelf fillers from the eighties that had fantastic box art on display for some of the lamest movies ever seen. There is indeed a place for these movies yet today, movies that kids from that time loved to no end and long to watch once again. Top of the list are the first entries in the GHOULIES franchise from Charles Bands Empire Pictures. Now both can be found on a blu-ray double feature disc from Shout/Scream Factory.

The first film opens with a satanic ritual being performed by a cult leader played by Michael Des Barres. This was at a time when movies considered this just something frightening and before more practices like this resulted in more serious concerns. As he is about to sacrifice his own child, a protective spell is cast on the baby by his mother. Denied this sacrifice he kills the woman and banishes the child, to be watched over by the caretaker of his property.

Fast forward a number of years and we find the child now grown and inheriting the estate. He moves in with his girlfriend and begins trying to restore the estate. An unease settles over him and he finds the book of spells his father left behind. Caught up in the mysticism and search for power he begins practicing rituals on his own. During a house warming party with their friends there, he tries to summon demons only for it to fail. Or so they think. Once they leave the cellar where they performed the incantation the ghoulies, tiny Gremlin knock offs arrive.

The tiny creatures are not nearly as friendly as their more famous cousins and begin killing off the guests one by one. Interestingly enough, among those is a young Mariska Hargitay. Just what they have in store for our young misguided wizard wannabe is yet to be seen as is who is really pulling their strings. Not literal strings even if they are puppets but, well, you know what I mean.

The puppets on display have a certain amount of charm to them but are extremely simplistic. That was fine for the eighties but my guess is kids of today will be left unimpressed. This is why I say that those who loved the movies back then will remember them with fondness and seek out this blu-ray disc. Some decent acting, some over the top acting, and a fairly well laid out plot make this one passable. Best of all are the unintended laughs when it comes to what an eighties party looked like, including some of the worst hip hop dancing ever filmed.

The sequel, GHOULIES 2, find the tiny critters on the road after a preacher tries to extinguish them in a vat of acid. They come across a traveling carnival with, of course, a haunted house and hide there. The carnival has fallen on hard times and with a new corporate takeover (did corporations really want to take over carnivals?) our bad guy is introduced as the son of the owner, hot sports car and all.

Of course he takes a liking to one of the belly dancers and has an immediate dislike for the one guy she has eyes for, the nephew of the haunted house ride owner. Telling them all that to save money one ride/event must go he lets it be known this is the likely victim. Kids are no longer scared by these things. That is until they walk through to find the ghoulies inside claiming victims. Suddenly the ride is a smash. But the costs in lives of keeping it open past that initial night is soon discovered along with the ghoulies and a battle to save the girl and the carnival from these things is on.

While the satanic rituals may be gone and some early form of CGI used in portions of the film, the campy puppets remain for most of the feature. Its easy to see why this movie was made, an attempt to cash in on the amazing success of the first film. Not only did these two movies make money, they made enough for producer Charles Band to start a new company called Full Moon that went on to fill video store shelves with many more horror and science fiction films like these.

The extras include interviews with Band and more and trailers for each. While the casual viewer might not be interested in these movies the fans of the films will be delighted with the presentation here. Not only will they rediscover memories of the films they enjoyed while kids, my guess is theyll remember those trips to the video store where they perused the box art of movie after movie wondering if the movie was any good or not. Great for a trip down memory lane.

In the end I might have given this two stars if it weren't for the nostalgic value for some.",1433894400,,4639,4.397435897435898
1888500,4,B00009PY4C,"Ghoulies, in my opinion, is one of those movies that you just can't watch too many times :) To be honest, I'm not that big of a fan of Ghoulies II but hey, it came with the CD and if I'm totally in the mood for some B-Movie Horror Flicks, it will certainly do the trick. Always good for Halloween and you can't always depend on Netflix or TV to play them so it's nice to have them available at my fingertips.",1432080000,,408,3.9878048780487805

scream factory have continued their relationship with Charles band by releasing another Empire pictures film on Blu-ray
this time it's Ghoulies & Ghoulies II on 1 blu-ray Disc
both films have been given a new High definition transfer in 1:85:1 widescreen
and i tell you what the picture quality for both films does look amazing, very sharp & clear picture quality
plus the sound quality has been boosted with a new 5.1 Master audio mix plus the original stereo mix has been added to
so for both films you get an option of a new sound boost with 5.1 surround sound or the old stereo mix from the VHS days
personally the 5.1 Master audio mix is much much better sound quality of course.

for the first time ever for both Ghoulies films, new special features
GHOULIES has a new 30mins retrospective featurette FROM TOILETS TO TERROR
only executive producer Charles band, music composer Richard band are interviewed
make up artist John vulich is also interviewed-John was part of John Buechler's team during the 80's
John recalls how the Ghoulies creatures came to be etc
tragically the only Actor from the film interviewed is Michael Des barres who played Malcolm Graves
for some reason, Actor's Peter liapis, Lisa Pelikan, Scott thompson are not interviewed maybe they weren't available
one of the small roles in the film Donna played by Actress Mariska Hargitay is not interviewed either
which is not surprising, Mariska Hargitay plays Detective Olivia Benson on Law and order svu incase some fans did not know that
Ghoulies was Mariska's first film role
very interesting 30min featurette regardless, Charles band has the most screen time
as he tries to recall the making of Ghoulies, filming & marketing Ghoulies maybe he has amnesia problems these days
cause he says during the interview it was 35years ago now so he does not remember every detail how Ghoulies came to be

first time Director of Ghoulies Luca Bercovici was not interviewed for the making of featurette
however he does do a new Audio commentary for Ghoulies
the commentary is boring actually, for the first 15- 20mins of the film
Luca is very informative about how he got the Directing Job for this film
and talks about some of the casting but then there's alot of pauses, long pauses actually
like he's run out of things to say about the film, or he's not interested talking about the film anymore
pathetic Audio commentary, what's the point doing a commentary when you're not really interested
that's the impression i got when listening to his voice
i think he should've done an interview for the retrospective featurette, than do a commentary
as a fan listening to the commentary i thought what's the point of this you're wasting my time
I hate when some cast or crew are asked to do an interview or an audio commentary for a film like this
make the Commentary worth listening to don't waste the fans time
otherwise there is no point doing the commentary
GHOULIES II special features
again another retrospective featurette with Charles band and special make up effects artist Gino Crognale
 only couple of Actors from the film have been interviewed
Actress Kerry remsen recalls lots of fond memories acting in Ghoulies II
how she loved the experience working on the film
Actor Donnie jeffcoat is interviewed aswell
only short featurette this time around 15mins
there's also some Deleted scenes from the film and Theatrical trailer
Charles band's father Albert band was Director for Ghoulies II so of course no new Directors commentary for this sequel

if you love Ghoulies/Ghoulies II, time to upgrade for sure get this new Double feature blu-ray version
worth the money for sure
4 stars for both films, 5 stars for this new blu-ray release",1430352000,3,3781,4.8467492260061915
1888504,4,B00009PY4C,"Scream Factory continues its relationship with Producer / Director Charles Band by releasing their Double Feature Blu-ray edition of Ghoulies and Ghoulies II. Spawned out of the same Gremlins craze Munchies and Critters were birthed from, these two horror / comedy hybrids are B-movie budgetville gold. The two films differ in tone, but both accomplish what they set out to.

The original ""Ghoulies"" centers on Jonathan (Peter Liapis), who was almost killed by his father Malcolm (Michael Des Barres) as a child during a satanic ritual. After being saved and raised by Wolfgang (Jack Nance), who has kept him unaware of his background, Jonathan inherits Malcolm's house and moves in with girlfriend Rebecca (Lisa Pelikan). During a party, he jokingly performs a ceremony described in one of his father's books on black magic, not realizing he has unleashed small, demonic creatures known as ""Ghoulies.""

In ""Ghoulies II,"" the pint-sized monsters hop aboard a traveling carnival, where their violent behavior and grotesque looks are most likely to go unnoticed. There, the creatures find a new home in a haunted house attraction. As they earn their keep by scaring visitors, the carnival finds itself running in the black for the first time in years. But things quickly turn sour when, to the shock of carny Uncle Ned (Royal Dano), the Ghoulies start taking bites out of the customers.

Ghoulies is more serious in tone and plays straight much of the time. However, a group of idiotic partying young adults pave the way for sporadic moments of bad decisions and juvenile hijinks. Ghoulies II takes itself less serious and really finds its stride in its last act. As soon as the little creatures take over the carnival and its rides, deadly mischief and mayhem unfold and hilarity ensues. I found the sequel more entertaining and lighthearted because it seemed like it wasn't taking itself as serious as the original did.

Both Ghoulies and Ghoulies II are rated PG-13 for violence and gore, profanity, alcohol, drugs, smoking, frightening and intense sequences, and adult situations. Apparently theres an R-rated version of Ghoulies II floating around. According to content notes on IMDb, theres not much difference between the PG-13 and R versions.

Many religious folks will be offended by the amount of satanic chanting and magical incantations are found in the first Ghoulies. Im not really a fan of it myself and usually just turn down the sound. The sequel is tamer in that aspect and fully embraces its cheesy and schlocky aspects without as much of the seriousness found in the first film. I do have a problem with the fact that they defeat the little monsters by using dark magic to summon a bigger demon to take them out. I never have gotten the whole concept of fighting evil with more evil.

Scream Factory gives fans a healthy dose of bonus material for the Ghoulies / Ghoulies II Double Feature Blu-ray. Special features for Ghoulies include audio commentary with Director / Co-Writer Luca Bercovici. New interviews with Executive Producer Charles Band, Composer Richard Band, Actor Michael Des Barres, and Special Effects Makeup Artist John Vulich are found in a 30-minute featurette. It also contains a theatrical trailer for the movie.

Special features for Ghoulies II include new interviews with Executive Producer Charles Band, Actress Kerry Remsen, and Special Effects Artist Gino Crognale. There are also deleted scenes and a theatrical trailer found.

Scream Factorys Ghoulies / Ghoulies II Double Feature Blu-ray is a great reminder of what movie magic was like before CGI took over. Just like the Gremlins films that launched these creature features, we get entertaining puppeteering that makes the movie even funnier when humans are attacked and sent screaming in bloody terror. Stop-motion photography is utilized to perfection as well. If you like your Gremlins a little nastier than what Joe Dante and Steven Spielberg served up, youll love Charles Bands Ghoulies.",1430265600,2,3992,5.121351766513057

""Ghoulies"" - As the first film opens we see some sort of cult worshiping Satan, led by a guy wearing a robe and with fantastic hair. A sacrifice is brought forth, and we see that it is a baby boy, apparently the leader's son. A woman runs up, grabs the boy and hands him off to another cult member who flees the estate where the ritual is taking place. Flash forward a couple of decades and the little baby is all grown up, and has inherited his father's estate. Moving in with his girlfriend, the boy finds his father's old cult material, and begins to practice the dark arts, he manages to summon up some booger-covered puppets called the Ghoulies, who manage to cause havoc during a housewarming dinner party. Pure goofy fun, with amazingly awful special effects and puppet work.

""Ghoulies II"" - As the second film opens we see a mysterious man running from robed figures carrying a large bag which contains something which is alive. The man runs to an abandoned gas station, and seeing a barrel full of Toxic Waste, dumps the contents of his bag into it. Unfortunately for him, the toxic waste doesn't harm the Ghoulies which he's dumped into the barrel and instead he gets pulled in and killed. At just this time, an old man and his nephew drive their overheated truck into the gas station. They work at the local carnival, operating the haunted house attraction. The Ghoulies see the oddly painted tractor trailer and decide to hitch a ride and become part of the haunted house attraction. It's not long before the Ghoulies begin tearing up the carnival.

When I first saw this when I was a kid I found it to be very weird. 10 years later it's still an odd movie, but a great odd movie. You've got little ghoulies, midgets, and an ugly undead looking crazy zombie guy. The special effects are great and nothing looks cheap. The ghoulies are very well made puppet creatures. Some of them were pretty creepy looking. One scene that really scared me as a kid was the part when this lady's tongue wraps around this guy. It's a great movie though and just weird. You'll laugh a lot at this movie too. It's mostly about this guy named Jonathan that moves in his dad's old house and becomes possessed then unleashes these little demons and ghoulies. Did I mention there are even midgets lol. If you enjoyed Ghoulies I highly recommend you check out its three sequels they are ghoultastic! I give Ghoulies a 10/10

Ghoulies II is a great sequel to the original Ghoulies. You've got sweet special effects, cool looking ghoulies and a great story line. The Ghoulies escape and go to a carnival and cause chaos. It's got some pretty gory parts too. It's not really scary, but hilarious. It's like a dark horror comedy. Then you've got the hilarious part with a ghoulie that gets a guy when he's on the toilet. This is probably my favorite movie in the Ghoulies series. I highly recommend you check this one out. It's one of those great B movies from the 80's and so much fun to watch. You can get it on DVD with Ghoulies part one for only $10 at most places. Definitely worth the price for such a cool movie. This movie has one ending I never expected too. All around great horror film! As you can see by my username I really like the Ghoulies series.

Upon returning to his family's abandoned mansion, Jonathan realizes he has inherited his father's powers of sorcery, which he uses to unwittingly unleash a handful of demons known as The Ghoulies! The tiny terrors run amok, getting into mischief and killing their unfortunate hosts before Jonathan summons the strength to defeat them. GHOULIES is good old fashioned B-Movie monster fun from Charles Band's early production company Empire Pictures (also responsible for TROLL and other campy classics). John Carl Buechler's creature designs are both creepy and original, even if the cheapness of the latex hand puppets shines through. One can't ignore the similarities between the film and its obvious influence GREMLINS, but it does enough to distinguish its own identity through its dark Fantasy roots in arcane magic. Rather than trying to mask its low budget, GHOULIES revels in its cheesy acting, confusing and pointless plot, and dated special FX. Its greatest faults lie in its weak structure and pacing, two distracting elements that make the first film less entertaining than its sequel. There is still plenty to like for the average B-Movie fan, making this a fun if not silly and stupid 80s sleeper!

--------------------------

Ghoulies 2

The operators of a traveling spook house pick up some unlikely hitchhikers when The Ghoulies begin terrorizing carnival goers at their most recent stop! GHOULIES 2 shows a tremendous improvement over the first film, with the increased budget being reflected in the recognizable cast, improved special effects, and larger setting. John Carl Buechler's new Ghoulies are larger, meaner, and much more mobile; they are also free standing, and no longer show the cheapness of the rubber hand puppets used in the original. Several stop-motion animation shots have also been added to give the creatures more validity as they run amok and get in to all sorts of mischief. While the gore has increased as well, the lighter tone creates a kid-friendly atmosphere, while providing enough laughs and kills to entertain the older crowds. The carnival backdrop is a fun and colorful setting, which provides the creatures with plenty of hapless new victims and brightly-lit attractions to dismantle. GHOULIES 2 is the definitive film in the series, and an enjoyable entry for creature and B-movie fans.

1888595,2,B00009PY4C,"Ghoulies has now become laughably bad.

I remember being 4 years old when this ""horror"" film was created and released.  Back then these kind of films were quite terrifying.  Nowadays they are completely laughable.

The actual ghouls are a joke.  They are nothing but hand puppets, hence the reason you never are able to see underneath of them.  Seriously, some episodes of Sesame Street are more frightening than this stuff.

A young couple moves into a house, and the man gradually becomes obsessed with conjuring puppets... er, spirits.

What a horrible film.  None of the characters even die one by one like in most horror flicks- instead they act completely ridiculous by being goofy, and not in the entertaining way either.

Memories came back to me rather strongly in one scene showing one of the goofy kids spinning around on the floor.  I remember doing that in the 80's and entertaining my family.  The kid doing it in the movie sure didn't entertain me, however.

This is a completely terrible movie.  The only way you can possibly like something like this would be if you happen to have a guilty love for the cheesiest kind of outdated horror stories imaginable.",1268611200,,1173,4.8
1888596,3,B00009PY4C,"With Octoberfest horror film number 14 it was about time to go with a nice creature feature. Having such a huge variety of b creature flicks to choose from we decided to go with somewhat of a cult classic known as Ghoulies from 1985. Really combining many essentials like killer hand puppets, horrible 80's actors, and a couple of dwarfs (considered elves to us of course)is what gave it the green light. Not to mention we believe this had to be the inspiration for the creation of Hobgoblins four years later. So due to this thought we will be taking a different approach with this review by awarding one of these two films king of the killer puppet b.

Ghoulies starts off with Jonathan (who looks like a b Eric Roberts if that's possible) and his lady Rebeca who are college kids. When Jonathan inherits his deceased sorcerer fathers house he takes the semester off to fix it up. Only he finds some black magic books and becomes obsessed with the blacks arts. Long story short, he throws a sweet 80's party and plays a little game with his good time buddies bringing the ghoulies and a couple elf servants out from their dark depths. The rest is filled with b hand puppet action and his father coming back from the dead to take care of biz. Naturally despite the evil Dad's powers, Johnathan and his buddies somehow manage to get through the ordeal to never to be heard from again amongst the film community.

As far as ghoulies goes it was about what we were expecting. Very entertaining especially from the overwhelming 80's vibe going on. There were a handful of dull parts but was pretty fun with moments of boozing, reefer smoking, great possessed green eye effects, elf servants, AC Slater like sunglasses with windshield wiper blades, and very cheap creature action. For anyone to bash it is somewhat ridiculous for the sheer fact of the films basis. You should know what you're gonna get just from the description and cover. Now for who will reign supreme is a tough question. See Hobgoblins is a Sid favorite, but only the MST3K version. If that version goes up against Ghoulies it wins hands down. But to be fair and just take the original films themselves Ghoulies wins hands down for killer puppet b. It was a close race, but the elves gave it the edge.

However since i am a nerd for that kind of stuff, this in my opinion is an overlooked classic. I could barely remember it was really very vague, but i was around six or seven years old and happened to remember bits and peices of 'ghoulies II', for my mum was a lover of cheesey B-movies (i suppose i inherited that trait, my dad hates them). So she rented it in the days of the wonderful vhs when this movie was fairly new. Like i said i remembered bits and peices of the second ghoulies. Well lo and behold i found the two wonderful titles in one package here some 16 years later on dvd and I am so overjoyed I did. Upon watching 'ghoulies II' I was remembering scenes from when I first saw those many years ago. I must say I love it even more as an adult. Though it was my first viewing of 'ghoulies' part 1, I have to say that I thouroughly enjoyed that one as well, I am a huge Michael De Barres fan (from his great MacGyver days as villan Murdoc) and it was all in all a good film. But yes 'ghoulies II is a better film. I believe in my opinion for the first film, they tried a more serious approach and it just didn't work, and the second one they knew that and just went more for laughs, and they succeeded greatly. Watching 'ghoulies II' next, was just great. Every thing this low budget horror/comedy fan could ask for. I ecspecially enjoyed the character of Nigel the dwarf. So in closing, 'ghoulies II' brought back so many memories for me, and I love it even more 16 years later. So if you are new to the 'ghoulies' get this package with parts one and two, i promise you will laugh, love it and will not be dissapointed.",1214179200,,1774,4.130057803468208

1888600,4,B00009PY4C,"Before he created his crap factory, Full Moon Pictures, Charles Band still prefered his horrors in small sizes.  Ghoulies and Ghoulies 2 are enjoyable schlock, but nothing too fantastic.  Maybe it's the fact that they're tongues aren't far enough into their cheeks to be very funny, or that the subject matter just isn't scary.  There are moments of intentional humor, but these films actually seem to be taking themselves a bit too seriously.  The first film is about a poor man's Eric Roberts moving into his satan worshipping father's house.  While there, he gets uncontrollable urges to indulge in satanic rituals and conjure up the Ghoulies.  If the Ghoulies are the most terrifying thing Hell has to offer, we don't need to worry too much.  Ya gotta wonder why he even bothers conjuring them coz all they really seem to do is lurk about and eat his food rather than provide him with the satanic wisdom he craves.  He also conjures a pair of midgets who look as though they belong in a King Arthur film.  All of this builds up to a final confrontation with the resurrected father of the ""hero"".  The Ghoulies are second string characters.  Jack Nance somehow found his way into this.  Also be on the lookout for Detective Benson(Mariska Hargitay) form Law and Order SVU!  This film is pretty fun.  It's schlocky, unintentionally funny at times, and rather morbid for it's PG-13 rating.  Of course this was back when PG-13 actually had some balls.  The second film has the Ghoulies infiltrating a house of horrors at a travelling carnival.  I'm in the minority when I say this actually was fun to watch as well.  Once again the film makers aren't quite sure if they want to make a spoof or a serious scare flick, but it works on a pure entertainment level.  Genre favorites Royal Dano and Phil Fondacaro are along for the ride this time.  And check out the man-sized Ghoulie eating Ghoulie at the end!  Again, these movies are harmless junkfood.

1888623,4,B00009PY4C,"PLOT:

I. Ghoulies (1985): The film begins in the basement of a large mansion on a dark night. A satanic cult is preparing some sort of ritual there. The leader of the cult, Malcolm Graves (Michael Des Barres), unmasks himself to reveal his green glowing eyes. He starts chanting something in Latin and then puts a new-born infant on the altar. Before he can sacrifice the child to Satan, his wife runs up and snatches it, revealing it to be their own child. She puts a protective amulet around the baby's neck. When Malcolm tries to touch the baby, he gets shocked and orders the baby to be taken away forever. One of the cultists, Wolfgang (Jack Nance), takes the baby and gets him to safety. Malcolm then has his wife take the place of their infant son. Wolfgang becomes sour with the whole Satanist thing and decides to keep the young baby, Jonathan Graves, safe from all evil. He becomes the caretaker of the estate and looks after Jonathan as the years go by. Malcolm later suffers a horrible death. Twenty years later, an adult Jonathan (Peter Liapsis) returns to inherit the estate with his fiancee Rebecca (Lisa Pelikan). The place is a wreck but he decides to fix it up. Upon going into the basement, Jonathan discovers all of his parent's old Satanist stuff. He becomes intrigued by the book of spells that he finds. He later gets really caught up with it all and raises the Ghoulies--impish minions from Hell who are sworn to do his bidding. Fortunately, the Ghoulies won't harm anyone as long as Jonathan can control them and keep them out of sight, but what Jonathan doesn't realize is that all of this Satanic magic is slowly beginning to control him!

II. Ghoulies II (1987): The film begins not too long after the events of the first film. A radical Christian has stolen the Ghoulies from a Satanist group and has put them in a large sack. Upon fleeing from the angry cultists, the old man hides in a mechanic's garage. He finds a big metal drum filled with acid and throws the sack in. Afterwards, a winged Ghoulie flies down and knocks him into the acid as well. The man liquifies almost instantly, but the Ghoulies inside the sack were unaffacted by the acid. They go outside and hitch a ride inside a traveling carnival attraction called ""Satan's Den."" The haunted house attraction is owned by Larry (Damon Martin) and his Uncle Ned (Royal Dano). Once they get to the carnival grounds, the son of the carnival's owner, a real dick-head named P. Hardin (J. Downing), tells everyone that any attraction that isn't making enough money will be shut down. Larry and Ned quickly get nervous because the attraction hasn't been doing very well, but suddenly they start attracting a huge audience of people. Every customer that comes out says that the ""little monsters"" are a riot. Uncle Ned thinks that he summonned the Ghoulies with some bogus spell he recited to get business going. What everyone doesn't know is that the good times are about to get very very bad.

COMMENTS: Ghoulies is one of those '80s films that everyone's heard of, everyone's seen the poster for, but hardly anyone has seen. Many people have referred to this as a ripoff of Gremlins (1984) along with other films like Critters (1986) and Munchies (1987). In actuality, the project began in 1983 under the working title Beasties. It seems that the makers wanted the film to be a serious horror film about Satanic cults and black magic, but in the end the things that everyone remembered was the probably unintentional screwball comedy and the Ghoulies themselves, who are actually minor characters in the film. The second film, however, is totally a ripoff of Gremlins. The Ghoulies are now the main characters of the film and the screwball comedy is totally intentional. The puppets used in the second film were a big improvement over the ones of the first film (while at the same time still having the same overall appearance of the original Ghoulies). There is also a scene where the Ghoulies are stop motion puppets, so the audience can see their full bodies walking around. Neither one of these films are that great, but they are just worth seeing because they are so ridiculous. Ghoulies II was later followed by Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go To College (1991) and Ghoulies IV (1994). The Ghoulies look the same in the third film, but the puppets are much larger than in the first two films. The final film tried to take the franchise back to themes from the first film, and Peter Liapsis reprises his role of Jonathan Graves, now a cop out to stop a sorceress who has taken up his old hobby of raising Ghoulies. Unfortunately, the Ghoulies of the 4th film in no way resemble the Ghoulies of the previous films. They're just dwarf actors running around in these horrible suits that make them look like extras from Troll (1986). This DVD contains both of the films in the original widescreen theatrical ratio. Unfortunatle the only extras on the disc are the theatrical trailers.",1149465600,3,4967,4.693807339449541

The first one I found to be a complete snore fest, if the creatures themselves wernt in it I think you'd have the same movie. It seemed to be a movie with some odd demonic creatures not doing anything much.

The second one I could not get into at all, I think it was attempting to be funny, but it failed. It was completly stupid. From watchign it, I guess MGM figured if they tried to sell part 2 on it's own then it would never make any money, but by putting one and two on the same disc then there forced to buy it if they buy the first one.

Why wasn't part 3 included? Part 3 is released on DVD here in regioun 4 land, released by Magna. That was the best one, tho it wasn't much of a horror flick, it was funny as hell.

The films are like the Cabbage Patch Kids Gone Wild, and Green, and some fuzziness too. I'd yet to see a flick where a cute blond picks up a ghoulie thinking it's a doll, and it bites a chunk out of her face, now that would tip me out of my chair.

The second is more of a low budget gore infested flick that is once again a 5 star movie in my book.  The second should not be PG-13.  It should be R no doubt about it.  It is gory with nudity, sex and coarse language.  Anyway, the first Ghoulies is about a young man who has inhareteda mansion.  I curse was put on him and no one knows but his caretaker Wolfgang.  Soon, the affects come in and the young man calls up the Ghoulies.  Ghoulies are ugly little creatures that come out of water and the ground.

The haunted house is a spooky ride called Saten's Den, but it just got spookier since the Ghoulies arrive.  When all the customers go into Saten's den, they ain't coming out.

The casting of Jack (Eraserhead) Nance also helps give it extra b-movie kick, though the actor is largely wasted.  Although rated PG-13, it might get an R in todays climate.  Ghoulies II is a much better movie.  Written by Dennis Paoli (screenwriter of many of Stuart Gordon's movie), the sequel is connected only by the Ghoulies themselves.  A priest steals the demonic buggers from some satanists and attempts to send them back to hell.  He fails and the Ghoulies hitch a ride on a worn out carnival attraction called, ironically, Satan's Den.  The presence of the monsters helps boost customer attendance, but some patrons check it out, but don't come out.  If you get what I mean.  It clearly cost more than Ghoulies to make (shooting overseas in Italy clearly helped), what with the carnival setting, and the giant Ghoulie tearing through it makes it all worth watching.  Both movies look excellent, but only Ghoulies II can be considered close to good.  Fans of Charles Band's output during his all to brief reign as Studio Chief will probably want this in their collections (I know I did), but fans of good and/or great movies...well.",1072137600,4,1887,4.710365853658536

Id highly recommend this double feature to anyone whos a fan of the 80s horror/comedy genre. I should also mention the picture and sound is GREAT! Scream Factory never disappoints!

Id also highly recommend the TerrorVision/ Video Dead double feature as a very close 2nd to this one.",1521158400,,421,4.467532467532467

I have been going back and forth for years to buy these movies, either I ran acroas another I wanted to own or something new was being released that I wanted, but I finally gave in and bought these and I'm so glad I did. Watching them again I remembered how fun 80s cheese is, at least for me. My 80s DVD collection looks pretty good these days with over 500 movies and 75% being 80s gems. No special features other than trailers but the movies look and sound great",1519776000,,579,4.225225225225225

see any Oscar-worthy acting in ANY of the four films in this franchise.

can relive in your home. Also recommended to schlock-fans everywhere is #4.

The only reason I gave this two stars is because it's advertised as Multi-Format. That usually means it comes with a digital code. This didn't. I still kept the movies because it's one of those things that just bring you back when puppets were scary.",1506556800,,480,4.528735632183908
