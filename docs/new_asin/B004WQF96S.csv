8445583,1,B004WQF96S,"The dialogue is awkward at best.  While attempting to make up for the lack of chemistry between the main characters, it serves to solidify your disbelief in their ""love"".  Not worth the rental fee.",1330387200,,197,4.764705882352941
8445584,5,B004WQF96S,"I've read some overly critical reviews of this movie on other sites, but I found it endearing.  If you're looking for slapstick humor or fast paced action, don't bother to even take this DVD out of its case.  ""Redefining Love"" is more of a quiet, contemplative film.  As a story that mimics the often heartbreaking experiences of the everyday life, it's ideal for the romantic at heart.  Ryan Small is loveable and familiar in his secondary role, and Jodie Sweetin offers a reprieve from the occasionally underacted main characters.

Still, the real strength of this movie lies in the writing.  First timer B.J. Smith has delivered a relatable story exploring the pitfalls and triumphs of love and friendship.  ""Redefining Love"" is far from perfect, but it offers a sweet, honest, and hopeful look at relationships, and given its budget and time constraints, it's a solid film.  Overall, superb script and an excellent supporting cast.",1304380800,3,935,5.025974025974026
