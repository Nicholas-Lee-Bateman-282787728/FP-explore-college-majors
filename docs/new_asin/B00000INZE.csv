7911164,4,B00000INZE,"This first volume of highlights from the German television program called 'Musikladen' is a guitar lovers dream.  Deep Purple's Ritchie Blackmore opens things up, playing wicked lead chops to supplement Ian Gillan's scorching vocals on one of the Deep's finest compositions, 'Machine Head's 'Highway Star'.  Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull follow with the weakest song on the tape, 'With You There To Help Me'.  While the track is obscure, and features a lengthy, avante-garde flute/piano coda, it does highlight the formidable instrumental talent within the band.  It's also a rare opportunity to witness Anderson's animated vocal delivery, and unparalleled utilization of Anderson's flute virtuosity, with Tull in their prime.

For the remainder of this 30 minute tape, we're back to guitar heroics.  Two three-piece rock ensembles follow, beginning with a rare glimpse at Joe Walsh and The James Gang performing one of their three standout tracks, 'Walk Away'.  Walsh has a bit more difficulty carrying this band than Eric Clapton did with Cream, but the performance is weighted with heavy riffs and intense, heartfelt vocals.  The surprise performance of the night is turned in by Johnny Winter, whose three-piece assemblege delivers a tasty blues-rock number titled 'Mean Town Blues'.  Winter is up to the task of carrying this band, offering slick and meaty extended lead guitar solo's and gritty vocals.  Carlos Santana and his band wind up the collection, offering a faithful rendition of the classic 'Black Magic Woman', with Greg Rolie on vocals.  Whereas Walsh and Winter extend their emotions through their instruments, Santana is more of a technician, displaying an agility and precision few axemen could muster.

The early 1970's was certainly a fruitful time in rock history, and we're fortunate The Beat Club (as 'Musikladen' was originally titled) gave artists the opportunity to be filmed for posterity.  Lord knows mainstream television in the states was still skittish about airing such cutting-edge performances.  Unlike Volume 2 of 'The Best of Musikladen', the filming of these performances is quite straightforward, with only occasional use of psychedelic graphics.  In this case, the only drawback to the cinematography is a shortage of close-up images, especially with Johnny Winter's astounding guitar work.

While a complete set from Santana is available under the 'Musikladen' banner, only these individual tracks are currently (as of May 24th, 2005) avaiable from Deep Purple, Tull, Walsh, and Winter.  If you're a fan of rock music from the late 1960's and early 1970's, you would be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable set of performances than this diverse, even historic collection.  Four stars only because the Jethro Tull selection isn't the best, but even that isn't a wash by any means.  Well worth the few dollars invested.  Buy and enjoy.",1116892800,,2876,5.306843267108167
7911165,4,B00000INZE,"This is my second review of the same tape.  The first copy that I purchased, the sound quality was terrible.  The producers of this tape sent me a new one, and I sent them back the bad copy.  I retract all my  statements from above except that my choice for Jethro Tull would have been  something a little more recognizeable like ""Aqualung"",  ""Locomotive Breath"", or ""Wind Up"" not ""With You  There To Help Me"".",938304000,6,410,4.45945945945946
7911166,2,B00000INZE,"Who ever the video production company was that made this piece of ""hoop"" did a terrible job.  There are various annoying ""pops"" and ""clicks"" through out the entire video.  Sounds like a really old 35mm film that's been played too many times.  Highway Star by Deep Purple.  This version of the song must have been  recorded when Ritchie Blackmore(lead guitarist) and Ian Gillian(vocals)  were feuding.  Not a good way to promote Deep Purple. Jethro Tull &  Johnny Winter weren't half bad, but Carlos Santana's Black Magic Woman was  cut off before the song was done. The credits state the video was made from  a DVD.  Obviously the engineer who made this conversion was more interested  in the almighty dollar then in the ""quality"" of the product.",936489600,10,746,4.833333333333333
