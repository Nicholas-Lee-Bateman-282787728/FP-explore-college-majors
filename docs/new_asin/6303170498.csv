The movie sets and special effects are hilarious, the acting is sad and the plot weak. To really appreciate this movie and it's director Ed Wood, you must first watch the 1994 movie ""Ed Wood"" staring Johnny Depp. Gives you so much more appreciation of this flick, it's director and how it came into existence.",1477958400,,423,4.435897435897436
592333,5,6303170498,"One of the most incredible examples of a directorial train wreck to ever come out of Hollywood....or anywhere for that matter. If you don't know who Ed Wood was, stop....Go no further. Take some time, do a little homework and read up on Mr. Wood. Plan 9 is one of the wildest examples of taking a story, figuring that the audience knows most of it and the director skimming over the rest. Bella Lagosi died during the filming so, for the most part, you'll see his double walking around with his cape up to his face, ala Dracula. Tor Johnson does what he did best, hulk around, being huge and not saying much. Vampira,  well, I'll let you figure out her part as she really just walks through the brush.....a lot. Overall the plot....there was a plot? I don't remember it. There's narration in the beginning and end. Everything else in between is the sauce...bechemel, A-1, McDonalds special sauce ? That's the point. This movie is a cinematic mess, a nightmare, a hallucination from the mind of Ed Wood. Don't take it seriously, just relax and critique the heck out of it. Why? Because it's there, that's why and if you remember the storyline after you've watched it please post it.

592408,5,6303170498,"I bought a Blu ray for myself that I'm over the moon about. I love the entire story around this film, it's director, it's actors, and just why it's been around for this long. Perhaps because Ed Wood loved directing and making movies. Loved it. Most of you know it as the worst movie ever made. That said, why do we love the kind of horrible this movie is? Why do we love seeing Tor Johnson kick the cardboard headstones? Why do we want to spot the moment the replacement actor steps in? Why? It's honest. It's an honest attempt to make an honest science fiction/horror film by a dude that wanted nothing more than to make movies. Can you imagine the love you must have for something to hand paint all the hubcaps and back drops and props you must have for this? That love transfers directly into the fiber of Plan 9 From Outer Space. I adore this movie and even though it's known as the worst movie ever made, it's one of my all time favorite movies. I've actually never seen it in color, and this version has the colorized version and the restored version. Officially Bela Legosi's last movie as he died whilst making the film, there's a somber underlying tone away from the rest of the movie, especially if you know about his morphine addiction.

592469,5,6303170498,"Plan 9 from Outer space is considered to be the worst movie ever made by the worst director in history, Edward D Wood. Now this movie is so bad that it's actually good. As a matter of fact, I would consider to be great. Now at the time, Edward T would consider this movie to be a masterpiece and thought the audience would love it. They did not. But if you want to watch a science fiction movie that is so bad that it is good by a director that was probably delusional, but certainly well-meaning, then this is the movie for you. So grab some popcorn and sit back and watch movie history. You will not be disappointed. I gave this movie five stars because there is simply no other movie like it. It's ineptness is almost beyond comprehension. The dialogue, not meant to be funny, is beyond hilarious. So if you're occasionally into really bad movies, this is a must-see. The worst movie ever made. There is nothing in it that children cannot see as there is no sex and only implied violence. So get together with the ones that you love and watch moviemaking history. I personally recommend not eating while watching this movie, or putting it on pause while chewing your food. Then restart the movie. Why, because this movie will make you laugh when you least expect it. It was not meant to make you laugh, but you will. And you will never be the same after watching it. During an episode of the X-Files, Fox Mulder confided to Dana Scully that he has watched plan 9 from Outer space 62 times. Of course this is a fictional television show, but I did find that cute and funny.",1470009600,,1575,4.378839590443686

Filming is bad, plot is horrid, the actors don't speak half the time (guess they couldn't pay them to speak) and all you want is the movie to end. Thank goodness for FF!. Kinda feel sorry for the actors - I wonder if they were told it was going to be a much better show than it actually turned out to be.

592472,5,6303170498,"Often cited as ""the worst movie ever"", I find Plan 9, and all Ed Wood's movies, to be less awful than most will...in fact, once one gets acclimated to the rather ""organic"" film making process Wood deployed (a wing and a prayer in popular vernacular) they are rather enjoyable...Wood not only asks, he expects his audience to suspend their disbelief for the duration of the film, ignore the obvious sets, and just watch him tell a story...so what if the cockpit of an airplane is just two guys sitting with some yoke-like apparatus in their hands in front of a curtain...you know it's supposed to be an airplane cockpit, so why get bogged down in the details? Really worth another look, especially when one knows something of the backstory of this movie. If nothing else it serves as a cautionary tale to our children...ambition without talent, and talent without a plan gets you results like Plan 9 From Outer Space...Edward D Wood Jr had ambition in spades, but little else.

592610,4,6303170498,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version (Colorized) of 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' by Legend Films

There is not a whole lot that I can say about this movie that hasn't been said before but nevertheless I will give my review of the movie itself and of the Blu-Ray DVD.

BLU-RAY DVD: The picture quality is quite good and enjoyable to watch. The color is at times good but has problems. There are several times throughout the movie that you will see colors that are way off what they should be. Especially noticeable is the skin tone in several scenes that for moments will appear nothing like skin tone. But overall I am quite happy with the results.

EXTRA'S : You also get the Black & White version of the movie which I did not watch. There is also a commentary track by Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame. I did not listen to this either. What I did watch was the Pop-up trivia which gave quite a bit of information. I actually enjoy watching the movie this way as opposed to commentary tracks. With a commentary track you usually cannot hear the dialogue but with the trivia notes flashing this is never a problem.
There are some old commercials that are filmed by Ed Wood.
Finally you get a couple of minutes of home movies of Ed Wood including a rather bizarre one of him dressed as a woman.

PLOT/SUMMARY: The movie opens with Bela Lugosi mourning his dead wife at home and at a cemetery. His dead wife is played by Vampira. Shortly thereafter she rises from the dead and spooks the two gravediggers (who helped finance this movie!). Meanwhile pilot Jeff Trent (Gregory Walcott) sees a flying saucer. This will be the first of many times we see up to 3 flying saucers being held obviously by a string. The old man wanders off screen and we hear a ridiculous yell and we are told that he has been killed by a truck. Inspector Clay (Tor Johnson) along with a few other officers go to the cemetery to investigate the reports of dead people or vampires wandering around. Inspector Clay is killed while off by himself. When Lieutenant Harper finds the body and says the infamous line ""Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebodies responsible!"" We see a battle using stock footage of the military. They are firing at the flying saucers that are hanging by strings. The military is being led by Col. Tom Edwards. We have scenes of the aliens, Eros, Tanna and the Ruler discussing conquering earth. Apparently they want to stop earthlings from destroying the universe. They claim any more advancement on our part will lead to the destruction of the solar system. Their plan is to raise the dead just so that we will believe in them if that makes any sense. Of course everything in this movie is ridiculous so there is no point in elaborating on the stupidity or logic of the plot. It's up to our heroes to stop the aliens from destroying us.

PRODUCTION: If you are reading this, you obviously know about the production values of this movie. Of course it is the reason this movie is famous and still watched repeatedly.
The scenes of Bela Lugosi (billed as Old Man) along with a few scenes later in the movie of Bela rushing into and out of the woods in a vampire costume are the only scenes with him in it. These scenes were shot for another movie in 1956 called 'The Vampire's Tomb.' This movie was never completed as Lugosi died in his sleep before most of the movie was made. Ed Wood, not one to waste film footage incorporated these scenes into 'Plan 9.'
Vampira had her show cancelled prior to the making of 'Plan 9' and Ed Wood used this as an opportunity to get her in his movie.
The flying saucers, subject of much speculation, were models bought in a toy store by Ed Wood.
The term 'Plan 9"" apparently is derived from the fact that the aliens had made 8 other attempts to conquer the earth.
The sets were among the cheapest ever devised for a movie. We have a grass carpet that moves around and has an actor trip over a fold. We have cardboard tombstones that are kicked and knocked over. There is a tiny crypt in which too many people come out of. An alien spaceship....well the less said the better.... An airplane cockpit with a shower curtain, etc. etc.
The vampire covering his face just looks stupendously stupid. He can't even see when he's chasing the girl around, who incidentally runs from a bed that has changing pictures above it! Ed Wood didn't even bother shooting a second take when the vampire's cloak fell off and he had to reposition it.
Years later Vampira would go on to sue Elvira for stealing her look.

THOUGHTS:  I don't think this movie is as 'laugh out loud' funny as many others do. For sure there are a few moments that are funny. But mostly it's just poorly directed with poor writing and poor production values. I have found ;that what really makes bad movies funny is the acting. Bad acting can ruin any film even those with good production values. Plan 9 actually has a few decent actors in it. People that appeared in many films over the years such as (obviously) Bela Lugosi, Gregory Walcott the pilot,Tom Keene as Tom Edwards (his last movie) and John Breckinridge (The Ruler).
'Plan 9' was originally supposed to be called ""Grave Robbers from Outer Space"" which would have made more sense but then again it might have made the movie a bit less 'legendary' with that title.
Interestingly enough, Ed Wood does let some of his political views slip through in the dialogue.

THE DECISION!: Is 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' the worst sci-fi movie ever made or the worst of any genre? Well in my view, it's close but no cigar. I still rank ""The Beast of Yucca Flats"" as worse. Also, Manos: The Hands of Fate is definitely worse but I consider that horror and not sci-fi. But that is just one man's opinion.

Recommended obviously for 'Plan 9' fans and 50's sci-fi fans. You get color and some interesting extra's and a nice print.
Only bad movie afficionado's should be watching this to begin with.
If you are new to classic sci-fi and picking this to be your first 50's sci-fi movie to watch then you are making a big mistake. Watch something else.",1464134400,3,6099,4.497292418772563

592875,4,6303170498,"This review pertains to the Blu-ray edition of ""Plan 9,"" released by Legend Films. Yes, you heard that right - the alleged ""worst movie ever made"" has been released in a restored version, in the most technologically advanced format available. I found it hard to believe, too!

Anyway - I'm happy to report that Plan 9 looks nicer on Blu-ray than I anticipated. Since Ed Wood filmed Plan 9 on the cheap, I feared it would look grainy and dreadful on Blu-ray. And indeed, parts of the film have poor quality, including Criswell's opening monologue. More often, however, Plan 9 looks decent in this format. With the clarity of Blu-ray, I was able to enjoy details that were hardly visible before, such as the wrinkles in the film's many cloth backdrops, and those strings holding up the flying saucers. Also, this print ruthlessly exposes that Plan 9 was cobbled together from multiple sources -- the stock footage, the early Lugosi footage, and the later main-feature footage all look different! But of course, spotting the clumsy seams in Plan 9 is one of the joys of watching it.

The special features, meanwhile, are halfway decent. The film is presented in both a colorized version (which is okay, but I basically ignored it) and the original grayscale. Optional, pop-up trivia subtitles provide insight into the film's production. Meanwhile, Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) fame provides a mocking commentary. To be honest, I have mixed feelings about the sarcastic style of MST3K, so I found Nelson's commentary half enjoyable and half annoying. Still, he slips in a few great jokes. Rounding out the features, you get an Ed Wood home movie and some hilariously bad commercials that he directed. It's not a great package of features, but there's enough here to pass an amusing hour or two.

As for the film itself...Plan 9 has a well-deserved reputation as one of the best bad movies ever made. Thanks to its wooden dialogue, hilarious fake sets and daft special effects, this film is a real treat for lovers of Z-grade cinema. However...Plan 9 also features a strangely thoughtful message, condemning the Cold War arms race, and interestingly enough the director's sympathies are clearly with the alien ""villains"" instead of the human ""heroes."" So, in addition to being a hilariously bad movie, Plan 9 is an unusual and surprising one. Also, I enjoy the way the plot blends different genres -- it's part sci-fi, part horror, and part police procedural, with a bit of daft romance and zombies thrown in.

In short, they don't make 'em like this anymore. Which is why this Blu-ray is a welcome release. In the words of the Ruler, the results should astound those watching...",1452384000,3,2697,4.894967177242888

593022,5,6303170498,"""Can you prove it didn't happen?"" Criswell implores us, and we must confess that indeed, this movie did happen. Ed Wood trots a cast comprised mostly of his friends, and their friends, around the star, Bella Lugosi passed away early on into filming. Ever resourceful, Ed was only temporarily set back by the death, and found a way to be brave and carry on. The plot isn't thin, it's an intertwining of about six ideas done with a tone-deaf flare for believable dialogue. Does it hold the cast back? No, they are on the same level as the plot, props, pacing, and production values. The touching ""over there"" speech by the pilot's wife, vies with Dudley Manlove's (as an alien) ""Stupid! Stupid"" speech/tantrum. So sparkly, yet so temperamental! Tor and Vampira look like zombies, and the 6ft tall chiropractor who helped stand in for the petite Bella Lugosi, somehow all work together in a chaotic fashion.

Vampira however looks fantastic in it and is found in many of her trademark moves/poses she is famous for.

593257,4,6303170498,"Believe it or not, films exist which are not nearly as entertaining and amusing as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". The film begins with one of the most ridiculously silly monologues in film history, its opening line so dreadfully obvious that I crack up every time I hear it: ""We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives."" A filmmaker trying to consciously make a silly film could not come up with something so cheesy that it truly is ""reverse genius"". You had to believe you were a genius to make something so bad it's good.

Only Ed Wood who was in love with everything he did in film and convinced of his own brilliance didn't know how bad his projects were. Apparently, he truly believed he was a great filmmaker. However, only a bad filmmaker who thought he was a great filmmaker could make drivel so unutterably inane that it is actually entertaining and works but not for the reasons intended by the filmmaker. If Wood had tried to make the film ""better"" it would not be nearly as entertaining. The production of ""Plan 9"" was truly awful but the people involved didn't really appear to notice, least of all Wood, which is what makes it so fun to watch the finished film. Ed Wood became the only filmmaker who made schlock into a new and unparalleled art-form, bad cinema for its own sake!

What makes Plan 9 fun is not the story which is completely incomprehensible, not the acting which is absolutely atrocious, and not the silly flying saucers which look like Frisbees painted with silver with little hubs on the top. (In some scenes you can see the strings!) Even the wobbling tomb stones are not enough to make this watchable but certainly add to the charm. What makes Plan 9 the wonder of wonders is the dialog, which is so painfully ridiculously it is absolutely 100% entertaining. Nearly every line is a laugh. I don't know if you could make dialog this funny unless you didn't know how to write good dialog! Take for instance these lines:

Colonel Edwards: This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard. Jeff Trent: And every word of it's true, too. Colonel Tom Edwards: That's the fantastic part of it.

or

Lieutenant John Harper: But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebody's responsible.

or one of my favorites:

Paula Trent: I've never seen you in this mood before. Jeff Trent: I guess that's because I've never been in this mood before.

The lines are so over-the-top they are unpredictable, unexpected clich which makes you take notice. Screenwriters are taught to avoid clich, so I guess when it happens at this magnitude it is quite startling. You can't help bursting in on wave after wave of laughter which never ends. I have watched this movie several times, about every 2 to 3 years, and the lines always surprise me yet again, usually because I have forgotten most of them. This movie never ceases to entertain, although there are parts that aren't quite so bad, just dumb, and those I have to fast-forward through. There are times when the 78 minutes seem longer.

Maybe ""Plan 9"" really is pure genius. Maybe the whole joke is on the audience who thinks the movie was intended as a serious SF thriller with an anti-war message, but it wasn't. Maybe Wood knew what he was doing all along, but I doubt it. You can't know what you're really doing to make Plan 9 do what it does! Does that make any sense? The closest analogy I can come up with is Jay Leno's ""Headlines"" on the Tonight Show. Newspaper headlines (outside of yellow journalism) are not meant to be funny, which makes them more funny when the wording turns out to imply things which weren't intended. This is the essence of Plan 9. The intention, apparently, was a serious SF thriller but the results are a laugh-a-minute. Not even John Cage could come up with something this crazy.",1433808000,2,3857,4.578260869565217

When the seriousness of world events or personal trials and tribulations get me down, I can always turn on Plan 9 and it has me smiling and engaged within minutes.  As I'm getting older, there are times when I have insomnia.  If I'm lying down, I can always count on Plan 9 to put me into a deep sleep about three quarters of the way through the film.  Plan 9 from Outer Space is like an old friend I always enjoy visiting. ",1422835200,4,587,4.052173913043478
593496,5,6303170498,"I waited decades to see this famous film and was lucky enough to get it on Blu-ray.  Plan 9 From Outer Space is everything everyone has decried and more.  It's sheer genius, the perfect example of something being so bad it's good.  In this case, it's great.  It was well worth the long wait.  I've slogged through some bad films in my life but nothing of this magnitude.  Wow.

Plan 9 primarily deals with a couple of conspiracies.  On one hand, the government is hiding alien existence from us while the aliens, loathed to be ignored, plot to destroy this upstart world because we're ignoring them and their dire warnings to stop making bombs (I don't think they were referring to this film in that regard).  To that end, they resurrect three dead bodies, Bela Lugosi (in part) as the `old man,' his dead wife (Maila Nurmi), and Inspector Clay (Tor Johnson).  These animated corpses wander around a cemetery set (at times you can see their shadows on the `walls' of the night).  What little of Lugosi is featured is repeated several times and was shot for another proposed movie.  The rest of his scenes are done with a stand-in.  Neither has any dialog.  All the sets looked to be made of cardboard with a lot of curtains covering everything.  There's an unfortunate time element at play throughout the movie (it's day and night in some scenes!).  For all that, it breezes along at a snappy pace.  The dialog is hilarious.  (When the inspector is killed, they all agree he was murdered ""and someone is responsible!"")  How can you argue with logic like that?  I especially loved the final denouncement in the saucer, when the alien Eros (Dudley Manlove) berates his guests, you have juvenile minds, and you're stupid!  And then he tells them how to make a solarbonite bomb the aliens don't want the Earth dummies to know about.

Being this incompetent is a gift.  Ed Wood's was a genius.  I absolutely love this crappy movie.  It's stellar.",1422835200,8,1941,4.654867256637168
593497,5,6303170498,"Plan 9 may or may not be the worst movie of all time, but my take is that the reason it's such an enduring classic is because many things are right with it: atmosphere, colorful characters, etc. Say what you will about Plan 9, it's seldom dull, and for this viewer anyway Plan 9 isn't conspicuously inferior to comparable low budget horror/sci-fi movies of the era. Mostly, and for all its technical flaws, it's just a wonderfully entertaining movie and a good showcase for some headliners of the day, and a good representative of 1950s sensibilities. Ed Wood's heart was always in the right place, even if he lacked the talent. Five stars, for sheer entertainment value.",1422489600,2,671,4.743589743589744

Great riff - iconic movie, can't go wrong. Id reccomend the Live version (and blu ray - its woth the extra 4-5 bucks) over this but this is convient because its available on Amazon instant (and the only out of the original releases on Amazon Instant to be a Three Riffer - not even sure there was a mike-only for plan 9).",1395619200,,1033,4.529411764705882

Plan 9 From Outer Space was the last movie Bela Lugosi made.  He died when this movie was being filmed.  Ed Wood loved Lugosi and persuaded him to be in this terrible movie.  After he died the rest of the needed footage with Lugosi was shot with a substitute that walked around with a cape like ( Dracula ) across his face so everyone was to believe it was Lugosi.  This movie is just fun to watch because it is so very bad. This movie also had Vampira as a cast member,all she did was walk and stalk and just look scary but her shape, her body was just so sexy.  I would suggest that you watch the movie ( Ed Wood )then watch Plan 9 From Outer Space ).  It will make your day and give you truly a great laugh.

Every actor is pitiful(except my boy Lugosi), every set for the scenes looks poorly done, every line is corny and poorly said, every thing in this movie is horrendous! That's what makes it so damn good! They replay the same scenes over and over again because I suppose they couldn't get more material, the same scene of Lugosi walking in the graveyard and turning around, the same car driving down the street scene, the same flying saucer scenes. It's hilariously awful.

Now for the release. The colored version was nice to watch, good to see it in color even if it does look a bit funky. I personally think they did a decent job of colorizing the movie. Some re-colored movies leave backgrounds in black and white and other little things not in color, but this version seems to have every detail colored in which is nice. Sure some of the coloring is bright and gives it a halo effect, but not that bad. The black and white version looks touched up as well and enjoyed that one too.

For the colorized version, in the scene where the character of Mrs. Trent is woken up by a phone call from Mac, suddenly a new picture appears on the wall in back of her.  For a couple of shots, instead of what looks like the small landscape that's there at the beginning of the scene, someone has inserted a photo of a man and woman.  And instead of using the soft pastels the rest of the film has been colorized with they've gone for almost neon bright colors.  Kind of glaring.  They also haven't done that great a job inserting it since it almost looks more like it's hovering over the bed instead of placed on the wall.  it's there for a shot or two, then goes back to the original painting for the rest of the scene.

As soon as I heard those words, I was hooked.  As L. Phillips from the Movie Discussion Forum told me, ""A more perfect opening line for a movie has never been written.  You know exactly what you're in for.""  I had heard of Ed Wood over the years, but never bothered to watch any of his films.  I'd like to thank Ahmad and L. Phillips, who convinced me to give this one a try.  Be aware that this movie is not for everyone.  If you don't like films that are ""so bad they're good,"" do not buy this.  The entire movie, both B&W and colorized, is available on youtube.  I'd recommend giving it a view before buying (this is what I did).

A/V quality of this 4x3 transfer is not pristine, but seems decent enough to me.  The disc includes both the B&W and colorized versions.  Myself, I'm partial to the color.  I think it gives the film more impact.

The plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese; the acting is as wooden as a totem pole; and the sets and costumes look as if they were stolen from a West Hollywood yard sale.  But despite all these things, or perhaps because of them, I liked this movie.  Ed Wood suffered the unfortunate fate of many artists: his work was never appreciated until after his death.  In the end, he has achieved success, albeit posthumously.

The disc has four special features.  The first two are the weakest: some of Ed Wood's home movies and TV commercials.  I'd ignore these, unless you're a hardcore Ed Wood buff.  But the next two I strongly recommend: commentary by Mike Nelson (of MST3K and RiffTrax fame), and the pop-up trivia subtitles.  The former is hilarious; the latter is very interesting.

Some of the better dialogue:

Colonel Edwards (in charge of Saucer Field Activity): ""Well, they must have a reason for their visits.""
Captain (unnamed): ""Visits?!? That would indicate visitors!""

General Roberts (to Colonel Edwards): ""Atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting.""

Eros (to Jeff and several police officers): ""Stronger? You see?!? You see?!? Your stupid minds! Stupid! Stupid!""

This is film isn't ""good,"" in the traditional sense of the word, but it's entertaining. If you're already a fan of the B-movie genre, there's no getting around ""Plan 9;"" it's a must-have. If you're just curious about the whole ""so bad it's good"" thing, there's no better place to start.",1387497600,5,2598,4.6381578947368425

Overall both the colorized and the B&W are a definite improvement over a DVD in resolution contained in the transfer.

Hitchcock, Friedkin, Polanski, Kubrick and Scott are among the all-time masters of horror and suspense with films topping AFI's Thriller list, the epitome of their genre. Their antithesis is embodied in a single director, Ed Wood, and his seminal film, Plan 9 from Outer Space. The real suspense in this movie is anticipating what will be bungled next: aimless plot meandering, continuity error, missed acting cue or mark, fumbled or nonsensical dialog delivery, cheesey prop malfunction, or a schlock-laden special effect. The thrill is never being disappointed. Not 30 seconds go by without a dramatic display of cinematic ineptitude, invariably some combination of them in epic proportion, continuing without respite from opening credits to a magnificently anti-climactic ending.

Plan 9 from Outer Space is so atrocious as to evoke sympathy for all involved, including the viewing audience. The ending brings great relief there is one, and it comes none too soon, with a fervent hope the future events depicted will affect the future . . . to prevent a sequel (Plan 10 anyone??).

What I would say is that you should see the movie Ed Wood (with Johnny Depp) before you watch this, it will give you a background in why this film is what it is, also check out the IMDB page on the movie and you will appreciate the *quality* of the movie even more.

So, we watched this at home with friends who are connoisseurs of bad movies and this one delivered to the max.  Remember that this film was made in black-and-white on a shoe-string budget (you can tell).  The acting is exuberant but I would not say that it was Oscar worthy (although maybe for comedic reasons).

The *special effects* are wonderful, they are so bad that you just laugh your way through them, continuity is a misnomer and the sets are amazing, meaning that it's amazing that they used them at all.

The use of Bela Lugosi was really an accident, Ed Wood was friends with him and he filmed him just before he died and then wrote the film around the scenes that he used.  The character of the old man was played by someone else (where he was terrorizing people), the person playing him there covered his face and was taller than Bela Lugosi (funny as hell).

This DVD also has a documentary (quite an old one) containing interviews with the cast members and shots of places that were in the movie, very interesting.

All in all this is great value for a night at the movies, as long as you embrace the general cheesyness of the plot, terrible acting, worse plot, continuity errors, bad special effects you'll have a great time.",1343433600,,1564,4.40625
594385,1,6303170498,"Though not ""The Worst Film of All Time,"" Edward D. Wood Jr.'s showcase of cinematic ineptitude remains in a class by itself. Perhaps ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" (1959) should have been titled ""The Show Must Go On,"" since nothing stood in the director's path:  Bela Lugosi's untimely death, lack of money and numerous technical difficulties. These ""obstacles"" are easily detected in the finished product, which makes it all the more hilarious. ""Plan 9"" resembles a three-ring circus of strange performers (TV psychic/narrator Criswell, 400-pound Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson and terror hostess Vampira), shoddy filmmaking techniques (scenes fluctuate from day to night) and bargain-basement production values (who can forget those hubcap flying saucers?). In some ways, Wood was a predecessor to the underground talents of Andy Warhol and John Waters  utilizing an eccentric stock company and writing outrageous scripts in a semi-documentary style.

594388,3,6303170498,"Since volumes have been written about this movie elsewhere, I will not rehash the plot or provide any sort of analysis of the movie here. This review is focused on the quality of the Legend Blu-ray release.

As a huge Plan 9 fan, and aficionado of badfilm and exploitation in general, I was both amused and pleasantly surprised to see this hit the Blu-ray format courtesy of Legend Films, and my curiosity was piqued enough to pick it up just to see what Plan 9 would look like in hi-def. However, upon viewing the B&W version on this disc, and making a side-by-side comparison with the 2000 Image/Wade Williams DVD, I was disappointed that Legend's edition is unfortunately a case of one step forward and two back.

First, the good news: the detail and sharpness are noticeably improved in the 1080p Blu-ray transfer, bringing out the textures of skin, hair, clothing, backgrounds, etc.; the framing of the movie reveals a little more information around the sides; and virtually all of the speckling present in the Image release has been cleaned up (or a much cleaner print was found).

Now for the bad news: the contrast is so flat as to make the movie nearly unwatchable without dramatically pumping up the contrast and then adjusting (lowering) the brightness of your TV/monitor. In my direct comparison of the two editions, the tonal values (much deeper blacks, brighter highlights, and richer grayscale) of the Image disc blew the Legend Blu-ray out of the water. Legend really dropped the ball in this department. I had to switch the A/V settings of my 60"" Sharp LCD to my custom ""low-fi"" mode, which I created specifically to pump up the contrast of flat-looking discs such as this one, in order to approximate the superior picture of the Image disc. (Media Blasters' Destroy All Monsters Blu-ray exhibits the same problem; see my review under that title.) Another small disappointment (a very minor point, I know) is that the Legend release is missing the Distributors Corporation of America screen credit that opens the Williams/Image DVD before cutting to Criswell's intro.

So, the bottom line is that there is still room for a truly definitive, Blu-ray-worthy transfer of this movie. Sadly, this isn't it. I will probably keep the disc, mainly for the (color) home movies (2:06) of Ed and Kathy celebrating his birthday and Ed in drag next to their Christmas tree, and the generic B&W TV commercials (3:45) for used cars, boots, jewelry, and men's clothes, the latter starring the director himself. I'm not that big on the Rifftrax/MST3K concept, colorization, or trivia tracks, but they might be worth a watch/listen, and a few laughs, for those who are. I did skip through the colorized version out of curiosity, and it actually doesn't look too bad (kind of like an old tinted postcard), especially compared to those 1980s colorized abominations. But since Legend bastardized the colorized version by actually digitally altering a few shots within the film, I can't imagine why I'd ever watch it in its entirety.

Let's hope Williams and Image pick up the gauntlet and put out a superior Blu-ray edition some day (yeah, right). This one just made me think about what might have been. What a disappointment!",1333929600,9,3222,4.904587155963303

And few people are as perfectly suited to do that than the guys who brought us Mystery Science Theater 3000. Well, there aren't any robots in this, but we do get three guys making relentless fun of the movie. ""RiffTrax: Plan 9 From Outer Space"" does what most people do when confronted by a terrible film:

The plot is actually a bit baffling at first. Flying saucers are buzzing a random American town, but the military is pretending that they don't exist because... actually, I'm not sure why they're being this stupid. After all, it's not as if the military denials keep PEOPLE from seeing it.

So the aliens (Dudley Manlove, John Breckenridge) implement Plan 9: raising the dead (Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson, Vampira) as zombies, and sending them out to attack people.... very slowly. Only an intrepid (read: bumbling) trio of humans will be able to infiltrate the flying saucer, and discover why the aliens have come to Earth.

""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is one of those movies like ""Birdemic,"" ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" and ""Troll 2"" -- it is so bad that somehow it ends up being entertaining. The MST3K guys did a lot of movies like that (including other Ed Wood movies), so it feels incredibly natural that they would unleash their snark on this one.

Basically it's just three guys sitting there, making fun of an old movie -- the cast (""You know, you name your son 'Dudley Manlove' and you pretty much guarantee he'll have a huge presence as the Folsom Street Fair""), the flimsy sets (""We'll be okay if the plywood controls hold out!""), and the ghastly script (they mostly just giggle through Ed Wood's pseudoscience).

Anyone who enjoyed the legendary ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" will adore ""RiffTrax: Plan 9 From Outer Space"" -- it's a movie so bad it's funny, mocked by guys who are simply funny.",1332115200,,2084,4.695890410958904
594391,1,6303170498,"I am a huge Ed Wood fan and this is one of my favorite films simply because it has such an awful beauty. BUT I am not a fan of colorization so what I say here only has to do with the black and white version on this blu-ray. First of all, the dark blacks in the film have all been washed out so they appear as dark grey. The whiter portions of the picture, especially the actors faces and other areas that show skin produce a fuzzy halo effect, almost like a filter was over the camera. Or maybe all the actors/actresses in the movie are actually angels. Some other weird effects, caused by who knows what, is the perception of an almost rain-like effect as though lines of grain are falling from the sky across the film....even weirder is the presence of 2 transparent horizontal lines on the left and right sides which look like the Klingon cloaking device effect which causes distortions on the picture. Like when a car drives across the screen when it passes through the lines, it's almost like you're seeing it through a window pane with rain drops running down it. I am not a video expert, so if you are one, please can you come up with the tech terms for the effects I have described?

ONE improvement is that all the picture snap, crackle, and pops from my DVD version seem to have been corrected. The DVD version I have is the Image Wade Williams Collection edition. There's no reason to get this blu-ray since that one is still the superior version of this film. The weird lighting and distorted lines in this version make it unwatchable in my book.

It's one of those bad movies that is so beautifully consistent, so weird, so utterly bafflingly WRONG that it ends up being the PERFECT bad movie. Few movies are as perfectly suited to snark. And the wretchedness is spread smoothly like luxurious upholstery over the ghastly dialogue, bad acting and laughable storyline, until EVERYTHING becomes hilarious.

The plot is actually a bit baffling at first. Flying saucers are buzzing a random American town, but the military is pretending that they don't exist because... actually, I'm not sure why they're being this stupid. After all, it's not as if the military denials keep PEOPLE from seeing those flying saucers. So the aliens (Dudley Manlove, John Breckenridge) implement Plan 9.

What is Plan 9? It's raising the dead (Bela Lugosi, Tor Johnson, Vampira) as zombies, and sending them out to attack people.... very slowly.

Sadly, this does not have the desired effect, since it only happens to three corpses, and nobody really knows how to respond to the dead lurching slowly to attack the living. Only an intrepid (read: bumbling) trio of humans will be able to infiltrate the flying saucer, and discover why the aliens have come to Earth. It's quite a letdown.

""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is one of those movies like ""Birdemic,"" ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,"" ""The Room"" and ""Troll 2."" It is so bad that somehow it goes all the way around, and ends up being entertaining. Every single thing about this movie is awkward, strange, inept or just plain WRONG -- there is not a single redeeming characteristic about this movie.

And it's WONDERFUL.

No comedy could be as amusingly awful as this movie. The dialogue is clunky and sometimes semi-incoherent (""A flying saucer? You mean the kind from up there?"" ""Yeah, either that or its counterpart""), the science sounds like it was lifted from a Monty Python skit, and the plot lumbers along in a confused, stumbling manner... not unlike Tor Johnson. Sometimes it feels like two unrelated movies (a vampire movie and a sci-fi movie) somehow got mixed up.

This was also sadly the last movie that featured the late great Bela Lugosi, and he's quite good for the two-and-a-half minutes of actual footage that he's in. Actually, most of the supporting cast is too good for this movie, giving the awkward feeling that they're not sure what they're doing. They're not GOOD (in fact, most are pretty bad) but they're better than the movie deserves.

Dudley Manlove is the one major exception, giving a hilariously over-the-top performance (""Stupid! Stupid minds!"") as an alien who tries to entreat humanity by repeatedly insulting us. Tor Johnson is hilarious as an undead hulk who has a perpetual look of mild horror on his face, and Vampira is awesome just because she's in this.

Oh, and definitely get the edition of the movie with Mike Nelson's commentary track. No, on second thought, get the Rifftrax edition.

The movie is as awesome as ever and while it doesn't look overly impressive, it's probably the best it can look.  For anyone wondering, the colorized version is the 2006 version with the alterations.  The company, Legend, had two auctions on eBay for the chance to put new material in the film.  This happens at 15:50 with two new names on the tombstone and from 30:47-31:01 with the middle picture over Paula Trent's bed changed.  Also, when Jeff hits Eros at 67:11, Eros' face turns green.  Have no fear, the original black & white version is still included.

The greatest exchange in the history of cinema:

Colonel Tom Edwards: Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our earth?

594475,5,6303170498,"Man, a few of the other reviewers clearly don't get this movie at all.

""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is one of my absolute favorite movies, though some don't understand why it would be.  Its famous for winning the title of ""worst movie of all time"" in the Golden Turkey books, but its far from being that bad.  As a fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, I can tell you there are many films much MUCH harder to sit through than Plan 9.

The main reason Plan 9 is so noteable is because its a movie that tried so hard to be something so big, but failed at every part of it.  Many place the blame on director Ed Wood for being inept.  While I'm not gonna say he was the worlds greatest director, I do feel the outcome was due more to the circumstances Ed Wood was working under than anything else.  I don't care if you're Stanley Kubrick, if you don't have consultants, editors, studio time, actors, or any kind of special effects budget, you're not going to pull off a movie about space aliens creating an army of the undead.  Its like asking Michelangelo to sculpt David but only giving him a can of Play-Doh to do it.

I think it speaks to at least some amount of talent on Woods part to actually get a movie completed at all given the uphill battle he often worked against to get his movies done.

That said, the reason we all watch Plan 9 is that its hilarious.  Its one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  None of that is on purpose, really, but the amount of weird dialogue, bad special effects, continuity errors, cheap sets, etc. piles up so deeply that you'd swear it was some kind of meta comedy poking fun at 50's sci-fi.  But its not.  Ed Wood really tried, and that comes through loud and clear, even if it means flying saucers on visible wires, cardboard tombstones that fall over when people pass them, stock footage of world war two, a pilot's cockpit separated by a shower curtain, or tons of scenes were day and night switch back and forth between shots.

So we laugh, deeply and often, but in the end its not a movie we deride, its a movie we genuinely love, with as many memorable characters, scenes and quoteable lines as any film that's actually considered good.

If you have a sense of humor and an appreciation of irony, you gotta see Plan 9, its the best ""bad movie"" you'll ever see.",1329955200,3,2306,4.315545243619489
594476,4,6303170498,"PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is so bad that it is total fun to watch. Knowing some background of the productions makes it all more enjoyable. After seeing a big screen special showing recently, I had to add this film to my collection. PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is pure Ed Wood. No one else could make a movie like this nor would anyone want to.

The delightful Gregory Walcott spoke at the screening I attended and gave fascinating insight into the film. He explained that Ed Wood was so charming and so outgoing that he could convince people to invest in his film. The production values are low. A shower curtain and cardboard stood in for the cabin door of a aircraft cockpit.

It sure takes a lot of dedication to make a movie starring a famous actor who dies BEFORE filming begins. Try to work that one out. Horror film king Bela Lugosi died before filming began so Wood simply used some test filming he had done of Lugosi walking out of his house and down the street. Wood then used his wife's chiropractor to fill in the story as Lugosi. Nevermind that he was too young and way too tall as a stand-in for Lugosi. Plus using his cape to cover his face would surely fool the audience.

The camp factor is high in this film as Vampira and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson complete the cast. The fun factor is high as you realize the legitimate actors such as Gregory Walcott and Mona McKinnon play it straight as the married couple Jeff and Paula Trent. They aren't bad at all. How did they end up in this Ed Wood film?

Here's one thing to consider. PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE might be one of the worst films ever made but it is also one of the most enduring.

I've seen many cornball 1950s sci-fi films, some excellent and some pretty hokey.  Plan 9 is an insult to hokey.

The film starts out with a white-haired man, who also subs as our narrator.  He's given the sign and name ""Criswell Predicts"" or some such, rambling about the future and how that's where we will spend the rest of our lives (oh really?).  He ends his speech with saying the innocent will be rewarded and the guilty punished.  And then he babbles about graverobbers from space!

Holy alarmist!

The story starts out with people at a gravesite burying an old man's wife.  The old man is Bela Lugosi in his last appearance on film.  He's the only one actually acting with proper grief while others stare into space or pretend to read a bible.

Later, we are spotting flying saucers that somehow buzz people with a swoosh sound but no wind.  A woman rises and wiggles her fingers at two gravediggers.  It's reported they were ""tore up like by a bobcat"" but she didn't do anything!

The editing is horrible.  Day, night, light, dark.  Hard to tell what time it is.

Inspector Clay, played by Grade Z actor Tor Johnson, has the strangest accent for an LA policeman.  He dies early in the film.  His sergeant takes over the investigation and says, ""He's dead, murdered and someone is responsible!""  Wow!

We jump into the saucers, lots of them, as they wiggle and look like used kitchen appliances on wires.  Newspaper headlines, saucers over Hollywood!  Saucers over D.C.!  And we see all the major TV networks being buzzed:  ABC, CBS and NBC and even a theater with Eartha Kitt appearing!  What??

A general in charge of ""saucer field activities"" tries to shoot the saucers down to no avail.  What I don't get is why his superior officer tells him that the government denies they even exist and threatens him with a court martial, but they've already been seen by hundreds of people and appeared in the newspapers.  How can it be denied?  Makes no sense.

Aliens:  They look like regular people who have a strange salute by slapping their shoulders cross-armed.  Had to do something I guess.  The saucers fly to and fro from a big ""Space Station 7"" where the aliens plan on Plan 9, the restimulation of the recently dead with their ""electro guns.""  Why they want to do this was vague throughout most of the film.

And the story goes....

I was impressed with Lugosi, how he whipped his cape around, making tough gestures with his ands and arms.  It's unfortunate he had to pass on in an Ed Woods film!

It's a cornucopia of fun and a triumphant tribute to Lugosi (and his colleagues, those great Universal Pictures stars), a celebration of their ""Shock Theatre"" 1950's revival, and, for good measure, even starring a grand movie host of the time, Vampira. Where the early '50's classic ""Invaders From Mars"" excels because it draws us kids into the story line 'cause it's very much from the child star's vantage point, ""Plan 9"" goes one better! Ed Wood pieced it together and filmed it as WE might have directed the film as kids! ""Cool, you mean you actually got Bela Lugosi footage?!"" ""I know, let's have Tor Johnson walk through the graveyard here! That would be neat!"" ""Hey, I saw ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" last Saturday night. That host, Vampira, would be great for our movie...she's spooky!"",....,etc..  I think Ed Wood had an absolute ball filming ""Plan 9"". There is genuine love in every frame. And I have never doubted his true love, respect, and admiration for Bela Lugosi. He was a huge fan of the man in the cape...just like the rest of us.

Or enjoy the head alien berating the film's hero by explaining his dastardly plan and then yelling ""Stupid!"" ""Stupid!"". 'Plan 9', as our narrator Criswell explains, is a plan conceived by aliens to resurrect the dead in order to convince humans of their existence and power. They fly their saucers over Hollywood Boulevard, before devising a plan to parade the newly dead on the steps of the state capital. Three people are successfully resurrected: a sexy/creepy woman (Vampira) wearing a flowing black gown complete with plunging neckline, the lead cop on the case (Tor Johnson) who was struck down by spaceships and my personal favorite The Dead Old Man (Lugosi). Turns out Vampira and the Old Man were married and now thanks to the aliens they have been reunited. The three walking dead roam Hollywood and attempt to scare anyone who crosses their path and then bring them back to the spaceship. There's no point elaborating more on the plot because it doesn't matter. The Passport DVD has it's good and bad points. The bonuses include a trailer gallery for other Ed Wood films and a bonus documentary consisting of interviews with actors who have played Wood or Lugosi (Johnny Depp and Martin Landau) and family members of Wood and his stock company of actors (Wood's ex-wife, Vampira and Bela Lugosi's son). The downside is that the picture and audio are atrocious. Plus, Passport's annoying logo, PIP, is in the right hand corner the whole time. It's pretty distracting. Once you get past that, watch the trailer gallery and you'll agree with Depp that Wood paved the way for other cult directors like Tim Burton, John Waters and David Lynch.

Of course it's terrible.  If approached anything like cinematic quality it would have been bad.  As it is, however, it's terrific, especially if you've knocked down three or four beers in advance.  The sets are cheesy, the special effects a joke, the acting ridiculous and the jokes over the top.  Aliens, the chief of whom is a total swish, are angry at earth people for not recognizing that they are real.  They also believe that earthlings--despite the fact that we are incredibly stupid, juvenile idiots--are about to develop technologies that will destroy the Universe.  Therefore, in an equal measure of pique and fear, they must destroy the human race.  Not that they haven't tried it before..eight times before, to be exact...and have failed every time.  Now they spring their ultimate plan--Plan 9--which is doomed to failure, also.

So how is it that earthlings might destroy the Universe.  Read this carefully Al Gore.  We are on the verge of discovering Solarbenite, which will ignite the sun's rays, set up a chain reaction, blow up the sun and then every planet in the Universe.  Too complicated for you?  Well, the aliens explain it in terms that the idiot earthlings can uncerstand.  ""Imagine a gas can and a ball.  Pour the gas from the can in a line to the ball.  Put a match to the ball.  The ball is the earth and ignites burning back to the can, which is the sun.  The sun explodes, blowing up all the planets and then, in a catastrophic chain reaction, every planet in the Universe.""  What a terrific alternative energy source.  Why did it take Ed Woods to figure it out?

Anyway, the flying saucer extraterrestrials set out to destroy the human race by reanimating dead bodies buried in one particular graveyard.  Vampira and Bela Lugosi, both recently deceased, are resurrected along with the murdered Chief of Police.  These zombies then stumble around in the dark clumsily trying to murder people.  Well, it all might have worked out just fine had not several of our earthling heroes not stumbled into a flying saucer than looks a lot like somebody's house.  There's a fight, the saucer catches fire and, after our heroes make a quick departure, blows up while escaping into outer space.  Therefore, and fortunately for the earth, Plan 9 is foiled.  No doubt, however, there will be Plans 10 and 11 but unfortunately without Bela Lugosi.  He died while filming this masterpiece, necessitating his replacement with a 'stunt' double.

This classic creation from the brilliant mind of Ed Wood is about as good as it gets. A masterpiece in every sense of the word, Plan 9 from outer space is a piece of art.

A terrifying threat from outer space comes with the power to make the dead come alive. One by one, the undead are being brought back to terrorise the living. The police are sent to investigate the strange happenings in the cemetary. Will they be able to stop the body snatchers from outer space!!

Tor Johnson gives the performance of his lifetime as the inspector Dan Clay, he's totally believable and mind numbingly horrific as he is brought back from the dead. Vampira also shines in her role as - vampire girl! You may have nightmares and not be able to shake off the memories of her terrifying visage as she walks and stalks her prey.

This is also the last chance to view the mighty Bela Lugosi as he gives his final performance here. It's only a brief part as he is seen grieving his dead wife at the beginning, as he sadly died before filming finished his part was then played by a chiropractor friend of a friend of Ed Wood. Look out also for a powerful cameo by the director playing the guy holding a newspaper.

Be warned, this film is not for the faint of heart, horror fans only please for this lesson in terror is almost too much to bear!!

Ok, seriously folks, this is the best of the best of ""B"" grade sclock that has been produced. There are more laughs to be had here than the average Hollywood ""comedy"" and it's a true joy to behold the master in his top form here. Witness night turn to day then back to night in the graveyard. Marvel at Tor Johnson's mumbling as ""Lobo"" gets to finally speak. Watch as cardboard gravestones are knocked over by the bumbling cast. Hear the hysterics of the alien leader and above all be entertained by this wonderful movie by the king of the B grades himself - Edward D. Wood Jnr.

Enjoy and thanks for reading.",1192665600,,2193,4.481203007518797
594848,3,6303170498,"Where do I begin?  In this case the plot is not important whatsoever.  This Ed Wood classic cult film was billed as the worst film ever!  I will have to agree with that statement.  This was made to be a serious sci-fi/horror film, but because of its really bad special effects, it turns into a comedy!  Bela Lugosi was in this, but died during filming.  Ed Wood just inserted another ""actor"" and made him cover his face so the audience couldn't tell the difference, well we weren't fooled!  The movie opens up at a graveside service for a beloved.  It goes from day to night to day and back to night in the same scene---putting a new meaning to the term ""day for night"".  The grave stones were made from either cardboard or styrofoam--take your pick.  Since the film was made in 1959, my guess would be cardboard.  The crypt in the cemetery was about 3 feet wide and maybe 4 feet high, but a rather large group of people came out of it---it was hysterical!  My question was where did they come from and how did they fit?  I'm not quite done yet with describing the special effects.  There was one scene onboard a plane.  The pilot and co-pilot were sitting in the cockpit.  There was no steering wheel, the controls amounted to a ""board"" apiece and they were sitting on what appeared to be kitchen chairs.  The co-pilot pulled a ""shower curtain"" to close off the cockpit before take-off.  In the background you saw a clipboard (never moved during flight) and a ""paper plate"" with an arrow (I guess it was supposed to be some sort of instrument).  Oh, the aliens' flying saucers were not paper plates as you may have thought, they were hubcaps, but don't ask me for the make or models of the cars they came from.  I went to college for filmmaking, but even our low budget projects had better special effects!  This film made me laugh at every scene!  You ask what is the plot?  Briefly aliens come down and take corpses out of their graves and program them to kill people, at least that is what I think it is!  I would highly recommend everyone own a copy of this!  You, by the end of the film, would learn how to make a better one and laugh your a#@ off!  The DVD reproduction was excellent quality---well from the a film techical point!

594849,5,6303170498,"Ed Wood went down in history for being one of the ""worst filmmakers of all time.""  No doubt, PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE was what pushed him toward obtaining that title.  It is indeed filled with cardboard sets and equally cardboard acting.  It features Bela Lugosi in his last starring role, before his death.  The only problem remained that Mr. Lugosi died during filmmaking.  What to do, what to do......Well, while some filmmakers would have re-shot the scenes of Lugosi in the graveyard, Wood kept the cuts that remained from the scenes (or should I say SCENE) that Lugosi appeared in and shows them on a loop, during the course of this caper (where alien invasion and the foolishness of humankind is a constant factor), as well as casting an actor baring little or no resemblance to Lugosi with a cape over his face, so as to conceal his true identity as the stand in.  What's more, we see Vampira, an actress with a waistline that defies reality (just watch the film....you won't believe it unless you see it for yourself!) cast as--what else--a vampire.

594941,5,6303170498,"Yes, my dreams of a wonderful world filled with colorized movies are slowly coming true.  Let me be clear, I would much rather see any drab, dull, dated looking b/w feature, be it movie or TV show, in the beautiful wonderfully modern style colorized versions that we can so fortunately see today.  I absolutely love Bewitched and I Dream of Jeanie Seasons 1 in the new colorized versions.  I wish the same could now be done for all I Love Lucy & The Honeymooners.

As for Plan 9 In Outer Space, I was the first to buy this just because it was colorized and I was therefore the first to be impressed with the wonderful colorization process that is in it's full glory here.  Bela Lugosi has never looked so good in beautiful LIVING (but not for long, unfortunately for him) COLOR!  I love any b/w movie or TV show in this new wonderful color process.  Let's hope the coloring of the drab b/w movie and TV shows continues.

I won't rest till Citizen Kane and Seventh Seal and any other hoidy toidy purist's favorite is beautifully colorized!!  Any b/w show or movie can be vastly improved with the new wonderful colorization process.  It ain't your Daddy's colorized movies any more.  The technology today is perfected and beautifully natural and real looking.  If you want to see another great colorized example from the Legend people who colored Plan 9, then buy the Sherlock Holmes movies that they colorized.  Beautiful, just beautiful.  Color my world and my movies and TV shows too.

Oh, and for you sickening pretenders who claim to prefer the ""pure b/w"" I proclaim this order too, after colorizing all b/w TV shows and movies the b/w negatives should be destroyed so you b/w pretenders can have something else to howl about.  Of course b/w negatives are NOT destroyed, but this hasn't stopped the lying purists to cry that the sky is falling everytime another movie is beautifully colorized.

If b/w is so wonderful, how come every single movie that is in b/w that comes out on DVD has a color picture cover?  If b/w is so beautiful why don't they put the dull drab b/w cover pictures on the DVD releases??  It's because people naturally prefer color, it's natural, it's real, it's the preferred way anyone would want to see an image.  But a dull b/w cover on a disc is ugly, b/w is automatically dated looking, COLOR sells because COLOR is more attractive.  That's why COLORIZATION should not only be applied to the covers of b/w DVDs but to the films themselves of all b/w films and TV shows.

First, they fly around in their flying saucers that are ""shaped like huge cigars"" (??) and fiendishly shine lights in people's faces. Second, they raise three random people from the dead, taking care not to let anyone know they are responsible for this (It could blow their cover.) The dead people, acting on the orders of the aliens, wander aimlessly around a graveyard. One of them even goes into a nearby house and horrifies a woman by walking slowly and staring at her. Finally, the aliens cleverly reveal their entire plan to a trio of snoopers who manage to find their ship (It was hidden behind a tree.) They explain to the Earthlings that they fear Earth will one day discover how to make a Solaranite bomb that will explode the sun. Then they explain to the Earthlings exactly how the Solaranite bomb works. This is why they have to destroy us before we destroy them which will ultimately prove to us that they exist... or something. But there's one thing that these highly advanced aliens didn't count on: three of the Earthlings might resist somewhat.

""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is Ed Wood's masterpiece and is considered by most to be the worst film ever made. Even Criswell couldn't have predicted the cult popularity it has gained. Bela Lugosi died shortly after filming began so the majority of his scenes are played by a look-alike who looks nothing like him. The dialogue is awkward and nonsensical, the set looks like it was borrowed from an elementary school play, and the acting makes Keanu Reeves look like Sir Lawrence Olivier. Listing all the continuity errors would take longer than the film's running time. The only thing that could have made the film worse would have been to include Dolores Fuller.

594944,5,6303170498,"Ed Wood's masterpiece, made with a low budget and filmed under trying conditions, is the greatest movie in the history of mankind.  Bela Lugosi (whose reanimated corpse grew a foot taller), Vampira and Tor Johnson comprised the zombie army that was going to march on the capitals of the world.  The alien Leader (John ""Bunny"" Breckinridge) had Bela's reanimated corpse destroyed, in order to strike fear in the humans, as opposed to some world leaders, who would have called for more troops.  In the world of Plan 9, such outdated concepts as day and night, the living and the dead, and original footage and stock footage, have no meaning.  But I have yet to reveal the true greatness of this movie.

The alien Eros (Dudley Manlove) explains that his mission on Earth is to destroy us before we develop the Solaranite bomb.  His metaphorical explanation of the Solaranite bomb is chilling.  ""Take a can of your gasoline.  Say this can of gasoline is the sun.  Now, you spread a thin line of it to a ball, representing the earth.  Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the sun particles.  Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight.  Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame will speedily travel around the earth, back along the line of gasoline to the can, or the sun itself.  It will explode this source and spread to every place that gasoline, our sunlight, touches.  Explode the sunlight here, gentlemen, you explode the universe!""

595020,3,6303170498,"I picked up ""Plan 9"" purely for its reputed schlock value. Any movie described on its own cover as one of the 50 worst films of all time has to be worth a look!

And bad it is.

The overwrought narration, the characters who appear without introduction, the ridiculous props (hubcap spaceships?), the padding by using extra ""takes"" of the same scene, the ludicrous use (after Bela Lugosi's death) of an actor pretending to be Lugosi by covering his face with a cape...the absurdities go on and on. The plot, such as it is, revolves around a bunch of insecure extraterrestrials (who look terrifyingly like middle-aged white men) who are sick of being ignored be Earthlings. By resurrecting the dead, they plan to get the attention they deserve. Hence, much of the action switches between the interior of the spacecraft and a spooky graveyard.

Even by the standard of Saturday matinee horror flicks, this film is ridiculously poor. It would be completely inexplicable without my having seen ""Ed Wood"" years ago. Watching Wood scavenge Hollywood trash bins for the discarded military war footage he used in the film gave the work a bit of the pathos that would have been missing otherwise. I'd like to say that ""Plan 9"" was one of those films that is so bad that it's good, but it's not. It's just horrilbly bad, with hardly a redeeming feature.

The casting is horrendous with wooden acting combined with over emoting.  The actors can not be blamed totally, for the writing sucks.  The production values are terrible.  This has the look of an amateur production, done by high school kids.  So you would think this is one to skip, but you have got to watch this.  It is sheer fun.

But calling this movie The Worst Movie Of All Time is unfair.  After all, Glen or Glenda is worse than Plan 9.  This is Ed Wood at his best worst or worst best.  Plan 9 is Ed's masterpiece!",1154995200,3,313,3.9047619047619047
595121,5,6303170498,"First off, ""Plan 9"" is not the worst movie ever made. That is clear to anyone who has ever watched MST3K. Movies like ""Red Zone Cuba"" or ""Manos, hands of Fate"" are clearly much worse than ""Plan 9."" Instead, ""Plan 9"" is the best bad movie ever made. When you look at the elements separately - the stilted dialog, the narration, the poor acting, wondrously bad special effects, and the dopey story - it is clearly a bad movie. What saves it from permanent obscurity is Ed Wood's unique take on reality. You have to see it to believe it.

The packaging of this classic movie is pretty good. You get both the digitally remastered Black and White version for you purists out there, and the newer ""colorized"" version. Colorized movies never look quite right to me, and this one is no exception. The most glaring problem is the skin tones. Some people look pretty natural, but others look really bizarre. But if you can overlook some of those problems, the colors are pretty good and do add something to the experience.

In my mind, the best part of this package is Mike Nelson's commentary. This is Mike Nelson from Mystery Science Theater 3000 fame and he does his MST3K shtick throughout. While Mike's commentary is very amusing, you can see why they never did this movie on MST3K. There is just too much dialog. It seems like Mike is interrupting the dialog and I think that would have hurt an MST screening. But in this context it is perfect.

A word on the extras. I was disappointed with the ""Trailers"" advertised. I was expecting Ed Wood trailers. But instead these are trailers from other movies that have been colorized.

Otherwise, this is a great DVD. I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes ""bad"" movies. This may be the best version of ""Plan 9"" yet. Eddie would be proud...",1154304000,7,1784,4.565625

The B&W version of Plan 9 may be one of the greatest movies ever made but the colorized version is it! The detail is incredible. Not only do you see the shower curtain in  it's full glory but the strings on the flying saucers are even more visible.

You can admire your modern slam bang movies all you want but none of them hold a candle to this masterpiece of acting, direction by Mr. Wood and the non-stop action which leaves you on the edge of your seat.

I just wish that some of the modern directors would study Ed Wood's techniques and bring us movies that even come close to this true masterpiece of film making.

I would give it more than 5 stars but that is the Amazon maximum.",1154044800,,769,4.175675675675675

595125,4,6303170498,"Originally shot and completed in 1956,but wasn't released until 1959,legendary schlock master Ed Wood had originally made a low-budget sci-fi exploitation flick which later became fondly known by pure cinema snobs as one of the worst films of all time. Worst film my a--,""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is 'the' Wood cult classic and it's most certainly not one of the worst films ever made. In fact,it's also one of the most entertaining and fun films of the late '50's !  Following his highly controversial flicks ""Glen Or Glenda ?"" and ""Bride Of The Monster"" (both seriously regarded in my opinion as the two worst films of his career),Ed Wood wanted to make a cheesy low-budget sci-fi film that meant to be an exploitation ploy on America's fascination with the then popular UFO phenomenon and also in the midst of the Cold War. Most notable for the final film appearance of the legendary Bela Lugosi who sadly,before filming was supposed to begin,died of a heart attack. The actual footage of him in ""Plan 9"" was actually taken from test 'home movie' footage for a film that was thankfully never made called ""The Ghoul On The Moon"".Most of the later footage that involved Lugosi's character is actually played by none other than Ed Wood's real life chiropractor,Thomas Mason,who only is shown with a cape hiding over his face and is noticably a bit taller than Lugosi. Despite the claustrophobic appearances of the two men within the same scene,the film also has good,but not Hollywood good performances from Gregory Walcott as the story's main hero,Tom Keene,Paul Marco as Officer Kelton,Lyle Talbot,and of course the films' other famous stars Tor Johnson and Vampira. Sure it isn't meant to be a normal,average,everyday sci-fi B-movie,but when people look back on the film,Ed Wood knew that he was no Orson Welles nor Frank Capra and he probably thought he didn't intend ""Plan 9"" to be a serious sci-fi feature either. There's plenty of action,comedy,cheesy special effects,good photography,and of course the tedious,but plausible direction by Wood. I've seen many far worse very bad movies in terms of acting and production values,but ""Plan 9"" will certainly not dissappoint even the most casual of non-B-movie fan alike and this brand-new DVD release from the great folks at Legend Films certainly do justice to this legendary cult classic !

There have been only two other DVD releases of ""Plan 9"" prior to the Legend release,first by Image and then by budget distributor Passport Video. The big differences between the two versions were not only the visual presentation of the film themselves,but also two different documentaries about Wood and his films. The Image release featured a two-hour complete documentary on the making of the film called ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood:The Plan 9 Companion"" while Passport featured a much shorter 45 minute bio called ""The Ed Wood Story"".The brand-new Legend Films release is by far the definitive restoration work on the film to date and  it defintely shows too!  The disc features both a nicely restored original black & white version as well as showcasing for the first time,a brand-new digital colorized version of the film !  Considering a lot of the excellent colorization that Legend does with all of their films on DVD,the results for both are faboulous,but wait !  This version also has a collection of rare Ed Wood material that you probably won't find anywhere else on DVD with over three minutes of extremely rare TV commercials shot by the man himself (of lackluster quality) as well two-minute home movie footage of Ed celebrating his birthday and of course the famous footage of the director in drag and practically puts on a show for the camera ! The music track included in the home movie features are annoying and best left mute.  Fake 'deleted' scenes and colorized trailers for other great Legend releases also appear and to round off the disc,Mike ""MST3K"" Nelson is back as always for an another exciting,witty,and fun commentary track for both versions of the film as well !  Also too on either version of the film,a well-done trivia subtitle track also appears giving rare info on the making of the film,its stars and director. Makes a great companion and double feature piece to Tim Burton's well-done 1994 film ""Ed Wood"" with Johnny Deep in the title role as well !

Great special edition of a legendary 'turkey';highly recommended to classic film fans and buffs alike !  You are not going to be dissappointed with this definitive release ! Enjoy !",1153699200,7,4521,4.968253968253968
595126,4,6303170498,"Got me pegged there, Criswell, at least on the unxplainable bit. Why do hot dog buns come in packages of 8, and hot dogs ten? Why do ninety-five percent of incumbent politicians get re-elected when nearly every person you talk to gripes about the government? And just how did Ed Wood manage to convince a Baptist church to put up the cash to make this film after they read the script? Perhaps the greatest mystery about ""Plan 9"" is why so many people would consider it the worst film ever made. ""Plan 9"" may have a silly plot and bargain basement effects (those saucers are model kits, not hubcaps or plates), yet end to end, it never fails to entertain. Why, the worst crime in all of the arts is not being hokey or low budget, it's being *boring*. Most of the Ed regulars are here (Tor Johnson, Duke Moore, Paul Marco) or sort of here (Bela Lugosi in spliced in test footage shot months before filming). And Criswell's blustering narration suits the picture perfectly. This is the best print I've seen yet, and the sound is excellent. I skipped the colorized version, and the extras are basically worthless except for Mike Nelson's mildly amusing commentary track.

595127,4,6303170498,"Chances are, if you're reading this review or have seen the movie, you know all about Ed Wood (who was the subject of a Tim Burton-Johnny Depp film). Anyway, this film is considered Ed's masterpiece. But it's also considered the worst film ever made by a lot of people. Back then, it's easy to see why people would think of it that way. In modern times though, it's just a campy and inspired movie that just has way too many flaws. The movie has falling down cardboard sets, some of the worst acting you'll see,

horrible dialogue, and a person posing as Bela Lugosi walking around. In case you didn't know this, Bela Lugosi was the guy who played Dracula in that classic Universal horror film. His career faded after that, but he became a friend of Ed Wood's. Right before Wood started shooting this film, Lugosi died...But Ed, being the zany person he was, decided to put some old silent footage he had shot into this film and then use a person to cover his face as play the Lugosi character. The funny thing is, it is so obviously not Lugosi. This movie is funny; That wasn't the intent of the film. The movie was supposed to be a thrilling anti-war message, but that's not what impression it gave. Even though it has all these flaws, that actually makes it funny in the end. The movie has a stupid synopsis to boot. The movie is about cheap looking aliens who descend on a town to execute Plan 9, which will raise the dead for some purpose or other. They raise the ghost of a woman (Vampira)

and an old man (the guy who's supposed to be Bela Lugosi) who begin to wreak havoc on the town. The government insist that the flying saucers don't exist, but that doesn't stop people from seeing them...And the film eventually leads up to the people meeting the aliens...The aliens, I might add, look like people in costume. Anyway, this film is a cult classic and a lot of people who watch it will feel the same way people felt about it years ago. But people who have respect for filmmaking and realize how funny the badness of this movie is, will like it. When Ed Wood was alive he was critisized, when what he was trying to do was genuine. Now that he's dead, he's finally getting the recognition he deserves.

Like all American Masters (Russ Meyer, Korger Babb, William Castle, John Waters), Wood was first and foremost a SHOWMAN.

595289,4,6303170498,"Here it is, the worst movie ever made...or was it?  ""Plan 9"" has easily become the hip movie fans target of public enemy no. 1 for its crude production, acting and script, the ""The Rotten Review"" thinks that there's a case to be made that Ed Wood, the mastermind of this movie, may have been having a good laugh at all of us just the same.

THE PLOT: An old woman's death leaves her hubby (Bela Lugosi) heartbroken.  Soon, he is run down by a car - but both are mysteriously brought back as ghoulish zombies played by Vampira & Lugosi.  Investigating the cemetery where Lugosi and Vampira have begin claiming victims, Inspector Clay (Tor Johnson) himself is struck down.  Conveniently buried in the same cemetery, he too will rise to become one of the walking dead.  Meanwhile, a commercial pilot and an Army general, having seen UFO's, are told to keep quiet about it.  The general, however, is clued in by his supervisors, that they know all about the aliens - they've been sending us messages trying to wake us from our conceit of being alone in the universe.  ""How can anybody be so stupid?"" asks the alien Eros on the latest of the messages.  Unable to convince men through these messages, the aliens resort to turning our recent dead into an army of zombies.  Clay, the old man and his re-animated wife are only test subjects.  Against them are the general, the police and the commercial pilot, and the stupidity of mankind.

People love to diss this movie - though it's not an easy one to hate.  It didn't absorb huge sums of never-to-be-recouped money (""Waterworld"") nor try and distract us with star-power (""The Bodyguard"").  Also, the movie goes out of its way to exhibit its shlockiness - almost as if everything that made it famous was intentionally wrought upon it (Styrofoam headstones; the crude furnishings of that Pentagon office; the mock-up cockpit; the unforgettable dialog, the un-Lugosi-like double they used for Lugosi; and especially the voiceovers by seer Criswell, who never met a cue card he couldn't read and to whom we can thank for such inimitable lines as ""future events like these will affect you, in the future"").  Most reviewers eagerly accept that Director Ed Wood seriously meant every word.  When you look at it, though, much of it plays like a spoof of simply mediocre movies like ""Robot Monster"" or the lame attempts by Universal to milk the licenses out of Dracula, Frankenstein or the Wolfman.  Years before ""Saturday Night Live"" or the first episode of ""Second City TV"", Ed Wood brought us the very first effective spoof of grade-z drive-in movies.  Think about snarky delivery of the alien Eros, or the sedate response of ""The Ruler"" (John Breckenridge - Bill Murray played him in Burton's ""Ed Wood"".) or the overly spare interior of Eros's ship.  Although Wood is legendary as a horrible director, the cinematography is not distinctly bad (shaky camera, unnecessary zooms, poor placing of camera) and some traps seem to have been easier to avoid than they were to avoid.  (My prime example of the above: having Swedish actor Tor Johnson speak his own lines in a partially impenetrable accent - his face is away from the camera, so Wood could have easily dubbed them, or simply cast a similar, if slightly built actor to play his pre-death scenes, then switched Johnson in for his posthumous work.)  My guess is that Wood made ""Plan"" wore than it should have been to avoid comparisons to the superior ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" - it's obvious that even with standard production and scripts, the flick would've been mediocre at best.

That said, ""Plan"" is still irresistible - proof that even a horrible work hides great artistry.  There's some comic brilliance in his insertion of such great howlers as ""Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and somebody's responsible"" and ""Modern women. They've been like that all down through the ages"".  At the same time, the flick betrays signs of true horror aficionado - mostly in the casting of Tor Johnson.  As a huge and unstoppable zombie, he's perhaps the scariest of ghouls in any of Wood's movies.  In fact, he'd look more at home in the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" - gigantic and unyielding, the perfect paradigm of a life of gluttony unwilling to come to an end with death.

595290,5,6303170498,"This thing is every bit the turkey that legends claim it is. There's hardly a scene that doesn't have a gaffe or (at the very least) get bogged down in some way. Even when a moment looks promising something Ed finds ways for it to shoot itself in the foot. But, (incredibly!) there's something very good about it as well.

There are a variety of messages in Ed Wood's films and they're important ones that are both clear and concise in the way they're presented. He understood the human condition thoroughly. He realized that our potential is unlimited but that our own bigotry holds us back. He realized that rulers make decisions without consulting the masses and felt they used those prejudices to lead them like sheep. He saw that we're on the verge of going to the heavens and that we could go as benefactors or beasts. He clearly felt that (as things stand now) we'd be doing so as the latter. 'Plan Nine' appears to be a warning that we could end up as the scourge of the galaxy if we didn't look at ourselves closely before going further. Ed Wood had vision.

What he didn't have was an eye for detail. Either that or he didn't have the budget, time or patience to pay attention to it. Maybe his ego just wouldn't allow him to delegate some of the work involved in presenting his visions to anyone else. Who knows? Whatever the reason (or reasons) his films are a mess! And this one is no exception.

In one sequence the scene begins at night, shifts to daylight and returns to night again. The ghoul opens a locked door without forcing it and then turns away from his victim as if to make it easy for her to flee. Then the scene shifts from night back to day and back to night again while the (intended) victim runs aimlessly back and forth through the same group of tombstones. During the (thrilling) chase that ensues two different cast member's brush against the ""stones"" and cause them to flutter. The scene shifts to broad daylight again (I'm not making this up) as the rescuer arrives, changes to night as he finds the victim and to dusk when he rescues her. By now she's wearing sandals (even though she was barefoot when the ghoul invaded her home). The ghoul watches all this in broad daylight while the rescuer's car refuses to start at dusk. When the car finally starts the ghouls depart at various different times.

That's just seven minutes worth. The whole film is like this. The ""flying saucers"" are too small for the backdrops behind them. Police arrive in different cars than what they're shown approaching in. When they talk they point their guns at themselves and each other. A headstone falls into the grave as a corpse comes back to life but is back in place (and swaying) as he rises. It's also a different ""stone"" than what fell in the grave moments before. Scenes are out of sync with the narration. Bela Lugosi's stand-in is obviously thirty years younger than he was. The old man's wife dies and returns as ...Vampira!

Huh!

The acting (for lack of a better word) and dialogue is just as bad as the attention to detail is. Bela Lugosi gives the best performance in the film and he died before most of it was shot. Tor Johnson is unintelligible as a live human and unbelievable as a dead one; he's always blinking (and breathing) when he shouldn't be. Dudley Manlove overacts so badly he should have been giving ham lessons to William Shatner. Vampira's (Maila Nurmi) crowning moment comes when she stumbles into a prop. John (Bunny) Breckinridge swishes through every scene he's part of. Criswell is ...well, Criswell. The rest of the cast that nobody ever heard of is uniformly wooden. The dialogue ranges between lame (""Do you suppose the passengers saw it?""), inane (""It was quite a jolt Jeff. I'll check.""), insane (""We are all interested in the future for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives"") and completely ridiculous (""Colonel Tom Edwards in charge of Saucer Field Activities was to make the greatest decision of his career.""). There's almost never a moment that isn't like this. Each scene has one gaffe after another. Almost all of them are punctuated by bad dialogue, filled with bad acting, mismatched footage or all of the above. It really is incredible to watch.

But, it's not that bad really. Ed's passion, his love of his work and his dedication to his vision shine through even when he's at his most inept (which is all of the time). He was trying to make a statement and somehow he did.

The films of Ed Wood ...there's nothing quite like them. We start by laughing only to realize that he may have been great.

The restoration and transfer to DVD is very good. There are a few segments where the quality of the film is questionable but they're mostly in the stock footage that Ed used. Some of it probably wasn't in great shape in the first place. The interviews included on the DVD are interesting as well, particularly the ones with Dolores Fuller and Vampira. The theatrical trailers for Ed's most notorious ""masterpieces"" are included and they yield plenty of fun. All in all this is a very good package, one that should find a home with anyone who loves the films of Ed Wood.

As Dolores Fuller stated, ""it's to bad he couldn't have been alive to see it"".",1120608000,6,5245,4.552492046659597

You could almost swear that he was talking about the movie itself.  ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is one of those things that you simply have to see to believe.  From Criswell's platinum, cowlicked coif and hysterically overwrought narration to the surprise day/night transitions, tiny mausoleums and paper tombstones, this film is a monument to substance over style.

  Many people will tell you that this is the worst film ever made.  Please, dear reader, don't be deceived!  This description couldn't be farther from the truth.  The title of ""Worst Movie Ever Made"" would indicate that a film has no artistic merit or entertainment value at all, and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" has both in spades.  This is a B-movie, and one must suspend disbelief to enjoy it to its fullest.  More than anything, this film proves that special effects mean very little to a film when you have something this genuinely unique.

  As a matter of fact, ""Plan 9"" is the BEST at what it attempts to be, which is a memorable, fun, and tounge-in-cheek tribute to the B-films of the past.  Therefor, I like to call it the best bad movie ever made.  It's a title that's much more fitting, and one that Ed Wood himself would have appreciated!",1117584000,,1373,4.682008368200837

I say there are worse movies becasue there are some out there that are just too boring to watch. For me, that was the case with GLEN OR GLENDA. PLAN 9 does not commit that artistic sin. Instead, you are riveted to the screen to see what the next cinematic blunder will be and can even halfway follow the ludicrous story while you do it.

The story is of a race of aliens which perceive Earth to be a danger because of our proclivity of blowing things up. Atom bombs come most readily to mind. They conceive of a plan to reanimate the dead and use them to take over the world. Along the way, there is plenty of meaningless dialog, meaningless shots, meaningless props, meaningless constumes and meaningless special effects cobbled together on a meaningless budget. It is all very funny except when it is remembered that Ed Wood took this work seriously.

Bela Lugosi plays a bit part in this film. His footage was shot before his death and before there was a real story to work with. Apparently Ed wanted to use his name and wrote his script around the footage he had shot. He gets a chiropracter to play the rest of the Lugosi part by holding his cape over his face.

Others from Wood's stable of misfits put in an appearance as well. These include TOr Johnson, Vampira and the Amzzing Criswell.

In addition to the movie, this DVD conatins a documentary about the movie which is almost twice as long as the film itself. While not a great piece of documentary, it was interesting enough to watch for its own sake.

What more can I add to what's already been said?  But I do have a question that perhaps other reviewers can help me answer.  I also have an observation to make.

  In the ""big scene"" about halfway through where Eros brings Tor onboard the Mother Ship"" to show off to The Leader, he starts off by giving his report.  The Leader is upset and says ""You are many days late."", to which Eros replies, ""It was unavoidable.""  Immediately at that point, The Leader lets out a low burping-type sound that seems to be totally out of place with the dialogue.  I have replayed this many times over and I have absolutely no idea what he is trying to do.  Perhaps another reviewer can shed light on this.

  Finally, I also have an observation to offer.  Later in the same scene, The Leader asks Eros about the other dead ones that he has risen.  Eros replies, ""One is a woman, the other an old man.""  I can't help but chuckle when John Breckinridge, or as he was known to his friends ""Bunny"" Breckinridge says with a little gleam in his eye, ""An old man you say?""

It would not have cost too much more to shoot the graveyard scene in a real cemetery instead of a weed filled lot.  Have to wonder about aliens as car hops.  The preacher could have been reading or mouthing the words from the Bible rather than staring at it during the funeral.  I guess I could go on and on about some of the very out-in-the-open errors.  My cinematography teacher told me that you can use that movie to see how not-to-make-a-movie.  See it when you have nothing better to do.,1111017600,,619,4.247863247863248

In fact, it is so bad that it takes serious commitment to sit through the whole thing!  I would say that it is excruciatingly painful (to the mind) to watch this movie.  It is horrendous!  But that's why we all watch it, isn't it?

It is indeed terrible, full of blatantly incorrect ""scientific"" information.  It is worth seeing just for the speeches towards the end - completely hysterical!

However, I would like to point out that the *documentary* of Plan 9, which is included in this version, is at least as poorly made a film as Plan 9 itself.  The documentary is a farce.  I turned it off after about three minutes of fast-forwarding.

So you've been warned about Plan 9 - see it if you dare!",1110067200,3,800,4.417808219178082
595386,5,6303170498,"When I first encountered this unique item on late-night TV back in the 1970s, it moved me as no other film could.  I was one of the people who voted for it as the worst film of all time when the Medved Brothers compiled ""The 50 Worst Films of All Time.""  Sadly, Michael Medved has devolved into a predictable, knee-jerk ""social critic"" for conservative media.  The younger brother, Harry, apparently fell off the Earth.

But none of this diminishes the glory of ""Plan 9.""  Writer-director Ed Wood pulls every one of his tricks out for this one: a ludicrous premise; disjointed editing; wretched sets; and sappy dialogue for inept actors.  I would call the special effects the bottom scrapings from the barrel, but that would insult the barrel.

There's always a pathetic underbelly to an Ed Wood production, but nearly every time he overcomes it with his unique, infamous, possibly insane spirit of dedication.  He's not trying to make the worst films, or aiming for camp, but that's what happens time and again!

What makes ""Plan 9"" stand out as his masterpiece (though ""Bride of the Monster"" offers stiff competition) is hard to define precisely.  Sometimes a movie just gels, like ""Casablanca"" did.  All the elements belong, as if the Fates has conspired in a never-to-be-repeated moment of artistic magic.

Sure, you can't go too wrong with Tor Johnson and ""UFOs"" clearly dangling from strings.  Leather-suited aliens raise the dead for their own secret purposes, while cardboard tombstones totter and the chiropractor of someone's wife holds a cape over his face in a failed attempt to pretend he's Bela Lugosi.  Criswell the prophet intones, ""Can you prove that it didn't happen?""  I can't!

I have watched this movie under many different circumstances, and it never fails to entertain.  Some people don't appreciate what they might call ""stupid,"" ""boring,"" or ""stupid and boring.""  But for some of us, it awakens in the soul the feeling that we are not alone in being misunderstood in an incomprehensible universe.  Plus there are laughs.",1110067200,5,2045,4.961764705882353
595387,5,6303170498,"""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is without a doubt Ed Wood's most hilariously incompetent movie - if you only see one of his epics, make it this one.

The story, if it really matters, is about aliens determined to destroy the earth before scientists discover the 'solarmanite' bomb, which can destroy sunlight and, apparently, the universe. A true classic of unintentional comedy.

Now, the time has come for you to discover the truth about (insert drum roll here) Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space."" You know you need to watch this film if for no other reason than to finally learn whether Wood's magnum opus is indeed the worst film ever made. Now, gather in closely and I'll whisper to you a little secret about this science fiction extravaganza: ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" most definitely is NOT the worst film ever put on celluloid, and I can with utmost confidence assist you in discovering dozens of other films far inferior to this one if you so wish. For instance, ""Invasion of the Blood Farmers"" is a movie much worse than ""Plan 9."" ""Superman IV"" is a worse film than ""Plan 9."" But ""Gigli,"" despite what you might think, is better than ""Plan 9"" even though many of us wish it were worse. I could name many, many more films that make Wood's movie look like ""Citizen Kane"" by comparison. I think this film gets its reputation because critics need one shining example upon which to pin their fears and hatreds, one example which provides a common touchstone that transcends cultures and languages.

The plot is simplicity itself. Humanity's quest to build bigger and better bombs has put an alien race in a tizzy. Advanced far beyond our levels of technology, these extraterrestrials decided some time ago to stop us from developing any more weapons. They tried, in fact, to create eight plans aimed at preventing us from destroying the planet and the entire solar system. All of them failed, so the next plan--the titular Plan 9--is a real doozy. Relying on the electron beams and pineal glands (cackles), the aliens resurrect three dead people to scare us into submission. One of these reanimated corpses is a recently deceased woman who looks like a vampire (played by ""Vampira""). Her distraught husband soon follows her into the grave and back again. He's referred to in the credits as Ghoul Man, but he's really the legendary Bela Lugosi in a few scenes. The weird events at the cemetery bring in the police, specifically Inspector Dan Clay (Tor Johnson), who also perishes only to return from the dead as last member of the alien's shock troops. Of course, you can't have zombies shambling around a cemetery for long without the local population asking a lot of pesky questions.

Enter into the picture a married couple living next to the graveyard, Jeff and Paula Trent (Gregory Walcott and Mona McKinnon respectively). Jeff's a pilot for a civilian firm who witnessed a UFO at the beginning of the film, but he has little idea how this sighting will eventually change his life. Then there are the military types who know all about the visiting UFOs and are taking several laughable steps to deal with the menace. How much danger does the world face from these beings? Not much, apparently. Wood treats us to numerous shots of the saucers zipping about the planet, saucers that look exactly like paper plates hanging from strings swinging back and forth against a phony stock footage backdrop. When we finally meet the aliens responsible for this impending catastrophe, we can't help but wonder how exactly we should define the word ""advanced."" Eros (Dudley Manlove) and his curvy female assistant Tanna (Joanna Lee) land their craft in the graveyard in order to better control the execution of Plan 9. Eventually, after much hilarious exposition, military officers and Jeff Trent penetrate the spacecraft to learn from the arrogant Eros that earth is about to invent a bomb that will explode sunlight! A struggle ensues resulting in the destruction of Plan 9, and all is well with the world.

All will not be well with viewers forced to sit through this monstrosity. ""Plan 9"" is a great movie because its so bad in every element of its execution. The acting, pace, special effects, cinematography, dialogue, and lighting are so mediocre as to boggle the imagination. Take, for instance, Bela Lugosi. He died shortly after filming the first few scenes we see him in, so Wood brought in another guy to play his part. Every time we see Ghoul Man, he's holding his cape over his face so we won't know that the character isn't Lugosi. Oh my. Then there's the sudden changes from night to day and back again all in the space of one scene, the paper plate flying saucers, the heavy use of stock footage, and tombstones obviously made from cardboard. My favorite ""Oh brother!"" moment? Noticing that the advanced alien spacecraft contains high technology powered by vacuum tubes. Wow! These guys are light years ahead of us without having to rely on transistors! The lame dialogue--too many examples exist to cite here--achieves such heights of banality that you will need to replay the scenes in order to make sure you heard it right the first time.

I liked this DVD version. The extras included interviews with many of the principals involved in the recent ""Ed Wood"" film along with surviving cast members from ""Plan 9"" as well as recollections from a film historian about Wood's oeuvre. Trailers from nearly every extant Wood film, as well as an interview with Bela Lugosi conducted at the time of his release from an alcohol treatment facility, found space on this disc.

WHY IT'S BAD?: Despite the fact that Ed Wood may have been trying very hard to make a film about bloodsucking vampires from outer space, he succeeded in producing one of the most ill-conceived, poorly written, amateurishly acted films in Hollywood history. I won't go into the details about the film (paper plate spaceships, chiropractor stand-in for Lugosi, etc., etc.) as many others have and they have been covered in-depth over the years.

WHY IT'S GOOD?: Well, somehow Ed Wood managed to combine all the above elements to make one of the most bizarre, surreal, campy films I have ever seen. I actually find this film highly entertaining but, of course, not for any reasons Ed Wood ever intended. The strange combination of pointless, misguided and poorly edited scenes featuring horrible, third-rate special effects and awful acting in some odd way works to create something fun to watch.

Now, if Ed Wood had only called this film a comedy and said he was intending to parody all the atomic age sci-fi films of the 50s he might have been branded a genius.

...or did he?

Honestly, you have to give the man credit. He got a movie made in Hollywood with his name on it. Granted, it's not Shakespeare. It's not even normal 50s sci-fi. Audiences of the time probably thought it was the worst movie they had ever seen. But today, looking back on it is a fun experience because you can't stop laughing.

You'll find the most cheesy special effects, dialogue, and sets that have ever graced the screen. But yet, you'll be amused that such a bad movie could ever got made and was taken seriously by the writer/producer/director, and you'll end up enjoying it as a comedy. Maybe it wasn't what Ed Wood intended, but nevertheless the film has left a legacy that will be remembered as long as film is remembered.

What I did find interesting is how much Ed Wood paid attention to UFOlogy. It wasn't elaborate, but he did have government cover ups in the plot, dialogue with common real-life descriptions of UFOs (cigar-shaped objects, etc.), and he even tipped his hat to the metal of the flying saucers being made out of some sort of unworldly metal - like what's been claimed about the Roswell wreckage of 1947.

The film itself has a good picture, although the sound is still mono. It contains a 2-hour film documentary that's really informative and interesting. It looked like it was made in the 80s though. Even so, it has plenty interesting facts, and plenty of interviews with Vampira in her old age as well as interviews from other cast members still alive. It even contains the only film footage of Ed Wood making a movie. Well worth watching.

The so-called 40-minute bonus show, ""The Ed Wood Story"" is a collection of six interview segments that you scroll through and watch. It's deceptive to suggest that this is a documentary. At least half of it is interesting -- and only half of it is even about Mr. Wood himself! The man is discussed, but Johnny Depp talks more about the making of the film, ""Ed Wood"", Martin Landau mainly discusses his portrayal of Bela Lugosi, the real Bela Lugosi is seen in a long-ish clip discussing his discharge from rehab. It's a mixed bag of stuff that is not even slapped together. Bonus interview clips, yes...bonus ""show"", not quite.

The trailers (Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, Sinister Urge, The Bride and the Beast) are fun, but a couple of them looked like they were transferred from a 6-hour speed VHS tape.

595469,5,6303170498,"In fact besides I'd go as far as to say this is perhaps the most competent Ed Wood movie around. Sure there are glaring errors such as Bela running back and forth to the grave in broad daylight ( when it's supposed to be night-time ) and his replacement is obvious ( come on, he's at least 4 inches taller I reckon ). And indeed the last 20 minutes descended into a farce that unfortunately sunk the film. Yes, it shows a degree of ineptitude on Ed's part but for most of the film there was an almost professional air to how the actors acted.
Ed thought that he'll be remembered for this film. This was his big one and he's right, it's the one we remember him most for. However I don't think he would have liked the tag it's been given but if you want to be remembered he certainly went about the right way in doing it ( even if the results were all wrong )
But if we start at the start with Bela's last real scene where he mourns his lover's death - that was a really touching scene. The emotion in that looks too real that it can't be described as fake or cardboard cut out. If anything that was the most poignant scene Ed ever captured on film. He may have been an inept film-maker but that was a stroke of genius - no kidding!
I get the feeling Ed cast Vampira as Lugosi's wife mainly because if you've seen the Tim Burton movie you'll know that Lugosi thought she was "" a honey "" and it was certainly a nice gesture to Bela to do that. Vampira doesn't have to do much in this film. Just walk really slowly and look ominous whenever the camera is on her. Looks beautiful while doing so I have to admit. I'm almost certain that she inspired George Romero to make Night of The Living Dead by her walking alone.
Criswell makes his appearance in this film and you have to say, him, along with Vampira and Tor, got almost uncanny lookalikes in Tim Burton's biopic that it seems almost spooky.
Hats off to whoever had the idea of using saucer lids for um the use of flying saucers. Really neat and easily identified even if it was black and white. Still not too bad a job. Oh and who could forget Saturn as a ballbearing - Top Class!
The last 20 minutes are a farce as I've said before mainly because it's supposed to be a showdown between the humans and the aliens....or to be more precise 3 men with guns and a man and a woman in funny clothing that are supposed to be aliens. The acting here is horrifically poor and despite it all being passionately acted it just seems.....well a bit silly. And whatever niggling doubts you had about the film leading up to the last 20 minutes, will no doubt be exposed by the end. A shame because the film showed Ed at his most coherent. And that sadly was the pinnacle of Ed's career.
So all in all it's not the worst movie of all time and certainly not the worst you'll ever see ( unless you're a connoisseur of good taste and in that case what the hell are you reading this for ). Definitely his most enjoyable film. Now if someone could only just tell Criswell to shut up ( I wish Ed had tried, honestly try to do that ).
But for Ed, this would be his shot at greatness and while it backfired, it was about as good as he could make it. Perhaps if he were making these now and not 40 years ago he might have gotten away with it. And I'm sure Ben Affleck would have been great as the dumb pilot if it were made now. Think about it
Here's to Ed though - he may not have been the greatest but he sure knew how to entertain us",1090022400,2,3462,4.115214180206794
595470,5,6303170498,"How does one describe a movie such as this? Like ""Robot Monster,"" it is a masterpiece, and like ""Robot Monster,"" this is not because ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" has even a shadow of an ounce of quality to it. Rather, this is an example of just how wrong everything in any creative project can go if it is in the hands of the right angora-wearing genius.
For nothing (and I mean NOTHING) came out right in this movie. Continuity? Hah! Realistic dialogue? Pish! Convincing acting? Gah! Remotely realistic special effects? Heaven forbid! No, what Ed Wood gave us with ""Plan 9"" is quite simply a cinematic failure that not even Orson Wells could have duplicated if he had tried. In what other movie is one of your stars dead even before the script is written or shooting begins?
No, ""Plan 9"" is unique, a thing that we mere mortals can only begin to try and understand. Instead we can only watch, transfixed and trembling in awe that Wood's vision was transmitted so perfectly to the silver screen. This is a movie that well deserves to be ranked among the immortal creations of motion picture history, despite or perhaps because of the fact that it completely lacks any of the features that would normally merit such an inclusion.

595471,3,6303170498,"Also known as ""Grave Robbers From Outer Space"", Edward D. Wood's masterpiece of horrific filmmaking has been called the ""worst movie ever made"" by more than a few critics and movie fans. This hasn't kept this unintentially hilarious sci-fi dud from becoming a massive cult classic. And rightfully so. Ed Wood's art for making movies so bad that they're actually good has never been more apparent than it is here.
""Plan 9"" revolves around a couple of space invaders in bad suits who fly around in spaceships on strings and resurrect the recently dead to haunt the inhabits of a small town where it seems to go back and forth from night to day a lot. The humans aren't having it though as a joint team of the local police, military, and an overacting airline pilot refuse to be terrorized by the undead creatures (who can't decide whether they're ghouls or vampires). But these visitors from a badly-drawn planet resembling Saturn have their own intentions. They're hear to warn us of a new solar-powered weapon that the Earth will eventually create and wipe out the universe. But our heroes aren't going down without a fight. They've got enough army movie stock footage to send them aliens back where they came from.
What makes ""Plan 9"" so entertainingly terrible? Where do I start? There's the overly-descriptive narration of Criswell who practically gives play-by-play for every action in the film. You've got Bela Lugosi who appears courtesy of silent footage recorded before his death and with the help of a stand-in who looks nothing like him. And who could forget those cooky cops who don't allow the discovery of their Captain's horrifying death to damper their moods any? Also there's Duke Moore's hards-as-nails detective who fearlessly uses his gun to fix his hat when necessary. From the bargain basement graveyard chalk full of cardboard headstones to the hungry young overactors spitting out silly dialouge, ""Plan 9"" is truly the ""Citizen Kane of bad movies"".
For those looking to pick this gem up on DVD, the Image edition is the only way to go. Not only is the picture the best that it's ever looked but it comes with a feature-length documentary, ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion"" and the trailer for the movie.

me. After viewing for myself with an open mind,I find it rather
entertaining. Yes it is silly in spots. But remeber! This is
science fiction which is supposed to be fantasy and not reality.
To bad not too many people accept science fiction as such. In
this picture,(obviously made on a shoestring budget)Wood demon-
strates what a little imagination combined with little money can
do. I found the acting to be great,the plot well defined and it
moved gracefully to it's climax. But I think the best thing about
the movie was the message it left for us all as regards to human
character. Quite frankly we are all stupid with regards to our
personal prejudices and all we think about is making weapons
of one kind or another to destroy somebody. Otherwise,the movie
is great. I take my hat off to Ed Wood as a genius who had a
great imagination regardless of his lifestyle. Maybe the moral

This classic creation from the brilliant mind of Ed Wood is about as good as it gets. A masterpiece in every sense of the word, Plan 9 from outer space is a piece of art.
A terrifying threat from outer space comes with the power to make the dead come alive. One by one, the undead are being brought back to terrorise the living. The police are sent to investigate the strange happenings in the cemetary. Will they be able to stop the body snatchers from outer space!!
Tor Johnson gives the performance of his lifetime as the inspector Dan Clay, he's totally believable and mind numbingly horrific as he is brought back from the dead. Vampira also shines in her role as - vampire girl! You may have nightmares and not be able to shake off the memories of her terrifying visage as she walks and stalks her prey.
This is also the last chance to view the mighty Bela Lugosi as he gives his final performance here. It's only a brief part as he is seen grieving his dead wife at the beginning, as he sadly died before filming finished his part was then played by a chiropractor friend of a friend of Ed Wood. Look out also for a powerful cameo by the director playing the guy holding a newspaper.
Be warned, this film is not for the faint of heart, horror fans only please for this lesson in terror is almost too much to bear!!
Ok, seriously folks, this is the best of the best of ""B"" grade sclock that has been produced. There are more laughs to be had here than the average Hollywood ""comedy"" and it's a true joy to behold the master in his top form here. Witness night turn to day then back to night in the graveyard. Marvel at Tor Johnson's mumbling as ""Lobo"" gets to finally speak. Watch as cardboard gravestones are knocked over by the bumbling cast. Hear the hysterics of the alien leader and above all be entertained by this wonderful movie by the king of the B grades himself - Edward D. Wood Jnr.

This is definitely not the worst movie ever made, but it would certainly have been forgotten if not for the fact that it was labelled as the worst movie ever.  The ample narration in this movie gave the movie a documentary favor which was probably intended.  The special effects were cheesy, so what.  The acting and dialogue were reminence of high school production.  Some facial expressions were priceless.  All these are indications that the movie was made quickly with a low budget, which it was.  I liked this movie more than, say, The Hulk.  I did not fall asleep watching Plan 9, which I did twice watching The Hulk.
This DVD also featured a documentary about the film.  The documentary was decent.  It featured some of the actors and actresses years after the film was made.",1082160000,2,836,4.703448275862069
595543,5,6303170498,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the DVD only makes it better. I was first shown 'Plan 9' by my high school drama teacher, and have adored it ever since. When it was shown to our drama class it was used as example of how not to do everything associated with a dramatic production. Since then I have watched it on VHS many times and have seen all of Wood's other works as well. I am quite a believer in Ed Wood as disillusioned anti-genius, a man who knew he wanted to make a movie but didn't know how to make a movie, nor had any of the right tools for making a movie, yet persevered happily in his craft. I regret that he died before his films gave him the notoriety he so richly deserved.
'Plan 9' involves aliens (including the hilarious over-actor Dudley Manlove), and the resurrection of the dead through 'an electrode shot through the pinion pituitary' of recently deceased people, in this case Tor Johnson and Vampira, who will somehow keep the human race from discovering the 'solarminite' and exploding the whole universe. The sets are dreadful, the acting is unbelievably inept, and the whole production is crowned with the silliest dialogue (by Wood, of course) imaginable. All in all it adds up to a great time and a camp classic. The movie was popularized as 'The Worst Movie Ever Made' in the book ""The Golden Turkey Awards"" by Harry and Michael Medved. Some people are irritated with the brothers Medved for that pronouncement, but understand that it was the result of a poll of their readers.
I personally think there are two basic groups of bad movies, movies that are bad but fun to watch (the famed 'so bad they're good' category), of which 'Plan 9' unquestionably leads the pack; and the alternative 'just plain unwatchable' type of bad movie, which are never fun to watch. I think that the beauty of 'Plan 9' is that Wood and his goofy assortment of friends and followers persevered and actually made this film. It wasn't good, but I argue that there is no way that it's the worst movie ever made for one simple reason: it entertained me. The very worst thing a film can do is to bore the audience, and despite it's flaws, 'Plan 9' never bores the audience; they may laugh at it and find certain components difficult to believe, but it is never boring. I think 'Plan 9' is actually one of the more genuinely interesting films I have ever seen, albeit, for all the reasons Wood never intended. Mind you, I am not mocking Ed Wood; I genuinely appreciate his giving us his body of work, particularly 'Plan 9', though 'Night of the Ghouls' is virtually as silly as this one.
This truly is Wood's 'Citizen Kane', and the DVD has a wonderful two hour documentary from the early 1990s on Wood and the making of 'Plan 9', including a tour of the decrepit soundstage where the interiors were shot, and interviews with actors from the film, notably Vampira and Paul Marco (Kelton the cop from three separate Wood movies, including 'Plan 9') where a picture of Wood as a somewhat manic, innovative filmmaker emerges. The consensus seems to be that Ed was a nice guy that everybody liked despite his problems with alcohol and transvestism. Also included is the wonderful original trailer for the film, which is hysterical in its own right.
This is a wonderful DVD, and I recommend it to anyone. 'Plan 9' is suitable for all audiences, but I particularly recommend it for people who can grasp the concept of a film so very bad that it's good. There are many inept filmmakers both past and present, but there will never be another Ed Wood!",1080432000,5,3564,4.552959501557632

However, I also have to say that I think Edward D. Wood, Jr was on the right track as far as the message goes (against nuclear weapons and war). This is a must-see for anyone, especially students studying filmmaking or acting because it shows quite clearly what NOT to do.

How can it be Wood's ""best film"", yet the ""worst movie of all time""? It really isn't. Wood made lots of films that were ten times as worse than PLAN 9 and there are a lot of movies being churned out in theatres today that are just awful. If nothing else, PLAN 9 is amusing and at least has a story, convoluted as it is. Besides, it was the last film Bela Lugosi ever made.

The plot revolves around some aliens who are resurrecting dead people to have them kill other people they can resurrect so that they can teach the Earthlings a lesson. That pretty much sums it up. What that summary doesn't include are all the great visual gags: from the flying saucer plates on string to doors without any doorknobs. It's all fun, fun, fun.
Ed Wood was a filmmaker with a passion to make movies. He wanted to make movies, so he did. Had he been alive today, he probably would be a fairly famous filmmaker and not the shunned director he later became.

PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE is bizarre and kind of dumb. However, it's also hilarious to watch and is better than many movies being made today. If nothing else, it's worth watching for it's place in movie canon.",1077235200,,1290,4.282786885245901

Here's a rundown of the plot: aliens want to bring earthlings to the bargaining table, and to achieve this they reanimate the dead.  The extra-terrestrials hope that the fear of seeing walking dead will force the governments of Earth to...oh, it doesn't really matter.  You see, this is a movie where a ""detective"" scratches his neck with the barrel of his revolver, night and day repeatedly alternate within scenes, and flying pilots speak to the ground crew on an actual telephone.

If you have seen Tim Burton's film Ed Wood, you already know what it took to get this film to release, and can skip this paragraph.

The movie focuses around aliens who orchestrate a plan to resurrect the dead to scare earthlings and show them their power.  Nobody is safe when these mindless and very dull zombies create havoc all over town.  It's up to the police and the government to put an end to the aliens' plans before things get more out of hand in this uproariously terrible film that leaves you wanting more.
I wanted to see this as soon as I saw Tim Burton's ""Ed Wood.""  I knew that this was something I would have to see.  And trust me, the movie wasn't over exaggerating on how goofy this film gets.  The flaws are so in-your-face that you cannot help but laugh hysterically.  First it's night, then it's daytime, then night, then daytime, and so on and so on.  Bela Lugosi died before the film started, but never fear!  Ed Wood used an extra (his wife's chiropractor who covers his face the whole time) and earlier shots of the late actor that don't even match up with what's going on in the movie!  The acting is cheesy and horrendous, but that only adds to the unexpected glory of this cult-classic.
Although it is deemed as ""the worst movie"" in Hollywood history, I really don't think it is.  As bad as it is, it is not the worst movie in the world.  And I don't believe that Ed Wood's the worst director ever.  The difference between him and so many of the directors today was the absolute passion he had.  He so much wanted to tell stories and share them with the world.  It's a shame that he is the end of many jokes and gags today, but then again, maybe he wouldn't mind.

That is more than I can say about some of the trash that is coming out of Hollywood these days.  The film is bad. . . Big Deal!  Ed Wood put together a ""cult classic"" on a very limited budget.  There was no waste with Ed; he used everything.  Of course, most of the time his ""techniques"" fell short of the mark.  But, then again, we must remember:  Ed gave us the best he could do, and, for this, we are grateful.
I am sure that if Ed were alive today, he would be tickled pink that we still remember him.  Ed Wood was loyal to his people; and his people were loyal to him.  Maybe, as one reviewer pointed out, Ed Wood was simply too nice a guy to be a great director.
This film has been named the worst film of its time.  That's all right.  As far as I am concerned, it takes a bit of talent to make a film like this -- ""ad hoc"" dialog, faulty props, acting that was. . . . well . . . . you know, and; at a cheap budget to boot.
Say what you would about this film, but, given a low budget; this film is entertaining -- even though it is ""terrible.""
I don't know if I would call this film ""the worst"" of its kind.  There was a real stinker about ""Ro-Man,"" a robot-like creature who wears an ape suit and a space helmet.  Now, THAT was bad!
From a technical standpoint, ""Plan 9"" might be bad.  But, it does have some enjoyable moments in it.  And, yes, it is entertaining.  Ed, Vampira, Bela, Crishwell. . . for what you had to work with, you did good!  And, Ed, you are sorely missed.",1052697600,,1619,3.996875
595654,4,6303170498,"When I was a child I asked my father, an avid movie fan, what was the worst movie he's ever seen. Without even pausing he said 'Plan 9'. He told me of a director name Ed Wood, who has long been known as the worst director ever.
  Years later I had the plesure of seeing this film for my self, I now own it.
  The movie opens with Criswell, a wildly inacurate physcic, giving the world one of the most insane line ever ""We are all interested in the future for that is where we will be spending the rest of our lives."" right then I knew this wasn't going to be just another bad film.
From there the movie gets even worse.
  The main thrust of the fil is that aliens from another planet are comming to this planet to try and stop us from developing a bomb that could cause the worlds, and the universe's destruction. The premis of the film is an interseting one. Much like The Day The Earth Stood Still was about aliens trying to save us from ourselves. However that movie didn't have such amazing actors like, Vampira, Tor Johnson and Dudley Manlove the worst overactor I have ever witnessed. This movie also has police leaving in one car and showing up in another, wobbling grave stones, and paper plate spaceships.
  One of the biggest selling points of this film was that it was Bela Logusi's last film. Ed Wood had only a few shots of Bela but that didn't stop him from giving him top billing. And considering that most of the shots that had Bela in them made almost no sense in the film so he had a doctor, with a full head of hair and a good foot taller than Bela, stand in for him by putting a care in front of his face.
  This movie is the typical 'it's so bad it's good' film. Every time you watch it you find more mistakes and see things that you missed.
  This is the movie that people look at when people talk about Ed Wood. This is most likely the worst film ever made and for that Wood will live forever.
P.S. Rent the movie ED WOOD By Tim Burton with Johnny Deep as Wood and Martin Landau (who recived and oscar for the role) as Bela Lugosi.",1048291200,2,2054,4.159090909090909
595655,5,6303170498,"To my knowledge, there are two different releases of ""Plan 9"" out there, and choosing the right one can make all the difference in the world.  The release from Image Entertainment, which includes the 110-minute documentary ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood"" is THE version to purchase.  I would not recommend the other, Passport Video's release that includes the 40-minute documentary ""The Ed Wood Story.""  Firstly, the film itself has a much better presentation in the Image version; a cleaner print with better audio and, unlike Passport Video, there is no company logo on-screen throughout the film!  Both releases give you the classic ""Plan 9"" trailers.  However, only the Image release gives you the truly wonderful documentary ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood.""  A heartfelt, low budget look at the making of this anti-masterpiece, this special is longer than the film itself and overs amazing insight into society's continuing fascination with the ""worst movie ever made.""  Passport's doc, ""The Ed Wood Story,"" is a shoddy rehash of publicity material for the Johnny Depp movie and overs little substance.  Believe me--choosing the right DVD version makes ALL the difference.  And as far as buying ""Plan 9"" at all?  Well, you simply must... because it is a classic, and you'll find yourself quoting its insipid dialogue for weeks on end.  Since purcahsing it a year ago, I have probably watched it at least four full times.  It never gets stale because there's always something new to laugh at.

This is plan 9!  This is the one that worked!  The WORSE movie EVER made!""  And now that I've actually seen this movie....it DOES work, and it IS the worst movie ever made.
Ed Wood's vision of the ultimate alien vendetta against Earth is hilarious!  Plan 9 is possibly the worst movie ever made but only if you try to take it seriously.  If you don't, you will definitely get a good evening's entertainment!  Who could forget these classic lines:
Captain:  ....what could they want?  what could be the reason for their visit?
Private:  Visit?  Why, that would mean visitors.

595658,5,6303170498,"Okay, so eveyone has heard of Ed Wood's Plan 9 From Outer Space and they should all have heard that people often consider this to be the worst movie of all time. As far as I can see, it is not that bad. I will go as far as saying it is brilliant - in a comedic sense of course.
I have seen films that are a whole lot worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space. The Christmas classic ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"" comes to mind. What makes Plan 9 such a classic (and Ed Wood's WORSE films lesser known) is that it is an excellent example of a film where everything that could have possibly gone wrong did go wrong.
Firstly, the funding for the film came from some goodly Christians who wanted to make some biblical films. In true Ed Wood style, he conned them into funding a film to do with aliens and a ridiculous plan to wake up zombies. Then he decided that some old stock footage of his long time collaborator Bela Legosi would make it an excellent chance for fans to see Bela Legosi's 'last' film.
Then things just get more and more ridiculous. Ed Wood gets a stand-in for Bela who covers his face unconvincingly to make the audience believe it is indeed Bela Legosi. An all-star cast including Tor Johnson, Vampira and Criswell bring new lows to acting. Ed Wood's script writing is at it best here. Watch as the aliens reason with the rather foolish humans. Watch in complete disbelief as the sets shake and cardboard gravestones fall over. laugh yourself silly as you day/night continuity gets worse and worse. Shake your head in complete horror at the broomstick and barstool that is supposed to be the cockpit of a plane.
Besides the flaws, this film does have an almost literary quality about it; Ed Wood attempts to try and give us a message behind the story. It is a message of peace; a humble attempt at stopping the creation of weapons of mass destruction. I think in the uncertain times of the early 21st Century, this is a message that is more relevant today than it was then. Besides, there is not more entertaining way to discuss the topic!

There's whole web-sites dedicated to this turkey that's so bad, it's got cult status. There was one site that listed all the faults in this film (and there's hundreds); such as people get into a car and it's daytime, you see them drive along and it's night, and when they get out, it's daytime again. Either they had no one checking continuity or that's one hell of a long drive!
The special FX are terrible, as are the sets... the interior of the space-ship has a curtain for a door, and a desk for a control console.
The plot? Aliens come to earth to resurect the undead. Bela Lugosi has a small role in this (I think he died during the making of it).

You can't turn it off no matter how many times you say to yourself that you will. And then, to top it off, you find yourself showing it to friends who fall into the same trap. You just look over at each other and shake your head with your mouth open and then return your attention to the screen. Ed Wood reached the apex of his nadir in this one; the hokey backgrounds, the ridiculous characters, the moronic dialogue and the idiotic plot twists make you laugh so hard that you're embarrassed. The special effects would be considered poor by High School film class standards and yet therein lies its charm. Wood doesn't try to make this movie more than it was. At the time it was a terrible stigma to be exiled into one of these films, yet, besides Dracula, what other film is Lugosi remembered for? And, by the way, just who was that guy behind the cape that took over for Lugosi as Ghoul Man? You know, it is said that Lugosi still haunts the crummy hotel on Sunset Blvd. where he died of a heroin overdose while making this film . . . OOOOOO!! . . .

a)  night and day are interchangeable
b)  one of the main characters dies before the film is completed and is played for the remainder by the director's chiropractor (cape drawn across face of course!)
c)  flying saucers appear to be two styrofoam plates glued together and suspended by very visible wires
d)  these same *futuristic* spaceships contain items that appear to have been taken directly out of Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory
e)  horrendous incidental 'music' and painfully obvious military training out-takes used in the 'battle' scenes (LOL)

Wood Jr. was not just an ordinary director. He was perhaps the most passionate director ever to arrive in Hollywood. It is obvious this devotion made him very likable; otherwise no one would work for him and his films would never be made. This film in particular, is definitely not overrated; for sheer entertainment, it's hard to find a better deal (especially as I got the DVD here [inexpensively]). You want to imagine this movie? Here is how to make something resembling it. Get yourself a copy of the script for ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Now open it in Microsoft Word and select ""Autosummarize"". Read through the script to make sure it is desirably inconsistent, silly, and poor. Got that? Now go over to the mall, grab about 30 people who what to be in a movie, and shoot it. Done already? Haven't you made an exquisite masterpiece? Anyone? Bueller? Bueller? Doesn't have that special touch of diseased craftsmanship and love does it? That is Wood's gift. He crafted dreadful lines that he must have known I'd be writing about 40 years later; ""You'll be up there, but I'll be safe in there"" and Cristo's tense-switching, pause-fraught opening monologue immediately come to mind. Included on the disk, if you buy the purple one with Vampira on the cover, is a fascinating documentary expounding on the genius Ed Wood was and what his significance is today.",1023926400,3,1524,4.690298507462686

Truly it is a god-awful movie that is characterized by abysmal acting, scripting, directing, and the cheesiest of special effects.  Having said that, I now distinguish PLAN 9 from other horrendously poor movies which ought never see the light of day.  Films of this latter category, CALIGULA comes to mind, are marked with more than just the shortcomings noted above.  These movies are truly painful to watch as they desensitize the audience with the utter seriousness of cast, crew, and director, all of whom collaborate to produce a film that holds any viewer in total contempt.  Movies like PLAN 9 or ROBOT MONSTER are fun to watch.  Not even a low-intelligence viewer can possibly take seriously Bela Lugosi's chiropractor who held a black cape across his face to hide the absence caused by Lugosi's unfortunate death.  Further,for a movie to be bad enough to be good, that movie must have some truly oddball characters.  PLAN 9 has its share: Tor Johnson, the behemoth ex-wrestler who staggers about the set with the same twisted grin that he used before bodyslamming an opponent in the ring; Vampira, the tiny-waisted sexpot who radiated all the fake menace of a Holloween body suit; and then the immortal Dudley Manlove, who boasted of a new weapon that could destroy the universe.  Most reviewers go into some detail about the plot and how the actors interact with each other and with the audience. With films like PLAN 9, no mention of plot is needed.  All the viewer needs to know is that this category of film requires its own value system.  And perhaps that is the inner lesson toward which director Ed Wood subconsciously if not hilariously groped: that a multitude of conditions requires a multitude of responses.

595732,2,6303170498,"While it can be argued that this movie is so bad it is good, I cannot with good conscience give this movie more than a generous two stars.  Having endured Manos: The Hands Of Fate, I can authoritatively declare that Plan 9 From Outer Space is not the worst movie ever made.  Still, what this movie brings to your screen is bad acting, terrible scripting, exceedingly cheap sets and special effects, and an incredibly annoying, arrogant narrator of events.  The authorities go on and on about the terrible mutilation of the murder victims they discover, yet not only is there no blood, there is not even the faintest scratch to be seen when the camera pans over the bodies.  While the use of dangling hubcaps for spaceships is bad enough, the fact that the airline pilot witness describes them as cigar-shaped is . . . just weird.  When your headliner is Tor Johnson, you know you're in trouble.  Having seen several Tor movies, I sort of like the big guy for some strange reason.  He actually has lines early in this one, and it soon becomes obvious why spoken lines and Tor Johnson just don't belong together.  In honor of Tor, I feel compelled to describe the movie's plot in Tor's unique idiomatic language: Woman die.  Man die.  UFO come to cemetery.  Dead people walk again.  Tor die.  Tor walk again.  Police come.  Day and night change every five minutes.  Army men come.  Spacemen come make fun of humans.  Movie ends.
Believe it or not, this film actually does have a social conscience (which is not necessarily a good thing).  Of course, the best way to get men to do away with nuclear weapons is probably not to tell them how stupid they are.  It saddens me to see Bela Lugosi end his career this way; he gets no lines and is forced to cry over the death of his wife (the incredibly tiny-wasted Vampira).  Worst of all, Lugosi died during the filming and was replaced in some segments by someone who looks nothing like him.
There are only three reasons to watch this movie: 1) to laugh at its pervasive ineptness, 2) to see if it is as bad as everyone says it is (the answer is yes), or 3) to learn how not to make a movie.",1022630400,,2134,4.434447300771208
595733,4,6303170498,"""Plan 9"" was not meant to be watched over and over again on home entertainment systems. It was a simply a movie that, in the fifties, usually screened on Saturdays with two others, besides! True, ""Plan 9"" appeared a lot of times, but that was because the audiences really appeared to enjoy it.
I lived in West L.A at the time, a time when people actually rode their horses into Palms(the nearest movie house to us) and hitched their mares to the post in front of the theatre)
In this context, I don't think anyone in the audience, mostly children, noticed these technical errors written of. Most were caused by the low budget. Placing characters outside, even at high noon, requires expensive lighting and placing them outside at night really costs.
In any event, the two stars of the movie, Wolcott and Manlove(?!?) didn't do that bad if you are young, quite innocent, and have your pretty cousin sitting next to you. After forty years, I still remembered some of the dialogue!
Yes, Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Lucas, with their seventy million dollar budgets, make the slick movies with the better actors and minus the rough edges. Mr. Wood seems to have used what he HAD to conceive of plots that would justify using them. The ""sexy"" feminine leads(My Gosh, Tanna, really needed to keep her rump out of the camera frame,and the wife, who seems okay at first but, by the end, seems more like some librarian from Kansas), also adds little here. But we were more interested in those cool space craft and I'll bet more than one person my age tried, then, to make his own--based on the rather sere sets that Wood used. Tor needed some work on his grammer ""I got be looking around."" and Manlove goes way over the edge, but Wolcott really does okay for what he had to work with.
Not for adults, then, unless you want to see how a lack of money can affect a movie. A great piece of nostalgia from the fifties.",1021593600,2,1898,4.520348837209302

  When Criswell say's ""We are all interested in the future for that is were we will spend the rest of our lives"" you know that with writing like that you are in for a trip.
  The movie is written,produced,and directed by Edward D. Wood Jr. Ed would go down in history as the worst director of all time. The plot is at least an interesting one. Aliens come to earth to stop us from making a bomb that will destroy the universe. At face this is not a bad plot. However in the hands of Ed Wood you know no good will come of it. And it doesn't.
  Some of the worst diolauge ever is right here in this movie like-
""Don't worry you'll be up there, and i'll be in there' and they'll be up there.""
""You humans are stupid, stupid, stupid.""
""Well one thing's for sure. The captins dead. Murdered. And somones responsible.""
  There is more over acting in this movie than ever on one screen. The addition of cult fav Tor Johnson as a police captin is really funny as is vampira who whould not talk in the film.
  As you may know the late Bella Lagosi is in the movie for all of tem minutes and get's top billing. Bella, at this time broke and hooked on drugs, had an interesting friendship with Wood and stared in two other movies, (Bride of the Monster, and the awful Glen or Glenda) and is the only bright spot in any of Woods films.
  Tim Burton made the movie ED WOOD in the 90's and it recieved wild success. Martin Landau would win an oscar for his role as Bella and the movies would bring people to see Wood's films. When watching ED WOOD you say to you'r self 'There is no way he was that bad' then you see the movie and understand he was.
  Ed Wood did have a real passion for the movie biz and a real zeal about his movies. however it also clouded his judgement to see that he could neither act, write, produce, or direct. Ed Wood is the worst ever but his movies are some of the funniest. It is ironic to think that the worst director of all time is responsible for a great actor winning the industry's highest award.",1016755200,,2237,4.124423963133641
595738,5,6303170498,"Bad films, or ""Z-Grade"" movies, are often disappointingly mediocre--there is often enough technical competence present to leave us with only a gory plot, rotten acting, and terrible writing; this only serves to raise (lower?) the viewing experience from cathartic laughter to disappointing banality. See Yuzna's ""The Dentist,"" L. Jackson's ""Christmas Evil,"" Trenchard-Smith's ""Leprechaun 4: In Space."" Actually, don't.
 But Plan 9 from Outer Space takes one's breath away. Vampire aliens try to invade our planet. Bela Lugosi plays an old man who dies and comes back from the dead. Unfortunately, Lugosi himself died and didn't come back. Wood's wife's chiropractor, who looks like Lugosi not at all, replaced him. To hide the fact that he was not, in fact, Bela Lugosi, he covered most of his face with a cape. And glared a lot. Criswell, who predicted we would all be gone by 1991, delivers the introduction, in which we learn this is a true story, ""based on actual reports."" Tor Johnson, who seems to be having a bad day, plays the ""heavy."" And I mean heavy. Believe it or not, John Breckinridge actually turns in a good performance as the aliens' leader (for which he deserves some sort of award); alas, it's lost amid a swarm of incompetence.
 I won't spoil the many enjoyable gaffes in this film, which are probably best enjoyed by film buffs. A couple of choice bits, however:
 * Although a heavy saucer-generated wind has blown over everyone on a patio, cigarette smoke of the heroine resolutely drifts upwards;
 * The round flying saucer has a square-shaped interior.
 * Certain scenes start in the morning, change into night, and immediately jump back into morning.
 * Tor Johnson does not seem to have memorized his lines.
 Wood's masterwork works on many levels, none of which Wood was aware of at the time. The interplay between time and space, between the general ""consistency"" and coherence which we expect in a film but are denied here, serve to create an absurdist dream which is both as comic and tragic as anything Beckett ever wrote. The nonsensical, farcical narrative hints at how we all, without success, try to make sense out of our lives. The patchwork structure of scenes show the interplay between everyone's life story, shot on different quality stock yet all connected. Finally, of course, the film acts as a brilliant satire of any alien movie ever made. I'll take Plan 9's scrambling, shambling scrappiness over Independence Day's cold, mechanized, greedy little blockbuster claws any day.
 Plan 9 from Outer Space is a dream-film in the same category as something by Lynch: ""Lost Highway"" with a sense of fun, a sprawling ""La Jetee,"" ""City of Lost Children"" grown up, and it's mined from the same vein of filmic ore as DeCillo's ""Living in Oblivion"" and Fellini's ""8 and 1/2."" Wood has earned his place alongside Welles, von Stroheim, and Dreyer as geniuses ahead of their time. Denied the right to their art and the public and critical support they deserved, they must wait in oblivion until the curtain of time is thrown back and we can witness their greatness... as such.
 With Tim Burton's luminous biopic putting the final sheen on Wood's reputation as the most tragically brilliant anti-auteur ever to hit Hollywood, it seems assured that, although no longer with us, the memory of Edward D. Wood will live on. (My friends and I still quote Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, fighting with a rubber octopus, to Wood, who made the mistake of asking for another take: ""...you! This water's COLD!""
 All that is left to do is to pull up some popcorn, grab a good friend and/or loved one, and a chair. And laugh.",1014595200,3,3640,4.8659127625201934

This flik is a screen talker's dream. Who else but Ed Wood could think up something so bad and get funding from a church!!
It is so bad that I love to watch it. Aliens creating zombies to conquer the earth with Bela Legosi thrown in, at least until he dies mid-way through the making.
I watch it often, sharpening my rapier wit on the dialogue and marveling that anyone could NOt like this movie.

595740,5,6303170498,"How wonderfully awful is this film?
For starters the title of this review is a quote from the film.
Plan 9 began in 1956 when Ed Wood (the alcoholic, angora sweater-wearing transvestite director--,convinced Bela Lugosi to shoot some scenes with him outside a home in the San Fernando Valley, and to mimic visiting his dead wife at a cemetery. He had been an avid fan of the aging former horror star and previously convinced him to appear in two previous films.  Bela was a narrator in Glen or  Glenda and  a low rent mad scientist in ""Bride of the Monster"". This time, Ed was going to bring back Bela to films as we all wanted to see him... as a vampire!!!!
Ed and Bela shot the footage in two days. It was silent. Shortly thereafter, Lugosi died.
Now most people would not continue to raise funds for a film starring Bela Lugosi, when the star had passed away after filming only a couple of scenes and no dialogue--- but then most people aren't Ed Wood. He scraped enough money together over the next couple of years to begin filming his epic masterpiece.
Ed let a chiropractor, who invested some money in the film, double, for his departed star. The much younger and much taller chiropractor would simply hide his face in a black cape, and slick back his hair and no one would be the wiser.
Criswell (A columnist psychic who has 1950's tv show) was convinced by Ed to be the film's on camera narrator.
I suppose not many people were asking Vampira - a popular TV horror movie host to be in a movie, so she agreed. He asked Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson to be in yet another one of his films. Tor, who spoke very little English, must have said yes.
A name cast!
Now add Bunny Breckinridge as the slightly effeminate pompous alien Eros, and Joana Lee (who became a successful writer for television) as his female alien side-kick, Gregory Walcott and Mona McKinnon would play the couple who live near the cardboard cemetery. Duke Moore, Paul Marco , Dudly Manlove, Conrad Brooks and others were hired to round out the stellar cast.  Some wisely knew to ask for cash at the end of each day of work.  They got paid.
There are a couple of truly effective shots in the film like one which has Vampira dn Tor Johnson moving through a fog enshrouded set past a creepy branch of a tree. Was it just an accident that Ed Wood got something right in this film?
Although this film was officially declared as the Worst Film of All Time and Golden Turkey by the book writing Medved brothers many years ago...there are dozens of films that are many movies that give it a run for that title. Worse enjoyable movies would  include: Mesa of Lost Women (Ron Ormond's film which contains a flashback within a flashback emanating from a character who could not have flash backed to the scene in the first place because he wasn't there! Ron Ormond incidentally allowed Ed Wood to use the headache inducing semi' flamenco guitar soundtrack he created for Mesa in several Ed Wood films !!!); or Robot Monster(Phil Tucker's part 3D film which features an alien--a Man with  panty hose on his face wearing a Gorilla Suit with a Deep Sea Diving Helmet over his head-- who is trying to eliminate the last few remaining earthlings with his calcinator death ray --a bubble machine probably picked up cheap from a Lawrence Welk Show garage sale-- from his hide out in Griffith Park's Bronson Cave); or Rat Pfink a Boo Boo(Ray Dennis Steckler's film who's title was created by a mistake which no  one had the money to fix is one of the prolific bad filmmaker's  most existential works--a movie Godard wished his name was on--perhaps--).
Ed Wood wrote and directed just two more conventional films after Plan 9:  The Plan 9 sequel called, Night of the Ghouls which wasn't publicly seen until the 1980's (Ed couldn't pay the lab bill and then the film was thought to be lost).He then wrote and directed an exploitation film about a group of sleazy called The Sinister Urge (released in 1960).
Then Wood became a frustrated alcoholic, bitter and disillusioned about his lack of success.  He wrote or worked as an assistant director on several soft-core sexploitation films. The most famous and widely available of these is Orgy of the Dead(which also features Criswell prominently. The film consists of women in various monster and ghoul costumes stripping for Criswell in a bad cemetery set. Ed divorced, lost his house in the Valley and moved into a run-down section of Hollywood (Yucca St (between Hollywood and Franklin). For about twenty years he paid his rent and liquor bills (mostly) by writing lots of pornographic books and making soft-core sexploitation films. Sometimes he played drooling older voyeur/dirty old men characters.  By the early 1970's he was direction hard core porno loops for Swedish Erotica and others.  Shortly before his death his ex-wife tried to help Ed who was ill and a terrible alcoholic. He was barely aware there was a cult following for his films when he died in the mid-70's. It was shortly after his death he was re-discovered by cult film buffs.
Several DVD versions of the film exist.  The best one is put out by IMAGE. It's got a fairly decent print of the film and includes Saucers Over the Hollywood the feature length 111 minute video documentary about the making of the film that's a must have for
all Ed Wood fans and includes visiting the tiny studio where much of the film was shot in 1958 in about 1986 with some of the original cast members.  ...",1012521600,24,5463,4.6233230134158925
595741,3,6303170498,"As bad as it is, Ed Wood's magnum opus has stretches of mere mediocrity.  A conversation in the Pentagon between a U.S. general and his colonel even demonstrates some degree of cinematic competency in the shot/counter shot editing of the dialogue exchange.  The problem is that the two actors have nothing to say that isn't redundant or superfluous to the story.  In other words, Wood constantly buys time by throwing in all sorts of filler material, atrociously written narration and dialogue, and repeated information (voice-over narration announces an action, we see the action, the voice-over narration tells us we've see the action).  Indeed, it's hard to explain the devotion of a director such as Tim Burton to a director who is so stage-bound, so theatrical, so content to shoot an unedited scene with 5 talking heads.  The fun begins whenever Wood attempts a cut--a perfunctory film device that in Woods' hands is an event commensurate to excuting a risky diving maneuver from the high platform.  The sight relays never quite match, the timing is always slightly off, the lighting and grain of the second shot is inconsistent with the second.
For the film student, these more subtle foibles are potentially instructive--a manual of what to avoid when making a film.  For the average viewer, they can be tedious and boring.  The more casual viewer is apt to be more entertained by the improbable set designs, the amateur acting which is frequently justaposed with an overly slick narrator or a Lawrence Olivier-sounding alien, the contrast between the 17-inch waist of Vampira and the 27"" neck of Tor Johnson, the confusing  gaps in a narrative so full of static and redundant material and, last but not least, the audacity or arrogance that allowed Wood to assume the untimely death of Bela Lugosi could be readily compensated for by having a substitute actor walk cluelessly through the film with his face hidden behind a cape.
The film is mercifully short (though it may not seem so).  And one thing Wood does get right is the sound.  Whereas many of today's most competently directed films contain numerous spoken lines that are mumbled, poorly miked and unintelligible, Wood seems to take extra pains to insure we hear each and every word of his original script.  In this single instance, unfortunately, Woods' reknowned incompetence does not rise to the occasion.",1011052800,2,2377,5.00507614213198

But it is ineptly, incompetently made, and as such is often unintentionally hilarious. The story, such as it is, concerns aliens who travel by hubcaps from outer space and who are so annoyed by earth's failure to RSVP that they attack via ""Plan 9."" This involves reanimating the recently dead and sending them out to terrorize people who live close to graveyards.  In the meantime, mainly to annoy the military, they hover their hubcaps over such strategic cities as Washington and Hollywood; when this gets old, they decide to kidnap a few earth people and talk them to death.
The script is Ed Woods at his Ed Woodsiest (""future events such as these will affect you in the future."")  The cast takes itself very seriously, and every one works very hard to perform as ineptly as possible. Among the notables: Paula Trent, whose voice reminds me of a jackass in heat; Tor Johnson, who is so wide he can't get out of his own grave (although presumably they got him in without any problem); and Bela Lugosi, who seems very vague about what's going on--but hey, he was already dead when filming began, so you can't blame him for it.  The art direction and special effects are particularly inspired.  After all, not every one would think of putting a shower curtain in an aircraft cockpit!
Now, how much you like PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE will depend on how much you enjoy its unintentional hilarity.  Like a fine wine, it is best when shared with friends so every one can point out the countless flaws.

The continuous changing from day to night in multiple scenes shows our fragile existance and how short life really is. Ed was trying to say ""You don't have to be just a day person or a night person. Life is precious and you should live it to the fullest."" He proved this point by hiring Bela to be in the movie despite his poor health. Yes he was replaced halfway through the movie after his death, but Ed was saying ""No one is indespensible. If you die you are replaced."" This is a beautiful message, espescially to those who's ego or head is just too big.
Vampira, beautiful and sureal, cannot be denied star billing in this flick. She has not one line. Ed was saying 'Women be silent!"". Not that he was a cheuvanist, but he liked to wear women's clothes (true story!). SO if he ever got caught wearing one of his female friend's clothing, he'd want her to keep quiet and not tell anyone.

595776,1,6303170498,"When I popped in Plan 9, I was watching it only because I had a relative in the movie. It was so bad I turned it off about 2/3 of the way through the movie, and for the 20 minutes before that I just quit paying attention.
The plot should warn anyone off the movie: Aliens have attempted 8 times to turn the people of earth into Zombies and they failed. Not wanting to give up, the attempt plan 9. It makes me think they must be part cat or something, 9 plans, 9 lives, what's the difference?
At this point the entire movie is hazy, I know the flying saucers are pie tins and scenes switch from day to night with no real reasoning, but the rest is pretty far gone. A lot of people will say that's what's makes is such a great movie, but I don't think it could warrant 5 stars no matter how you hacked it.

He might have been Ed Wood's wife/girlfriend's chiropractor, no one's ever told me which one. Either way he was a poor stand in for Lugosi.

Arguing about whether or not this is the all time worst movie is a bit pointless, no one will ever agree on it. It's kinda like picking the best movie ever or ordering pizza, to each their own. All I know is that this movie is the most amateurish, pretentious, FUNNY thing I have seen in a long long time.
The ""plot"" involves three ghouls in a cardboard graveyard. They have been reanimated by a group of aliens to take over the world. But no one is supposed to see them. But they're going to march on the capital. All three of them. The movie doesn't get any better from here.
Inspector Daniel Clay (you guessed it, Ed Wood's Swedish wrestler) is one of the ghouls, he is joined by Vampira and BelaLegosi/Ed Wood's wife's chiropractor. It's up to our intrepid heroes to stop the pyjama clad aliens from doing whatever it is they think they are doing.
Armed only with their brains (snicker) our intrepid group enters the alien ship. (why this is square when the enter and round when the get inside must be a scret of alien technology) There they meet a dimunative alien bossy-boots who goes on to deliver the most howlingly funny dialogue in a whole film of classic howlers.
I am of course referring to the STUPID STUPID STUPID conversation.
But this film offers other joys:
""Inspector Clay is dead, murdered, and SOMEBODY is responsible"" (the cop then goes on to scratch his neck with the barrel of his revolver, with his finger in the trigger!)
""I am emptied a full clip into him"" (This line would have been fine if it weren't for the fact that our hero was using a revolver)
The famous pillow dialogue during which a wife tells her husband that when he is gone, she touches his pillow and that way she isn't so lonely. (o-KAY!) Then she refuses to lock her door knowing there are ghouls in the area. Hey, no one said these people were smart

Granted, Ed Wood movies are sort of an acquired taste, and Plan 9 is *the* definitive Ed Wood film.  It's not as disjointedly surreal as 'Glen or Glenda' or as weirdly bleak as 'The Sinister Urge'; it's in many ways his masterpiece.  All the elements are in place: deranged dialogue, shots that can't decide if they're day or night, police cars that change make and model, and of course Bela Lugosi -- posthumously.
And you know what?  Plan 9 is actually a likeable movie, affably goofy and entirely unpretentious.  Frankly, it's better than some of the dreck pushed on us by mainstream Hollywood ... c'mon, what sounds more fun: watching Plan 9, or Dude, Where's My Car?

- The Swedish accent of wrestler Tor Johnson, playing a police officer / walking corpse.

If you were ever looking for a really bad movie, badly made, badly acted, horrible special effects crudely intermixed with stock footage, wretched, cheap sets, 'Plan 9' is it! This is the lowest of the low as far as '50's B-Movies went.
But there are actually many 'pluses' to 'PLAN 9'. 'PLAN 9' is quite notable as it is the last screen role that the late-great Bela Lugosi (""Dracula"") was featured in. Wood's direction and screenwriting are very humorous considering this was the period of U.S. History when nuclear war, space, and the future dominated the pop culture scene, so much of the dialogue is quite laughable today.
Furthermore, Tim Burton successfully resurrected the uncanny story and characters of Wood and his hodge-podge ensemble of Hollywood misfits and transvestites in 1993's ""Ed Wood"" with Johnny Depp and Martin Landau.
""Plan 9"" should be sitting on every movie buff's shelf (it is mine!). It stands as a tribute to all those terrible '50's B-Movies, and our American obsession for the slightly quirky '50's pop-culture. Get ""Plan 9"", and see it for yourself, if you dare!",999475200,6,1224,4.917874396135265

And in Plan 9 From Outer Space, we get to see Ed's ability to create the worst movies that can possibly be made.  Everyone has their favorite parts about the ineptitude of this movie.  My particular favorite is Ed's inability to want to re-shoot scenes thus resulting on final film as the actors bumping into sets, and stumbling around.  Another favorite is the fact of putting Bela Lugosi's name on the credits where all we see of him is a matter of moments in the beginning--and then a caped hidden mad that is supposed to be Bela (which was Ed's wifes chiropracter; who had no acting skill beforehand and was just chosen at random.

Sorry Ed, but we cant help but laugh at your attempt.  Enjoy the worst movie of all time that turned out to be an extreme mockery of the movie industry.",999388800,,1253,4.32051282051282

Ed Wood just needed a star to attract the crowd and since he had some strange footage lying around, he created the beginning of this movie from this footage. That is why the beginning is so funny !! We see a picture of Bela Lugosi walking around in a black dracula-like cloak, picking a flower, walking out of the picture and then we here the sound of an accident. For the rest of this film his character is played by the producer's wife's chiropractor.

595829,4,6303170498,"This may actually be ""the worst movie ever made.""  One critic counted 73 cinematic errors in it, from jump cuts to flubbed lines.  Another counted 82!  The story itself is not what makes it so bad.  There were a lot of sci-fi/horror B-movies made in the `50s with stories as bad as this one.  But they were made largely by professionals, and looked it onscreen.  It's the utter ineptness by almost everyone connected with PLAN 9 that makes it stand out at the bottom of the heap.  Still, Edward D. Wood, Jr. can be considered a successful filmmaker if only because he did make the movies he wanted to make, despite all the odds against him.  It's just too bad that his recognition came so long after his passing.
PLAN 9 is available from two different studios on DVD, Image Entertainment and Passport Video.  I have both, and the best version is the one from Image.  The picture quality is very good and the disc features the documentary ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood"" which is very interesting and amusing.  There's a lengthy chapter index and the theatrical trailer also.
The Passport Video disc has less good picture quality--the image is sharp but there's a slight flickering effect and a logo present all through the film in the bottom corner, PIP, which reminds me of the cable TV channel logos so prevalent and obnoxious today--and short interviews with six people (Johnny Depp, Martin Landau, Johnny Legend, Bela Lugosi, Jr., Maila Nurmi (Vampira), and Dolores Fuller) connected not only to PLAN 9, but also the movie ED WOOD.  Of these, the most interesting one is with actress Dolores Fuller, who is somewhat catty (justifiably so) about the actress, Sarah Jessica Parker, who portrayed her in ED WOOD.  There's a short chapter index and some trailers of other Ed Wood movies, and the theatrical trailer of PLAN 9, and that's it for bonus features.  Not bad for the money, though.
True PLAN 9 fans will probably want both versions, but if you only want one, I recommend the Image Entertainment edition.  You get more for the money.  And remember, as Criswell said, ""Future events will affect you in the future!""  How could they not?",985910400,8,2143,4.748648648648649

This movie was beyond bad.  There were only bits and pieces that remotely appeared to be professional.  The acting, story, scenery, special effects, and costumes were terrible.  The dialogue was even worse.  The lighting was even worse than that.  Surprise, surprise, the makeup was good.  No other redeeming qualities in this thing except that it's SO bad, you feel sorry for the director and for some of the actors if these were the best roles they could get.

But it is worth seeing. I love the bad actors and the vampire girl, played by Vampira (aka Maila Nurmi). And all the plot holes. But what really makes it so bad, is that it really is serious. I think Ed Wood really had a message he wanted to tell with the movie. I think he wanted to tell us to be careful and not push science to a level where we create things we can't handle and that can be dangerous to us.

""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" must be seen to be believed; it can best be described as a combination of utter incompetence and swaggering assurance. Everything you have heard about it is true: the wobbling tombstones, the spray-painted paper plates masquerading as spaceships, the scenes that can't even match day and night, the tall blond stand-in for Bela Lugosi, the stiff and pompous performances, the ridiculously tin-eared dialogue (""We have tried to contact the Earthlings. They refuse our existence!""). Only a director with an unshakable belief in his own star could could put such complete, festering dreck on the screen with such a straight face--which makes ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" one of the great laff riots of all time. One writer once described Ed Wood as having all the attributes of genius except talent; in all the annals of art, I can think of only one other figure that resembles him--the Scottish poet William McGonagall, another guaranteed laff riot. I hope that, somewhere in a particularly goofy corner of Heaven, Ed Wood is shooting a William McGonagall script. The angels must be busting a gut!",979430400,2,1167,5.020618556701031
595895,5,6303170498,"Plan 9 is just as bad as everyone says it is (buy it buy it buy it!), so this review is just a reminder for you to purchase the better of the two DVDs that Amazon offers of this title.
Do NOT buy the Passport Video edition...it has horrible sound and the picture lighting throbs between dark and bright through the entire film.  Passport Video also included a watermark of their logo in the bottom right hand corner of the screen that lasts throughout the film.  In addition to all of this, what is advertised on the package as ""Show 2: THE ED WOOD STORY"" is in fact 40 mins. of cobbled together interviews with Vampira, Johnny Depp, Ed Wood's wife, and one of Tor Johnson's neighbors.  Sounds okay, but they are actually mind-bogglingly uninsightful and focus mostly upon Tim Burton's Ed Wood film.
The edition of this DVD that you will want to buy is the Image Entertainment version that includes the 111 min. documentary ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood"" (which is a wonderful addition).  This DVD has great sound and picture quality, vastly superior to Passport Video's piddly excuse for a quality DVD.
I know that it may seem counter productive to buy a more expensive release of the worst movie of all time, but you will appreciate the horrible experience of grave robbers from outerspace much more (and Image Entertaiment's documentary is great too).",979430400,100,1355,4.728813559322034

595897,4,6303170498,"There are two kinds of bad movies - the kind through which you cannot sit and the kind that raise their ""badness"" to an art form.  Plan 9 is in the latter category.  Originally titled Graverobbers from Outer Space, it tells the story of the Leader of the Galaxy (named Eros = Greek god of love) and how he tries to take over the Earth using human zombies.  Various people catch onto the plan and try to stop the surprisingly humanoid aliens.
None of this is important, though.  What is fun in the inane dialogue, some examples of which are, ""We are all interested in the future for that is where you and I will spend the rest of our lives."", ""You see?  Your stupid minds!"", and ""Inspector Clay is dead! Murdered! And someone's responsible!"".  In addition, supposedly contiguous scenes are filmed half in the daytime, half at night; you can see strings on the flying saucers (descibed as ""cigar shaped"" in the dialogue); styrofoam gravestones wobble; etc.  The star of the film, Bela Lugosi, passed away before the movie started production - most of his part is played by another actor with a cape over his face.
Thus, there is enough here to keep anyone amused, if not laughing out loud, through most of the film.  It is highly recommended.
The rest of my comments will centre on the DVD edition.  The video is remarkably clear and crisp.  The audio track does not fare as well, but it's okay.  There are some extras, including some trailers for both this film and other Wood offerings - very entertaining.  Finally, there are some interviews.  Unfortunately, some are inane, dealing solely with the Tim Burton Movie ""Ed Wood"", which, while interesting, are not really appropriate here.  The more personal interviews are better - one of Wood's actresses and ex-girlfriends, a neighbour of Tor Johnson's, and Lugosi's son.  An okay set of extras for a movie that's 40 years old.  But why, OH WHY??, did the company that produced the movie insist on putting its semitransparent logo in the corner (like the little TV network logos) through the entire movie?  Argh!!  This feature alone robs the movie of its fifth star.",975369600,21,2117,4.706521739130435
595898,4,6303170498,"Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is a legendary film, not because it is great cinema but because watching it is an unforgettable experience.  In that respect it is more comparable to a midnight showing of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" than anything else.  I am perfectly comfortable with the oxymoronic notion that the film is so gloriously bad that it becomes transcendent in a way ""Reefer Madness"" and other notable ""bad"" films are not.  I have shown ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" to many an unsuspecting audience and all of them have enjoyed the experience.  There is such an audacity to Wood's film that you have to smile if just to keep your jaw from dropping all the way to the ground.  The only other explanation is, as the head alien says in the film, ""Because you earth people are all idiots!""  I am comfortable with either one of these explanations.
Just count all the things Ed Wood gets wrong in this film.  After eight disastrous attempts to take over the planet, the aliens invoke ""Plan 9"" wherein they raise the dead as foot soldiers.  Vampira and wrestler Tor Johnson become zombies.  You have a flying saucer that look a lot like a Cadillac hubcap held up by string.  You have a star, Bela Lugosi, who died before filming started but who appears from beyond the grave, not to mention his stand-in, the chiropractor of the producer's wife.  You have cops who scratch their noses with loaded guns, Dudley Manlove as the unforgettable leader of the aliens, sets that are about to tip over, plus a chilling introduction and postscript from the Amazing Criswell!
Is this the worst film of all time?  What difference does it make?  Do you really want to keep looking after you have experienced the two-time Golden Turkey Award-winning ""Plan 9 From Outer Space?""  You owe it to yourself to watch this movie at least once.

To earn this lofty and envious distinction, you have to remember  that there was an abundance of really bad science fiction/horror movies  released in the 50's.  PLAN 9 has been so bad for so long, it's developed a  cult following.  People LOVE to see it.  It's so bad, it's good...if that  makes sense...
The plot (if you can call it that) is about a group of  aliens seeking to destroy mankind before mankind fouls up the universe.  The acting is really funny!  (I think third graders would have a better  chance of pulling off RICHARD III.)  The sets, effects....all awful!  Production values?  There are none!  Lugosi died before the film was even  halfway completed.  He only appears in the first few scenes.  Rather than  reshoot, a replacement was put in:  Lugosi's chiropractor, who was at least  a head taller than Lugosi.  Also any scene with Tor Johnson is a real hoot!
Don't get me wrong:  You should see this movie for laughs --- you'll  find plenty!  The film will be around for a long time to show us just how  bad a film can be.

595944,5,6303170498,"Movies, like any artistic medium, are easily dividedintogenres. There are comedies, tragedies, action films, romances, and countless others. In each genre lies masterpieces, the films that define their category and stand atop the heap. For romance, one must surely consider Gone with the Wind, An Affair to Remember, and the like. Action films? Anything by Jackie Chan, or the many Schwarzenegger adventures. Yes, there are some films that typify and glorify their genre.
And then, of course, there are others.  Some films represent the absolute worst of their genre; action movies are dragged through the mud by Billy Blanks and Dolph Lundgren, while lovers of comedy flinch at the mention of Carrot Top's direct-to-video excursions.  There are certainly bad movies. In fact, bad is the subject of this website. But when talking about bad, and about movies, one name must always be mentioned. You see, in the history of moving pictures, there is one work that is so cosmically atrocious, it transcends genre, and has rightly taken its place at the very top of the very bottom.

Unfortunately, it fails in one area, which would be the exhibition of the movie itself, which, to coin a phrase, must be seen to be understood. It's truly impossible to convey a solid sense of this movie's shortcomings without actually seeing it, but I'll try. Now, remember at all times upon reading the rest of this review that Ed Wood, who produced, wrote and directed the movie, was at all times completely serious about everything, and honestly thought he was making a good movie.

Consistently failing to triumph  over the lack of money, resources and technique available, it quite neatly  shows how films should not be judged in terms of 'bad' or 'good', but in  terms of 'entertaining' or 'not entertaining'. Whilst 'Plan Nine' is  clearly the work of bungling, but enthusiastic incompetents, it's hugely  entertaining in a way that the professionally-done 'Speed 2: Cruise  Control' is not. Only 'Robot Monster' comes close the the tone of insane  incoherence. Where else can you see such a diverse, iconic cast (featuring  the recently-deceased Bela Lugosi, a late-night-television horror movie  hostess, a wrestler, and a minor celebrity hypnotist) deliver dialogue such  as 'Inspector Clay's dead, murdered, and somebody's responsible'?

The first is  PASSPORT which, from all the other reviews seem to say, should be avoided.  Apparently the company has their logo visible on screen the ENTIRE movie  and featurette which follows.  And they also don't even include a chapter  index. The other company which distributes this movie is IMAGE  ENTERTAINMENT.  This is the version I have and THIS is the DVD to get of  ""Plan 9"".

595991,5,6303170498,"Is this the Worst Film of All Time?
That's what you really want to know, is it? The answer is....it depends. If by ""bad"", you mean ludicrous special effects, non-existent continuity, wooden acting, and  jaw-dropping dialogue (""Modern women. They've been that way down  through the ages---especially in a mess like this!"") then ""Plan  9"" certainly deserves the title of ""Worst Film"" more than  any other movie made in the last century.
If however, you mean a movie so  boring, nauseating, or repellant that it becomes unwatchable, then  ""Plan 9"" is not a bad film at all. (""Natural Born  Killers"" and ""Caligula"" better fit this category than Wood's  gentle, albeit bizarre, films.) When it comes to sheer entertainment,  ""Plan 9"" more than delivers if you're the type of person who  likes to laugh at bad movies. There's always something on the screen that's  at least amusing, and more often than not, hilarious. If watching airline  pilots radioing the control tower with an ordinary telephone doesn't have  you in stitches, Bela Lugosi's screen double (who doesn't look like him)  will. There are many other films that are technically better made that I  easily forget and don't want to see again. I never grow tired of watching  this film, and it's always good for a hearty laugh.
That's why I'm rating  ""Plan 9"" 5 stars...because of the movie itself, not the  weaknesses of the DVD release. This is the first DVD I've ever bought that  didn't bother to print a chapter directory for the inside cover. And was it  really necessary to display the logo in the lower right hand corner  throughout the film? You can't make decent copies of DVDs, so it's  unnecessary! Still, I liked the interview clips that they included, but if  you want to learn more about Ed Wood's life, you might want to see a film  like ""Look Back In Angora"" or read ""The Nightmare of  Ecstacy."" I don't believe these disappointments are enough to not buy  the DVD if you like the film, but if you think they are, don't hesitate to  get the VHS tape.
One last thing I'll comment on. It's a damn shame that  Ed Wood didn't live to see the publication of ""The Golden  Turkeys"" book by Michael Medved which proclaimed Wood the worst  director of all time. Wood wouldn't have shrunk away in embarrassment, but  would have been proud to baske in the spotlight for this dubious  achievement, especially since many fans of his have since crawled out of  the woodwork. But I'd like to think somewhere in heaven, Ed Wood is smiling  because he's finally achieved cinema immortality...",958262400,11,2548,4.755148741418764
595992,4,6303170498,"No, ""Plan 9"" isn't the *worst* movie ever made; if it was, why would anyone want to SEE it, much less buy it? (Try on ""Red Zone Cuba"" and tell me it's better than this!) The charm of ""Plan  9"" is it's goofy, cheerful incompetence. Nowhere else will you see  sheriffs (and their deputies) scratching their heads with their pistol  barrels, or flying saucers that wobble so violently that their occupants  must be jellied, or hear such inept dialogue (""There's one thing for  certain, and that's that someone murdered the sheriff, and someone is  responsible"". And that's one of the *better* lines...)
But the real  reason to see this DVD is the ""Flying Saucers Over Hollywood"" - a  gem in it's own right! The producers could EASILY have released this all on  its own.

Disappointing to me.  Also in the disappointing department is  packaging which has no inside printed information whatsoever--it's a  generic case inside; also, as mentioned by others, the logo on screen  throughout is a small nuisance (apparently Passport wanted to discourage  others from copying this film for other uses); and, the picture  quality--while not terrible--is certainly dark in places:  I cannot see  that you gain much in picture quality over the VHS versions at half the  price.

However, if a movie is as entertaining as this one -even if it's not in the  way its creators intended- it can't be that bad.  I've watched this movie  countless times and I never fail to laugh at the absurdity of it all.  Nowadays, no one could intentionally create a comedy to be as entertaining  in the way ""Plan 9"" is.  It's a great party film if you have quick witted  friends.  If you really want a BAD film, watch ""Wild Wild West.""  ""Plan 9""  may have UFO's made out of pie pans; but at least it doesn't have a stupid  80ft spider.  There's a difference between entertainingly bad and just  plain bad.  ""Plan 9"" is the former.

596040,3,6303170498,"A funny thing about this film is the way people who have seen it often mention the imbecilic dialogue. One of my favourite bits is when a man makes a comment to his friend about modern women. ""Yeah"", the  friend agrees, ""They've been like that all through the  ages.""
If you're looking for the terror and special effects of  ""War of the Worlds"" you won't find it here. This horror film will  make you cringe and laugh. A race of aliens, angry that we've ignored their  messages, have come to Earth to make us pay for our insolence. They use  Plan 9 to bring three corpses back to life, presumably as an advance  invasion party.
The scariest thing about this film is that Ed Wood might  have been right about alien intelligence. What if it turns out that aliens  really are a race of preachy twits who look like us? All that money that  other directors spent on special effects would have been wasted!
When the  leading man first saw the script for this film he thought that a seven  year-old child could have written better dialogue. Vampira was so  embarassed by it she wouldn't say any lines. Bela Lugosi was dead so he  couldn't say any lines. The more times you see this film the more mistakes  you notice. There's too many to mention here, but they glare right at  you.

""The  world,"" as it turns out, is a graveyard with a bunch of styrofoam  tombstones.  The aliens are on ""Plan 9"" (the other eight failed),  which involves raising the dead (among them the talent-challenged Tor  Johnson and remarkably top-heavy ""Vampira"").  They do this by...  well, it's never quite explained, except that the aliens have  ""knowledge of... such things.""

7840671,2,6303170498,"Aliens plan to take over the Earth by raising an army of the dead to subjugate the living. They amass a horde of three zombies (one played by Bela Lugosi, who died a few days into the shoot) to do their bidding--terrorizing a town just outside of Hollywood, California. The residents struggle to discover what's going on in their graveyard and in the skies overhead. Meanwhile, the U. S. military gets involved, hoping to quell the invasion before the general public finds out.

This movie is legendary as one of the worst films ever made (if not the worst). In addition to the problems of low budget effects, ridiculous dialogue, mismatched studio and location shots, and the death of Bela Lugosi (replaced with another actor hiding his face with his cape), the movie also struggles with its sense of profundity. It has a big message like The Day the Earth Stood Still (in fact, practically the same anti-nukes message) but the presentation is so obvious and so overblown that viewers shake with laughter rather than fear. Many of the speeches seem crafted to sound wise and deep but come off as ludicrous. For example, the very first speech is by the psychic Criswell, who says to the camera: ""Greetings, my friend. We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives. And remember my friend, future events such as these will affect you in the future."" The delivery is so earnest and so laughable all at the same time. The movie maintains a similar attempt at depth throughout. The movie tries hard to be great and fails at every attempt.

Why then is the movie still popular over fifty years later, when most other poorly conceived and executed films have been forgotten? There is a certain charm about the incompetent earnestness on display. Many science fiction cliches (flying saucers, ray guns, arrogant and superior aliens who we can beat more or less easily) are used in the most stereotypical manner possible. When an actor accidentally knocks over one of the cardboard tomb stones during a shot, that's left in rather than redone correctly or edited out somehow. The movie is much funnier (even though unintentionally) than many comedies.

I can't really recommend the movie on any artistic or moral level but it does have entertainment value. If you are curious about it, you should give it a watch. At 79 minutes, it comes and goes quickly. There are other longer, more serious, more arty films that I'll never watch again (I'm looking at you, The New World), but if someone wanted to watch this, I'd rewatch it with them. Maybe I should be ashamed of that, but that's me.",1506384000,,2639,4.707792207792208
