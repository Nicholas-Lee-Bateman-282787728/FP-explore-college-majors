8731082,5,B014KEPFVK,"Mutta nears the end of his astronaut training and is on top of the world! Meanwhile, Hibito is dealing with the repercussions of PTDS and is hitting pretty much the lowest point of his life.

This set contains some of my favorite episodes in the series. The contrast between Mutta's victory and Hibito's struggle makes for some very emotional content. The entire series Mutta has been jealous of Hibito, while Hibito himself has always had an upbeat attitude. But now he has hit a large snag in his life plans and it isn't so easy to deal with. Naturally he keeps this a secret from Mutta, who continues on being jealous of his little brother even as Hibito is losing everything.

This set contains episodes 65-75 (11 episodes) out 99 total.",1447200000,4,741,4.648854961832061
