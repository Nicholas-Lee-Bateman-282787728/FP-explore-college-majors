8706765,5,B00UGQQCIC,"The director's cut contains excellent additional material that makes the difference between a 4 star and a 5 star flick. The shorter version cut out some really good jokes, perhaps so as to not offend an overly sensitive audience...? Kudos to the cast, the writing, the direction and the production on such a limited budget. Extras include the filmmakers explaining the long road to getting this film produced. Get the director's cut if you can, it's worth it.",1508457600,,460,4.910256410256411
