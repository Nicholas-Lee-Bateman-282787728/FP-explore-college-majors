8738705,5,B017DF98IY,"They don't make westerns like this anymore, top line actors, great story; What made it, was the use of the actual location. No matter what part she had to play Katy Jurado always stood out. CM Warren showed how to direct. Great film/movie even after all this time",1526860800,,263,4.5

8738707,2,B017DF98IY,"They tried, but did not succeed. The acting was terrible. The special effects were cheesy. There were some serious holes in certain scenes. Certain things just didn't make any sense.",1470614400,,182,5.1
8738708,4,B017DF98IY,"The synopsis here is that Kye Cortland (Dan Mor) is escaped from a planetary prison by some guerrilla types who are the enemy of the Empire and sent on a mission on a ship called Arrowhead as he has the technical skills to fly it. The mission goes a tad wrong and he gets shipwrecked on a deserted moon.

There is a tradition that certain prisoners are executed on a particular day each year and Kye finds out his father is next.  All he wants to do is get to him before that happens and these outlaws are his only chance. The problem is he is not alone on this moon and what he meets will change him forever.

Now this is low budget but that made me like it even more. They have gone back to basics and used bits of old vacuum cleaners and typewriters to make some of the props  even dustbin lids are employed. The acting is all excellent. Dan Mor is particularly good, but I have to say hats off to Christopher Kirby who starred in the brilliant Iron Sky. He only has a small role but absolutely nails it and then some. The on board computer is brilliant too and will remind certain people of Dark Star or even Red Dwarf. The story itself is refreshingly original and it manages to keep the tension going right the way to the final frame. The CGI varies from rather good to above average but I am more than happy to live with that when the over all package is actually engagingly good.",1458604800,2,1387,4.203007518796992
8738709,4,B017DF98IY,"Arrowhead is the name of a spacecraft inspired by the Twilight Zone episode 'I Shot An Arrow Into the Air.'  Kye Cortland (Dan Mor) has gathered data from an Arrowhead for General Hatch (Mark Redpath) of the resistance/rebels/enemy/terrorists. Things go awry and Kye becomes stranded on a moon with Tarren Hollis (Aleisha Rose) a government biologist. The atmosphere is toxic and somehow Kye becomes immune to the effects through symbiosis, which has some other strange effects as we discover as the film progresses.

The ending of the film ties things together and makes the film palatable for hard core science fiction fans. Being filmed in  South Australia (Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome location) made it look like another world especially with a planet in the background looking a bit large. Special effects were decent, considering the budget,  as was the overall plot. However the film lacked characters to grab and hold my interest. Kye, by default was our protagonist. We knew little about him. He was a drab and boring character. The dialogue was bland as was the acting.

I liked the fact they used a 3D printer to make the masks. Sleep pods made out of compost bins, plastic gutters, and vacuum cleaner hoses. They were very resourceful. Good job. Next time they can create characters.

8738710,4,B017DF98IY,"Strange things happen on a strange moon. Arrowhead is at once completely generic and like nothing you've ever seen. It's a South Australian throwback to 1970s/80s science fiction (and maybe even 1994's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Earth-2/dp/B0009JE6G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Earth 2</a>, which itself is a throwback), but with slightly updated tech. Assuming you're a sci-fi fan, you've seen most of this before, just not in this combination.

The R2-D2 in Arrowhead is RE3F (pronounced ""reef""), and while ""he"" is designed to be a stationary form of AI (he's later repurposed to be mobile) he's at least able to speak English instead of relying on beeping sounds. RE3F is reminiscent of Hal from Stanley Kubrick's 2001, but with a less ominous and slightly more chipper attitude (a smidgen of Bounty Bear from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Until-the-End-of-the-World/dp/B00080SK3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Until the End of the World</a>&nbsp;is thrown in for good measure). Rather than babbling on incessantly, RE3F needs to be prompted before sharing information and he's a bit like the Windows OS in that when you're logged on as a guest, you don't have full access. Yes, I've babbled on about RE3F, but only because he's a central character who makes the film better (arguably, if you grow accustomed to his voice).

Kye Cortland (Dan Mor) is the protagonist, and he begins the story at a rugged outdoors penal colony. Just when I was potentially zoning out, Tarren Hollis (Aleisha Rose) appears; being a sucker for cute young women who wear astronaut helmets, I was reeled in for the duration. The cast appeared to be ravaged by Australian bush flies during several scenes in Arrowhead, to the extent you feel bad for the actors as you watch. Who knows, maybe the moon was supposed to have a bug problem...

Are there aliens? Why yes there are; akin to those Vin Diesel fought against in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pitch-Black/dp/B001RTCP1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pitch Black</a>, yet it's an oversimplification to say that's the enemy in Arrowhead.

Arrowhead becomes more bizarre the longer you watch, only to shift into reverse while driving 90 mph down the highway. The last 5 or so minutes are lame, sorry. If you're going to do a bunch of weird crap and tug at the audience's brainstrings, then why in any world would you end your flick with a Standardized Hollywood Happy Ending?

3.5 stars: Worth Watching if you like strangeness and accept low budget productions.",1454544000,4,2626,5.705882352941177
