195898,5,1575239701,"Well, after the pretty poor by Argento standards ""Trauma"" and the near-perfect ""Stendhal Syndrome"", Dario Argento pulls off his  most expensive in-joke yet! I saw this movie at Athens Film Festival where  they had organised a retrospective of Dario's work and I found it  extreamely interesting.
Argento does not care to make a horror film,  that's for sure. Instead, he creates a self-ironic film, deliberatly  balancing between shots of poetic grace (the Phantom's visions of children  pierced by mousetraps - chilling) and shots of extravagant kitch (Asia's  appearance in the same scene!).
Argento's choice of not to have his  Phantom disfigured was not without a point: This man is disfigured from the  inside, and thanks to the script, it shows. Let's not forget that Gerard  Brach, the co-scripter, is the man who co-wrote ""Frantic"",  ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and many other Polanski films. So,  there is no mistake here.
The film is deliberatly funny in places but it  contains some very weird scenes (like the one in the borthel - unbelievable  for an Argento film). I would say that it is his more Felini-esque film  yet. It is his ""8 1/2"". After all, he is Italian!
A movie that  belongs more to the Art-House section than to that of Horror, I might add.  Don't miss it though.  And buy the Ennio Moriconne soundtrack, it is a  masterpiece!",941414400,14,1357,4.898678414096916
195919,4,1575239701,"Let me just say that this is not a bad movie. I feel that people have too many expectations after seeing the musical. You must view this film as a loose interpretation of the novel so FORGET THE MUSICAL.

This ""Phantom"" film takes a turn from other versions...the most obvious being that this phantom (played incredibly by Julian Sands) is NOT deformed, in fact he looks somewhat decent. Christine (played by Asia Argento) is actually in a tough situation: She has her lover (Roul, who is somewhat of a d-bag), and a good looking phantom. In this one, she falls in love with the phantom, which is what a load of the viewers wanted and to be honest, this more of a GOTHIC LOVE STORY rather than a horror film. The phantom has many qualities of a vampire which makes him so much more mysterious!

This is a very acceptable movie, you just have to watch it with an open mind and FORGET THE MUSICAL BECAUSE THIS IS MEANT TO BE A HORROR FILM. If you want to really enjoy this version, watch it drunk like I have on a couple occasions.

PS, the chandelier crash in this ""Phantom"" is better than any other film version. Absolutely brilliant!",1352073600,3,1134,4.4423076923076925
195920,2,1575239701,"Dario Argento may be one of the greatest horror directors of all time, but his version of Phantom of the Opera is an ill-conceived, jaded, self-contradictory mess of a film.  I'll admit that my unbounded love for Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom of the Opera and the feature film starring Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum probably contributes to my harsh judgment of Argento's adaptation, but parts of this story don't even make sense.  I found Christine's downright schizophrenic emotional reactions to the Phantom and Raoul - especially in the film's closing moments - to be an even bigger issue than the fact that the Phantom was raised by telepathic rats.  Just think about this - abandoned as a baby, our Phantom was saved and then brought up by telepathic rats deep below the Paris Opera House.  That, of course, explains how he can communicate with Christine using only his mind, why he kills his victims with his bare teeth, and why he can be completely put off his game by the smell of cheese.  Actually, I made that last bit up, but I'm surprised it didn't find its way into this terribly disappointing script.

While this film changes elements of the story in ways that would make poor Gaston Leroux flip his lid, it does follow the basic outline of this often-told tale.  The Phantom (Julian Sands) loves the up-and-coming singer Christine Daae but finds himself on the short end of the triangle when pretty boy Raoul enters the picture.  This Phantom suffers no physical deformities, however (I guess the writers figured the mental scars of being raised by telepathic rats was quite enough on its own).  He looks a lot like Lucius Malfoy after a couple of weeks in Azkaban, so the only thing he has need of is a haircut, not a mask.  Dario's daughter Asia Argento plays Christine Daae in a way that was quite alien to me.  I don't blame Asia - given the right part, she can be an amazing actress.  The problem is with the character herself.  The innocence and virtue of this charming young lady has always been at the heart of the Phantom story, but there's nothing soft or charming about Argento's Christine.  She's rather a cold and conniving lass with a natural affinity to the dark side offered to her by the Phantom.  Cry and moan as she might later on, neither true love nor any sense of romance can penetrate her hard shell.  That means, of course, that this film denigrates the love story that The Phantom of the Opera has always carried at its heart.  For his part, Raoul isn't as big a putz as usual, but he is greatly tainted by a scene that takes place inside an opium den.  As for the rest, I'll be danged if I can name a single likeable character in the bunch.  There's even a sick old coot preying upon the young ballet students.  And, lest we forget, there is Ignace the rat-catcher, one of the filthiest characters to ever grace the screen; dumb as the dirt that sticks perpetually to his body and clothes, the guy somehow manages to invent a motorized vehicle long before Henry Ford ever muttered the words ""Model T.""  I'm afraid that was just too much for me.

One big difference between this and other versions of Phantom of the Opera is the fact that the Phantom actually gets some for once.  Unfortunately, he finds that Christine has a disturbing tendency to bounce back and forth between love and hate faster than the ball in a Chinese ping pong championship match rally.  Some of her reactions are as inexplicable to me as Argento's reason for shooting close-ups of Christine's vocal performances when Aria does such a terrible job of pretending to sing the words.

You would be hard pressed to find a Dario Argento fan who offers any strong praise for this movie, which is especially bad given the fact that this is a film only an Argento fan could love.  I don't think Phantom of the Opera fans will like this film at all, and there isn't really enough blood and gore to sway the minds of horror fans, either.  I also must warn any and all potential viewers that Argento springs a nude scene on you featuring a number of people I would never, ever have wanted to see without abundant layers of clothes covering every part of their bodies.",1312502400,,4172,4.57258064516129

195922,1,1575239701,"To warn those who haven't watched this adaptation:  it is a disgusting heap of filth that should be burned to a smoldering crisp and thrown deep into the ocean.  And when I say deep, I mean launch it into the trenches and make sure it penetrates the earth's crust.  Never to be seen again.  EVER.  Save yourself and go watch the 1990 version with Charles Dance or the 2004 Andrew Lloyd Webber version.  Or, you know, any other version.
And if you are just beginning to become a Phantom of the Opera fan, please, NEVER EVER WATCH THIS VERSION. It is nothing like the actual story, and NOT A GOOD ADAPTATION.  PLEASE DON'T RUIN YOUR BEGINNING VIEWS OF THE PHANTOM AND JUST WALK AWAY.

Also, this review contains spoilers, so if you are indeed going to sit through approximately and hour and thirty minutes of this abomination, then don't read.

To start with, the cover is incredibly misleading.  The ""Phantom"" doesn't wear a mask at all-- all he has are some rats and a really fake wig.  I mean, if you're going to make a adaptation of a horribly disfigured man, HAVE A HORRIBLY DISFIGURED MAN IN IT.

Anyway, onto the actual movie.  Dario Argento's so called ""Phantom of the Opera"" is rife with scenes that make no sense and bad acting.

Both love interests have unattractive and incredibly fake long hair and act incredibly possessive and creepy.
The ""Raoul"" in this, looking like an uglier version the artist formerly known as Prince, eventually goes to a bath house to smoke opium and slaps a whore around for ""not being Christine"", as another reviewer puts it.

The actress for Christine is always either having an extreme orgasm or she's terrified.  The only thing she can lipsinc properly is ""Ooh ee oo- oo~"" (which she still can't do right), and when she tries anything harder she looks like a gaping fish.  She also gets to wear transparant clothing, grope her own breasts, have the most anti-erotic sex with the Phantom, and then gets to be raped by the Phantom.  Now, this would only slightly bother me under normal circumstances.  However, this horribly mortifies me because of the fact that THE ACTRESS THAT PLAYS CHRISTINE IS THE DIRECTOR'S DAUGHTER.  It's even more disgusting to think that her father is instructing her on what to do while she's acting the ""erotic"" parts of the movie.

Then, we come to the ""Phantom"", who has suffered the worst character assassination.  In this version, he has telephathic powers and was raised by rats instead of having a deformed face and being an overall genius.  How the hell does he get telepathic powers?  From the telepathis/telekinetic rats?  (Oh, yeah, they have super powers, too.)  He stalks Christine, violates Carlotta by gropping and scratching her breast, kills some unimportant characters and a pedophile, possibly eats a person, gets a rock thrown at him by the bipolar Christine, and then is shot and stabbed about seven times before falling to his death in the lagoon.  And those aren't even the worst parts.  He thinks about naked men being trapped in a large rat-trap and Christine only covered in what may possibly be either seaweed or another one of the ""Phantom's"" bad wigs.  One watching loses all sympathy for the ""Phantom"" as he rapes Christine and then goes on to stuff a rat down his pants as he masturbates.  And yes.  I am not making that up.  He actually does that.  This ""Phantom"" lacks the finesse, grace, genius and deformities of both physical and mental status that we ""phans"" have all come to know and love.  He is a disgrace to all Phantom adaptations and I refuse to even consider him a true adaptation of Erik the Opera Ghost.

The only- and I mean ONLY- redeeming quality of this movie is the maid, who only gets a short amount of screentime.  She makes dry, sarcastic remarks, insults everyone, and beats up Josef Buquet.  She is, in other words, ""bad ass"".  They should have just made the movie about her beating up and insulting everyone.

So, to reiterate my first point, DON'T WATCH THIS HORRIFIC PILE OF TRIPE.  IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME, NOR YOUR MONEY.",1293062400,,4052,4.68413597733711
195923,1,1575239701,"I'm a big Julian Sands fan.  I'm a big Phantom of the opera fan.  I can put up with a lot of bad aspects in a movie and still enjoy it.  Finally, I am not afraid to watch movies that are taboo and frightening on a moral ground. That being said, I would not recommend this movie to anyone except as a a movie to make fun of.

The acting is decent...for 5 second spurts, in 2 sections of the movie.  The rest is god-awful.

The settings for the movie, meaning the opera house and caves and what not, were an excellent choice and might be the only redeeming factor to this movie.

The plot/story is messy, unorganized, too unfocused, and too ""out there"" even for me.  It's filled with inconsistencies and lots of moments where a character will say or do something that will in turn make you ask, ""wait, what is it they're trying to achieve?""

All in all, it's a very disappointing movie.  If you have a collection of movies that are so bad their only purpose is to amuse you with how bad they are, this is the movie for that collection.

195925,3,1575239701,"Italian horror maestro Dario Argento took this classic story and went a bizarre direction with it.  I'm all for a nice dosage of gore and dark comedy, but here it does seem a little misplaced.  There are a few hilarious moments of subtle opera satire, accompanied by some seriously goofy mishaps.  However, with some great kill scenes and the director's familiar POV camera angles, this adaption is somewhat worthwhile for the Argento fan.  Others might consider this a bastardization of the novel, but there is no denying the uniqueness.

The most glaring difference here is the Phantom is not disfigured.  Not in the least.  He does look a little strange, but hey, he was raised by rats.  This decision was a bit puzzling to me, but I suppose Dario wanted to show this tormented soul was ugly and demented on the inside.  This Phantom seems to be disgusted with human life and ready to kill anyone that wanders into his lair, much like a person killing a rat.  A little rat revenge, so to speak.

Christine is played nicely by Asia Argento, and her singing is stunning and beautiful.  Made me wonder if that was actually her voice.

The story progresses with the expected but strange love triangle.  This Phantom has telepathic abilities, which seems kinda hokey.  But super crazy soon starts to kick in, and you'll no doubt be shocked.  Some of the highlights include midget decapitation, a Turkish bathhouse orgy, and a rat masturbation scene?  Yeah, don't ask.  Definitely not your typical Argento film.

All in all, this is a very unusual offering from the masterful director.  Not his best by any means, but possibly worth a look if you're craving something different.",1273449600,,1675,4.810526315789474

The opera scenes are beautiful, the music is good if not standard, but the story sucks. The Phantom is raised by rats and his face is not scarred at all. The one problem I had was during the kills the screen just turns black and all you hear is screams and thuds. I have no idea why they would do that but oh well.

Dario Argento's Phantom of the Opera is not the best version of the film by far. If your a hardcore fan of the story, movies, or Broadway plays then you may want to stay away. If you know nothing of the story and just want something to watch then i'd check it out.",1253491200,,893,4.045197740112994

195930,3,1575239701,"Good gawd almighty!  That was my first reaction once I'd finished watching Italian horror maestro, Dario Argento's version of the oft-filmed ""Phantom of the Opera"".  I think it's safe to say that there's never been another ""Phantom"" quite like it.  It starts out as a sort of twisted variation on the Tarzan legend, with an abandoned baby in a foreign environment being rescued and raised by the resident wildlife.  As most people know, with Tarzan it was apes who did the child-rearing.  But it may come as something of a surprise to learn that with the Opera Phantom, it's, er, um, rats doing the parenting.  At least according to Argento.  Which begs any number of questions, none the least of which are: how did the rats nourish and feed the baby, change his diapers, bathe him, teach him to speak English, and play the piano, for crying out loud?  Of course, the rats are telepathic, as is the Phantom, so I guess that could explain it.  However, that's only the beginning of a film that goes so far over-the-top that I suspect it's still in orbit.

The gore and violence, a staple of most Argento films, are present, but not in the abundance that might be expected; there's a decapitation and a tongue being ripped out, in a grotesque parody of a French kiss, and a few more nasty deaths but, all things considered, it could have been worse.  What's not a staple of Argento films is the graphic sex and nudity, (which I'm normally fine with) that includes a bordello scene in which the Phantom's nemesis, Raoul, lies on a chaise lounge, wrapped only in a towel, sucking on a hookah, while surrounded by a phalanx of nightmarish, Fellini-esque characters, all naked and looking like they stopped by the baths enroute to a ""Night of the Living Dead"" shoot.  When a frisky prostitute takes a nose dive beneath Raoul's towel, he's not pleased--he's saving himself for heroine, Christine--and he shoves her away, with no little show of force.  There are two vile, yet somehow Disneyesque ratcatchers, who tool around the sewers beneath the opera house in what looks like a modified dune buggy that snatches up rats and...oh, don't ask.  At about the time that the Phantom unbuttoned his shirt and let some of the more amorous rats run across his chest and nipples, I started getting bug-eyed.  When he got excited and began undoing his pants to allow them access to his manly business, my hair was standing on end.  At that moment, I knew that this movie had gone so far over the mark that it wasn't ever coming back.  And yet, I found myself hoping that these sex partner-rats weren't the Phantom's mum and dad, because that would be just...eeeeuuuuww[...]  And then, of course, a little voice rose within me and said: they're rats, idiot!

Aside from the rats, there are some pretty good performances, believe it or not.  Julian Sands is appropriately weird as the murderous, yet romantic, Phantom of the Opera.  I was disturbed that he didn't wear a mask (disfigured or not) but his long, stringy, greasy hair was fairly eerie in itself.  As demonstrated in earlier efforts such as ""Warlock"", Sands is adept at playing haughty, mysterious creeps who are vaguely aristocratic and mostly evil.  I think if he had portrayed Lestat in ""Interview With the Vampire"" (reportedly Anne Rice's original intention), it would have been an entirely different movie; there's a certain sexual ambiguity that Sands projects onscreen that would have been entirely suited to that character (and which Tom Cruise didn't have).  Plus he looks good naked.  He'd have made a perfect ""Dorian Grey"", as well.  Argento's daughter, Asia, assays the role of Christine, the sopranic understudy who becomes the object of the titular character's affections.  Asia Argento doesn't seem to be sleepwalking so much here as she has in other of her father's films.  She's a lively and passionate heroine who is confused by the two men vying for her charms.  That she beds down with the Phantom on more than one occasion, further muddles the poor girl.  These scenes could have had a genuine erotic power (Argento looks good naked, too) and they are well filmed, but I just kept thinking of what the randy Phantom had been up to with the rats in his pants and...oh brother, I just hope he showered before joining Ms. Argento in bed.  As rival, Raoul, Andrea di Stefano looks a little like Prince in ""Purple Rain"" (only with long, stringy hair--what is it with these guys?)--he's brave, but seemingly addled (perhaps by too much toking on the hookah); by the time, he attempts to save the day, he's moving at a snail's pace through the tunnels beneath the Paris Opera House, looking debauched and disheveled and almost as crazed as the Phantom.

Basically a remake (or re-imagining) of Argento's much better ""Opera"", ""Phantom"" is a freaky, beautifully filmed head trip that, in spite of its many difficulties and ludicrous plot developments, has a certain queasy charm that will definitely not appeal to some.  Dario Argento is an imaginative creative genius who seems incapable of being reigned in, but what would he be otherwise?  I sort of like him like this.",1231200000,3,5129,4.797497155858931
195931,3,1575239701,"THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1998)

Cast: Asia Argento, Julian Sands.

Director: Dario Argento.

Paris Opera understudy Christine Daae (Asia Argento) is mesmerized and corrupted by a human rat and indiscriminate killer known as The Phantom (Julian Sands) who lurks in the bowels of the opera house. However, the mindless prima donna cannot decide between her weird seducer and an equally unappealing nobleman, and the threesome's tiresome sexual excesses eventually result in a nasty mess.

This visually striking but ludicrous film version of Gaston Leroux's famous story unaccountably proved to be the nadir in the illustrious career of Dario Argento, successor to Mario Bava as the master creator of such ultra-violent and brilliantly cinematic Italian ""giallo"" thrillers as THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, DEEP RED, TENEBRAE and THE STENDAHL SYNDROME. Argento had stumbled before (FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET, TWO EVIL EYES and TRAUMA) but never with such promising material and on such a grandiose scale. The debacle of PHANTOM seemed to indicate a premature decline, resulting in a schism among the director's admirers that persists to this day and has negatively impacted acceptance of such superior recent films as MOTHER OF TEARS and GIALLO.

It's been my understanding that Dario Argento made this film under duress, the subject having been chosen for him in a contest-poll of fans. Argento had already created his variation on the theme as one of his best gialli, OPERA/TERROR AT THE OPERA, which displays all the passion, energy and genuine artistry his PHANTOM lacks.

I don't pretend to know what goes on in Argento's bizarre head, but my gut feeling is that he expressed his disinterest and resentment for this unwanted project by deliberately trashing it. It is uninspired, disorganized, and never begins to express the genuinely surreal mystique of Argento's ambitious art films such as SUSPIRIA, INFERNO and PHENOMENA. Most of this unfocused mess could have been ""directed"" by any hack [Luigi Cozzi?], as only a few scenes and choice moments display evidence of the Maestro's usual creativity and high style.

The ill-conceived project shows every sign of having been further botched in the editing process, usually one of Argento's strong points. Unlike most of the artist's films, PHANTOM is based on a literary source, but the narrative structure is hopelessly choppy and confused, with events occurring out of order and a sense of much story footage having been deleted. Far from the mesmerizing, dream-like effect often achieved by the director, the film's sense of flow is undone by the barrage of barely-related scenes crashing one upon the other like a traffic pile-up.

The main problem is the script, written with former Roman Polanski collaborator Gerard Brach, which treats the material as unfunny comedy and unromantic romance and focuses almost entirely on extraneous episodes, and unworkable ""ideas"" such as the Phantom's relationship with rats, while the central story is left to die miserably. Argento and Brach plainly intended a burlesque but turned out a dismal travesty, not ""absurdist"" but abjectly absurd. The notorious low-points are the effete leading man's visit to a sleazy brothel, a slapstick sequence involving the rat-catcher's phallic Ratmobile, and the so-called Phantom's infamous rat-masturbation scene.

Even the obligatory, overdone gore scenes do not grow out of the substance of the piece but seem perfunctorily shoe-horned in. Not only is gross-out gore inappropriate to this story but there is not sufficient blood and guts on display to satisfy the jaded expectations of a contemporary Horror audience likely to be bored silly by the film's dreary pretensions.

The best aspects of the production are the gorgeous Budapest locations, at a sumptuous opera house, in the cellars of a real castle and in actual caves featuring a genuine underground lake. Costumes, except for the Phantom's chintzy-looking cape, are attractive. And there is an appropriately eerie and bittersweet, if listless, music score by the great Ennio Morricone (more absorbing when heard separately on CD). Although several classical pieces are excerpted, there is a notable absence of operatic production.

Even the visual and aural grandeur are diminished by the flat video-photography, poor dubbing and the film's air of cheapness, carelessness and haste. There is also some really awful CGI imagery and a ridiculous animatronic Mother Rat that only a desperate Phantom could love. Overall the film looks suspiciously like a made-for-TV movie that went to theaters instead.

Such a fiasco might have been salvaged if the film offered a reasonably effective Phantom. Although the character wears no mask in this version, there is something unbearably ghastly about his face: it is that of Julian Sands, whose ugly-pretty features (in a fright-wig) are seen throughout. Sands' dire miscasting is the production's central death-blow. Supporting casting and performances are not much better.

Unaccountably, Dario Argento even fumbles the project's golden opportunity as a showcase for his actress daughter, Asia Argento, who appears to have gone through this experience entirely on her own. Generally she is in control, but too often is allowed to flop awkwardly about as if unguided by the director or even a coach. There are also disturbing scenes in which Asia has been instructed by her creepy father to behave like a depraved porno starlet. Still, Asia's distinctive screen presence and offbeat characterization are among the film's primary assets; a forlorn remnant of grace and beauty left standing in the ruins.

Seen in perspective, it is clear that period Gothic Romance is not Dario Argento's gig. Yet such a perverse artist as Argento can make only a fascinating failure. Any viewer interested in the Argentos, the classic story or Euro-Horror cinema should see this film at least once, and some will be drawn back to fathom its odd mysteries.

RATING: 5/10 **  MEDIOCRE.

195932,1,1575239701,"As most Argento fans know, Daria was Dario's partner and collaborator from Deep Red on through Opera. In other words, she helped Dario achieve his great artistic peak that spanned about a decade, and spawned the lead actress of this film, Asia Argento. Well, if Daria can be given shared credit for Dario's greatest successes, perhaps we should blame her absence for this dismal, cheesy atrocity.

I imagine this film would be painful and numbing for any viewer to watch, but it is especially excrutiating for a fan of Argento who has seen the masterpieces of which he is capable. At any rate, I urge everyone to stay far away from this debacle. Watching it is akin to undergoing the sadistic torture that Argento's villains subject their victims to in Dario's other films. You've been warned!

195934,1,1575239701,"Once upon a time, a baby boy was washed into the Parisian sewers, where he was raised by telepathic rats to become the Phantom of the Opera, a serial killer, rapist and rat fetishist.

Yeah, it sounds ridiculous. It IS ridiculous. And Dario Argento is clearly not even trying to make this gory, schizophrenic ""The Phantom of the Opera"" work. Instead, he apparently is determined to eradicate any traces of Gaston Leroux's original novel, and load the remaining shreds down with lots of gore, poor scripting, and a romantic lead that really should be eaten alive by rats.

The baby who would later become the Phantom of the Opera was abandoned by his parents, and raised by a bunch of telepathic rats (I wish I were making this up). This doesn't explain how he learned to walk, talk, dress, wear a ghastly wig, play the organ, write music, and decorate his underground lair -- or why the rats would even do this. But it becomes pretty clear early on that Argento just isn't bothering with logic here.

In due time, the Phantom (Julian Sands) hears the songs of the young diva Christine (Asia Argento), he contacts her and they immediately fall into a passionate love/hate affair. No reason, they just do. And the Phantom's passionate, psychotic attachment to Christine leads to more disgusting deaths, as he tries to make the budding diva into a megastar of the opera -- but his increasing murders lead to possible destruction for both ill-inducing lovers...

My mother likes to tell the story of some people she knew in college -- apparently they had some sort of rat fetish, and would have sex while making rat squeaky noises. As far as I know, they never went to the level of rat masturbation/orgy (as the Phantom does at one point) but it did creep out their roommates.

That story was all I could think about while watching this florid, hysterical, illogical mess, which only has a few scattered names and ideas from Leroux's novel.  The script is simply a disaster -- a muddled mass of bizarre unanswered questions (Telepathic rats? Flaming traps in the sky?) and glaringly predictable ""twists"" -- will the pedophile be horribly killed by the Phantom? Do you need to ask?

Even worse: the dialogue. Argento must have been asleep when he wrote this grotesquerie (""Your sweet female smell flows though my veins like the rolling ocean...""). That goopy adolescent stuff is basically when the Phantom says all the time, when he's not calling people fat cows. And Christine basically just yells all the time that she hates/loves/is going to have sex with him. Just make up your mind already.

It must be admitted that Argento has some magnificently opulent sets, and the whole ratcatcher in his rat-killing go-cart is unintentionally hilarious. But the rest of the time, we're treated to very explicit gore for its own sake -- impalements on a chandelier, tongue ripping, etc. And the whole rat thing is presumably meant to make us squirm, but it just made me wonder if Argento has some sort of furry fetish.

The final indignity to this disaster is the casting. It's weird enough to have a maskless, unscarred Phantom, but Sands is stuck with the role of a crazy, bloodthirsty rapist and murderer, who evokes zero pathos. And Asia Argento (yet again) plays a lusty sexpot who obviously can't sing, and spends most of the movie getting hysterical. The rats give good performances, though.

Dario Argento was obviously not even trying to make a good movie in ""Phantom of the Opera,"" and instead piled on everything that could make it fail. Well, it worked -- it's a florid, hysterical, ghastly mess that lacks anything worthwhile.",1202601600,8,3628,4.808988764044944
195935,2,1575239701,"I am a Phantom fanatic so I was very interested to see what Dario's interpretation of it was.  I have watched it a few times now and I still am not quite sure what to say about it.

First off, this movie is very, very ... very violent!  This one was right up there with ""The Hills Have Eyes"" in my opinion.  I couldn't believe the amount of gore to it.  However, that was an interesting aspect of the story and something only Dario could bring out.

Secondly, there was a lot of nudity and some very sexual scenes.  There were some parts that I have seen in porn videos so if you do watch this movie, be aware that sex is a very prevelant theme.

This movie is probably not something for Lloyd Webber fans.  I went into watching this movie saying, ""I will love anything Phantom related.""  Wrong!  This version is very much based on the monsterous phantom.  He is very into rats and violence and not so much the music.  He is, however, ruggedly handsome with no mask at all.  He is quite normal looking.  Christine actually has a very small role in this movie and is portrayed like more of a porn star than a young, rising opera star.

The movie is just okay but be prepared for sex and gore beyond your imagination.",1180310400,,1215,4.2631578947368425
195936,2,1575239701,"It is not the best movie ever made but it is watchable, mainly due to Morricone's Music and the opera selections. Asia Argento plays the main heroine, young talented opera singer Christine. I don't think she was bad and her face is unbelievably beautiful - she reminds Olivia Hussey of ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1968) and Uma Thurman if Uma ever decides to dye her hair dark. Production values, costumes, special effects, decorations, and the singing voices are very good. I noticed that I laughed a lot during the film - perhaps Argento made a dark comedy of the familiar story?

I did not like Julien Sands as a non-masked Phantom. He looks a lot like the creatures that raised him.

The film has an orgy scene that is so funny it could've came directly from ""Caligula""

Overall - I had a lot of fun, and and can call it one of my guilty pleasures.

195939,3,1575239701,"I have nothing against the idea of doing ""The Phantom of the Opera"" as a splatter flick. But with both Dwight H. Little's 1989 version starring Robert Englund and Dario Argento's effort from 1998 the problem is not the blood and gory but the liberties they take with Gaston Leroux's original novel. For the former it was the idea the Phantom had been marked by the Devil and was pursuing Christine Daae through time, and for the latter it is the idea that the Phantom was raised by rats. If you are not reminded of the flashback in ""Batman Returns"" where the infant Penguin is dispatched in a basket on a river when the parents of the Phantom do the same thing in the opening of this film when they send their baby sailing away on a Paris sewer then it is only because you have not seen both films. Apparently the rats are telepathic, which explains how it is the abandoned infant grows up to speak, play music, and build a pipe organ in the catacombs beneath the opera house.

Unlike the other cover art for this DVD, this one makes it clear that the Phantom, played by Julian Sands, does not wear a mask. This is because he does not need to; there is nothing wrong with his face, but inside he is twisted as a result of being raised by telepathic rats. The rats actually become an important part of the story, but more in a ""Willard""/""Ben"" way than a ""Tarzan of the Apes""/""The Jungle Book"" way. But before we get to them let us consider the changes in the love triangle that Argento and co-writer Grard Brach have come up with for this version of the familiar story.

You can easily pick out the trio from the rest of the cast because they are the ones with long hair. This time around Raoul De Chagny (Andrea Di Stefano) seems to be as warped as the Phantom, although this might because he spends too much time with his brother at a local opium den surrounded by naked people of both sexes and all sizes. The Phantom does not spend a lot of time teaching Christine (Asia Argento, the director's daughter) how to sing, because she is sounds pretty good the first time she gets on stage in the empty Opera House and starts singing high notes. But he does establish a psychic link with her so that instead of fetching her down to his lair he can just send out a call. For all those of you who have been waiting for the Phantom and Christine to consummate their love, this is the version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" to see. The problem is that I do not know why Christine turns on the Phantom or what besides a hail of bullets drives her into Raoul's arms. But then I do not know why the director wants to photograph his daugher naked (my Italian bloodline has been watered down too much I suppose).

Then there are the rats. Ignace (Istvan Bubik), the head rat-catcher has been around for eight years and has killed over 4,000 rats and counting. He keeps tabs by keeping the tails of each rat he kills in a jar of formaldehyde with the month, year, and tail total written on the label. Given that every time a rat gets killed the Phantom must be hearing the rodent equivalent of a death shriek in his mind you would have thought that the Phantom would have tracked down this murderer well before this time, but that is not the case. Instead Ignace has a bad encounter with the rats and decides the best recourse is to invent a killing machine that can be driven around on the smooth floors of the catacombs while it does all sorts of interesting things to the rats it catches.

You keep thinking that the whole rat catching bit is simply comic relief, and for much of the film it is. But it turns out that it is Ignace and not Raoul that the Phantom has to worry about. Besides, as long as Ignace and that pervert passing out Swiss chocolates to the under-aged girls of the corps de ballet is running around, the Phantom is not the biggest monster running around and/or under the opera house. However, if I had to pick a low point in ""Il Fantasma dell'opera"" it would have to be the way Argento caps off the fall of the chandelier with a joke. I was already trying to figure out how what the Phantom was doing with the big mallet would bring around the desired result (although I understood the work was hard enough for him to ditch his shirt), so my confusion turned to dismay when the famous disaster becomes just another joke at the expense of diva Carlotta Altieri (Nadia Rinaldi).

Is this the worst version of ""The Phantom of the Opera""? I have no problem with the idea that it is the least faithful, even compared to Little's movie, but even if you disagree with the changes there are some things of interest here. The opera house in Budapest is gorgeous and there are some nice gory special effects, although certainly not as many as you would expect from Argento and none of them really standout pieces of blood and gore that are seared into your brain forever. The opium den scene is the most memorable scene and it has the least to do with the plot than anything else in the entire film, relying on dozens of bronzed naked bodies to make its impression. Ronnie Taylor's cinematography makes things look good to your eyes even when your brain is complaining about the story. The performances are all adequate, but I found that for me the most sympathetic character ended up being Carlotta: the Phantom attacks her and she still shows up to sing, the strongest moment of anybody in the movie.

Ennio Morricone is credited with the score, and there is also additional music by Maurizio Guarini, but the film makes nice use of actual operatic arias and overtures fom ""Carmen,"" ""Faust,"" ""Lakm: Air des clochettes,"" and ""Romeo & Juliet."" This also makes the film sound classier than it is. This DVD is the unrated director's cut, while you can get the original R-rated version on VHS (I have no idea where it is the gore or sex that makes up the differences). I am not enough of a fan of Dario Argento to be offended by this particular effort and have seen enough liberties be taken with the story of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" to be rather jaded by what happens here and knock off another star. There are enough warnings here and in other reviews to know whether you want to be disappointed either as a fan or the director or of the story.",1135987200,3,6247,4.394987035436474

Beware the haunting cover of the cracked white mask and the protruding blood shot eye and the wicked scream from his mouth. Looks like it could be better than Andrew Lloyd Weber, doesn't it? Well think again. The only thing I did like about this movie was the simulated sex and even that was short and not very interesting. I fast-forward the rest. This is the only Dario movie I saw and heard his work is usually good. Not this time folks. So, stay away. Stay far away.

195943,2,1575239701,"I'm shedding a few tears as I come to the end of my two-year plus journey through Dario Argento's filmography. I've now seen his most celebrated works; films such as ""Deep Red,"" ""Suspiria,"" ""Tenebre,"" ""The Bird With the Crystal Plumage,"" and ""Phenomena."" After I work my way through the rest of his stuff--""Trauma,"" ""The Card Player,"" ""Four Flies on Grey Velvet,"" and a few other odds and ends--it will all be over unless the man makes a few more films before shuffling off this mortal coil. Never again will I watch one of his masterpieces for the first time. Never again will I watch those black-gloved killers rip into a shrieking victim with the same sense of anticipation I held during the first viewing. Ahhh, to go back in time and re-experience the bloody pleasures of Dario's best work! The director has fallen on hard times in recent years, unfortunately, as the quality of his films has dropped precipitously. He just can't seem to recapture the magic of his early days. Oh well. Even a substandard film from Argento is better than the vast majority of horror films on the market today. At least that's what I thought before sitting through the interminable torture that is ""Phantom of the Opera.""

This 1998 take on the classic Gaston Leroux novel ranks as the worst Argento film I've sat through. It's so bad, in fact, that even lesser works like ""Sleepless"" and ""The Stendahl Syndrome"" look magnificent in comparison. The story resembles most of the other versions of the book we've seen over the years, i.e. a social outcast hidden away in the nooks and crannies of an opera house develops an intense fascination with a lovely young singer whose obscurity practically ensures that her new fan will wreak bloody havoc on those around her. The Phantom (Julian Sands), unlike in other versions, bears no discernable disfigurement on his face or his body. He's actually a rather handsome fellow who somehow ended up in a byzantine series of caverns underneath an opera house while still an infant. A pack of telepathic rats raised the young boy to appreciate arias and bloodletting (not necessarily in that order). We learn that the Phantom is a thuggish goon early on when he tears a few workers into bloody shreds as they attempt to perform some work in one of the caverns. We also learn at roughly the same time that the understudy in the opera house's most recent production, Christine (Asia Argento), has caught the eye of the Phantom.

When Christine--greatly despised by the star of the production and generally ignored by the managers--flits onstage at the end of the day to belt out a few sweet sounding notes, the Phantom overhears her and immediately lays plans to win her heart. Clandestine meetings in out of the way places cause Christine to swoon with passion (must be that telepathy thing), but she's not quite sure who this man is or why she feels such joy at his presence. As this lovey dovey nonsense plays out, Argento treats us to a couple of subplots. One involves a pair of greedy lowlifes who think they can go down into the catacombs and find a vast treasure. The Phantom gorily dispatches these two dolts in a scene that, while bloody in an entertaining way, seems to drag on forever. A second thread concerns a greasy looking chap whose sole means of employment revolves around catching rats underneath the opera house. With the help of a diminutive helper, dirty ratcatcher builds a go-cart type device that sucks up rats and chews them up. The scene where we see this vehicle in operation, accompanied by appropriately ""kooky"" music, is wildly unfunny. Anyway, the movie wraps up with Christine oscillating between love and hatred for the hapless Phantom as human authority figures close in for the kill. The end.

Egads, ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is an atrocious film! Only two things help this production avoid a one star review: Asia Argento and the gore. Asia is one absolutely gorgeous gal even though her performance here is mediocre. The gore, thankfully, looks quite good. We've got bodies ripped in half, a nasty looking impalement, crushing by way of chandelier, throats cracking red smiles, and some French guy taking a rifle stock in the face. These things help, but fail to redeem the film. I didn't like the cinematography at all, which looked more like a television production than a feature film. I also didn't care for Julian Sands as the Phantom. He's not disfigured, which is hard to get used to after seeing other film versions, and thus he never really comes across as a sympathetic character. That's an important theme of the story, isn't it? That we come to empathize with this horrible creature? Maybe not. I've never read the book. But I do know a couple of the film versions I've seen embrace this idea. Forget about feeling anything for the Phantom here. To make matters worse, those special effects we see when the Phantom is daydreaming on the roof of the opera house? Embarrassingly cheesy, my friends. Try and watch them without cringing.

Maybe ""Phantom of the Opera"" would have worked better had Dario slapped a pair of black gloves on this dude and given him a case full of funky looking knives. You know, turn it into a giallo. Something, anything would have been preferable to this film. The DVD version of the movie throws us a few extras in an attempt to make us feel better. An interview with Julian Sands, behind the scenes footage, photo galleries, and a text article lifted from Fangoria do little to take away the sting of this rare Argento misfire. Give this puppy a wide berth; you're far better off revisiting a few of the past glories than wallowing in this poor excuse for a horror film.",1123027200,10,5676,4.7477203647416415
195944,4,1575239701,"I liked this version because of it's closer tie with the novel.

Yes, the added ""rats"" and their story line were off beat but preferred by the directors drum. And it would have been 9x's better if he actually had a mask or some form of disfigurement. The director changed the physical with a mental thus the rats.

There were complete areas that were all direct from the novel. And I was very impressed with the addition of the artist Degas!

Roul was a weakly portrayed character but you were so drawn on what was going on between the psychic link of Erik and Christine, you really didn't care. I did understand the Opium den, if it were.

This is one movie where the brother Phillip is actually shown.

He is only hoping to change the mind of his little brother and the scene is meant to show you that Roul does truly love her.

The ending is beautifully done, but again it would of had more of an impact if he did have a mask.

I liked the way they portrayed the underground levels. I did enjoy the fact Erik and Christine finally were able to consume the flesh. More than once:)

And it did have a light sense of humor.

The blood and bones were a little to overdramatic. But that is the kind of art this director portrays.

I also believe that the direction and character of Christine was the best I've ever seen. I saw the true novel's Christine. Her attitude and charisma was perfect.

I would have enjoyed to see the majick itself come from Erik and not the rats. But then the movie would not have stood out so significantly.

Besides, as long as Ignace and that pervert passing out Swiss chocolates to the under-aged girls of the corps de ballet is running around, the Phantom is not the biggest monster running around and/or under the opera house.  However, if I had to pick a low point in ""Il Fantasma dell'opera"" it would have to be the way Argento caps off the fall of the chandelier with a joke.  I was already trying to figure out how what the Phantom was doing with the big mallet would bring around the desired result (although I understood the work was hard enough for him to ditch his shirt), so my confusion turned to dismay when the famous disaster becomes just another joke at the expense of diva Carlotta Altieri (Nadia Rinaldi).

Is this the worst version of ""The Phantom of the Opera""?  I have no problem with the idea that it is the least faithful, even compared to Little's movie, but even if you disagree with the changes there are some things of interest here.  The opera house in Budapest is gorgeous and there are some nice gory special effects, although certainly not as many as you would expect from Argento and none of them really standout pieces of blood and gore that are seared into your brain forever.  The opium den scene is the most memorable scene and it has the least to do with the plot than anything else in the entire film, relying on dozens of bronzed naked bodies to make its impression.  Ronnie Taylor's cinematography makes things look good to your eyes even when your brain is complaining about the story.  The performances are all adequate, but I found that for me the most sympathetic character ended up being Carlotta: the Phantom attacks her and she still shows up to sing, the strongest moment of anybody in the movie.

Ennio Morricone is credited with the score, and there is also additional music by Maurizio Guarini, but the film makes nice use of actual operatic arias and overtures fom ""Carmen,"" ""Faust,"" ""Lakm: Air des clochettes,"" and ""Romeo & Juliet.""  This also makes the film sound classier than it is.  This DVD is the unrated director's cut, while you can get the original R-rated version on VHS (I have no idea where it is the gore or sex that makes up the differences).  I am not enough of a fan of Dario Argento to be offended by this particular effort and have seen enough liberties be taken with the story of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" to be rather jaded by what happens here and knock off another star.  There are enough warnings here and in other reviews to know whether you want to be disappointed either as a fan or the director or of the story.",1106956800,32,6242,4.397391304347826

You cannot have a Phantom without a mask.  And the movie seems to be little more than soft-core pornography.  Gaston Leroux's novel is sensual, but *not* sexual.  Perhaps this would be a good movie for horror/smut fans who have no interest in the actual story of Erik and Christine, but as a devoted Phan, I hated it.",1106524800,13,456,4.317647058823529
195955,2,1575239701,"It pains me to give an Argento film an out and out negative review, but this film really does suck.  2 stars seems a little generous, really, but 1 star seems a little bit too harsh, so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.  Either way, this film certainly isn't recommended to anyone but Argento completists.

Lots of people have complained about how this isn't faithful to the source material, but I've never seen any other version, so I don't really care, and can't comment on that aspect.  Whatever it was originally, here it is a fairly typical Argento film, other than the late 19th century setting, and the decided lack of quality,  I get the feeling that this film was doomed by the relatively low budget, and the fact that the gory horror period piece just doesn't strike me as a workable idea. The film has a somewhat decent look to it, though not up to mainstream American standards, of course, but it seems completely slapped together.  It really doesn't seem complete, like they couldn't afford to make a complete film with their budget, so they just did what they could and pasted it all together.  There's the main plot, the  weird relationship between Christine and the Phantom, which doesn't really go anywhere until the latter portions of the film, and a number of subplots which don't go anywhere in particular other than to provide more victims.  Dario's earlier films weren't necessarily terribly sensical or coherent, but this is by far the worst offender of the ones I've seen.(Deep Red thru Sleepless, excepting Trauma)  This wouldn't matter so much, were it not for the lack of any interesting murder scenes.  It's hard to go into specifics about why a murder scene wasn't cool or interesting, so I guess all I can say is that none of them were.  No tension, pedestrian staging and not much gore of particular interest.  The only gore scene of particular note is when the Phantom rips someone's tongue out with his teeth.  This scene is certainly a lot more funny than it is horrifying, but amusing is amusing.  And I guess there's a nicely done, severely mangled corpse towards the beginning of the film, but nothing else here is all that hot.

The acting is perhaps slightly  above average for an Argento film, but not by a whole lot.  Sands is particularly good as the Phantom, and most everyone else is at least passable, with the exception of the fat lead opera chick, Asia Argento's absolutely abysmal lip-synching during the opera scenes. There's some decent cinematography at times, particularly during the opening portions of the film, but not much innovative or original camerwork.  It's certainly not as visually interesting as prime Argento, and certainly not interesting enough to save this film.  That's about it, as far as positive aspects of the film goes.  Well, I guess the film deserves some credit for the major plot-point being that Christine tries to leave the Phantom after she discovers that he's cheating on her with a bunch of rats.(Yes, that is 100% true)  But that's about it.

Yeah that's it.  This film isn't boring I guess, but it's a long way from good.",1104019200,5,3111,4.750465549348231

I am a huge fan of Leroux for his tale which shines off a classic story of love and mystery. The careful treatment that Hal Prince and A.L.W. gave to the story created an incredible and haunting show, and the ONLY phantom is Michael Crawford. He loved this character, and made a whole new outlook on Erik, as a tragic and enigmatic figure. All of these things come together to create a story which I adore and has evidently gained admiration from oh so many others.
Maybe this director was bored or something. Tossed ideas around..wanted to make an artistic statement..
First of all, this Phantom isn't horrifcally deformed but passable in appearance. You know that mask on the cover? Don't let that make you think that it's even THAT true to the story. The famous unmasking scene is left out, instead showing the guy abusively tossing her about. A Michael Crawford, he certainly is not. All this Phantom is is a flat character;a psycho with a passion for rats *another moronic change in the story* and a killer with bizarre methods. I (and hopefully you) could do without the gruesome rat trap effect..with a bunch of moving dying creatures in it..And the view of Christine as a Pin-up. Thanks for showing off the animalistic side of the phantom, but we have the rest of the movie to be sicked out of.
The number one thing that bothered me..The Phantom and Christine's relationship. Erik is supposed to be honorable to her in the sense that he never touches her, like the mere idea of love is forbidden to him. This Phantom takes advantage happily..and Christine really does not give off the array of innocense that makes her character so powerful and keeps the story afloat.
Not to spoil it for you, but the end is worthy of an oscar for most overdone and SAD excuse for a SOAP OPERA I have ever seen. Although..the music and the last shot of the film was somewhat ethereal.
Some of the cinematography is beautiful, I must admit, and the costumes are tops.
But hey..if you don't like the original story, or the show, this might float your boat when in the mood for upclose blood guts and gore and horrendous acting.

What we do get however, is some over the top gore (well served, of course) but for this movie it simply doesn't apply.  It seems also that handling romantic situations isn't Argento's cup of tea.  The love story between Christine and the Phantom gets more ridiculous as the movie progresses.  The brothel scene is a bit hard to take.  And finally, the humour misses big time.
That said, a bad Argento film is not a total bore at all.  Julian Sands is good as the phantom and is not to blame for the movie being unsuccessful, the music is wonderful and we at least get a very original take on this often filmed classic.",1087948800,,881,4.718954248366013
195960,3,1575239701,"The Phantom of the Opera (Dario Argento, 1998)
Okay, so both Julian Sands and Asia Argento are pretty standard definitions of sex on a plate. Put them together in one of history's finest love stories, add in a director whose work is called operatic, you've got a formula for success.
The existing reviews of this film seem to be polarized. There is the crowd who liked either the book or the loathsome Rice/Webber monstrosity that managed to mass-hypontize Broadway into thinking it was worthwhile. They all hate the movie. And then there is the crowd who worships Dario Argento. They... well, like the movie. Kind of. And there are a core of fans who think it's the best thing since sliced bread.
I think I fall into the middle section. I thought it was enjoyable, if a bit amateurish (Asia Argento's lip-synching in the singing scenes is quite painfully amusing, for example). A very interesting take on the story. Argento keeps to gore to a minimum here, at least, for Argento, preferring to take the operatic moniker and apply it to the cinematography, the performances, etc. It works well enough, but it just doesn't say Argento. One wonders if there were another fledgling director under whose name they were planning on releasing the movie (e.g., Demons, directed mostly by Argento but bearing the name Lamberto Bava); Asia, perhaps?
In any case, one of my rules of film viewing is never pass up a chance to see Asia Argento naked. And this is one of them. ***",1075334400,3,1467,4.734375

195963,3,1575239701,"Every film Dario Argento has directed from the 90s to the present day has a large number of folks who bash it because it's ""not like his classic stuff"".  These films have their fans, many people liked The Stendahl Syndrome, but every film has been a mixed bag of reviews.  Argento is trying new stuff(or at least stuff he hasn't tried before) all the time, and it usually comes back to bite him in the butt....because it's not like his classic stuff, see?
His take on Phantom of the Opera seems to be the main offender.  Say what you want about Trauma, Giallo or Sleepless, most folks I think try to forget this film exists.
I certainly don't hate it, I see it as a failed experiment but it has it's moments.  In this story, The Phantom(though he doesn't appreciate this title.  ""I'm not a phantom, I'm a rat"" he says) is a boy who was abandoned and thrown downstream(kinda like the Penguin in Batman Returns).  He is saved and raised by rats.  Yes, raised by rats.  Somehow, being raised by rats has given The Phantom telepathic powers and a British accent.  He lives in the catacombs under the Paris opera house and occasionally terrorizes and kills the opera house staff and patrons, especially if they get close to his lair.
When he sees Christine, he goes bonkers over her.  He approaches her immediately and she falls head over heels for him on the spot.  They carry on a relationship until the whole thing becomes too much for Christine with The Phantom murdering everyone in his path and getting his jollies from rats.
One of the biggest flaws here is that Argento goes for more humor than he ever has before in one of his horror films.  Most of it revolves around the opera house rat catcher and Christine's obese nemesis, Carlotta.  It really doesn't work. Comedy is not Argento's strength.
Argento doesn't go hog wild with the camera either, keeping it rather still and reserved.  Some goofy CGI is sprinkled throughout, and there is a bit of decent gore here and there.
I love Julian Sands, and I think he was a good choice.  Unfortunately the script hinders him, and he looks kinda like a goth rocker from the 80s.  Not quite right for the time period this is taking place in.  Same with the ride-on rat lawnmower thing the rat catcher builds.  I guess if this was supposed to be steampunk, but I don't think it is.
Asia is once again playing a chick with some severe psychological baggage.  I'm not sure she can play a role without coming across like a total headcase.  Here she flipflops from being nuts about The Phantom to immediately hating him when he asks her to wait at his lair until he comes back, then being madly in love once again after he's shown that he's insane.  I've never had the hots for Asia that many guys seem to have, but in this movie I think she looks very pretty.  She doesn't actually sing her parts, but she really pantomimes it very well.
I think the high point of this movie is the look.  The set design is actually great.  The opera house and the catacombs all look very, very good.  The whole movie is pretty much lit by candles and fireplaces, which is cool looking.  It sucks that the DVD presentation is so awful looking, you can't really appreciate all that.  It's Pan & Scan, dark and grainy, giving a made for TV look.  Too bad coz I doubt somebody will release a better version.
I know I'm not changing anybody's mind here, as this will most likely be Argento's most hated film.  Well, what can I say, I kinda liked it.",1049155200,,3472,4.458003169572108
195964,2,1575239701,"After one viewing of this ""hip"" and gory version of the classic Gaston Leroux story, I couldn't believe that a great actor like Julian Sands actually agreed to be in a film with such a terrible script (trust me, this movie totally butchers the original tale to no end and reduces the Phantom to an incredibly inconsistant and unbelievable character). I found it even harder to believe that Dario Argento (a man who brought us such horror classics as ""Suspiria"" and ""Tenebrae"") would spend so much money on gorgeous sets and a decent cast only to see his efforts ruined by a re-working of the original story that simply DOES NOT WORK. Damn it, if it's not broken, DON'T FIX IT!!!
 The characterization of the Phantom is quite screwy here, to put it mildly. He's born illegitimately to a poor mother and abandoned in a small raft on the river Seine. He washes up in a grotto beneath a Paris opera house and is ""adopted"" by a brood of rats (instead of being eaten, which is probably what would really happen...). Then we see a cornball dialog card (read by a narrator) telling us how the baby forms a bond with the forces of darkness...
 Flash forward about three decades. A beautiful singer/understudy at the opera house (Asia Argento) is trying to make a name for herself while the Phantom lurks in caverns beneath the building. A team of construction workers break into the Phantom's world unintentionally and provoke his wrath (all are brutally slaughtered). The Phantom (at no point called ""Eric"") then starts creeping through secret passages in the opera house and he becomes enchanted by Christine's singing. When he finally introduces himself to her, he is not a masked and disfigured monster, but a handsome, washed, long haired gent with a perfect command of language (give me a break...HE WAS RAISED IN A SEWER BY RATS!). Despite his animalistic and savage tendencies, the Phantom falls in love with Christine, and he plays an organ in his cave to accompany her singing after he introduces her to his ""world""...did the rats teach him how to play the organ, too? Yeah, sure, the Phantom is depicted as having some sort of telepathy that lets him see into peoples' minds, but this is a very weak plot device, and it just doesn't adequately explain how the Phantom knows so much about the world above his pit.
 Christine is soon torn between her dapper and decent admirer, Raoul, and the animal magnetism of the Phantom. When the Phantom gets wise to this, trouble starts brewing, and he gets obsessive and jealous. Meanwhile, he savagely murders a couple of nosey stagehands who intrude upon his ""world"" (he impales a man on a stalagtite and chews a woman's tongue off in a scene very similar to the tongue chewing scene in ""Warlock""). Also, the Phantom shows his humane side when he partially eats a would be child molestor who chases one of the opera's young dancers into the catacombs (he then sends the child home with a pat on the cheek...?).
 The Phantom's downfall comes about after he executes a revenge plot after Christina is passed over for the female lead in a musical production of ""Romeo and Juliet"".  He drops a gigantic chandelier onto the audience during the performance (it crushes bodies and tears off heads). The opera house exterminator then suddenly appears on the stage and tells the enraged audience survivors that he has seen Christina copulating with the Phantom in the caverns...mob madness follows, and Raoul leads Christina into the pits to save her, where they encounter the Phantom, who holds off the mob (at the cost of his own life) as they escape in a boat. Earlier in the film, the Phantom is portrayed as a blood thirsty monster with super-human strength, but when the gun toting mob closes in on him, he softens up and stands between them and the fleeing couple and is gunned downed accordingly. So, he must truly love Christine...but how he ever learned about love in a sewer, I'll never know.
 The subplot involving the opera house rat exterminator is entirely unnecessary. He builds a souped up ""rat sweeper"" hotrod with slicing blades and takes it into the tunnels...keep in mind that the movie takes place in 1877, so we're talking cornball ""Wild, Wild West"" sci-fi technology here. In any event, the crazed exterminator is instrumental in the Phantom's defeat and execution.
 This film exploits gore to make up for a weak story, but the only genuinely disturbing scene in the movie is when the Phantom takes his shirt off and let's his rat ""brothers"" crawl all over his body...Sand's look of masturbatory ecstasy in this scene is delightfully revolting.
 Phantom fans and ""completists"" should probably view this film just so they can say that they've seen it, but the true horror fan would do better to stick to the classic versions and avoid this one entirely.  entirely.",1047600000,7,4821,4.777911164465786

However, I'm a fan of the Broadway play and was hoping to find a motion picture that would do the story justice. Well, this film is not it. And I don't think I have to wait to see all the other versions to say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this one is one of the worst (if not THE...).
The list of dissapointing factors is too long to post in this forum. But, let's just start with the first 5 minutes of the movie. Eric (the Phantom) is shown as a newborn baby being carried inside a basket by a weeping woman. He is thrown into the river for no apparent reason and later is rescued from going down a waterfall by none other than a rat. This mighty rodent is strong enough to pull baby Phantom out of the water (against the current, mind you) and into safety.
The film goes forward in time some 30 years and we learn that Eric has been raised in the depths of the city by the rats. Despite this, he's grown into a well groomed, slightly skinnier version of Fabio, with long blonde hair, and fingernails that don't seem to go a week without being manicured. This guy looks so good, he doesn't need a mask. As a matter of fact, he never wears one.
If this Fabio-lized version of the Phantom has one defect it's that he has a knack for cannibalism... oh, and he likes to have rats crawling all over his naked chest and down into his pants.
Christine and Raoul look more like brother and sister than lovers in this movie. It's probably better that way, though. This Raoul looks so feminine and weak that it'd be weird to think of him as a leading man. Christine is no gem either.
We could, in the interest of fairness, forget about the fact that this movie has very little to do with the original story, or the Broadway play, and that the casting seems to have been done by a teenager who loves soap operas; and try to critique it as a work of art on its own metits. Even then, I'd still have to say that this is a horrible film. I haven't seen acting this cheesy since Earth Girls Are Easy. Besides that, the screenplay seems like it was written by a drunk. There are scenes that leave you just scratching your head, wandering what they were thinking.

Sands' phantom is not all monsterous, he also shows some human emotion and even cries when he sees his beloved Christine find comfort with another man.

195970,2,1575239701,"Actually, this movie is a disgrace to the title made famous by Andrew LLoyd-Webber.  Julian Sands would have been better served if he had done the third and final installment of the Warlock movies that were so popular, if somewhat campy.
First of all, a phantom should have some form of facial deformaty.  I saw no flaws on Sands face or body. At least David Staller had a deformaty in the disgraceful stage version done in English.  It does amaze me though, that all of these recent ""Phantoms"" have white teeth, Stallers are straight and bonded for stage presence, like Crawford's, Lom's, and Dance's.
Secondly, at least the directors didn't force Sands to sing. Like Englund, I had no idea he had any musical ability at least enough to play the big pipe organ in his lair.  This is why I gave it one of two stars.
This second star came when he protected the ballerina, a young girl, from an 'overexcited' patron with chocolate. I never thought he was human until this scene.  Watch the movie to see what I mean.
The rat scene after the Phantom and Christine made love the first time turned my stomach, but it did make me laugh to see Charles Dance dump a trunkful of rats on Carlotta in the 1990 version.  It still cracks me up.  Carlotta got off easy in this version with Sands.
His mind was definitely ""disturbed"".  Being raised in a sewer with rats might do that. He acts like a spoiled child when he doesn't get the 'attention' he thinks he deserves from Christine a second time.  Sorry but you will have to watch the movie to see what I mean here, too.  We all know she has had previous experiences with men because she walks out on stage in her slip and doesn't even blush about it.
Yes, the costumes were great as was the locale, but there was no plot.  There may have been a previous psychic connection but we, as viewers, don't see any evidence in the beginning when the Phantom says, ""Read my thoughts"".  We also have to draw our own conclusions when he yells, ""Look toward the light!""",1016496000,,1997,4.441095890410959

The movie is dark, and has a dark theme, the costuming is very good, and the location is fabulous, but that is about all I can say for this movie. It is so far from anything--the Leroux, Webber, even the Robert Englund, it should have more nudity, which is why I gave it 2 stars. Julian Sands is a great actor, and I feel he was wasted here. We are supposed to put aside all knowledge of every other Phantom story, and believe the disfigurement in this tale is on the inside, which it must be: Sands has a weird and gross affinity with the rats in this movie. After he abducts Christine, he takes her to his lair, where he makes love to her. He rises later, and she goes looking for him, only to find him covered in rats, which are drinking his blood and licking the remains of his union with Christine off his unwashed body. Sick! Asia Argento is no Christine Daae'. Her looks are too dark, and she seems out of it all through the movie. The dubbing of her voice during the Romeo & Juliette is applauded; her speaking voice is bad enough without having to hear her trying to sing. Her portrayal of Christine misses...lacks the human aspect; she does not have that vulnerability all female singers identify with that make us want to portray Christine. This was an ambitious undertaking that failed miserably. If you watch this movie for anything, it is sort of humorous, on a sick level, from the point of view that it is so far-removed from the other stories.",1015718400,4,1555,4.36551724137931

195973,2,1575239701,"I really couldn't tell. To some extent, it was a regular horror movie (even though I found myself laughing out loud during the ""scary"" parts), but sometimes I thought it was, in turn, a comedy, a parody of horror movies, drama or porn. It was a mixture of all kinds of genres, and the result was very confusing. All of the scenes went in completely different directions, and the film didn't follow the usual rules of dramatical narrative. I had the feeling this film must have at least 14 different directors!
The greatest disadvantage of this movie was its lack of focus. There was really nobody you could identify with, nobody you cared about and could follow throughout the movie. The characters were inconsistent and shallow. You never found out anything about their personality - they acted one way one moment and another way the next. The acting left a lot to be desired on most parts. Most of the (bad) special effects seemed to serve no other purpose than shock value. The result was often unintentional comedy.
As for faithfulness to the original story, some incidents, like the chandelier falling, were there. The character of the Phantom himself was very altered, though. For one thing, he wasn't hiding in the catacombs and killing people because he was disfigured (he wasn't!) and bitter, but rather because he, well, was fond of rats! It's true he did make a sacrifice for Christine at the end, but this good deed came completely of the blue, so you never really felt for him (i.e. it's hard to have compassion for someone who tears out the tongue of a helpless woman with his teeth!).
So why do I give this film 2 stars instead of 1? Well, it does have a few redeeming qualities, like nice sets, creative camera technique and - at least that can be said for it - originality...",999043200,,1792,4.638364779874214
195982,3,1575239701,"This is not the best version of Phantom, but it's not terrible either. It might be best to refer to this as an interpretation of the Gaston Leroux book and not simply a film version of the book.
The opening scene makes me think of Batman Returns as the basket carrying The Phantom as an infant journeys along a watery path undergound. He is rescued by a rat who drags him ashore. (I wonder if his name was Ben - the rat from Willard and the sequel Ben.) You actually see the red-eyed rat pulling the basket. He is raised by the rats just as Tarzan was raised by apes and The Penguin was raised by underground penguins in Batman Returns. I'm starting to thinking Tim Burton was a bigger influence here.
The Phantom is not physically deformed at all. He is handsome and has telekinetic and mind control abilities. As you can imagine, he doesn't seem to like the rat catcher and causes him to harm himself.
You do have a newspaper reporter walking around trying to solve the mystery of the events going on at the opera house. He seems to almost represent Leroux. In the book, Leroux is studying the strange events at the Paris Opera - but after all of the events have passed, not during.
You also have Mame Giry looking after The Phantom's box. ...or at least a character representing her.
Although it's not completely accurate, I usually envision Carlotta as she is presented here - only not this big. The attitude she displays here is an exaggeration of her attitude in other versions of the story.
I'm annoyed with the managers being shown as having a thing for young girls. It doesn't fit their characters or anyone else's. I have no idea where the idea came from. It had to be an external source and not Leroux's book.
Some of the camerawork is nice, but I don't care for the level of gore presented. Personally, I think it's more graphic than the Robert Englund version. The 1989 version was bloody, but it was not like this. Here you see the remains of a worker torn in half. You have a man who had his thumb partially eaten by rats, and there is a close-up of him bending his thumb with the bone showing.
The Phantom himself had me wondering what Patrick Stewart might look like with long hair. My first impression was that The Phantom looked like an evil Fabio. Then I started thinking of Capt. Picard as a hippie. However, Raoul is presented here with long hair too - braided I believe. You don't hear much about people having long hair in Paris in the 1890s so I'm curious how historically accurate this might be. Gentleman from that period are typically shown with short hair. However, filmmakers have been known to take some liberty with facts.

This was not at all the vision set in the Learoux novel.  Now if you are a fan of the Lloyd Webber musical, then most definatly stay away from this.

The basic story is the same  as in the other versions in that he kidnaps a young opera singer (Asia  Argento) and murders people so that she can sing in Romeo and Juliet at the  Paris opera.  Unfortunately, storytelling was never really Argento's strong  point and here the need for a proper narrative defeats him entirely.  The  relationship between Sands and Asia is dealt with in a hurried 2m scene  near the beginning and therefore most of the running time is padded out  with irrelevant murders and other scenes of depravity which are  occasionally interesting in themselves but don't advance the narrative and  could easily have been removed without anyone noticing.  A few scenes are  also really weird and out of kilter particularly a scene set in a bathhouse  brothel featuring lots of naked, fat people and a long scene in which the  rat catcher and his dwarf sidekick whiz through the underground caverns on  a motorised rat killing machine which then crashes and decapitates the  dwarf.  And what about the wacko hallucinations the phantom has sitting on  the obviously fake roof of the opera ?  Visually it looks splendid and the  Hungarian operahouse locations also look authentic and great.  Lovely  photography which is in tune with the depraved nature of the subject matter  by its use of a soupy yellow haze.  Several very gory scenes (body ripped  in half, tongue pulled out, hand eaten by rats) but even these lack any  real flair and have negligible suspense compared to Argento's traditonally  tour-de-force murders.  There's even an anti-climatic ending in which the  phantom is merely shot by the police.  Must be seen as a major  disappointment.

Easily the maestro's weakest since Inferno (which married gorgeous visuals to the least involving story in Argento's entire career). The flaws here are  massive, starting with a surprisingly poor script from Gerald Brach. It's  interesting that Argento's first collaboration with an acclaimed  screenwriter is also the worst script he's ever filmed. Acting is very  uneven, although the dubbing doesn't allow for complete critiques. Sands  tries hard, but the phantom has been rewritten in such a silly manner that  he's ultimately working in vain. Asia Argento looks great, as usual, but  she's just wrong for the part. Idiotic elements abound, the violence is  unimpressive and inserted seemingly at random, the material involving the  rats is just stupid and silly. Dario's camerawork is shockingly restrained  and conservative, as if the period setting caused him to quell his usually  baroque techniques. It's those techniques, though, that make him unique and  inimitable. Here he seems too mannered. Attempts at comedy mostly fall  short of being funny, and there's far too many of them - Dario shouldn't do  comedy, as Five Days in Milan ably demonstrated. On the plus side, the  cinematography is beautiful, creating probably the most accurate recreation  of the period i've ever seen. Ennio Morricone's music is lovely, although  not as good as his work for The Stendhal Syndrome. And there's a dwarf.  Argento works best with modern settings, attitudes, and ideas, and this  failed experiment at a period piece is hopefully just that - a failed  experiment and not a new direction. Besides, the director already covered  this material in Opera (aka Terror at the Opera) in 1989, giving it an  amazingly cold, nihilistic, and misanthropic attitude that's far more  impressive than this film's more ""polite"" approach.

His take on Phantom of the Opera is  so full of holes, lapses in character logic and acting atrocities that it's  barely recognizable as an Argento film, other than his trademark gory  murders, which are even more forced than ever on this film (the tongue  scene, especially -- once the actress stuck her tongue out ready for the  shot, I fell backwards laughing).
The most grievous wound in this movie's  side is the casting of Asia Argento -- her youth and everygirl appeal  livened up Trauma and her intensity and strength rescued The Stendhal  Syndrome, but here, playing Christine Daae, she falls completely short.  The one thing Asia lacks is highbrow presence, and she's never been great  at playing the fragile victim.  So here, stuck with a role where she  basically has to scream and cry and be a complete puppet to the male  characters, Asia looks positively embarrassed, especially during those  ridiculous opera scenes.  While in the past she's managed to raise the  standards of acting in her father's films, in this one she sinks like a  rock.
The overall sound design of the film is off-kilter -- dialogue is  frequently in poor sync with the image (a common Argento problem -- too  much ADR?).  Most of the time there's no sense of real ambience; you almost  never buy that characters are really talking in certain spaces; they always  sound like they're talking in a studio.
Some plus sides:  Julian Sands is  a visually interesting phantom (though the script can't seem to decide what  the real love/hate relationship between Christine and the Phantom is,  resulting in a central relationship with no emotional impact whatsoever);  the Ennio Morricone score fits the setting and mood; and moments of humour  (the rat exterminator's machine is hilarious) help redeem the film  somewhat.
The DVD bonus material is abundant, though as with quite a few  ""behind the scenes"" sections that I've seen, there lacks a strong  directorial hand in the editing -- the behind-the-scenes footage is just  pieced together, with no sense of direction or coherence.  It *is* amusing  to watch Asia's interaction with Dario on set, if only we'd gotten more of  it.  The Fangoria article and filmographies are a great touch, but the  Julian Sands article makes Sands come across as one of the most  inarticulate human beings on earth.
For die-hard Argento fans only.",946857600,6,2554,4.92
196010,3,1575239701,"After the dissappointments of Two Evil Eyes, Trauma, and The Stendahl Syndrome, Dario Argento has returned to form (well, sort-of) with The Phantom of the Opera. The script is by Roman Polanski collaborator Gerard  Brach, and the film is gorgeously shot by Ronnie (Opera) Taylor. The murder  scenes are pretty cool (the chandelier scene is awesome), but Dario needs  to go more balls-out like he did with Opera and Suspiria. Not bad, but  knowing Dario's work, it could be alot better.",945734400,2,485,4.950617283950617

Boy, do not make the same mistake I did. This is a beautiful movie in that the sets, the opera house, and the lair are all phenomenal, but the phantom has long hair and no mask and he's just a pervert who puts rats down his pants.

7798854,2,1575239701,"Usually when you bring in a talented director weaving a unique twist on a classic tale I enjoy, a fine actor who I enjoy, and a more than competent lead heroine that I enjoy, you get a film that I , uh, enjoy.

 But somehow, somewhere, up in the magical world of cinema, something went strangely awry.

 Perhaps it was the attempted backstory of the Phantom. Placed in a basket as a baby viva-la-Moses, the young menace to the opera was raised and nurtured by rats(!). Although taught strictly by his furred parents, he somehow managed to learn perfect English and obtain some nice clothing. As an adult he falls for the lovely Christine, acted (and sung) by Asia Argento.

 Now that we have the basic plot out of the way, I'll sift through some of the weaker spots. One thing that bugged me was attempted humor injected throughout; instead of amusing me it annoyed, botching some seriousness the movie could have held.

By humor here I mean some of the deaths - although, really, maybe they weren't even meant to be humorous and I simply took them that way. But it's hard not to find some of the slaying comical, particularly the giant opera singer where Sands grabbed her breasts. Being brutal and mildly gruesome, yet at the same time holding an aura of cruelty, the deaths are different in their own way, just not that enjoyable.

 The supposed love story didn't exactly scream ""romance"" either. More like raw primal lust. Perhaps it was the ""rat side"" of the Phantom acting out. Thankfully Julian Sands is yummy eye candy for the female viewers, Asia Argento delicious for the men.

Christine's character shoots from being a bit too doe-eyed and innocent to a bit too bratty and rebellious. Her fascination with the unmasked Phantom seems just that...curiosity, not love. Her frustration and anger when in his lair came out convincing however, and I couldn't help but wonder if she was a tucked away precious love token...or a kidnapped sex slave.

The ending was probably the only scene to demonstrate the true depth of their feelings - Phantom ended on a truly tragic note.

Perhaps if the plot made a bit more sense, if a little more had been explained on the rats and the powers, it could have been something more. If for nothing else, concentrate on the dolled up, singing Argento or the long-haired sensual Sands (just fast forward through the scene of him sitting nearly nude with rats crawling all over him please.)",1379635200,,2428,4.687058823529412

I've always been pleased by phantom retakes, but especially this one.  This isn't a soft little flowery version of the classic- this is the real deal, that would have made Gastron Leroux clapping and saying encore from his grave.  It is gory like a slasher flim, but that is Dario Argento's style, and I have to say I like it. Everytime I watch this movie I cant help but think how luckly that woman was to be his obsession, and it doesnt hurt that the phantom is very hot,purrrrrrrr. The phantom doesn't have a scarred face, but a very disterbing kind of personality and is a little insane, Yet at the same time the love scenes are very passionate and touching between Christine and her Phantom Eric. This movie is not for the faint of heart, there is gore, sex, nudity, and disturbing situations but that is Dario Argento's way of doing things- well done,Dario,Well done",1375315200,,1005,4.416216216216216
