8052742,3,B0007WFUBU,great history!,1428969600,,14,6.5
8052743,5,B0007WFUBU,"This is a great documentary teaching tool, a tribute to the inventiveness and ingenuity God has given man. It's much more too, it's interesting, entertaining, instructional, and at the same time just plain enjoyable. This Modern Marvels Series of construction shows the great engineeing feats done is America. Can't really say enough about them",1379116800,,344,5.388888888888889
8052744,5,B0007WFUBU,Great Value! It was a really great and awesome movie and I couldn't find it any cheaper any where else.,1376784000,,103,4.2
8052745,4,B0007WFUBU,"This was really good. I watched it after seeing the 1981 Ken Burns's America: Brooklyn Bridge.

While this Modern Marvels program lacks the human drama, and artistic feel, of Burns's program, you will see more detail of the bridge construction in this one.

The detail is not better done than in Burns' work, but there is more of it, and this topic demands a good bit of detail on how the 8th Wonder was put there!

I recommend that you view both, and view the Burns film first. I agree that narrator Earl Boen sounds a bit like a TV game show host, or, Paul Harvey.",1368921600,,566,4.320754716981132
8052746,3,B0007WFUBU,"I ordered this after reading David McCullough's book (The Great Bridge) about the Brooklyn Bridge. I thought that the DVD was okay but not as good as I expected.  My disappointment was perhaps due to trying to compare it with McCullough's book, which was really excellent.",1363046400,,272,4.913043478260869
8052747,5,B0007WFUBU,"I first became interested in the Brooklyn Bridge from having watched part of a presentation on the History Channel.  The building of the Brooklyn Bridge was an amazing feat considering the equipment available to workers more than 120 years ago.
I read the book ""The Brooklyn Bridge"" first and then bought and watched the DVD.  The combination of having read the book and then watching the DVD made it all come alive with the characters and time.  The DVD is a fantastic presentation of the design and building of the Brooklyn Bridge.",1359244800,,533,4.771739130434782
8052748,3,B0007WFUBU,"There are many engineering marvels in the world and the Brooklyn Bridge is certainly one of them.  This hour long DVD focuses on the design and construction of this great bridge, but misses some of the interesting details that I have seen in other DVD historys on the same subject.  But for the price I am glad to have it in my collection of engineering marvels.",1301184000,,362,4.46969696969697
8052749,4,B0007WFUBU,"This is a special on the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge which I didn't catch until approximately twelve years after it was produced (in 1995).  When first I saw it, I was trying not to expect anything, what with my loyalty to the 1981 documentary by Ken Burns (his first ever).  However, I did find this one a highly enjoyable documentary, informative and including plenty of common ties with the earlier special, plus some other nuggets of information (such as the role the Brooklyn Bridge played in the merger of the 5 Boroughs).

I only give it four stars out of five, because I do feel the conveyance of historical accounts worked better with the dramatic role-playing of the earlier bridge documentary (Paul Roebling, Arthur Miller, etc).  However, the historians' interviews and the one with Kristian Roebling do give the depiction of the saga a great, human element.  (Kristian is a descendent of John A. Roebling (the bridge designer) and his son, Washington A. Roebling (the builder).)",1233014400,6,999,4.958083832335329
8052750,5,B0007WFUBU,"I saw this on the history channel- twice! I loved it so much
that I thought about it hours after I had seen it. You cannot
imagine the pain and suffering and hard work that went into
building this bridge at a time that there was no technology
like we have today. This bridge was built on pure mathematics.
and assumptions that ""in theory, it should work!""
Worth watching - twice!!",1198540800,8,380,4.366197183098592
8052751,5,B0007WFUBU,This is a very excellent sorce for home schooling . We need to have rewards sometimes and this is a perfect opportunity to have a history lesson in action. Please consider how the effects of the movie will drive home the history of our nation.,1172534400,5,243,4.4222222222222225
