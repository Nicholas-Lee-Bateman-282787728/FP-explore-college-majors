8390455,1,B0037BCY8U,Very weak exercise and poor video quality. A waste of time and money. I regret to say that I  would not recommend this to anyone.,1403654400,2,129,4.16
8390456,3,B0037BCY8U,"When I've tried learning Tai Chi for beginners there was a warm up and a slow demonstration of how to do basic moves ""before"" getting into a whole routine. In this video, you are basically watching the people do the routine and trying to follow along without having learned the basic moves yet. And since there is no basic instructional of the moves, when the camera changes angles or moves in for a close-up of the hands you can't see what the rest of your body should be doing. I wouldn't recommend this for new people at all. However, I am very glad that she has come up with a way to do movement like this and worship the One True God. I will, however, be going to the library today to get a tai chi video so I can learn how to do the basic steps and then maybe I can follow the Christian one.",1356566400,10,797,4.115384615384615
8390457,3,B0037BCY8U,"I bought this DVD for my boys. I wanted to add it as an alternative to yoga for them. They don't have the longest attention span and need to have things mixed up a bit to keep it interesting. We have non-hearing family members so I love that they are learning more ASL. The only complaint that we have (& it does make it tough) is that sometimes they zoom in so close that you can't see exactly what they are doing. Being new to this workout and unfamiliar to these terms, not being able to see makes it difficult and frustrating. I'm sure that this will get easier over time and is a small price to pay to have such a wonderful workout option that falls in line with our belief system. Thanks guys.",1326412800,3,699,4.185185185185185
