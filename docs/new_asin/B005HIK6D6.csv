8473100,5,B005HIK6D6,"Rich Graham is a master at coaching and he delivers, as usual, in his Kettlebell DVD video series. Keep in mind that this is not a traditional kettlebell instructional video, instead, this this video demonstrates a blend of training techniques performed with a kettlebell. Navy SEAL Kettlebells will show you many interesting ways and angles to train your body and is very well suited for follow along training.",1506384000,,411,5.0588235294117645
8473101,3,B005HIK6D6,"I purchased this dvd as an introduction to kettlebell exercises.  What it contains are mainly dumbell based exercises instead of the 6-7 established core kettlebell lifts, i.e. swing, clean, clean and press, high pull, snatch, squat, get-up.  When I read foundations in the title, I was
expecting those foundation exercises specific to the kettlebell.
Afterward, I purchased the Skogg system dvds as a second attempt at a kettlebell introduction.  These proved a great introduction to the foundation kettlebell exercises that i was expected.",1347580800,9,541,5.493975903614458
8473102,5,B005HIK6D6,"When Rich started training me, I had just completed chemotherapy and had rebuilt my bone density to an acceptable level.  He assured me that I could get strong and rebuild my body.  We started slow and steady, and as my confidence grew, so did my strength.  At 45+ years old, it was important for me to feel safe, focused, energetic, challenged and Navy SEAL Kettlebells provided me with all of it!",1317772800,,398,4.577464788732394
8473103,5,B005HIK6D6,"As a cheerleading coach, I am always looking for new ways to challenge my athletes. This DVD taught me a lot of amazing new ways to train my body and in turn train my athletes with a high intensity work-out. I LOVE it. You can implement the training skills you learn on this DVD in almost any environment and really give your body the work-out its been waiting for. Do yourself a favor, and try it out for yourself. Thanks Rich!!!!",1316131200,,431,4.333333333333333
8473104,5,B005HIK6D6,"But it is well worth it! I found out about Richard Graham and Trident Fitness, LLC through the Special Operations Warrior Foundation on Facebook. I thought what the heck and ordered their Navy SEAL Kettlebell Level 1 DVD to try out. I was an avid gym goer last year, but decided I needed to try something new to keep my level of fitness up, and found that gyms were definitely not for me. For someone starting out with kettlebells this DVD is a must buy! Provides a safety foundation, exercises to promote grip strength, and exercises for your core, and upper and lower body. I plan on purchasing the next two DVDs in the next month or so. Thank you Trident Fitness, LLC and Richard Graham for an awesome product!",1313539200,2,713,4.492307692307692
8473105,5,B005HIK6D6,"I've known about Rich Graham for years. He has always had a reputation as being one of the most intense and physically capable people in the New Jersey area. When I heard he left the Navy Seals to start a fitness company I was excited. He was an excellent personal trainer but I moved across the country. Then Trident Fitness created the Navy SEAL Kettlebell series and I felt like I could have the personal training experience from my own home. This DVD provided me with all the basic info necessary to get strong and fit without hurting myself.

This is not only a great DVD series but a great fitness company you should keep your eye on!",1313452800,,640,4.423728813559322
