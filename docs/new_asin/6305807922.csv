1076922,4,6305807922,"One of Hammer's relatively few sci-fi thrillers, and a sequel to the Quatermass Xperiment, this film is a minor classic of cold chilling paranoia. Adapted by Nigel Kneale from his classic BBC serial, this film  has a basic premise similar to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but taken  into very different directions. Not to give too much away, but the joy of  this film is not in watching the alien plot to take over earth unfold, it's  in watching Professor Quatermass uncover the already widespread conspiracy.  Photographed in beautifully stark monochrome with a great pseudodocumentary  approach, Quatermass 2 is a great example of the sort of sci-fi/horror  hybrid that became popular later with films like Alien and, along with the  other two films in the series and the sadly unavailable The Damned, one of  Hammer's best attempts at science fiction.",951177600,9,857,5.064285714285714

1076996,5,6305807922,Great story line. Special effects are pretty good for a 1950s low budget film. Clever use of a Shell refinery in the UK saved millions pounds for a backdrop. One of my favorite films of this genre. Brian Donlevy is fun as a Indiana Jones like rocket scientist.,1370476800,,260,4.4375
1076997,5,6305807922,"This was the first Quatermass movie/story I seen, and years later, still to this day, I have really fond memories of it. Based on the six-part BBC television serial by Nigel Kneale, and a sequel to ""The Quatermass Xperiment"", ""Quatermass 2 (AKA: Enemy from Space)"" features Professor Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) returning to battle alien invaders. Val Guest returns to the director's seat for this sequel and co-writes the film with Quatermass creator Nigel Kneale.

When a large group of meteorites land in England, some form of alien intelligence is brought with them which starts taking people over, including certain government officials in an attempt to conquer Earth. Now it's up to Professor Quatermass to expose the invaders, destroy the mother creature, and save the world from galactic conquest!

This film inspired the 1967 cult classic ""They Came from Beyond Space"", and also inspired certain ""Doctor Who"" episodes, one particular episode was the highly regarded ""Spearhead from Space"".

This film has got some excellent acting and directing in it. Brian Donlevy plays a more sympathetic and heroic character than he did in the first one. The film is atmospheric, terrifying, and action-packed. Highly recommended!",1365465600,2,1225,5.33678756476684
1076998,5,6305807922,"I expected this to be a fun 50's sci fi film, and it is. It's also extremely well done. The movie's vast alien conspiracy is a precursor to X-Files storylines seen decades later. Brian Donlevy heads a cast all of whom deliver yeoman-like performances. Way-better-than-expected special effects. Anyone who enjoys 1950's-era sci fi movies should definitely check out Quatermass II.",1360540800,,379,5.333333333333333

Having enjoyed the first Quatermass movie (The Creeping Unknown) I was glad to find the sequel. I enjoy the ""brand new technology"", the demonstration of ""new scientific principles"", and the monsters from space. The video quality was excellent: sharp, clear black and white. I am usually generous in my expectations for the overall quality of these dusty old gems, but the engineers have lost control of the soundtrack. It seemed to lag about 1 second behind the action. Other times the dialog was choppy and indistinct, plagued by dropouts. One can follow the action well enough, and I found myself filling in the blanks. That said, this is a great movie and takes its place among the real jewels of the genre. Recommended, yes, but the very sub-par audio may drive you crazy.

1077092,5,6305807922,"I loved The Quatermass Xperiment (Creeping Unknown), and Quatermass and the Pit has always been a favorite of mine, so when I learned there was another Quatermass film that I hadn't yet seen, I just had to buy it.  I was not disappointed; I love this one even more than the Creeping Unknown.

I know there have been many complaints about Brian Donlevy playing Professor Quatermass; I've never understood the reasoning behind them.  I like his performance in both films because he played the professor as a gruff, no nonsense man doggedly pursuing these mysteries to their bitter ends.  In fact, in this film, the story is definitely propelled forward by Donlevy's performance.  He's intense, persistent, and finally desperate because he needs everyone to see what he sees, but they're all stubbornly reluctant until the truth of the situation hits them full force.  I found his performance faultless.  In fact, I can't find much of anything to find fault with in this film.  The cinematography is powerful and bleak with a wonderful use of shadows.  The score by James Bernard is superbly sinister (I wonder if this was where Bernard Herrmann got his inspiration for the Psycho score).  It is nothing less than other worldly.  The story moves along at a brisk pace.  The supporting actors are all great.  I don't even mind that it is a DVD-R product (if that's the only way I can get some of these great old movies, so be it).

This movie definitely goes into my collection.",1327795200,3,1474,4.774703557312253

1077094,4,6305807922,"I bought this dvd because of a vague memory of an ""Early Show"" viewing of Quatermass 2 on a local L.A. tv station sometime in the early 60's. I was mesmerized by ""Quatermass 2"" as a kid, just as I had been by ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"",also first viewed on the same ""Early Show"" (Yeah, yeah,I know,I should have been out playing or doing homework, not watching tv at 4:30 in the afternoon! Maybe I would have learned how to write!).  Both films have similar plots. Although ""Body Snatchers"" was often discussed and easily viewed or purchased over the decades, Quatermass 2, perhaps because it was an English production, seemed, at least to me, difficult to find.  Previous reviews have remarked on what they preceived as the poor quality of this dvd release through Amazon.  The very dark opening scene would be considered by most people, I think, inferior in picture quality to most VHS tapes.  However, after the initial scene, I found the dvd to be highly watchable and on par with the quality of most dvds I have bought over the last 10 years.

Quatermass 2 is entertaining and unusual.  For me, it was worth the price of purchase",1280275200,,1140,4.618811881188119

1077097,1,6305807922,"I was so glad when on a whim one day I noticed that old Hammer horror titles previously released by Anchor Bay Entertainment appeared to be getting a re-release. Boy, was I wrong about that! Don't be fooled. DVD-R's are no substitute for a real factory manufactured product. The pictures appear murky, bleeding and washed out even though its obviously a direct burn from a genuine Anchor Bay DVD. The sound drops in and out. I played each disc on 3 different players manufactured by 3 different companies. In all I wasted $20 dollars a piece on 3 of these pathetic knock offs. Originally when I purchased these titles there was NO mention of them being bootleg quality DVD-R's. I don't know who's ingenious idea it was to propose such a gross misuse of wasted effort. Either shame on Anchor Bay or shame on Amazon for perpetuating such poor quality knock offs at such an absurd price. They even use the original Anchor Bay DVD's cover art printed by a laser printer however most of the special features listed will not appear.

I.E. - The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires does not include the U.S. cut of the film as mentioned.

What a crime in itself either release the film correctly or don't bother at all. What a tease. What a waste of my money and time.

The movie had this been a genuine product released through Anchor Bay would've received 5 stars.

I threw my money away on:

Dracula Prince Of Darkness

Frankenstein Created Woman

The Legend Of The 7 Golden Vampires

Save your money until somebody with half a brain decides to do the right things with the old deleted Hammer titles. I'm still very dissatisfied with this scenario.",1260316800,12,1640,4.592465753424658

1077099,5,6305807922,"I first saw this movie on public television while sick at home.  My mind, high on cough syrup, was hooked by the movie which I watched while in a dark room, sipping orange juice and trying to get some rest.  The feeling that something was going wrong, the slow build up, as fact after fact screamed to Quatermass that he had to act and act now!  The chilling part of the movie was really how realistic the people were - the villagers who don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth, the police and government officials who refuse to do anything without proof, the feeling that time was being wasted while Quatermass begged somebody to notice, anybody, that something was wrong.
A alien invasion story that, while a classic, has not really been remade.
Brian Donlevy seems like a down to Earth Quatermass to me - I have no problem with him.  In fact most of the actors and actresses seem to fit their characters perfectly.
The best part was the fact that after the film ended, and the menu popped up, I found out the film had commentary by the director and writer, with a third, unnamed person, acting as a interviewer.  I am not sure if it was meant for the film or was pieced together from earlier interviews, but it seemed to match what was on the screen and is a wonderful extra.  They also had the American trailer for the film.
All in all a wonderful DVD.  And mine was from Anchor Bay, not some bootleg version on DVD-Rs.",1245196800,7,1428,4.366037735849057

I'm not sure how the licensing for such a DVD-R was worked out with Amazon & Anchor Bay (presumably it was or it would not be for sale on Amazon) but Amazon should not list it like the original Anchor Bay edition which is obviously still out of print and rare.

I used to own the Anchor Bay release of this movie that went Out-Of-Production several years ago and started fetching big bucks on Amazon Marketplace and ""that other auction site"".  As much as I liked the film, I sold original copy for a tidy profit and was hoping this film had been Re-released on DVD when I ordered this.  After receiving it, I found out this was a DVD-R copy of the original.  What that means is it is ""burned"" onto a writable DVD rather than being ""pressed"" or manufactured in a factory.  DVD-Rs are pretty much the same as DVDs, but they don't play in some very old dvd players (1998 and earlier) there is some question as to their longevity.  I sent it back for a refund, so I am not sure if it has the exact same features as the original Anchor Bay disc.  If you are dying to see this movie, this is the only way to legally do it right now, but I think the asking price is too high for a DVD-R.",1238025600,27,1080,4.158653846153846
1077152,4,6305807922,The movie is very good for the most part.  Hammer has expanded on the first Quatermass movie with great results.  It can be a little talky and slow at times but there is always a sinister atmosphere of evil throughout the film.  The ending is very good.,1237507200,,253,4.340425531914893
1077153,5,6305807922,"I first saw this classic Hammer film (1957) when it premiered on US television in the early '60's on New York channel 9's (WOR-TV) ""Million Dollar Movie"". The idea was that the station would play the same film twice an evening (7 and 9 PM) and several times in a row on the week-ends. I happened to catch it early in the week and recall spending the rest of the week watching it over and over again (this was the age of ""you miss the broadcast, you missed it entirely"" television).

Of course, compared to the current age of CGI graphics and action sequences designed specifically to be as spectacular as possible, this 1957 low budget black and white British ""pulp sci fi"" film seems rather tame. But in terms of content, story, tightness in pace and execution it is a stunning example of how a brilliant director (Val Guest) can wring great things out of very limited raw materials.

Personally I would place this as one of my top 10 all time favorite sci fi films. I revisit it at least twice a year (I have the VHS release from long ago), and it never fails to impress and unnerve.

Even the strident performance by Brian Donlevy (best known as a B-Picture villian from the '30's and '40's) adds a sense of urgency to the tone of the picture. The action takes place over three days between the first hint of something not quite right in the little (and currently missing) village of Winerdon Flats, to the explosive conclusion when the alien infestation is defeated. In between the film presents an unrelenting atmosphere that is dark, creepy and rife with paranoia. It gets it's power not from what it shows but from what it implies. Like the American classic ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" there are contemporary political overtones rooted in the ""Red Scare"" of the 1950's, but ""Quatermass II"" does them better and crisper.

Also worth noting is how skillfully director Val Guest is able to infuse a sense of realism through overlapping dialogue and a hint of ""happening right now"" urgency in various scenes.

In general the performances are sharp, real and impelling. If it has a flaw it is that it must bow to its budget limitations for the final reveal of the monster in the final five minutes. You sense that director Guest had to suck it up and muddle through something he knew would never come off the way he might have hoped but was necessary to completing the film.

Even the musical score is startling, consisting of strings and timpani in a combination of ""fingernails on a blackboard"" screech and thunderous, ominous rumbling that gets the viewer in the proper (highly disturbed) mood before the action even begins.

On the whole it is an example of just how brilliant, insightful and disturbing a thing can be created with extremely limited resources and any sci-fi fan will be utterly delighted by this unique experience. Well worth the investment and likely to become a favorite.",1233532800,22,2901,4.676470588235294
1077154,4,6305807922,"Professor Barnard Quatermass (Brian Donlevy of ""Gamera the Invincible"") returns in ""Quatermass 2,"" the sequel to Hammer Production's ""The Quatermass Xperiment.""  This classic science fiction horror masterpiece is as excellent, if not superior, as the original.  Professor Quatermass appears to have mellowed since we first met him; he displays more compassion towards his fellow man.

  Professor Quatermass learns that meteorites of uniform size and shape are falling at regular intervals and landing in a particular site.  Upon further investigation, he learns the landing site is near a top secret government facility that contains huge domes.  He is told that synthetic food is stored in these domes?  Synthetic food for whom . . . or what?  The true nature of this facility is being kept a secret by a government conspiracy involving officials at high levels.

  There is plenty of action in this movie.  An angry mob of townspeople descend upon the facility and fight the guards who are nicknamed ""zombies.""  It reminded me of a gothic horror film when the villagers attack a castle suspected of harboring a vampire.  Many people are shot and killed.  This film is similar to the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" because humans are possessed by aliens and forced to protect the colony that has established itself at the facility.

  If only ""Quatermass 2"" could've been filmed in color.  The wounds on people's faces and arms would've appeared more grotesque.  They were adequately described in detail but there is no substitute for living color.  Too bad we learn so little of the creatures.  Where exactly do they come from and why did they choose earth to colonize?

  Some critics say ""Quatermass 2"" is the best of the Quatermass trilogy.  I disagree.  I think all three films are equally wonderful.  Each one deals with alien colonization and should be watched in the order in which they were released.  ""Quatermass 2"" is a must have for fans of science fiction horror and fans of Hammer Production.",1220400000,,2010,5.0212765957446805
1077155,5,6305807922,"Definitely one of my personal sci-fi favorites.  Strong supporting cast.  Well written and directed.  I highly recommend this film. If you can't afford the more expensive dvd version, then, by all means, purchase a vhs copy.  You won't be disappointed.",1218844800,,252,5.225
1077156,4,6305807922,"Following on their success with The Quatermass Xperiment, Hammer quickly bought the film rights to its BBC sequel. Bringing back many of the same creative team who made the first film so successful and allowing original writer Nigel Kneale to co-write the script, Quatermass 2 had a lot to live up to.

Like its predecessor, Quatermass 2 has a strong cast. Brian Donlevy returns as Professor Bernard Quatermass. Quatermass is the archetype science fiction film scientist: a scientist obsessed with their quest for science before turning having to deal with the consequences of that quest. In this film Quatermass goes from disappointment in the government's refusal to back his Moon Project (this was more then a decade before Apollo 11 mind you) to intrigued by a continuous fall of meteorites to the last hope against an extraterrestrial invasion. The nature of the story means that Donlevy (and Quatermass) are caught in the effects of the story rather then the cause of it, this films till has a good performance from Donlevy.  There are many new faces including John Longden who takes over from jack Warner as Lomax, filling in very nicely and there's Sydney James who practically steals any scene he's in as reporter Jimmy Hall in one of the film's best performances. Then there's the storing supporting cast including Bryan Forbes as Marsh, John Van Eyssen as the sinister public relations man at the facility, and then there's Tom Chatto as Vincent Broadhead, the government official looking for the truth behind the mysterious facility. Chatto isn't on screen for long but he has a chilling exit that marks what is perhaps the film's best moment.

Quatermass 2 does what it predecessor did so well: it rose above a genre that was at the time defined by the clichd and outrageous monster and alien invasion films. This film is far from clich thanks to some excellent dialogue and plotting by Kneale and co-writer / director Val Guest. Yet on top of that there is something unnerving about watching this film. Nigel Kneale played into Cold War fears and secrecy to create a story about what happens when the need for secrecy is circumvented to cover up someone else's sinister agenda. True it's done in a science fiction context that seems far removed from then let alone today more then fifty years later, but it is still a powerful message and the overriding theme of the film.

The film is also helped immensely by two of the strongest elements of The Quatermass Xperiment: the black and white cinematography and the music score. The black and white cinematography adds atmosphere and realism to a film that begins as an investigation into meteorite showers and turns into a race against an invasion from creatures from one of the moons of Saturn. It helps also that the locations for the facility are as dark and foreboding as the script called for which adds even more tension and realism to the film. . The music score by James Bernard is terrific in adding to the atmosphere of the film and it never intrudes, but just helps to bring one a little bit closer to the edge of one's seat. There seems to be a lot less music in this film then there was in Quatermass Xperiment, which might be good or bad but I have a hard time telling which. Either way, Quatermass 2 wouldn't be the same or really even as good either one of these two elements.

The biggest fault of the film is what is the biggest fault if films of the era: the special effects. While one could look past this fault in Quatermass Xperiment it is impossible to overlook here. The special effects in this film are totally unconvincing I am sorry to say. This is a shame because not only does it bring down the film in terms of comparison with its predecessor but nearly makes void all the realism placed by all the other elements of the film. Thankfully this major downside is made a lot less catastrophic by better elements of the production.

Yet outside of the special effects, there is much to like about this film. It has a strong cast, a script that contains both good plotting and dialogue eon top of delving into the heart of the issue of government secrecy, excellent black and white cinematography and a highly atmospheric score from James Bernard. In short, Quatermass 2 is just as tense, realistic, and gritty as it predecessor and well-worth seeing.",1218240000,,4338,4.723910171730515

1077158,5,6305807922,"The gothic horror films of Hammer generally trod a well worn route, with rules and conventions laid down not only by 19th century literature, but also by Hammer themselves. As a result a great number of these films now seem formulaic and unadventurous. The period directly proceeding THE CURSE OF FRANKENSTEIN in hindsight now seems one of the most interesting in Hammer's history. The period 1955-7, produced three films that although owing a great deal too gothic conventions are more ostensibly science-fiction. The three films THE QUATERMASS XPERIMENT, X THE UNKNOWN and QUATERMASS 2, are far richer and rewarding than their colour contemporaries. The latter film also has a viable claim to being Hammer's greatest film. Nigel Kneale's distrust of government and its various institutional strands reaches its apex here. Whereas the first Quatermass film had an alien intelligence inside a human being, in the sequel the alien intelligence is already here and has with unrealistic ease infiltrated the highest reaches of British government. The film also gets to grips with industrialisation, military brute force and working class uprisings. A lot of substance and weighty issues cultural issues of the day are explored. With its military law, the area surrounding the synthetic food factory (really a processing plant to feed the alien infiltrators) has the feel of a fascist state. There are a number of layers to this film which reward repeated views. But the most interesting is the use and rejection of the working classes, whose only useful purpose to the alien invaders is to block up the pipes to stop lethal oxygen entering their domes. Once again Val Guest creates some impressive tension which is aided by the monochrome look. QUATERMASS 2 is a film that proves that British Science Fiction can uniquely speak to the culture of Britain and work as a fine example of the genre, for me this film remains Hammer's finest achievement.",1156809600,3,1945,5.119496855345912
1077223,4,6305807922,"This is a fantastic movie full of atmosphere and some real food for thought. In fact, it is extremely well done all around. The acting in particular by Brian Donlevy as Quatermass is very realistic and convincing. I particularly liked the mood setting cinematography by Gerald Gibbs and James Bernard's score. It goes without saying that the script by director Val Guest succeeded on many levels making it engaging to a wide audience. I found this film to be both entertaining and thought provoking. Val Guest really knows how to set the mood.",1149033600,2,543,4.849462365591398

1077226,5,6305807922,"Thanks to an excellent literate script by master Nigel Kneale and intensive, atmospheric direction by the underrated Val Guest (who both scored great marks with ""Abominable Snowman""), this ranks as one of the best and most disturbing Science-Fiction Thrillers.  I don't need to reiterate the intriguing story, but it builds gripping suspense from the word 'Go' and finally  escalates into a crucial state-of-alarm that climaxes in a thrilling and terrifying showdown at the secret alien refinary plant in the remote British country.  Pretty violent and grim for its time, and it still retains its entertaining and thought-provoking qualities.  The confrontation between the workers and the alien-controlled government & military ""zombies"" has certain Marxist underlying themes of the 'workers revolt againest the oppressive, dictatorial rulers' - who, in shattering fact, are aliens who are truly alien - and thoroughly malevolent.  Some kaffka allegories of corrupt government and fascism are conveyed here in the bleakest of ways. Kneale's intelligent, riveting screenplay also served as the basis for the James Bond plots and wild devices that surfaced a few years later in the rebelliously turbulent 6O's - which this insightfully compelling Science-Fiction Classic seems to sinisterly forecast.  Not your typical or campy monster movie by any long shots.  Also, quite cynical for its time, as Quatermass is forced to become the angst-ridden, alienated hero (anti-hero) in his accidental uncovering of conspiracy (his plans for a proposed moon project is swiped by them) and cover-ups:  Very Hitchcockian.  Also sounds a lot like X-FILES, doesn't it? I believe this was XF's producers favorite childhood science-fiction film; the dark, ominous influence and inspiration is undoubtably present.  Not a kid's flick by any means.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hauntingly memorable and intensely scary classic.  Probably the most starkly realistic vision of what a true alien invasion  might be like.  Genuine nightmares to take to bed - and wonder.",1046736000,4,2044,5.530546623794212
1077227,4,6305807922,"As others have pointed out, this is a fantastic movie. It's one of my all-time favorites, so when the DVD edition came out I had to have it. Unfortunately, it is rather disappointing. To begin with, the video quality of the opening 2 minutes and a few other dimly lit scenes come off very badly on the DVD; this is even acknowledged in a little notice included with the disc. Too bad, they should have just dubbed it from the VHS edition, which looks fine!
The added attractions of the DVD edition are a 25 minute documentary on Hammer Films Sci-Fi films and a running commentary by Nigel Kneale and Val Guest. There's also a theatrical trailer, but that's on the VHS tape too.
Well, it's too bad they waited so long to interview Guest and Kneale, because they have very few recollections of the film. Oh there's a fact or two here and there, but it's basically rather dull. Kneale still harps on how much he dislikes Brian Donlevy as Quatermass, even though it's been 45 years since the movie was made! Guest is a little more interesting, when he speaks. Overall I think they'd have done better to have a fan of the film or a movie historian do the voice over.
The Hammer Film documentary is just 25 minutes of film clips with some narration. Again, not impressive.
Overall, I'd have to say this DVD is below average. I guess I'll be keeping my VHS tape.",1044662400,7,1355,4.445783132530121
1077228,4,6305807922,"With exception made for the films of George Pal and Andrei Tarkovsky, science fiction cinema appeals to me mostly in black-and-white. Cameron Menzies' Things to Come (1936), for example, would look gaudy and toy-like had it been filmed in one of the color processes; but in black-and-white, the war scenes acquire a documentary grittiness (which Menzies certainly meant them to have) and the miniature work looks grand and convincing. Byron Haskin originally planned to shoot his big-bug flick Them! (1954) in color and 3-D, but finally made it on a lower budget in desert- and storm-drain-friendly black-and-white. The nightmarish-ness of Don Siegel's Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) is drained away in the two remakes from the late 1970s and early 1990s; Siegel's own vision puts Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter in a labyrinth of threatening shadows where the merest hint of color would spoil the creepy mood. Director Val Guest's Quatermass II (1958), known in its original American release as The Enemy from Space, has a number of points of contact with The Body Snatchers, and is equally effective in conjuring an atmosphere of occult paranoia over a contagious loss of humanity. Brian Donlevy reprises the character of Professor Bernard Quatermass, head of the British ""Rocket Program"" and scientific jack-of-all-trades. In the first Quatermass film, The Creeping Unknown (1952), the redoubtable professor battles a gelatinous carnivore that started its human meal by devouring a crew of astronauts pioneering the way into earth orbit. The nemesis in Quatermass II is more diffuse, more intelligent, and potentially far more deadly. It is a collective intelligence able to possess human hosts and coerce them into service. These ""zombies,"" as the film calls them, have taken over a remote government facility and are systematically dispossessing the bodies of government officials, whom they lure into the place in the pretence that it is a ""synthetic food factory"" about to make agriculture obsolete. Quatermass discovers the place when he goes looking for a meteor-fall detected by radar from his rocket test range. He finds that someone has built, on the site of a demolished village, the ""moon base"" for which he has just conspicuously failed to get funding. Sinister looking guards appear and take away the professor's aid, who has received a characteristic v-shaped wound from a meteor that he has picked up from the ground. The things crack apart when held. A dark blotch appears on the neck or face of the victim. All the guards show the same lesion. After considerable frustration and a hair's breadth escape from the conversion process, Quatermass penetrates to the truth behind all the skullduggery: aliens are indeed invading the earth, taking over humanity, and growing huge masses of parasite-creatures in the pressure-domes. Guest's direction is stark: he filmed many scenes at a Shell Oil refinery on the Welsh coast and he skillfully inter-cuts location footage with one or two matte-shots, a couple of miniature sets, and some studio interiors. The ""alien base"" looks steely and inhuman; the parasite-ridden hosts behave in convincingly dehumanized ways and are efficiently monomaniacal. There is no bravado from the players. The superb editing packs much incident into eighty minutes. In one horrific scene, an investigating parliamentarian falls into a vat of alien ""food"" and is covered head to foot with corrosive slime. All of the Quatermass films are intelligent and Quatermass II is no exception. The musical score contributes a good deal to the atmosphere. Recommended for aficionados of Cold War sci-fi for the silver screen or for fans of The Body Snatchers who are curious about that film's less well known British counterpart.",1039564800,12,3767,5.259136212624584
1077229,4,6305807922,"Well I remember the afternoon I sat as a ten year old, glued to the TV, mesmerized by fear, as this creepy story unfolded!! I can only add my two cents' worth to the above excellent reviews of this 1957 (and wasn't THAT a great year for SF movies?) gem: (1) The score by James ""The Devil Rides Out"" Bernard. I think a CD is available of some of his film music, including ""Q2""....Wonder if ol' Bernard Hermann saw this movie before he scored ""sycho""? (2) The ""...H U M A N  P U L P !!"" scene towards the end in the control room. O that the modern movies left more to the imagination!!",1033257600,,583,4.069565217391304
1077230,4,6305807922,"British government rocket scientist Bernard Quatermass is busy at work on his second major space project, when a micrometeorite swarm in the country catches his attention.  The objects recovered don't appear to be meterorites, but rather something small, metallic and hollow.  When handled, they explode, emitting an unknown gas and leaving a distinctive mark on whoever disturbs them.
Afterward, those exposed behave differently than before.  They're still the person they were, but they engage in projects with others who have been similarly affected, chief of which is an isolated government high-security series of domes whose purpose is unknown.  Quatermass is more surprised than most, because the domes are a replica of his own project  -  which is barely off the drawing boards, and not known by anyone.
Attempts to discover what the government is about are fruitless, and Quatermass is blocked from further inquiry  -  by ministers bearing the mark of the non-meteorites.  He gathers a few people he can trust to investigate the mysterious goings-on, and discovers a most unusual form of alien invasion in progress...
This is great sci-fi, scripted by Nigel Kneale, one of the best names in the business.  Val Guest's direction is atmospheric and suspenseful, transforming an otherwise somewhat hackneyed plot (though elevated by Kneale's distinctive hand) into a top-notch action-melodrama.  The dramatic revelations, when they finally come, are genuinely scary and very effective.  There are some truly frightening moments, such as one in which a government minister stumbles onto something sinister in the mysterious plant, and returns nearly burned to a crisp, clothes and skin still smoking.  What's actually in the domes is very, very creepy.
The film isn't perfect, but it's quite good.  Brian Donlevy never was a good casting choice for Professor Quatermass, though he handles the role ably enough.  Britain was at the mercy of American film companies for a good while after WWII, and the only way the UK could get many of its films released was with the inclusion of American actors.  It's no insult to Donlevy, it's just that the character is very British, and he is not.
Well worth watching.  Preceded by The Creeping Unknown (a.k.a. The Quatermass Experiment), and followed by the excellent Five Million Years to Earth (a.k.a. Quatermass and the Pit)  -  and many years later by the more disappointing The Quatermass Conclusion.",1022457600,,2449,5.249357326478149
1077231,4,6305807922,"First of all, if you've never seen a Quatermass film before, the name is pronounced KWAY-ter-mass. The three Quatermass films by Hammer are all adapted from British television serials in the 1950s; a fourth Quatermass series was televised in 1979. The general consensus is that of the Hammer films, _Quatermass 2_ is the best, and I have to agree. (As the British television versions go, I've heard several different opinions as to which Quatermass is the best, from the 1958 _Quatermass and the Pit_ to 1979's _Quatermass_.  The stories of these television serials are much too complicated for an average 90-minute B picture.)
The screenplay for _Quatermass 2_ is a marvel of efficiency, setting up characters and situations with remarkable ease and confidence. Unlike other films in the series, this one doesn't seem burdened with too much exposition. Perhaps this is because most of us have already seen this story in a different form, as _Invasion of the Body Snatchers_. (The televised version of _Quatermass 2_ actually preceded _Invasion_ by a year or two.) But _Q2_ has a very different focus, articulating Britain's paranoia over a military-industrial complex that seems out of control. Sound familiar?
Although the script is quite good, it's the superb direction of Val Guest that really makes the film work. He makes it easy for viewers to keep track of a complex chains of events, often pulling suspenseful moments seemingly from thin air. Brian Donleavy's square-jawed, straight-arrow performance as Professor Quatermass is perhaps a little too much like Joe Friday for my taste. Still, I frequently enjoyed Donleavy's overbearing manner, even though it's the only aspect of the film that feels dated now.
One of the best and brainiest sci-fi films from the '50s ... well worth owning if you're a sci-fi fan, and well worth viewing if you're not. (By the way, the central ideas of John Carpenter's recent _Ghosts of Mars_ seem somewhat indebted to _Q2_, although _Q2_ is by far the better film.)",1015718400,15,2008,5.084848484848485
1077232,5,6305807922,"I first saw ""Quatermas II"" (it's original Hammer release title) almost 40 years ago and even today it maintains much of its original power and impact. The combination of talents (Nigel Kneale's script, Val Guest directing, even the high, tense string musical score blend together to make this a true classic, regardless of the fact that it was done on a pittance of a budget.
Val Guest's direction is almost flawless, blending overlapping dialogue and camerawork designed to draw the viewer into the moment by allowing them to observe from a ""non-God"" viewpoint, rather than throw the action into the face (as is common in most films today.) One example of this would be a scene, early on, when Quatermass and his assistant travel to a remote English village to investigate a report of strange goings-on at a secret plant of some kind. They drive down a clean, modern road that ends abruptly in the middle of nowhere. Confused and a bit unnerved we stand beside them on the road, watching them climb back into their car and pull away. A few moments later, distant, shadowy figures step out of the forest, stopping to watch them depart. It is the fact that we do not know who or even what these individuals are and are not drawn into a close-up of them that makes the moment especially unnerving and creepy. The entire film is rife with such suggestive, effective touches.
The dialogue, while witty and crisp, is still to the point and drives the story along in a sudden rush. The entire tale takes place over the space of only a few days, but the distance travelled is lightyears in terms of mood and power.
Even the musical score, a combination of rolling, threatening timpini and screeching violins, merely heightens the already anxious mood of the story.
The performances are competent, in come cases journeyman in caliber, but the real power of the piece is the barely suppressed hint of menace that flows through it, like a half formed nightmare.
If there is a flaw in the film it is one of budgetary constraints, particularly in the eventual appearance of ""the monster"" at the very end of the film. Even with modern special effects it is difficult to imagine that moment carried out with complete success, though it is clearly expected by the viewer to be presented eventually. But the scenes leading up to it drive ahead into a chasm of disturbing images that are difficult to ignore. (The scenes of the heros trapped in the control room at the plant alone are a tidal wave of paranoia, claustrophobia and horror without ever having to resort to trickery or special effects.)
By all means every student of film or science fiction fan should at least see this picture. And it is well worth adding to a collection. I view it at least annually.",1013126400,25,2748,4.691511387163561
1077290,4,6305807922,"This movie reminded me a lot of Soylent Green, which is about a food factory that uses suspicious ingredients.  This movie is actually about a rocket scientist, Quatermass, who comes upon an exact replica of his moon base in rural England.  It turns out to be a special project where they make artificial food -- or do they?
Quatermass is really a big jerk.  He is very rude, cuts people off, and doesn't listen to much that they have to say.  Of course everybody respects him for this!  I wouldn't have minded seeing Quatermass get slapped around a bit.
Anyway, this is a pretty good sci fi/horror movie from the 50's.  The setting (large industrial plant in the middle of nowhere during WWII -- which explains a lot of the secrecy) and the fact that it is B&W makes it particularly creepy.  The video quality is surprisingly good, better than most cheeseball movies from the 70's and 80's!

The atmosphere of suspence in this film is beyond belief, as aliens from an orbiting asteroid orbit the dark side of the earth, sending projectiles to the earth, which on contact with human life infect an individual, and possess thier minds, so that the aliens can manifest themselves in a replica of Professor Quatermass' Moon Project, which basically looks like an oil refinery with an addage of huge pressure domes, which harbour the alien organisms as they are collected by armed guards who protect the base. 'Quatermass 2' location actually was an oil refinery, SHELL to be precise at Coryton in Essex, sometimes refered to as SHELLHAVEN.

1077294,4,6305807922,"Quatermass 2 (pronounced like equator and not quarter) is utterly  flawless.  This DVD B/W film is superbly vibrant and crisp. The dialogue  however seems to drown on occassion while conversely the accent music will  send you seeking a lower setting on the volume control.  This was one of  the scariest movies I can remember from my youth when it was titled  ""Enemy from Space"", and believe it or not, it still maintains  some of its punch.
The movie starts with Quatermass avoiding a car  accident with a young couple, one of which is delirious with a strange  V-shaped blister on his face.  Quatermass, averting the accident, lends his  assistance.  In trying to ascertain the delirium of the man, the women  tells Quatermass they heard ""falling"" sounds.  She gives him a  medium size rock she says her friend was investigating when it exploded in  his face.  The name of a town where the blister was received is  mentioned.
Quatermass is a rocket scientist with a government  grant-supported research facility to build a rocket to colonize other  planets.  Unfortunately he has chosen nuclear propulsion to power the  untested rocket.  The idea of a mishap during launch or recovery has caused  the government to withdraw support of his project.
Upon his return to his  facility, Quatermass notices that his radar dish is pointed abnormally low  to the ground.  Quatermass indignantly chastises his top two scientists for  the low radar dish and gives them the broken rock from the accident for  classification.  The scientist do not get to explain that have been  tracking a continuous cascade of objects to the earth about 90 mile away.  Quatermass, realizing his anger is over his concerned for the lack of  funding for the project apologizes and moans over a 3D model of a  colonization facility envisioned for the moon.  The fellow scientist are  informed of the lack of future funding as Quatermass leaves to confer with  his nuclear engineers at the nearby launch pad.
The next day, when  Quatermass returns, another scientist questions him about the rock.  He  tells him he cannot classify it and that it is cylindrical in shape both  inside and out.  When asked where he got it from, they are informed of  Quatermass' near accident.  When the name of the town is mentioned the  scientists realize that this is the approximate landing location of the  tracked falling objects.  They check a map and Quatermass and one of the  scientist travel to the area the next day.
Upon arrival at the area the  road forks into two directions.  The fork to the map-indicated town is  government-posted as NO ENTRY so they take the other fork which leads to an  abrupt end of the concrete roadway.  Getting out of the car, Quatermass  warns his young assistant not to walk beyond the concrete for fear of  government placed security mines.  They get back into the car and to go  back to the other fork.  As they leave the scene, in the distance, armed  uniformed personnel wearing gas masks emerge from the surrounding foilage.
Disregarding the government postings, they take the other fork.  On a  high ridge, Quatermass gasps.  His assistant peers through Quatermass'  window and says ""Oh no!"".  In the distance is a fully functional  replica of their 3D moon colonization facility, two miles square,  surrounded by security fencing with three overpowering pressurized domes  about 200 feet high.  They get out seeing ruins they surmise must be the  missing town.  They also discover small rocks like the one given Quatermass  scattered all over the hillside.  Some of the ""rocks"" are old,  some recent and all broken except one buried in the ground. The assistant  digs it up as Quatermass protests to ""leave it alone"".....In the  distance the loud echo of a siren begins
Its not my intention to narrate  the complete story but as you can see, the plot compounds marvelously.  The  backgrounds are time-neutral, even the characters suits are even back in  style.  Vehicles are vintage and could be considered old, but current.  Scenes (in London particularly) are somewhat devoid of anachronisms so much  that if this film were colorized you could almost imagine a CG team  cleaning up those period giveaways and updating this original film.

In this film, Quatermass  inadvertantly stumbles across a secret military base whose staff will shoot  first and ask questions later. (Shades of Area 51!) Unfortunately, the  secret of this base is *far* worse than reverse-engineering, and the safety  of the world is (again) in Quatermass's hands.
It's too bad that Brian  Donlevy really makes a poor Quatermass, but he's all we have. He seems to  confuse bullying and shouting with projecting authority and confidence, and  you end up somewhat surprised no one decks him. Andrew Keir (Quatermass and  the Pit) presents a much more palatable Quatermass interpretation.
That  said, though, I really give this a very high recommendation.

7895166,4,6305807922,"Bringing back Brian Donlevy to the central role after THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT (1955), QUATERMASS 2 tells another familiar tale of the earth being threatened by aliens, who infect human beings and transform them into zombies.

A familiar tale, no doubt, but Val Guest's film possesses a documentary realism by being filmed in and around the Shell refinery in Essex, southern England - a futuristic-looking structure of pipes, domes and other mechanical hardware. Such location work invests the story with a chilling realism, making it seem as if the civilized world could really be subject to invasion, both physical as well as mental.

As in all good science-fiction movies, the story begins mundanely enough, with the tension increasing until the violent climax, with a machine-gun battle that leaves the refinery strewn with corpses. It is chiefly due to Quatermass's persistence that the plan is brought to light; like all good scientists he refuses to accept the British government's attempts to whitewash the situation and seeks after truth, even at the risk of his own life. With his trilby hat at an angle and dirty mackintosh, he cuts a determined figure, in contrast to the mealy-mouthed public relations officer for the plant (John Van Eyssen).

The film has some memorable cameos, from Sidney James's investigative reporter (with an inexplicable American accent), to Vera Day's brassy barmaid - doing a jig that is quite risqu for a mid-Fifties British film, and William Franklyn's stoical scientist, determined to carry out Quatermass's orders, even if they seem rather preposterous.

The climax is a good one, with the special effects extremely plausibly employed. Although Quatermass emerges triumphant, in cahoots with reliable police inspector Lomax (John Longdon), they are both aware that the threat of invasion has only been blunted, not eradicated. This inconclusive ending opens the door for further sequels (another Quatermass film appeared a decade later) while suggesting that while this particular battle has been won, the Cold War continues unresolved.",1450483200,,2080,5.371165644171779
7895167,5,6305807922,"One of the very best Sci-Fi films ever made. Also known as ""Enemy from Space"". I love Brian Donlevy as Professor Quatermass. He is always in a hurry. People talking at a normal pace are too slow for him.  Hurry up, man, Earth is in danger. No time for bureaucratic snafus. Something has to be done right now. I wish we had him shaking up our current congress, with it's anti scientific nonsense.
Contrary to comments from other reviewers I must say that this is an Anchor Bay DVD. Very good quality!",1447804800,,499,4.423913043478261

7895171,5,6305807922,"This movie scared the daylights out of me when I first saw it at about eight years old (nightmares for days afterwards), and I've never forgotten it.  Not quite as impactful the second time around (perhaps forty years later), but still tense and scary -- it stands up well to my childhood memories.  Very much of its time, but a classic among '50s sci-fi thrillers.",1423008000,,365,4.6
7895172,5,6305807922,"Excellent cinematography; excellent acting; excellent production; very interesting plot.
Much better than its predecessor, The Quatermass Xperiment, this is a well-done, well-thought out story.
Released in the USA as Enemy From Space.",1416096000,,234,6.34375
7895173,5,6305807922,"This is an exciting movie.  It's packed with chills and scares.  It moves fast.  So fast that you can't imagine what's going to happen next.  But it's much more than just a great movie.  It tells a story which is all too familiar today, more than 50 years on from when this movie was made - the story of what happens when gullible people believe the lies of a regime which, while declaring it wants to help mankind, is really bent on its total destruction.  That regime could be anything which fits that description for you. For me, I often imagine it to be the modern medical industry with its own agenda, inextricably intertwined with the universities and drug companies, while practising cruel and barbaric ""treatments"" on patients who mistakenly think they're going to be cured, so that I often refer to the industry as ""the domes"".  But back to the movie. When one of the locals is ""infected"", and a reporter is murdered, they realize they've been duped.  And you'll appreciate it when they bravely take a stand against the ""guards"" who operate the domes, all armed to the teeth with machine guns, with lines like: ""The filthy, murdering swine - they're gonna get it tonight!""  ""Get the management - I want to speak to the management""!
Near the end of the film, one of Quatermass' team - a rocket scientist with obvious kindness and compassion - sacrifices his life to save the whole of humanity.  It is a stunning moment.
In sum, it's a very entertaining movie with a very powerful message.",1414800000,,1496,4.632575757575758
