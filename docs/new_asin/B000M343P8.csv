8166109,1,B000M343P8,"This dvd never had julie strain or monique gabrille together. i have seen the commercial and i thought it could be hot,
I'm guessing that who ever pressed it, pressed the wrong original.",1381449600,,186,4.666666666666667
8166110,1,B000M343P8,"What a monumental waste of money. Just soft, soft, soft vignettes, no story, no nothing really. And running in at like a whopping 45 minutes ( or less , though it seemed interminably longer ).

I bought this for Ms Gabrielle - an all time favorite. Even she can't breathe live into this dead celluloid turkey.

After less than one cursor viewing, I threw this DVD in the garbage.

Avoid.",1172448000,18,387,4.5
