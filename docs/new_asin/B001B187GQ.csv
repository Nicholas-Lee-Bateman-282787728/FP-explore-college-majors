8281191,4,B001B187GQ,"Director Franco Prosperi's 'THE LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH' aka  'TERROR' aka 'LA SETTIMA DONNA'- 1978 has been given a bum rap over the years.  Released after the success of Director Wes Craven's 'LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT'-1972, Euro cinema went on the copy cat band wagon with some stylish but violently strong thrillers such as Director Aldo Lado's 'NIGHT TRAIN MURDERS' aka""L' ULTIMO TRENO DELLA NOTTE-1975  and Director Mier Zarchi's 'I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE'-1978 embracing the strong female as vigilante motif.  Prosperi's film does one better as having a mother superior doubting her vows after the rape and carnage perpetrated by four bandits who invade her cloistered world by the sea and decides to take control of the situation.  The film has excellent acting by Euro stalwarts Florinda Bolkan and Ray Lovelock who both graced many genres and worked with excellent directors such as Lucio Fulci, Umberrto Lenzi, and Ruggiero Deodato.  Yes, it has scenes of rape and violence but Prosperi was no hack having written screenplays for a least three works by Director Mario Bava.  The technique shows in the great set pieces throughout the film , it's masterful photography by Cristiano Progeny and Seventies progressive score by Roberto Pregadio (utilizing the incredible voice of Ennio Morricone alumnus Edda Del Orso) elevating this thriller above the sleaze market for which it probably was embraced by, however, the slomo rape by stick sequence is pretty strong stuff.  The conclusion of the film resembles and probably inspired Director Quentin Tarantino's 'DEATH PROOF'-2007 as the leader gets his just comeuppance by the women in the retreat.  Director Ruggiero Deodato would have the final say on this type of film with his grim photoplay 'THE HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK' aka 'LA CASA SPERDUTA NEL PARCO- 1980.  Severin Films releases it in their usual expert fashion, English dubbed in a nice 2.35 wide screen transfer  with a featurette 'HOLY BEAUTY VS. THE EVIL BEASTS' with reminiscences by actor Ray Lovelock who looks great for his age and Italian and German Theatrical Trailers to the film.  I had this on my discs to watch pile for a while and I'm glad I popped it in my player.  For fans of Euro exploitation thrillers, it doesn't get any better than this.",1391385600,2,2276,4.957894736842105

The rape-revenge grindhouse template was pretty firmly established by 1978, when LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH was release. That same year saw one of the subgenres definitive examples, Day of the Woman (aka I Spit on Your Grave). Both BEACH and DAY post-dated by several years the Wes Craven classic Last House on the Left, whose title BEACH is most obviously wearing coattails upon which it rides with pride. Left hit theaters in 72 and can be fairly declared the seminal rape-revenge film. The template lent itself to variant usages of the same general skeleton plot. Sometimes the rape-revenge pic was a rape/murder (murder of the rape victim, that is)-revenge pic, as with Left. Or just a rape-revenge flick like Day/Spit. It goes without saying the revenge includes murder, but murder against the tormenters. Hence, the revenge. BEACH offers both. The group of women on holiday, accompanied by a nun  yes, this one even squeezes in some nunsploitation  have different fates. Some survive, but not all. The nun component is exploited both via sexual humiliation of the character and her ironically being the initiator of the vengeance (you just knew that was going to happen). There is a scene in which she removes her cross before taking  extreme measures to resolve the hideous hostage situation. It reminds me much of the classic trope of the cop who puts his badge away because tonight  hes not a cop. Cant you just see Danny Glover shoving his badge in his desk drawer? At any rate, while LAST HOUSE ON THE BEACH is a slow build, it possesses bursts of incredible stylishness, moments of fiendishness and an animalistic denouement. Its a worthy member of the vintage grindhouse rape-revenge subgenre.",1362268800,2,1725,5.0
8281193,3,B001B187GQ,"Marketed as an Italian 'Last House On The Left' (not exactly a publicity perk by today's standards, but the original was highly influential back in the day), this sea-side version of a similar tale was rather disappointing. I'm a fan of Florinda Balkin ('Lizard in a Woman's Skin', 'Flavia the Heretic', 'Investigation Of A Citizen Above Suspicion', etc.), who's a very good actress but, as time went on, appeared in cinematic vehicles that got weaker, never showing off her true capabilities adequately, so I had higher hopes for this film she lent her name to.

Unfortunately, the poor dubbing used for most of the characters voices, especially the villains, only served to magnify the movie's weaknesses, and Severin dropped the ball on us here, although they usually come through for their fanbase on most of their releases. I must single out one of the villain's wretched overacting so much so that I almost shut the flick off more than once, but my high tolerance for Eurotrash coupled with my hopes for a decent finale made me stick it out - not necessarily a good decision in this case.

There were several times that it picked up pace and headed into territory that looked promising, but immediately petered out and flat lined again. Not even a defibrillator could restore its pulse. It lacked everywhere and needed more of everything (remember, we're referring to a slice of Exploitation here that's got a boatload of hype behind its sails) - more ultra-violence, more brutality, more nudity, more tension and suspense.

All in all, it was disappointing, but it wasn't horrible, for fans it's worthy of a rental, but not a cornerstone in a collection by any means. After viewing, it's my last time for 'Last House'...",1281657600,3,1727,4.887372013651877
8281194,2,B001B187GQ,"Ok Ok, I'm a big fan of euro sleave movies and I bought and watched it last night.  I read the reviews and thought it would be something a bit more on the violent side with lots of nudity and sleazy sex.  I was upset with it.  The violence is not that graphic, most of the sheer terror these girls endure happens off camera.  There isn't much in the line of nudity either.  Yes - there is a some T & A, but not as much as you would expect or want from 70's euro sleaze.  Good points - I love the music, and shot selection.  The locations are awesome and it was shot very nicely.  I liked the use of the slow-mo for the first major rape scene.  I highly enjoyed the facial expressions of the rapists.  Some of the looks these guys gave are plain hilarious.  It is worth a look, buy it and then sell it later.  I can see this disk going OOP within 6 months and then being worth a few bucks within a couple of years.  That is what I'm planning to do with it.  Check it out - don't expect much in the line of violence and nudity.  Sit back, enjoy the artsy camera work, and awesome music.  BTW- most of the girls are pretty cute and the one that I wanted to see naked never did.  :(",1227398400,10,1178,3.9446808510638296
8281195,4,B001B187GQ,"This is a first-rate thriller - a cut above the usual fare of the era. Definitely not a rip-off of Wes Craven's film, this has a flavor all its own. Considering the rarity of this title its a no-brainer to pick up it and add it to your collection",1224806400,4,246,4.040816326530612
