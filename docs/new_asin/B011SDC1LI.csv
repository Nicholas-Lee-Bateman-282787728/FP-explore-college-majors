7341017,5,B011SDC1LI,"If you are even the slightest bit a David Lynch fan, Mulholland Dr. has to be considered the top of the pyramid.  Every scene is fascinating.  Not one frame of film exists without good reason.  This is the product of a master filmmaker at the top of his game.  It is film noir, it is a daydream, a nightmare, a drug trip and a wet dream.  The story is complex and broken into delicious little pieces, asking the viewer to become a detective observing clues and making sense of it all.  But in true Lynch fashion, the movie always goes to unexpected and unpredictable places.  You may feel out of breath from struggling to keep up with a movie that doesn't slow down to insult your intelligence with wordy exposition.  This is a demanding experience.  The director expects you to pay attention, expects you to notice and remember details and expects that you have the brain power to piece it all together.",1441670400,46,904,4.530864197530864

7341020,5,B011SDC1LI,"A beautifully surreal modern masterpiece - widely regarded to be one of the best films of the 2000's. While Twin Peaks may be director David Lynch's legacy and magnum opus, Mulholland Dr. may be his most fully realised work. An essential for fans of Lynch, with many trademarks of his unique style in his later works in this film. This is another great example of surrealism (nearly experimental) in cinema. A glossy, dreamy Hollywood puzzle pieced together by brilliant symbolism and emotional clues, demands multiple viewings. Superb in all departments, with a strong use of atmosphere and a completely captivating story sure to haunt you afterwards. Criterion Collection's usual high standards bring out the remarkable visuals and sound. Extra features and booklet include many insightful interviews in this fancy set.",1509235200,2,821,5.323076923076923

7341030,5,B011SDC1LI,"Spoilers lurk.  When director/writer David Lynchs TV series, Twin Peaks was cancelled, he pitched an idea of a spin-off called Mulholland Dr.  It never got off the ground, but was given the OK to develop a made for TV movie instead.  A pilot that he thought might lead to a series.  The ABC execs didn't like it so the whole project was shelved.  A year or two later a French film executive agreed to finance a full length feature film which was release to critical acclaim in 2001 although it didn't do well financially.  Quite frankly the film is a mixture of mystery, romance, fantasy, comedy and drama all done in the style of Lynch.  There doesnt seem to be any right answers as to what the movie is about, and after listening to and reading various interviews with Lynch, Im convinced hes not sure either.

So heres my take.  The 147 minute film has two parts.  The first section takes up about 2/3rds of the movie.  In a star making turn, Naomi Watts sets the screen on fire as Betty Elms from Canada.  Shes just landed in L. A. and is hoping to make it as an actress.  Her aunt (Maya Bond) is letting Betty stay in her apartment while she is away on business.  Aunt Ruth is in the movie making business in some capacity.  Betty has a smile that seems to take over most of her face and it stays that way from the airport to the apartment.  Shes excited to be in Los Angeles.

In the films opening sequence, we see a beautiful brunette (Laura Harring) riding in a limo with 2 men driving on the clearly marked Mulholland Dr.  The limo suddenly stops on the dark road.  The driver pulls a gun and tells the woman to get out.  Just as she is about to exit, two cars come rumbling down the mountain road at high speed.  One of the cars crashes head on into the limo.  A few minutes later the woman crawls out of the car, stunned but alive.  Everyone else appears to be dead.  The woman stumbles to the apartment complex and sneaks into the apartment, just as Aunt Ruth is leaving for the airport.

When Betty arrives, still with smile in place, she finds the woman in the shower.  They talk a bit but Betty thinks its a friend of Aunt Ruth.  The woman, doesnt really know.  She doesnt know who she is, just that she was in a car accident.  When Betty says to look in her purse for identification, they find wads of $100 bills and a blue key.  But no ID.  With Betty now playing detective, the two women search for clues as to who the stranger is.  Shes adopted the name of Rita (after seeing a poster with Rita Hayworths name) for now.

Lynch introduces numerous characters into the film including non-acting friends.  Some are just there for a scene or two, never to return.  Lynch has explained that the story would expand on those characters if it ever became a TV series.  While this is all going on and Betty is waiting for a screen test or reading, a director named Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) is casting for his next film.  Hes one of those directors (like Lynch) who determines his final group of potential actors he might use, by looking at photographs.  In a meeting that includes the producers and agents are a couple of quiet men who obviously represent the mob (Angelo Badalamenti and Dan Hedaya).  They are insisting that a particular actress be cast in the lead by the name of Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George).  They won't take no for an answer.  Even if Adam has someone else in mind (Betty).

As Betty and Rita get closer to finding out what is going on, they also get closer on a personal level.  There are a couple of scenes with the pair that are as erotic as any youll see in a mainstream film.  There is another with Betty on her own.  And then there is the one where Betty reads for a scene with her potential star (Chad Everett) that will get your heart pounding.  One of my favorite scenes and typically Lynch is when Betty and Rita go to a club called ""Silento"" in the middle of the night.  There is an odd live show playing.  It doesnt make sense, but then a singer (Rebekah Del Rio) comes out and sings the most beautiful version of Roy Orbisons Crying you will ever hear.  Without music and in Spanish.  Betty and Rita begin bawling.  Betty is in love.

Lynch says that he created the scene after a music agent he knew called him and asked if he would listen to the singer.  Not for a particular film, but just soliciting an opinion.  So one morning Del Rio comes over with the agent to Lynchs basement recording studio.  She goes directly to the recording booth not knowing that an aide had turned on the recorder.  She sings the song and it is that version that made it into the film!

Back in the apartment, a strange blue box shows up.  Rita calls out for Betty but she doesnt answer.  She gets the blue key from her purse and opens the box.  It is empty.  Everything changes afterwards.  We find Betty is now Diane Selwyn who she and Rita once believed might be Ritas roommate.  But Diane appears to be strung out on drugs.  Shes unkempt and has no resemblance to the happy-go-lucky Betty we have been seeing.  Rita appears to now be actress Camilla Rhodes and one time lover of Diane.  But shes turned her romantic intentions to her director, Adam.  Rita/Camilla has invited Betty/Diane to a dinner party at Adams house.  But Diane is scorned, ignored and taunted by Camilla.  It all leads to a violent conclusion and a lot of head scratching.  My take is that the first part of the film is fantasy concocted by Diane either as a dream or by hallucinogens.  The last part is her real life.  Or just the opposite.  Or something else altogether.  The pieces don't fit nicely and there is plenty of room for interpretation.

It is a beautiful masterpiece for other things however.  The subtle humor, the gorgeous sets and costumes.  The great Angelo Badalamenti score is perfectly placed.  Ive seen the movie several times and I remember it best for Del Rios stunning song and Naomi Watts great performance.  And yes, I remember those erotic moments as well.  Highly recommended.

I also recommend the stunning Blu ray package.  It comes with a 1080p video resolution and original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  As this edition comes from Criterion I was expecting near perfection and thats what I got.  Here is an excerpt from the booklet that came with the package:

""Supervised by director David Lynch and director of photography Peter Deming, this new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution on a Scanity film scanner from the original camera negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter, and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Digital Vision's Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, and noise management.

Transfer supervisor: David Lynch, Peter Deming, Lee Kline.
Colorist: Stephen Bearman/Deluxe Digital London.
Additional color correction: George Koran/FotoKem, Los Angeles; Sheri Eisenberg/Colorworks, Culver City, CA.
4K scanning: Colorworks.""

In a word, the picture is perfect, with just the right hint of grain, great black levels.  The audio comes with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and it likewise, perfection.  There are subtitles only in English SDH.  Extras include a booklet with an interview with Lynch from Chris Rodleys book Lynch on Lynch.  There are several interviews with Lynch, Watts, Harring, Theroux, Badalamenti and others on video.  There is a fun deleted scene, some on-set footage and a trailer.",1485561600,4,7445,4.579666160849772

7341047,5,B011SDC1LI,"I am fascinated with David Lynch's Mulholland Drive and have owned two DVD's and also own the streaming video on Amazon. I purchased the Bluray and can say this edition is ""highly recommended"" for those who are truly interested in exploring this expressionist artwork. There is still a little detail that I have found not sufficiently resolved but that may be my 55"" TV is only 720p resolution.
Few people really seem to get to the deeper levels of what Lynch was at here but it can help to know some things about his life and interests. As a student he traveled to Europe hoping to study with Oskar Kokoschka, a prominent expressionist painter. Expressionism is ""a style of painting, music, or drama in which the artist or writer seeks to express emotional experience rather than impressions of the external world. ""Inner reality"" might be one description.  Most viewers seek to use familiar associations and preconceptions to imagine the film as a depiction of the external physical world (""Diane's"" dream/reality). Lynch certainly expects viewers to do so though the film can become much more when ""transcending deeper"". It can also be helpful to understand his devotion to Transcendental Mediation that he has practiced twice daily since 1973. It is a critical component in his life and is the focus of The David Lynch Foundation. One other detail I might mention is Lynch's penchant for using metaphor and symbolism both in his speaking and his artistic vision. Lynch has created a very meaningful and complete depiction that can be perceived from a very different POV than the puzzling mystery most people interpret. This Blu-ray reveals certain small details that I love discovering.and relating to the underlying theme the film can portray when on the right path.
The included interview I think I recall reading elsewhere but is a good read. The graphics on the foldout box are nice and the main menu can also be interpreted to add artistic symbolism.",1465603200,,1959,4.954407294832826

The movie begins with a freeze frame of the dancers which then evolves into the jitterbug.
The DVD / theatrical release and streaming versions all begin with a fade up onto the dancers and the jitterbug routine.

Looking into this, I was told by a Blu-ray technician: ""The Criterion was scanned from the negative which wouldn't necessarily have the fades built in if they cut A/B roll, whereas the older transfer was likely from an IP which would have those effects printed into it. This reminds me of the missed fade-out during the opening montage of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE on the newer Blu-ray (that was also an A/B roll scan). I guess Lynch missed this during the mastering process.""

I know it's only one second of film, but I hope Criterion does the right thing and issues a replacement disc. They did when they accidentally left a shot out of Lynch's Eraserhead on Blu-ray.

It's a story of love and hate.

7341072,5,B011SDC1LI,"""Mulholland Dr."" (2001) is directed by David Lynch (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet). This dreamlike film seems to be about aspirations, and about successes and failures. Naomi Watts had her breakout with this film as she brilliantly portrayed two opposing characters that expressed these dynamic differences. It is perhaps only near the film's end that the reality of the story comes to light, though it is never clearly delineated, and so we are left holding pieces of a puzzle that don't seem to quite fit. We are left wondering whether or not we correctly interpreted the clues. This is what makes the film so fascinating as it endlessly folds upon itself, shifting and weaving about like a dream, or a series of memories, constantly keeping the viewer off balance, making us want to go back and watch the film again, and again. Interestingly, Mulholland Dr. was originally developed as a pilot for TV with the expectation that it could be another Twin Peaks, but after the network didn't like the dailies the project was squashed and then bought up by someone else who had it made into a movie.

This blu-ray looks very nice as it has been remastered.

7341076,4,B011SDC1LI,"Mulholland Drive  Universal Pictures  2002  Rated R  DVD version

This is another David Lynch production and fully in keeping with his tradition.  The general audience will probably recognize the TV series Twin Peaks most readily.  I tried to think: to what other director would I compare him?  The first name that came to mind was Jodorowski (Holy Mountain, Dune) but despite the dreamlike quality of his films it strikes me that Jodorowski is probably more grounded in the real world than Lynch.  I've only seen a few of Lynch's works and listened to one interview on a talk show, but he struck me as seeming to live inside his dream worlds a good deal of the time.

So Mulholland Drive starts out confusing, then seems to be coming into focus as a straightforward story that merely started a bit challenging by confronting you with three or 4 different groups of people but then it seems like their stories are all going to converge into a coherent tale.  Fooled again!  Just as they seem to converge it's all shaken up until it seems fully dreamlike.  People morph into each other.  There's a very evil-looking figure: is that the Devil?  Is it even supposed to be real?  Certain symbols occur repeatedly throughout the film, as they do sometimes in a dream.  And when the film ends it's like waking from a dream, or more precisely from almost a nightmarea dream leaving you with an uneasy feeling of dread that you can't quite shake.

Speaking of dread: the one guy you'll see in a diner seems to me like a stand-in for Lynch himself.  Just a notion.

The surface structure involves a girl who comes to Hollywood hoping to be an actress, another girl that she befriends who clearly has been involved in something dangerous and probably illegal but has amnesia, and a director trying to make a movie.  But that's only the beginning.

I suppose you can see this as the dark side of the American Dream, epitomized in Hollywood.  If you enjoy surreal then you'll enjoy this film.  It has recently been re-released as a Criterion collection production, and Criterion only picks films they feel in some way are significant in film history.  Sadly I didn't view the Criterion version and now I definitely want to.  I give it a B+ in the vanilla version.",1447804800,,2251,4.649746192893401

I never got to see it in a theater as it never played in my area. Mulholland Drive is my favorite movie as every time I see it I find something new. I have my own theory about what it is about which I posted elsewhere on Amazon. Now, this is a review about this Blu-ray edition. I cannot say enough good things about this edition! I am so happy that Criterion picked this film for a Blu-ray release and that David Lynch agreed to do it. Criterion took this film and cleaned it up to the point where I saw things in it that I never saw before (and I've watched it countless times over the years). The colors really 'pop' now! You can actually see cars driving down the roads of Hollywood when they show the nighttime backdrop of LaLa Land! They brought up the light in some of the scenes where the shadows were rather dark and you can find new things lurking there. The sound has been brought up to excellent quality (and we all know that Lynch is a sound fanatic!). Thank you David Lynch for making this happen!! I wish you would release all of your films in this way- your fans deserve to see your films in all of their glory and Criterion is certainly the way to go. I did notice that the dvd edition clocks in at 2 hrs. 27 min. while the Blu-ray is at 2 hrs. 26 min. although I didn't notice any deleted scene(s). The interviews with Lynch and Co. are excellent and add some more dimension to the film. Lynch, of course, won't say what the film is about as it would 'ruin the mystery for everyone' and I get that. I want to keep viewing it again and again and coming up with my own theories.",1447027200,8,1733,4.176119402985075

7341088,3,B011SDC1LI,"I'll break this into two parts: The film and this particular release.

The film is, in my opinion, possibly the best of the 2000s, and possibly of the last 25 years or more. If you haven't seen it, it's best described as a dramatic mystery with horror elements, presented in a non-linear storyline. If you are a viewer who likes to be in control and be told what is going on at all times, this film will get on your nerves; If you adore being kept in the dark and not being given a clear path and direct answer -- You've found your holy grail.

Usually I'm astounded by the quality that the Criterion Collection are known for, but lately they've been dropping off in quality. They had a bad initial pressing of ""Eraserhead"", and now I've read that recent releases have had botched mastering. Well, maybe it's only my copy of the ""Mulholland Dr."" blu-ray, but add one to the growing number, unfortunately. It's a shame because the picture looks immaculate in certain scenes, but in a lot of others there's a ton of digital jitter that pops up and is distracting. Not sure what's up with it, but it's not worth the premium price without a truly pristine and honest 4k picture restoration.

Extras are cool with just over and hour of interviews. Sound is superb. Packaging is top-notch, as expected with CC. The most import thing, though, the picture, is a let down and the only reason for the 3 stars.",1446422400,12,1399,4.5
7341089,1,B011SDC1LI,"Amazing film, one of the most important in its decade, but you already knew that. The problem is that the Criterion Blu-ray transfer has severe compression issues leading to visible macro-blocking and detail loss. Do a little research before purchasing another Criterion Collection Blu-ray, as there have been a string of botched CC Blu-ray discs in recent months, the worst of which are Mulholland Dr. and My Own Private Idaho.

Just to be clear, grain structure is not the issue. Compression is the issue.",1446422400,9,507,5.035714285714286
7341090,5,B011SDC1LI,"Incredible work of art. Very obscure and hard to follow, but it is impossible not to get sucked in and become attached to the characters. There are explanations on line as to what is actually happening, which do make sense of a pretty hard to get movie. But I almost wish I hadn't indulged them. This film is great in all it's vagueness. The scenes all play very well despite overarching ambiguity. You understand what's happening scene to scene. And each scene is structured well with twists and turns. The performances are at times as good as performances can get. Naomi Watt's best movie in my opinion.",1446249600,3,605,4.663551401869159
7341091,5,B011SDC1LI,"After reading some of these reviews, I think I need to pipe up here.  First, my own affection for this film goes back to the release date, when I tried to see it in the theater.  I had been a Lynch fan since ERASERHEAD.  When MULHOLLAND DRIVE came to the local theater, interest in it was so low, the theater simply stopped screening it, right in the middle of the week, on the day I had set aside to see it.  This made the DVD release all the more exciting for me, and I went straight from work that Tuesday and picked up a copy.  Within the following three weeks, I watched it -- no exaggeration -- at least ten times.  I was like a psychedelic Johnny Appleseed as I toted it around to other film aficionados I knew, sharing it like it was some sort of cinematic gospel.  It was hypnotic and puzzling and at times funny, always firing on multiple levels.  Unlike some people, I do not even bother trying to figure it out.  My final conclusion is that Diane killed herself (or maybe The Cowboy killed her, but I'm pretty sure it was suicide).  When I saw this was to be released as a Criterion Edition, I didn't hesitate and preordered it.  I watched it the day it came.

To make this clear, there is a distinct difference between the DVD and this BD.  I noticed things I never noticed before.  For one, the hitman had one brown eye and one blue eye.  I had seen this movie at least twenty times and never saw that before.  It hopped out at me this time.  Another scene involved the hitman, when he was talking to the hooker, asking if she had seen any new girls on the street.  That woman's arm was full of bruises, suggesting that someone had been roughing her up.  This time out, on this BD, it popped, and I saw this character in an entirely new light, as a pathetic piece of human detritus.  And the scenes from the road, looking down at the cityscape, the view was sparkling with clarity while preserving the texture of the film.  The colors popped everywhere.  I can state unequivocally that there is a big difference between this edition and the previous DVD release.

Which brings me to another aspect of the BD.  Yes, there is some mild grain present, as it's supposed to be.  This is what I like about the Criterion Collection, that they aim to preserve the textures of the film.  Film has grain, period.  I suppose applying DNR to some big action flick won't matter much, if cinematography is not an essential element to it.  But in a film like this, this desire to alter the video quality by smoothing it out and -- and this is very harmful -- sharpening it, is misplaced.  To preserve the cinematic experience of the filmmaker's intent, the grain has to be visible.  This is the natural texture of the image.  And you don't want it sharpened, because once sharpening is applied, the grain is going to be exaggerated, as it'll be sharpened, too.  This is often obvious in night scenes, when a faster film -- which is grainier -- was used, and once sharpening is applied, the grain takes on a fine snow-like quality.  You do NOT want this.

That said,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulholland-Dr-Criterion-Edition/dp/B011SDC25S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulholland Dr. Criterion Edition</a>&nbsp;preserves all of the natural qualities, and restores the film to its original state, as close as you can get to the original cinematic experience.  When I say ""restores,"" I am referring also to the digital blurring of the pubic area in that famously discussed scene of brief, full-frontal nudity.  To anyone interested in this for prurient reasons, withhold your excitement: the scene was so tastefully done, you have to wonder why Lynch ever resorted to the awful modification to begin with.

As much as I have nothing but praise for this edition, there are two disappointments.  The first is that there was no audio commentary.  I love that feature on videos, and I was so looking forward to hearing Lynch's scene-by-scene analysis.  The other disappointment is that Lynch stuck to his guns and refused the insertion of the scene-selection feature.  But that's something I can live with, easily, as it only mildly annoyed me to begin with.  This isn't even remotely something I would complain about.

There are, however, some nice supplemental features.  There's a new interview with David Lynch and Naomi Watts, lasting about 27 minutes; a second collection of interviews includes the other primary cast members Laura Harring and  Justin Theroux, along with casting director Johanna Ray, which lasts about 36 minutes; there's an interview with Angelo Badalmenti, who performed the filmscore (that was very interesting, listening to him describe that process and the relationship he's had with Lynch through the years), about 20 minutes; and interviews with the production designer Jack Fisk and Director of Photography Peter Deming, about 22 minutes.  All of these interviews were recorded specifically for this Criterion edition, and all of them provided interesting insight into how an artist works, and the dedication such people have, despite having few rewards at the start of their careers.  For instance, Fisk revealed that it took Lynch five years to complete ERASERHEAD.  Clearly Lynch had a vision he was dedicated to.

Another extra is a deleted scene in the police station, with the two policemen we'd met at the crash site.  Then there's some on-set footage that again shows Lynch and his crew and actors at work, about 25 minutes long.  This was all great stuff to a Lynch enthusiast, and a fan of this film in particular.

Concluding the extra features is the trailer for the film.

In short, if you liked this film, this is definitely an improvement over the previous edition.  I'm thrilled to add it to my library.  Criterion knows how to do this right. They make videos for film buffs.

You can see every crease in Ann Miller's face, and see things in the background more clearly, little details that make David Lynch's work so interesting to begin with. The soundtrack has been cleaned and fine tuned tremendously. Not only was Mulholland Dr. meant to be a visual feast, but an aural one as well. The looming sounds of dread come across richer than the original DVD release, which was tinny and mid ranged. As far as extras, the interview segments are interesting, but the deleted scene is a bit lame. Mostly because it was already floating around the Internet for years.

7341096,3,B011SDC1LI,"Well at least it plays. Given the recent issues with Criterion blu rays I had my doubts about this playing when placed into my OPPO blu ray player...surprisingly it did. No need to speak about the film as it is a masterpiece, so this will speak only about this long anticipated blu ray release. I must say that the actual picture (not audio) shows no difference in blu ray vs. the regular DVD and that was a huge disappointment. I switched the two disc between my OPPO and I could not tell a difference. I even played the blu ray on the OPPO and the DVD on my Sony blu ray layer in the bedroom and saw no visible difference to the actual film. I was so hoping the film in blu ray would jump off the screen...it did not. Parts of the film actually looks distorted by comparison with the DVD. Huge let down. The positive side is the audio--a remarkable upgrade. I thought the sound quality in the DVD was fairly ballsy but the blu ray sound leaps out of the speakers. There are nuisances I never heard before watching the DVD played from my OPPO through my Bose speakers. I would venture to say this alone would be worth purchasing the blu ray but I am not sure. If you own the DVD and you don't care about the extras on the blu ray then don't bother. If you want a greater sound clarity then by all means go for it immediately. If you are looking for a stunning picture upgraded you will be highly disappointed.",1445904000,10,1410,4.245353159851301

8725015,5,B011SDC1LI,"Criterion restoration in accurate colour rendition viewed on an OLED series home screen, with sound through a $50,000 high fidelity sound set up, gives justice to this masterful cinema experience. In my view, this film deserves recognition as the finest film made, and it would not surprise me to see it topple VERTIGO in the critic's list of top ten films of all time.
Hollywood was once described as the ""dream factory"" in a somewhat disparaging way meaning it provides succour to the masses and lifts them out of their dreary lives. The apogee of this notion of Hollywood may have been during the Great Depression and the pre-eminent studio, MGM, with its gloss, fairyland sets, extravagant costumes, myriad lights and stars provided some sort of opium for the masses. But dreams, or the dream like state, or surrealism, is central to David Lynch's cinematic vision - and the other side of dreams, the nightmares, feature just as prominently. For it is our mental state, our subjective view, our dreams and nightmares which loom as each of our lived realities which gives such resonance to this film. Lynch understands. Nor can they be viewed piece meal but holistically, each element indivisible from any other element. Thus the music of Angelo Badalamenti, is organic to the viewing experience and cannot be experienced as say, separately like the obligatory ""night club scene"" in thousands of films, including his own BLUE VELVET. Badalamenti's music is an almost sub conscious element - Bernard Hermann and Lisa Gerrard spring to mind in a similar very powerful approach to the sound of cinema but Badalamenti takes the experience to another level. David Lynch and Andrei Tarkovsky are among the great artists of the 20th century, not just ""movie makers"".",1513468800,4,1762,5.017064846416382
