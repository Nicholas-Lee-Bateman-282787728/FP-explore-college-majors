8103224,4,B000E0OE62,"This is one of Bokeem woodbine's hits. Just like ""strapped"".  It's a love story that a girl could watch also. Of course bokeem is keeping it real, making bad decisions and makes things interesting with his persona and makes you want to see what he's gonna get into. Usually bad. He has a wonderful girlfriend and he makes bad decsions because the streets keep calling, he didn't heed her warning and some real serious drama takes place. This movie has a nice amount of action and you get to see bokeem like never before with some hand skills. Oh snap. This movie tugs at the emotions and carries a deep message. It is a good flick to see as far as action goes or just to enlighten someone or just remind yourself how blessed we all really are. As far as entertainment goes, It's just a good flick and bokeem is just a good actor. 3.5 stars out of 5.",1245283200,,849,4.30625

8103226,4,B000E0OE62,"Bokeem was excellent and Deborah Cox was very good. They came from similar background, but she outgrew him.  She tried to be patient and loving, but he had the mentallity of the street.  I think all young girls should watch this one to learn to balance their lives with equal yoke.",1169510400,2,281,4.490196078431373
8103227,4,B000E0OE62,"Bokeem Woodbine shines in this drama as Shadow a jailed boxer coming home after ten years away. The film focuses on his marriage to Sharon (Deborah Cox), and the strain that his time away and her success has put on their relationship. Not content with the hum-drum 9 to 5, Shadow decides to enter the seedy world of Fight Clubs to earn not just a hefty payday but also to regain his rep. Along the way he meets Vegas, a high rolling, tough talking hood brilliantly portrayed by newcomer John Sorrenti. Vegas promises to make Shadow a wealthy man but merely uses him for his own financial gain. This film also packs a powerful soundtrack. Definatley this years sleeper hit.",1142294400,,672,4.608333333333333
