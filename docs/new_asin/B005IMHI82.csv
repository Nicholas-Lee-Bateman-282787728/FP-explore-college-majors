I'm always a sucker for the first movie in the series, but I've got a surprise for you...in Beethoven's Christmas Adventure, Beethoven finally speaks!  Your kids will love it :)  How can you resist this sweet, large slobbering St. Bernard and his quest to save Christmas?

My son and I watched the movie together this morning and he was just glued to the TV.  He really got a kick out of the lost elf and of course, Beethoven.  (and I got a few good chuckles in there too!)  Beethoven's Christmas Adventure, I'm sure, will turn into a Christmas favorite in the years to come, for him :)",1320710400,13,1713,8.78735632183908

My 8 year old daughter loves Beethoven and any dog movie every made.  She loves Christmas.  So Beethoven and Christmas...she had to have it.  She likes it and has watched it over and over.  She usually watches it in the mini-van dvd player for long rides (cringing).  So I listen to the dialogue and music and barking for over an hour and grip the steering wheel tighter.  The plot to the movie is stupid, the characters don't act well, there's lots of dog barking.  I'm not a fan.  She is though. So if you don't plan on watching this as a family movie, it might work out fine.",1447200000,,708,4.637096774193548

4709662,2,B005IMHI82,"Could have been a much better movie, but it just had to include the gratuitous fart joke scenes, (Beethoven and another dog in a farting contest as the Elf holds his nose and waves away the bad air; very clever), as well as Beethoven telling the mom to ""Get your nose out of your butt crack"". Great. These are things we teach our son that it is not alright to do/say. It seems like every kids' movie made in the last fifteen years has to have the obligatory raunch, so your six year old can learn that it's cool and funny to be rude and gross. (Don't even get me started on Mike Meyer's ""The Cat in the Hat"". I think I hear Dr. Seuss spinning in his grave...).

There is also a very weird out-tro scene of a kid getting his skateboard forcibly stolen by some older kids, as he skates through the Christmas decorated town. He is left alone in the street yelling ""Oh, the injustice"". My wife and I were left scratching our heads at this one, and our six year old son even said ""That was weird"". Merry Christmas, kid. We'll be sticking to the classic Burl Ives Rudolph, and the 1940's classics.",1384646400,7,1091,4.270531400966184

4709666,5,B005IMHI82,"This is a great movie for all ages.  For children, there is no mention of Santa Claus; Beethoven (a dog) is the one that is  in the Christmas sleigh in this movie.  There are interesting/humorous adventures of Beethoven with an elf that helps deliver gifts on Christmas eve.  Overall, this is a family movie that all people should enjoy.",1355961600,2,337,4.661016949152542

4709668,2,B005IMHI82,"Beethoven is the supporting cast in a movie about a widow, her teenage son and an advertising campaign for the ASPCA.  The movie has little of the charm of the earlier Beethoven movies.  Preteens will get a few chuckles from this, but this is not a movie for kids who still believe in Santa.

I rated it only two stars for the thin plot, poor acting, and blatant advertising.  I've been adopted by shelter dogs, heartily support pet adoption, but this movie was just awful.  Definitely overpriced as well.",1353715200,,505,4.629213483146067

4709676,4,B005IMHI82,"Kid movies, especially in the direct to DVD variety like this one, are pretty formulaic, but that doesn't mean that they aren't going to entertain your family.

This movie includes the following predictable plot elements -- parent whose work gets more attention than their children and evil criminals. Add a real-life Christmas elf who falls out of the sled, losing Santa's magic toy bag, and a big slobbery Saint Bernard, and you've got elements that kids will enjoy.

In this movie Beethoven and the stray dog that tags along for this adventure can talk -- sort of. You see, the elf is actually a stable elf who takes care of the reindeer and all animals at the North pole, so he is able to understand dogs. Hearing the dogs talk added a lot of humor and some heart to the movie, and I appreciated the way this plot twist was presented.

CONTENT NOTE: I like to alert parents to plot elements that some choose to avoid. There are some passing gas joking (from dogs), and before the teen learns to ""believe"" he tells the Christmas Elf who has come straight from the North Pole that believing in Santa is kid stuff, but my 7-year-old didn't blink an eye at that.",1321920000,12,1162,4.523809523809524

Especially the fact That Beethoven could talk . in this one. unfortunately it was not as i expected the story was good common story not as good as Santa Buddies. & I really enjoy talking dog movies but this one was quite poor. the movie seem to focus around a Boy & his mom more so  then Beethoven. (Hence the title of the movie) & the other dogs. it was one of those movies where they made the commercial seem like it was really cool. Sad in a way because it kinda was leading in the Home Alone theme. involving two thieves in a toy store. wish Christmas movies would stop copying such a wonderful 90s Film that will never be re made into anything else.
This was probably my least fav Talking dog movie. I saw too less of Beethoven.",1321056000,,817,4.138364779874214
