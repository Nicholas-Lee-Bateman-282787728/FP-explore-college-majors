But what can I say but classic BJ!!!! I love it and want more .... it's worth the buy.",1524528000,2,338,4.044776119402985
8640715,5,B00IBMKM7K,"I've watched the Black Jack anime on websites before actually owning it. I was very excited when I found this version on DVD. Black Jack is one of the most well made and entertaining Animes I've ever seen. Every episode has a good storyline, the subtitles are wonderful. Pinoko's famous ""OHMIGEWDNESS"" is left untranslated as ""ACCHONBURIKE!"" I finally know what she's saying!

 The anime has plenty of suspense and there are often many complicated medical terms. Unlike the OVA, however, graphic details and surgery scenes are barely shown. The drawing style is also similar to some of Osamu Tezuka's other works, kind of cartoony at times, but unique. I like it because it's different. There are some really funny parts too. My sister and I found ourselves laughing extremely hard at some moments. ( I'm not going to give anything away) This anime has everything. There's plenty of humor, but you never forget that it's a medical drama. It's a work of art. You've got to watch it!",1429228800,5,981,4.833333333333333
