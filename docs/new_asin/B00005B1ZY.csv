7936374,2,B00005B1ZY,"What is this? I've seen three or four of these ""Adventures of Justine"" movies, and I'm still not sure. We always seem to be thrown into the middle of the story, and each ""movie"" instead feels much more like several unrelated vignettes. You also never can tell what ""real"" in this universe, and what's a dream.

And, disappointingly, there's never as much nudity or sex and you'd want to make up for all of this bad moviemaking. Daneen Boone is gorgeous, but in this installment you see her topless, not bottomless and never even partially-nude from behind (her best ASSet). You can forget anything more graphic than that.

There are some other attractive women and several sex scenes, but they're very boring, too long and not very graphic. Plus we get that artsy-smartsy 360-degree ever-revolving-camera angle on the sex scenes. Snoooooore",1447545600,3,840,4.950354609929078
7936375,2,B00005B1ZY,"The Adventures of Justine is a series of seven films, sold separately or sold together as a collection. At first glance, one may mistake The Adventures of Justine for one of those ubiquitous perky, adolescent TV shows. Lithe and lovely Justine (Daneen Boone) could easily be a Nancy Drew character and Professor Paul Robson (Timothy Dipri) seems to have been given an Indiana Jones persona. However, one realizes very soon that Justine's adventures are not so innocent.

Justine is a precocious teenage student and Professor Robson is a facility member at the Topacre Academy for gifted young girls. Justine along with several of the other girls are infatuated with the be-speckled but handsome Professor. Justine, who is ostensibly a virgin, and the Professor seem to get dragged into one international quest after another and while Justine manages, to her chagrin, (she desires to be de-flowered by the Professor) to remain innocent, her dreams and fantasies do not.

Justine and the Professor manage to get involved with a group of bad guys in each adventure, usually with Justine being captured but never violated, even while, people all around her, good and bad, are engaging in sex, which, by the way, Justine often watches.

Although Justine never physically takes part in any of the numerous sex scenes, she has a vivid imagination and occasionally gets seduced in one of her dreams. Her spunky roommate Ursula (Kimberly Rowe) and house mother, Madame Souvray (Jennifer Behr) are both sexually active and are often portrayed in simulated sex situations, as are the various nefarious ladies depicted in each film.

I had viewed several other films in the series before ""In Heat of Passion"", which by the way is the first of the seven films in the series. Although this is the first one, there isn't really anything that would let you know it precedes the others and therefore I would skip this one. While I enjoyed other movies in the series and rated them above average, I'm afraid that ""In Heat of Passion"" did not meet the standard of the next two films, ""Object of my Desire"" and ""Midsummer Night"". While the screenplay was somewhat corny on other Justine films, I'm afraid this one went way beyond cory past stpid and stopped at inane. The story follows three adventures, one in Egypt, one where a guy with the worst German accent I have ever heard kidnaps Justine and the third is in the Artic. NONE OF THESE EPISODES MAKES EVEN A SMIDGEN OF SENSE!

What`s Good

* Beautiful people, good casts

* Excellent bodies (male and female)

* Well done, though not overly suggestive sex scenes

* a bouncy, somewhat jocular quality

What's Bad

* poorly done, though not overly suggestive sex scenes

* Low budget and it shows

* ridiculous plots/stories

* Sex scenes seem sanitized (dispassionate)

* mediocre acting at best

* limited features

Conclusion

You're thinking, if the story was so bad, why not one star instead of two? Good question. Yes the plot is lame, really lame, example: Justine is standing half naked tied to a pole and the man and woman culprits, make fun of her because she's a virgin.  They go on to say they are going to show her what she is missing, wherein they proceed to have sex, BEHIND HER, like she had eyes in the back of her head. This episode took place in the artic, where everyone but Justine is in heavy warm thermal clothing. Justine is wearing a night gown, but even though there are even more stupid scenes, the cast is attractive, a little cutesy and mildly sexy, so I gave it two stars.",1131580800,,3537,4.759410801963994
7936376,5,B00005B1ZY,"Cute little mini-series, kind of a ""serious-comedy""; Adventures revolve around Justine a student at a private girls school and her Professor Robson. This is the 1st of the series and it introduces the main characters. Most of the short stories involve archeological and antiquities adventures. Plenty of nice nude sceens of Daneen and a few of her friends...",1011744000,6,358,5.189655172413793
