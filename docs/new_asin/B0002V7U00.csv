2124309,4,B0002V7U00,"I seen this movie on lifetime, (I try to watch as many Christmas movies as I can). I didn't think I would like it at first, but I truley did. Nancy McKean gets in an accident and wakes up to a different life. She lived a very busy life by herself, she wakes up to a husband and children and doesn't want to be there. It has been a year since I have seen the movie I can't really remember how it ends, alls I know is that it is a good movie and I can't wait to catch it again.",1162598400,10,475,3.712871287128713
2124310,5,B0002V7U00,"This is a delightful Christmas offering, especially for those who remember Nancy McKeon only as the street-wise tomboy in Facts of Life.  The character she plays in Comfort & Joy is successful but single, selfish and unhappy.  Even her parents have divorced. Enroute to a business-related Christmas party, she gets lost in a less than fashionable part of town while driving her Jaguar, skids on the ice, and hits a tree.

When she awakens, she is poorly dressed and in an old station wagon, while the man who helps her claims to be her husband. He then takes her to their lower middle class house nearby, where she meets her two children.  Her husband runs a homeless shelter, and she supposedly has been his unselfishly helpful mate for a number of years.

Unable to accept the situation, she visits her office and some of her friends, who confirm that she left the company about Christmas time several years ago and became a wonderfully caring and unselfish person.  Her parents also have remarried, much to her surprise. She then skids on the ice and is knocked unconscious again, but this time she awakens in her Jaguar and wearing designer clothes again.  What happens next is classic, but you'll have to see the movie to find out.",1151107200,,1236,4.72093023255814
2124311,5,B0002V7U00,"This movie is centered around the Christmas holiday, but would be great to watch anytime of the year.  I saw this on Lifetime and ordered it from Amazon because I knew I would want to watch it again.",1140652800,9,199,4.2368421052631575
2124312,1,B0002V7U00,"Just an fyi. This made-for-tv movie may be terrific, but you wouldn't want to buy this one thinking that you're getting the real deal.

Mr. Bunny Doesn't play by the rules.

I'd originally rated this five stars. But if I'm getting downvotes for a friendly warning to my fellow Forsythe fans, then to heck with it.",1132617600,7,313,4.571428571428571

2124314,4,B0002V7U00,"As soon as I heard Lifetime would release the movie ""Comfort and Joy"" DVD I jumped at the chance to own it! I already loved the movie and I wanted to add to my growing Christmas-themed movie collection.

The story stars Nancy McKeon as Jane Berry, a woman who gets the chance to live another life-- the life as a wife and mother, the self-described ""New and improved Jane"" after crashing her Jaguar into a post and generally being confused about her new identity.

It's a heartwarming romantic comedy set amongst the backdrop of the Christmas season. Jane's husband, Sam played by Steven Eckholdt does a fantastic job in his role.

Another delight of the movie was Dixie Carter bringing spunk to the role of Jane's mother Frederica. Other noteworthy performances are by Paul Dooley (Jane's father) and of course, the children.

The DVD version features a twenty-two minute featurette with cast interviews on topics ranging from destiny to holiday movies to dysfunctional family situations during the holidays.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun movie that'll put a smile on your face.",1102896000,103,1098,4.945652173913044
2124315,4,B0002V7U00,"This is a very touching made for TV Christmas movie.  Nancy McKeon is such a wonderful actress and I miss her in movies.

2124371,4,B0002V7U00,"Christmas movies.... Time travel movies... I love 'em ALL! THAT said, the plot is a little thread-worn.
Yes, it is sort of a thrown together modern version of Nicolas Cage's ""FAMILY MAN""...
and Donna Reed & Jimmy Stuart's ""IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE"".
A successful single woman has an auto accident on Christmas Eve. She wakes up married with children.
She finds out what she's been missing, and it changes her life goals.
Paul Dooley, who plays the woman's father contributes, greatly, to the film's success.
There are many familiar faces:
Nancy McKeon (Facts of Life [8 seasons]) and Dixie Carter (DESIGNING WOMEN [plays her mother]{1939-2010})

It's somewhat of a taking versus giving contrast, tho the character in her all-business mode was never mean or particularly selfish, just focused on her-her-her.

I actually really enjoy romantic comedy holiday movies - Holiday in Handcuffs, The Most Wonderful Time of the Year, Holiday Switch - you name it, I enjoy it.  But this movie was just painful and awkward.  There's a loooong conversation between the main character (Jane) and her parents that I think was supposed to be funny, but it was really just confusing and boring.  The dialogue is terrible and the acting by Jane and Jane's mother (Dixie Carter) is horrendous.  Dixie Carter's over-acting is painful to sit through and just makes me wish the movie would end.
I basically sat through the whole movie to see if there was a resolution and there really wasn't one.  Lame.",1417910400,,714,4.764227642276423

2124415,5,B0002V7U00,"This movie from Lifetime has been a favorite since I first saw it about 5 years ago.  It's a nice movie about a reasonably happy young woman named Jane who has a great job and is very happy with her life.  Or so she tells her friend, who tells her she'd make a great mother.  Her boyfriend is not really that interested in her -- he's very happy with their relationship just as it is.
  Then something happens to her.  She has an accident and is transported 10 years into the future and gets to see how her life could have been.  She has a husband, two kids, and a life that is great -- or so they tell her.  She's confused, downright discombobulated, and wants desperately to get back to where she belongs in her old life.
  And it's well worth the watching to see what she decides and why.
  A lovely movie that brings me back yearly; I like the sights, the sounds (there are some nice arrangements to the music, even the old heard-them-a-million-times songs).  Good cast, nice movie all around.  If there is any downside for me, it's that I really don't want it to end.  Fortunately, there are many other good movies out there.",1417046400,3,1130,4.339712918660287

Some of them, I can't remember some of the movie names(I'm old, give me a break!),  but each has touched me in a different way. I won't go into detail, other folks have done that nicely.

It teaches us that money, etc. aren't what's important in life.  The character that Nancy McKeon plays learns this by seeing into her potential future over the holidays.  It's similar to Nicholas Cage's ""Family Man"", ""Mr. Destiny"", Jennifer Love Hewitt's ""If Only"", and other movies that allow the characters to see the ""what if"" scenarios of how their life may turn out or may have turned out if they would have taken a different path in life.",1384992000,,572,4.623762376237623
2124461,4,B0002V7U00,"COMFORT & JOY just doesn't do it for me as a movie title; it's so blah. Thankfully, the movie itself rises above its title. If, like me, you'd wondered what in heck happened to that tough, street-savvy tomboy from THE FACTS OF LIFE, well, Nancy McKeon, a.k.a. Jo Polniaczek, has been all this time churning out made-for-television movies.

Her 2003 Lifetime movie, COMFORT & JOY, is an upside-down version of IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. It's a gender-reversed riff on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Family-Man-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00005JCCC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Family Man (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;(2000). It predates&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Family-Thanksgiving/dp/B005CFC0L0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Family Thanksgiving</a>&nbsp;(2010), Daphne Zuniga's similarly-themed television film. These movies play on our proclivity to indulge in the ""What if?"" game. Should I place a Mild Plot Spoilers alert here? (I think I just did.) Jane Berry (Nancy McKeon), workaholic vice-president of a Connecticut advertising firm, sees Christmas Eve as just another work day. She's conned herself into believing her life is aces and oh-so-fulfilling. Never mind that her relationship with her glib boyfriend is sunk in inertia. (""How is Peter Pan?"" Jane's dad wryly enquires of her smug significant other.)

On this Christmas Eve, see Jane Berry battle inclement weather while enroute to some festive work function. See her lose control of the wheel and her Jaguar careen into a street post. Jane wakes up to a flipped scenario. She's suddenly a housewife in the 'burbs with two kids and a stranger for a husband. So the question is, is this a time travel fantasy or a severely prolonged case of amnesia?

It's not like Jane's old life never existed. It's just that she seems to have lost the past ten years. She marvels and is alarmed at the drastic shifts. This Jane she inhabits now is perceived as a pillar of the community, is content to be a stay-at-home mom, has relinquished the ambitions of a driven career woman, has long ago traded her Jag for an unsleek station wagon. I guess, somewhen in that interim, she took to heart another of her dad's sayings: ""Make more or desire less.""

See Jane try to come to grips. Witness her periodic freak-outs and her children's bombarding her with questions like ""Mom, are you going nuts?"" and ""What's it like to go nuts?"" and ""Mom, are you still nuts?"" The one familiar thing is that her parents still exist in a nettled state of dysfunction. Is that Dixie Carter playing Jane's insufferably obnoxious - her fans would call her performance ""sassy"" - mom? Yes, it is.

Somewhere along the way, Jane Berry - er, Jane Keller - does get a grip. She begins to enjoy her cute kids and appreciate her kind husband Sam (Steven Eckholdt). It's a plot development that surely won't stun any viewer. The only conundrum to keep you and me on tenterhooks is how will things resolve? And, oh yeah, is it time travel after all? Or a case of amnesia? COMFORT & JOY (Uggh, that title again) is a solid holiday movie, and Nancy McKeon is as watchable as ever. I'm calling it an above average 3.5 out of 5 stars. In today's ubiquitous social media, I only wish there were more water cooler talk whenever Nancy McKeon makes a movie. I can't be typing ""imdb"" all the time, mostly because I've worn out the ""i"" tab on my keyboard. Oh, well, you take the good, you take the bad...",1384387200,2,3532,5.23321554770318

An upwardly mobile, single young woman has an accident on Christmas Eve and wakes up married with children.  I will not go into great detail here, but she finds out what she's really been missing in her life and it changes her values and goals in life. If you like the two films I mentioned earlier, then I am sure you will enjoy this movie.  I gave it four stars because all of the actors do a good job, but Paul Dooley, who plays the young woman's father is a standout and he really makes the film worth watching.

I think they could have done a lot more with this than they did. Better modern picks are A Boyfriend for Christmas, The Christmas Card, even The Snowglobe, which is silly but fun. Oldies but goodies like Shop Around the Corner, It's a Wonderful Life, A Christmas Carol and even all of the children's classics are fun, or just tune into whatever Lifetime or Hallmark are playing that year to find the best new ones.

2124628,5,B0002V7U00,"I happened to catch this on Lifetime when it aired and was thrilled when it was released to DVD.  This movie is just wonderful to watch.  It makes you feel good at the end.  Here's why:

First, the kids in the film are very sweet and in no way obnoxious.  They are a delight to watch, and their interaction with other actors is right on the mark.  There is no worry that they will become brats in an effort to make them ""cute"".  None of that stuff in this movie.  Just really great kids.

The supporting cast is finely crafted and knits together all the quirky aspects of families, including some painful ones, such as divorce.  It all works through great dialogue and veteran actors who know their stuff.

Steven Eckoldt is a charm on the screen as Jane's husband, Sam.  He brings a warmth and understanding to the story that makes this film work.  Otherwise, it might as well have never been filmed.

And finally, there's Nancy McKeon, who has to bring on both comedy and drama as her character of Jane Berry tries to get back to reality after an accident.  She does it well and definitely pulls off what can be a cliched Christmas theme.  It's not an overcooked performance, and her scenes with her ""family"" come off as if they really had fun doing them.  It's fun to see her transformation in this film from high-powered executive to unexpected housewife and mother.

This is a genuinely good film that didn't get enough attention, in my opinion.  It is a feel-good movie that is completely worth the buy and will become a favorite during the Christmas season, guaranteed!",1275177600,,1576,4.544483985765124

This sweet, sentimental darling does a great job with warm characters. I add this one to my favorites at Christmastime.

I knocked this movie down a star because, while I love the concept, it does look like a made-for-TV movie. The characters are decent, but sometimes a little to wholesome (particularly Sam, Jane's future husband). There really is never any climax to the movie, and it ends rather abruptly.

2124657,4,B0002V7U00,"I have seen this compared to Nic Cage's ""family man"" but I think this is much better. Jane is a single successful woman, who isn't as much unhappy with her life, she just doesn't know how empty it is. On Christmas eve she gets in a car accident and wakes up to her husband asking if she is ok. Except she has no idea who this man is, and has no memory of her ""kids."" Freaked out, she goes about trying to get back to her life, but her apartment has someone else in it, her on and off boyfriend tells her he hasn't seen her in 10 years, and even her drivers license says she is married. With no place else to go she goes back to her *husband* and kids and does her best to adjust to her life. Ultimately she likes this life better than her single one.

A couple of things that sets this apart from ""family man"". Jane is likable. Jane's husband, Sam, truly seems to love her and Jane's children both can act and make it appear that they love Jane also. Jane's new life comes with sacrifices but they are not so bad as that audience can't see the appeal.

In the end she does got back to single life, but of course, gets to meet Sam and live the life she only previewed before. Very good flick, well acted and well plotted.",1259366400,2,1220,4.079166666666667

2124686,3,B0002V7U00,"A Lifetime Original Movie, this is a very similar film to Nicholas Cage's ""Family Man."" Nancy McKeon plays a very sucessful, yet emotionally unsatisfied, corporate executive. She is the epitome of the ""21st century woman""- independent, powerful, beautiful apartment, expensive car- but is she really happy? Her empty relationship with a co-worker and dysfunctional family make it especially difficult to just plow through the holiday season without taking stock of what her life has become. Despite her outward success, the unspoken question in her mind is "" How did I get here?""

The idea of a different life is put to the test when she has an accident and wakes up in an alternate reality as a wife, mother and pillar of her community. She also sees how her different life choices affect those around her. The alternate life does not come without its compromises (no expensive car or clothes in this version of life), but do the pros outweigh the cons? Are the benefits  of this ""new"" life enough to make her stay? Are the experiences in the alternate life fulfilling enough to make her want to jump ship and set her sights for a new shore?

I won't answer that question. You'll have to see how it turns out for yourself.

It is a great movie for anyone who has ever wondered ""what if"" or who has thought that ""the grass is always greener on the other side."" It is a story about finding your life's balance and knowing that, whatever you choose, does not come without its sacrifices.  Those sacrifices, however, if it's the right choice for you, are a small price to pay for true happiness and living your best life.",1187913600,33,1618,4.663157894736842
