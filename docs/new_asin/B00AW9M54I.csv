5511341,5,B00AW9M54I,"I love this movie (even though my friend got scared in half of the movie and I'm left in suspense). I really did love it though, It's like Romeo and Juliet ( the zombie's name is R, and the humane girl's name is Julie, Romeo Juliet, get it).",1359849600,,241,4.041666666666667
5511342,5,B00AW9M54I,"So you probably knew or read that the new film Warm Bodies is based on a young adult novel, and you thought to yourself, ""no way, not another Twilight."" Surprisingly, this film, while fine for young adults, appeals to the mature romantic in all of us as well.

Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: First Class) stars as ""R"", the zombie with a non-beating heart of gold who does the unthinkable: he makes you swoon over a dead guy. R can't remember his name or anything about his past life, and he spends his days aimlessly roaming around an abandoned airport with his best friend, ""M"" (Rob Corddry - The Daily Show with Jon Stewart). He explains his sorry state of affairs via voice-overs, and we are immediately drawn in by his casual sense of humor about his sad circumstances. R is someone you would want for a friend.

R has nothing to live for (pardon the phrase), that is until he meets Julie (Teresa Palmer - Take Me Home Tonight). Julie's father, Grigio, (John Malkovich - Con Air) is a powerful figurehead who leads the remaining, uninfected humans in preserving their mortality. They live in an army base while Grigio and other soldiers carry out nightly patrols, keeping an eye out for any corpses they may have missed.

R, M and a group of their zombie buddies cross paths with Julie, her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco - 21 Jump Street) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton - Crazy, Stupid, Love) when they are on the hunt for their next meal. R tells us that he does not enjoy hurting people, and he would appreciate if you look away while he executes Perry for sustenance.

While not overly graphic, we do get a few shots of R eating Perry's brains (including that which he saves in his pocket for later), but this is less gross and more symbolic, as R explains that he can absorb people's feelings and memories from their brain matter, much in the same way that cannibals believed they could absorb someone's power from eating their flesh. We are moved as opposted to disgusted as R lives vicariously through flashbacks of Perry's life, and he explains that even though he feels remorse for the way in which he feeds this insatiable need, this act allows him to feel alive again, even if only temporarily.

R sees Julie and immediately falls in love. He saves her from his hungry friends by putting some of Perry's now dead blood on her face to cover up her live smell. This allows her to walk past the corpses without drawing attention (paging The Walking Dead).

R leads Julie back to his ""home"", an abandoned airplane where he stores the items he collects on his aimless travels. Most prominently featured are R's records, which punctuate his feelings with the likes of Guns 'n' Roses and John Waite. When Julie asks why R prefers records to iPods, R responds, ""better...sound...""

At first, Julie is afraid of R, but predictably she learns to trust him. She wants to go home, but R informs her it's not safe to leave right away, so she stays with R, passing time by teaching him some of human games and doing other cutesy things. The two grow closer, but how could they ever be a couple?

R realizes that he is slowly being cured, and that it is Julie who is bringing him back to life. Though, when R and Julie's relationship starts giving the other zombies hope, what can at first be beautiful turns dangerous as they are not only escaping humans who don't believe in a cure, but they must also evade creatures known as ""Boneys"". Boneys live among the corpses, and they kill anything with a heartbeat without a second thought. This was never a problem for the corpses before because they never had a heartbeat, but now...

Warm Bodies is a terrific date movie, and it is appropriate for young adults as well, as is evidenced by its PG-13 rating. It will leave you with a warm feeling and it might even make you cry. Warm Bodies has been cited by People magazine as ""the best zombie movie in nearly a decade."" While not all guys may agree, girls may see this as the zombie film they've been waiting for.",1359849600,3,4007,4.531120331950207
5511343,4,B00AW9M54I,"Attached to this film is a trailer for ""World War Z"", an adaptation of Max Brooks' excellent novel which looks to be a shoe-in for one of the year's worst films. Packed with overabundant CGI, a contrived plot, and seeming to be lacking in the depth that made the source material so great, it's pretty indicative of the current state of zombie films as a whole. What a relief it is, then, that ""Warm Bodies"" is one of the most charming and original takes on the sub-genre I've seen in a while, and something I would heartily recommend to anybody with an open mind.

The plot, based on a novel by the same name, takes place from the perspective of ""R"", a young, attractive zombie with a witty inner monologue and desire to be more human. Enter Julia, a girl whom he lays eyes on after killing her boyfriend. He takes her back to his home (a refashioned airplane that looks like a hipster heaven), and slowly begins to become more human as his heart begins to beat again. Soon, this begins to spread like a virus among the zombie populace (ironic, I know), and they begin to regain consciousness. However, the humans still won't forgive and forget, and the real threat to both the zombies and humans, terrifying skeletal creatures called ""Bonies"", begin to pose serious problems. Will the seemingly doomed romance last?

You'll be asking yourself that question throughout, which is what makes this film such a winner. Nothing is ever really certain, as it is an experience that is all at once refreshing and unpredictable. At any given moment, something seems as if it's going to go wrong with ""R"" and Julia, and you're left biting your nails in suspense not from horror, but from the desire to see the relationship work. This relationship is the beating heart of the film, and honestly, this is what makes it such an enjoyable watch.

That said, it might not be for everybody. Much like many cult films (think ""They Live""), ""Warm Bodies"" can slow to a crawl just as much as it can speed up to a fever pitch. While some people, like myself, may appreciate the interactions between a human and a zombie, and the unique dilemmas brought about by those, others may find these to be slow and tedious. This is understandable, and I can't fault people for that. This isn't as peppy and constantly funny as the trailers may lead you to believe; its tone is more one of ambiguity, and for some, that may be too demanding.

What everybody should appreciate about this quirky little piece, though, is the excellent acting on all fronts. Nicholas Houlten as the lead is a delight, his ability to balance out his inner monologue with convincingly ""dead trying to be alive"" acting proving to be a winning combo. Teresa Palmer plays an equally as convincing love interest, acting pretty much exactly how somebody falling in love with the living dead would act. Special props should be given to Analeigh Tipton, who plays a charmingly ditsy best friend to Julie, and John Malkovich (what is HE doing here?!) as Julie's literally militaristic anti-zombie father. The acting drives the film, really, and if one actor was replaced, it just wouldn't be as good.

Tied to together with some neat cinematography, which is clever enough to ignore the lacking special effects, and a lovably atypical soundtrack, ""Warm Bodies"" is destined to be one of this generation's cult classics. Not for everybody, sure, but those who like it will adore it, and it may likely become one of their favorite films, and one of their favorite cinematic romances.

Now, how did their hearts start beating again anyhow...?

5511344,2,B00AW9M54I,"""Warm Bodies"" is only lukewarm. A zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) eats the brains of Perry (Dave Franco) and thereby falls in love with Perry's girlfriend, Julie (Teresa Palmer). The movie is meant to be a bit scary, a bit funny, and a bit romantic, but I wasn't much scared, I didn't laugh, and the romance was stale and flatfooted.

Julie and R jump into a sports car to escape from menacing zombies and skeletons. The top is down; it begins to rain. They drive into an abandoned, post-Apocalyptic suburban neighborhood. Julie is cold; she has to take off her clothes. She does so in front of R. Teresa Palmer is a very beautiful young woman. R is a frustrated teen zombie madly in love with Julie. The director does absolutely nothing with this scene. There's no special lighting; the camera doesn't show us Julie's beauty as desperate, lovestruck R would see it.

There are multiple chase scenes, none of which make much sense. Julie sees her well-armed father in a convoy and does nothing to join him, but later escapes on her own to join him, a much riskier trip. Why didn't she go earlier? No explanation.

If you're looking for a funny zombie movie, check out ""Shaun of the Dead,"" and ""Zombieland."" If you're looking for a fully realized romance between a living woman and a dead man, watch ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" and ""Truly Madly Deeply."" If you like romances between women and monsters, see Jean Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast,"" or ""King Kong.""

""Warm Bodies"" isn't a bad movie. It has its moments. R whines to his fellow zombie, Rob Corddry, about Julie, and Corddry's one word responses is the funniest line in the movie. The movie's conclusion is heartwarming if a bit half-baked.",1359849600,2,1697,4.665551839464883
5511345,5,B00AW9M54I,"This Romeo & Juliette approach to the zombedy breathes new life and a well-placed sense of hope into the genre.  While Shaun of the Dead (2004) and Zombieland (2009) succeeded in lighter-hearted, smiley approaches, neither conveyed the sense of romance-driven hope above desperation in their apocalyptic settings.  So see Warm Bodies!  You'll leave feeling hopeful.

As ""R"", Nicholas Hoult's narration adds an inflexive zombie-perspective and comedic charm regarding the idiosyncratic behavior of animated corpses and, given the unique opportunity, their romantic proclivities.  The narration feels natural and unscripted as if you were watching a home video of yourself and Mystery Science Theater-ing it.  This nearly impromptu style reveals that he goes by ""R"" because he can't remember his name--only that it started with a zombie-grunting ""rrrrrrhu?""

After introducing us to his daily lumbering grind, he rescues Julie (Teresa Palmer) from his ""friends"" and keeps her safe.  As he struggles to remember how to enunciate we learn that he has also clearly forgotten how to talk to a girl...since he has no memories of his life at all!  The mix of his awkwardly nigh-mute zombiism, his self-deprecating narrations (which are humanly articulate) and his high schoolish nervousness present an excellent platform to develop these characters and their relationship.

Unlike Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, the gore was quite minimal.  There were no slow throat-tearing bites, flesh-rending or disembowelments by super strong zombie hands, which makes this ZomCom more watchable by those who don't care for shocking displays of gore of suffering.  This was a tasteful choice and, even as a gorehound, in this case I very much approve.

I was really pleased with the music.  Songs like Bruce Springsteen's ""Hungry Heart"" and Jimmy Cliff's ""Sitting in Limbo"" mesh tongue in cheek irony with generally spectacular scoring decisions.  Not to mention playing ""Pretty Woman"" when R is receiving a ""human"" makeover, a great scene in which the stellar supporting character Nora (Analeigh Tipton) turns Hoult from zombie to hottie.

The Shakespearian elements were not limited to the main characters' names:  R[omeo, perhaps] and Julie[tte].  Their relationship seems little less than ""star-crossed"" from the start, she learns not to fear or hate R as he becomes ""more human,"" her ex-cause-he's-dead boyfriend Perry is essentially Paris, Julie's father (John Malkovich) plays the lord of House Capulet role and he hates zombies as if they were Montagues, Nora plays Shakespeare's helpful ""nurse"" of House Capulet, and Marcus (Rob Corddry) does a heartfelt and transformative job filling the shoes of Mercutio.  There's even a balcony scene, which was the only unsubtle reference--but didn't feel forced.

I generally enjoyed every aspect of this movie.  I have few small complaints and I'd rather not draw any attention to them.  This film is too good to chance scaring you off over minor quibbles.

So go see this.  You'll leave feeling satisfied and hopeful.",1359763200,2,3051,5.374736842105263
5511346,5,B00AW9M54I,"I'm a guy that loves his zombie flicks. A few of my favs are Romero's zombie franchise, Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive, Planet Terror, and Zombieland. It could be argued that this movie is the 'Zombie Twilight' In a way, it is, but it's actually done very well. The acting is good, and the characters are likable. It has a few cheesy and funny moments such as R telling Julie to act like a zombie so the others won't eat her. Our male protagonist is a zombie named R. He can't remember his name or what happened before the apocalypse. He lives at an airport with his other zombie friends. On the prowl for human flesh, R runs into a beautiful girl named Julie. He begins to fall in love with her, and it slowly makes him human again. Their relationship is very sweet and adorable. Their new friendship is soon threatened by the skeletal zombies called bonies. The humans and the zombies must team up together to rid the world of the real monsters. If you love zombies and love stories, I'd definitely recommend WARM BODIES!!!",1359676800,,1024,4.452127659574468
5511347,5,B00AW9M54I,"It has been a long time since I have gone into a film with the kind of high expectations I had for this film. I have read the book and I absolutely love it, so it's safe to say I was setting myself up for disappointment and I will admit there are a few subplots from the book I would have loved to see in this film and got cut. The 70% or so of the book that made it into this movie is done perfectly it is a poignant coming of age film, a heartfelt romantic comedy and a Zombie horror movie all wrapped up in one. I cannot recommend this movie enough, it's worth it to just to see Rob Cordry's amazing portrayal as ""M"" it was amazing.

This one is worth owning because you will want to watch it again and again.",1359676800,5,712,3.910344827586207
5511348,5,B00AW9M54I,"(Possible spoilers)
This is a zombie romantic comedy.  Zombie comedies in themselves are still a brand new genre imo, but try a zombie romantic comedy , and that's still a relatively untouched genre. First movie that came to mind before I saw ""Warm Bodies"" was ""My Boyfriend's back"" from 1993. I loved that movie, and I definitely love this movie.

Where to begin? It's extremely funny, but it does it in a way that it is natural and not scripted.

The acting choices were great for this: Teresa Palmer,  Nicholas Hoult, Analeigh Tipton, Rob Corddry, and of course John Malkovich.

Plot: Well the trailer does give away a lot of the movie.  A zombie named ""R"" (Hoult) is one of the few zombies that has been able to transcend his ""condition"" and actually is displaying some human interactions that he actually has made a connection with a beautiful girl named Julie (Palmer) whose part of a zombie resistance force.  They make an unexpected connection between themselves that will change their lives. Meanwhile Julie's father w Grigio (Malkovich) whose a top military person  does not share Julie's views that zombies can be capable of anything other than feeding on human flesh. To further complicate things  a group of zombies (?) called ""Bonies"" inhibit ""R""'s area and are looking for him.

I know this is based on a novel but not reading the novel I judged the movie as a standalone feature (of course comparing it other zombie movies) and of course zombie lore in general.

I know the great George Romero is one of the first directors that I know off that explored the ideas of zombies still retaining some human characteristics, and even still having their memories (though fragmented) still in them, so I was interested to see how this movie played that. I liked that the movie explored that fully.

Jonathan Levine's direction is good.  All the scenes are setup very well for perfection.

""R""'s progression starts very slowly (from the narration we get him from in the beginning to zombie grunts we come to expect from a dead corpse) then gradually it accelerates to where he actually perform speech very well and do other things. Likewise ""R""'s and Julie's relationship doesn't just fly off, but it grows gradually as well as we see how ""R"" is beginning to change because of her.

Hoult and Palmer are absolutely perfect for their roles. They were both convincing and worked well off each other.

The jokes in this movie are funny as hell. I don't remember any zombie movie where the zombie played music for a girl, or a zombie learns how to drive, or even offered a girl a beer!!!

There's action and gore but it's  PG 13, so it's toned down, but that wasn't the real selling point of the movie. The selling point was the comedy and romance, and the movie definitely nailed it out of the park in that regard.

The screening audience I saw it with laughed at every setup and every joke literally. There's some social commentary as well, and some nice little twists that kept the audience entertained till the very end.

I really recommend it.",1359417600,2,3051,4.6992481203007515
5511349,4,B00AW9M54I,"Seattle's Isaac Marion (self-published ""Where Are They Now"") wrote the book on which this goofy (and unconventional) romantic comedy (with ZOMBIES?!) is based. Director Jonathan Levine (""50/50"") did the honors at the helm.

Despite a pretty standard opening with the walking dead lurching through a demolished city looking (and finding!) humans on which to munch, this gradually evolves into a laugh-out-loud comedy and a sweet romance. You'll just have to trust me! (The tag line is: Cold Body, Warm Heart.)

We see:
  * Nicholas Hoult (""About a Boy"") is R, for lack of a better name; he just can't remember... He seems to have the right instincts (I want to protect her, not eat her), but is extremely confused (How do you talk to a girl?).
  * Teresa Palmer (""I Am Number Four"") is Julie. Their balcony scene made me wonder if his full name was Romeo. This actress bears an uncanny resemblance to a blonde Kristen Stewart.
  * John Malkovich (""RED"") is Julie's father, General Grigio, who heads the human defense forces in their walled fortress, fighting zombies and skeletors.
  * Dave Franco (""21 Jump Street"") is Perry, one of the armed defenders of the besieged humans. Yes, he's James Franco's younger (handsomer) brother.
  * Analeigh Tipton (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") is Nora, Julie's friend. She offers her cosmetics when they try to disguise our hero as a human, not a corpse. She says, ""I know it's hard to get a boyfriend, what with the apocalypse and all, but...""
  * Rob Corddry (Lots of TV) is M, R's best friend, if there even IS such a thing in the zombie world.

All of us were involved in this upbeat comedy from the get-go. We were surprised the first time we laughed because of the dystopian setting, but got the hang of it very quickly.

Expect a circumspect courtship, lots of gunshots and blood, very little vehicular mayhem or profanity and NO blowie uppie stuff.

Just suspend disbelief and have a good time! Amazon will tell me when I can order my DVD.",1358380800,127,1978,4.7368421052631575

5511710,4,B00AW9M54I,"Young R (Nicholas Hoult) has eyes for Julie (Teresa Palmer). But Julie is preoccupied with fighting zombies in a post-apocalyptic world.  The catch:  R is a zombie.  Can this budding romance happen?

Warm Bodies is a clever variation on the endless stream of zombie films that have proliferated recently on screens big and small.  There have been horror spoofs a-plenty, but this one may be the first zombie fairy tale.

Like his fellow zombies, R must feed on the brains of the living to survive.  By ingesting brains, a zombie also experiences the memories of his victim.  R has just chowed down on Perry (Dave Franco), Julies boyfriend, and begins to see memories of the couples life together.  R is smitten with Julie, but whats a boy -- especially a dead one -- to do when the human beings, led by Julies father, Grigio (John Malkovich), are intent on blowing his brains out?  And can Julie possibly fall for a dead predator?

One of the biggest problems R faces is protecting Julie from the zombie hordes.  He does this by smearing blood on her to mask her human smell so she can walk freely among them.

Director Jonathan Levine has fashioned a witty reimagining of the zombie flick -- a Twilight of sorts for people who love a good romantic tale, however odd.

Mr. Hoult (X-Men: First Class, Clash of the Titans) is appealing as the lovesick R. Because a zombie has no memory of its own and can hardly speak, the only thing he can utter when Julie asks his name is Arrrr, hence R. Hoult does his zombie shuffle convincingly and is just pale enough with some skin discolorations and scars to make him creepy but not altogether repugnant. In one scene, R amusingly mimics the natural, loose walk of a human. We can see why Julie eventually warms to his cold body.

There are borrowings or influences from many sources, starting with Romeo and Juliet (and a balcony scene) and extending through every dystopian movie ever made.  Rs on-screen narration gets us painlessly through information we don't really care about, such as how the world came to such a state, and relates the inner feelings of R as he falls under the spell of Julie.

There are inconsistencies that will bother zombie purists.  Depicted as slow-moving creatures, the zombies in Warm Bodies  occasionally move very quickly.  And Julie seems awfully forgiving, given that R has just ripped open her boyfriends skull and feasted on his brains.

Despite the movies brief running time, there are moments when the pace bogs down.  For the most part, however, director Levine moves us briskly through Rs journey.

Rated PG-13, Warm Bodies is a sweet picture despite its gruesome trappings.  Its tough to make an essentially mute character register with a personality of its own, but Hoult and Levine accomplish this both touchingly and amusingly.

5511752,4,B00AW9M54I,"This is a surprisingly good film. At first glance it seems like a typical post-apocalyptic, YA romance flick --and to some degree it is.  However, if you look beyond the surface, there is much more depth to the story.  A relatively faithful adaptation of the novel (same title) by Isaac Marion, the plot centers on two characters, R and Julie, in an admittedly not-so-subtle nod to Shakespeare.  R (who cant remember his full name thanks to zombie brain fuzz) is a zombie who develops feelings for Julie, the human daughter of the aggressive leader of the surviving human clan. This story is less about a quirky romance, though, than it is a social commentary on modern life.  Their post-apocalyptic world of alienation, intolerance, fear, violence, and emptiness bears a striking (metaphoric) resemblance to our own.  In their world, the struggle for survival for either side (zombie/human) comes with the loss of life and soul.  At many points in the story, one begins to question what it means to be human, to truly 'have a heart.' As the zombies regain their memories and soul, the lines between them and the atavistic, primal humans become blurred. The concept of humanity must be re-defined. Basically, the bleakness of their empty, violent world mirrors the waste land of our own contemporary society.  If humanity is to survive, the paradigm must shift.

Granted, this is not a particularly innovative theme, but I do appreciate the perspective from which the landscape is surveyed.  Most stories like this are told from the viewpoint of an omniscient narrator or a human eye. But this storyin both novel and filmis filtered through the lens of a zombie, which ironically offers a sweet warmth to the narration.  To that end, Nicholas Hoult does a marvelous job in playing a surprisingly complex, relatable character. He depicts Rs physical/emotional evolution with subtlety and care. Any actor that can make you fall in love with a member of the cannibalistic undead is a fine actor, in my opinion.  And how could you not love a zombie with dry wit, a conficted conscience, a fondness for 80s pop music, and an awkward crush on a pretty blond? On that note, Theresa Palmers portrayal of Julie is fine but unremarkable. That role could have been played to the same degree by at least 50 other actresses, I think. John Malkovich makes a fun, surprising cameo as Julies rigid, domineering father. While his is certainly no Oscar-winning performance, he is always entertaining. And watching Rob Corddry channel his inner zombie (as R's BFF) is a treat in itself. Be warned that there are some graphic, brain-munching scenes (it IS a zombie movie, after all), but if you can get past the yuck factor, youll appreciate the treasure of a story about finding life and love amidst the bleak carnage of the modern world.

Warm Bodies is not an epic film by any means, but I cant help but adore it. I highly recommend you read the book as well. I watched the movie, then read the book out of curiosity. Then when I watched the movie a second time, it clicked. If you are willing to embrace the fantasy, overlook inconsistencies, and excavate the meaning of the story, youll find an intriguing film with a lot of heart (pardon the pun).  Enjoy!",1502668800,,3241,4.807553956834532

5511844,5,B00AW9M54I,"The movie blew me away. I went into Warm Bodies expecting a silly movie that was fun to watch, but not GOOD. What I got was great acting, spot-on soundtrack choices, an actual story-line to care about, heavy character development, and real humor (to be fair, there were a COUPLE cheap laughs, but only after the movie established itself as actually funny). I've had my eye on Nicholas Hoult since seeing him as a kid in About a Boy; he's only gotten better since, instead of losing his talent with puberty and life experience (Nux in Fury Road, anyone?? This man can ACT).

The opening narration doesn't really establish the tone of the movie, as that could either be a positive or negative depending on how it's pulled off. This case is definitely positive. We immediately get to know exactly who we're dealing with, and just how much thought he's capable of at the time. Given the source material, I really think it's the only plausible route; you can obviously portray a lot without words, but his somehow calm/manic thought processes need to be heard (which might be a different case with someone less talented). I should be clear that the movie CAN get a bit silly at times, but for me it's just too easy to forgive.",1495152000,3,1221,4.60091743119266

5512517,4,B00AW9M54I,"I thought this was an enjoyable movie. I think what amused me the most was that I went looking through past (professional) reviews after I saw it to see if there was any mention of what was practically screaming at me the entire time I watched it. Nope, not a one mentioned the fact that THIS IS ROMEO AND JULIET!

WITH ZOMBIES!!!

I mean the guy even calls himself R, there are two warring factions that hate each other, and the girl, well I forget her name, but isn't it a derivative of Juliet?

I homeschool and my oldest son, who is high school age, is studying Shakespeare this year. We just finished Romeo and Juliet and I am going to show him the Zefferelli movie that we all watched in high school. Then we are going to watch this for fun. I am going to have him find all of the parallels with the original story",1475107200,,820,4.210191082802548

5512626,4,B00AW9M54I,This review is of the movie 'Warm Bodies' and this review is strictly the opinion of the author. This movie is a great comic zombie story that makes fun of movies that feature sparkly vampires and teenage brain-dead lead characters. It features romance between a zombie and a zombie fighter. Who knew that you could fall in love with a corpse?,1469491200,,343,4.639344262295082
5512627,5,B00AW9M54I,It met all my expectations. This is one movie that I liked better than the book. I mean why would a zombie fall in love with someone when he's got a wife and kids like in the book and the dad died in the book before he could shoot R. R bled from the knife that Julie threw at him. So in my opinion if you don't want to be confused out of your mind. Watch the movie and just watch the movie. It has John Malkovich what more do you want?,1469404800,,435,3.739130434782609

My wife and teen-aged children talked me into this movie, and I confess I watched it with no small amount of skepticism. A zombie love story? Really?

Yes really. This odd little movie is scary, violent, tense and suspenseful, but also warm, very funny, and ridiculously (but not syrupy) sweet. I can't say much more without spoiling things, but if you like a movie that tells certain kinds of stories from different angles, you'll probably like ""Warm Bodies"".

A word regarding the violence: there's not a lot of it, but what there is is kinda gruesome. Something to keep in mind if you have little ones in the room. Otherwise I'd very definitely recommend ""Warm Bodies.""",1461542400,,718,4.774193548387097

I like what Nick said that while making this movie he decided that zombies wouldn't blink... watch for it... he doesn't blink through the movie until the end.  So cute.  There's only a couple jumpy moments; it's cute and a love story.

At first we watched it as my Son, a Zombie fan, wanted to but I thought it was actually very well done overall and I was quite surprised. I would give it a solid 4.5 stars but since that is not an option I am rounding up. Were there some unbelievable parts, sure, but was it overall worthy of a watch? Absolutely.

Would I watch it again if it were on, likely. Not going out of my way to watch it a second time. Is it as good as say ""Artificial Intelligence"" (A.I.) not that good (phenomenal film BTW) but much better than I thought (I thought it would be a 2 star film initially).",1438646400,,630,4.04

Even World War Z is more interesting, coherent and ""believable"". Warm bodies is boring, pointless, ludicrous ( not funny), cheesy and predictable. I guess, this is a lame excuse to immitate Twighlight but for zombies.

Yet lets not be too hasty in our initial critical reactions to the storyline: the film works within the skeletal framework of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet (not a bad thing). The teen lovers are played by Nicholas Hoult (who doesn't overplay the Romeo-part for a change) and Teresa Palmer (a nice alternative to Kristen Stewart haters). These two young talents have actual chemistry and look poised for future success. Also, the screenwriters and supporting actor Rob Corddry deserve credit for they do an excellent job of at finding subtle humor in many scenes. However, the film does falter a bit with an over-zealous John Malkovich, an annoying Analeigh Tipton, and a weak Dave Franco. These characters tend to talk too much and think too little.

While it probably has some flows, and the end is clear from the beginning, the overall enjoyment of watching this movie renders that irrelevant.

5514918,4,B00AW9M54I,"Warm Bodies
 Warm Bodies is a full bore $30 million production with some snappy writing, professional direction and acting that is certainly good enough for the genre.  It is also a love story/Zombie flick.  I liked it a lot but my movie buddies this week found it silly, laughable even and not worthy of either their time or admission ticket.  They are grownups.  Other grownups might not like this one.  For Zombie fanciers like me and others either young or young at heart- read on.
 This is a reworking of Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet.  The eternal themes of young love and tragedy never grow old.  Julie (26 year old Australian Teresa Palmer who believably plays below her age) is the daughter of the leader of the leader of a city of humans who have survived the Zombie Apocalypse.  Palmer has had a dozen or so big screen appearances including a major role in The Sorcerers Apprentice.  Her dad is played with malevolent intensity by John Malkovich.  23 year old Englishman and emerging heart throb Nicholas Hoult is her Zombie boy friend.  When they meet he cannot speak his own name, not being able to get past R, so Julie tags him R.
 I prefer my Zombies to be the traditional jerky shufflers and that tradition is honored here.  There is an innovation which I rather liked, the Boneies.  The Boneies are undead whose flesh has fallen away leaving only muscle and bone.  These guys are fast and vicious.  We discover as the film unwinds that in-the words of Billy Chrystal-the Zombies are merely mostly dead.  There is a spark of humanity left in their rotting carcasses.  It takes only a spark of true love to bring that spark into flame.
 Writer/Director Jonathan Levine also both wrote and directed the funny and moving 50/50.  This film was about the life of a young cancer victim, a very tough subject.  In Warm Bodies he inserts occasional spurts of teen-speak into the mouths of his young actors that startled me into laughter more than once.
 This is a PG-13 rated film but Zombies devouring human brains is not for the squeamish.  There are however no naked people either living or not so much.  The producers are rubbing their greedy little hands together at the films financial success.  It has brought in $73 million so far in worldwide box office sales and seems to have a ways to go.  The film is one hour and 37 minutes long which makes for a quick in and out.
 In the realm of Zombie flicks, this one rates a solid three brains.  As a main stream movie, it gets a subpar two saw blades.  We enter some rare territory here with a Zombie/Human love story, something only seen obliquely in the fine American Zombies.  I love a love story.
 A remake of the Bruce Campbell classic Evil Dead hits theaters in April followed by World War Z, a huge Brad Pitt production, in June.  Zombie fans be glad.",1425772800,,2820,4.562874251497006

What did I think?

What may have been intended as Romeo & Juliet with Zombies turns out to be more Zombie Twilight with an intentional sense of humor. But this zom-rom-com combo leaves you not really caring about the characters or the fate of the human race.

Jonathan Levine at least capably directs likeable leads Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer away from vapid Edward-and-Bella territory. But when it comes to the undead-related laughs, its no Shaun of the Dead.",1423958400,,745,4.796875

I didn't far into the plot to really see anything more than setting establishment. Still starting from the zombies' perspective, I guess, was to generate sympathy which it did in a way I'm uncertain the creators wanted.

I really wasn't expecting this movie to be so......cute.  I'm sorry, but that's the best way to describe it.  It gave me warm fuzzies and is definitely worth the few bucks to buy this movie.  For some reason I seem to kinda have a crush on Nicolas Hoult who plays 'R'.  I haven't seen him in anything before this movie and he reminds me of a (young, hot, non-crazy) Tom Cruise.  You know the Tom Cruise in Risky Business and Top Gun.....before he went off the rails.  But, I digress......

This movie is really more of a love story than a zombie flick, but if you have a sci-fi nut like me that really won't go and rent a chick flick, then it's a good substitute.  It has enough Zombie stuff to keep the sci-fi geek entertained and also has lots of funny parts too, with a plot that moves along at a nice pace.  I really wasn't expecting to like it as much as I do.  I can't help but keep re-watching it.  Oh, it has some cool music in it too.....  So why did I like it so much?

5515782,5,B00AW9M54I,"Based on the book by Isaac Marion, Warm Bodies is a delightful romantic comedy about the healing power of love, even after death.

R (Nicholas Hoult) is a just your average dead guy walking around in a world full of zombies. He lives in, er, inhabits an abandoned airport with a lot of other zombies and most of the time, they just kind of shuffle along, looking at each other, unable to talk. He and his best friend, M, like to sit at the airport bar grunting to each other, and in his free time, R enjoys hanging out in an old jet, collecting stuff and listening to tunes.

Through internal dialogue, R gives us a nice glimpse into his world and what he thinks of it. Probably the biggest bummer, aside from his inability to remember much of anything about his former life, is knowing that eventually, all the zombies end up turning into these mean skeleton figures referred to as ""bonies"". The bonies really are truly terrifying. Hungry for human flesh, they are fast and mean and relentless - zombies who have given up all semblance of being human.

The humans that are left have blockaded themselves behind a large wall and they are doing their best to survive, but it isn't looking good for them. Between the zombies and the bonies, the humans are seriously outnumbered. Their leader is Grigio (John Malkovich) a man who is doing his best to survive but after losing his wife (and other loved ones) to the zombies, he has become pretty cut off from emotional relationships.

Julie (Teresa Palmer) is Grigio's daughter and she and a group of her compatriots, including her love interest Perry (Dave Franco) head out for supplies, armed against the zombies. Unfortunately, they meet up with R and his zombie companions, out in search of food. In the battle that ensues, the humans don't fair so well and several of them die. R kills Perry, and while eating his brain, he takes on Perry's memories, including his love for Julie.

Something strange happens to R when he sees Julie for the first time. She has an effect on him like no other, and suddenly, his long dead heart BEATS. Instead of killing her, he saves her, smearing her with ""dead matter"" to hide her living smell and smuggling her back to the airport with him, ""to keep her safe."" They spend several days together and it transforms them both - and then, it begins a transformation far beyond themselves.

I really enjoyed this movie. It is quite funny, often in a rather dry and tongue-in-cheek way I enjoyed a lot. While not at all scary, there are moments that provide enough tension to remind you that you really are watching a zombie movie.

I found myself wishing, at times, that we knew more back story about some of the characters, but that was a minor issue for the most part. Mostly, this was just a delightful, humorous, and touching love story that was quite unique in form. I believe that Warm Bodies will soon become a permanent part of my personal DVD collection because I know I will want to see it again.

If you're looking for a good date night movie, especially around Halloween, Warm Bodies is a great choice!",1413158400,,3094,4.572202166064982
5515783,3,B00AW9M54I,"The concept was more or less unique as zombie movies go, but the timing in the film was off. Part of being a zombie is the ability to kil without remorse or regret. A person with any remorse or regret at all would cease to be a zombie, so the lead character should not have killed people when he was able to think and reason. We should have seen him kill, then have his awakening and stop killing. He killed the boyfriend of the girl and ate his brain after he was aware of his action, therefore he was a murderer. All in all, the movie was enjoyable, even with that rather major plot hole.",1413158400,,590,4.139130434782609

However, the story is set on a girl who was essentially saved by a zombie who fell in love with her.  The girl is paranoid at first, believing that her life is gone, especially when she finds herself being stared at by the zombie.  She eventually finds herself to get out of the suburban area and back into the city, where she is confronted by her worried family.  The zombie finds her and expresses his eternal devotion to her, even though he is a zombie.

Just about perfect, except for the typical rom-com problem of the girl just not being interesting or lovable enough to inspire such devotion.",1400457600,,439,5.3768115942028984
5516183,3,B00AW9M54I,"Warm Bodies is, on the surface, a transplant of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet into a zombie apocalypse. Two young people seem completely incompatible when they meet because they are from wildly different groups: he's a zombie, she's a human. She is with a group of young people scavenging supplies outside of the humans' walled-off city that is attacked by a group of zombies scavenging for brains. He's with the zombie group but is immediately taken by the sight of her (but after he eats her boyfriend). He helps her escape back to his home at an airport, where a lot of zombies shuffle around like the humans did years before. She lays low there and starts to appreciate him.

His saving her is certainly odd for a zombie movie but the zombie mythology here is a bit different from the standard. The movie starts at the airport with him going through his daily routine of aimless wandering. While he does this, he provides a highly-articulate voice-over narration of his life and his memories, such as they are. He can't remember his name but thinks it began with an ""r"" so he goes through the movie as R. He can grunt and occasionally speak a word or two. He goes out with some fellow zombies on the above mentioned raid. Instead of his heart skipping a beat when he sees Julie, his heart has a beat. His physical heart grows stronger the longer he stays with her and he begins to speak more words, even sentences. Could this be the zombie cure?

The other big difference from standard zombie lore is the two classes of zombies. First are the high-functioning, still human-looking zombies like R, who do have an internal mental process (the voice-over shows it in R's case and zombies like him have similar behavior). Second are the bonies, zombies who are blackened husks of their former human selves. They are vicious and unreasoning and eat anything that has a heartbeat. They are too far gone to be cured and turn on the first set of zombies when they show signs of a cure, i.e. heartbeats. The bonies are generic bad guys who are scary enough for a PG-13 movie.

If you know Romeo and Juliet or one of its many imitators, the plot has no surprises. The departures from zombie lore are more surprising and interesting than the romantic plot. The performances are okay. John Malkovich plays Julie's father and he seems to be phoning it in for most of the movie. The two main characters are charming enough to keep the story going but are not outstanding. It was a mildly enjoyable film.

Parental advisory: some language; very brief scenes of zombies eating people; shooting of both kinds of zombies but not with much blood or gore; some peeling/wounded zombies; a quick shot of Julie in her underwear from behind; some kissing.",1400371200,,2736,4.646694214876033
5516184,5,B00AW9M54I,"Oddly enough, this is NOT a zombie movie. It has some lurching undead in it of course but you must see this film to figure out what it really is. [Ok, I'm a show off - I put the complete SPOILER in the comments section - see the movie first though!]

Much of the film is internally self-narrated by 'R', Our Hero. His narration is delightfully droll, the courtship of Julie narration pays the price of admission all by itself (admonishing himself, ""Don't be weird!""). Nicholas Hoult does a terrific job of showing actual emotion whilst trapped in his emotionless zombified corpse condition, no mean feat for a young actor. John Malkovitch, as always, turns in a huge performance in a small role which rounds out the film beautifully.

I didn't want to watch this movie since I've had my fill of the whole zombie-thing but I am so glad I did. It's apocalyptic, humorous, romantic and has a few reasonably scary moments. See this movie - it's worth it!",1400198400,,950,4.58235294117647

I mean, come on, it has John Malcovitch (sp?) in a zombie movie.  How great is that?  It's not so much a 'world ends by zombies' movie, as a 'world starts over' movie.  I'm really trying to not spoil it, so just watch it if you get the chance, because it has a definate sense of humor, along with zombies.  Really really great!",1400025600,,664,4.306451612903226
5516186,4,B00AW9M54I,"Warm bodies is a sweet, funny romantic comedy with zombies. I have never read the book so I cannot comment as to how good it is as an adaptation. However, as a standalone movie I really enjoyed it. The story is pretty obviously a loose retelling of Romeo and Juliet. ""R"" is a zombie that just wants to feel something again, Julie is a very much alive young woman who is fighting for survival during a zombie apocalypse. As ""R"" attempts to spend more time with Julie, he becomes more human, and Julie encouraged by the changes she is seeing in ""R"" attempts to get her friends and family to accept him despite the fact that he is ""the enemy"".

5516191,5,B00AW9M54I,"I just discovered this movie two weeks ago, and I've watched it 10-15 times since then, so yeah, I like it.  A lot.  R's internal monologues are wonderful at humanizing him, explaining his world and his limitations.  ""This is my best friend.  By best friend, I mean we occasionally grunt and stare awkwardly at each other.""  Julie is kick-ass; even if she can't fight off dozen zombies all by herself, she does a lot better than any of the other of her zombie-bait companions.  She takes risks, she has hope, she's the perfect person to want to find out what's going on inside a zombie's head.

The soundtrack is fabulous, and I love the way they use it.  Some of the lyrics are practically dialog, because R uses music to communicate some of the things he can't say to Julie.  The music when he first lays eyes on her cracks me up every time.  Nicholas Hoult does an amazing job of communicating with his eyes and facial expressions, while keeping most of his body language convincingly zombie-ish.

For the record, R was in love with Julie from the second he saw her.  Eating her ex-boyfriend's brain just helped him (and us) get to know her (and Perry) better, and it's an important plot point towards the end.  There wasn't as much interaction between R and Perry as there was in the book, but they did get some of it in there.

The movie necessarily simplified and smoothed out some of the aspects of the book, but I think it worked well.  The ending worked because it was a logical progression of what we'd seen.  Julie wasn't the cure to the plague, it was the two of them together, and it had been happening all along.  And did I mention it's really funny?  R gets most of the good lines, but it really is his story, for the most part.

It's like the tag line from some of the posters:  He's still dead, but he's getting warmer!",1398470400,,1836,4.407738095238095
5516192,3,B00AW9M54I,"I listened to a review of this movie on NPR several months ago and was excited to see a fresh new take on the old, overused story.

This movie features a main zombie character, R, who wanders around an airport with his zombie friends. Thing is, he starts having thoughts besides eating brains and walking. He is dealing with this when he comes across Julie, a human whose dad is in charge barricading himself and the few remaining humans left. R develops feelings for Julie after eating her boyfriend's brains, which allow R to experience all of the memories. R decides to take Julie back to his place, a grounded plane, and keeps her safe from his friends. After a while she yearns for home, and they make the trip back to the compound.

The ending of this movie was much better than the beginning. Pacing was definitely a problem, as the first 10 minutes felt like an hour, while the last 30 to 60 seemed like 10. I almost turned it off because there was not enough going on to keep me interested, but dealt with it as things slowly picked up.

In this universe there are three types: Humans, zombies, and skeletons (bonies). The humans and zombies eventually join forces to defeat the bonies. Once the bonies are gone, the zombies somehow ignore their need to feed on human brains and instead live peaceably among them. I wasn't a big fan of this portion as they conveniently neglected to explain how this arrangement would work. The zombies would eventually need to eat SOMETHING, but there is no mention what.",1398124800,,1514,4.5793357933579335

5516222,5,B00AW9M54I,"- R: ""I can't remember my name, or my parents, or my job. Although my hoodie would suggest I was unemployed.""

I don't know that WARM BODIES reinvents the zombie genre. The back of my brain asserts that somewhen before was a similar premise. Diehard zombie purists should maybe stay away from this one lest they suffer a string of apoplexies. Me, I appreciate what WARM BODIES was going for, appreciate its going out on a limb. A zombie flick with a warm beating heart? Refreshing.

Uniquely, our point-of-entry character is a rotter. Eight years into the zombie apocalypse, 'R' can't recall much of his past life. He posits that his name may start with an 'R'. We're right away alerted to the film's central conceit - that there may yet be a vestige of life, a spark of awareness, in these shambling revenants. R's wry internal monologue informs us of his loneliness and general sense of ennui and his regret at having to munch on humans but that, hey, he's gotta do what he's gotta do.

Everything changes when R saves Julie (Teresa Palmer), a human girl out foraging, from an attack from his ghoulish peeps. The relationship they then fashion sets into motion events that irrevocably reshapes their post-apocalyptic world. That's if Julie's overprotective, militant dad (John Malkovich) doesn't fire a slug into R's brain. I know, right? Dads.

If I had to bag on the movie, it'd be that Malkovich is woefully underused in it. Malkovich should've been allowed to dig deeper into his bag of tricks.

WARM BODIES is very much a zombie comedy, and well-constructed. It does hold back on the gore, so the gorehounds will walk away seething. But I really liked it. Not only did I care about R and Julie, but I also grew invested in two ancillary characters - Julie's jaunty best pal Nora (Analeigh Tipton) and R's best undead pal M (Rob Corddry), with whom R engages in sessions of guttural ""dialogue"" at the airport bar. Corddry, in particular, is so good at what he does, it's gratifying that Jonathan Levine, who directed and wrote the screenplay, bestows upon M his own transformative story arc.

And to present an alternative flavor, there's the action element. As R gradually continues to evolve and we glimpse a glimmer of hope, after all, there at the horizon for what's left of humanity, there is, as well, an escalation in dread and suspense as man's last outpost is threatened to be overrun by the Boneys, these skeletal reflections of the still fleshy zombies. Boneys are zombies who'd fully surrendered to despair and had sloughed off their skin and are become even more terrifying predators. In this undead hierarchy, regular zombies aren't the top-of-the-food chain alphas. In the DVD's bonus features, Nicholas Hoult describes the Boneys as ""kind of like the bullies at school."" Heh.

If you've a literary bone in you, the allusions to Romeo & Juliet can't have passed unnoticed. At its most obvious, there are the two lead characters' names. There is even a balcony scene. I don't think anyone's trying to be subtle about it. A zombie story with Shakespearean underpinnings? I think the good folks at Merchant Ivory just developed their own boneys.

It's cold to pan a movie that takes risks, so I won't. Besides, WARM BODIES took bold risks that mostly paid off. I relished the offbeat elements, the quirky humor that was individual to this film. It's good times whenever R tries to communicate with Julie only to be continuously trapped and frustrated by clichd ""zombie speak."" There's hilarity but also pathos brought about by this dichotomy - of R's precise internal articulation versus his sad stabs at vocalization. Perhaps one of the film's best lines spools out of one such mortifying moment as R laments: ""This date is not going well. I want to die all over again.""

Nicholas Hoult does a bang-up job of capturing the all-too-human awkwardness of crushing on someone even as he retains enough believability to sell his walking dead bits. Hoult projects a wistfulness and a way of being still that lend themselves well to the uniqueness of his zombie character. I wish he were even more in an advanced state of decay, but, hey, you have to give Julie something to work with. He couldn't be too revolting. Teresa Palmer, who was so badass as Six in I AM NUMBER FOUR, gets moments to show that she's still a captivating onscreen presence and still a girl to be reckoned with. And, yes, the bulk of the film's very best moments center around Julie and R interacting. It's such a peculiar love story, and I did spend much of the film wondering how in hell they were going to pull it off. How they pull it off is just one more grace note in a film that doesn't shy away from breaking conventions. A dead boy on a quest for true love, abetted by a kickass soundtrack? Yeah, man, I'm down.

5516291,5,B00AW9M54I,"I saw this in theaters when it came out because I am a huge fan of anything zombie oriented. I absolutely love it, such a unique take on the zombie type film. It starts out almost like any other normal zombie movie with blood, gore and death but instead of following a human character it continues the movie through the zombie perspective.
It is very lighthearted and not the most serious movie, if I had to categorize it I would put in Comedy/Horror/Romance. Very hilarious and super cheesy at times, but I loved every minute of this movie.
If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it as well as the purchase!",1395360000,,611,4.464285714285714
5516292,5,B00AW9M54I,"Zombie movies are awesome, but let's be honest- this genre has been beaten to hell over the past couple of years. Zombie movies, zombie shows, fast zombies, slow zombies, medical zombies, don't know why zombies... it's been a lot of misses with a couple of hits. This is a hit.
Warm Bodies has the subtle sarcastic humor in the vein of Zombieland, but focuses on the plight of the zombie. Hoult delivers fantastically as the sensitive undead protagonist. The fact that the origin of the zombie apocalypse isn't identifiable due to your hero being unable to remember because he's slowly deteriorating is awesome. The storyline's great, simplistic but great. Don't hold your breath for special effects- the cgi is obvious and choppy. But the acting's spot on- though I don't like Malkovich being so uptight. I prefer his crazy self in RED.
This is my version of the perfect Valentine's Day movie- blood, guts, and a sappy love story. With a nice dose of sarcastic humor. Perfection.",1395273600,2,980,4.874251497005988

This is the only book I have ever read that is so unique because it is written from the zombie's perspective. Now onto the movie. I loved it!! It was very true to the book and the acting and setting was done just right. Nicholas Hoult and Rob Cordry are fantastic actors and the lead actress Teresa Palmer was spot on. She reminds me of a prettier Kristen Stewart who can actually act. The sound track is also awesome!! believe it or not this a very much a feel good movie. So few movies adapted to books these day are worth watching but this one definitely is. Enjoy!! And if you haven't read the book yet read it!!,1394323200,,761,4.183673469387755

5516330,3,B00AW9M54I,"I am not a fan of zombie movies. Vampires and werewolves, maybe, but I draw the line at zombies. ;-) That said, this was highly recommended somewhere. So I borrowed it.

It was entertaining, but not something I'll think about tomorrow. The boy meets girl plot is made a bit more original by having one party be a corpse. The plot of the story requires you to suspend more belief than usual. I can't say why without spoiling the movie. The really bad zombies are called Boneys. Corpses are like the boy in love, and more normal-looking than the boneys. The boneys are obviously computer-generated, but that doesn't bother me as much as it will some.

So it's OK for light entertainment, but I wouldn't watch it again.",1394064000,,716,4.5859375

This will soon be a classic film for many and a great additive to any zombie genre collection.

R has a wide variety of facial expressions that make me smile and convey his feelings pretty well (which is a good thing because there isn't a whole lot of actual talking on his part). The acting for the most part was pretty good, but there were some parts where it just didn't feel right, like over acted. I'd mention them, but I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone.

I don't know that you needed the backing of Summit to make this one as great as it turned out to be, but it was in fact great. Every little wink, nod and shoulder shrug meant something in this film. Can you remember watching a movie and noticing a character's tics? I was very impressed with the production, the lack of dull moments, and most of all the lead actor. Most actors would probably kill to play a zombie, because it requires no emotion - but guess what; this zombie has to go from no emotion to completely enlightened in the span of the film. And he someone pulls it off, as we smile all the way along. I could nitpick, but why? Not when it's clear so much thought was put into making this not at all average movie.

5516471,4,B00AW9M54I,"There have been innumerable zombie movies.  There have been quite a few movies in
which a monster (most often a vampire; sometimes of other kinds) falls in love with a
human.  I think this is the first movie I've ever seen in which a zombie falls in love with
a live female.  A first movie I've seen, told from the zombie's perspective.  And it's in the
very rare genre of zombie-comedy-ROMANCE films (closest to it maybe is Zombieland,
but there any romance was between the living).

Look for the classical reference in the movie.  Perhaps you'll see it way in advance.
As for me, it caught me by surprise but as soon as it happened, I realized the reference.

This unique combination of suspense, comedy and ultimately romance, is at its most
basic, a love story; a futuristic, sci-fi/horror kind of love story.  Rob Corddry also plays
a zombie.  It's got a lot of ""slacker finding a purpose"" sort of feel to it as well.  I was
pleasantly surprised.  Nothing requiring any hard thought, but quite a bit of fun.",1391385600,,1012,4.566666666666666

5516861,2,B00AW9M54I,"TL;DR - if you want Blu-Ray plus DVD plus digital, THIS IS NOT THE PRODUCT YOU WANT.

**No Spoilers**

To begin: The movie is worth a rating of at least 4 stars, maybe even 5 stars. I've read the book it is based upon, and can honestly say that both are great. It is interesting to see what was changed, switched around, and omitted for the adaptation to cinema. The movie is lighter and more comedic, rarely dipping into deeper waters, and is not especially gory; the novel is darker, more explicit, more verbose (delightfully so for an advanced reader), and dives right in to the psychological environment that would exist in such a post-apocalyptic world. The novel, unlike the movie, does give actual detail of the plague and the cure.

We all know how favorably we look upon movie adaptations and book adaptations - one is good and the other sucks, and which one we saw/read first typically dictates that we'll like the one we saw/read second much less. This is not the case for ""Warm Bodies."" The movie and the novel are different... and that's okay. I don't think I've felt this way since the movie adaptation of Roald Dahl's ""Matilda.""

The special features for Warm Bodies are worth watching. My particular favorite was the gag reel of bloopers - anyone who is familiar with iPhone's Siri will understand why.

So, why the 3 stars? The packaging/bundle itself.

I take responsibility for not reading more carefully. However, I think anyone will understand how sometimes our brains fill in or misrepresent what we're actually seeing. I purchased this product on Black Friday when it and other movie DVDs were on sale for an hour each. It was surrounded by movies packaged as ""Blu-Ray + DVD + Digital Copy."" I'd never before seen ""Blu-Ray + Digital Copy + Ultraviolet"" (yes, I need to get out more) and my brain must've been confused.

The gift was intended to be split between siblings - some who have a Blu-ray capable player and some who live elsewhere and only use a regular DVD player. This was impossible to do thanks to the digital copy that is *only* available for download through iTunes and can only be played via iTunes due to Apple's proprietary .m4v file format and encoding. Want to play it somewhere other than your PC? Too bad. Want to burn it off and give the copy to someone who doesn't have and does not desire an iTunes account? So sad. (The digital copy would have been deleted from my computer, so I wasn't intending to make 'new' copies.) DRM (Digital Rights Management), pushing legitimate customers to The Pirate Bay since its inception.

Ultraviolet as a product feature is a joke. It's advertised as allowing the consumer to stream the movie to multiple devices. There are two major problems with this:

1) Stored in the cloud, so to speak, but inferior to actually storing something in the cloud. Movie studios each have their own websites that manages these 'ultraviolet' copies. Great for them, not so great for us. Can you imagine the inconvenience of an online movie collection that's split between different managers? Yikes. (To be fair to the movie studios, there are perfectly logical and sound reasons for implementing it in that manner - but the whole idea of 'ultraviolet' movie copies needs to be junked. It's inherently flawed.)

2) Access. As mentioned in the first point, UV copies are stored across multiple differing web sites operated by different movie studios. Not convenient. Also, we typically only get access to the UV copy for a year. Considering that I can set up my own devices for streaming, I may as well take the part of the price of the DVD that pays for such access and burn it in a campfire. At least I'd get something slightly useful out of it.",1388361600,,3711,4.695384615384615

5516924,5,B00AW9M54I,"I am not much of a zombie-apocalypse, end of world kind of person, but I personally was very anxious for this particular movie to come to Amazon. I got it immediately. Now, this is no average zombie movie. It can actually appeal to both genders, considering that it has the whole zombie thing. But the love story is not too cutesy or overpowering. Also, it pretty much hits every must in the zombie movie category:

1) a plot that can actually engage watchers. If it has no plot, what's the point?
2) good action scenes. I have seen way to many zombie movies with unrealistic chase scenes.  In this movie you can tell the actors are actually running.
3) acting! The acting is frigging fantastic. I love the actors in this movie, they fit the roles very well.
4) scenery is a must. You can't have a lame post-apocalyptic world with bad scenery.
5) graphics are absolutely great in this movie. Not to many, but well done

Warm Bodies also has a romantic comedy thrown in with it. Every now atnd then a witty comment is said (by mostly Julie or R). They will make you laugh. I have seen some comments where they say that the zombies should not have functioning brains, that it is totally unorthodox compared to all other zombie movies and shows. Well guess what? This whole movie is unorthodox. I actually find the working brain very realistic. In a coma, a person will still have an active brain, so the movie's plauge actually is understandable, when others don't have realistic symptoms. So altogether, this movie is a cocktail of romantic comedy, zombie, and some good action, all blended well together into a movie that will touch anyone, and probably amaze you.

5516928,5,B00AW9M54I,"Zombie Type: Both slow-walking and fast-running undead

Outbreak/Apocalypse Phase: Post-outbreak apocalypse (outbreak has already occurred, characters are living through the zombie apocalypse)

Sub-Genre: Romantic Comedy (rom-zom-com)

This is the kind of movie that really freshens up an entire genre.  I wish I could talk more about the story, but I try to either leave these posts fairly spoiler-free or at least warn readers when Im about to spill some of the beans (brains?).
Warm Bodies is based on the Isaac Marion novel of the same name and centers around the relationship between R (a male zombie) and Julie (a female living human).  Seeing as how Ive already classified this as a romantic comedy, I think you can tell roughly where the story goes.  I enjoyed the relationship between the odd pairing, and the awkwardness that ensues when a girl catches a zombies fancy unsurprisingly leads to some funny moments.

What truly makes the story unique by zombie standards is MILD SPOILERS it is basically a retelling of Romeo and Juliet.  R is Romeo, J is Juliet, M is Mercutio, Perry is Paris, Julies dad hates all of zombie-kind, etc.  There are several scenes that reference Shakespeares classic, but Ill leave that for you guys to discover yourselves.  END SPOILERS

This movie was a huge pleasant surprise.  I expected it to be cheesy but decent enough to watch.  Instead, I found myself regarding this as probably one of my top ten favorite zombie films of all time.  The uniqueness of the story is only half of what makes it good; the other half is simply the fact that this is a solid, enjoyable movie.

Isaac Marion announced in 2012 that he is writing a sequel to the novel Warm Bodies.  Whether it is also adapted to the cinema screen remains to be seen, but I eagerly await the chance to watch the further evolution of his story.

Final Verdict: highly recommended not only for zombie fans, but also for anyone else looking for a good movie thats different than the usual undead fare.  Very unique zombie film!",1387584000,,2028,4.812138728323699

Like, for example, that zombies will sudden exist and come and eat me while I'm walking home.  Or those things from Pitch Black will be lurking in the shadows of my home.  However, I must say that I really liked this movie.  It's cute, refreshing and has a wonderfully original voice for the main character.

I was originally drawn to it because of the funny trailers featuring the main character ""R"" and his unique persepective on the world.  And although I spent the entire movie tense, sure that the heroine was going to be eaten by everyone at every moment, I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.

5517043,4,B00AW9M54I,"""Cold Body, Warm Heart"" seems a perfectly appropriate description for this movie.  I realize this was probably intended for the teen, zombie-loving market, but I think people of all ages can appreciate and enjoy it.  I'll admit that I decided to watch this movie because the teens that I teach recommended it.  I thought it would probably be silly and all teeny-bopper-y, much below my dignity, but I thought, well, it will give me something to talk to them about.  I was very pleasantly surprised at what a good movie it actually is.

It's set in the near future after some strange virus left a good portion of the world's population ""undead.""  Naturally, those who have not been infected have sealed themselves away from the others for their own protection.  In this movie, a normal girl has a chance encounter with dangerous zombies, one of whom eats her boyfriend's brain and develops the feelings for the girl that were housed there.  They're drawn together and love prevails over all, of course.

Obviously, this would be a great date movie for teens, but it seems a bit more than that, too.  It has a depth of symbolism that is intellectually satisfying as much as it is emotionally satisfying.  It's definitely worth watching if you want to believe in the power of love.",1384214400,4,1278,4.737556561085973

It takes a special film to make you stop the DVD about 20minutes into it  and want to break in it half,  then contemplate your life and lastly take your anger and frustration out on a punching bag or a person. I have only had this happen to me on 4 films, them being WARM BODIES, CLOSER with Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Natalie Portman and Jude law. SON OF THE MASK with Jamie kennedy,. lastly the Super Mario brothers movie. I Will be completely honest I only watched this because one of my Hollywood crushes was in it with Teresa palmer but she couldn't even save this movie. The lead played by Nicholas Hoult obviously went to the Jaden Smith school of acting which is to go through every scene of the film with a constipated dumb look on his face. I though Twilight was bad wait til you get a load of this . Anyone who follows the zombie genre will be devastated as this film pretty much sets its own rules as far as zombies go. really its the same thing that twilight did where everyone knows that vampires if they go in the sun will burn up but not in twilight they just glitter and stuff, same thing here most people who watch the walking dead or zombie movies know that once the virus hits you your dead that person you were is gone, but not in this film they act like your mind is still active  but your stuck in a  stage of purgatory like your body is doing things you don't have control over. the love story is really messed up the main character named R is a zombie he eats Teresa Palmers boyfriends brains  who is played by Dave Franco he sees his thoughts and of Teresa's character and his heart just starts pumping again  so lame. Most of the movie is about them spending time with each other and falling in love even tho she completely discounts that R eat her boyfriend, that's terrible.

In the trailer you see the zombie teaching the girl how to act like a zombie so as not to draw attention which I thought was hilarious but that was it.

5517149,4,B00AW9M54I,"Warm Bodies 4 stars...

I think it's maybe a 4 star movie. Almost one at least for it's originality and satire. On the cable's description, it's genres are comedy, sci-fi and horror. I didn't think this was a horror movie, but rather more a comedy satire movie. A satire to zombies and teen angst. Definitely a satire to teen angst. I was a little reluctant to watch this because of the possibility of being a horror movie. Now a days I get spooked pretty easily and was happy that this isn't a horror movie, but rather a little suspenseful.

The story was original and it was a little funny at times with R's commentary. I think Rob Corddy brought more comedy to the movie. The way he performed as a zombie was funny. Interesting that only he and R have talking roles as zombies - even ""exhumed zombies."" And there is a moral story to this. Maybe a bit of a spoiler. But this was obvious and predictable even if it was original. The way to ""exhume"" Earth and cure it of zombies is to teach them to learn to love and what it means to really be alive.

This was cute and I might be tempted to watch again some other time when I'm in the mood for a zombie comedy. Although, if I had to choose between this and Shaun of the Dead, I'd choose Shaun hands down.

I did like R's commentary and I think I wouldn't have watched the movie if it wasn't done the comedic way it was.
Oh and I liked how he even asked not to watch us eat the guy and that he was ashamed of it, making him seem more human than zombie.",1382313600,,1502,4.133561643835616

5517164,5,B00AW9M54I,"Warm Bodies is not your ordinary love story.  Well maybe it is, if you live in a zombie themed world.  Do you?  I sleepwalk but that probably doesn't count.  Anyway Warm Bodies is absolutely hilarious and often times unintentionally hilarious.  I mean come on, a young zombie man falls in love with a non-zombie woman he finds attractive and meets during a zombie strike?  He somehow struggles and fights through his seemingly permanent zombie ways and finds the strength to impress the girl of his liking, and I have to admit, the writing and characterization is good enough to impress me.  For a while it really *does* feel like a typical zombie thriller but with attempts for the young man to fight through and become normal all for the greater purpose of loving a girl.  Strange, isn't it?  Yup!

Of course that leads us to the ending... ahem!  Bad ending.  Sorry but it is.  You can't have happiness at the conclusion in a movie like this I'm afraid.  Implementing happiness would mean I'm supposed to take a loving relationship between a zombie and normal lady seriously and I just can't do that I'm afraid!  I suppose you'd have to feel compassion for a zombie in order to believe in any sense of love.  I just take the entire film as tongue in cheek, but the ending makes me think the writers were going for something bigger and more impactful.

Anyway I really like how the zombie guy holds the girl ""hostage"" and expresses his love in several different ways.  Of course all the girl really wants to do is get out of there and make a clean escape, but that's impossible due to the abundance of zombies everywhere.  Because the movie is so good and truthful to the zombie genre (in the beginning at least) you're still on edge and constantly wondering if the zombie guy will suddenly turn and bite the woman out of nowhere, and thus infect her.  I can't be the *only* one wondering if this would happen, right? I mean technically it's still a zombie movie, right?  Come on, I have to be right!  Let me be right. :)

I really enjoyed it.  It's a breathe of fresh air from other zombie movies that always seem to focus on hordes of them infecting victims/invading cities and the regular people have to defend themselves and their friends/family, etc.  This is an original idea here, and I support originality anytime over generic writing!

-GREAT MUSIC. I love the music for this movie, not only the instrumental background music but also the synthpop music used.
-GREAT ACTORS. The movie had several great main actors, but there were also many extras - zombies and humans! Each zombie had zombie makeup that was very well done.
-THE CHARACTERS. The characters were all very interesting and thought-out. (If you pay attention to the names of the characters, you will see that they resemble the names of characters from Romeo and Juliet! For example, R=Romeo, Julie=Juliet.)
-THE HUMOR. This movie had several moments that made me laugh out loud.
-THE STORYLINE. I call it a zom-rom-com. The story seems to be a dystopian version of Romeo and Juliet, if you think about it, with the names of the characters, as well as a forbidden love.

I HIGHLY recommend this movie. I have to warn you that there are several disturbing scenes, since this IS a zombie movie.",1381536000,,1058,4.597883597883598

It is your standard premise of zombies vs humanity, of course since it is a movie, both sides are exceptionally good looking even when they are not supposed to be.  The scenes are pretty text book but if you have picked out this sort of story you expect it to go the way it does before you even sit down to play it.

5517218,3,B00AW9M54I,"Somewhere in the post-apocalypse world, a zombie boy (Nicholas Hoult), who only remembers himself as ""R,"" falls in love with a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer). The romantic comedy with this outlandish premise is directed by Jonathan Levine of ""50/50"" fame. Though his curiously sweet ""zombie-meets-girl"" romance begins promisingly with effective offbeat humor, the film itself ends up with something more conventional than it should be.

Based on an Isaac Marion book, the story starts with a flesh-eating undead ""R"" who remembers nothing about himself. He thinks he shouldn't be doing what he is doing, but cannot change himself until one day, during the combat with humans, R falls in love with a girl Julie and saves her. Things get complicated when he learns that Julie is a daughter of Grigio (John Malkovich), leader of a zombie-hunting vigilante group.

The ""Romeo and Juliet""-like story (with a parody of the balcony scene) is told from the perspective of R, a zombie who seems to have some low-key sense of humor. The film is based on a concept that is stretched beyond its limits. Some of the processes R and other zombies go through are not explained. John Malkovich is wasted in an underwritten role. The players did great jobs, with a memorable support by Rob Corddry as R's friend M, but CG effects of some zombies need more improvements.

""Warm Bodies"" starts out as a unique blend of rom-com and zombie genres, but by the time the film reached the third act it starts to feel padded.",1380844800,,1500,4.8515625

5517253,3,B00AW9M54I,"Ah a love story that proves you ""R"" what you eat. Taken f from the original story of Capulet and Montague - revised as ""R"" and Julie.

Before you get the feeling that this is just another cross-species love story you find it also an action movie with a fast car and guns. There is some nice music; too bad that they did not play ""Muskrat Love.""  We even have a swimming pool scene in which they are not wearing swimsuits.  The balcony scene is a tad too familiar. It is the East and Julie is the sun!

Actually this presentation is cut above a lot of the later zombie movies. It is a story about love and redemption. It may even have a redeeming value for us as we learn all zombies are not the same.

For DVD viewers there are the standard extras that do not ass much to the experience with the exception of the voice over that tells what you are supposed to be seeing.",1380672000,,870,4.124260355029586

5517258,5,B00AW9M54I,"At first I was finding it a bit hard to work out exactly what was the deal with the zombies in this one.  They were traditionally walking aimlessly through an airport with dazed looks on their face, grunting to one another like your movie norm zombie, but then R (as he would later become known) could open an airplane door, play old records, and obviously at some stage the zombies have got the generators going and maintained the power to the airport.  Then, well I don't know if I'd say I worked it out but I guess I just accepted whatever goes, goes, forgot to question it any longer in my mind and I ended up really enjoying this film.  It didn't hurt that his human kidnap victim was smoking hot (played by Teresa Palmer).  There are moments watching this where you're thinking, well if they have a BMW and can drive it, why doesn't she just drive it away herself and return to the humans.  Or where would she have got a weedwacker from in an airport terminal?

It's a situation light comedy. R eats the brains of the boyfriend of Julie, a hot girl who is part of a reluctant scavenger group and obtains bits of the boyfriend's memory including his fondness for Julie.  He kidnaps/saves her by rubbing blood over her alive scent and drags her back to the abandoned airport where the zombies reside, and his room (a powered up airliner) on the tarmac.  He wants to feel more human (which is why zombies particularly enjoy eating brains, they feel human from the memories) and to make Julie his girlfriend.  Julie wants to return to the human base, but is beginning to realise that zombies aren't just brain dead human eating machines that her father, the military leader of the compound, has portrayed them as.  Nicholas Hoult plays an interesting high functioning zombie, but it is really his zombie best friend M (played by Rob Corddry who bring the fun vibe to the zombie masses).

This Amazon product page lists the DVD as having no features, but the one I watched had plenty, in fact combined they went for longer than the film.  There's deleted scenes and a gag reel of course but also a lot of features on the behind the scenes stuff in Montreal. Such as casting, playing the zombies, shooting the movie, finding an abandoned airport, interviews with the author of the book, bringing the book to the screen (it's well done enough that I actually want to read the book now).  Theresa Palmer also shot a lot of footage with her own camera while the movie was being made and there's a feature of that footage.  Rob Corddry again steals the scenes in all these behind the scenes features, Teresa Palmer and Nicholas Hoult all seemed to be practical jokers and always having fun the whole time, making this features fun to watch. Interestingly everything was shot trying to push the limits but keep it a PG movie (although here in Australia it is rated M).  If you can a version with these features over a featureless DVD, it's worth the money.

Warm Bodies is a refreshing spin on the same old zombie survival film we've become used to.  It doesn't obey the laws of the zombie universe, but that's why it works!",1380412800,3,3119,4.531194295900178

5517314,5,B00AW9M54I,"Warm Bodies is a neat little horror movie now playing over the Internet.  ""Cute"", ""sweet"" and ""funny"" are not words I normally associate with zombie movies. ""Gross"", ""disgusting"" and ""gore"" are the ones I use. But this movie, directed by novice filmmaker Jonathan Levine, surprised me. I don't know if it's a new trend in zombie entertainment, but a nice zombie-human love story is a positive one.

""R"" is a living dead flesh-eating zombie who spends his days stumbling around an abandoned airport with the rest of the reanimated corpses. But he realizes his situation is hopeless. Most of the introduction to Warm Bodies consists of his internal monologues. For instance:

""What am I doing with my life? I'm so pale. I should get out more. I should eat better. My posture is terrible. I should stand up straighter. People would respect me more if I stood up straighter. What's wrong with me? I just want to connect. Why can't I connect with people? Oh, right, it's because I'm dead.""

Prior to the opening of the film, a zombie apocalypse had taken place. Most of the human survivors have gathered in a walled-off fortress where General Grigio (Malkovitch) manages to keep the remaining humans alive. The zombies exist in two forms: 1) the ""corpses"", who stumble around all day, looking for human food and 2) The ""bonies"", skeletor things who will ""eat anything with a pulse"". The major difference between the corpses and the bonies are how they view their existence: corpses will eat the living, but feel conflicted about it.

A team of young adults are sent out beyond the wall to scourge for much-needed medical supplies. While the corpses attack, ""R"" finds himself smitten with one of the women (Teresa Palmer). Although he's munched on her boyfriend's brains, he pulls her out of the mob and takes her to safety in his private crash pad. At first she's terrified of him, but ""R"" manages to win her trust. He shows her how to act like a zombie to avoid being eaten. Eventually she makes it back to the human side of the wall.

But she's started something within ""R"". As he begins to develop human feelings, he becomes less of a zombie. Soon, the other corpses are learning to be human again. The bonies don't like this one bit and toss them out of the abandoned airport. Knowing the bonies are massing toward the human city, the corpses link-up with ""R"" and head toward the last refuge of humanity. Will the corpses be able to stop the Bad Living Dead? Will the humans not shoot the corpses and accept their help? Will ""R"" be able to express his love for the human woman?

It may all sound silly, but the movie works. There are some hilarious moments. Such as a scene where ""R"" tries to imagine how the airport looked before the zombie apocalypse. Instantly, we see how it was in the old days, with bored travelers shuffling around the terminal staring at their smart phones with glassy eyes.

So check it out if you get a chance. It's not even that violent.

5517453,5,B00AW9M54I,"I'll start by saying that I haven't yet read the book (but definitely plan to now) and I understand there are discrepancies, like any book-to-movie. I really enjoyed watching this, and actually watched it twice during my 24-hour rental period. Zombie purists probably won't enjoy a zombie love story, but the idea that giving people (or in this case, the undead) your time, energy, and even love could ""bring them back to life"" is powerful. While the movie contains plenty of mush, both romantic and actual brain matter, the theme is consistent throughout the movie.

I tend to judge movies by their soundtracks as well as plot, etc. and Warm Bodies didn't disappoint at all. Not only were the songs well chosen, but they were well incorporated into scenes. Something I enjoy about a good album, be it compilation or otherwise, is having a few songs I know lead me into songs and artists that are new to me, which is exactly what this soundtrack did. The musical highlight of the movie for me is probably Delta Spirit's ""Yamaha"" playing as R walks through the rain.

5517517,5,B00AW9M54I,"I'm not much of a zombie fan.  I have only recently been able to stomach The Walking Dead series from AMC and still cringe through pretty much every zombie scene.  I struggled through Zombieland and I have yet to sit through the entire Shaun of the Dead movie.  But I am getting better so when Warm Bodies was released in theaters, I begrudgingly went...and was pleasantly surprised.  Nicholas Hoult is adorable (I know, not a phrase one wants to hear about a zombie) as R, the undead misfit who falls in love with Julie, the daughter of the leader of a group of survivors of the zombie apocalypse.  The movie ignores explaining the origins of the zombie plague in favor of creating a movie in the unique perspective of the deceased.

R isn't your typical zombie, he's a loner who feels out of place among his undead compatriots existing in an airport.  He doesn't remember his life before he died, he doesn't remember how he died, and he doesn't remember his own name, but he knows he feels abnormal (even for zombie standards).  While on a ""food run"", he encounters Julie, played by the pretty Teresa Palmer.  Julie is part of a ragtag group of survivors, all teenagers which begs the question, ""why send the hope of humanity out on a suicidal pharmacy run?"" who encounter the zombie horde.  R rescues Julie and takes her home, disguised as a zombie by smearing his smelly black blood on her face.  The rest of the movie is a thinly veiled twist on Shakespeares ""Romeo and Juliet.""

It's a clever movie, much better than the poorly executed book it was based on, and deserves to be seen.  I highly recommend it.",1377475200,,1613,4.559027777777778

5517520,5,B00AW9M54I,"If you could exhume William Shakespeare today, bring him back to life, and make him watch ""Warm Bodies,"" he might just exclaim, ""Damn!  Why didn't I think of that?""  But then again, Mr. Shakespeare would only be so modest.  And his choice of words might be slightly different.

So this story has been told before, so many times that you probably can't keep count.  It's the old corpse-meets-girl-corpse-loses-girl-corpse-gets-girl-back story.  But this story has a really nice feel to it, so even though you've seen it all before, it feels fresh, even though some of the characters may smell like rotting flesh at the beginning.

And I really liked Teresa Palmer here.  She had that Amanda Seyfried thing going on; she kind of looks like her, and even though their acting styles are slightly different, they both are very solid actors.  And the rest of the cast is also very good, surprisingly good; usually, in films such as ""Warm Bodies"" the casting director and producer always seem to sacrifice acting talent because, well, they probably think that the demographic for a Zombie film doesn't care about acting.  They probably feel that the audience is as dead as the zombies on screen.  Luckily for us, this film does not make that common mistake.

While this film is obviously a take on ""Romeo and Juliet"" -- note that the lead male's character here is named ""R,"" could it be short for ""Romeo""? -- the themes are somewhat different.  One theme that I picked up on here was:  ""The world becomes a better place one person at a time.  Or at least, one corpse at a time,"" I suppose.  There are other themes, such as ""Accept people for whom they are,"" but it doesn't come across as some lame public service announcement.  It is always done with humor.

So, to Mr. Shakespeare I might say, ""Don't be so modest, and don't worry about your legacy.  They are safe for the ages.""  And to everyone else I'd say, ""Don't be a corpse.  Dig yourself up from the couch and go see 'Warm Bodies' in a hurry.  Or at least as fast as you are able to walk, being half dead and all.""  It just might change you, and change you for the better.",1377388800,3,2123,4.558201058201059

5517657,2,B00AW9M54I,"there is too much filler (and music as sweetener to the filler) to make this really worth seeing. yes, teresa palmer is cute, but not 98 minutes cute, not by at least 40 minutes ... and then there's the acting. many young actors, including palmer, seem to have gone through the same acting courses and learned the same lip bites, brow furrows, eye bulges, gasps, grins and quirky head tosses and side glances and intonations of a dialog line to communicate the stereotyped emotions that this very thin script calls for -- as the zombie voiceover does all the work of telling the story -- and it's not so much that teresa palmer is a blonde kristen stewart, it's that they use the same stereotyped facial acting repertory. but let's move on.

after the long title sequence of zombie voiceover and feeble zombie predicament humor, julie (palmer) is ""captured"" by her lover zombie (some pucker mouth actor) at about 15 minutes in, and then there is a very long sequence of the two back in the zombie's lair (an old commercial aircraft at an abandoned airport), listening to records, playing games, bonding by driving a sportscar on runways during a break in the zombie voiceover (happy teen love music takes over in this part); then comes the long sequence where julie tries to get back to her fortress home (more filler, dream sequences, zombie voiceover alternating with music, etc.), then ... oh, i'm not going to spoil it for you, there's so much more zombie voiceover and musical filler yet to come.

and besides, by this point i was getting up to make a sandwich and looking at the starry sky out on the deck and trying to decide, should i just bail on this, or come back in ten minutes, or skip to the end ... ? well, i didn't bail, so i can tell you there is a plot twist of sorts that builds just enough momentum -- *just* enough -- to push the movie through the last half hour, at least after the ""balcony"" scene (this is where the whole shakespeare angle clicked, julie and R, get it? ha ha, except that means her dead boyfriend killed by R would be tybalt, which would mean she was lip locking her cousin, eewww, that's creepy ... ).

so look: if you love zombies, and zombie voiceover, and mildly cute young actresses, and young love, and you enjoy music, and that pretty much is all you want from a movie -- and if you're 18 or under, and like your shakespeare with a twist of zombie -- then you'll probably enjoy this movie.

for the rest of us ... and you know who you are and who dragged you into watching this flimsy business ... just gut through the first hour of zombie voiceover and music filler and the rest won't be so boring -- but not by much, sad to say, not by much.",1376784000,3,2690,4.417338709677419

He lives in an airport, one day him and his friend M, go out to catch a meal.  He sees jullie for the first time, though he doesn't know what to do with a girl, he knows he doesn't want to eat her.

If you like zombies and happy endings this is the movie for you.

I found some of the movie pretty funny.  The brain eatting is a bit sickening.  It would get a higher rating, but it doesn't watch as well a second time. It is one of the few Zombie movies that doesn't give me nightmares.

It's not for everyone, it depressed my mommy, my sister said it had too much swearing and my best friend thought it was too cooky for her.",1376784000,2,732,4.076923076923077

My, that was a mistake. I recently rented this on Amazon Instant Video on the advice of my co-worker who usually is a good judge of entertainment, she hasn't lead me wrong yet. I really enjoyed this movie. From the very beginning it starts out with this wonderful humor and Nicholas Hoult narration as the zombie R is stellar. This is probably one of the most unique retellings of Romeo and Juliet that I have seen and it worked really well. One thing that I really enjoyed about this movie was one of its themes is how as a society we are always connected to the world as a whole, we become more disconnected to the people around us. The overall notion of love is what ties us all together was extremely wonderful and worked quite well. The one thing about this movie that bugged me a little is how easily people accepted things that theyve trained themselves not to it struck me unrealistic to the characters as they were portrayed but from a time setting they didn't really have the time to develop this fully. If you're looking for a quirky romance movie, filled with humor and charm then this is one you should consider.

There's a modern sensibility in this quirky romance, with the main characters' lines (and grunts) feeding off of today's obsession with Zombiedom (sorry, couldn't resist). To be sure, zombies do their zombie thing to humans here, but not to excess, which would detract from the movie's intent. There are a few plot twists and the occasional clever moment which keep the mood light despite the general state of our Nation battling these creatures.

I would have liked more details about how it is that these zombies are able to become human again after the fact is established that they need to eat human brains to survive. But as it is a fantasy - that is left to the imagination. Basic tale is that love conquers all...even being a zombie. Nicholas Hoult is a real charmer in this movie.

It also has one of the best soundtracks and scores I've heard. I might buy the score but what I want is the soundtrack and I can't find it any where not even here.

5518007,4,B00AW9M54I,"Warm Bodies mashes up three different genres, or four, depending on how you count them. The Zombie Apocalypse, the Romantic Comedy, and Shakespeare are all combined, with Paranormal Romance as a fourth genre, if you didn't find that obvious from the fact that a zombie apocalypse and a romantic comedy have been shoehorned into a Romeo and Juliet story, presumably so that any seventh graders will feel that their English course had some worth after all. The ending is an important aspect to considers, so, spoilers to follow.
The ending is entirely different. Good ol' R&J both die, alone with half the cast, according to Bill Shakespeare's original script. This time around, not only do neither the zombie guy nor the human gal die a horrible permanent death,  but the zombie actually recovers from his zombification. It's a Hollywood ending as the happy couple and everyone that you may have pitied at any point in the film lives happily ever after.

This modification of the story allows the entire film it's strongest element: theme of the healing power of human connection. Originally, the zombies are disconnected -- they seldom touch, they have shrunken zombie pupils, they eat brains in order to experience humanity once again for a few moments. The ones who completely give up hope peel off their faces and become 'bonies,"" which are even worse, tougher zombies.

The zombies' hearts start back up, symbolically spurred by the love connection between our two heroes, which proves that zombies can still connect without needing to eat brains. In the end, the zombies are redeemed, and they are connected once more. And, as a quick scenes towards the beginning points out, the whole zombie situation can be compared to the smart-phone-absorbed generation's lack of connection.

This symbolism is great and all, but it runs alongside the plot, rather than constituting it or at least dovetailing with it. The actual plot is just driven by a few attacks from the bonies, which propel everyone to a final climax that never feels as fulfilling as the themes of the film. It would have been a better film if they had ignored the traditional Hollywood need for cardboard monsters in a zombie film, and relied both on the reveals of the importance of connection and on a little more satire of the teenage mindset (One particularly good line is something similar to ""does anyone else feel the same?"" A self-obsessed and wrong yet universal thought becomes a much more legitimate one when taken from a teenager's mind and stuck into a zombie's.
Ultimately, it's a fun concept, but the film could have been better. It's just of the cutesy, quaint variety. Nice acting from the zombie lead and his best zombie friend, though. It looks like they enjoyed it.",1375142400,3,2753,4.913978494623656

5518045,5,B00AW9M54I,"First and foremost, Nicholas Hoult deserves a lot of the credit for his performance.  There was a beautiful subtlety to his acting that more than compensated for his lack of lines.  R was a role that demanded an actor who could speak volumes through mostly facial expressions and Hoult pulls it off beautifully.  There was definite chemistry between the two leads that also contributed to the strength of the movie.

As usual, John Malcovich brings so much to a small role and Analeigh Tipton shines in the best friend role.

The story, while original as a zombie movie, is a little predictable as a romance, but in the end, I didn't really care because the performances were so strong - particularly those of the leads.

5518122,4,B00AW9M54I,". . . it might have looked like this!

I'm not a zombie movie aficionado. At all. In fact, in the supernatural beings canon (witches, elves, vampires, werewolves & other shapeshifters, succubi, mermaids . . um, ghosts, giants, poltergeists, angels, demons) . . .zombies rank as my least watchable. They're incredibly slow, and it's not like you can have a meaningful conversation with one. And the proclivity of theirs to eat my brain has to be their most off-putting feature, not to mention, their rotting stench and general decomposition.

But this isn't a 'straight' zombie genre flick . . this is an affectionate lampoon crossed with a teenage Romeo and Juliet story. Sort of the kind of picture John Hughes made in the '80s, only 'John Bender' in this story is replaced by a charmingly self-aware zombie boy named 'R'. (At least, he thinks his name used to start with 'R' but that's all he's able to remember.) Even though he struggles to reproduce the most basic human language as he shuffles through his home--an abandoned airport inhabited by other members of the zombie nation--R carries on an amusingly self-deprecating and self-aware interior commentary about his current level of existence . . which is in a word, unsatisfying. One day, foraging for food (humans), R's zombie pod encounters Julie (Palmer) and her band of teenage commandoes on a supply-gathering mission. There's a firefight, but the teens come out the worse for it, being massively outnumbered. R. eats Julie's boyfriend's brain (""I'm not proud of it',"" he says ""But I can't help it--the brain is the best part."") When zombies eat the brains of their victims, they relive, for a brief moment, the memories of that person and thus get to feel human again for a moment. Thus, R. falls in love with Julie on the spot, and taking some brains to save for later, becomes her protector against his own . .er, kind.

Julie just happens to be the daughter of the commander of the last remnant of human civilization (Malkovich), so this unlikely duo outstrips Shakespeare's original star-crossed lovers as a wildly inappropriate match. Julie is at first a frightened hostage . . but slowly begins to realize that R. is unlike any zombie she's been trained to expect. In fact, in her presence he is slowly regaining his humanity. Is it possible that the 'cure' for the zombie-virus is . . .love?

An interesting premise gets dragged on a bit (okay, a lot) too long . . .the movie moves as slowly along as a zombie gait . .but our two leads are very appealing. Palmer is a rising Australian actress that will be unknown to Americans . . and Nick Hoult (Beast, X-Men First Class) has built an impressive resume stuffed with versatility since his debut as a child actor. People might not realize that this rangy youth is British, so effortlessly does he adopt the intonations and mannerisms of an American stoner (Zombie is really stoner taken to the ultimate level.)

This ""Twilight for the Zombie Crowd"" is a ""fresh"" take on a genre that is anything but fresh. Special mention goes to Rob Corddray as R.s best zombie buddy . . who manages to embue his zombie character with both sidekick humor and unexpected heart.",1374451200,2,3183,4.78

It was cool to see a movie where humans and zombies start to interact, therefore creating a miracle (don't want to spoil that part).

5518177,4,B00AW9M54I,"In the long annals of walking dead fiction, ""Warm Bodies"" is likely the first work to ever actually get inside the head of a zombie. And it turns out his thinking process is not all that different from yours or mine - if you can just get past that whole ""I want to eat your brains"" thing, that is.

Skillfully written and directed by Jonathan Levine, ""Warm Bodies"" may not be the first attempt at a zombie-movie parody - ""Shaun of the Dead,"" ""Zombieland"" and ""Fido"" got there before it - but I'll bet it's the first to apply a ""Romeo and Juliet"" template to the genre (his name is ""R"" and hers is Julie, and there's even a charming balcony scene between the two to clinch the parallel).

Nicholas Hoult plays a young walker who's been reduced to shambling aimlessly through the zombie-infested airport, playing vinyl records on the grounded jet he's converted into a comfy little ""home"" for himself, and mulling long and hard over what it means to be living out one's existence as one of the undead. He's not exactly proud of what he's become, but he's pretty much learned to accept it - that is until he devours the brain of Julie's boyfriend, thereby appropriating his memories and falling immediately in love with her. Our unlikely chivalric hero thereupon takes it upon himself to become the young woman's sole companion and protector as she tries to make her way through this dangerous and hostile world. And as Julie (Teresa Palmer) and R grow together in closeness and mutual understanding, R slowly but surely regains many of those precious qualities that once made him human.

Based on the novel by Isaac Marion, Levine's screenplay, with its romantic tone and wry voice-over narration, is a subtle, gentle movie parody rather than a smart-alecky one on the order, say, of the ""Scary"" movie franchise or ""Date Movie"" and such. And it works beautifully from beginning to end, thanks in no small measure to the extraordinary chemistry between Hoult and Palmer in the starring roles (and Rod Corddry is equally great as R's best friend among the living dead).

Corpse or no corpse, it's been a long time since the ineffability of young love has been captured so winningly on film. And the movie caps it all off with a coda that is about as sweet and uplifting as anything you're likely to see at the movies all year, guaranteed to make you feel proud to be a member of a species that, for all its faults, can still be pretty darn terrific when it puts its collective mind to it.

Unlike many of her others, this movie really fascinates..IT IS NEVER DULL..ALWAYS MOVING!!  I love the narrative inside the zombie's head; and he is cute!  The movie at times reminds me of Edward Scissorhands and at other times the classic The Time Machine.  Yet, it also as an originality that makes it it's own.  I recommend you see this gem for yourself. Underneath everything that lies deep messages and I think the more you dig the deeper they become.

So I waited for it to come out on video. I was not disappointed.  This movie was cute, funny and a refreshing twist on the zombie stories out there. I think this was the first zombie love story I've ever seen. If you ever read the book Breathers, its similar to it but slightly different. I had heard that book was going to be made into a movie. Maybe this was it or maybe it's still going to be made either way I really enjoyed this one.

However, it is not a really bad movie, it has many good and new ideas in zombie movie actually. E.g. eat human's brain could get their memories, and when R eat the last piece, he saw he was eaten by himself, I like these imaginations. Also, there are humors, `R' and `Julie', where are their names from? Clear, right?

Even my younger sister (who's not a huge fan of zombie flicks) watched it twice.
If it's good enough for BOTH my sis and I, you've got to give it a try!
Oh yeah... and my mother, after watching the first 20 minutes said she ""kinda liked it"" which is a ringing endorsement coming from a woman who's picky about her movies, and would have never selected it on her own.

5518367,4,B00AW9M54I,"Love comes into play in almost every feature film you will ever see. It comes in many forms and often times, entire movies are centered on it. Those are basically the film that I loath, but Warm Bodies was different for the simple fact that it has everything! From love and romance to apocalyptic Science Fiction, this film has something for everyone! In this world, a virus has spread and left the world in ruins. Several human settlements still exist, but they are the food source and they are surrounded. The film begins with a group of teenagers traveling into the danger zone in order to find medicine for their settlement, when they are attacked. It looks like they're all done for, when a zombie named R sees one of the girls and decides to save her instead of eat her. For some reason this girl evoked emotion in R, which led to memories. Soon the other zombies in R's group start having memories and decide to convince the humans that they are changing. Are they really changing though or is it a ploy? Love is the cure is kind of a hoke concept, but it is our most powerful emotion and it seemed plausible that this feeling could evoke memories. Nicholas Hoult (forever known as that kid from About A Boy) stars as R and is terrific. It might not take a lot of talent to play a zombie, but to play one that is learning to be human again is no easy task. Hoult plays the part perfectly and is the reason this film is believable. John Malkovich is also in Warm Bodies and while he's not playing a hilarious bad guy, he still adds a different dynamic to the film, getting involved in much of the action sequences. Warm Bodies is a refreshingly unique story that will appeal to a large audience. The Walking Dead it's not, but it still has enough bite to keep the audience that's not into all the classic romantic stuff. To be honest, I thought it might be good for a few laughs, but I never thought this film would be as good as it was. It has a message and makes an impact, while being a funny, edge of your seat thriller. This was really not something I would usually go for, but my recent Walking Dead inspired zombie craze put it on my radar and it was an amazing ride.",1373673600,,2180,4.319512195121951
5518368,4,B00AW9M54I,"As a fan of zombie movies, I naturally have issues with this entry into that genre.  The whole premise defeats the purpose of zombies, making the creatures depicted in this movie only faux-zombies.  It was also rather cynical (or just plain lazy) to deflect the reason why (or how) half of the population became zombies in the first place.  As for the claim that this is a laugh-out-loud comedy, it's not.  Yes, it has a humorous perspective, but whether or not you appreciate its glibness depends entirely on your sense of humor.  Woody Allen did not direct this movie; neither did Mel Brooks.  There are no jokes, no snappy repartee.  For pity sake, John Malkovich does a supporting turn as a soulless military type with an itchy trigger finger!  The main character eats brains to get high on someone else's memories!  There are hordes of creepy skeletal figures called Bonies and they want to eat EVERYONE!

This fractured fairy tale version of a zombie apocalypse takes some getting used to, especially as it spoils the genre with its happy-go-lucky point of view that's absolute blasphemy to zombie purists!  I'm utterly ashamed to admit that I liked it (won't go so far as to say I loved it but I am keeping it...........although nowhere near my REAL zombie movies).  There has to be some semblance of loyalty, in spirit if nothing else.",1373673600,2,1343,4.766233766233766

But some good friends recommended ""Warm Bodies"" so I thought I would give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie served up an entertaining and creative mix of drama, romance, comedy, action and, of course, zombies. I was immediately drawn into the plot and eclectic characters, and captivated from beginning to end. And in the end, ""my heart was strangely warmed"" (a famous quote from John Wesley for those of you of a Methodist persuasion). In this movie, loving the unlovable (and what can be more unlovable than a flesh-eating zombie?!) proved to be the key to both personal transformation and the renewal of a hopelessly broken, apocalyptic world. In the end, love and forgiveness triumphs over hatred and fear; lavish grace trumps militaristic legalism, and all's well that ends well. Escapist fare, perhaps, from our broken world marred by hatred, fear, and division. But perhaps not.  Perhaps love is all we lack, and all we need.",1373673600,2,1051,4.971590909090909

A zombie man narrates the tale, realizing that his life sucks and he misses being a human. It isn't until an attack on humans that said man sees a girl and falls in love and wouldn't you know it but love starts to bring the zombies back. But don't worry. There is another group of undead nicknamed ""Boneys"" who are beyond being cured and don't want anybody else happy. Good romance tale in the post apocalypse tale with a soundtrack using 70s and 80s music. A few scenes are surprisingly funny and then a lot get a chuckle.

The script is funny and has a good combination of scares and laughs.  Fans of Shaun of the Dead will enjoy this film despite it being a bit of a chick flick.  Great supporting performance by Rob Corddry (regular on the Daily Show).,1373328000,2,358,4.235294117647059

How brilliant to take the Zombie movie some place it has never been before.  I was pleasantly surprised at the story and all that went into this movie. The production, casting, directing, acting, sets, locations, camera work, wardrobe, F/X, stunts, music and everything else are all great.  Zombie eats brain, Zombie gets girl, Zombie loses girl, Zombie rescues girl.  I am not going to tell you more about the movie because that will spoil the surprise if you haven't heard what it is already.  If you like Zombie movies you may be disappointed if all you're looking for is lots of shocking turn your stomach Zombie gore.  Not that there isn't some realistic gore and excellent scares as well.  If's just this movie is a notch above standard Zombie movies with some romance and a better ending for most the humans.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan to buy it.

5518514,5,B00AW9M54I,I found an unlikely love story and a refreshing change from the carbon copy story plots that appear in most movies we see today. This is a movie I would recommend seeing if you have not seen it.,1373241600,,194,4.131578947368421
5518515,5,B00AW9M54I,"I admit--zombies are something of interest of mine. And since ""Shawn of the Dead"" came out some years back, I haven't seen anything with real humor. (Well, ""Zombie Land"" was in the neighborhood.) Most of what's out there has been terrifying or really gorey. And there's a place for that, certainly. But this was funny and unique, and just good. OK, it was somewhat predictable, but that's OK, too! Not everything is supposed to involve melting clocks, French actors, clowns, and existentialism.

I really loved this movie. NIcholas Hoult is a favorite of mine, ever since ""About a Boy."" He's terrific. And Teresa Palmer is more than just a pretty face--she's a fine actress with not enough recognition.

I also find it interesting that there seems to be a subtle message about love and acceptance that we could all stand to hear nowadays.",1373241600,,838,4.853146853146853

This movie is a somewhat different spin on the traditional zombie movie and I really liked the premise. It is a well crafted story with a strong cast and even has a happy ending which is pretty unusual for a zombie movie to say the least.

5518614,4,B00AW9M54I,"I overall enjoyed ""Warm Bodies,"" and you will not be disappointed as long as you go into it understanding it's supposed to be a goofy romantic comedy and not a horror gem.",1372809600,2,171,4.375
5518615,4,B00AW9M54I,"I encourage you see Warm Bodies. Why? Because it's a movie that will please even the most hardcore zombie flick fan. But it will also appeal to those who like their movies a little more like something Nicholas Sparks wrote. It's sweet and sappy and full of brain-eating zombies. That's right, Warm Bodies has a little something for everyone.

Warm Bodies starts with narration by a young man, who we only know as R (Nicholas Hoult). R has forgotten his name - being a zombie and all - and is just thinking that there has to be more to life than shuffling around the airport, grunting at his best friend M (Rob Corddry) and trying not to lose that last bit of humanity in himself that would turn him into what the thinking zombies (so much as they can think) refer to as Bonies. But then, R meets Julie (Teresa Palmer) after eating her boyfriend and his heart starts beating again - literally.

This is the part where you go ""Eww...."" and then ""Awww...""

I went into Warm Bodies expecting more of a dark comedy. What I did not expect was a heartfelt romance that had me near to tears at times because of its' absolute sweetness. Sure, there could have been funnier moments, but I think the intent of this film was to be a romance. But it's a cool romance and not one of those lame romance movies with Jennifer Anniston, because well, it has zombies. It's marketing genius, it is. The relationship that develops between R and Julie feels reel, even though the circumstances of the film are not. I don't know why, but it works.

Perhaps some of that has to do with the acting of Hoult and Palmer. The two have an undeniable chemistry that is so adorable that you'll want to be farting kittens mid-film. It also doesn't hurt that even as a zombie, Hoult is still adorable. His big zombie puppy dog eyes will pull you in and convince you of every word he narrates, even if R's dialogue is limited to monosyllable words.

As far as special effects go, the Bonies are actually fairly scary. In fact, the very young boy sitting next to me  started whimpering every time they appeared on screen. That was, obviously, good enough for me. There's also some brain-eating that's both gross and amusing, especially for those of us who are hardcore zombie fans.

So yes, I'll admit, the sappy ending of the movie had me in tears. I'm a sucker for a good unconventional romance and Warm Bodies has that in droves. And John Malkovich is in it. `Nuff said.",1372809600,4,2438,4.4774774774774775

The iTunes download is the HD version which is itself $19.99.  It comes with another 700+MB of extras that are still downloading.  Overall movie file size is 3.21 GB. Great.

5518659,4,B00AW9M54I,"For all of you who have been wishing - nay, craving - for a feel-good zombie movie, this one's for you: WARM BODIES scavenges several genres to bring you just the right touch of supernatural sentiment. It's a comedy wrapped in a romance wrapped in the slowly revitalizing flesh of not-quite-too-dead zombies.

As you might have learned, WARM BODIES concerns the story of young R (get it? Arrrr-r-r!), who narrates his tale of transformation and rebirth with a little whimsy thrown in. It seems that some zombies - well, those who haven't yet reached the stage of skeletonization - are starting to notice changes in themselves. R (played by Nicholas Hoult of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jack-the-Giant-Slayer/dp/B00CISAPJS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jack the Giant Slayer</a>) and M, his friend (Mmmmm....get it?) are beginning to realize they are experiencing thoughts and the desire to express them, though their mouths are not cooperating...just yet.

It's in the midst of a minor zombie vs. humans battle at the start of the movie that an interesting thing occurs: not only is R's life spared by the woman looking at him through her gun sights (apparently due to his moonpie eyes...natch), but his consumption of her boyfriend's brain sparks romantic thoughts in HIM, and these tender thoughts drive R not only to want to get to know her better, but to protect her as well. When he escorts her to his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wall-E/dp/B003QTSMXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wall-E</a>-like airplane home base, where we find he's been wrestling with the humanities for awhile: the plane is full of little human trinkets like snow globes and old vinyl LPs that he gathers along his semi-staggering wanderings.

Well, of course, complications ensue. Most notably, it turns out Julie, the girl he has rescued (played by Teresa Palmer of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sorcerer-s-Apprentice/dp/B002ZG99KO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sorcerer's Apprentice</a>) is the daughter of the leader of The Human Army (or something LIKE that, anyway) played by a very humorless John Malcovich. Since the humans are hiding behind a rather HUGE wall in their efforts to stem their seemingly hopeless losing streak, it's going to be up to Julie and R to convince her dad that the ""warm"" zombies are changing, and worthy of saving.

None of this really has to make sense; what does matter is that this pleasant movie just misses being a whole lot of fun. Director and writer Jonathan Levine, who based his movie on the book of the same name by Isaac Marion, has a lot of good comic stuff going on, but it tries so hard to be just a little violent, and just a little romantic, that it lacks just a little humor. It wouldn't have taken much to make it an off-the-wall comedy or an equally zany romance, but unfortunately it is just too little of each.

For instance, having R and Julie meet under her balcony (R and Julie-t...get it?) is a nice, subtle touch, and having Rob Corddry co-star as M is good, too - but not much is done with those assets. Hoult has a great face, and some good comic sensibilities, but I felt he was being held back...probably unavoidably, as zombies can't really show much expression. But his airplane lair never really developed into anything, and there are other little moments similarly missed throughout: one funny when R teaches Julie to walk like a him in order to blend in with his pack he actually has to tone down the zombie in her. Again, it's good for a laugh or two, but goes no further.

Regardless, even though WARM BODIES is more cute than comic, it's still fun, and I did enjoy it. It's a sweet, loveable movie all around, and great for a nice evening together cuddled on the couch.",1372723200,2,3857,5.233009708737864

I am sure everyone is dubbing this the zombie twilight because that's what it is. Overly-skinny 20 somethings playing to the teenage crowd for ""the sake of love.""

As a comic book movie loving guy the over produced zombie Apocalypse effects gave me just barely enough eye-candy to sit through the whole thing. While my softer side wanted to like the great idea of a zombie coming back to life it was disappointing in so many ways. It was poorly acted, poorly directed, and everything that wasn't special effects was so under polished I would have a hard time saying that your teenage daughter would even like it.

Don't even ask what I thought about it from a mature, artistic or academic standpoint. I am dissapointed that such an original idea in a massively overplayed genera had no metaphors, no motifs, and absolutely no Ambition to be anything other than a tweeny targeted time consumer.",1372636800,2,1115,4.649746192893401

I know the female lead from ""I am Number Four"". R digests the brains of a young man he kills as that is the only way of life left to the zombies. Seeing the dead young man's life flash before him in R's mind, R sees and remembers humanity. His journey begins to regain his heart and soul and rejoin humanity. I saw this film twice at the theater and now have my own copy. The soundtrack is fantastic.",1372636800,2,538,3.944954128440367
5518677,3,B00AW9M54I,"It was a little entertaining, but it could have been better. I liked the storyline, but they never give solid explanations. The reason why everyone turned into zombies was glossed over with one or two sentences. Why or how the zombies started turning back to human was never addressed, you were left to make the connection on your own...and it was very flimsy.

In all, it's a movie I would have on in the background while I cleaned house, but nothing I would intentionally sit down and watch again.",1372636800,,499,4.606741573033708

The romance develops very naturally and easily. I loved the narration of the movie by R, allowing the audience to understand what he is feeling.

Just the right mix of comedy and romance, and zombies! Loved it.",1372636800,,499,4.747126436781609

He couldn't keep watching it.  i finished it but was just bummed.  I am really surprised that there are any good reviews of this.

5518758,5,B00AW9M54I,"I love this movie. I know it's a little immature for a 21 year old to watch this movie over and over because of the cheese factor and Nicholas Hoult's hotness - but even disregarding that the story has special meaning. It draws parallels to real world issues such as overpopulation and conspiracy theories, the journey from deep depression to healing with love, and it does it with humor. (and hot actors. hehe)
It never comes right out and says anything, but this movie possibly could be talking about a conspiracy theory, such as the government creates mass population-reducing plan where people turn into people-eaters. (hey it's smart, if not extremely cruel).
In addition, it can be looked at like a representation of what it feels like to go from very depressed to being alive, and to get there with love. When you are depressed, you feel a little like you're dead and the rest of the population feels like they're ""living"" while you're ""undead.""
Without reading between the lines, the movie is entertaining for even a nine year old who would not analyze the depths and possible meanings, and would just like to watch a funny movie with their mom and dad. It's a great movie for the entire family. The ""bonies"", or scary skeleton heartless zombie creatures, are a little scary if your child is prone to nightmares. Other than that, this is a great movie for everybody.",1372377600,,1374,4.729166666666667

He said, ""Brit, will you please call me Jeff?"" and I said, ""ugh. Fine! You call me Brittany, then!"" And he rolled his eyes at me and made that stupid noise that boys make but I didn't even care because I had my period anyways. Like, really bad.

5518910,5,B00AW9M54I,"Ah, ""Warm Bodies,"" how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways ...

Zombies are pretty much our catch all metaphor these days.  ""Warm Bodies"" makes it easier as it uses it's zombies as metaphors for, well, everyone else.  ""R"" is our protagonist's name.  He doesn't remember his name, just that it starts with an ""R."" His thoughts are completely coherent but he's unable to move those thoughts into words and actions because he's young and naive and awkward.  Also, because he's a zombie.

Then he meets Julie, the prettiest girl this zombie's seen since he became a corpse.  Granted, when they meet she's on a mission to kill corpses and R does eat her boyfriend's brains.  Still, though, she's AWESOME.  It doesn't hurt that as R eats her boyfriend's brains he gets to see his memories of her.  For an unexplainable reason, R saves Julie from the zombies and takes her back to his place, where she digs through his record collection and realizes they like the same thematically relevant power ballads.

This really is a zombie movie as seen by someone like John Hughes.  R knows what to do to get the girl, he's just incapable of knowing how to do it.  He's awkward, clumsy, ineloquent but it's obvious, especially to her, how hard he's working to connect.  Is the power of love so great that it can turn zombies human?  Well, you'll have to see the flick to learn that for sure.

It's not all love and ""Bat Boy,"" though as Julie and R spend time together.  There are zombies like R that look mostly human and are slow and go through the motions of their old lives but there are also really nasty zombies that are just skeletons and are much more predatory.  They ignore zombies but sniff out heartbeats from a mile away.  Julie's dad is also the leader of the militant human reistance against the corpses and he seems a lot more interested in mowing down the critters than he does in learning they might be redeemable.

R is played by Nicholas Hault with a slow drawl, a few twitches and bright blue eyes that don't dilate but are still kind of handom'ish.  I mean, for a zombie.  What the movie expertly plays at is how oftentimes in romance movies, especially about young romance, how much the protagonist can be something of a cypher.  It's not what they're about, as much as people can lay their own selves overtop them and live the movie through them.  As R has had most of his life and personality stripped away, he becomes any of us.

Teresa Palmer's Julie makes it easier. She's just right: amazingly pretty but not too much, she's a little bit rugged, a little bit cute but you still get the sense she can move if the right song were playing in the world.  And of course she's perfectly open-minded and idealistic.  Girls like her in movies usually are.  It's what makes so many geeks fall in love with them.  It would probably be needlessly mean to call her the anti-Kristen Stewart, warm and engaging and full of life.

The great Rob Corddry is around as R's best zombie friend.  They grunt and moan at one another on a regular schedule and as R starts to change, so does Rob.  He also gets the best one liners, a good thing since he can only speak in them.  Julie has a best friend too, Nora, played by  the splendid Analeigh Tipton, who was equally lovable last year as the babysitter in ""Crazy Stupid Love.""  She's the sassy one.

""Warm Bodies"" never tries to become more than its own fairy tale, ""Romeo and Juliet"" riff.  There's a balcony scene even, for Pete's sake.  It works from top to bottom because it's honest and funny and the right actors are playing the right characters.  It's a marvelously joyful and optimistic romantic story.  It's also a lot of fun.

There are a million movies about decent people turning into soulless, blood-soaked zombies.  But one about soulless, blood-soakes zombies turning into people again?  It doesn't get any more romantic than that.",1371859200,,3892,4.546109510086455

5518955,5,B00AW9M54I,"I've come to think of Warm Bodies as an off-beat romantic comedy.  R's (Nicholas Hoult) inner (quite articulate) monologues are what make the film; his embodied experience as a zombie is at odds with mental and emotional desire for connectedness with those around him.  He collects remnants of a lost humanity and uses music to express his emotions.  As his relationship with Julie (Teresa Palmer) grows, R re-discovers the joys, fears, and awkwardness (""Don't be creepy, don't be creepy!"") of new love.  In so many ways, their journey encapsulates how so many of us feel when we meet someone who appreciates our own brand of weird.

5518998,4,B00AW9M54I,"I'll be honest -- when I first heard about this movie my reaction was ""Oh no, it's 'Twilight' with zombies.""  After seeing the various classic horror monsters be softened and turned into romantic male leads, I cringed at the thought of a zombie romance film.  The trailers warmed me up a little to the concept, however -- it seemed the film would be playing the concept for laughs rather than a straight romance, and I could see all kinds of potential for hilarity.  And after so many deadly-serious zombie films in recent times (""28 Days Later"" and the upcoming ""World War Z,"" for starters), it would be nice to have a comedic, tongue-in-cheek zombie film.

I finally saw ""Warm Bodies"" last night, and to my surprise it's a lot better than I thought it would be.  It's not perfect and tends to fall into clichs at parts, but it's a surprisingly sweet film that doesn't take its concept too seriously.

Our protagonist is R, a zombie who lives in an airport and spends his days shuffling around, exchanging grunted conversation with a fellow zombie, and listening to music when he's not hunting for prey.  His mundane, undead existence is shaken up one day when, while on a hunt, he spots a beautiful girl among a group of survivors.  After eating her boyfriend's brains (a process that lets a zombie look into the memories of his or her victim), he learns more about the girl, Julie, and begins to fall in love with her.  At first she's put off by his attempts to woo and protect her, but gradually she realizes that though dead, he's not the monster she expected him to be.  And as their friendship develops, both realize that a remarkable change is coming over R... and that if they're to save both the undead and the rest of humanity from the Bonies (a race of skeletal super-zombies), they have to find a way to convince humanity that the undead can be saved.  If Julie's overprotective father doesn't put a bullet in R's head first...

Yeah, the plot is essentially ""Romeo and Juliet"" in a zombie-apocalypse world.  (Even the protagonists' names, R and Julie, are a nod to the play that made me facepalm when I recognized it.)  But it's pulled off surprisingly well here.  Both young leads are good actors, and Nicholas Hoult does a superb job at playing R, somehow maintaining a slack-jawed ""zombie face"" and still managing to emote at the same time.  Teresa Palmer, as Julie, does well too as a young woman trying to maintain some sense of a normal life even as the world crumbles around her.  John Malkovich is surprisingly restrained in his role as Julie's father and the leader of the human resistance -- he could have played his usual hammy self in this film and not been out of place, but instead he chooses to play his overprotective, stubborn role straight.  This isn't a bad thing, just surprising, given that Malkovich is infamous for chewing the scenery in his films.

I admit to not watching many zombie movies, but I know enough about the tropes and clichs of the genre that I could catch the sly nods and winks the film makes toward the genre.  It actually has a feasible explanation for why zombies love human brains, and in his internal monologue R makes all sorts of wry observations about his kind (""God, we move slow"").  And it somehow manages to pull off the impossible -- a sweet love story between a zombie and a human -- without becoming overly sappy or ""Twilight-ing"" the zombie lead character.  It gets cheesy in parts, but that's part of the charm for me.

And for those worried about excessive blood and gore -- this film is surprisingly light on the blood and guts for being a zombie film.  Your average episode of ""Supernatural"" is probably more gory.

Both a sweet romantic comedy and a tongue-in-cheek look at zombie flicks, this film isn't going to win any Oscars, but it's still a fun and enjoyable flick.",1371686400,,3845,4.602639296187683

Far more than a quirky love story, this is a story that is ultimately about compassion. While the movie drags its feet for the first half-hour (pun intended) I realized as the story progressed and R's character developed, that the resulting pace with which the movie moves is quite deliberate. Quite frankly, it's almost genius. My only qualm is that John Malcovich, as Julie's father, is terribly under-utilized in this movie. That much is forgiven in light of Rob Cordrey, who does more with being a zombie than you think he could given his limited acting ability. And that's all I'll say because the less you know going into this movie, the greater the pay-off will be.

Fun, quirky, and very unique version of a happy-ending Romeo & Juliet meets the Zombies. John Malkovich was great in his brief appearances as the city leader whose daughter Julie was part of the group sent 'outside' for medications. Her boyfriend Perry is attacked & killed on their mission by 'R', who eats Perry's brains & gathers his memories. R takes Julie with him & keeps her safe, inadvertently beginning the process of 'reviving' himself. Picture a 100th monkey effect & there you have it.

The zombies I grew up on, had only one emotion if you can call it that; and that was to rip you apart limb from limb and devour you...period! However, I do understand  this is somewhat different, a romantic comedy which in my opinon is neither idealistic nor funny. This movie was weird to me, not hardly enough action to sustain my interest or keep me awake. Furthermore, as I've stated before not even romantic just kind of all around creepy. It is one of those Hollywood vehicles best left on the pages of the book it was based on, were a I'm sure it made more sense.

It's funny, I didn't even recognize the Romeo and Juliet reference until I saw the movie! Hah! It was a sweet love story, and I believe that the moral of it was that people need to remember what is important in this world; our fellow man. Love and caring is what heals the world. It may sound sappy, but it wasn't a sappy movie. It was very touching and lovely. If you like love stories, but also like movies with bizarre twists then I would recommend this movie to you!

I wasn't sure what to think of this prior to renting and decided to take a chance on a different kind of zombie movie and warm bodies is definitely different. I would describe this movie as a romance comedy that tends to be a little hokey at times with the comedy part of it but does have its moments of cuteness. Surprisingly there is a bit more action than I anticipated especially with the ""boneys"" that actually help make the movie a bit more entertaining as there are some spots that tend to drag on, especially with the record playing.

Overall this movie is a decent rent to watch if you are looking for something a little different than the ordinary, although maybe not for kids that are too young as the scenes with the boneys could be scary for adults with young ones",1371340800,,957,4.462857142857143

5519155,4,B00AW9M54I,"""Romantic zombie comedy"" - three words you don't normally see together when describing a film, but it adds up to some extreme coolness here.  'Warm Bodes' stars Nicholas Hoult (definitely one of the best actors, of his generation, working today) as ""R"" (he can't remember what his name was), a zombie in some future time when zombies have driven all the humans into walled fortresses of their own, who - even though he groans and slouches around and eats humans - still has a brain that can think and reason, to some degree.  R narrates the story, a functioning mind stuck in a zombie body ... until, during a particularly brutal fight between the humans and zombies, he catches sight of a beautiful young girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer), who literally makes his heart skip a beat - for the first time since he became part of the undead!  Unknowingly killing Julie's ex-boyfriend in the fight, R's nature takes over and he starts eating the dead guy's brains; eating brains is R's thing, and probably what's keeping him partially human inside, because in this film when a zombie eats a human's brains he/she also sees their memories; their hopes, fears and dreams.  R falls in love with Julie in that moment, and actually fends off the other zombies to pull her to safety, taking her to an abandoned airplane he's set up, at the airport, as his home.

The more time he spends with Julie, the more human he becomes, and as he finally relents to helping her get back to her home and father (played by John Malkovich, and the leader of the walled city of people trying to kill off all the zombies), not only does R become more and more human again ... the change in him starts a chain reaction in the rest of the zombie horde, raising a possible hope for the future of the human race.

This film is a comedy, zombie pic, bromance (R's best zombie buddy M, as played by Rob Corddry, is terrific - though I didn't buy him as a zombie as much as I did Hoult), and romantic tale of love conquers all; ultimately uplifting, and while not the perfect film I would hope that even those who aren't normally into zombie flicks will give it a go; it IS that good.",1371340800,,2151,4.460559796437659

5519189,1,B00AW9M54I,"The biggest problem with ""Warm Bodies"" is that it's a novel idea that should be catered toward people who have seen a lot of zombie movies. Instead, it seems catered to 14-16 year old girls who have heard of zombies and love Nicholas Hoult. Don't get me wrong; I like Nicholas Hoult. Loved him in ""About A Boy"", liked him in ""X-Men: First Class"". Haven't really seen any other movies of his, but he seems to rise to the level of whatever he's in, and in the case of this movie he's not done any favors.

The casting seems to be mostly WB Pilot rejects, the script sounded like it was written by a girl who read and loved the Twilight series (scenes full of vague, emotional outbursts and simmering), and, for a romantic comedy / zombie movie, it had neither a charming protagonist nor entertaining violence. It's a PG-13 movie in every way; compromising, tepid, contrived, self-congratulatory, and lame. Get the tongue out of your cheek long enough to tell a story.

With the absolute pile of zombie-apoc movies out there in the last ten years, I'm really disappointed ""Warm Bodies"" plays it this safe. It lacks a maturity or potency in its irony that might really win you over, but it never stops winking to the camera. The idea that a cute zombie has a self-deprecating, twenty-something inner-monologue, and can become a real person if he meets the right girl (""and isn't that just such a commentary on our generation""), is enough to get someone to see this movie. But it's not enough to carry the audience through 90 minutes. We're bombarded with these themes so regularly already, that we ""Get It"" inside of about 3 minutes once the movie starts, but the director wants to make absolutely sure every half-baked situation is set-up, every gag possible is played, and every drop is squeezed out of such an ultimately small fruit.",1371168000,5,1832,4.6687306501547985

predictable. The high point for me it that it showed zombies as being potentially curable.  In other words... maybe zombies will
become extinct and the culture can move onto something else.

It is very, very low on the gore factor.  Really, the story is the important thing here.  Those of you who saw 28 days later will remember that rage caused the zombie epidemic,  SPOILER here love saves the damned.  Playful, not to be taken seriously by anyone.

5519422,2,B00AW9M54I,"Obviously I didn't expect this to be your run of the mill zombie flick - the premise is fairly straight forward; however, I did expect a little more zombie than I got.

If you are a traditionalist in the zombie genre, like myself, this movie will leave something to be desired. There were a few actions spots, but 90% of this film focuses on the relationship between the zombies and the humans (specifically the two protagonists on the cover). It was very preachy in a hipster, sociological/philosophical kind of way. If you decide to watch it, you'll know what I mean.

Back to my point.. if you are a zombie/infection fan, you may be dismayed by the liberties the writers took. Talking, improved logic, working understanding of technology.. things of that sort that you just don't want to see in the walking dead or infected multitudes. Action sequences and scares are few and far between. And the ending and ""resolution"" leave a lot to be desired. In fact, it was borderline silly.

To be fair, the movie (strictly watching it for what it is/intends to be) itself wasn't bad. I finished it, but I wouldn't watch it again. If you happen to have a girlfriend/wife that likes zombies and hopeless romance flicks.. this could be a winner.

Finally it was available and I planned a night in just so I could watch it.  What a let down.  It was a waste of $5 (HD version) and a waste of almost two hours.  Save yourself the money and time.

The movie has a novel premise but that's where the novelty ends.  It jumps right into an internal zombie monologue and thereby skips a lot of potential character development and humor.  Ok, fine.  Then we are introduced to the female lead and it's love at first sight.  Again, skipping a lot of potential development and that really defines the movie.  It's just a lot of sudden and discrete changes with no intervening development.

As with most Rom-Com movies they is a big ""couple conflict"" set up.  And when the male lead finally reveals his big secret.... nothing.  It's accepted and dismissed.

5519482,4,B00AW9M54I,"Goofy, funny and surprisingly cute (in a good way), ""Warm Bodies"" manages to be surprisingly endearing and fun. ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult from ""X-Men: First Class"")has the typical life of a zombie--shuffle aimlessly, groan and eat.

Yes, this film does reference Romeo and Juliet (isn't it obvious?) but with a much different outcome for the star crossed lovers.

SPOILERS: When he meets Julie (Theresa Palmer)things change; ""R"" finds his humanity returning his language skills expanding and he decides NOT to eat her. He does, however, end up eating his boyfriend. You see eating brains allows these zombies to experience the memories of those they kill and that only adds to the allure of Julie. He saves her. The only problem is that her dad (John Malkovich) is the lead zombie killer for their protected community. With the support of her best friend (Analeigh Tipton who steals every single scene she's in--someone give her a starring role quickly), Julie faces the challenge of convincing her father the zombies need their help to become human again and stop killing them while avoiding the boneys--zombies so far gone that they are feared by the regular zombies--and her father just isn't buying it.

END OF SPOILERS:

As a combo genre film (romcom/horror) ""Warm Bodies"" could have been a disaster but the director and writer of the script do a very good job of balancing all of these elements with the comedy flowing naturally out of the story and characters.

The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a detailed, rich presentation. There's a healthy amount of film grain and the cool colors of the film look very smooth. The Boneys--the main villains--are pretty scary looking although I feel that as good as they look, they could have been better integrated into the film. The lossless audio sounds marvelous with a terrific 7.1 mix that is very immersive.

The special features include a terrific audio commentary featuring the director of the film and actors Hoult & Palmer. It's a fun, informative listen.

There are a total of nine featurettes on the making of the film and they are informative covering everything from the airport the film was shot at to the creation of the creatures for the film. Actor Rob Corddry who gives a great performance as the friend of ""R"" (named ""M"")appears in the featurette on acting like a zombie. Corddry is a highlight of the film (and clearly deserves more screen time in films and, perhaps, his own TV series--he's a terrific character actor)and amusing. He's also a highlight of the gag reel.

Zombie fanatics were frustrated with it because it's not really a zombie film, and those who expected a comedy were frustrated because it wasn't funny. Warm Bodies is neither of these things.

Just like Funny Farm is a satire, so is this film. It's basically as other reviewers have mentioned, a love story, symbolizing that how we feel and treat each other has the power to revive. It's a cute, simple message just told through a zombie metaphor. If you understand that the film is symbolic, and a love story you analyze it less and enjoy it more.

If you are a die-hard zombie fan, this film is not for you. If you are looking for a comedy like Shaun of the Dead, this is definitely the wrong movie for you.

5519540,4,B00AW9M54I,"Summit Entertainment brings home zombie romance comedy ""Warm Bodies"" for fans of the walking dead to enjoy. Zombie movies are a dime a dozen right now. This charming little mix of action, horror, and a love story changes things up a bit. It provides a satisfying experience, yet left me surprised there wasn't more funny parts.

""Warm Bodies"" tells the tale of a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult). R spends his days wandering through an airport aimlessly. One day he saves a girl named Julie (Teresa Palmer) from an attack by the walking dead. The two become unlikely friends, which appears to restore R's humanity over time. Have they discovered a way to bring the zombie masses back to life?

As a whole, ""Warm Bodies"" works. I have to say I was expecting more humor than I got. While it was funny, it fell short of delivering the grins trailers promised. Director / Writer Jonathan Levine did a great job with creating a bond between the two lead characters. However, Julie accepts the fact that R ate her boyfriend way too casually.

The zombie carnage and gory imagery isn't downplayed anywhere near as much as one would expect in an adaptation of a young adult novel rated PG-13. There's plenty of scenes of the living dead eating dinner. Creatures called ""Bonies"" also offer a higher level of horror than what one would expect from a zombie romance / comedy.

""Warm Bodies"" is presented in 1080p High Definition with 7.1 surround sound audio. The picture looks great and is clear. Unfortunately, the hi-def transfer exposes the distracting CGI limitations of the ""Bonies."" The audio experience is highlighted by great sound effects and a fitting musical score coupled with some relevant rock tracks throughout.

The Blu-ray for ""Warm Bodies"" is packed with bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Director Jonathan Levine and Actors Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer. There are seven ""behind-the-scenes"" featurettes which address everything from location scouting to casting and special effects. Teresa Palmer's home movies, acting tips provided by actor Rob Corddry, deleted scenes, gag reels, and a theatrical trailer round out the special features.

Although ""Warm Bodies"" doesn't deliver the laughs I was expecting, it's still an entertaining and warm film. It's a less campy and more serious mix of 1993's ""My Boyfriend's Back"" and ""I Am Legend."" There's something for horror fans and romantics to enjoy in this movie.",1370390400,,2435,5.029776674937965

The living have walled themselves up, and everyone outside the wall is dead. 'R' can only remember the first letter of his name (but what's in a name? It is not hand, nor foot, nor arm...) I still can't get over how the writer of this cleverly twisted retelling did it. It is definitely NOT a faithful retelling; it's much smarter than that. I watched this with a classroom full of 14-15 yr olds who had just finished reading Romeo and Juliet, some of whom were sick of it. But I and they had a blast noting the clever parallels, thematic similarities, composites and send-ups of Shakespeare's classic. Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy that plays like a comedy, and my kids enjoyed the humor in reading it, but hated both film versions they watched. This modernized fantasy analog had terrific comedy that won them over though, and happily for me as their teacher, a great deal of their pleasure came from being in on the jokes and twists because they had the Bard's version under their belts. Thank you, Jonathon Levine for this screenplay. You gave a high school English teacher a fantastic gift. When I asked my kids if they thought it was worth it to have read a classic so they could be in on this grand joke, their smiles and applause answered the question for me.

Her best friend is really funny, too, especially when she discovers her friend is ""dating"" a zombie.  John Malkovich is perfect as the distant, disapproving father.

I also found it a little hard to find R likeable after witnessing him brutally attack and eat a human at the beginning of the film.  What kind of makes you care for him is when Julie says that she sees him trying harder than most humans she knows.

5519568,4,B00AW9M54I,"I've never been big on zombie flicks but my husband convinced me to give it a try and I'm glad I did. ""Warm Bodies"" was a pleasant surprise. The central premise of the story is about a young male zombie simply known as R (played by Nicholas Hoult of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/About-a-Boy/dp/B000ICZCZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">About a Boy</a>) who despite his natural instincts to chow down on humans, rescues attractive zombie hunter Julie (Teresa Palmer). Thus begins a sweet, albeit unconventional love story of sorts as Julie's mistrust of the undead R gradually gives way to friendship and affection.

I loved how the story blended horror elements with a love story and comedic bits. The leads were great especially Hoult who delivers a credible performance as the slacker zombie kid with heart who tries to come to terms with his inexplicable, against zombie nature romantic attachment to human Julie. This sexual attraction and affection for a human plays an important role in the story with far-reaching consequences in a post-apocalyptic world where masses of humans have been devastated by the zombie virus. Aside from the leads, the supporting cast also delivers fun and engaging performances - Rob Corddry as R's mentor/best friend is a hoot to watch, Analeigh Tipton as Julie's best friend, and John Malkovich as Julie's father and commander of the human army dedicated to eradicating the zombies.

There really aren't scary bits in this film but the suspense quotient is respectable especially in scenes where the skeletors or boneys (zombies that are so far gone that they look like demonic animated skeletons) are on the prowl for victims. The story's central focus though remains the love story between R and Julie and it makes for a fun, and yes, sweet, sappy watch.",1370390400,,1835,5.302405498281787

5519611,4,B00AW9M54I,"Warm Bodies is a  poignant and moving little gem of a movie. The acting is solid and the lead zombie's yearnings and confusions (he is aptly played by Nicholas Hoult) are convincing. Trivia buffs might be interested in knowing that Hoult also starred as young Marcus in About a Boy.

There are many small moments of humor in this film, nicely inserted into the flow of events. There is also a cute scene that gives a nod to Romeo and Juliet. One caution: the zombie voices don't always result in clearly audible speech but that didn't happen often enough to irritate us. If you need to understand every word in a film, however, that isn't likely.

The basic set-up: after an apocalyptic event, the world is left populated with zombies and humans, with the humans (led by the always watchable John Malkovich) determined to kill the zombies. The ""kill the zombies"" theme isn't anything new in the zombie genre so thankfully there is an added twist. I won't give spoilers about that although this site's photo doesn't leave much to the imagination about that. Even so, not every event is wholly predictable.

I was particularly entranced by the actors in the film. Viewers may see parallels between zombie behavior and growing alienation, loss of identity, and lack of community in our society - and those parallels definitely increased my enjoyment of what might otherwise have been only a mildly diverting film.

What may make or break this movie for viewers is the resonance of the zombie/human interactions. I never lost interest in those- or in any of the lead or minor characters.

Funny, sweet, yet a bit scary at times, Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer play their roles to perfection. By the end of the movie, you feel happy and content, yet deep inside, you find yourself wishing that the story would continue on. Maybe wondering if ""R"" becomes truly human again? Or do he and Julie go on with their lives together and produce half zombie babies? Haha! I say that a Warm Bodies sequel with Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer should be considered for all those people out there like me who need their love story to further blossom into a forever land of zombie ""happily ever after""...",1370304000,,858,4.436708860759493
5519616,5,B00AW9M54I,"I read a poor review of this film on NY Times and from audience reaction to it, which was totally opposite from the review, I purchased this film, thinking I would probably only want to see it one time.  Boy, was I wrong.  Not only was it charming, witty, not dumb, and very, very well acted as well as produced very, very well, it had a performance by John Malkovich which was totally different from anything I ever saw him play.  In Zombie movies their is alway a fanatical, take no prisoners, kill everything in sight leader who at one point or another goes totally off the rails and starts butchering everything because it feels so good to him and gives him so much power.  Expecting this to be the type of character we were going to get, who would end up getting blown up or something, I was totally surprised when there were certain scenes in which the guy showed signs of being the leader, but not really knowing what he should do, so he'd ask for an opinion.  I'm not going to go into details because that would ruin it for you.  The film is really about the haves and have nots and that blasted 1% who wants to take over everything.  I totally loved this film and Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer were a sweet, sweet pair and their love story really drives the film.  Dave Franco is in it too, and as usual, he was tops.  For a young man with a not so buff body, Nicholas Hoult has a beautiful face, in fact he was much prettier than the heroine.  Kind of like Montgonery Clift up against Olivia DeHaviland in ""The Heiress"".",1370304000,,1533,4.310104529616725

Three is being generous. The movie could have been much better if it picked a side....serious with a little comedy or comedy with a little serious. This film seemed to not have a good balance between the two, constantly rotating between serious and absurd...at times painful to watch, lacking all matter of sense and reality. If it were just a silly comedy this would be okay, but passing itself off at times as a more serious film with a message, it just does not blend well.

3 stars is a tough sell, as it was a okay movie to watch but I would not try to talk anyone else into spending 1.5 hours of their life on it.",1369353600,,777,4.214765100671141
5519764,5,B00AW9M54I,"This film was my all time favorite during the limited time it was shown in theaters here. I must have gone to see it at least 9 times. The characters are so true to the story that Issac Marion put forth in the original novel that the film is based on. Warm Bodies gives you everything you would want from a film. The horror, suspense, the intense emotional rollercoaster, and the hilarity that you've only seen before in Shaun of the Dead. The actors that portrayed the leading roles are just perfect and spot on for the film. Nicholas Hoult that played ""R"" gave him all the heart and soul, that a real zombie may have lacked. While Teresa was able to embody the same kick ass attitude we expect from someone so capable of taking a leading lady role and running it like it should be. She showed in The Sorcerers Apprentice, I Am Number Four, and now Warm Bodies that she can play dual roles as the tough down to business chick as well as the warrior half and then the tentative love interest even when the guy is dead. I'm ashamed to say that while writing this I've unfortunately forgotten the name of the actor that portrays Marcus but his comedic timing is unforgettable. The scene at the airport lounge where they decide to...nope...just check the film out to be sure.

And I love how the zombie theme was not over played. My favorite characters besides the two main characters had to be M or Marcus and Julie's best friend.

5519851,3,B00AW9M54I,"This was a good movie, though not a great movie. Prior to seeing it I had a notion that it would be a hilarious, romantic drama/thriller. It was not! Yes, there was comedy and sweet moments in the movie, however it was nowhere near the caliber of what everyone insinuated it would be like in their recommendations/articles. The acting in itself was good, the storyline for the most part was clever and witty. Most of the the things I disliked were small so I won't bother mentioning it because it probably made no difference to anyone else. My main problem with the movie was the actual zombies. In many scenes they did not behave like zombies. They behaved like a human who was trying to pretend to be a zombie. It was overdone and not believable. R (aka Romeo) and the other zombies supposedly started transforming back into people after R met the girl Julia (aka Juliette). However, by his own admission he listened to music and had limited words with a few of the other zombies prior to meeting her. That is not something zombies are supposed to do. I also found it weird that the zombies seemed to know their surroundings, and each other. That goes against the lore of zombieism. To me the movie was definitely overrated and outlandishly positively critiqued by pretty much every critic and film goer that I know. Based on the recommendations of my family and friends, I expected something far better. In short, is it worth a rental! Yes! Would I buy it? No!",1368230400,,1463,4.587786259541985
5519852,4,B00AW9M54I,"The zombies are coming!  The zombies are coming!  Yeah, it's a cheap way to start a review, so if you decided to leave - it's understandable and you're forgiven (not really).  Never the less, zombie-mania is running rampant on television, the big screen, video games, novels, etc. - so much so that it would appear (for now, at least) that zombies have permanently embedded themselves on our media entertainment...and have no intentions of leaving us alone any time soon.  Now, there's not enough time in the day to recap the occasionally dull, often predictable history of the ""zombie"" or the massive amount of renditions they've portrayed over the years.  However, without their leg-dragging history, they wouldn't be enjoying their fruitful present - in the form of a number one movie at the box:  Warm Bodies.

Like any previous flick with ""dead"" in the title or named Resident Evil, zombies always play the bad guys.  They eat brains and flesh, and are one of Hollywood's greatest villains of all-time.  However, Warm Bodies shows us another side of the zombie psyche - the active-minded protagonist.  Based on Issac Marion's novel of the same name, the film stars Nicholas Hoult as R, a youthful zombie living in a post-apocalyptic city.  As most zombies do, he spends his days slowly wondering about looking for flesh - when one day he and his friends stumble upon a group of humans gathering supplies.  Among the humans is Julie (Teresa Palmer), and it's love at first sight for R.  The problem is he's still a zombie and she's a human - not to mention the daughter of the anti-zombie movement's leader (John Malkovich).  Rob Corddry and Analeigh Tipton also star in supporting roles.

For a character having only a few lines to utter, Nicholas Hoult manages to work his eyes and body movements in a way that allows him to stay true to the motions of a typical zombie.  His co-star love interest, Teresa Palmer - dubbed a Kristin Stewart look-a-like, dominates the majority of the dialogue and will make you wish it were her playing the lead in the Twilight films instead of Stewart.  Together, Hoult and Palmer are engaging and memorable due largely to Jonathan Levine's writing and directing.  His character's are thoughtful and witty, while his directing ability is undoubtedly effective.  He manages to keep the flow of entertainment perfectly balanced and there's very little doubt he has a future cult-classic on his hands.

If you happen to get a brief look at this film - whether it's from a trailer, TV spot, or other clip - this film comes off as a pretty hokey idea.  However, the rule of ""don't judge a book by its cover"" absolutely applies to this film.  If there's one word to describe this film, it's plain and simply ENJOYABLE.  Zombie films aren't for everyone, but this film really does have a little something for everyone.  For the most part, it's family-friendly with the core of the story focusing on the unconventional love story between a human and a zombie - playing off a Beauty and the Beast style of fairy tale.  A new breed of zombies serves as the villain in this film, making for some action and suspense.  And, there's plenty of lighthearted comedy to keep you laughing.

To be honest, it's about time something new was done in the world of zombies.  These days, too much of the zombie entertainment looks and feels like Resident Evil or The Walking Dead.  Easily one of the best zombie encounters in recent memory, Warm Bodies will remind you of the charm and wit in Shaun of the Dead, while still maintaining those core principles of brain-eating and lousy make-up.  Regardless, if you're on the fence about seeing this film, consider this the push you've been waiting for to go see it.  Don't be a zombie - starting running to your local ticket window now.

5519858,4,B00AW9M54I,"Now that Robert Pattison's big series is over, and he has yet to make a successful film not associated with brooding vampires or hunky werewolves, Hollywood is searching for The Next Big Thing among the pool of eligible young actors.

Enter Nicholas Hoult. Hoult has been around a while, he was literal Boy in ""About a Boy"", starring Hugh Grant as figurative boy and Toni Collette. Now that he is in his twenties, the studios are making a little push to position him as the NBT. He is currently in two big releases, which is a good sign, but only one of them is worth your attention, which is problematic.

It makes sense that Hoult is being groomed for this new role; he's British, not hard on the eyes and he can act. RPats shares two of these three qualities. Slam! Any Twihards reading this review have no doubt clicked ""Not Helpful"" provided they understood the slam. Double Slam!

But back to the reviews. The first and better film ""Warm Bodies"" tells a modern ""Romeo & Juliet""-esque tale. But in this case R is a zombie (Hoult) and Julie (Teresa Palmer, ""I Am Number Four"") is one of an ever decreasing group of humans. A few years ago, a virus began turning humans into zombies and this created a society with three groups, humans, zombies and Bonies - zombies who have gone to the next level and will eat both zombies and humans. A group of humans, led by Grigio (John Malkovich) have created a safe haven in the middle of the city, living behind patrolled walls. Grigio is a ""Shoot first and ask questions later"" kind of guy, doing anything to protect the lives of the people in his care. He is also Julie's father. Julie goes out on a supply run with her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco) and best friend, Nora (Analeigh Tipton). At the pharmacy, they are quickly overrun by R and a group of his friends. But R is instantly taken by Julie's beauty and feels his heart start to beat again. He pauses while eating one of her friends to appreciate her full Warrior Mode as she fights off his friends. The Bonies attack and R takes Julie to his home, an abandoned jet at the airport. R pleads with her to stay, for her protection, and they get to know each other.

R quickly realizes he is changing-his expanding vocabulary is one sign-and he eventually convinces Julie of the change, hoping to gain her affection in the process. But they realize the change is happening in all of the zombies. Julie decides she should try to convince her dad of this, because the zombies could help the humans fight off the increasingly vigilant Bonies. R and Julie sneak into the barricaded area with the help of R's friend, M (Rob Corddry). All they have to do is convince her dad of the change, which is easier said than done.

Directed by Jonathan Levine (""50/50""), ""Warm Bodies"" is a unique, amusing and entertaining film. There is a lot to like and appreciate about it and it just seems smarter and more involving than other tween romances featuring dark creatures.

Much like ""Zombieland"", the filmmakers don't waste a lot of time. From the first frame, we meet R and listen to him talk about his current life as he walks aimlessly through the airport he calls home. As he introduces us to his world we see brief snippets of the past, much of it through news program headlines, giving us more than enough information to illustrate how the world got into this state. It is a fast and complete picture and doesn't slow down the narrative at all.

The zombies are amusing enough because they are painted as victims, to an extent, who have to fend off attacks by both humans and Bonies. As they walk around, many still trapped in the meaningless jobs they had as humans, they are doing what they did in life, working to live. Now that they are real zombies, little has changed.

The best thing about ""Warm Bodies"" is everything in and about the film seems very familiar. Two teens in love. Parents against it. But they fight for their love. It's a story as old as, well, Shakespeare. But Levine adds unusual elements and sets the story in an unexpected time and place. What this does is take the usual and make it different, exciting and unexpected. With so many cookie-cutter teen romances out there, it is refreshing to watch a film that takes the extra step to create an original and unusual story.

It is also nice to watch a romance develop more naturally. It takes a long time, in the film universe, for Julie to accept R and fall in love with him. In so many films, it seems like someone flips a switch and the character changes. Julie is old enough, wise enough and weary enough to be resistant and make sure he is the right guy. Zombie or not.

The addition of Rob Corddry is a nice touch. He plays M, another zombie who is R's friend, as much as they can have friends; he grunts in response to R's grunts and they spend a lot of time together. Given their age difference, it is a nice touch to make them friends, because their relationship seems borne out of convenience, another nod back to the human-as-zombie references populating this film. And when the change begins to happen, M is at R's side, ready to lead the fight against the Bonies.

John Malkovich plays the leader of the humans, a no-nonsense type of guy who leads his people with an iron fist, unwilling to let anyone who may be infected into the compound. Grigio is a nice change of pace for the actor, showing once again he can take on just about any role and make it interesting.

But Hoult is the real stand-out in the film. He brings a wide-range of skill to the role, giving R a lot of personality and interest. He always makes the zombie interesting, even before he starts to change and become more human. In the beginning he is more of a typical zombie, managing only monosyllabic grunts, moving slow, eating humans, looks like he just rolled out of a trash dumpster. But he is extremely introspective and we listen to him narrate his everyday existence.

The more time he spends with Julie, the more he changes. As he grows closer to Julie, he tries to communicate and the words start to flow a little more naturally. It is much more difficult for actors to create interesting, viable characters without the use of their voice. Initially, Hoult has to use facial expressions to express his emotions. He can't even really use his arms or body language. It is an interesting involving performance making a good film even better.

For every NBT to make it through. Hollywood history is littered with thousands of handsome young actors who didn't make a lasting impression. They are given a big push, star in two or three high profile films that flop and then end up starring in a show in the CW. The sad thing is that the failure of these films is not always the actor's fault. Those that can act often get cast in bad films, or poorly marketed films. Cast him in a period costume romance and then a hard hitting urban drama. The tweens who made his first film a huge hit will surely follow and the success will follow. Or not.

I think Hoult can and will rise above the failure of ""Jack""; he got many good reviews for ""Warm Bodies"", he had a small, but interesting role in ""A Single Man"", he was on the BBC version of ""Skins"". In other words, he can act. His agents and handlers just need to steer him away from some of the more iffy blockbusters. If a balance can be reached, Hoult can become a fixture of Hollywood. Hell, he might even end up seated next to Nicholson at a future Oscar ceremony.",1363824000,8,7469,4.473568281938326

This movie is not only a fun genre-bending zomedy, it is an allegory for how too much technology in our lives has caused us to lose our connection with humanity, and some of our humanity itself, as well as a coming-of-age story, and take on Romeo and Juliet.

There are so many interesting things going on in this movie at the same time, it really warrants multiple viewings.  I caught things on my second viewing I missed on the first, like the subtle ""Airplane!"" reference early in the film.

Jonathan Levine has done a great job adapting the book, which I loved, and directing the movie.  But it's Nicholas Hoult and Teresa Palmer who ultimately make it as winning as it is.  I found myself caring about these characters so much by the end of the movie, I didn't want it to end and found myself thinking about what might happen next for them.  I actually read the book afterwards because I loved the characters so much, I wanted to know more about them.  Both of these actors breathe so much life into these characters (no pun intended).  I loved watching Nicholas Hoult gradually, subtlely regain his humanity.  There are not too many actors of any age who could pull that off convincingly, and that he gets that at so young an age is amazing.

I can't recommend this movie enough.  It is my favorite of 2013 so far, and I've seen just about everything else out there.  I can't wait to own it and be able to watch it a few more times.",1363046400,,1691,4.343949044585988
5519892,4,B00AW9M54I,"First of all, I love me my Zombie films.  And lately there have been a lot of them.  We're sort of in a zombie renaissance.  I feel we've reached a point now too where there are so many that the only real point of producing new ones is to mess with the formula.  Perhaps that's why Romero's last two films were not really all that well received...  where he was once experimenting with the formula he himself developed, his last two were really more of the same.  Maybe I'm being a little harsh, I haven't actually seen Survival of the Dead (so I am only going by heresay, but the heresay on it is pretty one note) but I can't imagine anyone really standing up for Diary of the Dead.  It can't stand up to any of his earlier efforts, even Land of the Dead (Romero's only full on mainstream film I can think of).

In any case, I'm getting a little side tracked.  Continuing the trend of monkeying with the formula, Warm Zombies...  I mean Bodies was just released.  It's not particularly heavy or deep, but it is a lot of fun, very sweet, and more then a little heart warming.  It may be the first Zombie movie I can think of with told from the Zombie's perspective, with a zombie protagonist.  On that note it does cheat a little.  I don't mind the inner dialogue of ""R"" (he can't remember his name, only that it starts with R) but they do have trouble straddling the line of mindless automaton, and thinking and feeling zombie.  It's a difficult juggling act, which they don't completely succeed in, making the zombies a little inconsistent from one scene to the next, but given what they are trying to do with the story, it's hard to imagine how it could have been handled differently.  Zombie movies tend to be very much about setting up a system of rules, and then showcasing what those rules mean for the universe, and here they aren't able to follow there own rules 100 percent, so you end up with a few leaps of logic that don't make a lot of sense.  It's a minor nitpick though, and remember we're talking about a movie involving walking corpses who not only eat human brains, but literally eat their memories.  That leads me to an interesting point in this film, they introduce a new rule to the mix where zombies experience the memories of their victims by eating their brains.  This to my knowledge has never been suggested before, but makes a good explanation for why zombies specifically eat brains, but still leaving the more general carnivorous proclivities intact.

One thing I find interesting about the whole genre, is by and large there has been a shift in tone from one of general hopelessness to one that actually feels rather uplifting.  This is strange because right now it seems to me that most movies and genres are actually trending the exact opposite.  Everyone seems to have a very poor outlook on the future right now, but looking at the modern state of Zombie films, you have a feeling of ""We're gonna make it after all"".  Maybe the makers of Zombie films just feel that hopelessness has been played out.  In any case, this movie has as hopeful a message as you could possibly want.  Not only would we survive the zombie apocalypse, but one day will learn to be best friends with the zombies!  (it doesn't come across QUITE as cheesy in the movie)  This I think is very nice message for our times.  I think the hopeful outlook is something people need right now.

The actors mostly acquit themselves nicely, though the heroine is really kindof a bit bland.  John Malcovich is always a nice addition to any movie, and though he is a bit underused as the heroines obsessed militaristic father, his few scenes really shine.  ""M"" is also a very nice character played in an unusually strait manner by the usually comic Rob Corddry.  He is R's best friend whom R often ALMOST has conversations with!  And of course we come to the protagonist, R, who really steals the whole show.  His ""inner monologue"" if it can be called that, really holds the whole thing together, and makes you feel for this mindless automaton.  He also handles his gradual transition from traditional moaning and groaning zombie to thinking feeling and speaking ""almost"" human quite well.  He is played by Nicholas Holt who seems to be a bit of an up and comer right now, and I wouldn't be surprised to see his career take off in the next few years.

In one killing spree, after munching down the boyfriend he finds himself attracted to the girlfriend. Another twist is that consuming the brain of the boyfriend gives him insights into the girl.

Narration and flashbacks were frequently used to move the story along. The movie was perhaps a bit over-narrated; would have enjoyed more time focused on the budding girl-meets-zombie relationship.

This movie stimulates the brain cells and has many many funny visual bits and dialogue. I feel like I need to watch it a few more times to fully appreciate all going on, and well might give it another star then.

5519897,5,B00AW9M54I,"This is perhaps the oddest adaptation of Romeo and Juliet to date. The names ""R"" (Nicholas Hoult) and Julie (Teresa Palmer) should clue you in. The film starts out with first person narration from ""R"", a zombie. He let's us know he can not connect with people, the theme of the film that zombies are simply people who have lost their connection to other people. If they can regain that connection, they can be cured or at any rate, not smell as bad.

In this tale ""R"" consumes the brains of Julie's boyfriend and gains his memory. This starts a platonic relationship where they protect each other from each other's world. ""R"" is a horder who lives in a plane. Julie's dad (John Malkovich) is the leader of zombie killers. The introduction of young kids with pseudo patriotic themes is a satire of the ""Red Dawn"" movies.

There are some questions that arise.
1) How do the skeletons, i.e. ""bonies"" stay together without falling apart?
2) How does a record player operate after 8 years into a zombie apocalypse with no electricity?
3) How does a person see their own face in their own memory?

And, not only does over-eager teenage hormonalism turn the living dead into not-so-dead, it affects all the bystander zombies, too. I mean, all the ones who don't have a cute non-zombie girlfriend of their own - they get better just watching. (As a wise man once said, 'Voyeurism is participation.' I guess that when the teenage girlfriend is cute enough, that's all it takes.)

So, we have the star-crossed teenaged lovers with parents who just don't understand. We have them mysteriously un-crossing their stars through The Power of Love (chaste version). And it just happens that their names are Julia and something that starts with R, but no one can remember what. (Get it? Julia and R? Get it?)

5519899,4,B00AW9M54I,"When we imagine a post-apocalyptic world, it usually includes a lot of broken down buildings, stray dogs and a bunch of raggedy and tough survivors, but rarely zombies! Warm Bodies, rated PG-13, is a hilarious look at what could be, a world in which humans are uncommon and zombies roam the land looking for fresh bodies to eat.

This may not sound appealing, but according to KIDS FIRST! Film Critic, Raven D, it's actually quite hilarious. And if you aren't squeamish about the idea of zombies, then you might consider this film for some mid-winter entertainment. As a quirky romance / comedy / horror film, it stands to remind us of the true meaning of humanity and the importance of staying connected with others.

Raven's video review is available at kidsfirst dot org.

The newest addition to the Zombie, Romance, Comedy and Horror genre. I call it, a Zombromance, or a Zomedy! It's set in a post apocalyptic world consisting of zombies, bonies and a small population of humans. When a zombie named R (Nicholas Hoult) meets a Human girl named Julie, he starts to feel like there is more to life than just being the walking dead. He begins to cure himself, retrain himself to talk and become more human. He inspires more zombies to try to cure themselves, and slowly they begin to become more human. Will R and Julie defy the odds and stay together, or will the fact that one of them is a zombie keep them apart?

I absolutely adore this movie. I will definitely see it over and over again. When I think of zombie movies I think of nasty rotting creatures and lots of blood and gore. Naturally the zombies eat people in this movie, but it is filmed in such a way that brought a sense of humor to the whole thing and the blood was very minimal. Even the zombies don't look that bad. In fact, Nicholas Hoult makes one attractive zombie! I like the lighting and sets in this film a lot. You can definitely tell that it is a post apocalyptic world, but the zombies still try to maintain somewhat consistent routines. I thought it was cool too see zombie security guards and janitors. Although they weren't doing much, you still got the sense that there was some humanity left in them.

My favorite character is R because he is such a sweetheart. He goes against his urge to eat people to save Julie and he proves that he is more than just a mindless flesh eater. Even though he is relearning how to speak, he is still quite slow so he can only mutter out simple words and phrases. Nicholas Hoult does a fantastic job keeping this character dull and Zombie-like, while still giving glimpses of his emotions and personality. This movie shows that R still has completely normal thoughts, he just can't express them, as if he is trapped in his own mind. R voiced over most of the movie and it was hilarious to hear what he was thinking, compared to what he was actually able to do. He made me laugh even in more intense situations, making him my absolute favorite character.

I can't say I have a favorite scene because this whole movie is incredibly well done. I do love all the times that R and his Zombie friend M or ""Marcus"" interact. They try to communicate and connect and it's so funny and touching to see their friendship show even though it's challenging for them to express it. I also really enjoy the seen when Julie (Teresa Palmer) and her friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton) give R a makeover. R is so reluctant to have makeup put on him, which I thought was funny because most teenage boys are. The music in this scene was particularly funny and entertaining and it is a memorable scene.

I think there are so many underlying messages in this film, but the one that stands out to me most is that we need to take the time to connect with our surroundings and the people in our lives. In this film it shows a flashback to the world before the zombie outbreak, and R is saying that back then everyone could connect, but in the flashback everyone is on their phones texting or playing video games. It is a really strong reminder that we are so wired and constantly tuned into technology that we often forget to be with our family and connect with our loved ones.

I recommend this film for ages 13 and up because teens and even adults will love this movie, but kids under the age of 13 may find it to be too mature. I give Warm Bodies 5 out of 5 stars so go check it out.

Besides, this movie comes from the studio that released the whole Twilight Saga, but the trailer was so promising I decided to take a risk, and I'm glad I did. This unconventional (but refreshing) story delivers everything that a romance movie should have: funny moments, drama, twists and Nicholas and Teresa's chemistry is undeniable. The soundtrack is also pretty amazing and now I want to get the book!

5519923,4,B00AW9M54I,"Directed by Jonathan Levine, from a screenplay he adapted from the novel by Isaac Marion, Warm Bodies is one of those weird cross-genre films - A romantic zombie flick? Really? - that has the potential to be either truly fun or truly awful.  Fortunately for everyone concerned, Warm Bodies is truly fun.  It's also a really well done film, the all too rare kind where the direction, the script, the actors, the cinematography and the make-up and effects, all mesh together perfectly and make the resulting whole far more than the sum of its parts.

Set in a genre-standard post-apocalyptic near-future where the world has been overrun by zombies and what's left of humanity has retreated to fortress-like enclaves, the film begins with an inner monologue narration from the mind - or what's left of it - of a walking-dead boy (superbly played by Nicholas Hoult) named ""R"".  (He used to have a name but all he can remember now is that it began with an ""R"".)  In a hilariously deadpan stream of consciousness, he tells us about his existence - you can't really call it ""life"" after all - shuffling around an abandoned airport, bumping into other zombies, and periodically getting hungry and going off after the only thing zombies ever seem to eat - humans.  The only connection R has is to another zombie named ""M"" (Rob Corddry), who, like him, still possesses a flicker of brain activity:

""This is my best friend. By best friend I mean we occasionally grunt and stare awkwardly at each other. We even have almost conversations sometimes. Days pass this way but sometimes we even find actual words, words like 'hungry' and 'city.' ""

R also has connections to a handful of objects he finds - snow globes, vinyl records and such - and keeps in a derelict jet he hangs out in when he not busy shuffling around and going off to eat people.  He's not even sure why he keeps them anymore except that, now and then, they seem to stir some memory or echo of a memory in him. Which helps keep him from sliding further down the zombie slope, at the bottom of which are the ""bonies"" -  desiccated, skin-covered skeletons with no trace of humanity left.  ""They'll eat anything with a heartbeat,"" R tells us, immediately adding ""I mean, I will too, but at least I'm conflicted about it.""

Not too far from the airport is a former sports stadium that a group of humans led by General Grigio (John Malkovich) has turned into a walled fortress.  Periodically they have to send out foraging parties into the city to scrounge for things like medical supplies.  Young people are recruited to be the foragers, mainly because they can run the fastest, an important survival trait in any zombie apocalypse. One of these parties that gets sent out includes Grigio's daughter, Julie (a very convincing Teresa Palmer), her boyfriend Perry (Dave Franco), and her best friend Nora (Analeigh Tipton).

And as fate would have it, when R and M and a gaggle of other zombies go shuffling out of the airport in search of human flesh, they stumble across Julie and her fellow scroungers in an abandoned pharmacy.  During the fight, R ends up killing and eating Perry's brain (to be fair though, this was after Perry shot him).  As R explains, one of the reasons zombies are so drawn to eat brains is because by doing so, they experience, at least temporarily, the memories of the person they're eating.  It's the closest thing they can experience to being alive once more, hence their monomaniacal interest in craving brains.  And having eaten Perry's brain, the moment R encounters Julie and their eyes meet, he experiences Perry's love for her, immediately feeling compelled not to eat her but to save her, setting into motion a chain of events that will change them and everyone around them.

There's a not-so-subtle undercurrent of Romeo and Juliet worked into the plot - sans most of the angst - which you can see in the names of the principal characters:  ""R"" for Romeo, ""Julie"" for Juliet, ""M"" for Mercutio, ""Perry"" for Paris (especially if you use the French pronunciation, i.e. Pa-ree), and ""Nora"", who wants to be a nurse, for The Nurse. It may sound a bit cheesy, but it's cleverly done and it works surprisingly well.

The performaces are quite good for the most part. Nicholas Hoult (About a Boy, X-Men: First Class) shines as R, managing to be appropriately dead-faced and shuffling as a zombie while allowing his flicker of humanity to be seen first solely through his eyes, then slowly and gradually becoming more expressive as his contact with Julie causes him to change.  Teresa Palmer (December Boys, I am Number Four) brings believability to Julie, showing a wary toughness that marks her as a survivor but also a willingness to see the changes in R and to respond to them. It also doesn't hurt that Palmer is actually athletic enough to make her running scenes look authentic - you have no trouble believing that this girl could indeed outrun a pack of hungry zombies. Rob Corddry (Hot Tub Time Machine, Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) is subtly effective as R's fellow zombie M, in whom the changes being wrought are more visible and in some ways more keenly felt. On the slightly minus side, John Malkovich plays his General Grigio as something of a stock Malkovich portrayal, the kind you're familiar with from a lot of his movies, from Con Air and Red to Burn Before Reading. It's not bad, but you never get a sense that you're seeing anything but John Malkovich going through his paces. The film would probably have been better off with someone less well known in the role.

For those of you who've read the book, the film follows the book reasonably closely.  The film is, I think, lighter in tone in a number of places.  Perry's role has been trimmed a fair amount to keep the focus on R and Julie.  And the hierarchy between the bonies and ordinary zombies isn't as clearly drawn.  The only reason I don't rate this a full five stars though is because of one significant difference in how the climactic confrontation plays out for the main characters.  I won't spoil anything by laying it out, but it'll be obvious to anyone who's read the book and I think the film would've been better if it had followed the book in this case.

But all that said, it's remarkable at how well Warm Bodies actually works as a film. It stays true to the basic tropes of the zombie apocalypse genre, making it work for zombie-film fans, but also manages to blend in both comedic and romantic elements in a believable way, making it work in those genres as well.

Highly recommended as, however improbable this must sound, a fun romantic zombie film that everyone can enjoy.",1360108800,56,6661,4.657849829351536
5519924,4,B00AW9M54I,"A remarkably gentle, _completely_ PG-13 appropriate, ""post apocalyptic love story"" between a young zombie who can only remember that his name once began with ""R"" and a young human teenager/young adult named Julie with a ""super overprotective dad"" ;-). Such a cute story! I'm just in ""aw[...]"" ;-)",1359936000,,296,5.1875
5519925,4,B00AW9M54I,"For fans of zombie movies, the first thing you need to know about WARM BODIES is that it is rated PG-13.  This is very much not a movie about the gore, or brain eating or limb rending.  It's a gently amusing love story, which instead of featuring a couple that is mis-matched because one is rich and the other poor, or one is old and the other young, or one is a Capulet and the other a Montague, in this case one is a zombie and the other is still alive.

WARM BODIES is a zombie movie for people who aren't necessarily big zombie movie fans or for big zombie movies fans who don't mind a zombie-mythology that isn't well explored (or even makes a lot of sense).  If you're a hard core fan who spends a lot of time parsing out the differences between Romero's zombies as opposed to the zombies in THE DEAD...or if you thought ZOMBIELAND made a mockery of your beloved genre...then stay away.  Otherwise, prepare for a  low-key, charming treat.

We're introduced to our central character, a zombie named ""R"" as he shuffles around an airport full of fellow zombies and we get to hear his internal narrative.  He's our guide through all of this...so at no point is ""R"" a mindless, soul-less...well, zombie.  He's more like a human who is trapped inside the body of a zombie.  He doesn't really like to have to eat other people...but he does get a bit of a guilty charge out of eating brains, because he also eats their memories and feelings.  ""R"" was also a young man when he was changed...so when he bumps into an attractive, but living, girl named Julie...his romantic interest in her is far stronger than his desire to consume her.

He leads her to his ""lair"" inside an old commercial airliner and insists she stay there for awhile, so he can keep her safe.  She complies, and the two forge an unusual but nicely touching friendship.  They little details of their courtship are quite fun, and in general, the best scenes in the film feature just these two together.  Relative unknown Teresa Palmer (SORCEROR'S APPRENTICE) is charming without being too sweet, and best of all is Nicholas  Hoult as ""R.""  Hoult first appeared on the scene as the dreadfully awkward kid in ABOUT A BOY (an overlooked classic, if you haven't seen it) but seems to have managed to escape the ""child actor"" blues and is forging a nice career for himself in young adult roles.  He's unconventional looking, and this helps his performance.  His ""R"" is soulful but also always looks slightly startled...as though he's expecting to be shot at any moment or is still stunned to find he is a zombie.  The chemistry these two share is terrific.

The film is essentially their relationship...but because it's a medium budget film, it's also about trying to convince the ""powers that be"" on both sides that zombie/human love is okay.  In fact, the film is about how ""the power of love"" can overcome some pretty huge obstacles...not exactly a new message, but you've NEVER seen it play out in this scenario.  Major points for originality.

I won't get into much more of the plot, except to say the film is at its weakest when attempting actions scenes.  They include some mediocre CGI and some undramatic confrontations between humans and zombies.  This is the only spot where the PG-13 rating hurts...the zombies never seem to do any serious damage.  The film simply doesn't generate much suspense in the more action oriented scenes.

The supporting characters are quite minor, but standouts include Rob Corddry as R's best friend and quirky Analeigh Tipton as Julie's BFF.  Tipton, in particular, gets to have some fun late in the film.  However, the film also commits the sin of wasting John Malkovich.  Next to Christopher Walken, is there an actor alive who gives better crazy, zany, weird, wacky, etc.?  Well, Malkovich is asked to play things straight as the military leader of the humans...and in the end, all I did was hanker to see the upcoming sequel to RED, where he will no doubt steal the show once again.

WARM BODIES is a gentle movie.  It doesn't have the over-the-top laughs of ZOMBIELAND.  It doesn't concern itself with homage as did SHAUN OF THE DEAD.  It simply takes zombies and explores what would happen if zombie weren't completely given over to mindless eating.  Few gut-busting moments...but many wry observations and sweet moments.  A date move for zombie lovers.  What could be wrong with that?",1359936000,,4392,4.684073107049608
5519926,4,B00AW9M54I,"We've all heard that classic story about the star-crossed lovers. You know, the one where that guy falls in love with the girl and they must overcome impossible odds in order to be together. Warm Bodies is exactly that story, only with a twist; cause, well, he happens to be a zombie and she's still human. R (Nicholas Hoult) isn't your average zombie. Sure, he'll eat your brains and all, but at least he feels bad about it. Julie (Teresa Palmer) kills zombies and when her boyfriend is eaten by one, she's forced to put her life into his hands. Lucky for her, it's R. After saving her life, R and Julie form a special bond as she struggles to survive and he learns what it is to be human again. Slowly, they fall in love and manage to exhume hope for all humanity --- both alive and dead.

Since first seeing the trailer for Warm Bodies, I knew it was a movie I had to watch. The fact that it's based off a popular book of the same name is just a sweet bonus. Warm Bodies is sort of a cross between Romeo & Juliet and Zombieland. Not quite a comedy and not quite a romance, it's a story that's about the power of human connections in a dead, desolate world. Levine has demonstrated an uncanny ability to bring poignancy and warmth to the most unlikely genre fusing zombies, humour and intelligence in to one satiating 97 minute showing. And though it is a zombie film, it's important to note that few of the a-typical zombie tropes stand. But fear not, because the deviations work and help to make the movie a big success.

The best thing about Warm Bodies, though, is the cast. Hoult charms as the undead, love sick R and Palmer is radiant as the curiously bold Julie. Together they have a flirtatious chemistry that makes you believe the impossibility of their precarious relationship. Palmer reminds me of a young Natalie Portman both in looks and in spirit. She exudes that naive innocence and hopefulness that is so characteristic of Shakespeare's Juliet, while updating the performance with a bad-assery and curiosity that keeps you rooting for her. Hoult, on the other hand, is uber talented. I have a feeling he'll end up one of those underrated actors, much like Jesse Eisenberg --- so much potential and not enough credit but perhaps this movie will change all that. It's Hoult's charisma and the subtle nuances of his physical performance that make him the one to watch. He's engaging and funny and compassionate, everything you want in a modern-day Romeo.

Warm Bodies also has a strong supporting cast, consisting of the funny Rob Corddry,  Analeigh Tipton of Top Model fame and the notorious John Malkovich. They each hold their own and do a decent job but it's clear why they're the supporting cast. They along with the Bonies sub-plot serve solely to move the storyline forward. Here Hoult is the star, carrying the picture from start to finish. It's hard to be original in the zombie genre, but Levine with help from Marion's witty screenplay, manages to keep it fresh, despite the masses of undead. The comedy is more of the observational kind, delivered mostly through R's inner monologue. Also, the use of music in the movie is incredibly ironic and perfectly timed, earning many a laugh from myself and the rest of the audience. All in all, I can sufficiently say that I adored this movie. There's no doubt about it, Warm Bodies is a zombie flick with brains and heart.

Food for Thought: Warm Bodies is a quirky and unconventional zombie flick that will bring a beat to even the deadest of hearts. Rich with potential, this movie takes a tragic classic and turns it into a warm and hopeful rom-com, sans the traditional sap. Warm Bodies is funny, earnest and sweet with all the addictiveness of Twilight, only it's so much more well-executed. If the on-screen version is this good, I can't wait to see what the novelisation has in store for me next!",1359936000,4,3873,4.615384615384615
5519927,5,B00AW9M54I,"Warm Bodies is a funny and charming, sweet and touching story about a lonely Zombie named ""R"", who wants a little more out of his undead life.  He just wants to connect with someone.  What I loved about this movie is that it does not take itself seriously even though it points out that we are all Zombies living in our own little boxes constantly talking on our cell phones and not paying attention to those around us.

Along with the sweet and endearing, there is an equal amount of humor. Adapted from the beautifully written and poignant novel by Isaac Marion, Warm Bodies has something for everyone. I really enjoyed this movie and saw it on Friday and again on Sunday, I loved it that much. It's a little bit Shaun of the Dead meets Romeo and Juliet.

""R"" (the adorable and talented Nicholas Hoult) along with his best friend and fellow Zombie ""M"" (funny man Rob Corddry) embark on a hunting trip to the city with their other undead brethren, where R kills a man named Perry (Dave Franco), consumes his brain and experiences his memories and sees and instantly falls for his victim's girlfriend Julie(Teresa Palmer).  He saves Julie's life, takes her back to his lair, an airplane in an abandoned airport.  They form an uneasy friendship that becomes something more and his connection to Julie sparks a change in R that just might be key to saving the world.

Not only was it fun and entertaining, but there is a clear lesson to be learned from R.  It's better to live than to merely survive.  Warm Bodies is a fantastic movie and I can't recommend it enough.",1359936000,,1565,4.540925266903915
5519928,4,B00AW9M54I,"Unfortunately you have to venture out in the cold to enjoy a movie entitled ""Warm Bodies"" and then you come to realize that the movie is mostly about `cold' bodies, the dead undead. Nicholas Hoult (""X-Men: First Class"" and the upcoming ""Jack the Giant Slayer"") plays a zombie with thoughts named R, a name given because he can only remember that his human name started with an `R'. We're introduced to his thoughts early on and we see his desire to be something better than the feeble-brained stumbling zombie that he is. That, in a nutshell, is all you need to know.

Just when you thought that zombie movies would probably never go away, but would never do anything remotely original, ""Warm Bodies"" shatters that. The movie is a tremendously creative twist on the genre. The zombie with thoughts gimmick goes a long way for director Jonathan Levine, but the movie as a whole stayed routine and didn't try to push the envelope much further. That being said, the soul of this movie isn't in the plot lines that it tells, but the search for life.

I'm not sure if ""Warm Bodies"" is intending a deep message among its dry humor and romance, but a deep message may be its biggest asset. As R goes about his everyday zombie routine, he stumbles across a band of humans looking for medication and in that band is Julie Grigio (Teresa Palmer ""Take Me Home Tonight"", ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice""). R instant becomes infatuated with the obviously attractive, tough-willed and vulnerable Julie. As the two of them bond in some pretty strange ways, the movie becomes a healing type movie. It becomes a slow walk toward humanity and life. The movie, about zombies, makes a pretty clear message that in a way, we all have zombie traits. Whether it be walking through life on our smart phones or just not living fully while we are here, ""Warm Bodies"" shows that we are all zombies, at times.

I'm not completely sure that ""Warm Bodies"" is a smash hit or anything. To me, the story was way too routine and not challenging enough. Yet, the human and not-so-human elements of the film are top notch. The one thing I will say for ""Warm Bodies"" is that this is the kind of movie that will have a cult following and years from now, people will still enjoy watching it. It's nice little film that has more heart than most movies deserve. Most importantly, it's a movie about living, reminding us all not to take that for granted.",1359936000,2,2407,4.593023255813954
5519929,4,B00AW9M54I,"Here is the first surprise of 2013 and it's another zombie movie.  Well, not your typical zombie movie.  It's a bit of a romantic comedy.  Confused?  Well, me too.  My first inclination was to stay away.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some zombies in film going back to the slow walkers of George Romero.

In this take, a cataclysmic event has struck the world and turned most humans into the undead.  They appear to be just like your stereotypical zombies.  But there is also another zombie type.  One that has eventually eaten his or her own body parts and exists as a skeleton known as ""bonies.""  We learn this from our zombie hero known as ""R"" (excellent Nicholas Hoult).  He can't remember his full name but he thinks it begins with an R.  ""R"" is our guide and narrator and he's witty and smarter than your typical zombie.  He, along with his best zom-buddy ""M"" (Rob Corddry) communicate with a few grunts and groans and eventually they eke out a few words.

While on a search for dinner they come across a gaggle of young humans, themselves out gunning for zombies.  Violence ensues and ""R"" manages to kill and consume one of the young men (Dave Franco).  One of the results of a zombie eating a human brain is the victim's memories float around in the zombies mind, kind of like a dream.  ""R"" sees a young woman (Teresa Palmer) who is also the girlfriend of his last meal.  About to be somebody's desert, ""R"" rescues her and takes her back to his home in an abandon airplane.

As time moves on ""R"" develops feelings and a sense of responsibility for Julie (Palmer).  Something has stirred body chemicals and slowly, he is changing.  This is a surprisingly charming and funny movie probably aimed at the ""Twilight"" admirers.  But it also has a terrific script, a couple with true charisma and an interesting twist on the whole zombie genre.  Congrats to Jonathan Levine (""50/50"") for an excellent screenplay and wonderful direction...and a nice new year surprise.

BLU RAY UPDATE:  The Blu ray transfer is in 1080p with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  It looks very good although there is some definite color alterations in the original film that carry over here.  The bad zombies (Boneys) look pretty lame in the CGI department and this transfer shows that detail more so than I remember in the theater.  The audio comes in a very nice DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 soundtrack.  It provides an immersive if not quite spectacular audio experience.  While the subs rumble a bit during the various zombie attacks the track is a bit short of perfection.  There is a slew of extras including an audio commentary with the director and one of the actors, some interviews, 6 various ""making of"" features, a 12 minute ""home movie"" by cutie Teresa Palmer, zombie acting tips, some deleted scenes, a gag reel and a trailer.",1359936000,6,2805,4.626774847870182
