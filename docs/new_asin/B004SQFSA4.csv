8440115,3,B004SQFSA4,"I thought the movie was a bit dry, and not too great. No narrator or anything, just Johnny and Lyman talking about their lives and doing things that other couples do. But give the two credit. Their relationship has lasted longer than most straight Hollywood romances.",1486080000,,267,4.826086956521739
8440116,5,B004SQFSA4,This documentary is inspiring and moving. I hope there is a sequel so we can see more of Johnny and Lyman's relationship as even in this short video I already felt attached and invested in these two people. The filmmakers did an incredible job of bringing a personal touch to the issue of gay marriage.,1311379200,,302,4.509090909090909

What a wonderful tale about love! The filmmaker adeptly captures the essence of Johnny's and Lyman's union.

8440118,5,B004SQFSA4,"A fascinating insight into the life of two amazing men.  A wonderful love story  and a history lesson too!  I was delighted to share this film with a group of folks in Des Moines, Iowa who are working to maintain our right to legally marry.  I showed it at a gathering of mixed gay and straight and the response was the same for all.  Johnny and Lyman are an inspiration to any marriage.  I appreciated the very relaxed and intimate style of the interviews.  I liked Johnny and Lyman right away.  Their story warmed my heart at their meeting,  brought tears to my eyes at their wedding and made me cheer as their community recognized them as models of commitment!  Well done!",1300752000,4,675,4.459016393442623
8440119,5,B004SQFSA4,"I saw this at the San Diego Film Festival and was really touched by the story.  Johnny & Lyman's relationship has stood the test of time and is an amazing, inspirational story.  I really enjoyed the interviews with the two of them.  I loved watching two people interact with each other who have been so in love for more than 65 years!  They offered sage advice for a lasting relationship, and I cried my eyes out when they got married.  Great film!",1300752000,4,448,4.414634146341464
