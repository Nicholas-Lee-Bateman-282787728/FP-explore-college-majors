2439359,5,B000BRM9A6,"""Here Comes the Clown"" is a great DVD for kids.  But what really surprised me is how much my wife and I laughed too!  The quality is excellent and the pacing keeps you enthralled the whole time.  Boswick the Clown is fantastic!  I highly recommend watching the ""Behind the Scenes 2"" section also.",1130457600,5,296,4.528301886792453
2439360,5,B000BRM9A6,If your looking for a funny video that kids will watch over and over...this is it.  It's about time we have a clown video that reminds us why everyone loves a clown. It reminds me of classic comedy like when I was a kid.  This DVD makes a great gift for your kids too.,1130371200,4,268,3.9444444444444446
2439361,5,B000BRM9A6,"We got a copy of ""Here Comes the Clown"",and my two girls have not stop watching it, they play it over and over again. Its  really fun to watch Phoebe and Boswick go out and just have some fun, specially when they stop for ice cream. Another part that I like or should I say that my girls like, is the Family picnic,and asking if we can go to Boswick Family Picnic next time! This is a great DVD for kids and Adults, we recomend it!!!!",1130284800,5,434,4.046511627906977
2439362,5,B000BRM9A6,"I got a copy of ""Here Comes the Clown"" and my twin sons haven't stopped watching it.  The story revolves around a popular children's clown, Boswick Turnstyle, Jr., and his friend Phoebe the duck (yes, a real DUCK!) as they go from adventure to adventure in the ""day of a life of a clown.""  My kids loved silliness (lots of funny dancing and sight gags with props, etc).  My wife and I had a few chuckles too (an old-fashioned clown pie fight shot in black and white reminded us of Our Gang comedies or Laurel and Hardy films.)  It's about time kids of today got to enjoy a funny and entertaining clown!  It's a lost artform.  This DVD is good, clean, entertaining fun.  I definitely recommend it!",1130284800,5,696,4.433070866141732
8091610,5,B000BRM9A6,"This is my first time to watch a ""clown"" DVD not really sure what to expect, but I got it for my 8 year old thinking it would be cute for his age. Surprisingly, as we watched together, I found it to be quite a funny show. It really is quite different from anything else I've normally watched and it had me and my son waiting for what would happen next while laughing through the whole show. It's not too long, only a half hour and I highly recommend it as a good, wholesome comedy especially for children.",1298246400,,505,4.163265306122449
8091611,5,B000BRM9A6,"Usually we have some idea of a DVD's contents before we view it...but with this one we had no idea what to expect. Well, we were pleasantly surprised to find a unique type of entertainment for kida and adults alike.

The DVD stars Boswick the Clown and his little waddling sidekick, Phoebe. Boswick gets up in the morning, but cannot remember that he has a show to do at noon. So, he goes on with his daily activities, and has fun scuba diving in his bathtub, getting dressed, shaving, having breakfast with an endless stream of milk...but he still can't remember what he's supposed to do. Even juggling doesn't help jog his memory. He dances, and even falls asleep! Pat in the Hat even calls to remind him about the show, but he cannot hear what he's saying. Day dreaming about a clown family gathering also doesn't help. But then he sees a sign while walking outside, that reminds him of where he has to be. After his car runs out of gas, and arriving at the wrong theater, Boswick finally arrives to perform his clown show.

MyParenTime.com recommends this DVD -- Boswick has a unique style that combines slapstick comedy with child-like humor. The settings are colorful and inviting, and the use of sound effects add a lot to each scene. Phoebe the Duck is so cute, but we think she deserves more lines :). The DVD includes extras such as bloopers, and coloring pages to print out on computer. Both children and parents will enjoy having a front-row seat to their very own clown show.",1222300800,,1488,4.569288389513108
8091612,5,B000BRM9A6,"This DVD is awesome!  Funny, hilarious, well-made movie.  It will keep youngsters and adults entertained.  Can't wait for the sequel.",1189555200,2,133,5.55
8091613,5,B000BRM9A6,"My 2 year old loves Boswick. This is the only movie he will sit still and watch.  His 6 year old brother and 8 year old sister love it also.  They love watching all to colors, the props and, of course, Phoebe.  It is the only time I can get the three of them to agree on one movie, so it gives me some peace and quiet.",1170892800,2,318,3.716417910447761
8091614,5,B000BRM9A6,"I gave this DVD to my granddaughter about a month ago. She loved it immediately and has played it again and again. She even wanted to recreate some of the scenes, so I had to tell her I did not have access to cream pies. It's a wonderful movie; I hope he does more.",1158883200,,265,3.925925925925926
8091615,5,B000BRM9A6,"My six year old daughter and eight year old son were full of giggles from beginning to end.  Here Comes The Clown is a very creative story, and Boswick is hilarious (the duck isn't bad, either).  Many of my friends have purchased and enjoyed the DVD, too.  I had Boswick come to the church I pastor for a special event.  They were absolutely captivated by Boswick, and so were their parents.  His act was great, and his humor kept adults engaged, too.  Get the DVD and enjoy this with your kids or grandkids!  - Rev. Peter Shaw, Napa, CA",1144195200,2,537,4.363636363636363
8091616,5,B000BRM9A6,"What a funny and original movie!

I'm a stay-at-home mother of two baby boys.  My oldest is 21 months old and ever since we added ""Here Comes the Clown"" to our DVD collection, I have been freed up to nurse my 4 month old, cook dinner and even take a shower IN PEACE. (Come on all you moms out there!)

He LOVES Boswick and is glued to the screen when I put the DVD on.  At the end, he will beg to watch it again.

My husband and I love to watch ""Here Comes the Clown"" too.  There are treasures in the detail; great cinematography; classic humor; total fun. You've got to see it!  A+++",1143504000,2,584,4.026086956521739
8091617,5,B000BRM9A6,"Employing classic clown capers with a hip modern twist, Here Comes the Clown is sure to bring out the child in you and put your children in stitches. It's all here: funny props, plentiful pies and a clown family reunion. I'm giving a copy to every kid in my family.",1141430400,3,265,4.32
8091618,5,B000BRM9A6,"""Ms. Jacobs, it's raining! Does this mean that during recess we get to watch the clown dvd again?""

This dvd is the perfect balance between funny, lively and somehow very calming for my students. They loved it.  Boswick is more than just entertaining, he is mesmerizing. As a teacher, I appreciate how Boswick gives kids someone to laugh at and laugh with. They really need that.

Here Comes the Clown is not only filled with goofy sweetness, but also goofy sophistication which gives kids (and adults!) the satisfaction really ""getting"" the jokes and gags.

I totally recommend this dvd to parents and teachers.

Thank you, Boswick and Crew.",1135209600,4,642,4.907407407407407
8091619,5,B000BRM9A6,"""Here Comes The Clown"" is a fun-loving, sweet, and charming depiction of a day in the life of an absent minded clown.  Boswick and his duck Phoebe really capture that lovable humorous essence of clowning that has fascinated young and old alike for centuries.  There is also a nostalgic silent film sequence that provides children with a glimpse into the past.  What a treat for kids that may have never experienced the antics of the likes of Buster Keaton or Laurel and Hardy.  Lots of love went into this production.  I would highly recommend it for anyone with young children.",1134518400,3,578,4.74
