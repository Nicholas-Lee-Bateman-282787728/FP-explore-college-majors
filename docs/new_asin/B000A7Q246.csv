I got as a gift from my sister when she went to USA, and I loved it a lot...The long episode Abra-Catastrophe is very fun and entertaining, and as it's so long, lots of things happen, so you can watch it over and over and over again and you never get sick of it. And for those times when you don't want to see this long episode, you can watch the Timmy's Top Wishes DVD, it has 7 13-mins episodes, and the ones they selected to include here are very good, my favorite episodes are ""Where's Wanda"", ""Boys In The Band"" and ""Pipe Down"" (one of the 2 bonus episodes).",1140566400,2,631,4.172131147540983
