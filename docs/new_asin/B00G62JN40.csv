Excellent TV series. I was a bit surprised that The original Wanda from S1 did not continue. She, IMO, she fit the part better than the new  actress. She was replaced.",1421020800,,240,4.558139534883721

The story lines keep the viewer engaged and wanting more without, at least so far, sacrificing general historical accuracy. Too view movies have covered the Polish Underground/Home Army [the largest most intricate such force in WWII] so I'm excited about watching this one [Note: another good one to catch if you are interested in this stuff is the movie/DVD KANAL.] It would have been a nice touch if the German soldiers/officials spoke German instead of Polish, but it's not that big a deal, and the English subtitles are easy to follow and not intrusive. One minor criticism is the periodic insertion of pre-war soap opera-like romantic flashbacks, but again, that doesn't detract from the overall high quality of the series.

Now to the important part---normally when I check the Amazon reviews, I'm not looking for a movie critique about the story/acting as I usually already have that covered. I want to know if the DVD/Blu-ray audio-visual characteristics are good or suck, so I can determine if it's worth buying the movie, upgrading from one format to another, or just waiting for a better remastered version to come out etc. In the case of Czas Honoru (Days of Honor) Season 1,2,3,4,5 (20-DVD) PAL, I can say it's a definite thumbs up! The picture generally has vibrant natural colors with a full sound stage experience [not 7.1 by any stretch, but still engaging.] Just make sure your player can handle the Euro-format and you should be good to go...And now I'm gonna try to knock off two more episodes and finish off season one---If I run into problems down the line that change my views stated here I'll try to provide an update...Hope this helps!

UPDATE: Now that I've completed Seasons 1-6 [and am starting Season 7] I can definitely say this the best coverage of the subject matter that I have ever watched, and one of my favorite all time TV series in any category. The story is very engaging, the characters are well acted, and the sets are movie quality---NOT some low-budget cheesy made-for-TV stuff. This goes as well for the DVD video/audio quality throughout. If I have any concerns at all, they deal whether or not there will be a much needed Season 8 [and I sure hope there is!!!] because if you make it to Season 6's last episode, I think you will want another season to tie up some important loose ends---remember, Season 7 is out of sequence and takes the viewer back from 1946 occupied Poland to the incredible 1944 Warsaw Uprising.  THIS OUTSTANDING SERIES IS WORTH THE TIME AND MONEY---Go for it!!!",1419552000,3,2714,4.770212765957447

8621020,5,B00G62JN40,"As a kid here in Australia I recall my father reading the Sydney Polskie Gazetta.  He translated the stories published there about the experiiences of the Polish armed forces (1939-1945) and the Polish Resistance.  These stories never saw the light of day in the English language.  I recall seeing the odd English documentary, but hardly anything else on the Polish war experience.  Some Polish films made their way here to Australia and have been shown in foriegn movie theatres and on television late at night.  Now through Amazon I can get my hands on quite a number of quality Polish movies covering the Pollsh war experience.  I understand that the Poles are releasing the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 (not to be confused by the far more Hollywood popularised Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943) this coming September.  The trailer is on Internet.  Hopefully, it will be available on Amazon as a DVD soon.

Recently, as I scanned the Amazon UK site I noted this series.  I tried to order the whole lot, but apparently only Seasons 1 & 6 could be sent.  For some reason the Polish distributors stated that the remaining seasons could not be sent to Australia.  So when I noted the availability of this Five Season Box Set, here on Amazon USA, I immediately purchased it and am eagerly awaiting its arrival.  I watched Season I in the space of days as each exciting episode had a cliff hanger to the next.

My investment in this series is paying dividends.  The tension is high and the drama is realistic.  There are no James Bond style antics here as our heroes, trained in England and then parachuted back home to fight and come to grips with a Warsaw where round-ups are frequent, where collabrators lurk and where Ethnic German Poles (Volks Deutche) either help or co-operate with the SS bullies and gendarmes.  Hostages are murdered for assassinations, and the pitiful sight of the Jewish Ghetto, where deadly danger lurks with smuggling food and weapons, is in plain site.  Our heroes engage in all forms of dangerous resistance activities as they try to also keep and eye on their loved ones.  It is a fantastic series, with strong character development and great story arc taking in the resistance movement history to not only in fighting the brute German occupiers, but later the socalled Soviet liberators and their Polish puppet government troops..",1402617600,4,2353,4.822942643391521

We also ordered Season 6, it too continue the excellence of story, actors, and wonderful production values. About the seller. I could not be more pleased by the seller's excellent service. He left nothing to be desired. The Series was shipped from Poland, and was competent, and fast. I will be looking for this sellers other offerings, and will gladly purchase from him again.",1400630400,,471,4.686746987951807
