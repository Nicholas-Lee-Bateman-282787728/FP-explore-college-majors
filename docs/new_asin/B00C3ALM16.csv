5689655,5,B00C3ALM16,"Seems like I waited forever for Reuben, Reuben to come out on DVD. What a joy to watch it again. Everyone in the cast is perfect, but it is Kelly McGillis' stunning film debut that is a treasure to behold and enjoy again!",1399420800,,221,4.162790697674419
5689656,3,B00C3ALM16,This account of a boozing womanizing Scotch poet who pulls up stakes in a New England college town is a decidedly mixed affair.  Whatever gravitas it attains is from the bravura performance by Tom Conti.  Sporting a disheveled mane of hair and a rumpled tweed suit Conti's Gowan McGland is quick with a smirk and a quip at the drop of a hat.  I'd give the film a pass if not for a near deadly downbeat trajectory it takes.  The film also has a strange ending that practically negates the whole enterprise.  A quirky film maybe too quirky for its own good.  For those who need to know Reuben is the name of the dog.,1396569600,,614,4.2956521739130435
5689657,5,B00C3ALM16,"Well written, beautifully acted. I've had this on video for years and never thought is get it on DVD. I'll settle for blu-Ray though!",1387238400,5,133,4.583333333333333
5689658,3,B00C3ALM16,"Only issue is that DVD audio will not work on my older Sony DVD Blu Ray player (~2008)?
Last firmware update was done in 2010. I have not checked to see if there is a Sony update post 2010 available to fix the issue.
Have not had this issue on any other blu ray DVD. Works fine on my LG Blu Ray Player (2011).",1372636800,,309,3.84375

8576973,5,B00C3ALM16,This movie is so well-written and so well-acted. It's been one of my favorite films since it came out.,1470873600,,102,4.421052631578948
8576974,5,B00C3ALM16,Great lost film from the 80's. Bluray is the best way you'll ever see it.,1447286400,,73,3.933333333333333
8576975,4,B00C3ALM16,I'll see anything with Tom Conti and I liked this but it comes across as very much of its period--a little dated.,1433894400,,113,4.181818181818182
8576976,3,B00C3ALM16,"This is a brutal film about a man in decline, a once-gifted poet whose life has degenerated into self pity and debauchery with bored middle-aged women in Connecticut.  He is destructive to everyone around him, yet somehow still attractive and in demand.  Many despise him, particularly the restauranteurs he rips off, but he doesn't care.  If he feels or regrets something, he gets completely drunk.  Then he falls for a girl, a youth who is entering her prime (Kelly McGillis as she was starting out, in an unfortunately rather wooden performance no matter her striking beauty), and begins to see his life the way it is.  I found it profoundly sad.",1431648000,,649,4.8108108108108105

8576978,5,B00C3ALM16,"I am so glad to finally get a digital copy, after having lost my VHS version years ago. This is a great piece of storytelling and I loved every minute of it again. And (with the passing of time) I saw some parts in a new light. Still an all time favourite.",1409443200,3,256,3.9423076923076925
8576979,4,B00C3ALM16,A great little film.,1406592000,,20,4.25
8576980,4,B00C3ALM16,A favorite movie I am very glad to have available.  One star docked only because nothing has really been done to bring the film up to Blu-Ray standards; it's just in Blu-Ray format.  The DVD version would do just fine.,1404259200,,218,4.425
8576981,5,B00C3ALM16,"This is a movie that really lives up to a description like,""Heartwarming, sad, funny, touching and insightful"". Tom Conti plays the loveable lecher who is on a poetry reading tour in New England. For years the film was only available in VHS format. I'm glad that there's a DVD now.",1402358400,,281,4.64
