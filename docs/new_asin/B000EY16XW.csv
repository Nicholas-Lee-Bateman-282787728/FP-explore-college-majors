8164752,5,B000EY16XW,"Harold Reynolds Presents: Baseball Infield Vol. 1, is a must have for any infield player or baseball coach serious about having a great infield game.

Where else can you learn from the Wizard!  Not since Johnny Bench's Baseball Bunch, has Ozzie offered you his secrets and insight into playing the infield.

His tips on the glove, and how to know where you are at all times on the field are priceless gems.  To get this DVD for under 5 dollars was an absolute steal.

The video is about an hour long, but you get a great idea on how two of the best Harold Reynolds and Ozzie Smith played the game.

My advice is buy it, try it, and become the best infielder in your league.

Big ups to Harold Reynolds for doing a series like this to help out the young players.
