2521187,5,B000EHSVG4,"I purchased this for my 6 yr old son because he absolutely loves TMNT and because I feel the originals are better oriented for smaller children.  The newer TMNT versions that are on Saturday mornings or on DVD seem to be more violent and geered towards older children.  As for my son's review of these originals: he says ""Cowabunga, Turtle Power!!!""",1152576000,2,349,4.704918032786885
2521188,5,B000EHSVG4,We have here 12 episodes from the classic 80's cartoon. I loved when I was a child and I never miss them. I think this is the best Lions Gate multiple cartoon Dvd having seen Rambo and Speed Racer. The prize is under $15 so also is a good reason to purchase it. I hope Ghostbusters follow this way soon. CTHV take good note of this. I'll wait for the rest of the series.,1148428800,3,370,4.013513513513513
2521189,5,B000EHSVG4,"Vol. 4 of the original TMNT cartoon covers the next 1/4 of season 3, bringing us to halfway through the season.  This volume is where some alternate voices are brought in for a few of the characters, notably Raph and Don, who both also would voice them in a few future episodes; Raph's in the ""Turtle Terminator"" and an entire storyarc that featured the Turtles vacationing in Europe; Don's in the ""Turtle Terminator"" as well, plus Leatherhead's debut episode and an episode of the Europe arc.

TMNT alum Casey Jones finally gets to make his animated debut in ""Casey Jones: Outlaw Hero.""  He appeared in a few other episodes as well, such as ""Night of the Rogues,"" ""Leonardo Cuts Loose,"" and ""Cyber Turtles.""  On an interesting note, this show's version of Casey was never seen without his trademark hockey mask.

The tenth episode marks Baxter's return in ""Return of the Fly.""  Interestingly enough, it also features the Rat King as a somewhat ally for the Turtles, who briefly appears to give them some info when Shredder captures April yet again.  Personally, I liked this development for him, as it made his true allegiences unclear.  While he would still appear to menace the green teens, he would also appear in other episodes like this one to unexpectedly give the Turtles info or advice.  Too bad his character was all but runied in season 8 when he was turned into a trench-coat and fedora clad gun-toting assassin.

This also has one of my favorite episodes in the series, and hands down the funniest: Cowabunga Shredhead.  In it, Shredder and Krang attempt to make duplicates of the world leaders in order to take over the world.  Shredder also attempts to make a duplicate of Michelangelo in order to infiltrate the Turtles and destroy them.  Thanks to Bebop and Rocksteady's usual meddling though, everything goes wrong and in the end Shredder winds up thinking he's the real Michelangelo.  Shredder's moments believing he's the orange-clad turtle are absolutely hilarious, and hands down some of the best-written humor I've seen on television.  The scene where he screams, ""Turtle Power!"" at the top of his lungs alone is priceless.

Like with volume 3, I think the actual animated main menu is incredibly cool looking, and it's great that the video quality has increased with each volume(compare this to vol. 1's grainy quality).  Sadly, I'd at least like to see a few extras.  Maybe some interviews with the writers or VAs, or how the cartoon was able to last a whopping 10 seasons, or even the classic TMNT toy commercials that featured clips of the cartoon with dubbed-over dialoge.  Oh well, hopefully Lion's Gate finally realizes this sooner than later.  Until then, I'm at least happy that I can add yet another classic childhood memory to my DVD collection.",1145318400,14,2779,4.859872611464968
2521190,4,B000EHSVG4,"Ok ive noticed that a few reviewers were questioning the fact that Raphael and Donatello have different voices in a few episodes. There is nothing wrong with your DVDs, the reason their voices sound different is because the people doing their voices were different.  For whatever reason Rob Paulsen and Barry Gordon, who usually voiced Raphael and Donatello, were not there at the recording of those episodes.  Each character had their own back up actor in case someone was absent for the recording of the episode, so that is all it is.  Since the 1989 Season had so many episodes that happends from time to time with Donatello (and Bebop), Raphael, Shredder and Krang. So for future releases don't be surprised if you notice that again.  After the 1989 Season most of the usual voice actors were there for the recordings except for some of the last seasons.  So anyway, sorry for the long explanation but that is what it is so everyone knows.

As far as the DVD goes, I still think Artisan should have just released the whole 1989 Season in a boxset (like most tv shows) instead of these twice a year, 12 episode, dvds. But I can't complain too much since they are releasing all of them in order, even though it will take years before all the episodes are out.  The quality of the episodes are good but everything else is just pretty much bare bones. It would be nice if there were at least a few extras included, but again it is still nice they continue to release TMNT on DVD.  With a cheap price it is a good purchase, but just don't expect anything exstensive.",1144368000,18,1565,4.524822695035461
2521191,5,B000EHSVG4,"I use to love watching TMNT when I was younger just like many other people, the new turtles cartoons are pure crap.

I've only watched the first 3 episodes of this DVD so far and I noticed the same thing, first Raphael had different voice then next episode Donatello. Not sure why, maybe someone else will have an answer.",1144281600,3,321,4.440677966101695
2521192,4,B000EHSVG4,"I've only watched the first few episodes on this 4th volume, but I was wondering what happened to the Turtles voices? In the first episode, ""Ninja Sword of Nowhere"", Raphael's voice is way different and in the next episode Donatello's voice is off. Is there something wrong with my copy or is it like this on other people's discs? Just wondering if anyone knew what the deal was with that.",1144281600,4,389,4.571428571428571
2521193,5,B000EHSVG4,"Finally they started to speed things up with the releases. The original TMNT is the best cartoon I have ever seen. It is filled with action and humour. The episodes are well written and are never boring. It's so much better then the 2003 TMNT, were the humor is seriously lacking. These 12 episodes are part of the best season of the entire run. I'm looking forward seeing these episodes again. The Turtles, Splinter, April, Shredder and Krang are at top form. Baxter Stockman returnes with a vengenge and Casey Jones is introduced. The Rat King also returns. The episodes included on this release are:

THE NINJA SWORD OF NOWHERE
20,000 LEAKS UNDER THE CITY
TAKE ME TO YOUR LEADER
THE FOUR MUSKETURTLES
TURTLES, TURTLES EVERYWHERE
COWABUNGA, SHREDHEAD
INVASION OF THE TURTLE SNATCHERS
CAMERA BUGGED
GREEN WITH JEALOUSY
RETURN OF THE FLY
CASEY JONES: OUTLAW HERO
MUTAGEN MONSTER

I recomant this to any TMNT fan, or just any cartoon fan. You won't be sorry buying this DVD. I already can't wait for Volume 5, or Volume 6 for that matter :=)",1144108800,7,1040,4.740331491712707
2521194,5,B000EHSVG4,"The original classic mutant-teens are back, the new series is great, but it's great to see these ""still very watchable"" toons, My 4 and 8 year-old (DAUGHTERS!) enjoy and ask to see these as a companion to the 21st cen. Counterparts. The FOX series just hit 100 episodes, combined with the original 193, TMNTs will be at 300+ before the end of the year. CONGRATs boys!

Don't be fooled by the VOLUME ""4"" This volume is continuing  (not yet completing) the 35 episode season THREE, running September of 1989 to July 1990, their last season as a strictly syndicated series  before CBS, picked them up for the remainder of their 10 years on air. The THIRD vol. contained the first 12 episodes of that season, VOL. 4 contains the next 12.

 Notable stories from this season containing the introductions of two major characters recognizable from the 2000s: CASEY JONES (episode 39) and LEATHERHEAD (episode 41). In these earlier incarnations these character's are less like their FOX or their Mirage comicbook selves, but are still a pleasure to watch. Unfortunately this volume just missed including USAGI YOJIMBO (episode 43)

Here's the running order:

The Old Switcheroo

Attack of the Big MACC

Camera Bugged

The Four Musketurtles

Turtles at the Earth's Core

Beware the Lotus

Take Me to Your Leader

Blast from the Past

Casey Jones - Outlaw Hero

Turtles, Turtles Everywhere

 Leatherhead: Terror of the Swamp

Corporate Raiders from Dimension X

Unfortunately, my tapes got destroyed and I haven't been able to find this on Netflix, Hulu, anything, so I was beyond overjoyed when I found out they had been released on DVD. This show was great. When I heard they were being put back on TV, I was excited, only to find out it was nothing like the original and they had no eyes!!! The new one now isn't too bad but nothing like the original.

2521290,5,B000EHSVG4,"For reason instead of releasing TMNT Season 3 in one complete set, LionGates released it in four volumes (3-6). Probably because there were 47 episodes that aired during the 1989 season.

20,000 Leaks Under the Sea
Take Me to Your Leader
Four Musketurtles
Turtles, Turtles Everywhere

While this is the first season I'm confused is that if the European Vacation episodes were amongst this season why are they not included in this season set of the show?  This season set contains 40 episodes of the original series, which is by far more than what they were able to do with just the volume sets that they were doing prior to this release of the show.  Only if they would've took the time to re-release the first three seasons in sets instead of leaving them in volumes like they are.  With this season set they were able to get a couple bonus stuff into the set unlike what they were able to do with trying to do those one disc sets.  Also a couple episodes missing from this set that makes this set a little hard to get while at the same time get it for the episodes.  Overall with this being a better release than what was given before, I give this set 3.5 star out of 5.",1279756800,,991,4.189473684210526

While this is still the same as the previous volumes have been, though that doing things this way it's taking a while to get all the episodes out on DVD in their seasons that they aired in.  While I can't say that anything new was done with this set cause once again the episodes are on one DVD, and the each of the episodes I feel that they haven't been properly restored up to this point of this volume being released.  Normally when handling old animated shows you there have been companies that handled them properly and managed to restore them to their original way of viewing them.

brand new.

I'm really getting fed up of if receiving packages that are not wrapped up in bubble wrap

in using Amazon for future purchases.

I was worried about the violence for someone so young and was looking for an alternative.  I think this fits the bill.  There are bad guys and heroes.

Counting the ten episodes that come before these, ""All Hallow's Thieves"" and ""The Ninja Tribunal"" this set is missing twelve episodes all together.

This  volume has a decent amount it has abnout 12 of the 35 episode or 34.2% of this season one it which consider what you got on volumes of other show like Sailor moon is decent amount of footage to watch if it is priced right. Some episode like two Leather head ones (original the newer one episodes Leather Head Terroor of the Swamp and Leatherhead meets the rat king weren't on here but you can get them one idividual vhs or on the complete season box set if one exist. (FYI this is before leather head some of the other characters that appeared in the newer series swithched sides origions and nationaalities Baxter stockman was original white but in the newer series he's African american.  This series I my opion is some what better than the newer series due to its more kid friendly villans and content.  If you wanted to collect the episode gradually this might be a good way to start of if you think the selling price is sufficent..  However if you want all the episode at once it might be more realstic you buy the completion season book sets depending on how bad you want them and how much your will to spend.

The episodes are very good quality and it was nice to be able to watch the old show again after all these years and relive it. Yet I was kind of disappointed in how the DVD set was.

2521324,5,B000EHSVG4,"I was so incredibly excited when my Season 4 boxset arrived! This was my favorite show in the 80's. These are some of my favourite episodes and I loved watching the special features with James Avery and Pat Fraley. Shredder and his live-in ""wife"" Krang really made the show for me and hearing the two actors talk about their characters was really cool. This is a must have for fans of the original cartoon. I am looking forward to the rest of the seasons!",1177286400,,455,4.428571428571429
2521325,5,B000EHSVG4,"Season 4 has the best episodes of the series. The last batch of syndicated episodes were the best and the first batch of saturday morning episodes. This boxset has both. Watching the special features was enjoyable too, especially Pat Fraley, the voice of Krang. I got a laugh out of how he came up with Krangs voice. Looking forward to Season 5.",1176336000,2,345,4.580645161290323
2521326,5,B000EHSVG4,To get all of season four in one boxed is totally awesome!  This has to be one of my favorite cartoons of all time.  Every episode is a masterpiece and it is nice to have the special features as well.  Hats off to Lionsgate for releasing season four in full.  The turtles are hot again coming off of an awesome movie and the re releasing of the original cartoons.  Long live the turtles!!!!!,1176336000,2,391,4.301369863013699
2521327,5,B000EHSVG4,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Volume 4 has some great stuff on it. Baxter Stockman comes back (along with the Rat King), Casey Jones is introduced (sounding like a breathy Clint Eastwood), Shredder thinks that he's Michelangelo when a duplicating experiment goes wrong, an alien tourist almost almost sucks up all of New York with his camera, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Leonardo are given a love potion and fall in love with Irma, while Rocksteady falls in love with April, and Shredder and Krang flood the city and send a giant squid after the turtles.

Every episode on this volume is classic. The one drawback to this collection is that on a few episodes some of the characters have different voices. Most notable are Donatello and Krang, who get terrible replacement voices for a few episodes.

But overall, these episodes will really remind you why this show was such a hit in the late 80s-early 90s and why we loved it so much as kids. If you watched this show at all, these episodes will bring it all back. There's plenty of cheesy jokes and ridiculous action.

And if you're looking for (not so) sneaky subversion, in one episode after Shredder throws a smoke bomb, Michelangelo looks right at the camera and quips ""Dude. I hate it when people smoke and run."" That's the stuff that makes children's cartoons into classics!",1172016000,,1329,4.794759825327511
2521328,5,B000EHSVG4,"On September 8, 1990, the show began its first run on CBS.  This was the fourth season of the wildly popular ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" animated cartoon.  The first three seasons had been (and continued to be) shown in syndication on the USA network, and also (for a short while, anyway) on the FOX network.  When the cartoon began airing on CBS, it aired two episodes back-to-back, with ""Turtle Tips"" in between, animated shorts advising viewers young and old on environmental issues, such as not running too much water or wasting too much electricity.

Season Four of the series took the show to new heights, as new characters were introduced, familiar characters were given increased depth, and our Heroes in a Halfshell continued to sky-rocket in popularity.  From 1989-1992, the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" was one of the hottest cartoons on the planet, airing on Saturday mornings after a full hour of ""Garfield and Friends,"" another terrific cartoon based on the comics of Jim Davis.

For me personally, Seasons Three and Four of this wonderful cartoon are my favorite.  For them to finally -- FINALLY! -- be released on DVD has been a long time coming.  And I could not be more thrilled that Season Four in its entirety is going to be released in one fell swoop, instead of being churned out disk by disk every spring and fall.  Any seasons released after this, in my opinion, will just be icing on the cake.  All I've wanted since the invention of DVD was to have Seasons Three and Four make it to this format, and it FINALLY HAPPENED!

I don't know if the ""Turtle Tips"" will ever see the light of day as far as bonus features go.  There were only about ten of them, if I remember correctly, and they just kept getting recycled through all the seasons that aired on CBS.

I know a lot of people like the darker, grittier versions of the Turtles, but I much prefer the goofier, kid-friendly versions that this cartoon consists of.  Season Four, especially, really emphasizes this fact, as some of the funniest episodes in the series are included.  All of the principle characters have their moments to shine comedically, but Shredder and Krang, in particular, have some really funny moments all throughout this season, something that was sorely lacking when the show changed tone dramatically in its waning years.

March 13, 2007, cannot get here fast enough.  I can't wait to see all my old friends again: Donatello, Leonardo, Michaelangelo, Raphael, and Splinter.  I'm even anxious to see Shredder bicker with his live-in wife, alien warlord Krang, and his two bumbling mutants, Bebop and Rocksteady.",1167868800,46,2617,4.829596412556054
2521329,5,B000EHSVG4,"There isn't really much i can add that hasn't been said already. Extras would be cool, yet without them, they keep the price extremly low. Usually a series on DVD with extras would cost as much as 2 DVDs without extras. I personally would pefer 2 DVDs instead of 1 with extras, so i am thankfull the ninja turtles DVDs are cheap.

I don't know why some reviewers state the show is ""still very-watchable"", i disagree, i think the show is brilliant and each episode is more times than not a gem. Im 25 and i watched the Turtles at the peak when they first came out, i still find them very entertaining and this volume continues the trend. ""Leatherhead: Terror of the Swamp"" & ""Casey Jones - Outlaw Hero"" are very good episodes and are terrific charaters that appear in later episodes.

Volume 4 hasn't got THE best set of episodes, yet while it has some very ordinary eps it also has some great ones. You are still going to be very happy with this purchase.",1163808000,,955,4.389830508474576
2521330,5,B000EHSVG4,"I just got this last week, and watched it, and I loved it.  I finally got to understand everything instead of this show and then this show every Saturday morning.  I loved it, I felt bad for Don at the end, and I was really crying feeling how the guys felt, and happy and glad that he made it.

So now I have to just get the rest of the shows that I need for my collection.",1161216000,,373,3.8181818181818183
2521331,5,B000EHSVG4,"Though billed as a ""season 4"" set, these 2-discs only contain 14 of the 26 episodes produced for season 4. If you check various dvd listings, you'll realize that these are the 14 episodes that have not been included on dvd. If you want the other episodes of season 4, you'll have to get the single discs. Sneaky, huh?

Whatever. There are lots of great things about this set. First of all it's FOURTEEN episodes for the same price you've been paying for all the other discs. So it's more than double the ""Hun on the Run"" disc, and 4x some of the early releases. Maybe 4Kids is being generous...or maybe it's just burning off the ""old"" episodes as the series makes the leap to the Fast Forward revamp. Your call.

Second, these are the better episodes from season 4. The first half of the season was kinda hit-and-miss, but the latter half picked things up with a new intro sequence, Karai becoming the new Shredder, a mutant outbreak caused by Bishop, and Don's mutation. Nobody, Usagi Yojimbo, and Gen guest star, the Uncle Augie mystery is solved, and Savanti Romero returns for revenge. There's also a heartbreaking tale from Master Yoshi's early years.

Third, we get the banned episode ""Insane in the Membrane."" This one explains what happened to Baxter Stockman, as well as the introduction of the new Battle Shell seen in the intro. It's a little stronger medicine than the usual fare perhaps, but nothing worth being banned for. Again, your call.

The only thing missing is the season finale ""Ninja Tribunal,"" which has probably been saved for the direct-to-video Ninja Tribunal storyline coming in 2007. Regardless, this is a must-buy for Turtles fans. A great value, and great entertainment.",1158105600,28,1701,4.795221843003413
2521332,5,B000EHSVG4,"So looks like the guys at Funi are going to release 14 episodes from season four in a two dvd special edition.  Looks like we get the following, and if you don't believe me, go to the Tmnt website for hard evidence.  Here's what to expect acording to the press release from Funi.

  Episodes include Still Nobody, The ancient One, Cyon of the Shredder, Prodigal Son, Outbreak, Trouble with Augie, Tale of Master Yoshi, Return of Savanti parts 1 and 2, Adventures in Turtle-sitting, Good Geens parts 1 and 2, and as for that 14th episode, could be Ninja Tribunal or Insane in the Membrane.  Maybe they'll go ahead with Insane, and just include the Tribunal episode in its own 14 episode release, if this one sells good, that is.  I don't see why they couldn't up the ep content to 15 and just go ahead and give us both.  But check the tmnt website for that press release if you're interested.  And looks like the price is pretty low too.  An excelent buy.  But your guess on that 14th ep is as good as mine, folks.  Maybe as the sept 12 release date draws nearer, someone can confirm the last episode we're getting.  Oh and I forgot Samurai Tourists.

  Maybe they'll go ahead and give us Insane in the Membrane because it fits better in the story arc from season four.  And hopefully, we'll get Ninja Tribunal plus the 13 episodes that complete that arc at a later date.  Maybe by Christmas?  I hope so, anyway.

  And do I really need to give a plot synopsis of the latter part of season four?  Well, I think I will anyway.  But if you're lookin for spoilers, you won't find them here.

  Leonardo is still filled with anger due to his defeat at the hands of Shredder and Karai last season.  And after a few adventures in which he nearly loses control, Splinter sends him to Japan to find himself with the help of Yoshi's old master, the ancient one.  But while Leo is gone, a new Shredder suddenly attacks the turtles, and Leo must return home and do battle with this new foe.  Well, maybe not a new foe, but a foe with an attitude ajustment though.

  Also in this portion of the season, slime from agent Bishop's alien creations which has seaped down into the sewers(see Aliens among us from Vol. 3.7: Hun on the Run) has mutated several animals near the turtles' home.  Its up to them to end this outbreak, but one of them is infected by one of the creatures, causing him to experience a second mutation into a mindless beast.  Now the turtles must make a deal with the devil, so to speak, in order to have their brother restored.  Agent Bishop SAYS he has a cure.  But in order for Bishop to administer it, our heros must steal a valuable object for him.  They must invade the stronghold of the new Shredder and steal the Heart of Tengu, but there are darker forces at work here.  Even Bishop doesn't comprehend the evil that will soon be unleashed upon the world.

  So save up your cash and get ready for this interesting dvd release in September!",1155686400,5,2955,4.3863216266173755
2521333,4,B000EHSVG4,"I definately enjoyed this DVD, but it helps when you grew up watching it. This is not the best set of episodes in the series by any means. The first season had the best five episodes by far, but the episodes do get better after this lull. The next volume will get better (I think they got new writers) and from then on it's smoothe sailing until about season 8 or so when they get rid of shredder and the you know what hits the fan.

There were some bad sound tracks on this DVD notably Krangs voice in Green with Jealousy. And it doesn't have any special features either.

Personally I loved this DVD and have every intention on buying every volume to come, but that's cause I'm a hardcore fan. I don't need special features. I just need more episodes and an affordable price.

If you liked the turtles but you weren't a huge fan, then buy Volume 1 and wait to buy volumes 5+.",1154304000,,877,4.2395209580838324
