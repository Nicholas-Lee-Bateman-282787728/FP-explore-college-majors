Hooked on Phonics can be expensive, and these are really great deals.  Worth it for your kids!",1174348800,7,260,4.468085106382978
203405,2,1933863633,"I bought these DVD's for my 2 year old son, who is obsessed with learning.  Letters, colors, numbers, objects, you name it, he loves it.  I thought these DVD's would be perfect, especially after reading the reviews.  I was really disappointed, and my son hated them.  There is a mix of animated characters and real children, and the video quality isn't the best.  I couldn't return the DVD's since we had already opened and watched them, but for the same price I got him&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LeapFrog-Learning-DVD-Set/dp/B002LYD2M6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LeapFrog: Learning DVD Set</a>&nbsp;which he absolutely loves.  He will watch the Leapfrog movies over and over again and sing along with the songs. I would highly recommend those over this Hooked on Phonics set.",1304035200,4,825,5.833333333333333
203406,1,1933863633,This product had nothing to do with phonics whatsoever.  It was not an aide to helping my granddaughter learn how to read.  It was a big disappointment.,1293840000,2,152,4.592592592592593

203408,4,1933863633,My son loves these videos!  He's had them for over a year or so (he is 4.5).  He really enjoys them now that he is in preschool and is excited about learning!  He especially loves the Fun In Motion video.  His name is Aaron like the narrating character...that gives it an extra special appeal for him!,1261785600,,301,4.321428571428571
203409,3,1933863633,"What one would want to know before buying this product? Hooked on Phonics is the the brand name in this case not what the product is for. Hooked on Phonics is a brand name that teaches all different classroom subjects and skills like math, sign language, spanish, study skills, and so forth. This set is a Pre-K prep to give your toddler a head start on some kindergarten skills not one of the company's sets that teaches actual phonics (letters and the accurate sounds they each make). If you want phonics you need to choose another Hooked for Phonics product or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Leap-Frog-Letter-Factory/dp/B0000INU6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Leap Frog - Letter Factory</a>.",1224028800,58,736,5.824074074074074

203414,3,1933863633,"I was very disappointed.  I have a 4 1/2 year old grandson. The set was not what I expected. When I read the title I assumed the DVD was about letters and sounds, That is what phonics means to me. This set is great for a three year old, not for a child who is learning letter sounds.",1178928000,27,283,3.8793103448275863

7801818,5,1933863633,This collection is great my son loves it and he is learning a lot and for those who has something negative to say about the collection is simply because they did not do their research. It clearly stated what the Dvds were about in the description so don't be disappointed and try to bash the company for you carelessness.,1357257600,,321,4.4576271186440675
7801819,2,1933863633,"I was too quick to click buy when I saw ""Hooked on Phonics."" My 4 and 6 yr old are bored to tears by this. It's very simplistic, both in the style, music, stories and visually. So far we've only tried the animal disk and each segment is so short, most with NO VALUE for a child who can already identify animals. Like the segment where a bunny hops around feeding various farm animals, the only time words are said is to identify each animal. No words show up on screen in that segment at all. THERE IS NO PHONIC LEARNING AT ALL. The children photographed on the DVD cases look to be 5-7 yr old, which is very misleading. I think this would serve the same age group as the Baby Einstein videos. Only when my boys were that age I liked the Baby Einstein videos a lot more than what I've seen of this set. I'm sorry I bought this. I gave it two stars (instead of one) because it was my mistake for not researching it more, but compared to Baby Einsteins this is a joke.",1353974400,,966,4.116402116402116
