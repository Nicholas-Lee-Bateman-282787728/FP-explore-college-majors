8492356,5,B00641V3AU,Probably one of my favorite Chet Baker performances :-)  Video quality was better on the laserdisc copy of this concert but this one is readily available :-)  Audio quality is identical for both versions,1422316800,,203,4.9411764705882355
8492357,5,B00641V3AU,We have most of Chet's DVD's and this was one of the best.,1409011200,,58,3.5384615384615383
8492358,3,B00641V3AU,"TERRIBLE video eve though the concert was in 1987 - looks like someone tried to record the concert w/ a cheap cell phone.  Audio is okay.  The tracks are the same as the CD version of this concert. Even with the bad video, it's interesting to watch C.B. in action (I guess bad video is better than no video).  Really only for true C.B. fans (like me),  If you're not a big fan, save your $!",1407369600,,390,4.092105263157895
8492359,5,B00641V3AU,"I received this DVD as part of a package when I bought a subscription to Progression Magazine on the Cruise to the Edge. Hell -- I would have paid that money for this DVD alone! Amazing prog. Sometimes we lose sight of the outstanding prog bands outside of the UK, USA, Poland, and Sweden -- where most of the best-known bands seem to hail from. Listen to Asturias from Japan, or these guys from Australia, and you will see musicianship as good or even better than the well-known ones. Most prog bands by necessity have day jobs, work schedules etc., so touring to other continents is logistically and financially difficult for them. And when they do, it is for the love of the music, of performing, and for their fans -- because the tours are almost certain money losers. I give these guys so much credit for doing this tour and creating this fine DVD. This is a large band. In addition to the standard prog set-up of keyboards, guitar, bass, lead singer, and drums, Unitopia has a second percussionist/xylophone player and a sax/flute player. Both are outstanding, by the way. The music is beautiful throughout the DVD. Each band member gets numerous solo opportunities, and makes the most of them. Unitopia's style combines symphonic prog and fusion and classical synergistically into a captivating mix. There are many passages that truly soar, which is a critical element for my enjoyment of most any music. These are the kind of passages that make you want to jump with unbridled joy. The band plays with considerable energy and verve. The lead singer has a singular style. I think it's really cool. He doesn't move around much but the guy is entirely riveting. I absolutely love this DVD and plan to enhtusiastically start delving into Unitopia's full CD catalog.",1368489600,5,1769,4.784313725490196
8492360,5,B00641V3AU,"I love Jazz.  I consider the live format to be best because improvisation is all about being spontaneous thus is the art.  Chet Baker does not dissappoint in this DVD.  If you know one thing about Baker, is that he lived a hard and sad life that ended tragically.  When observing this concert, particularly during the close-up views, his life hardships are very evident in his face.  However, once he is on his horn, you understand instantly why he is considered one of the greats from the Cool Jazz era which is a very limited group that includes Miles Davis; Gil Evans; Dave Brubeck; John Coltrane.

The music is nothing short of expert classical cool jazz and the improvisation from each of the musicians in the set demonstrate that all are at the very top of their game during this concert.  I've always considered Baker's singing something of a curiosity because there is no doubt that his trumpet playing is distinct and artistic, however, I cannot determine whether he is a good singer but the music doesn't work nearly as well without his vocals.  This is what makes the concert fabulously strange.  When he is playing trumpet you want more, and when he is singing, you anxiously wait and anticipate the trumpet solo which as a combination makes a great build-up and performance format.

The only only negative to this DVD is the recording quality which is below par to say the least, but acceptable.  Considering the age of the recording date I guess this is the best that could be done with the technology.

This is adult music and a performance that only a mature audiance can appreciate.  There are no dancers, gimmicks, lights or synthesizer enhancements.  I get the impression in watching this DVD that if the audience were not there, these guys would be in the basement or garage of their homes doing this anyway.  It's just a bunch of guys sitting down doing their technical trade and they just happen to be in front of a paying audience.  Absolutely incredible performance and a must have for a cool jazz collection.",1364428800,3,2033,4.700564971751413
8492361,5,B00641V3AU,"Good image, good sound, amazing band, poor production.  The band needs to work on a good live show.  They are amazing Musicians but very boring to look at.",1364083200,,155,4.5
8492362,5,B00641V3AU,"This was a GREAT purchase. The tunes are wonderful, the band is swingin' and Chet is in fine form.  The performance of MY FUNNY VALENTINE is the absolute best version I have EVER heard. Each track is a delight but the DVD is worth the money just to hear that rendition of ""...VALENTINE"".. Amazing. It gave me chills. I can't get enough.",1317772800,5,336,4.419354838709677
