2780861,3,B000NTPG7A,Very contrived story about the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Movie suffers from lack of originality-you will already know how each scene will play out.,1183680000,3,175,5.518518518518518
2780862,5,B000NTPG7A,"Growing up, my father rarely talked of his internment camp experiences in Poston, AZ, so we knew very little.  After taking him to see the showing of American Pastime, I was moved by how much he opened up and began sharing some of his feelings and memories.  The movie is realistic, showing the barracks and living conditions of the internees, the family frustrations and their ""shikata ga nai"" attitude of making the best of a bad situation.",1183075200,11,442,4.7272727272727275
2780863,4,B000NTPG7A,"I guess that was my question when I first read the press release on this entertaining little film about life in the World War II Japanese ""relocation camps"" in Utah. Well, I can't really say they do but the film is still worth recommending, if only because it does a good job of telling the little covered story of life in these ""camps"", which herded everybody of Japanese decent (even a Blck Hawaiian!) into what were virtually upscale concentration camps. These people, many of who were born as American citizens were treated like foreigners because of the color of their skin and their heritage.

But back to the film. It revolves around one young man who was destined for college on a scholarship on ""the day that will live in infamy"" - December 7, 1941. We learn that he loved jazz and he shares is love by playing records for his friends and playing saxophone for himself. He also loves baseball, as - until the war - there were many Japanese baseball players.

In the camp he meets a local (non-Japanese) girl (the daughter of one of the town's bigots - an all too contrived plot device) and she plays piano. They meet through playing together. But just about then jazz - and music in general disappears completely from the screenplay! Now it's about baseball and the ""big game"" between the Japanese players and the bigoted ""townies"". I won't give more of the plot away except to say that I was disappointed to see the jazz thread not continue.

Because there are so few films about this period in time -  ""Come See The Paradise"" is the only other one I know of - this is an important film to see. The ""Making of"" bonus feature (about 25 minutes long) repeats lots of the scenes but also - a bit too briefly - interviews survivors of these camps.).

Definitely worth at least a rental.

It should be required watching for any person who claims to be an ""American.""  In the many presentations and films depicting World War II and Pearl Harbor I have ever seen one that was dedicated to the terrible error in judgement America made concerning our Japanese-American brothers and sisters.  From early in 1942 we detained and imprisoned tens of thousands of our Japanese-American citizens and friends solely because of their Japanese heritage. When FDR signed Executive Order 9066 he, his administration and the citizens of this country put a blot on the American landscape that has been well hidden throughout the ensuing years and is one of its most disgraceful. The last camp finally closed its doors in March of 1946...well after WW II was ended!  Here, for the first time and in living color we see only a portion of what occurred during those years and we see it through the eyes of the most American of pastimes...the game of Baseball!

There are several great movies that conical the lives of what happened to the American Japanese people.  There lives were turned upside town,  and gathered up and taken to what was called Internment Camps,  barbed wire fences,  Guard Towers,  and cramp style living in poorly constructed pre-fab buildings.....  Many of the Camps had around 10,000  souls behind barbed wire.  This movie is one of the many good efforts to bring to light how life was in the crampt Internment Camps.  Not all attendees were American Citizens,  many of the parents of the children were Japanese Nationals,  because at that time period,  a Japanese National wasn't aloud to become an American Citizen.
,  but honored the lifestyle and American ways of life,  yet still,  there were some that wouldn't conform especially after they were treated like prisoners...

There is probably truth in it, in essense.  I am sure some of the Japanese who were put in the WW2 camps did what the father does in this movie, that is, try to make the best of it and make life as normal and pleasant as possible under the circumstances.

I especially enjoyed the scene where he (the baseball pitcher/jazz sax player) is teaching her (the mean guard's church pianist daughter) to play with a Jazz feeling, as I composed the song they are playing, and recorded the piano tracks when she is playing the piano.

2780948,4,B000NTPG7A,"This is a great movie.  However, as one reviewer noted, there is some language that is inappropriate for younger audiences.  I wanted to show it to my middle school literature class (after we read an autobiographical novel about Topaz), but found that it was too difficult to get around the language. If there had only been one or two things, I could have gotten away with it.  But there was quite a bit. Here's what it had and where it is:
""son of a bitch"" (about 15 min.)
""bullshit"" (about 18 min.)
""I don't give a damn who wins or loses."" (20 min)
""I've become a God damn babysitter."" (33 min.)
""Please go eat a big pile of shit.""  (34 min.)  This was actually spoken in Japanese and subtitled in English.
""bullshit"" (37 min.)
""Who the hell does he think he is - thinking he cold play baseball"" (38 min.)
""Sit your ass down.""  (1:02 min.)
""I sure as hell ain't doing no haircut.""  (1:36 min.)

It's a shame, because it's a wonderful movie and there's nothing else out there like it.  Again, if there were only one or two instances of this language in the movie (or if ""bullshit"" were the strongest thing), it would not be that much of a problem.  But this occurs so frequently that it just didn't work with a class of 6th through 8th graders.",1350432000,7,1245,4.35064935064935

2780950,3,B000NTPG7A,"I liked the movie on and off. Various scenes were missing transitions--just did not flow well. In some ways, I think the movie bypassed quite a few aspects of harsh reality of the camps. I am no expert, just certain things did not add up, since I know people who grew up the those camps and their parents lost everything. However, I must give credit to the producer for showing the intolerance rampant in them American society and the scale of ignorance among common Americans; in the light of today's global events, movies like these could actually help regular people to avoid snap judgment and bigotry in a communal setting. I had to give the movie three stars for its technical limitations as a finished product. The actor who played the younger son did superb job, and same could be said about several others. But, weak scripts can kill a movie easily. That ""Almost"" happened with this movie. I recommend you pass.",1335571200,,919,4.679012345679013
2780961,5,B000NTPG7A,"`American Pastime` revives a sorrowful chapter in American history: the ignoble internment of Japanese-Americans during the Second World War.  After Pearl Harbor, Japanese-Americans were wrongly vilified as potential traitors, stripped of their civil rights and hoarded into concentration camps throughout the western United States.  Such a shameful episode in our past finally receives worthy treatment in Desmond Nakano`s well-crafted film.  Rather than show the indignities faced by Japanese-Americans in a documentary form, `American Pastime` concentrates instead on the dynamics of an average family caught up in the post-Pearl Harbor paranoia that gave rise to such camps.

The film follows the misfortunes of the Nomura family, a solidly middle class family from East Los Angeles.  One minute, the family is celebrating with neighbors, the next, they are having to abandon their homes, soon to be shuttled off to eastern Utah.  The couple`s two sons are as American as can be, listening to Big Band jazz and playing baseball.

The film does a remarkable and subtle job of portraying the hardships faced by the Nisei in their new `homes,` the `assignment process,` the guard towers with machine guns, the barbed wire, the constant invasion of privacy and the draconian measures dealt those who resisted in any way.  Yet, Japanese-Americans neither complained nor protested the awful machinations and deprivations mandated by their government.

The father, Kaz (well-played by Japanese actor, Masatoshi Nakamura), is the prime exemplar of such an attitude.  He neither questions the legitimacy of why he is where he is nor protests against it.  Instead, he stoically accepts the situation and determines to make the best of it.  He organizes the internees to improve their barracks, set up schools, and hold dances.  Eventually, he even organizes a camp baseball team.

Kaz hopes to recruit his youngest son, Lyle (Aaron Yoo) for the new team.  A promising jazz musician, Lyle refuses to accept his new surroundings.  Instead, he spends his hours practicing his sax and drinking illegal booze with the camp`s wise-guy philosopher.  Lyle refuses his father`s request and instead, plays his sax at the camp dances.  There he gets closer to the camp`s prim and nave music teacher, Katie Burrell (played by the lovely Sarah Drew), daughter of the camp commander, Captain Burrell (Gary Cole).  The blossoming love between these two unlikely candidates is `Pastimes` saving grace.  Instead of presenting a history lesson, the film shows how outside events test the two young lovers and their families.

The film hits its climax when Lyle is assaulted by one of the local thugs in a nearby town.  After learning his assailant plays for the town team, Lyle offers to help the camp team in their exhibition match with the locals.  For Lyle, the game means revenge; for his father, it is a chance to show the locals that the internees are as American as they are.

The seconds tick down to the inevitable showdown and the film makes the most of its little moments.  This is the strength of `American Pastime.` The film shows how the war brought pain and sacrifice to all Americans.  In one such moment, Captain Burrell, denied a ball career by the war, receives news of his son`s death during a game.  Another powerful scene is when the eldest son, Lane, (a sensitive performance by Leonardo Nam) volunteers for the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team (most decorated US military unit ever) and is given an emotion wrought send off by the whole camp.  Yet, when he returns minus a leg, his sacrifices are rendered all the more painful when he is shamefully denied a haircut at the local barber shop.

With the showdown on the diamond, both the Nisei and the locals gain respect for one another.  While the film follows a tried and true plot scheme of young love threatened by disapproving parents, it manages to engage and convince nonetheless.  With their common bond of music, Lyle and Katie` s love survives.  Through a common love for America`s `pastime,' the locals and the internees finally unite under one flag.  Kudos to director Desmond Nakano for making this unassuming and modest film.  It accomplishes its mission; it educates and entertains at the same time.  Well worth watching.",1310515200,3,4287,5.0844062947067235

American Pastime reveals a portion of what life was like for the Japanese-Americans incarcerated in Relocation Camps. Tasteful in showing the hardships and challenges that faced families living in camps, it was true that for some, baseball and other sports are what saved their sanity. Also accurate is the fact that there were some people from Hawai'i that were sent to Topaz, the prejudice they faced, and the heavy loss of life suffered by the Go For Broke 442nd.

I was one of the extras in this movie and having done a three-year project developing lesson plans on Topaz for the Japanese-American National Museum, I can tell you that the director and producer were careful to remain as true to details as possible. Included in the many extras, were people who were actually incarcerated.

2780967,4,B000NTPG7A,"This film is not without flaw, but to me those flaws do not reduce the significance of the story it tells.  American families under suspicion of being traitors, given ten days to settle their affairs and transported under guard to desolate places to live out much of the War.  The internees struggle to make their living conditions better against the prejudice of some of the locals and their guards.  An interracial love story arises amid all this - both fathers dead set against the relationship, while the mothers are more circumspect.  A classic story.  Baseball becomes the vehicle for understanding (at least for some).

A flaw - Somehow I think that the life story of the Japanese father should have been made a more prominent part of the film.  Other than one conversation about his childhood and how baseball improved his life, we have almost no information about him.  Though I like Gary Cole, I didn't think his character should have a larger role than Masatoshi Nakamura, Lyle's father.  Not a major flaw - As one other commenter has mentioned, two of the actors playing Japanese American roles were not Japanese American.

2781002,4,B000NTPG7A,"""American Pastime"" is a nice film about a period of America's history that most people would like to forget ever happened. The internment of US citizens of Japanese descent was one of the more embarrassing things that the US government has done to its own people and this film tries to capture some of those sentiments. The movie touches on a lot of themes that Japanese-Americans likely felt during this time period and as such, is a nice fictional representation of the era.

One of my complaints however is that I feel like the love story is extraneous and doesn't really help flesh the characters out. There are limited extras but the interviews with some of the people interned during the time period were very good to listen to.",1200096000,2,734,4.689922480620155

2781005,4,B000NTPG7A,"I wonder if the U.S. government would have interred Japanese-Americans during World War II if Pearl Harbor had not happened, or even if the original plan of the Japanese had succeeded and they had formally declared war right before the attack.  If there had not been a sneak attack and therefore no ""day that will live in infamy,"" would that have changed what happened?  Or was paranoia a necessary ingredient for the government to enact such a racist policy?  ""American Pastime"" engenders such questions because virtually all of the film takes place in one of these interment camps.  The title comes from the fact that the climax of the film is a baseball game between a team of Japanese-Americans from the camp and the local semi-pro team.

Lyle Nomura (Aaron Yoo) is so American he plays jazz saxophone.  He also loves baseball and was going to go to college on a baseball scholarship when Pearl Harbor ended that dream.  The Nomura family ends up in the Topaz Relocation Center near Abraham, Utah, and like the rest of the prisoners (they are called that in the film and not detainees) they try to make a new life in the camp.  His brother Lane (Leonardo Nam) gets out of the camp by joining the Army and going off to fight in Europe for the country that has put his family in a camp.  Their father, Kaz (Masatoshi Nakamura), loves baseball as much as he loves America and he sets up a league in the camp.

Top billing in the film goes to Gary Cole as Billy Burrell, a guard at Topaz who is hard hitting catcher for the local semi-pro baseball team (I understand Cole is the ""big name"" in the cast, but he should have gone with an ""and"" credit at the end).  Cole's character is not the ultimate villain in the story; that would be the town's barber, Ed Tully (Jon Gries), who is the unrelenting racist in the film.  But Burrell is the pivotal character because he is the one on the fence about the Japanese-Americans, especially after his son is killed in combat in the South Pacific.  However, that does not appear to weigh as much on his mind as the fact that he almost made it to the Major Leagues.  If Tully is the little devil on Burrell's shoulder there is another guard at the camp who is the angelic counterpart because he is the one who notices that the Japanese-Americans serving in the Army in Europe (such as Lane) are making a name for themselves as soldiers.

There have been other films set in such camps, such as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Come-See-the-Paradise/dp/B000EXDSCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Come See the Paradise</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snow-Falling-on-Cedars/dp/0783240325/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snow Falling on Cedars</a>,"" which have primarily been romances set against the war and life in the camps.  ""American Pastime"" does have a pair of young lovers from opposite sides of the fence (literally), but the romance takes a melodramatic term since Lyle falls for Katie (Sarah Drew), Burrell's daughter.  Their fathers go the Montague-Capulet route on the subject, to the displeasure of their offspring and spouses, but the romance becomes a secondary consideration big game (even thought the two families actually manage to run into each other off the field DURING the game).  The game itself is okay; as soon as you see who gets to be home team for this friendly little encounter a baseball fan should be able to figure out how this is going to play out.  However, the movie does manage to come up with a way of making the final play of the game resolve a lot of the film's major issues.

I watched this 2007 movie after catching Ken Burns' documentary on PBS about ""The War,"" where the story of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team was a major thread, so it was interesting to know what the charcters are talking about in this movie regarding the high casualties the unit took effecting the rescue of the ""Lost Battalion"" in the Vosges Mountains of France in October 1944. But such things are just a reminder that there is a much larger story out there about what happened to Japanese-Americans during World War II than what this movie can show us.  The term ""concentration camp"" dates back to camp used by the British in South Africa during the Second Boer War.  My understanding is that during World War II the relocation centers where 100,000 American citizens of Japanese decent were sent during World War II were called concentration camps at the time.  Of course, after the war the term became identified with the death camps run by the Nazis in Europe, but when I watch a movie like ""American Pastime"" that reminds us of what we did to our own citizens, I cannot help but think of places like Topaz as concentration camps on American soil.",1192233600,29,4783,4.848894348894349
2781006,5,B000NTPG7A,This is a wonderful movie. During the two hours of watching it you'll be enthralled by the characterization. It's inclined to accept tolerance of different people and bridges East and West.,1190073600,3,189,5.129032258064516
2781007,5,B000NTPG7A,This is a wonderful film on so many levels.  There are so many layers to the lives of the characters in this film.  It is worth watching.,1188950400,4,137,4.037037037037037
2781008,1,B000NTPG7A,"I was initially dumbfounded by scenes of the actual camp layout -- high security fencing topped with angled brackets of barbed wire surrounding the entire camp; a gate not unlike those that were at POW concentration camps; the utter barrenness of the desert location, void of any farmland; the ubiquitous presence of soldiers in their towers with machine guns and search lights harassing the residents.

These Topaz scenes are without historical foundation -- they are Hollywood exaggerations aimed at creating the worst possible of conditions at the relocation centers to effect in viewers awe, shock, and a sense of pity and shame for such ""horrible"" treatment. The Director should have gone all the way and thrown in some large shower rooms with doors that could be bolted shut from the outside, rows of furnaces, a mass burial pit, or a scene of some ""prisoners,"" as the movie fondly labels the residents, being lined up against the fence and shot. If they wished to make these centers truly concentration camps, they should have been more consistent at least. A simple check online of photos of the Topaz Center and surrounding farm fields, however, will be enough to convince one of the movie's extreme fiction element.

Historically misinformed episodes throughout the movie detract immensely from the story it wishes to tell. Undeniably it is a moving story. However, it is all occurring at the wrong place. A better location would have been a mid-western city where Japanese Americans (permanent or resettled) tried to carry on normal lives and were discriminated against by the locals, and yet, in the midst of the turmoil, there was love and romance and the mutual love of baseball, which is what the movie really is all about. What a much more enjoyable movie it would have been had it stayed away from the relocation center issues, about which those connected with the movie sadly seemed to have exhibited their lack of historically accurate information. And need I even mention the Chinese actors and actresses?

In promotions of this film are found some very erroneous statements:

1. ""120,000 Japanese Americans, though citizens of this country...""

This is a most-obvious error -- 120,000 is not the correct number, they were not all Japanese Americans, and they were definitely not all citizens of the United States.

2. ""...uprooted from their homes... forcibly relocated...""

Most, if not all, left willingly, taking care of matters prior to leaving their homes. They were not torn from their homes, as ""uprooted"" insinuates, nor forced from their homes. It is not fair to those who did NOT pull up roots, but evacuated temporarily, and later returned to their homes, farms, and businesses. It is also unfair to the tens of thousands of Nikkei who were never evacuated because they weren't in the four states affected. ""Evacuated"" is the proper term that should be used.

3. ""...camp residents are imprisoned behind wire fences and overseen by armed guards.""

In real center life they were NOT imprisoned. Prisons were different; they were not the relocation centers. Some of the residents THOUGHT they were in prison; each resident has a different view, a different story to tell. There is clearly an ulterior motive behind promoting the idea of imprisonment and incarceration at the relocation centers.

They were not overseen by any such guards in real life at the centers. They were overseen by their fellow Nikkei administrators. They were also protected and served by fellow Nikkei police officers in each center. They were also protected and served by Nikkei fire department volunteers. The few military guards at the centers were not there to oversee, but rather to control access and, at times, control riotous troublemakers.

The words at the end of the movie are most suspicious: ""During the entire war, there was not a single incident of espionage or sabotage reported in America involving any person of Japanese descent.""

Why was that even mentioned? Such a statement clearly reveals ulterior motives, that all persons of Japanese ancestry in the United States during WWII were innocent victims. However, not all persons of Japanese ancestry in the United States during WWII were entirely trustworthy and loyal to the United States, e.g. the Tule Lake segregants, and the renunciants who preferred Imperial Japan to the United States.

The story, as I said, is heart-warming, and the goal of the movie is to show that we are all the same -- we have the same love of sports, love of honor, and a desire for human worth. Yet were this film's historical setting based upon factual history, the main plot would probably not at all be what a movie producer would want. The scenes of a mean GI mistreating an innocent Japanese American would be gone. In real center life, games were held all the time between the center teams and local teams, romances were common, and guards were friendly.

There were also many Nikkei who lived outside the centers, who were never involved in any evacuation, simply because they did not live on the West Coast. They lived in peace with their neighbors, contrary to what ""American Pastime"" wishes to portray. Such a movie on these thousands of other Nikkei would be most welcome as it would reveal many interesting social patterns during WWII that are kept secret by those who lived such lives.",1185926400,8,5356,4.983202687569989

I respect that this movie attempts to shine light on such a terrible period in American history...the imprisonment of American citizens during World War II.  In my eye, however, this movie could have been so much more and could have been made as three separate films.

The movie attempts to focus on the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the great fighting squad of Japanese-Americans that fought in the European theater, and a baseball game between an interment camp team and a team from a local town.  While the movie attempts to ""spray to all fields"" by covering each of these three interesting stories, I feel it misses the mark by not paying enough attention to any of them.  I would have liked to have seen this movie turned into much more detailed accounts about American citizens being uprooted from their lives and the racism they faced, the Japanese-American 442nd regiment that fought in World War II, and a history of Japanese American baseball before, during, and after the war.

8181277,5,B000NTPG7A,"American Pastime is probably not a movie that someone would immediately recognize as being representative of the incarceration experience. Its a movie that is targeted at sports fans, but they're in no way the only demographic who can understand and connect with the movie. This focus on baseball explains its original appearance not in a theater, but on ESPN. However, despite the guise of being nothing more than a simple baseball story, the movie tells a grounded, nuanced story. It tells a story that addresses many of the elements of incarceration, through the much more relatable lens of baseball. As Gary Coles character says, This was never about baseball (A. Pastime).
 The film itself begins just how you might expect. The protagonist, Lyle Nomura (played by Aaron Yoo), is surrounded by friends and family, enjoying food, music, and friendship. He enjoys life filled with success. That is, until Pearl Harbor. There is an abrupt explosion, and we see historical footage of the bombing of Pearl Harbor and President Franklin Delano Roosevelts famous speech. It is here that we begin to see what being incarcerated looks like, directly through the eyes of a young man whose dreams of going to college and playing baseball were snatched away from him. We are treated to more historical footage, and soon Lyle finds himself at the entrance of Topaz Relocation Center. It is here that Lyle seems to begin to understand his situation, and the cultural atmosphere that brought his successful family to a random desert in Utah. It is from here that we see the various injustices that plague the camps. Camp guards have no respect for the Japanese Americans, not even down to basic privacy. Most are very openly racist, and for much of his time there, Lyle lies in his bed shell-shocked, wondering what in the world he should do. However, as time passes, he begins to understand his position, and he learns about his new surroundings and how to adapt to them. He meets an old man making liquor out near the fence, and the old man ends up acting as a moral compass and an unlikely source of wisdom throughout the movie. Hes the first person to tell Lyle that he isn't in a free country straight to his face. Hes the first person to tech Lyle that the only way to win at gambling is to be the house. He is also the first to be the voice of reason. When Lyle bets Billy Burrell (played by Gary Cole) ten dollars that he can strike him out. When Burrell cheats and Lyle loses, the old man immediately gives up the money and sternly tells Lyle to let it go (A. Pastime), instantly recognizing the futility of arguing over the lost money. Around the same time, Lyles brother Lane enlists in the army, determined to prove his loyalty, though Lyle believes that his brother will simply get killed and that it will prove nothing. It is at this point that we witness the real-life conflict between those who enlisted and those who resisted joining the US Army given form by the conflict between Lyle and Lane. As Lane goes to war, we see another unique event. Lyle begins a secret romance with Burrells daughter, and that in and of itself reveals peoples capacity to see a person for who they are, beyond race. As the film progresses, the little baseball team that the incarcerates started in the camp is allowed to temporarily leave to play against the local team, the Abraham Bees. The Bees have a few notable players, like Burrell and openly racist barber Ed Tully (played by Jon Gries). Tully appears throughout the movie, roughing up Lyle and refusing to cut Lanes hair when he returned from the war. Upon finding out that Tully is part of the Bees, Lyle begs his Father to allow him to play. After much training, the day finally comes. The Topaz team meets the Bees on their home field, and a fateful game begins. We see straight off the bat that the Bees play rough, and that they have absolutely no respect for their opponents. It is only later though, that we find out what exactly the people from Topaz have bet on their team. $2,500 dollars, for a haircut. It is revealed that the Bees did not have the money to pay off the bet should they lose, and Lyle came up with the idea that Ed Tully must give Lane a haircut if Topaz wins. When someone from Topaz questions this seemingly ridiculous bet, the old man once again steps in and asks Is it really? (A. Pastime). He understood that this is not just a game, but a fight for respect. Getting a haircut from Tully would be a sign of equality and respect for the Japanese people in Topaz. The knowledge that this is what they're playing for energizes the Topaz team and their supporters, and they play on toward a tense finish. It is at this fateful moment that Billy Burrell reveals himself to be a much more principled and insightful man than previously thought. He admitted to dropping the ball as he fell to the ground at the end of the game, giving Topaz the win. The movie closes with a brief bit of history, explaining the scale of incarceration, and the date on which the last camp closed.
 This first half or so of the movie provides insight into the incarceration experience, through events like the initial move to Topaz, the guards barging into the barracks while people were changing, and the guards demeanor help visualize the varied acts of dissent that occurred during the actual incarceration. The initial arrival at Topaz is depicted as dusty, hot, and unfamiliar, with an incredulous quality to the atmosphere. As a matter of fact, the movie was shot close to the historical site of the actual Topaz camp. The way the guards treated people displayed their contempt for the new residents of Topaz, a sentiment which largely existed in the real world. Lyles lost scholarship represents the dreams of many that were crushed by the internment order. Lanes quest to prove himself in the war to the point of coming back with a replacement leg, represents the need to prove loyalty and Americanism that many people felt. Lyles parents wished to be American, yet wished to hold onto their Japanese culture as well. They represented the very real dichotomy between American culture and Japanese culture. The racism displayed by Tully and many others represents the racism and xenophobia that Japanese Americans experienced. Tully also inadvertently reveals his acceptance of the WRAs propaganda, by saying that they (the American People) are providing the Japanese with food, water, shelter, and clothing (A. Pastime), so why not cash as well. Videos that promoted ideas like this were popular among the public at the time, despite the distorted vision of reality that they portrayed. This setting, combined with the actions of the characters, allowed American Pastime to show and represent far more of the incarceration experience than expected.
 Though the movie portrays parts of the incarceration experience, it leaves out or underrepresents key events. Descriptions of the conditions in specific portions of the camp are largely kept aside, with only a few focused images of the desolate landscape. There is no mention of the food or bathroom situations, and only a little glimpse of the residents making their own improvements to the barracks. The room in which the Nomura family lives in from about halfway through the movie onward looks more like a slightly rundown apartment room than an incarceration camp barracks. Lane is shown enlisting in the Army, but draft resistance is never shown nor mentioned. Another major event, the loyalty questionnaires may as well have not existed. Though the lack of inclusion of many of these events hurts the films impact as a historical piece, the stylistic choice to omit said events can be attributed to the nature of the film. American Pastime is a baseball themed historical drama, and it seems that in the interest of keeping the story focused and moving, these events were excluded. That way the movie can use a historical setting while still maintaining its entertainment value.
 The events in the film each lend themselves to a form of dissent. The many things that Lyle did, such as helping make and distribute illicit alcohol, gambling, and competing with the guards, demonstrated one specific method of dissent. More importantly, the baseball game itself represent a way of dissenting against their treatment and the racism they faced.  As Robin Kelley wrote in his piece, We Are Not What We Seem, While the meaning and effectiveness of acts differ according to circumstances, they make a difference, whether they were intended to or not (Kelley 78). Kelley is describing the concept of infrapolitics, generalized as the idea of hidden dissent. The term can be defined either in terms of discretionwhat passes politically unnoticedor of significancewhat does not quite qualify as political. (Marche 3). Kelley mentions that hidden dissent can take many different forms. When faced with racism and disrespect from guards who have a passion for baseball, Lyles goal of beating them at their own game is in fact a form of hidden dissent. On the outside, he simply wants to beat them at baseball, but underneath all that, winning against the guards is a form of resisting their taunts and their racism. Since baseball is a shared passion between the guards and the incarcerates, it has powerful meaning as a form of resistance.
 American Pastime can be described as taking the middle road. It uses the time-period to great effect, setting a nuanced scene that can have many layers. It strongly portrays the fundamental injustice of freedom being stolen from American citizens, yet focuses enough on baseball to be an entertaining drama. Human relationships help to keep the story flowing, setting the tone for each scene.  Ultimately, American Pastime does not break any barriers or tell an incredible story. It doesnt address much of the confusion and misinformation that exists about incarceration, nor does it attempt to. Despite that, it uses the universal medium of baseball to broaden awareness of Japanese incarceration, if not the individual facts. Baseball is a sport we can all understand and relate to. American Pastime successfully connects baseball to an unlikely setting, creating a movie that appeals to many people, people who would be disinterested in a traditional documentary. Relating baseball to the fundamental concepts of respect and freedom creates a powerful message; a message which has the potential to resonate far and wide.

TL;DR: It represents the time period well, and is pretty interesting. Worth watching.",1489104000,,10554,4.875766016713092
8181278,4,B000NTPG7A,"In the sense of being an entertaining film, this movie does a fantastic job of captivating its audience with topics and themes relevant to them while portraying at least some aspect of the Japanese American incarceration. The film itself is quite intriguing and leaves viewers satisfied with a happy ending where the underdogs come out on top. However, from a historical and educational standpoint, this film is lacking in several areas. The biased portrayal of particular details of this historical memory only furthers the uninformed psyche of the general public about the true nature of these camps. The film feeds into the propaganda circulated since the beginning of these camps that life for the Japanese American people would work out in their favor, with little time given to the remembrance of the actual devastation these people underwent.",1489104000,,849,5.204379562043796
8181279,4,B000NTPG7A,"Considering that this movie takes a relatively sensitive topic like the injustices of the Japanese American incarceration and tries to make it more palatable by adding the element of baseball, it is clear that its target audience is not limited to historians and scholars and/or Japanese Americans but rather the general public, specifically sports fans. This does not mean that there is no educational intent, however, as making the film more accessible to a wider and more predominantly Caucasian audience allows the director, who is himself a Japanese American, to showcase the inhospitable camp environment and the suffering of camp residents. Being an entertainment film though does obviously mean that its illustration of the camp experience is very surface-level compared to dedicated documentaries.

The films depiction of the physical conditions at Topaz is commendable as it is quite accurate. Both the exterior and interior of the residential barracks were shown, giving the audience a detailed look at the poorly constructed hovels that camp residents had to make due with, as well as their cramped, military-like living conditions. The venue chosen for constructing the set was also spot on as it captured the empty, dusty wasteland upon which Topaz stood. The director actually had the set built very close to the real-life concentration camp in Delta, Utah for the sake of capturing this important backdrop. Some of the camp facilities were also shown, such as the school where Lyles love interest, Katie, taught music. The interior had a very well established yet improvisational feel to it: the walls were lined with posters, pieces of paper and bulletin boards, yet the children had no desks and sat on folding chairs. The improvised feel of the camps can been seen all over the set, such as when Lyle and Katie share their first intimate conversation after the dance while sitting on some wooden crates. The shabby camp surroundings juxtaposes excellently with the full suit and fedora that Lyle was wearing for the occasion, as well as the opening scene where the Nomura family is in their own home, explicating the drastic change of environment the Nikkei were subjected to.

Though the visual aspects of the camp experience were expertly captured, the emotional aspect as not explored very deeply. Though racism and its effects on individuals is covered in scenes such as Lyles initial batting wager with Billy Burrell and when Kaz and Lane go into town to purchase supplies, most of the screen time spent in the camp is used on various devices, such as the dance party or the playing of baseball, which show that the Nikkei are just as much Americans as their Caucasian counterparts. When reading Yamadas poems, one is really able to internalize the psychological atrocities of incarceration: the despairing tone of the words There must be no light at the end of Curfew is palpable, the mention of the excreta and the blood in In the Outhouse is positively repulsive, just like how it must have been for them. (Yamada, 1976) These types of heavy emotions were a daily occurrence and made camp life much harder than it may appear on the surface, yet in the film the incarcerated Nikkei are shown as living a relatively normal life, just with inconveniences.

American Pastime features not only the social amnesia described by Kashima but also the JACL version of camp history described by Murray. As stated by Kashima (1980): For most internees, a hazukashi or attitude of shame prevailed and that memories of incarceration were a deep consciousness of inferiority, [] evidenced in a shying away from exposure which might subject them to further hurt. This social amnesia is very apparent in the film as there is an obvious lack of emotional suffering being represented other than the indignation of direct, person-to-person racism. Under most circumstances, this could be explained by the fact that there is a need to make the film more upbeat to match the tone of a feel-good sports movie. But the reason for making the film about incarcerated Nikkei is to also remind people of the atrocities brought about by racism within our own country. Given the all too common coping mechanism of whitewashing camp history and the fact that the director is a Japanese American himself, it is likely that this was done to make the film not only more palatable to the general public but to the Nikkei community as well. The JACL version of camp history, as described by Murray, is also very dominant and the JACLers attitude is prevalent amongst almost all the protagonists other than Lyle. When active dissenters are shown asking the just questions of What happened to the constitution? Where are all the Germans? What about the Italians? they are shown wearing Japanese headbandsa sign of fanaticismand are even labeled as bad apples by Nori, the witty and loveable old man. (Nakano, 2007) In addition, the chanting of Go for broke! during the finale scene felt rather out of place and contrived. It felt like an appeasement to those who supported drafting Nikkei, as well as a confirmation that going for broke, joining the 442nd and being overtly patriotic to an extreme is the correct way. In this respect, the film really does [border] on [the] thin edge of propaganda. (Murray, 2008)

In summation, American Pastime is a baseball movie with a Nikkei incarceration theme, and therefore should not be viewed as a fully accurate portrayal of life within Topaz War Relocation Center. Its depiction of camp conditions is skin deep and does not delve into the true multi-faceted nature of the situation or the far reaching emotional ramifications of unjust incarceration. Ultimately, it is meant for an audience that is relatively ignorant of Japanese American history and thus its educational value only reaches as far as providing an introduction to the subject.
