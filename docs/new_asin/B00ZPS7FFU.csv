8720577,4,B00ZPS7FFU,"I search for art documentaries that can be inspiring. I love it when the artist's work can be portrayed in a way that catches your imagination. I also love it when an artist has reached the heights of immortality and their artwork seems to hold some greater meaning. Unfortunately most art documentaries don't capture the spirit of the artist or his work, but there are some special ones out there and I have found this series ""Exhibition on Screen"" to have a few inspiring documentaries. This one on Van Gogh really shows him as one of the great immortal artists, which I found inspiring because I was never that inspired by him before. He comes across as one of those figures from history like a Rembrandt or Caravaggio who lived and died as unappreciated artists in their own time, but rose to be giants when later generations came to see the true magic of their genius. What I found most intriguing was ""the Wheatfield with Crows"" painted shortly before his suicide shows a haunted scene with an ominous country dirt path leading to the unknown.",1472428800,9,1049,4.675675675675675
