7960644,5,B000064911,"I have a large number of workout tapes, and I consider this one to be a favorite.  Gilad begins with a warmup, followed by a few minutes of shoulder, back, and leg exercises using no weights.  The heart of the workout is the aerobics segment, which lasts approximately 25-30 minutes.  I feel that the routine is a very effective fat burner.  You will also work the inner and outer thighs, and there is an intense abdominals workout towards the end.  I use this tape on non-weight training days and would classify it as intermediate level (however beginners and advanced can put less or more into it as needed).  For the most part, I think the music is great since it is performed by a live band which is more interesting to me than the bland generic music heard in most workout videos.  Gilad is an incredibly motivating teacher.  Some of the silly aspects of the workout, such as the camel man and dancing girl, provide comic relief as you sweat.  I personally feel that I have gotten my money's worth plus more with this tape.",1086307200,6,1028,4.513513513513513
7960645,4,B000064911,"This might also be the first exercise tape with a message--the very welcome message of Middle East peace.
He and his crew work out under the suspicious eye of an Arab on a camel--until Gilad runs up and accosts him (in his inimitable manner) by yelling, ""Hey, Camel Man, do you want to join us?"" The camel man does not go that far, but he does a couple of sit-ups on his camel, showing that he at least accepts the aerobicizing Israelis, possibly because they include a group of young girls in bikinis. Peace at last!
So, Four Stars of David for the tape--even if I DO wish that the low- and high-impact sections would be packaged separately, so I don't have to fast-forward the fast part. Could we call this the two-tape solution?

7960646,5,B000064911,"I love to workout to this video.  The time just flies by and I am drenched in sweat by the end of it.  I recommend this video along with Gilad's Get Fit Quick series.  If you're like me and have two left feet, you'll find that Gilad is an athlete and not a dancer, so he keeps the steps simple.  Even a big burly guy would be comfortable with these moves.  I have middle eastern family, so the music, which one reviewer thought annoying, is actually nice to me.  It makes a change from the usual workout music.  Anyway, I have lost four dress sizes in the last year solely from workout videos.  My favorites are Gilad and The Firm.  Include this one in your video rotation and you won't be disappointed in the results.",1029456000,8,718,4.2592592592592595
7960647,4,B000064911,"It's very interesting to exercise to a workout video filmed in an exotic locale, and Jerusalem is no exception, but after the first two segments of this video I was longing for the familiar Bodies in Motion set. Primarily because of the music, which often lacks rhythm and is sometimes too loud. Of course, this is not always the case, but the lead singer's voice is incredibly annoying--it has taken me a long time to get used to it, and I'm generally very open to international music.
The workout itself is not bad (fun intermediate-level aerobics) but the  floor work really lacks variety. During the floor work there are three segments devoted to abs, but only one short segment of leg work, and nothing for the buttocks, although this was mentioned at the beginning of the video. Great if you want to firm up your midsection, but not enough thigh and buttocks toning.
This production is complete with camels, a 'desert man', live band, and a pretty dancer, but it doesn't compare to the classic Bodies in Motion videos.",1020902400,5,1024,4.720670391061453
