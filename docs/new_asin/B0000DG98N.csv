8001001,5,B0000DG98N,"This DVD is great. It takes you back to the year the US had it's second best WC performance (the first was 1930). You see performances of great players like McBride, Reyna, and Donovan. There are some post game interviews, and you get to see the USMNT fans you didn't know existed back then. I decided to follow the USMNT after this WC when they humiliated and eliminated Mexico, the ""CONCACAF Giant"".",1504051200,,401,4.583333333333333
8001002,4,B0000DG98N,"I am a big fan of USA's current squad, and they may prove in the next World Cup they are better. However, I contend that 2002 was our better team. They were a more solid team throughout the lineup although with less stars. Currently, USA has some unrecognized World Class players on the current team, but some notable gaps in talent in front and back with a weaker bench. I enjoyed video who were (MAYBE?) screwed out of an advancement. You decide.

I thought the key was the youthful Donovan and Beasley burning down the sidelines. Together they were almost too much too handle for 90 minutes! This is a pretty good highlight of their performance. I only wish we could see their entire matches with Germany and Portugal.",1331424000,,721,4.589147286821706
8001003,4,B0000DG98N,"I loved this DVD. It reminded me of the way I jumped and cheered at 5 am in my basement during the 02 World Cup. I really wish that they had a DVD like this for our previous World Cup teams, as I am a bit of a collector, and the 94 Cup was so special, really kickstarted US Soccer. The matches are edited, so you are watching actual match footage, not just highlights. I actually cheered everytime the US scored, even 4 years later. Very exciting presentation. A little more in-depth coverage could have been provided as far as pre-match buildup and whatnot, but considering it is th eonly item of its kind out there (that I know of), it's a great DVD.",1153094400,,652,4.266129032258065
8001004,5,B0000DG98N,"The DVD brought back the euphoria of the 2002 USA performance. It could have contained a little more analysis, history, and interviewes, but I still consider it to be a great value.",1112918400,,181,4.6875
8001005,4,B0000DG98N,"The sad thing about being a soccer/football fan in the USA about our national team's fantastic showing in Korea/Japan 2002 was that by the time people in this country actually started to follow the team, the Germans had already broken our hearts and knocked us out.  Such is the fate of a sport most people play but rarely follow due to a B-level professional league in an A-level country.  And the fact that all the games were played in the morning here couldn't've helped matters, either.
Anyway, this 60-minute DVD is a nice keepsake of Team USA's run to the Last 8 of the world's most prestigious sporting event.  It is a bit pricey (only true fans need apply), and for some reason there are no player interviews or other soundbites following the Group Stage games (and no interviews at all of Bruce Arena, the architect of this adventure and a man whose stature rose enough due to its result that none other than the Italian FA was considering his hiring for their own national side...thankfully he's still here, as there is unfinished business at hand).  Hearing the players' and the coaches' reflections upon passing farther in the tourney than any US team since 1930 (the first year the World Cup was contested) would have been a nice addition.
There is plenty of action, though...significant game footage is shown of all the USA's matches (especially the opener with Portugal, one of the best matches of the tournament), naturally all the goals and replays from various angles...and the commentary if from the UK coverage of the event (which saves us from listening to ESPN's), so we get to watch the highlights without listening to too much unnecessary blather.  For the money there should be more; I'd like to think FIFA would have approved a better package for one of the best World Cups ever, but I'm sure their bottom line was the determining factor.  At close to thirty dollars a throw someone's doing pretty well from it.
Followers of USA Soccer and members of ""Sam's Army"" can't do without this one, to be sure...see you in Germany in 2006; we owe Ballack & Co. a little somethin':-)",1089849600,4,2100,4.724043715846994
8001006,5,B0000DG98N,"Whether you stayed up till the wee hours of the morning to watch our first match of the 2002 World Cup against HEAVILY favored Portugal, who at the time were ranked 4th in the world, or not, this DVD is a must for any supporter of real Football. Re-live us going 3 nil up on the Portugeese as Figo and company could do nothing, Clint Mathis' settling then hammering of our first strike that temporarily silenced the partisan Korean crowd, the EXPECTED thrashing of Mexico, (we've been running them ragged since the early 90's), and the heartache of the wrongly disallowed goal we put in against Germany that sent us home, (thanks Hugh Dallas, grrr). There was a match vs. Poland too, aparently...I think, (-; ...it's here as well and it looks like we lost that one??? (The cover of this DVD has Landon  Donovan celebrating a goal against the Poles that was called off-side! Oops).
Arena, Donovan, Reyna, Friedel and company laid the Fluke of '98 to rest, making this DVD worth every cent to Americans who love the beautiful game. Now we have to follow through by qualifying for Germany '06 and doing better than 2002. Come on you boys in white!!!",1068508800,9,1146,4.617647058823529
