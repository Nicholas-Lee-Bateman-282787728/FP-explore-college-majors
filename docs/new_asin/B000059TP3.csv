7934209,4,B000059TP3,"Echoes is a 4-episode TV series produced by UK Channel Four, based on the book of the same title by popular Irish author, Maeve Binchy. The atmosphere of 1950's Ireland is well-conveyed, and while some of the acting is a bit wooden, much of it is of excellent quality.  The extras include a Maeve Binchy Biography, a bibliography, cast filmographies and a picture gallery. Binchy's novel is faithfully portrayed. Enjoyable.",1382400000,,423,5.042857142857143

Claire who has poor parents excels in school under the tutelage of well I forget her name. They form a friendship that lasts over the years. I think her teacher sees a kindred spirit in Claire and vice versa. They both have had troubles in love and they both have come from poor families and are extremely smart. Not fitting into the poor end, yet not fitting into the rich end. Outsiders in a way. I think the teacher's brother has brought her some respectability other than the teaching because he is a priest, yet all is not right here and another side story develops. Clair falls in love with David, who is of the rich side. She gets, well I won't tell, but the ending is different and sort of sad, just the same feeling you kind of get when you hear the rustle of wind in Castlebay, a sort of sorrow or grief, but also a whole lot of breathtaking beauty.

The story is set in the Irish town of CastleBay. Clare O'Brien the grocers daughter dreams of an academic career in Dublin, Gerry the local photographer wants fame and wealth, David Power the doctor's son was t to be a cosultant in Dublin. Angela O'Hara the local teacher who helps Clare to gain scholarships to both secondary school and university , has her own secret, her brother a priest has a japanese wife, and he wants to bring her home to meet the locals! Not quite the thing to do in 1950s Ireland. Clare, Gerry and Davids' lives are linked in way that has tragic consequences, as none of their lives turns out the way they wanted. If you enjoyed the book then this video will not dissappoint.",1040601600,3,765,4.550724637681159
