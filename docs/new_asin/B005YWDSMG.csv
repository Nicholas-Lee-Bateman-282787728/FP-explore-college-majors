8489348,1,B005YWDSMG,"I wanted to like this because I really think Wendy Kennedy has a gift. But this movie was dreadful, boring, no new or real info and would leave a person who hadn't actually seen channellers before wondering what was wrong with these women. I know the producer meant to uplift people, but he really missed the mark on this one.",1356652800,,326,4.45
8489349,5,B005YWDSMG,"This DVD is a treasure for those seeking spiritual growth or just to satisfy their curiosity.
Khashyar's movie is amazing!  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to expend their awareness and seeks information outside the traditional (3D) box. Waiting impatiently for Vols. 2 & 3.",1327881600,,290,5.041666666666667
8489350,5,B005YWDSMG,"I love this so much. Everything they bring is on time, in alignment and so uplifting. Nora and Wendy we so appreciate your work! Thank you!",1326758400,4,139,4.384615384615385
8489351,5,B005YWDSMG,"Wendy Kennedy and Nora Herold deliver easy-to-comprehend brilliance in this truly leading-edge DVD on the changes we will all be experiencing in our already-in-progress shift in consciousness. They de-mystify all of the predictions surrounding 2012, and they answer plenty of questions relating to the personal lives of those in attendance. Shot at the beautiful Ojai Retreat Center in Ojai, CA, Khashyar Darvich has done a wonderful job of shooting, editing, and mixing sound on this DVD. Looking forward to the next one in the series already, I can easily make one prediction for 2012: I will watch this DVD over and over and over...",1326672000,5,635,5.115384615384615
8489352,5,B005YWDSMG,"I had been following Wendy Kennedy for a while before I discovered Nora Herold on the Rebecca Jernigan Show, but that first broadcast with Nora left me walking on air.  Then Wendy and Nora gave a dual session for ""the ground crew"" in Dec. 2010 and I knew this was the beginning of something special.  They began giving joint workshops in Ojai, CA in 2011 and now, thanks to the wonderful work of Khasyar Darvich, these amazing sessions are finally available to everyone on DVD.  Thank you Wendy, Nora and Khasyar!",1325980800,3,513,4.615384615384615
8489353,5,B005YWDSMG,"I'm so excited the DVD will be available soon! I've actually attended the session with Nora and Wendy in Ojai and I was so excited to hear about DVD release! I'm glad others have a chance to 'travel to the new dimension' with Nora and Wendy.  The session was very interesting, inspiring and provocative! I thought their speeches and interaction with the audience were extremely powerful.  I attended the second session in September too, but unfortunately missed the most recent one in October because of my work.... I'm really looking forward into purchasing this DVD series! Thanks Nora and Wendy and the film crew. Everyone was so friendly. I've got an enormous flow of positive energy once I left the event!!!",1319760000,5,712,4.87603305785124
