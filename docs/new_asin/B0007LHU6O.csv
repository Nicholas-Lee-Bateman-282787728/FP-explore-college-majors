8048287,5,B0007LHU6O,"AND WHEN THE SKY WAS OPENED is one of the best episodes from the First Season of The Twilight Zone. It was written by Rod Serling and based on Richard Matheson's short story ""Disappearing Act."" Three astronauts played by Rod Taylor, James Hutton and Charles Aidman return to earth from their space flight. Suddenly one astronaut disappears as though he never existed. And so it goes. This is a very interesting and unsettling episode. It was directed by Douglas Heyes and Charles Aidman, Rod Taylor and James Hutton give very realistic and convincing performances.
KICK THE CAN is a very moving, heart rendering and endearing episode from the Third Season of The Twilight Zone. Thematically it is similar to WALKING DISTANCE as a man living in a old age home refuses to give up his youth grow old. He insists there is magic in the world. This is absolutely one of the best written episodes of the entire series. It was written with such tenderness and passion by George Clayton Johnson and in certain scenes stock music composed by Bernard Herrmann from WALKING DISTANCE just make you want to reach out and hang on to the magic of youth, for only the old can truly appreciate it. Truly a classic episode all around. The cast of Ernest Treux, Russell Collins, Hank Patterson, Earle Hodgins, Burt Mustin, Gregory McCabe, Marjorie Bennett, Lenore Shanewise, Anne O'Neal, John Marley, Barry Treux, Eve McVeagh and Marc Stevens were just so perfect. It was beautifully directed by Lamont Johnson.
A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE Written by Richard Matheson and directed by Ted Post has Howard Duff as a business man who slowly finds that he is actually an actor tapped in the role of that business man and that his entire world is only a set for a film in which he has become a character. This is mind blowing and Howard Duff finally gets a chance to demonstrate what great range as an actor he truly had.
THE SILENCE seems like it would be more at home as an episode of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents."" However, Franchot Tone gives an excellent performance as an elder member of a parlor club who finds the ceaseless rhetorical chatter of a younger member (Liam Sullivan) too nauseating to bear. Franchot Tone offers Sullivan a half million dollars if he can keep silent for a full year. Jonathan Harris, Tone's friend advises him against making the bet but to no avail. Written by Rod Serling, this is actually one of his more memorable episodes from the Second Season of The Twilight Zone and is true to his ongoing theme of nostalgia for days or generations past. We have the old guard up butting up against the new, the more flamboyant, more self-assured and more modern thinking younger point of view. Yet, Franchot Tone does not fit into that category of endearment of an earlier generation, his age places him there, but not the man. That is what is so interesting about this episode. Also, thematically to the nature of The Twilight Zone, there are no elements of the fantastic, but simply twists of fate that shape the effect of this tale. Franchot Tone was a veteran motion picture star and an almost forgotten one at this point in his career and it is amazing to watch him in this episode directed by Boris Segal. It is so intriguing how the old guard faces off against the new. Rod Serling does not really give us a any feeling of optimism which he usually does for this theme as he did so endearingly in WALKING DISTANCE. This is a classic episode.",1380499200,,3443,4.655172413793103
8048288,5,B0007LHU6O,"There are no classic episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" on this particular volume of the Collector's edition, but the four episodes are all representative of the definitive television anthology series.  They also represent efforts by three different writers, which helps provide a nice mix of stories.  Because none of these are substandard zones, I end up rounding up on this quartet:

Episode 61, ""The Silence"" (Written by Rod Serling, First aired April 28, 1961) is a standout episode written by Serling that is unique in that it has no supernatural or science fiction elements, just an interesting bet. Archie Taylor (Franchot Tone) bets incessant talker Jamie Tennyson (Liam Sullivan) a half million dollars that he cannot stay quiet for a year. This was always one of my favorite Zones and I found out years later the reason Tone is shot only from profile for the middle part of the episode is because one side of his face had been scrapped open under mysterious circumstances that restricted the director's options in shooting the actor.  Joanthan Harris is the familiar face playing George Alfred.

Episode 86, ""Kick the Can"" (Written by George Clayton Johnson, First aired February 9, 1962) was Johnson's final script for the series, and was the episode adapted by Steven Spielberg in ""Twilight Zone: The Movie."" Charles Whitley (Ernest Truex) and his friend Ben Conory (Russell Collins) are residents of Sunnydale Rest, a home for the aged. Charles becomes convinced that the secret to being young is acting young, and one night he begs the others to join him for a game of kick-the-can. Everyone agrees to join in the game, except Ben. Of cousre, because this is the Twilight Zone, this is a tragic mistake.

Episode 23, ""A World of Difference"" (Written by Richard Matheson, First aired March 11, 1960), stars Howard Duff as Arthur Curtis, a businessman who is surprised to learn that his office is really a sound stage and that everybody thinks he is an actor named Jerry Raigan, an alcoholic movie star trying to salvage his career. This is one of the best ""Zone"" episodes to deal with the Kafkaesque question of whether you really are who you think you are.  Apparently not.  It is interesting to contrast Matheson's take on this theme as compared to Serling episodes like ""The After Hours"" and ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit,"" or even Charles Beaumont's ""Shadow Play.""

Episode 11, ""And When the Sky was Opened"" (Written by Rod Serling based on Richard Matheson's short story ""Disappearing Act,"" First aired December 11, 1959), tells of three astronauts who have just returned from their first space flight. Harrigan (Charles Aidman) calls home, is told by his parents that they have no son and then suddenly disappears. When Forbes (Rod Taylor) disappears, only Gart (James Hutton) is left from the crew.  But for how long before he disappears as well?",1123891200,2,2872,4.939834024896266
