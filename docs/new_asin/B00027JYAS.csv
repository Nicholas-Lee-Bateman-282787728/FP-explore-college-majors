2065162,1,B00027JYAS,"""Spinout"" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema  a bad sitcom without the laugh track.

And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King?  She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before!  Elvis looks embarrassed.  Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way.",1114992000,6,655,4.4789915966386555
2065165,4,B00027JYAS,"""Spinout"" is neither the best nor the worst Elvis movie of the 60's.  But it is represenative of most of his films and thus a good movie for Elvis newbies to gauge whether they want to see any more from da' King.

The Plot? Well, here goes;

Elvis and his bandmates (who are also his pit crew) run across a millionaire's daughter & a attractive journalist who want Elvis as their trophy husband.  The band's drummer (whose also a gourmet cook) is also smitten with the King.  The millionaire wants Elvis as well, but only to drive his new race car.  In the end, everyone is racin', dancin', & finally gettin' married.  But which one (of any of them) does Elvis chose?

The songs are above average for a typical Elvis flick, lead off by the snappy rock number ""Stop, Look, Listen"".  Other highlights include ""Adam & Evil"", ""All That I Am"", and the swaggering ""I'll Be Back"".

""Spinout"" is perfect drive-in fare where the details of the plot should really be ignored if you're going to enjoy the film.  Although I'll admit that some of it is so bad it's funny.  Take for example the late night dinner scene that happens early in the film.  Elvis manages to light a campfire simply by dropping a lit match on a small pile of dry wood (try that the next time your camping).  Or how Elvis 'n bandmates manage to organize a pool party overnight to wake the millionaire up at dawn. Not to mention the band itself seems only vaguely familiar with how their instraments work.  The fetching Deborah Wally seems completely lost while trying to maintain a beat.

The rest of the cast is fine, if not really outstanding.  Shelly Fabares is appropriately spoiled, yet radient as the millionaire's daughter.  Diane McBain is the quinessential cool blond jounalist who pops out of nowhere from time to time.  And Warren Berlinger is in perfect sit-com form as the hapless assitant to the millionaire whose desparately in love with Fabares.

The film does have stretches where nothing really happens and the most groan inducing moment is when Elvis identifies a wondering mutt as a ""Hound Dog"".  Elvis himself seems rather bored all through the film and his eyes are noticably hazy, as if...well, I'll leave any explaination for why up to y'all.

For those who love Elvis and enjoy his films, this one is for you.  For those who are curious, ""Spinout"" is a good introduction and is just entertaining enough to pass a lazy afternoon.

Some extra trivia:
* - Cecil Kelloway & Una Merkel make their final movie appearence as the old couple that Elvis tricks into taking their second honeymoon.  There characters are not the sharpest knives in the drawer considering that they leave their mansion in the hands of a total stranger whose a rock musician.

* - Note the first wide shot of the club that Elvis performs ""Stop, Look, Listen"".  You'll see everyone movin' & dancin' to the song, including the guy on the phone.

* - One member of the band ""plays"" a double-necked guitar, which was just coming into prominence at the time.

* - The ad line for ""Spinout"" was ""Elvis marries three women at once.""  It turns out to be literally true, but not in the way you might think.",1102636800,6,3153,4.588550983899821
2065166,5,B00027JYAS,"Hooray, SPINOUT on DVD at last!  One of Elvis' 60s movies, about which all you can say is, if you like them, you love them.  Somewhere along the way, Elvis stopped really caring about everything except Gladys, and the scripts suffered.  They were all the same with plenty of innuendo, but not much real sex.  Except of course that sex is omnipresent in the air, it's built into each frame of film like a poltergeist nimbus in a haunted house.  SPINOUT features Elvis opposite the perplexing pixie Deborah Walley, who often played a kind of tomboyish girl yearning to be a woman, the parts Debbie Reynolds owned a decade earlier.  And yet Walley is extremely sexy, just not in this film.  The other guys Elvis has to compete with aren't in his league, but they're not bad looking, at least Will Sugarfoot Hutchins and Carl Betz from the Donna Reed Show are passable and here even Warren Berlinger from BILLIE looks pretty sharp.

However in every department the women outclass them, from Deborah Walley in torn sweatshirts and pink Capris, to ultra-chic Diane McBain an ""author"" like Helen Gurley Brown of sex manuals for bachelorettes, to Shelley Fabares, the millionaire daughter of Carl Betz--a casting move that will leave you scratching your head if you remember her playing the same part in The Donna Reed Show.  As many have noted, the final number is the best--I'LL BE BACK, sung by Elvis and band in a bohemian basement nightclub with weird proto-Dufy paintings on the walls and candles stuck in Chianti bottles, and the band drives the crowd to their feet eventually, everyone doing the Frug and the Monkey in wild 60s abandon.",1092700800,7,1636,4.773049645390071

2065183,3,B00027JYAS,"Released in 1966, Spinout was Elvis 22nd movie. He would do nine more in the next three years before closing the door on cinema forever. Ive seen most of his films and own many. Some are better than others depending on what you want. Roustabout (1964) is my favorite simply because it has the most compelling story, and the story  including the way its told  is the most important part of a movie in my book.

In Spinout Elvis plays Mike McCoy, a singer/guitarist of a band that lives like well-to-do gypsies, living a nomadic life in tents. Amazingly, he also races on the side with his band members assisting in the pits. As usual, every woman is attracted to the character played by Elvis (McCoy). In this case there are three who desperately want to marry him: the tomboy drummer of his band (Deborah Walley), a spoiled heiress (Shelley Fabares) and a woman writing a book on him (Diane McBain). Carl Betz plays the heiress rich father who wants McCoy to drive his fancy new racecar, but also to stay away from his daughter. Jack Mullaney, Will Hutchins and Dodie Marshall are also on hand.

These types of movies aren't meant to be taken too seriously. They exist as vehicles for Elvis talents and to entertain with fun 60s shenanigans. Youre not supposed to scrutinize em too closely. But sometimes the writing is so stoo-pid it takes you right out of the story. One quick example from Spinout: McCoy (Elvis) wants to temporarily move into the mansion next door to the heiress and her rich dad so he charms the elderly neighbors and convinces them to immediately go on a second honeymoon while he and his bandmates  perfect strangers  stay at their mansion. Why sure! Elements like this make it seem like they enlisted a 14 year-old to assist with the script.

Still, Spinout fills the bill if you need a brainless-but-amusing mid-60s fix.

The film runs 90 minutes and was shot in Southern California.

2065224,3,B00027JYAS,"Spinout is possibly just above average in Elvis' body of work. He does have a nice supporting cast in Shelley Fabares, Diane McBain, Deborah Walley, Will Hutchins, Warren Berlinger, and Carl Betz. All are personable and believable in their roles.

In Spinout, Elvis is once again a musically inclined race car driver. This time he runs a four member band, and through the course of the movie has to fend off the attentions of three beautiful ladies. My favorite scene is Elvis charming a rich elderly couple out of the use of their house as he convinces them to go on a second honeymoon. You get a bit of a different ending for an Elvis movie, as most of the time you are used to him falling in love with the female lead to live (supposedly) happily ever after.

Like many Elvis movies, there is no high art here. But you do get to know a likable group of people. Also like a lot of Elvis movies, there are no bad guys, just ego conflicts between various people you come to like (much like Clambake and Viva Las Vegas). Its an enjoyable bit of escapism, and another chance to see one of the best singers and most dynamic entertainers of rock and roll deliver some quite entertaining numbers onscreen. Let's face it, Elvis was entertaining even when delivering average acting performances, and we're 40+ years out from his last film. We have to take what was made, and luckily that's most often good enough.

Recommended as relaxing and light entertainment.",1319068800,3,1456,4.592307692307692
2065225,4,B00027JYAS,"Spinout (1966) is a light fun romp featuring Elvis Presley rocking as the member of a travelling band, pursued by a trio of beautiful girls.  Director Norman Taurog finished his distinguished career, primarily working on films featuring Elvis Presley.  This time, the story is slightly more grounded in reality than usual, as being in a band provides ample opportunities to feature musical numbers, and the action is spiced up with scenes featuring cars racing.

Elvis is Mike McCoy, the leader of a rock band out on tour, who also races cars in his spare time.  McCoy and the band travel between gigs in a Model J Duisenberg, with a trailer carrying his Cobra 427 racer and the band's gear in tow.  The band's female drummer, and resident gourmet chef Les (Deborah Walley), has a secretly crush on Mike, but she doesn't have much of a chance, as everyone regards her as just one of the boys.  Diana St. Clair (Diane McBain) an author who writes books about men, also has her sights on Mike as the subject of her next book, and perhaps even matrimony.

Things get more complicated, when millionaire businessman Howard Foxhugh (Carl Betz) uses his influence to force Mike and the band to come to Santa Barbara to perform at his mansion for his daughter Cynthia's birthday.  Mike has already had a run in with Cynthia (Shelley Fabares), an angel-faced but spoiled little daddy's girl, who soon also falls for Mike, after he sings the touching ""Am I Ready"" for her.  Foxhugh offers Mike a job driving his new race car the Fox Five, and then tries to force the band to leave town when he declines.  But Mike manages to take up residence in Ranley Manor, the mansion adjoining the Foxhugh residence.  For the upcoming Santa Fe road race Foxhugh has offered a $50,000 prize to the winner, setting up the movie's exciting and fun finish.  The racing angle takes a while to get going, but it adds some color and excitement at the finish, as Cynthia's boyfriend Philip Short (Warren Berlinger) becomes an unauthorized participant in the race.

The musical numbers are a highlight and they seem to fit smoothly into the flow of the action.  ""Stop Look and Listen"" is an all out rocker that kickstarts the movie.  ""Never Say Yes"", and ""Adam And Evil"" are fun tunes performed live.  ""Beach Shack"" is a fun poolside number, and the title song ""Spinout"" is performed at a rocking party among an ocean of girls.

The film features very good performances from Carl Betz, Shelley Fabares, and Warren Berlinger.  Fabares looks cool and dreamy in so many of her scenes.  Deborah Walley's looks are played down to look like a boy, but she rocks it very convincingly on the drums.  The Diana St. Clair character seems a bit out of place, and forced into some of the situations, but she does fit nicely into a role at the end.  Spinout is more of the light fluff that should please most Presley fans.  Elvis is quite charming, the music is very good, and the musical performances are energetic and entertaining, helping to bolster what is mostly an average story.  Spinout is also available in a double feature with Double Trouble (1967) on a flipper disc&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spinout-Double-Trouble/dp/B0009UZG6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spinout/Double Trouble</a>.",1318118400,,3300,4.938405797101449
