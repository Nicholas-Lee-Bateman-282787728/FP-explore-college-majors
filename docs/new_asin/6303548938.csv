7850571,5,6303548938,This is a long time favorite with a good stretch and easy workout.  I would be the first on in line if it were to come out on DVD.,1421280000,,130,3.4827586206896552
7850572,5,6303548938,"This workout really pushes my limits, but is SO satisfying. I'm a beginner at working out, and it makes me want to do more. I feel very proud of being able to complete the workout. It starts with some warmup and stretching  which is quite easy, then there's a few minutes of whew! hard leg and abs  exercises, but it feels very well rounded. SOme people might be annoyed by  Greg Smithey. He says stuff like ""I knew you could do it"" and  ""you look fantastic"" and ""I'm proud of you"" - I'm a  little embarrassed to like it, but it does make me feel good and motivates  me to exercise. I feel GREAT!",954806400,6,596,4.184210526315789
7850573,5,6303548938,I just did this video this morning and I found it to be the prefect amount of exercise for a beginner.  Not too easy not~too hard.  I am here looking for the other Startin' SImple videos!,940291200,2,187,4.166666666666667
7850574,1,6303548938,"I would NOT recommend this video for beginners.  I am over 40 and wanted exercises to just tone my body. A video that I wouldn't mind exercising with every day and not dread it. These exercises are very hard to me.  It  was nothing like I expected for beginners as the subject stated, ""Easy  Toning"".  These exercises are ones that I did maybe 20 years ago and  were too hard for me then.",926294400,2,388,4.2465753424657535
