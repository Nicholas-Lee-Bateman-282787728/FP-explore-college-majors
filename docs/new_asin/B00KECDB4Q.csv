8658112,3,B00KECDB4Q,"This review is for Virtual Walks - Kuala Lumpur for indoor walking, treadmill and cycling workouts.  I'm on the fence with this one and I'll tell you why.
The scenery is lovely and you get the bonus of people jogging past you or walking, or just going about their daily activities which I did enjoy.  The pace is a slower one and if that doesn't bother you, great.  You experience sunshine, rain and sunset/evening so the variety there is better then most.  The problem I had with the DVD, was the limited area explored.  You would head in one direction for a short time and then quite obviously double back.  Yes, you got to see the flip side of the area but the area explored, I felt, was very limited.  I kept finding myself saying, ""And we're turning around.""  I'll use the DVD again, there are just other DVD's I like better.",1519862400,,830,4.4144736842105265
8658113,5,B00KECDB4Q,I did my walk exercise with this DVD today.  It is absolute perfection.  Talk about High Definition.  The best quality cinematography EVER.  Whoever is the Film Master is most deserving of many awards.  Breathtaking!,1458086400,,216,5.235294117647059
8658114,5,B00KECDB4Q,"In this DVD you can see a part of Kuala Lumpur. In the first two videos you walk through parks with beautiful vegetation. Some paths lead along the water and in the background you can often see imposing skyscrapers. Sometimes you walk in the sunshine under palm trees and over small bridges, but you also run or walk in the rain. I also really like the third video. Here you can walk through the city at dusk and at night. Beautifully illuminated buildings and streets, as well as colorful illuminated fountains can be seen there. The background noise fits perfectly with the videos. A varied DVD for exercising with treadmills or exercise bikes.",1432771200,,646,4.725663716814159
8658115,5,B00KECDB4Q,"I have so many of VW DVDs and I must say I am never disappointed in any of them. I was so surprised to see that some people were not happy but I can't figure out why. Kuala Lumpur has all you need it has 2 walks in the beautiful  parks and one in the city. One thing that I really enjoy is that they are done during the day and night, that fits in with my walks because I walk at different times of the day and it makes you feel like you are there walking. Also I think it says a lot that Tony does these walks in the rain,cold,snow whatever the weather I love that. You will see a little of everything in this walk palm trees, ponds, lakes, paths that are designed in different colors and patterns, people walking by you,buildings. The park ones are relaxing and you have a lot to see and hear people laughing and talking, hear the birds singing. The one of the city is at night so you hear night sounds, traffic, it also sounds like prayers over the loud speakers, fountains. The lights of the city are nice and you will go down different streets in the city and get a feel of what it is like there. Sometimes I want a nature walk and sometimes I like to visit the city so this one has all you need. You can also bike with this one also because of the pace. Thanks again for a beautiful DVD. Keep them coming they are great!",1414368000,4,1326,4.0418250950570345
8658116,4,B00KECDB4Q,"Hi All:

Virtual Walks (""VW"") has been a great motivator for me to not only continue my treadmill exercise program throughout the years, but also to actually look forward to it.  I have bought enough of these DVDs to get a pretty good feel for the product line as a whole.  Sure, there are some DVDs that were not what I had expected, but others have certainly filled the gap in that regard.  I have found that this whole deal comes down to a matter of personal taste and preference.

Also, I have happily discovered that many of those DVDs which were initially disappointing have come into their own over time.  For example, at first I was all hyped up about looking at buildings and people.  Some DVDs accomplish this task very well.  However, after awhile I discovered that I had grown tired of buildings and people and wanted something more solitary, so I can choose a DVD from out of my stash to fill that bill as well.  I have found that a mixture of DVDs from VW gives me a good overall long range incentive.  For example, sometimes I get obsessed with a DVD and run it ten times in a row.  And then, when I get bored or tired of the genre, I can jump to the next.

I have tried other DVDs (for example Scenic Trex and VITA Digital Productions) and although they may have different subject matter, the overall quality just doesn't seem to be there like it is with VW.

Specifically, with VW:

The stabilizing system is outstanding.  Good job, guys!

The HD video quality of VW is certainly better than what I've encountered with Scenic Trex or VITA, even though they both claim to be HD.  I have a large screen in front of my treadmill, so even HD is not as sharp as I would like it to be when it gets blown up that big, but nevertheless it is still good enough to keep me coming back for more.

One thing you may not have thought about is the video speed.

The walking speed instead of running speed allows me to spend more time on the treadmill before giving up sooner than I would like because I'm exhausted.  I like realism, and have discovered that when I'm walking on the treadmill while the video is flying forward at running speed, that it simply is not as realistic to me as when I'm running on the treadmill with the video at walking speed.  Call me a woose.

Two VW DVD's (Rome and Paris) do not show a DVD preview, and this needs to be corrected.  I'm not going to buy sight unseen.

When I contacted VW and asked them if it would be possible to make a DVD covering a specific walk (starting at The Wedge in Balboa Beach, Southern California, USA, then north through Newport Beach, Huntington Beach and on up to Long Beach) they said they would put it in the queue, so hopefully this one will come out in time.  I think it would be a great addition to VW, but I know Tony has a lot on his plate.

Hope this helps.

8658117,5,B00KECDB4Q,"I watched this DVD from start to finish and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole video. It's a beautiful place, whether in the daytime (Walks 1 and 2), or evening (Walk 3) The scenery is so good and you even feel like you're right in the rain shower on the one walk. This is as close as I'll ever get to seeing a different country and I appreciate that there are videos like this out there so I can see glimpses of the other side of the world. The buildings are amazing and I loved the waterfall fountain with the changing colors. It's so relaxing for me. The gardens are so pretty - everything is so green and inviting. This actually encourages me to walk on the treadmill - I want to see it again -  I love it!",1413504000,,706,4.115942028985507
8658118,5,B00KECDB4Q,"Kuala Lumpur is a place youll want to visit next time you're on the treadmill or spin-bike. What other place do you know of that has three forest reserves in the middle of the city? You can walk, jog or peddle through the 230 acres of enchanting Lake Gardens and never get bored.

But, if you crave the excitement of urban scenery, you can jog or peddle into the architectural wonderland of Kuala Lumpur, and marvel at the mixture of colonial, religious, and Asian designsfrom towering sky scrapers to urban temples.

And thats what makes this DVD such a valuable resource for your workouts: its interesting! The time flies by as you explore this exotic locale, which offers the beauties of Nature and the beauties of breathtaking architecture. It is a workout DVD youll want to replay again and again. Jog in the park if you want, or peddle through the city, or loop the workout scenes so that you get the best of both worlds. This is a great workout experience.",1413331200,2,963,4.593023255813954
8658119,5,B00KECDB4Q,I totally disagree with the other review here. This DVD is great and really quite spectacular. How fast do you want it to go! It is as the others in the collection simply beautiful and boy! does it make you exercise better. My wife and I HATE exercises but hate our waistlines even more so this unique collection has been a fantastic help for us both. We never would have the chance to visit KL so to be honest being able to run through its main square is a real joy. You could easily think you might get bored with it but no.... there is so much detail that you can run time and again and still see things. A fantastic idea and so well executed that I cannot recommend it enough!,1413331200,,680,4.159090909090909
8658120,3,B00KECDB4Q,"I was really looking forward to this one (I have others, which are excellent), but I found it not as good as the others.  The walks are not as interesting.  Also, I found the pace slower, more like a leisurely walk and not a brisk walk as in other DVDs in this series.",1408492800,,268,4.037735849056604
