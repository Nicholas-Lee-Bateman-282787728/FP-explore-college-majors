8054248,3,B0007YMVLA,"Yes, there are five films in this set, and each presented with its own disc and case, but Gordon Liu IS NOT in any of these five films. Instead, Gordon - who has aged really gracefully - hosts these films (and by ""hosts,"" I mean he poses for the camera and says stuff like ""You are watching VideoAsia""), is featured in a 7-minute interview, and even participates in two martial arts demos (these same bonus features can be found on each of the five discs). VideoAsia didn't do much in the way of bells and whistles with the films themselves. These are bare bones productions. All the films are in full screen format, and all the films but one are presented in awkward English dub (no sub-titles). The one exception is SNAKE IN THE CRANE'S SHADOW which offers you the choice of viewing either the English-dubbed version or the original uncut Mandarin version with barely legible English sub-titles. However, the films themselves, while dated, aren't so shabby, gracing us with old school kung fu moves and acrobatics and those cheesy-cool sound effects. Each disc also offers the ""Insta-Action"" function which propels the viewer straight to the film's fight sequences.

- SHAOLIN INVINCIBLE STICKS (1978)

""There was a time when the stick was the most important weapon in ancient China,"" remarks the voiceover narrator who then proceeds to break down the assortment of sticks and poles and staves utilized as a martial arts weapon. Lau Kar-Leung, one of the most influential directors of wushu cinema, would approve of SHAOLIN INVINCIBLE STICKS, never mind that it isn't quite as accomplished as his own EIGHT DIAGRAM POLE FIGHTER. SHAOLIN INVINCIBLE STICKS is the best film in this collection.

The plot is fairly straight-forward. Wang Tao plays Chen Ku-yung, the indolent heir to a famous stick fighting family, except that he's ousted from the clan when he fails to demonstrate adequate mastery over the fam's preferred weapons. Meanwhile, a vicious kung fu master (Chang Yi, sporting that sinister Silver Fox look) roams the countryside with his two apprentices, testing and then killing all stick fighters they encounter. And we see where this is headed. As these killers inevitably work their way to Chen Ku-yung's family, can our embittered young exile hone his fighting skills well enough to survive the coming battle?

SHAOLIN INVINCIBLE STICKS won't dazzle you with brilliant storytelling or inspired acting. But the combat choreography is off the hook. The viewer gets treated to some pretty sick exhibitions of stick fighting, whether you prefer the three-sectioned staff or the iron rod or the extendable pole. It's worth sticking around for the climactic showdown in the bamboo grove alone. Wang Tao is no great shakes as a thespian but he's buff and exudes a great physical presence. The humor is pretty despicable as we see another incarnation of the swishy idiot son and the oaf with the hairy, hairy mole. However, I got a kick out of the film's persistently heralding Chang Yi's homicidal presence with his very own strident musical score.

- SNAKE IN THE CRANE'S SHADOW (1978)

There are two jade keys which every twenty years can unlock the Death's Gate, behind which are stored vast riches. In two weeks' time, the Death's Gate unlocks once more, and so gather the uneasy company of treasure hunters. This instance sees a fairly promising bunch: a blind woman fighter (Doris Lung), the one-legged Lame Dragon (who could also be the notorious Unicorn), an assassin-for-hire called the Eight Step Killer (Lung Tuen-hsing), a clean cut fellow who wields a lethal flying cape (sort of a poor cousin to the flying guillotine), and an annoying trio of bumbling ne'er-do'wells, all of them circling one another warily, angling for an edge.

Alternatively titled ADVENTURE OF HEAVEN MOUSE and not to be confused with SNAKE IN THE EAGLE'S SHADOW or SNAKE AND CRANE ARTS OF SHAOLIN or SNAKE IN THE MONKEY'S SHADOW (all of which are much superior efforts), SNAKE IN THE CRANE'S SHADOW suffers from an incomprehensible mash-up of kung fu action, vague character arcs, and heinous comedy, with way too much focus on the comedy. These characters had potential, and it seemed that we were in for an intriguing four-way tug-of-war. The presence of the blind woman fighter (who seems to be the central character by default) and the guy with the crutch who keeps trailing her had me anticipating some refreshing cripple kung fu. But that never does materialize. However, the martial arts we see is passable fare. Doris Lung exudes a self-assured charisma and exhibits some flair for kung fu, but her skills aren't showcased enough. And, ultimately, the film collapses under the weight of an inscrutable plot and the exhausting antics of the ragtag Mouse Trio. I'm actually mad at Gordon Liu for attaching his name to this sorry bit of unwatchable.

- DEATH DUEL OF THE MANTIS (1978)

Hsiao Hai (Hua Chung Ting) is a good-natured, much bullied orphan who toils away for local entrepreneur Master Lu (Fei Lung). Crushing hard on the noodle vendor's feisty daughter Ho Hwa (Yin-fei Kam) and desperate to fend off the neighborhood thugs, Hsiao's stab at self-improvement consists of practicing kung fu, but he sort of sucks. That is, until Master Lu takes pity on him, takes him under his wing, teaches him the rudiments of the chicken fist style. DEATH DUEL OF THE MANTIS provides several entertaining fighty fights, with Hua Chung Ting - whom I've never heard of before - owning nifty moves as he serves up both chicken and mantis fists. The chicken fist obviously isn't as traditional as the mantis form, leaning towards rigid postures and unorthodox and wackadoo movements. But as Hua Chung Ting and Fei Lung demonstrate, the chicken fist can be fearsome. Meanwhile, Yin-fei Kam threatens to steal several scenes with her own exhibition of kung fu. The plot is whatever. It concerns the central character's clumsy wooing of the noodle girl and his ascension in Mr. Lu's ranks and culminates in his having to choose between his allegiance to Master Lu - who, it turns out, isn't quite the upstanding citizen - and doing the right thing. There is some clowning around here, but nothing as egregiously awful as the sheer buffoonery displayed in SNAKE IN THE CRANE'S SHADOW.

- MANTIS IN THE MONKEY'S SHADOW (1979)

Also known as PHANTOM KUNG FU, its plot revolves around the theft of a key government document and the attempts to recover it. The suspect is the rebel Chiao Yu-pai (Wang Tao), purported to have studied Magic Spiritual Kung Fu (or Phantom Kung Fu). The monarch of the reigning Ching dynasty deploys the sadistic Cha Ta-chu (Chang Yi), master of the Palm of Death. Cha Ta-chu is given a month to retrieve the document. And if the bristling mustache doesn't give it away, then Cha Ta-chu's ripping the head off an innocent bird may clue you in that this is the bad guy of the piece.

MANTIS IN THE MONKEY'S SHADOW offers decent fighty fights, but the story may generate a lukewarm reaction. This is one of them peculiar martial arts films in which the villain accrues more screen time than the protagonist. Chang Yi plays a villain so formidable that he effortlessly plows thru the roster of the Ming rebel movement. The prudent (and chubby) Master of the Five Dragons is easily dismissed. And cross the reclusive martial arts master Yin Ping (Ching Ming) and his brother Drunken Monkey off the list (although these last two and Chang Yi provide the film's highlight fight sequence). Not even Chiao Yu-pai's vaunted phantom kung fu can distress our main villain too much. And it's no wonder. Chiao Yu-pai proves to be a pathetic hero, returning from the dead time and again only to be repeatedly slaughtered by the big bad. His demonstration of spectral abilities isn't so impressive, consisting mostly of his hurling pointy objects, taunting, and then running away a lot.

- THE RIVALS OF THE SILVER FOX (1985)

This one had the potential to be epic, until the over-the-top fight choreography sabotaged the thing. In the kingdom of wushu, no one is more feared than the priest Wu Kuo, more notoriously known as the Silver Fox (Phillip Ko). Silver Fox's geriatric appearance belies the villain's insatiable ambition and an awesome mastery of kung fu. But, damn, don't get bamboozled by the title, the Silver Fox is a shadow of himself in this one and is barely onscreen. He's not even the big bad.

When the vile Ma Tien-shun takes over the Devil Valley Lodge and its army of Silver-Bronze warriors, it's a new turn of events that chafes at a diverse group of martial artists, strangers to each other. Among those who seek to challenge Ma Tien-shun's reign are the mischievous Invisible Thief, the imperious Silver Fox, and a vengeance-minded fighter (Casanova Wong) traveling with his infant son. The narrative is pretty complex but easily tracked, with a solid performance turned in by Casanova Wong (who, you must admit, has a very cool name).

THE RIVALS OF THE SILVER FOX is action-heavy, even if some of the sequences are cranked up by the camera. But, as mentioned, the action is also what stops the film from achieving cult classic status. The elaborate choreography eventually lends to a sense of silliness. And those silver warriors with the cymbals are just sad; their method of asssault is to encircle their prey and bang the hell out of their cymbals, causing their victim's ears to bleed out. And how is it that not until the Invisible Thief points out the weaknesses on the bronze men - as indicated by these obvious red dots on their bodies - do these red dots actually manifest themselves? (No, they weren't there before.) Once Casanova Wong begins targeting these attack points, the bronze adversaries capitulate rapidly. It's a pretty sizable plot hole. And I won't even rant about how most of the bronze warriors seem to be running around in orderly circles which allows the few invaders to face only a few of them at a time. I do want to mention that I had some trouble getting the DVD to play straight thru as it prefered to skip over the slow bits where people have to act and instead jumped directly to the action sequences. Hopefully, it's just my DVD and not yours, too.",1321660800,4,10210,4.865937859608746
