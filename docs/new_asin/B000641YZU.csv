It is a dark and stormy night. One girl prepares to go on her honeymoon. Danny arrives with the train tickets. Doris tells about her father and his invention. [Could someone be spying on him?] Surreptitious drinking tells you Prohibition is in effect. The couples arrive at the train station and hire a taxi. [Comic relief?] A man arrives to see Professor Farrington. Judge Folger learns about a new source of ""free power"" from sunlight. There is an intruder in the laboratory. The candle goes out, the judge is found on the floor. He won't talk. Then the Professor disappears. Is there a secret door? A man peers into the window. Another strange man enters the laboratory and asks questions. There is comic relief. The caretaker will go for the police as there is no telephone. Another body is found, then disappears. More comic relief from Freddy. A scream recalls the men.

Two men are fighting outside. Will the couples run there to allow someone to search the room? The people outside see a man carrying a body back at the house. ""There is a way of making you tell."" Freddy provides more comic relief. A mysterious figure follows him. A man lures Doris out of the room and carries her to where her father is imprisoned. Will her father write the secret formula now? Danny chases the man to the rooftop. Will Danny arrive in time to rescue Doris and her father? There will be a happy ending. The villain behind the conspiracy is arrested for the murder of Judge Folger.

Aside from the low budget the film has too many mysterious events which distract from the story.",1271203200,,1598,4.619718309859155
8038254,3,B000641YZU,"The brilliant recluse Dr. Farrington (Frank Ball) has just completed his invention. The VXO Accumulator, a device that can harness the sun's rays and offer free energy to everyone. He discloses this information to his friend Judge Folger (Phillip Smalley) and plans to give it to the world tomorrow.

 Wait! What's this? The lights go out. When the lights come on Judge Folger is dead and soon Dr. Farrington disappears.

The search for Dr. Farrington goes on by his daughter (Josephine Dunn) and soon-to-be son-in-law (Jack Mulhall.) Meanwhile we have mysterious viewers, long fingered creeps, hidden panels, and it appears that someone will be murdered at dawn.

This is a 1932 black-and-white whodunit. The only version I saw was the Alpha video DVD. It needs a little cleaning up.",1262476800,,784,5.054263565891473
8038255,3,B000641YZU,"Early murder mystery with elements of sci-fi.  The Alpha DVD is not that great, but acceptable.  However, there does seem to be some missing footage",1242950400,,148,4.88
8038256,1,B000641YZU,"The second recorded deployment of Kenneth Strickfaden's fabulous fantasy lab equipment (following the original Frankenstein), is the sole element apt to please viewers of this wearisome essay at creating an Old Dark House mystery, wherein stabs taken toward comedy and suspense are less than persuasive, and production values in this low-budget affair are anaemic.  Danny (Jack Mulhall) and Doris (Josephine Dunn), in order to avoid a stall in their marriage plans, entrain with married chums Freddie (Eddie Boland) and Gertrude (Marjorie Beebe) to the mountain hermitage of Dr. Farrington, inventor father of Doris, to gain his consent for their wedding, and on a dark and stormy night (as can be noted from repeated footage of identical flashes of lightning), with the film striving for a general atmosphere of malevolence, the quartet arrives at Farrington's aerie.  Meanwhile, the doctor is seen demonstrating his latest brainchild, a ""VXO Accumulator"", to a visiting colleague, Judge Folger, a contrivance that will purportedly mine the sun's rays for the development of free power that will benefit mankind, but as the device might also be utilized for evil, the stage is set for harrowing proceedings.  These include Folger's murder, along with the kidnapping of Farrington, all while the bewildered young couples try to stay out of harm's way from such as secret passages and trap doors, disappearing corpses, a sinister caretaker played by Mischa Auer (complete with maniacal cackling laughter), in addition to two other men who skulk about the grounds (one of whom is dropped, unidentified as to name or purpose, by the script); notwithstanding these melodramatic events, the film is bare of moments that may be interesting to a sensate viewer.  In truth, from its very beginning, this is a poor film, and even with the surfeit of ominous occurrences tossed at us, the work is so substandard that a viewer eventually is resigned to merely studying the sequences to wonder at examples of what are not only distinctly tedious goings-on but risible as well, the script, direction, acting, and editing being as atrocious as can be imagined.",1142121600,3,2146,5.229651162790698
