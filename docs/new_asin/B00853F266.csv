8525207,5,B00853F266,This moving and beautifully crafted New Zealand film told me as much about myself as about the real life characters. I will treasure it.,1494979200,,136,4.708333333333333
8525208,5,B00853F266,"This film is both complex and beautifully simple.  Summed up in one sequence ""What do you do for a living?"" ""I live for a living""... It's a story of family, relationships, life and living it for one extraordinary family.  Finding what's important and what's not. This film raises intelligent questions about the nature of living and working in this modern world, raising a family, and others' expectations.  It would be very easy to label this family in a number of ways, but looking closely none of those labels really apply. For horse lovers of course, the central tenant of 'this way of life' is that it intertwined with the horses; in fact horses are integral to this family's life.

Brilliant.  Watch it.",1364860800,,709,4.778688524590164
8525209,5,B00853F266,"We initially watched this documentary because of the horsing and the general lifestyle of New Zealand. We are parents to 2 young children and this family embodies the goals we have for our parenting. We watch when we need a reminder of a positive, gentle and empowering parenting style.",1358208000,,286,4.857142857142857
8525210,5,B00853F266,"Hard to find words really, it was a wonderous and moving film. My teenage son and I watched it together and it holds a special place for us. It is a movie we are so glad to own and it is considered a ""gift"" in our home---not many films reach that status for us! Enjoy....",1356393600,2,271,3.9454545454545453
8525211,5,B00853F266,"If you are fortunate enough to experience ""This Way of Life"" you will understand the clunky title of this little review.  Paying attention is a constant problem for me, but this film of a real life couple struggling to live free and raise their six spirited children with love, freedom and responsibility riveted me. It moved me so I watched it again that same night and was equally absorbed. Days later my wife and I watched it together. She was equally enthralled.

The New Zealand scenery is spectacular though the living conditions are sometimes gritty. Peter and Colleen Karena are unassuming yet frequently appear heroic whether confronting serious challenges or carrying out everyday chores. They speak eloquently of their lives. The children are a delight. For me the beauty, tension and wonder of this film is summed up when the smallest rider is suddenly thrown from his Large racing horse. The camera films from a distance but you clearly see the boy immediately rebounding from the sandy ground.  After smacking the ground he runs after his siblings and mother, is lifted back onto his mount and continues riding.

Oh, . . . I diligently practice sharpening my knife but it will be a while before I can produce the fine edge regularly achieved by Peter Karena.",1345852800,5,1272,4.875
8525212,5,B00853F266,Peter & his wife Colleen live simply & raise their 6 kids without TV's or electronics but give them so much love. This movie was beautifully shot & shows what a family should be.,1340409600,3,178,4.264705882352941
