Have you ever watched an MMA or BJJ bout and wondered what just happened?  How did the champion end that scramble or escape that submission and take the win?  What was that weird technique he used?

Well, look no further!  Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira's Mixed Martial Arts: The Ultimate Instructional Set is here, and Half, Inside Hooks, & Downed Guards for MMA is another great volume in this three-DVD set.

The disc is broken up into three main parts:
Inside Hooks Guard
Half Guard
Downed Guard

* Body Lock Sweep (sets up side control, then the mount)
* Underhook Reverse Sweep (moves from butterfly guard to side control dominance)

* Arm Drag To Back Transition (used to progress from inside hooks guard to taking his back and applying RNC)
