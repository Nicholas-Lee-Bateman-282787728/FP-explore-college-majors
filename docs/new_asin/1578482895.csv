196617,5,1578482895,"I am reviewing the budget version of this film which is available on the Sterling label. I paid about $6 for this dvd which I thoroughly enjoyed the first time I rented it. This budget version differs from the original A Pix version: There are no commentaries/alternate endings with this Sterling version. If you want those extras, you'll have to buy the other version. No captioning bothered me since I am so used to having that option. But since I listen with headphones, this isn't a problem. Picture quality is very good with some slight grain. Audio is 2ch despite what is printed on the keep case: Dolby Digital Stereo, it isn't. Minor complaints however considering the first-rate cast and excellent performances by all: Juliette Lewis as our victim-who-gets-run-through-the-mill by a creepy neighbor(Austin Pendleton), William Hurt as her 'I warned you' boyfriend, Shelly Duvall as the nosy oddball landlady. There is of course the apartment building with a long history and sinister feel about it, darkly-lit as well. I was reminded a lot of 'Rear Window'. I should also mention Tobin Bell as the beady-eyed handyman who has a secret. A perfect mix of atmospherics, characters, mood, pacing, score and the suprise ending. Quite a lot of six bucks.",1083715200,8,1256,5.014354066985646
196618,2,1578482895,"A good movie, good direction, good acting but the end is just a bit too weak. A lot of scenes will remind you masterpieces such as Rosemary's baby and Rear Window. Impossible not to think about them. Anyway, the end could have been 10 000 times creepier. A pity ! Finally the lack of several individuals make easy to guess who the bad guy is. I would have loved to see more of the tenants and if possible created by David Lynch ;o)",1069977600,2,431,4.204819277108434
196619,1,1578482895,"This movie was a 90 minute foot cramp.  The inane plot, which attempts to appear both complicated and esoteric through use of classical references ends up being a complete and utterly predictable mess.  None of the characters are given any life by either the script or the actors.  The guiltiest of the lot is Juliette Lewis.  Barely able to keep up with other actors as a co-star (see Natural Born Killers) she simply fails as a leading lady.  The only enjoyment you may get from this film is of the ""so bad it's good variety"".  But, even as far as unintentional humor goes, this film isn't all that inspiring.  The movie, and Ms. Lewis in paticular, grate at the senses and insult the intelligence.  Strongest recommendation to avoid.  One day, mayhaps I'll stop being diplomatic and tell you how I really feel, but until then treat this film like a mugger with ebola and run far far away.",981504000,3,891,4.5886075949367084
196620,5,1578482895,"This was a Great thriller if you don't sit there and nit pick at it. Jane  Emelin (Juliette Lewis)is a very likeable character, as most of Juliette's  portrayals are to me. The movie was very suspensful its anything but dull.  It leaves you with a lot of questions if you don't pay attention to details,  even the smallest. If you do you will see it all comes together at the  end. I also like seeing  Shelly Duvall again as a nosy neighbor named Martha  Stewart(""Not the famous one though."")Theres some really gripping  and comical scenes in this film, some of the best I have seen. Just see it.",961718400,2,596,4.453703703703703
196621,3,1578482895,"Woman ""inherits"" her dead aunt's apartment. She moves in. There are weird neighbors all over the place. Things start happening that freak her out. What you are led to believe about this or that person is not what ends up being reality.

So it had a good premise. I actually think I have seen this movie in another movie before, or two. But while this movie is OK . . . it had a totally weird ridiculous laugh-at-it-out-loud ending/conclusion. I mean they build the suspense up only for you, as a previous movie watcher to be thinking this is going to be one hell of a ending or it is going to be a total let down waste of your time. It was the later. The reason behind all of this was just absurd. But then they left you with a cliff hanger type of deal that kinda followed along teh lines of the beginning part--decent plot. So someone messed up . . . and on the most important part I would say. It also left you with this ""huh?"" feeling. I don't like that. I don't like movies that are not only weird and a farce in underpinning of the movie but muddle it all so badly that you really don't understand what the stupid point was . . . . I mean you get it was stupid. But I guess it was so stupid you didn't even understand it. Whatever.

Also, there is some liberal propagandizing in this movie of course. The main character has this weird habit of standing in her massive apartment's massive window's and watching the neighbors across the way. She laughs off the cross dressing gay couple who sit around smoking pot as if it is ""cute"". It was definitely a liberal manipulation plot point. Gag.

I would skip this.",1410220800,,1615,4.271241830065359

196624,5,1578482895,"I came across this older thriller as I was searching in the movies section and decided to buy it after I saw that it had Juliette Lewis in it and it had pretty good reviews. I thought the movie was actually great. I stayed glued to my seat and watched every minute of it and didn't even take a break. It had me guessing quite a few times and near the end I pretty much had an idea what was going on, but then it seemed it was going to end without showing anything but then I was surprised at the end. Juliette Lewis is a great actress and I have quite a few movies with her in them. Great movie to add to my collection.",1395619200,,619,3.9206349206349205

This movie kept me on the edge of my seat with the little hints that kept me guessing. When you start to figure it out, it's pretty disturbing and I loved how it all tied together in the end. The very ending will freak you out! I'm still thinking about it...something subtle and shocking. I wish they still made movies like this. Highly recommended!!",1389657600,,469,4.529411764705882

I had never heard of this movie, when I came across it, but because of the actors, I decided to view it and was pleasantly surprised. It kept me interested throughout. After seeing it, I knew I wanted to own it for my home movie collection. I couldn't find it anywhere else, so was glad to find it on Amazon.",1366848000,,367,4.183098591549296
196630,4,1578482895,"The is a smart psychological horror thriller. After the death of her aunt, Jane (Juliette Lewis) occupies her 5th floor apartment to the dismay of her weather man boyfriend George (William Hurt). She runs into problems with the 80 year old recluse on the fourth floor who demands silence. The super (Artie Lange)of the building is a bit creepy and is not all there. The landlady (Shelley Duvall) is a bit of a busybody. There is an elderly couple that are a bit blind and deaf. Mr. Collins (Austin Pendleton) is a kindly old man who likes his privacy, but seems to have taken a shine to Jane.

Jane frequently looks out her window at the interesting tenets across the way, who in turn watch their building. Here lives the creepy locksmith, (Tobin Bell) who services both buildings.

Jane gets threatening notes about her noise from the 80 year old woman who lives below her. Then weird things happen which escalate.

The acting was alright, although I would have rather seen Kidman play Jane. The action moves at a smart pace. The plot was good as it gives you subtle clues as to what is happening, but it wasn't too revealing. Well done.

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, no sex or nudity. Fans of this film might like ""Occupant.""",1341964800,3,1222,4.617511520737327
196631,4,1578482895,I loved this movie.  What i liked the most was the ending.  I noticed in the last photograph at the end ... the killer and her boyfriend mirror eachother exactly.  Does this mean they are father and son or is the artist just trying to convey his views on the both of them?,1323216000,,272,4.09433962264151
196632,5,1578482895,"Talk about a chiller, thriller with twists and turns to the very last seconds of the flick!  This one is first class with a pro cast!  Juliette Lewis (always one of my fav's), coupled with William Hurt and Shelley Duvall - not to mention Artie Lange, this one has it all.  I can't begin to venture into the plot.  It unfolds perfectly, and for me to reveal any of it would take away from your viewing pleasure.  Do you like chillers?  Do you like fear?  Do you like bizarre minds that have the potential to turn you crazy?  Then ""The 4th Floor"" is for you!  I was floored (no pun intended).  All 5 stars.  Kudos for director Josh Klausner.",1283472000,2,639,4.285714285714286

He had hoped they would live together across town. Odd events occur almost immediately, as Jane meets her new neighbors, including apartment manager, Martha Stewart (Shelley Duvall from The Shining), a creepy locksmith (Tobin Bell, Jigsaw himself!!), and the nice Mr. Collins (Austin Pendleton from Wishcraft). Jane is besieged by a plague of flies, maggots, and mice! She is threatened by mysterious notes in the hallway, and the never-seen tenant directly beneath her in #4 keeps pounding on the ceiling below, even to the point of destroying Jane's tile floor! Is Jane cracking up, or is there actually an eeevil conspiracy at work? THE 4TH FLOOR is a fun, twisty little tale w/ daft-as-a-brush characters and dark humour throughout.

196634,5,1578482895,"You will never believe it, but the 4th Floor was the first DVD I've ever owned.  In fact, I finally got a DVD player this Christmas (a week ago, in 2006).  Yes, when it comes to ""getting with the times"" you can say I'm pretty slow, but this movie will now go down in history as the first DVD I've ever had, and that alone makes the overall rating jump from a 4 to a 5.

This is the kind of movie that's scary in the Scooby Doo style.  No, I don't mean the Scooby Doo movies with Sarah Michelle Gellar (who's totally hot, by the way) I mean the old cartoon series.  Remember when you had to guess who the bad guy was?  It's like that.

The 4th Floor is about a woman who moves into an apartment building, and to her surprise, the entire building features strange people.  In fact, not a single person in that building is normal.  Out of all these unusual people, only one of them is responsible for messing with the woman who just moved in.  The room below from the woman is how the movie got its name, because that's where the crazy person lives.

Supposedly, this crazy person never comes out of their room.  So when the woman in the floor above has to deal with the many irritating problems from the person below (such as constantly beating on the ceiling) this is when the woman decides she wants to know who lives in the room below, and confront them.  This is where the suspense comes in.

It's almost like a horror plot, but not quite.  It's more along the lines of suspense and mystery.

It's an enjoyable movie, worth watching more than once.",1167696000,7,1550,4.256849315068493
196635,3,1578482895,"Okay except for Juliette Lewis' tendencey to whine.  It was also pretty predictable.  I figured right from the start that her boyfriend (Hurt) was in on it.  He was one screwed up dude, pulling the wool over everybody's eyes.",1155600000,2,225,4.717948717948718

196638,4,1578482895,"I was reminded repeatedly while watching this movie of Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"".  I think both the directing and casting were superb...subtle but effective.

Juliette Lewis is an outstanding actress and deserves much credit for delivering a performance that made you forget that she was acting.

The movie has some great moments and not-so-obvious scenes - although I was able to figure out the ending pretty early on.",1096934400,3,419,5.223880597014926
196639,3,1578482895,"Chilling tale about a woman who moves into an old apartment to live alone and finds that one of her new neighbours has a ""small"" grudge against her and begins tormenting her and eventually tries to kill her. Juliette Lewis does a nice job, and Shelley Duvall steals the show with her over-the-top performance as the apartment house owner, Martha Stewart. Unfortunately, this thriller wasn't as good as I had hoped, although it was quite entertaining and suspenseful. William Hurt's talent goes to waste here, but he does a decent job for what he's given. I liked this alot, but I wouldn't say it's excellent.",1089763200,6,608,4.8
196640,2,1578482895,"If it wasn't for the way it totally fell apart in the end (specifically the last 20 minutes), ""4th Floor"" could've been a cool thriller well in the lines of films that exploit the haunted house theme or that of the psychotic neighbor.
  It's more the psycho-neighbor theme here, but set up in a building that's got ""weird"" written all over it, and actually, except for the character of Juliette Lewis everyone else in her building seems to have gone off to the other side.
  That's what keeps the film interesting and entertaining for the most part: weidos living on its floor, each of them obeying some kind of bizzare ""rules"" and each warning the new tenant to abide by them too ""or else"". All this complete with worms coming out of bathtub holes, mice infesting the new tenant's apartment, threatening notes infront of her door and other oddities.
  Lewis plays the part very convincingly and all that really remains is for the resolution in the end to bring sense to the whole sum, but alas, this doesn't happen.
  The never-to-be-seen psycho from the floor below does appear, but not in a way that makes too much sense really, and even if (out of good will) you'll be willing to overlook that part, the final confrontation between the new tenant and the villain is almost farsical (i laughed through a couple of scenes) spoiling the goods.
  Overall, not one worth shedding money to buy, but probably worth the rental on a rainy winter night....",1085356800,3,1450,4.673228346456693

A beautiful young lady moves into a rent-stabilized apartment in New York, which belonged to her aunt (suspicious death).  The residents are rather strange, there is something ominous in the air.  THen she notices strange things and, probing her independence from a seemingly perfect celebrity boyfriend, perhaps she is a little jumpy.  For a while, she seems like she's getting paranoid, no one else seems to notice anything and her repeated calls to the cops don't help.  Of course, something is going on, etc., etc.  You get the idea.

The cast couldn't be better, I was particularly curious to see Shelley Duvall, who makes only rare appearances.  It goes well until about the middle, then it falls into the silliest tropes and conventions.  It was like the director just got lazy and dusted off some old script.  Completely lost me.  There is not a jot of originality.
