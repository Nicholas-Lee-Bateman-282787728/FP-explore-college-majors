2547754,5,B000F0V0B8,"What can you say? A beautiful golf course, good weather, great competition and a final nine by the best who's ever played the game. There are moments in sports that seem to bring out the pure joy of achievement. Watching Secretariat at Belmont was one such moment. This is another. I plan to watch it the week-end before the Masters each year just to get ready.",1307145600,2,361,4.484848484848484
2547755,5,B000F0V0B8,"The 1986 Masters is arguably one of the greatest major championships ever played. Jack Nicklaus, the greatest golfer of his generation was in the twilight of his career at age 46. No major victories for 6 years, and rare tour victories.  He started the 1986 Masters with 3 mediocre rounds which barely kept him in sight of the leaders.  This video primarily documents the final Sunday round. After a lackluster first eight holes, Jack plays perhaps the greatest ten holes of his life, in a shootout with Ballesteros, Kite, and Norman, with the outcome not decided until the final putt of the day.

I had the privilege of spectating at most of the Masters Tournaments in the 1980s, and the memories of 1986 are spine-tingling. It still is my favorite Masters of all time.  Jack had been the overwhelming crowd favorite every year, but hope for his success seemed to diminish with each passing year leading up to 1986. When Jack made that back nine charge, huge roars would echo across the course. The entire gallery was abuzz- ""What did Jack do?"".  From my vantage point on the edge of the 16th green, the scoreboard behind the 6th hole became my focal point. No radios or mini-TVs are allowed at Augusta. Every Nicklaus birdie posted on the scoreboard generated a larger cheer than birdies by players actually playing the 16th.

This video captures some of the feel of that day. The announcers are obviously caught up in the drama, and can't seem to help but root for Jack. The video captures a gallery that was so exuberant, and world class competitors shaken at Jack's charge (presaging the typical competitor collapse with a Tiger Woods charge).

This feelgood day in golf rivals Tiger's first Masters win, or his 2008 US Open Playoff with Mediate. If you are a golf fan, you need this video.",1253232000,6,1795,4.715654952076678
2547756,5,B000F0V0B8,"I have all of the available Masters DVD's and have enjoyed them all.

This edition is something special.

I think we all know Jack Nicklaus won this one, but the story of how he won, with a staggeringly good last day, makes this DVD compelling viewing. Jack is such a positive golfer, perhaps the greatest ever.

What I liked about Jack was his fairness, his gentlemanly conduct and his courage to make the most demanding shots when it mattered. This DVD shows Jack displaying all these traits; a happy, gracious and awesomely skillful champion.

There is great footage of his competitors; Ballesteros, Kite, Norman and Watson all trying to keep up.

Finally it comes down to a one shot difference.

It is gripping viewing and for me by far the most exciting Masters.

To me this what Golf is all about. A beautiful golf course, perfectly behaved spectators and players, amazing shots, and a close result.

The DVD also contains some nice interviews with Jack and his son Jackie, who was his caddy on this occasion.",1184976000,14,1015,4.7272727272727275
