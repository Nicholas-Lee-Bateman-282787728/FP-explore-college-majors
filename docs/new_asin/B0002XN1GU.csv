8034271,5,B0002XN1GU,"A treat for anyone who loves comedy and remembers Ernie.  He was the most creative man in television to this day.  His antics are timeless and priceless.
Any material with Ernie Kovacs is profound.  Too bad they didn't give him a bigger budget to work with.",1260748800,,257,4.543478260869565
8034272,3,B0002XN1GU,Ernie Kovacs is different and great in what he does.  I grew up watching him and could hardly wait for the next weeks' episode.  The dvd is what you really want if you're a fan of just curious.  This VHS is only a warm-up.  The 3 stars is only because of the VHS format not for the content.,1214179200,,290,3.9482758620689653
8034273,5,B0002XN1GU,"THIS IS AN EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF SHORT SKITS AS PERFORMED BY ERNIE FROM SEVERAL EPISODES OF HIS ""ERNIE KOVACS TV SHOWS"". THEY ARE ALL IN B&W WITH EXCELLENT PICTURE & SOUND QUALITY CONSIDERING THEY WERE ORIGINALLY FILMED IN KENISCOPE, A CRUDE EARLY TYPE OF VIDEO. THIS 80 MIN. VIDEO DETAILS HIS RISE TO FAME AS AN INOVATIVE COMEDIAN UNTIL HIS SUDDEN DEATH IN A CAR ACCIDENT. NOBODY BEFORE OR SINCE HAS EVER DONE COMEDY ON TV LIKE HE DID! MOSTLY SIGHT GAGS WITH UNEXPECTED TWISTS KEPT HIS AUDIENCE HAPPY & CRAVING MORE!!! SIMILAR TO GAGS IN SKITS MADE BY RED SKELETON, BUT WITHOUT THE GOOFYNESS?",1175472000,2,595,4.6761904761904765
