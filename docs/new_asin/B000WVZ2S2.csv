8225830,2,B000WVZ2S2,"All of the footage is streight out of 50's ""FILM"" medium. Nothing has been remastered and there has been no attempt to clean up the original footage in any way. Even the XB-70 material has the Classic ""pink"" coloring from old footage of that era.
All the footage that is there is all ""propaganda"" footage. Listening to the XB-70 naration, you would think that the two aircraft were trouble free and that there were never any problems with the aircraft at all. Not true. The program was filled with many seriouse issues. Another classic example of designs being ahead of the materials and electronic technology base.
Some interesting facts in regards to Wright Patterson and Edwards. Other than that nothing that is really worth the cost of admission.",1357344000,,750,4.8671875
