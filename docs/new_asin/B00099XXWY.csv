2273153,4,B00099XXWY,"I have backpacked many national parks over the last ten years, and my normal routine is to buy a topo and a book to plan my trips, in addition to hitting various web sites.  I backpacked and dayhiked some of the trails mentioned in this DVD about two years ago.  This title was definitely beyond what you get in a book!  In combination with the photos, the narration really gives you extensive detail of the hikes.  I was surprised with how much more info was packed into this DVD than I gleamed from the books.  In fact, I picked up on some things that I missed when I was there in person.

Given what it was designed to do, highlight the trails, it did this task very well.  I would have liked a few more scene selection options, and maybe some more overview maps but all in all I would highly recommend this title to anyone planning a backpack or hiking in Yosemite.",1116028800,,869,4.294478527607362
2273154,5,B00099XXWY,"I am an avid hiker and backpacker and have hiked Yosemite many times over the years however this DVD showed me many things I did not know about Yosemite trails.  I have already planned two new hikes based on what I learned.  The author takes you on a stunning and informative trip on some of Yosemite's best trails.  Not only does he provide beautiful pictures of some of the most beautiful country in the world, but gives you all the background information that everyone else leaves out.  This is truly a one of a kind hiking guide that gives you everything you need to know along with fascinating information on the history, flowers and folklore that I haven't found anywhere else.  He guides you each step of the hike, telling you what to expect, how difficult is it, elevation gain and loss, what the vegetation is like and also gives you VERY important knowledge of tricky trail junctures, campsites and water availability.  This is a must own.  I hope he does some more videos on other areas!  Two thumbs up!!!",1114473600,,1016,4.605555555555555
2273155,5,B00099XXWY,"This DVD is a great resource for both newbies to Yosemite and the seasoned veterans.  The use of the photography that has been captured only sweetens the hearts desire to explore the great park we know as Yosemite.  This DVD is useful to beginners by being a tutorial that unveils the secrets and unlocks the magic of the park.  The narration gives tremendous feedback to the viewer as they ask important questions along their virtual journey (is there adequate water, do I need reservations, when should I plan my trip). I would recommend this DVD to anyone that is planning a trip to Yosemite or fears they will never actually get to visit the park.  Either way the narrator takes you on a front seat journey through all the great day and overnight destinations that Yosemite has to offer.  Each trip is thoroughly covered with maps, visual descriptions, pictures, and verbal narration.  Have fun watching this DVD over and over again and using it as an educational tool.",1114128000,,973,4.761904761904762
2273156,5,B00099XXWY,"This is a wonderful DVD. The scenery and photography are stunning. The narration and music are awesome. I would recommend this DVD for both the newcomer to Yosemite looking for classic trails to introduce them to Yosemite as well as to oldtimers like myself looking for a way to ""hike their favorite trails"" from home!",1113955200,,318,4.8
2273157,5,B00099XXWY,"This is an excellent DVD for those planning a trip to Yosemite, and plan on seeing the sights via day hikes or backpacking trips.

The descriptions are packed with details and pictures to take you on a virtual hiking experience along each trail. Map visuals are shown along with alternative route selections. The narrator offers a variety of information about the spectacular scenery (which is in abundance in Yosemite!) as well as plants and tree varieties. He also points out the best places to refill water supplies so one does not get caught without an adequate supply.

Throw in a few suggestions to help you plan against potential disappointments (making appropriate reservations) and you have a great resource to help you plan an excellent Yosemite experience.

I personally hike Yosemite frequently and will use this as a resource as I continue my exploring of this magnificent National Park!

2273158,5,B00099XXWY,"I've always loved Yosemite, so delving into this DVD was a bittersweet experience--it brought back good memories, which was the ""sweet"" part, but it also made me yearn to be back in that amazing valley and it's indescribably beautiful environs. It is bitter to be here instead of there (""here"" being just about anywhere besides Yosemite).

If this DVD does not make you want to lace up your hiking boots and head for the hills, you're probably completely immune to the exhilirating rush that spending time among the scenic wonders of the world brings to those who are open to such thrilling experiences.

The scenery is magnificent; even seen on a screen rather than in reality, the effect upon the soul is simultaneously invigorating and soothing, like a hot cup of coffee on a crisp morning.

But ""HG-YNP"" is not just comprised of pretty pictures and ""the weather is fine-wish you were here"" postcard scenes. It contains detailed information on several specific hikes: how difficult they are, their duration in both miles and time, when the best time to go is (regarding weather and crowds), etc.

If you're planning a trip to Yosemite, the jewel of the Sierras, this DVD will help you to preapre for your trip in advance so as to make the best use of your time there. It will whet your appetite for the trip and get you primed and ready for your grand adventure.

On the other hand, if you are unable to make it to Yosemite in person just yet, do the next best thing: travel along vicariously with ""The Sierra Nomad"" as he leads you through the wonders of Yosemite, the mountain kingdom non pareil.",1113264000,,1601,4.663120567375887
8058514,3,B00099XXWY,"My biggest beef is probably with Yosemite itself.  The vastness and many trails would make it tough for anyone to cover them in a video.  The descriptions were pretty accurate but truly had to wing it once in the park.  There are some many other trails in the park that I hiked that afterward was surprised they weren't included.  Bought this to try to get an idea of the trails in Yosemite before my first trip there.  It helped, but unfortunately I don't carry a dvd  player with me to reference the trails.  Once again, this is okay in my book and didn't allow the poorly marked trails in the park influence my rating.",1373328000,,621,4.394736842105263
8058515,5,B00099XXWY,"After visiting the Park earlier this year, I enjoyed looking again at the hiking trails.  Some of the background commentary/music doesn't help; a little less human intrusion (and perhaps more birdsongs) would make it better for me.",1289347200,,231,5.243243243243243
8058516,5,B00099XXWY,"This newest edition is such an improvement over the previous one. The filming is superb and includes MUCH better animal life, in quality and quantity (bears, etc.)

Instead of talking about trails in just Yosemite Valley, this new edition also shows other Yosemite ""sections"", Toalume Meadows, Hetch-Hetchie, Mariposa Grove and the road to Glacier Point. Though Yosemite's most well-known trails are in Yosemite Valley, these other ""sections"" have wonderful trails, too. Their coverage makes this new edition more complete.

The Added Material also makes the DVD more complete. These cover proper etiquette around bears, the best time to come to Yosemite, how to get a camping permit, a basic outline of stores, hotels, visitor center, etc.

I have this companies other DVD, (Grand Canyon) too. They seem to come out with a new DVD every 2 - 3 years, and a lot of work obviously goes into them. The narrator clearly has a deep love for Yosemite, and viewing these trails makes you feel like you're hiking them personally with a local.",1271548800,,1034,5.0
8058517,4,B00099XXWY,"I have both the old version and the new. The new one has updated information e.g., regarding the need for a permit to hike Half Dome. The new one also includes Mariposa Grove, Glacier Point and Hetch Hetchy plus more day-hike trails than the old version. The bonus information is good, but I'm sorry to see that the new version eliminates three beautiful backpacker trails found in the old version. Photographically, I don't think the new version is quite as inviting as the old. I also liked the ""real"" maps of the old version vs. the sketched maps of the new one. The new one also doesn't seem to include as much info about wildflowers, etc. The menu background in the new is dull-looking compared to the old which featured colorful plants and chirping bird.  But whether new version or old, this is by far the best (and possibly the only) Yosemite trails dvd on the market. It's a valuable addition and great after-trip souvenir.",1270425600,,932,4.648484848484848
8058518,5,B00099XXWY,"If you plan on visiting Yosemite, this DVD is a must. Very informative on the main sites and trails. Very helpful illustrastions on how to get to the trails. The video on animals and scenery and music that goes with it makes you wish  you were there. Especially like the narration. Have been to Yosemite in the fall, but seeing the waterfalls and streams and rivers on this DVD, can't wait to go in the spring . The DVD covers the basics of Yosemte and I highly recommend it. The Producer of the DVD did a great job in making you feel as if you were walking on the trails with him. Awesome DVD",1270080000,,593,4.201754385964913
8058519,5,B00099XXWY,"This DVD provides a wealth of information for hiking throughout Yosemite National Park. Popular trails in Yosemite Valley, Glacier Point, Toulumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, Wawona and Mariposa Grove are covered--21 day hikes in all. Each hike contains information about the difficulty level, water availability, and restrooms; and usually states the distance and elevation gain.

I viewed the edition released in March 2010. This edition has beautiful video offering panoramic vistas of Yosemite Valley and breathtaking views of most (but not all) of the waterfalls covered in the hikes. Watch the spray accumulate on the camera lens to discover how wet (soaked!) you will get hiking to some of these falls.

""Yosemite National Park (Jon's DVD Hiking Guide)"" will appeal to both novice and seasoned Yosemite hikers. It offers a solid overview for those who have not yet been to Yosemite. The producer/narrator tells us that the Four Mile Trail would be on his list of hikes if it were his first time to visit Yosemite and he could hike only two trails. He does not tell us what the second trail would be but the video itself provides the viewer with plenty of information to make a reasonable assessment about this for him/herself. With 21 day hikes covered, even an experienced Yosemite hiker is likely to find trails that he/she has not yet trekked. This video does an excellent job of showing scenic highlights from the trails so a hiker can know which trails will be of most interest to him/her and frequently shows alternative routes that may be taken for the return portion of the hike.

There are minor ways in which this video could be improved. First, the ""Trail Statistics"" section is hard to find. This section contains the distance and elevation gain for all the hikes and is referred to during one of the hikes in which I am interested. I searched the bonus features for it and, when I could not find it, surmised that it had been left out as a production error. Later, I found that the ""Trail Statistics"" are available only when using the ""Select a Trail"" section of the main menu rather than ""Play All."" Secondly, a first-time visitor to Yosemite may be confused as to the distance between the hiking areas in Yosemite Valley and those located elsewhere in the Park. At the end of the DVD, there is an overview section in the bonus features that provides this information, but I believe it would be more useful to the first-time visitor if it were presented at the beginning of the video rather than the end. As I say, these are minor objections and should not deter anyone from enjoying this largely excellent video.",1269561600,,2629,4.799116997792495
8058520,5,B00099XXWY,"I had hiked in Yosemite some 30 years ago, and this August I am planning a week long trip with my son, to introduce him to the beauty of the Sierras.  The trip will include some day hikes, and one several-day backpacking trip. The goal was to narrow down where to hike. This DVD and the accompanying booklet provided a simple way to decide on the best trips, given a limited amount of time. Actually seeing the vistas and having a detailed narrative provided `virtual tours' that made choosing routes much easier. We decided on the backpacking trip from Tuolumne Meadows to Yosemite Valley via Cathedral Lakes and Cloud's Rest. A nice feature of the DVD is that `side trips' are mentioned in the body of the main description, and by navigating the menu, details of each side trip can be obtained. For example, near the end of the backpacking route, there is an opportunity to branch off and climb Half Dome. Depending on our condition at the end, we may include this extra climb in our itinerary---- the video gives a good feeling for the trail difficulty as well as the visual reward at the top. While a single DVD can't cover all the trails in a park as large as Yosemite, it does an excellent job of detailing the main day-hiking trails most visitors have access to, and outlines a few ideal backpacking routes with outstanding scenery that should work well for the more novice backpacker. The DVD is thoughtfully crafted, and was very useful for planning the trip. In addition, it provides an excellent way to show friends and family where you are planning to go (or where you have been)!",1150761600,2,1592,4.605633802816901
8058521,5,B00099XXWY,"As a native Californian, it's somewhat surprising that I'm still relatively unfamiliar with the trails in Yosemite.  I have visited Yosemite, but I've only completed a handful of the shortest hikes.  I'm planning on spending some time in Yosemite this summer and this DVD and companion booklet is becoming an invaluable aid.

The DVD is arranged by hike and each hike is in a photo slideshow-type format with narration.  I found the pictures beautiful and the narration informative and pleasant.  The DVD provides a wide array of information about the flora, fauna, and landscapes of Yosemite.

I found the Companion Booklet to be a useful addition to the DVD.  It also gives you something to bring along on the trail when the DVD can't be with you.  It's definitely not a replacement for the DVD, but it does provide a quick summary of each trail.

It's easy to see that this DVD and Companion Booklet is made by someone who loves Yosemite and knows it well.  As well as knows what information hikers and backpackers need and want to know.  I'm very much looking forward to future hikes in Yosemite.",1119744000,3,1100,4.7368421052631575
8058522,5,B00099XXWY,"In the credits the creator of this DVD states that he has a ""passion for Yosemite...like home to me"".  This passion and love of Yosemite comes through clearly in this DVD and I recommend it to any serious dayhiker or backpacker who is planning a trip to Yosemite.  There are so many miles of trails in Yosemite that this DVD is by no means comprehensive, but it does feature some of the most scenic and popular trails in the park.  Any first time visitor who wants to do some good hiking should review this DVD before visiting.  For experienced Yosemite hikers many of the trails on this DVD will be 'old news', but even though they are 'old news' to me I still enjoyed it tremendously, even picking up new pieces of information along the way.

As a local resident and regular backpacker, I've hiked 90% of the trails discussed in this DVD.  With a smile on my face I watched the photo slideshows and listened to the author's narration, reliving the many memories I have of each of the trails.  Each trail is presented in a standard format, with an initial description of the route, including distance, elevation gain and loss, trailhead access, and any special permits or arrangements needed (such as shuttle reservations).  The narration then continues over a slideshow of the trail.  I found the information and photos to be very appropriate - they included descriptions of the views, flora, fauna, geologic features, and interesting side trips.  Of great value are the photos of confusing trail junctions, with the narration explaining which way to go.  Also, there are details about water accessibility, outhouse availability, and general amenities that are encountered along the trails.  If only there was a way to bring the DVD along on the trail!

But wait - there is!  The companion book that goes along with the DVD does not contain all the text of the narration, but it includes some of these crucial photos and trail descriptions that makes the DVD so valuable to the first-time Yosemite hiker.

The author is careful to mention when permits and special shuttles are required.  He even points out some illegal campsites along the trail to Cloud's Rest.  For this reason I found it surprising that backcountry bear regulations were not mentioned.  Yosemite has a big problem with bears and hikers have to do their part by storing food properly - it would have been nice to hear this mentioned on the narration over the three backpacking trips featured in the video.

One other thing I would have liked to have heard about is the winter accessibility of the trails featured in the DVD.  This is mentioned briefly in the ""Insider Tips"" section, but it would be nice if something was mentioned about winter use for each trail.  For example, the Mist trail to Vernal Falls is a bad idea in the snow, but the Valley Loop is a lovely cross country ski or snowshoe trip.  And although the author says he loves Yosemite the most in the Spring and Early Summer (a gorgeous time for waterfalls and flowers), I tend to enjoy the quiet and solitude that can only be found in the park in the Winter months.

I'd love to see this DVD become a set - what about one focusing on some of the hikes off of Tioga Road?  For example, North Dome, Lembert Dome, Mount Dana, and Tuolumne Meadows?  And, how about one that focuses on hikes in the Hetch Hetchy region?  I can't get enough hiking in Yosemite!",1119484800,,3393,4.651006711409396
8058523,4,B00099XXWY,"I've been hiking in Yosemite for years and I still found little tidbits of information I was unaware of. Along with basic trail directions, the author injects information on local plant life and geology. I'm very anxious to get out and explore some of the ""new"" destinations that I've learned about in the DVD. An added bonus is the companion guide book. The companion guide book would make a handy carry-along when out on the trail.

It did take me a little time to get used to the DVD navigation, but I'm kind of new to the DVD technology. Another thing I would have liked to see was more featured trails! I can never get enough of Yosemite!",1119398400,3,643,4.4491525423728815
