8242798,5,B0011WGO9W,I bought this years ago at a Hot Topic store. I love Foamy!,1427241600,,59,3.6153846153846154
8242799,5,B0011WGO9W,"I enjoy the subtextual elements to Neurotically Your's. Making either overt or covert statements on the world we live in and doing it with exaggerated, off color humor is always a bonus. Strong language that doesn't apologize, character development slowly but surely as things move onward in the series keep things engaging. Foamy's wrath both hilarious yet something we can all identify with. To say ""it's just a cartoon"" trivializes the actual harder content that does make it into this series. It is just a cartoon, but it also has meaning. One needs to pay attention and think. While I do not agree with every single opinion in the series, it still can offer opposing viewpoints. It is a laugh out loud piece of independent art that is done by just one guy (seriously, read the credits, you'll see it...same name over and over aside Germaine's). Germaine is a complex character to follow. She may not seem it, but she is steeped in social commentary and personal identity crisis. Engrossing and entertaining.",1391212800,,1012,4.8895348837209305
8242800,5,B0011WGO9W,"The first season is great, Foamie is fresh and insightful, Germain is still a poet and the seamy underbelly of the city and its later exploitation and degradation is merely glimpsed. We begin to laugh along with these characters and to love them a little. >)",1379376000,,258,4.630434782608695
8242801,5,B0011WGO9W,"Foamy makes learning fun, lol.  I love watching Foamy. He's the most informative squirrel who is always so pissed off.",1338076800,2,118,4.9
8242802,5,B0011WGO9W,"The guy isn't the best artist in the world, but as far as entertainment goes I find Foamy to be very humorous. He makes good points in his rants and the fun is always there. It's not for someone who can't take a joke, and it's definitely not for someone who takes everything absolutely, to the letter, seriously. If you want serious and in depth without anything entertaining in it, I suggest you take yourself somewhere else.

Obey the Lord and Master Foamy! <3 Squirrel Wrath and all.",1269734400,3,486,4.5227272727272725
8242803,1,B0011WGO9W,"You can watch a few of these and get the general tone of anger and putdowns and unsophisticated nihilistic attitude. I've encountered this kind of view in Ambrose Bierce and Mark Twain, but here, there's no let up and the interest invested (and time) seems wasted. There's nothing here to capture your interest to go further.

If you're goth enough, you probably will find these gloomy bits of interest. The animation is decent, but the substance is weak.",1254960000,3,455,4.833333333333333
