My mother was called ""Blanche"" her whole life and nobody remembered her real name. After her divorce, she needed her birth certificate to gain employment. The unresolved search forced to get birth certificate through 'affidavit'. My great-aunt refused to sign it, because she said, ""Blanche was NOT her real name and she wasn't born on Jan 2nd.""

Two years went by and my mother received an envelope from Clark County, IL, Recorder. She was nervous and asked me to open it. Sure enough, her 'real' birth certificate revealed that her name was ""Bertha"" and she was born on Jan 3rd, 1918.

So thanks to Blanche Sweet, my mother died as ""Blanche"".

BTW: Blanche Sweet was a good actress and 'Judith of Bethulia' is a good film.",1387756800,,853,4.828767123287672
8274133,3,6302420288,"A friend lent me this movie and I must admit, I was not familiar with the story.  I understand that it is from the Apocrypha with which I am not familiar.  Fortunately, the VHS I got had some background information on the movie.

The plot is that an Assyrian army lays siege to a Jewish village.  As the townspeople suffer from want, a woman, by the name of Judith, has a vision in which she will be able to save her people.  It involves romancing the prince of the invaders.  Enough said.

One of the challenges of silent movies is the distractions that the written dialogue cards have on the flow of the movie.  Thus it was important to emote, on the silent screen, as much as possible to communicate as much as possible.  I thought that the actors did a fair job of this.  I especially liked the drunken prince although the dialogue cards let us know what was going to happen.  I did have a problem with the ineptness of the siege.  At one point, the army of the good guys venture out in search of water.  They get a fair amunt done before being repelled.  I though the costumes were more than adequately done.  The picture I saw was a bit scratchy but certainly quite viewable.  I doubt I'll see this one again but I may look it up in the Aprocrypha.",1141516800,,1254,4.272340425531915
