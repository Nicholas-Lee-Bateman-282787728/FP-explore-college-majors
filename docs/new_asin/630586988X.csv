1098332,5,630586988X,"This movie follows the classic line of Zorro with a twist,The only thing I can say is you have to watch it,The detail is very well done and the humor is great!",1245196800,,159,4.0
1098333,1,630586988X,"I purchased this DVD because I am building my Zorro collection. However, the sound quality is equivalent to an amateur learning the basics. The actors/actresses are of the wrong cultural background. Really, blondes talking with a Mexican ""accent"". Too stereotypical. There is no acting whatsoever, just a bunch of ""gringos"" dressed in the old California style moving in front of the camera. This movie is far worse than a ""B"" production. If you are a teenager who has never seen a naked woman, you might get something out of this fiasco production. As for me, I would not spend more than $2.50 on this DVD. I got totally burned.",1127088000,5,628,4.770642201834862
1098334,4,630586988X,"I saw this many years ago and it is still enjoyable. The way it is done, leaves something for the imagination. This is not as graphic as the films that are out now.",1124582400,2,164,4.0

Plot:

 Los Angeles under Spanish control (the opening shows present day Los Angeles, narrator: ""home of 7 million people, about half of them are women, the rest are men,"" then a shot of the first street in Los Angeles, then Los Angeles under Spanish control 150 years ago).  The head of the local government, Luis Bonassario, is corrupt and abusive (when one of the ""little people"" protests, pulls a knife, and is killed,  his daughters must pay the father's taxes by ""working it off"" by being raped, kept as slaves, forced to play with snakes, along with other things).  Some of the aristocrats dislike this state of affairs and one of them send for their son, Don Diego de Vega.  The son has been off at a military academy in Madrid, Spain.  Some scenes in Madrid (bar, dancing flashing woman, upstairs benches for the guests to enjoy, duel).  Then the son arrives home.  He pays a visit on the local corrupt government officers and acts quite gay, and much more concerned about fashion than justice or women.  Of course, he helps the poor unfortunates under the disguise of Zorro (and in the process meets up with the Luis' niece and wife, separately, though the two women have a nice scene together).

Review:

 The movie is somewhat similar to the 1981 PG rated George Hamilton ""Zorro, the Gay Blade.""  The movie has its funny moments (maybe more because I didn't expect those moments to occur), and it is a cut above the thin to no plot adult movies of today (of course, it's the mainstream film world that would make a film like this today see: ""Boogie Nights,"" ""Showgirls,"" etc.).  Compared to adult movies of today, this is a great film.  Compared to mainstream films, well, some of the acting isn't really that great (though some of the acting seems to be good enough), and there are several plot holes, but it still could probably compare well to movies of today. At least to movies like ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Showgirls."" The film has many scenes of action, nudity, and bits of comedy.",1115251200,15,3642,4.985123966942148
1098336,3,630586988X,"When I watched this one, I was reminded of the cheesy comedy of Flesh Gordon...there's all the token nudity and sexual situations...watching white people try spanish accents is pretty entertaining as well. Don't be  looking for fabulous effects on this one, it's just a funny little movie,  cheesy humour, erotica, might remind you of zorro the gay blade, just with  nudity...",963705600,14,376,5.131147540983607
7898446,5,630586988X,"Had a copy before, very funny spoof with some serious overtones. One has to understand this was filmed in the early '70s, long before digital recording came along.",1512345600,,163,4.857142857142857
7898447,4,630586988X,"Zorro is a masked swordsman trying to save sex-slave women.  Officials in Spain aim to collect tax.  They kill  farmers and hold their  females for sexual advances.  Zorro also gets his share during this adventure.  All sex scenes are stimulating and unreal.  Swordsmanship does not exist.
So to speak, Zorro is a hero.  He is the winner.",1478131200,,338,4.807017543859649
7898448,5,630586988X,"Saw this ""adult"" movie when it first came out in 1971-72 and decided to get it for my ""classics"" video collection.  One of the funniest, best written ""adult"" films of all time, IMHO.  A well-done spoof, but still an ""adult / erotic"" film.",1458604800,,238,4.511627906976744
7898449,2,630586988X,"The trailer for this R rated comedy-adventure makes it look pretty entertaining, which is what trailers are supposed to do. There are a lot of decent females displaying full frontal nudity (and some males too, in brief scenes). The writing and direction is completely wrong. In fact, the script is absolutely horrible. The acting and sets are pretty good for the obviously low budget. This could have been a minor classic howler with more talented people at the helm. My buddies and I watched it with some drinks and pretty much lost interest after the first 45 minutes. Unfortunate misfire. Don't pay too much if you want to add this to your DVD cheese collection",1440806400,,664,4.782608695652174

Made from old Art Theatre movies from the fifties through ""Seventies By Something Weird Videos"" They were the
X rated movies from the past. Today many would be unrated or rated Hard R , Some of the later ones would still rate an X rating.
The reproduction of this particular movie ""The Erotic Adventures of Zorro"" is pretty good considering being duplicated from
