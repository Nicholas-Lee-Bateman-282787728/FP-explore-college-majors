8572799,4,B00BQRBCSA,"I liked the film in spite of it falling short in a number of areas. This is a campy spoof of camp slasher films. A group of young adults attend work retreat camp, Yurulgundie. They compete with each other to become ""team leader"" a title some covert more than others. All of the participants are creative characters which is perhaps the main reason to watch the film.  The camp participants place a suggestion in a hat and then they are read. One claims: ""I am going to kill each and every one of you creatively."" Shorty afterwords, they start getting killed, in ways that might give you a flashback to the superior film ""Student Bodies.""

The dialogue was witty. The camp humor was good also. The problem was that the end just dragged on. Likewise when they developed a funny gag they played it to too long like the door shadow scene.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Fake male frontal nudity. Male butt nudity.  3 1/2 stars

8572800,3,B00BQRBCSA,"Extremely silly Australian slasher comedy about a busload of new hires driven out to a remote woodland area for a company retreat to figure out who has the natural leadership skills to be team leader.  But someone is killing the new hires off one by one in gruesome and sometimes amusing ways.  It doesn't really make much sense that the characters are all roughly the same age and embody high school movie stereotypes (cheerleader, jock, goth girl, tomboyish female who secretly pines for her male best friend, etc).  I suppose if you want to give writer/director/star Joe Bauer the benefit of the doubt maybe he's saying the corporate world is like high school all over again--or maybe it doesn't really matter since the humor in The Killage is rarely more sophisticated than a Three Stooges short.

The Killage can be frustratingly hit or miss but it's agreeably silly and every once in a while unexpectedly comes up with a gag that is belly laugh funny.  On a slasher comedy scale The Killage is much more amusing than any of the Scary Movie films or Club Dread but not as consistently funny as Tucker and Dale Vs Evil or as clever as Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon or Detention.  The Killage is slightly funnier than Severance, which had a similar corporate retreat set-up but The Killage is much broader and goofier where Severance aspired to being a smart satire but never quite got there.  If you like slasher comedies The Killage is probably a must-see but be prepared for some lame gags between the funny ones.",1434758400,,1532,4.6940298507462686
