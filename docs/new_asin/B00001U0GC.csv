1246349,3,B00001U0GC,"Although a bit dry and strangely dispassionate, especially by today's standards, ""Transatlantic Tunnel"" is worth a viewing for sci-fi buffs.
The film starts out well enough, with some millionaires sitting around listening to a private symphony. The only real humor in the entire film happens here, where there is an exchange between one of the group and his wife: ""Doesn't this song ever end?"" To which she replies, ""It's Beethoven... he's dead."" ""Good!"" says the millionaire.
The group is at the home of a wheelchair-bound visionary, named Lloyd (C. Aubrey Smith), for the purpose of undertaking the greatest engineering feat of all time; the construction of an underground tunnel between Britain and America. The reasoning for building the tunnel is pretty weak, and the excuse of a tense political state between the US and England is laughable.
Regardless of common sense, construction is approved, and work begins from both the US side and the British side. As work speeds along (thanks to the invention of a ""radium drill,""), the plot sinks into a mire of melodrama. The architect and hero of the story is Richard 'Mack' McAllan. His wife is jealous of the tunnel, as it keeps her obsessed husband from staying by her side. His best friend (played by Leslie Banks), who also works on the tunnel, spends more time with the wife than the husband. Any interesting plot twist that could come from this triangle (such as an adulterous affair), is glossed over and avoided. An interesting subplot, in which an arms dealer tries to take control of the corporation charged with building and running the tunnel is never resolved. There are also romantic complications with Lloyd's beautiful daughter that evaporate well before the film ends (I have Timeless Video's release, which clocks in at 71 minutes, while the original film is reportedly 94 minutes).
Along the way, there are threats of a debilitating poisoned gas which causes ""tunnel sickness"", and a volcanic explosion that kills hundreds of workers (including Mack's son).
This is an excellent example of Depression Era futurism. Like ""Things to Come"", this film shows that mankind can achieve greatness through science if we all work together towards a common goal, forsaking the dangers and tragedies that may be unleashed. The thinking of the day that the wealth and vision of the rich, combined with the genius of those in industry, will somehow save the world from itself is somewhat quaint.
The film has some good special effects, but I wouldn't say they were necessarily groundbreaking. The travel cars are interesting, as are the hospital transports and futuristic motorcars and airplanes. A precourser of the big screen in Times Square shows mass-communication via video and loudspeaker (although the announcer looks more like a scary, Orwellian authority figure than a friendly source of information). That and the early use of TV and 2-way TV communication set the film apart.
As for the print, it was pretty muddy and transferred in EP mode, but more or less watchable. I would have preferred a sharper image to better see the models of the radium drill. Also, about half-way through the Timeless Video version, there is a messy reel switch complete with countdown leader.",1018742400,10,3240,5.057943925233645
1246350,3,B00001U0GC,"Not bad for the time in which it was meant for. Details the building of a tunnel from NY to the western side of Europe. Meant for cars to travel. Hero designs the tunnel. Both US and Europe begin digging. Hero's son joins the digging team but dies as he gets caught in volcanic steam as they dig near a volcano. Both sides eventually join each other.
Even though it was B&W and faded a little, it was still watchable. Shows visionary futuristic devices (i.e. personal phone calling with TV on both ends so you can see who is calling.",975628800,3,533,4.34

7914788,2,B00001U0GC,"Gaumont's ambitious ""Transatlantic Tunnel"" (1935) is weighed down by a  melodramatic script and dull acting  the Walter Huston and George Arliss cameos notwithstanding. Impressive visual effects and Ern Metzner's futuristic art direction are the real stars in this disappointing remake of 1933's ""Der Tunnel."" Judicious editing might have alleviated the overall tedium.",1384905600,2,369,6.076923076923077
7914789,3,B00001U0GC,"Although its star is Richard Dix, once an immensely popular cowboy hero, ""Transatlantic Tunnel"" (1935)is most notable for three elements:  its ""Things to Come"" futurism, the very deliberate ""hands across the sea"" political subtext of the lead-up to WWII, and one of the last appearances of the great British stage and screen actor, George Arliss (1867-1946).  The futuristic sets are very Bauhaus, modernist and simple, and impart the feeling of a very solid world in which Britain and America would clearly guide man's destiny in a positive direction.  The tunnel-drilling machine (called the ""Radium Drill"") exactly prefigures the machine which finally frilled ""The Chunnel"" between England and France, including the principle of starting from both shores and meeting in the middle.  Its depiction is pretty impressive for the technology of the times.  As the British Prime Minister, George Arliss embodies the spirit Anglo-American cooperation, in a three-piece suit with watch-and-chain.  He is determined and sincere, and his two static speeches in the House of Commons were inspirational and optimistic, delivered when they were.  ""Transatlantic Tunnel"" is not great film-making, or even high melodrama.  It is, however, a wonderful little time capsule, and worth the price of the purchase.",1301961600,,1296,5.51010101010101
7914790,3,B00001U0GC,"There are two themes that run through this unusual film that are worth a mention.  The film's vision of the future of labour and work place relations describes the plight of the working man as an expendable tool of civilisation, revealing much about the expectations of the day.  Views on women's suffrage are also discussed.  They had it tough in them days!  The other, far more subtle and profound for it, is the love triangle.  Hollywood has always been a gay town, and I don't mean they smile a lot.  The love triangle between the Chief Engineer, his neglected wife and his best friend is a classic example of Hollywood sneaking past the censors; the best friend is gay and is in love with his boss.  That's why he never 'makes a pass'.  This adds a dimension and depth to the film over-all as, when the character is viewed in that context, what appears to be a science fiction film becomes a cunning gay drama.

Enjoy this one; there's more to it than initially meets the eye. It's worth a look, either way you look at it.",1153699200,3,1027,4.449197860962567
7914791,3,B00001U0GC,"Set in the future, this little 1935 Gaumont film is cast with four American actors: Richard Dix, Madge Evans, Walter Huston and Helen Vinson. The plot deals with an undersea tunnel  being contructed beneath the Atlantic Ocean which would connect England and the United States.  Despite the fact that the film was made 67 years ago, the special effects lend credibility to the effort, showing how air locks are shut down during a disaster, and how people could be trapped inside forever and other troubles faced during construction.  The process is actually shown to the public via television and some of the more disasterous scenes are starkly realistic. Dix is the designer of the tunnel who keeps in contact with his family only through telephone or television: this picture was years ahead of its time, as it conveys some very real touches.  Very surprising is the sight of Walter Huston playing the role of the U.S. President.  Huston was in England to to another film at the time and was kept waiting while the production was delayed - he accepted this role in order to fill time.  The great George Arliss is seen as the Prime Minister of England.  A very interesting vintage Sci-Fi film any which way you look at it.",1036972800,7,1222,4.735849056603773
