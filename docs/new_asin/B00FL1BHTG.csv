5998413,5,B00FL1BHTG,"""Watchtower"" is not a movie for the impatient or faint of heart. Its pacing is deliberate and its central narrative is an extremely mature theme. But if you are looking for a respite from the predictable formulas of Hollywood offerings, and if you can get your payoff from spectacular cinematography and patient, non-judgmental looks at characters in crisis, you will find this movie richly rewarding.

I am going light on plot details here: too many will spoil what unfolds in this movie. Set in the alpine region of north-central Turkey, ""Watchtower"" follows the paths of two people. The man (Nihat) has taken a job at fire observation tower. Although some ""guards"" (as they call themselves) break up their solitary existence with visits from family, many --including Nihat-- spend their time in their cabins by themselves. Nihat is there alone by choice, following a recent personal tragedy. His interaction with his peers is by radio, and key plot features are indeed revealed during some of these radio communications. Down the mountain at a rural. The film's co-protagonist is a young woman (Seher) who works downhill from Nihat's mountain. She has recently left her university studies, and is living an ascetic life of her own. She works for a small bus service (first as an onboard attendant, later cooking at the small mountain bus station where she also lives).

What follows their meeting is a superb examination of two people in crisis. They are both forced to face the results of their past actions (and the actions of others) as they deal with the fallout today and consider their futures. Pay close attention to the themes of loneliness and isolation, even as unfolding events force these two together.

Invest the 100 minutes it takes to watch this tale unfold; you won't be disappointed.

This movie is unrated, but would almost certainly be pinned with ""R"" if it were. The plot themes are extremely adult, and occasionally, so is some of the language. There is brief partial nudity, but it is not gratuitous and is essential to advancing the story.

The DVD also contains a short film. Ironically, the full-length Turkish drama is accompanied by a lighthearted Greek tale of a small seaside village plotting to add a new resident to avoid loss of government services. Charming on its own, it will be appreciated an extra measure by those who have spent time in Greece (or with Greeks anyplace).

This is an offering from the Film Movement series; Film Movement provided a copy for review purposes.",1393804800,2,2515,4.933806146572104
5998414,5,B00FL1BHTG,"Watchtower from Turkish director Pelin Esmer. As with all Film Movement releases, it is an official selection or winner at multiple film festivals.

 Nihat has taken a job as a fire warden, scanning the forest from an isolated tower high in the mountains. From the opening scenes, with his walk, his facial expressions and more, he telegraphs a sadness, a loss. The viewer senses that he wants to be alone, that this isolated job will let him escape somehow.

 Seher is a young woman who has taken a job as a bus hostess and is living in a small room at the rest stop. Her loneliness is also telegraphed with few words. She looks through pictures, picks up the phone to call someone, leaving only a vague message. Again, the viewer just knows that there is more to her story - that the bus stop is for her an escape as well.

 Nihat comes down the mountain for supplies and stops for tea at the restaurant. It is inevitable that the two meet. Each is indeed hiding something and their lives reluctantly become intertwined. We discover the reason each has retreated from life and watch as their lives are inexorably drawn together.

 There is little dialogue in Watchtower, rather it's the silence that speaks volumes, underlining the theme of isolation. The use of walkie talkies by the fire wardens was an effective device to underscore Nihat's isolation and the need to connect, to unburden, to share and to be part of a society.

 The background of the film is spectacular. The views from the watchtower are breath taking. I wonder if the house used was an actual warden station or if it was built for the film? I quite liked it and pictured myself living at the top of the mountain!

 I watched the ending more that once, deciding if it was what I wanted. And it was. This is one of my favourite films so far, one I would easily recommend. 2012 / Turkish with English subtitles / 100 min

 As always, there's a short film included as a bonus. This time it's a 17 minute film from Greece called The Foreigner. A small village needs to up their population in order to keep receiving services from the state. When a tourist wanders into town, they try to convince him to stay. This short was excellent! A full story played out in very short time, with a fun plot, an excellent lead and beautiful scenery as well. ( I think I could live here as well!)",1392940800,2,2351,4.475409836065574
5998415,5,B00FL1BHTG,"Turkish writer director Pelin Esmer as won many awards for this compelling film that deals with the results of trauma on the psyches and souls of two people whose lives have been jolted by trauma. With a very small cast, minimal dialogue from the two main characters, and a supporting ensemble offering realistic interpretations of the people outside the lives of the main characters, coupled with stunning photography of the Mountains of Turkey, this film leaves an indelible mark on the viewer.

In contemporary Turkey we meet Nihat (Olgun Simsek), a quiet man suffering form the accidental loss of his wife and child in an accident in which he was the sole survivor. He exits the mainstream by becoming an isolated lookout fireguard in a watchtower in the mountains of Turkey. We also meet a beautiful but troubled young Seher (Nilay Erdonmez) who is in college but has taken on a job as a tour bus hostess, living in a crude bus station belonging to her uncle. We gradually learn that she is pregnant (morning sickness and enlarging girth), a fact she finally confesses to her poor but proud mother (Lain Ceylan) and father (Riza Akin) who are shocked by her deed. Seher distances herself further and eventually gives unattended birth to the child that resulted from a rape by her uncle. Seher cannot accept her fate, hides the newborn boy in the trash bin and sets out on foot to separate herself from everyone. Nihat, whom Seher has met while waitressing in the bus station, rescues her, takes her and the baby he has discovered to his tower where he nurtures them, encouraging Seher to breastfeed her own child. The interpersonal relationship between these two deeply bruised people and how they cope concludes this deeply moving film.

In the hands of less talented actors this story would not gel, but the director and his gifted actors create a memorable, important film. In Turkish with English subtitles. Anther remarkable addition to the library of FilmMovement. Grady Harp, February 14",1392940800,3,1999,4.893805309734513
5998416,5,B00FL1BHTG,"This Turkish film with English subtitles is the story of two damaged people who at first seek isolation, are antagonistic when they are first thrown together, and then finally discover a measure of solace in each other's company.  Nihat is a loner, a man trying to escape from bad memories, who takes a job as a look out in a watch tower deep in mountainous forest land.  Seher is a young woman who has suffered violent trauma.  She becomes an attendant on a bus traveling through the same forest lands, and eventually she and Nihat meet.

This is a quiet film in which much depends on the viewer's own careful observations and analyses of the characters.  In some ways watching it is like reading a long and complex book in which the story unfolds slowly.  The scenery is beautiful and was quite surprising to me, since I had very little idea about Turkish geography.

The Watchtower is not an easy film to watch and it demands your full attention to fully comprehend it, but it is certainly worthwhile.",1391212800,,1004,4.606741573033708
5998417,5,B00FL1BHTG,"Beautifully filmed in the mountains of rural Turkey, Watchtower is the kind of film that relies mostly on its subtle character development then its storyline. Nihat is a man who is escaping from life after a serious tragedy. He finds a job as a warden in a mountain top watchtower. His life is simple and isolated. Seher is an ex-college student who has experienced a traumatic event and is still in the process of dealing with it in secrecy. She finds a job as a hostess at a bus station near Nihats watchtower.

As the story unfolds with each character, there is a point of intersection where Nihat has to intervene with Seher. What follows is a series of events and twists that find both characters questioning themselves and each other in respectful, surprising and honorable ways. Its a story of morality, isolation and forgiveness. The ending is perfect.

To give any more detail would be a great disservice to this film. The photography is amazing and the actors are quietly intense. Full of symbolism, nuance and brilliant direction, this is the kind of film youll want to watch more than once.",1390694400,6,1102,4.734375
5998418,4,B00FL1BHTG,"Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of the Film Movement library of foreign and indie movies, and that I am a member of their DVD-of-the-month club. This is the October, 2013 release in that on-going series.

""Watchtower"" (2012 release from Turkey; 96 min.) brings the story of two people whose paths eventually cross. We meet Nihat, a middle-aged man who as the film opens we see starting a new job as a forest fire guard in a watchtower near Tosya, a remote area of Turkey. We also get to know Seher, a young woman who has taken a job as a bus hostess for a regional bus company in Tosya. We learn that she recently left another city in Turkey, Bolu, without telling her parents, and is more or less in hiding in Tosya. It isn't much longer before it is revealed that Seher is pregnant, the reason she fled from her parents. Why is she hiding her pregnancy from her parents? Who is the father of the unborn baby? How will Nihat's and Seher's paths cross? To tell you more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, I purposefully didn't know much of this movie when I viewed it, and I was surprised (in the best of ways) to find (and also reason that I've kept my plot introduction to a minimum) that this is a complex and gripping family drama and relationship drama. The life circumstances of both the forest fire guard and the young woman will surely tug at your heart. (As to the fire guard, apparently Turkey uses them to monitor possible forest fires in remote areas.) Second, the movie's photography is nothing short of outstanding. Check out the 360 degree views from atop of the watchtower across the Tosya area, it looks like a postcard and make you want to go visit the area yourself. Last but certainly not least, the acting performances of the two leads will leave a deep impression on you, in particular the woman playing the role of Seher.

As is usually the case, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and this month we get a 17 min. shortie from Greece called ""The Foreigner"", in which a small village tries to convince a foreign tourist to remain permanently. Pretty good too, in fact. It just adds to the viewing experience that is ""Watchtower"". ""Watchtower"" is a great addition to the ever-growing and rich Film Movement catalog of foreign and indie movie. Bottom line: ""Watchtower"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1383004800,2,2442,4.532879818594104

5998425,5,B00FL1BHTG,"Pelin Esmer`s study of stifled human anguish, The Watchtower, is a gem.  A low-budget film from Turkey with actors unfortunately unknown to the wider world, The Watchtower deserves an audience among film connoisseurs.

The story is deceptively simple and so real that you`ll forget it`s a movie.  Esmer `s intimate camera work combined with the overall quietude of the film gives it a rare intensity.  The film has been called `a study in solitude, ` but it is much more. It tells something fundamental about the human condition.  It shows how we can`t heal our wounds alone.

The setting itself is breathtaking.  Filmed high up in the densely-pined mountains of Anatolia, the natural backdrop intensifies the subtle drama that ensues between the two protagonists.  Nihat arrives to his new job as fire-watcher.  With his somber, brooding sadness, his hidden pain becomes evident.  A deep fissure lies somewhere in Nihat`s spirit and he has come to the mountain to hide, heal and perhaps find life again.  Seher too exudes a quiet sorrow beneath her dark-haired beauty.  As a bus hostess, she serves the passengers with robotic efficiency.  She too carries a burden within.

Nihat`s contemplative and uneasy solitude is artfully captured in the shots of his austere existence.  He spends his days chopping wood, scanning the horizons and his nights reluctantly communicating with the other watchers.

It is Seher who unfolds first.  Like a slumbering volcano ready to explode, Seher`s situation begins to affect the world around her, her family, her job.  Seher`s character shows the crushing limits often inflicted upon women, especially in a patriarchal society like that of Turkey.

A rash act of desperation by Seher brings her and NIhat together.  Both have to sacrifice some of their self-imposed isolation in the interests of something greater.  They soon break their silence, learning the secrets of the other.  Their common humanity becomes exposed as they struggle to go forward, together.

The film`s majesty lies in its silence and grace.  Nihat breaks his silence only rarely.  Seher`s loneliness is exacerbated by the official chatter that drones around her.  Esmer excels with her camera work.  Long camera shots from the tower and lingering close-ups help express the characters` pain.

As Seher, Nilay Erdonmez is wonderful as she attempts to keep a lid on her smoldering emotions.  She spans the gamut from instant rage, teary despair and most of all, a tired ennui with her horizon-less life.  Likewise, Olgun Simsek as Nihat is mesmerizing as a man paralyzed by unresolved guilt and grief.

The Watchtower boils with a serious mishmash of emotional conflict.  One must pay close attention and let the film hypnotize.  There is nothing artificial here, nothing overly-dramatized.  Rather, Esmer has captured a very human story here.  The film deepens with each viewing, especially for those who can connect with its themes.  The Watchtower  is a must-see for those who enjoy serious, emotionally-fulfilling films.",1458172800,,3032,5.202898550724638

5998435,5,B00FL1BHTG,"Watchtower is such superior film-making and acting on so many levels. . .but stop reading here unless you don't mind spoilers which are impossible not to write in a review:

1--The screenwriting is so superior at developing the two characters as foils to each other:  he guilty for accidentally killing his child, she guilty for birthing her incest baby; he being more maternally instinctive about her baby's care (bathing child, making swinging baby hammock), she being indifferently aggressive toward her baby (abandons newborn at roadside, resists breastfeeding as child cries with hunger).

2--The high mountainous beauty of Turkey was an eye-opener for me since mainstream American films virtually ignore the country, especially now as the USA is in perpetual Middle Eastern wars.

3--The acting was so realistic that watching felt more like eavesdropping than being entertained:  her self-delivery of her baby, his poignant telling how he caused the accident that killed is wife/child, their climatic arguments about why he saved her abandoned baby, and even the infant(s) were amazing during the cooing, quiet scenes after her breastfeeding or during the baby's bath.

4--I even marveled at their clever way of holding an infant by his belly, face down so rinsing water won't get into his eyes. . .a bathing tip never shown in my culture as I raised my kids.

5--Finally, this film kept me on pins and needles for several scenes: knowing she left the baby at the roadside until he rushed back to bring him to the watchtower, fearing the first nights when he left the baby with her that she might still harm him by the open fireplace or throwing him from the watchtower slopes. . .yikes, I totally anguished as that baby cried.

Needless to say, I needed the peaceful final scene . . .kinda like a ""they-lived-happily-ever-after"" finale.

This film is a keeper, thanks to Amazon prime or I would have never seen it.",1434240000,10,1921,4.996865203761756
5998436,5,B00FL1BHTG,This is a very well-developed plot of a story about too lonely and troubled souls. Nihat's calm quietness really appealed to me and spoke volumes to the heart of the man. Seher is in a society where women are not always cherished. She endures the trauma of being vulnerable and helpless in a place where there's not much she can do to help her plight. Bravo for a heartfelt story! I was thoroughly captivated from start to finish.,1431820800,,430,4.5256410256410255
5998437,5,B00FL1BHTG,"Solitude can come in many forms. This movie defines it as solitude. But not always because you aren't around others. One man, in charge of a watchtower and one woman, living alone in an apartment and giving guided bus tours. Both lives are in turmoil.

The solitude of Nihat is almost unbearable. The occasional radio check in to ensure that all is good at his post and a bus ride into town to get supplies are his connections to the world. But he has his own history to deal with as well and perhaps his isolation is a self imposed sentence.

Seher is struggling with her own issues and family dynamics and eventually, these two lost souls come together (and not romantically). They save each other in a way and the humanity of their contact is comforting.

This is not a fast-paced, adrenaline filled thriller but a gentle and quiet look at the simplicity of these lives and the complexity of their problems. Worth a watch.",1406505600,5,925,4.5602409638554215

Its landscapes are visually inspiring.  The setting is prominent--  a solitary small piece of civilization, tucked in the exquisite verdant forrests that blanket the mountains of the Black Sea region of Turkey.  The skies are a heavenly blue and the diaphanous mist swirls about, adding a bit of frill to the rugged mountains and its handful of time-worn buildings. Seher (Nilay Erdonmez) was, till now, a college student, who's had to flee to this isolated place, where she lives in a substandard room in a bus terminal, and works as a bus ""hostess."" Nihat (Olgun Simsek) was a carpenter, now secreted away  in a cabin on a mountain top, working as a forrest fire warden. Their paths intersect, and the outcome remains to be seen. The acting is solid. The flat affect of the 2 main characters reflects their woundedness. We do start to see a few green shoots along the way, as snippets of their humanity and pathos are revived.
