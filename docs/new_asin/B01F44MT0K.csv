8760043,5,B01F44MT0K,"I'm sort of astounded that there aren't any other reviews for this movie. This is some hilariously MST3K caliber stuff, and deserves to be seen by all fans of so-bad-its'-good cinema. Zima plays a woman implied to be bipolar, but who is clearly just bonkers. After her latest boyfriend dumps her in the most gentle breakup in the history of breakups, she destroys his entire house and vandalizes his car before hooking up with the sweet but clueless heir to a marketing empire. Their relationship is actually going pretty well until Zima's off-the-wall behavior threatens to ruin everything. I don't want to spoil anything, but to whet your appetite, the movie branches off into a variety of ""The Room"" worthy subplots that run the gamut from sexual blackmail to prostitution to extortion to murder coverups. It's simply got to be seen to be believed. Buy it now!",1483056000,,863,4.877551020408164
