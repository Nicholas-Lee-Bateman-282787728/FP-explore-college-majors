8363614,4,B002C8YRZC,"In GHOST IMAGE, a woman (Elisabeth Rohm) loses her boyfriend in an automobile ""accident"". She begins to see her dearly departed in their last party video, and he talks directly to her! She has a history of hallucinations, so is this just imaginary? As the story unfolds, we find out that someone caused the ""accident"", and now the police suspect Ms. Rohm's character had something to do with it. Roma Maffia plays the highly suspicious cop on the case. Stacey Dash is one of the circle of friends that try to help Ms. Rohm. IMAGE is a decent supernatural thriller w/ an interesting -though somewhat sappy- storyline. Worth checking out...",1310342400,2,638,4.8090909090909095
8363615,5,B002C8YRZC,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film!  The story was great, the cast was excellent and the locations were well chosen!
I have always thought lofts to be somewhat creepy, so the decision to make that the primary location was a very
good one!  Loved the unexpected scares and the twists and turns!  I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice
in the same day!  I highly recommend it and hope that you enjoy it!!",1265155200,2,404,4.346666666666667
8363616,5,B002C8YRZC,"Right up front, I was involved in the making of this movie.  Nonetheless, I'd like to share some thoughts and tell you what we've heard from others.
This is an independent movie (a psychological thriller), shot very professionally on 35mm film with lead actors all from Hollywood.  The script is very intelligent, and many people like the movie even better on second viewing, as they pick up on clues, foreshadowing, and other subtleties.  The camera-work is gorgeous, the settings are all real locations, and scenes are very atmospheric.  Most people are surprised and impressed by Elisabeth Rohm's (4 seasons on ""Law & Order,"" ""Miss Congeniality 2"") emotional performance.  Waylon Payne (""Walk the Line""), Stacey Dash (""Clueless""), and Matthew Del Negro (""West Wing,"" ""Sopranos""} turn in fine performances, and Roma Maffia (""Boston Legal"", ""Nip/Tuck"") gets the most mixed feedback.  Half of viewers love and half hate her performance as a police detective; there's not much in-between.  The original music is great, and the movie's ending - well, most people are surprised; let's leave it at that.
The DVD features commentary by the Producer, Writer/Director, and Cinematographer.  We included a ""making of"" feature that will be of special interest to movie-lovers and independent cinema folks.  There are also deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a music video of the end-credits song.
Frankly, we're proud of our movie, and we very much hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading!",1264636800,9,1475,5.211864406779661
8363617,4,B002C8YRZC,"Not a bad little movie.  While Elisabeth Rohm acquits herself well, I wish I could say the same for Roma Mafia, whose performance as what I think was supposed to be a very world weary policewoman, comes across as wooden.  SPOILER ALERT!!!!  There's a neat twist towards the end, another at the end...the main character turns out not to have been driven insane b y her boyfriend's murder, and, she dies.  While no one likes to see the heroine die, I expected to see a movie where she has to prove she isn't crazy to all, and in the end, finds another lover.",1251763200,3,556,4.368932038834951
