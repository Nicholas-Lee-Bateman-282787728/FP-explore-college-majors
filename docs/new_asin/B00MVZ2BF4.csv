8674906,5,B00MVZ2BF4,"I bought this for:  The Legacy, I found it made more sense buying the set, instead of buying it alone.  The Legacy, a very good movie, keeps your interest.  The Sentinel, not as good, but ok.  A slow movie, that could have done better.  If Scored separately:  The Legacy - 5, and The Sentinel....a strong 3.",1513814400,3,307,4.392857142857143
8674907,4,B00MVZ2BF4,I remember seeing Sssssss in the drive in when I was a kid and it scared me to death! Still a few shocks 45 years later and a fun movie to watch.,1493164800,2,145,3.5625
8674908,5,B00MVZ2BF4,"Been wanting to see complete copy of Sentinel since 1978.  It is a good thriller. As to the Legacy, kind of negative:  Katherine Ross' legacy is a bond with Satan.  Have not watched ssssss yet",1492905600,2,192,4.428571428571429

8674911,5,B00MVZ2BF4,"The Legacy and The Sentinel are 2 of the best horror movies from the 70's! I got into 70's horror when I was in high school and had seen all of the current horror films, and these were among my favorites. It was great to see them again! 70's horror has an eeriness that few have been able to replicate in decades after. If you love the horror genre these are a must see!
For those just getting into older horror movies, be sure to see Rosemary's Baby, Burnt Offerings, and The Omen",1480550400,2,481,4.182795698924731

8674914,4,B00MVZ2BF4,"bought to have those classic horror movies of the 1970's, like ""the sentinel"" and ""ssss"" i liked them a lot when i was a teen.

mostly, i liked them for the concepts, the ideas. warning: they made a lot of sexually graphic films back then. i don't think they ever made an R film without a sex scene, so i don't recommend for kids.",1469232000,,330,4.15625
8674915,4,B00MVZ2BF4,"A fun and entertaining trio of 1970 horror films.  While none are great they are all entertaining.  The Legacy is a great teaming of Katharine Ross and her future husband Sam Elliott.  The Sentinel is a creepy little Devil tale full of stars and future stars.  Worth watching just to see people like Jeff Goldblum, Christopher Walken and Tom Berenger pop up in little roles with the large stars of the time.  I also believe it was the last or one of the last roles for Ava Gardner.  Sssssss is just a fun B movie flick full of big poisonous snakes.  Worth a watch entertainment.",1418083200,6,578,4.447619047619048
