8623215,4,B00GHJ3P5A,"Local folks from S.E. Michigan worked together to create a sweet, touching movie about loss, redemption and finding your way in life. Local minister Alan Maki wrote the screenplay and stars in this simple yet moving film about a man who is at his rope's end after a tragic string of unforeseen events in 2009 destroy his comfortable life: his wife & children are killed in a car crash that he survives, he then loses his job and eventually ends up homeless, playing his guitar and singing on the streets in order to scrape together enough money to rent a small room at a local boarding house and put food on the table to feed himself and his adopted cat. But as the saying goes, ""Everything happens for a reason."" Chance encounters with both good and bad people during the course of the film shape & guide him, helping him see things as they are. Learning to be thankful for what he DOES have and to begin looking towards the future with hope & optimism. Remembering & loving his family but leaving the past (and the hurt associated with it) in the past.

The acting is all done by local amateurs (and it shows) but considering that these guys essentially did this all by themselves, it's a pretty impressive feat. As a rule, I don't care much for preachy movies (or people), but SIDEWALK SINGER manages to keep the ""Jesus Freak"" stuff to a minimum and treats Christianity & Christians as just plain folks (which most of them are) rather than the in-your-face, fire-breathing TV evangelists and doomsday billboard-waving loony stereotypes that many non-religious people sadly associate with Jesus & Christianity nowadays. The entire film was shot in a small town in southeast Michigan called Tecumseh. It has a very quaint 'Anytown USA' look to it and the beautiful photography really helps capture the spirit & flavor of the state shaped like a mitten and shows it off to its best advantage.

The message of the film isn't anything that we haven't seen before in one form or another, but it's always nice to see a small upstart company going up against the by-the-numbers Hollywood movie machine that unceasingly floods the airwaves & theaters with rude, snarky, morally bankrupt product these days. Taking the film for exactly what it is, I quite enjoyed SIDEWALK SINGER. It's a little film with a big heart. I find myself actually looking forward to the company's next movie, ""Mr. What,"" which is supposed to be coming out sometime next year. The only bonus feature included on the DVD for SIDEWALK SINGER are the 14 original songs, which can be accessed separately from the film. 4 stars for this uplifting family-friendly amateur film.",1415664000,2,2640,4.762008733624454
8623216,2,B00GHJ3P5A,"What a great movie I thought! Until I got toward the end and Chis made a statement that just destroyed the whole movie. He was talking to the young lady he met in the cemetary at the beginning of the movie and they were talking about how God worked in their lives and how great things turned out. Chris stated ""Its like the Phoenix riseing out of the ashes"". Does Alan Maki know who the Phoenix is? The Red Dragon of Revelation that rises from the pit! The Fire Bird! The movie would have gotten 5 stars if were not for that statement.",1411776000,3,535,4.203883495145631
8623217,4,B00GHJ3P5A,It was a very inspiring story.  I enjoyed it very much.  I recommend it for churches and people who love inspirational stories.,1398211200,3,127,4.7272727272727275
8623218,5,B00GHJ3P5A,"This film moved me to tears at several points.  The story was very touching, and the characters were very likeable.  The main character, his cool pet cat, the Pastor, the veterinarian friend, the street people, and a little boy named Micah... I loved them all.  The plot grabbed me right away and never lost me.  Through the pain of loss, hardship, betrayal and setbacks, the love of Christ can transform a broken life into one of hope, forgiveness, and renewal.  I find myself thinking about the story and the different characters long after the movie has ended.",1391558400,4,563,4.762886597938144
8623219,5,B00GHJ3P5A,"The best part about this film is that the acting is believable and the storyline grabs you, making it all feel real.  The Dove Foundation gave this movie ""5 Doves all the way,"" also calling it ""Inspiring... Remarkable... A triumph!""  It won Best Original Screenplay and Best Soundtrack at the Churches Making Movies Christian Film Festival in New Jersey, and when you watch it, you can see why!  What a beautiful experience!",1390521600,3,424,4.861111111111111
