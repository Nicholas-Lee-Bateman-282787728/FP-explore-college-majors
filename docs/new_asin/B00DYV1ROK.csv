5879700,2,B00DYV1ROK,"Loved ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes""! Marvel has made a huge mistake by sacrificing character development for better animation. A good story can be told with stick figures and still be a good story. I guess you can tell I am not impressed with ""Avengers Assemble"". If I wanted this type of story telling I would watch ""Marvel Superhero Squad"" more often(Hero up!). But really, a two episode release!? If it was better than EMH I would probably buy it. So far the writers of these ""Squadies"" have not shown any promise in these first two episodes. Go back to the EMH formula and release a 13 episode or more DVD and I will buy it.",1378339200,28,625,4.491228070175438
5879701,5,B00DYV1ROK,"Don't let the E.M.H's fans stop you from buying this fantastic DVD. This is not as good as E.M.H, but the story, action, and animation make up for the lack of character development . I give this show a 5 stars !",1376092800,3,211,4.0476190476190474
5879702,5,B00DYV1ROK,"Great start for a great new series!  The first 2 eps were very good. Each new eps is getting better, up to eps 6 now. EMH was great but told it's story. This new series has more character and can't wait to see more heroes and villains. With all the bonus extras it's a great buy. For a brand new series it has a strong content already. Great Sundays again with this new Avengers, Ultimate Spiderman and the upcoming Hulk toon. Marvel is really doing great with their toons and movies.",1375142400,4,484,4.318681318681318
5879703,1,B00DYV1ROK,"Sorry Pass.... wait for a 13 or 26 episode release, oh and bring back EMH while your at it, AA is an awful replacement. *Just wanted to edit my review slightly as it appears based on the now revealed running time (112 minuuets) that there will be at least 3 ""bonus"" episodes. One of these has been revealed as a Hulk & The Agents of SMASH episode ""Galactus Goes Green"", which as of this date has not even aired on Disney (that I assume will change, although EMH S2 had an episode that never aired at all for some odd reason...). The others will probably be an Ultimate Spider-Man and something else featuring as many crossovers as possible. Bonus Episodes are nice, but still not enough to justify a purchase especially when a season is 26 episodes long.

With only half of USM S1 on DVD to date (and the 13 disc 2 DVD set didn't even have the episodes in order, just randomly chosen episodes featuring other heroes), this could get messy very fast. Its nice Disney has three shows with the same animaiton set in the same universe for consistancy, despite their mediocre storytelling, but releasing DVD's seemingly at random from all different series is going to only frustrate fans. After this Impulse DVD gets released, do the right thing Disney, release the rest of USM S1, and moving forward just release everything else in chronological order. Thank you.",1375056000,62,1359,4.639004149377594

5879708,3,B00DYV1ROK,"This was cute but not what I expected. I would have liked more of the ""stuck in the same apartment"" idea, which really only happens at the very end. It was a fun watch but I wish I hadn't paid this much to see it. I'm pretty tolerant of cartoons--big Scooby-Doo fan--but this didn't quite measure up to $15 worth of entertainment. My advice: don't pay more than $5.",1408579200,,365,4.304347826086956

5879712,1,B00DYV1ROK,"The storylines are poor, the character depiction of the Avengers is very poor. The animation in general is poor. Aimed at anyone who doesn't care what there TV is showing. I'm praying there is no season 2.",1399161600,,205,4.5675675675675675

5879714,3,B00DYV1ROK,"Marvel's Avengers Assemble is decent. EMH is a much better show. Disney is using its huge amount of money to buy all the great titles and then for lack of a better word,Destroys them!
They buy these great titles and then kiddifies them. I understand that these stories are for a younger crowd. But not babies. The ultimate Spiderman for instance, theres never a serious moment in the show. Theres allways a tiny spiderman with a big head popping up doing something silly. Its almost the same with Avengers Assemble. Maybe a little better. Now they purchased Starwars and discontinued The Clone Wars. Now that really bothers me. Please don't destroy Starwars!
But anyway, If you have money to burn and your buying for an 8 year old then this is the DVD for you.
But if you are a real Marvel fan and a collector. Then i would wait for more than a 2 episode release. I hope this has been helpful..",1396569600,6,894,4.49079754601227
5879715,1,B00DYV1ROK,There are only 2 episodes on this dvd. I will not waste my money on this. They should of never stopped EMH show. That show was awesome!!,1393632000,,136,4.074074074074074
5879716,5,B00DYV1ROK,"It has five episodes in one disk which is really the only problem I could find with it. I love the art, its very colorful and actually funny. -Thor doesn't look weird like he does in all the others.- the voicing is good and plot interesting. As I said; I simply wish there was more. I'll just look up the other episodes on line until the complete season is up for sale.
1)The Avengers Protocol Part 1
2) The Avengers Protocol Part 2
3) Ghost of a Chance
4) The Serpent of Doom
5) Blood Feud",1391299200,18,490,4.114583333333333
5879717,5,B00DYV1ROK,"I love this new series from Marvel. Great cast, and as always the characters are very intriguing. I can't wait for the next season!!!",1389312000,,133,4.583333333333333
5879718,3,B00DYV1ROK,"I agree that the drawing is infinitely more better but they could have just changed the drawing in the original series that was only on for two seasons, not cancel it altogether. The new series while having great art dumbed the show down to compensate for the better art? The original show had great and intelligent plots, characters with depth, character interaction etc. You could feel for the characters in the original series, not so in the new series, plus 3 episodes for 15 bucks isn't a very good deal. I can wait until the first season comes out. They also made the hulk exceptionally stupid and angrier for some reason in this new series unlike the first series where he was angry but he actually did some thinking. Then in the new series hulk and the agents of S.M.A.S.H where he is the team leader working for shield he's portrayed as extremely intelligent even though he splits his time between both teams? So he's dumb in one show and intelligent in the other show? Go figure. Disney get the continuity together and get the writers back from the old Avengers show. Then you would have a winning combination. Not a bad show but could be better.",1388793600,,1156,4.5893719806763285

5879721,1,B00DYV1ROK,"So from what I've read, Marvel cancelled an entertaining, successful series called ""Earth's Mightiest Heroes"" because they wanted tighter movie-universe continuity. Instead of just adjusting those elements within EMH, they cancelled it. The writing for ""Avengers Assemble"" is right up there with The Smurfs. The dialogue is atrocious. Hawkeye chatters on like a preteen girl while his teammates are being pummeled, and what's worse, he won't shut up. There are no layers to these characters -- none of the Wasp/AntMan tension from the previous series, for example, or Hulk struggling to accept his place among puny humans, or the hands-on vs. technology tug-o-war between Cap and Iron Man. Whereas EMH was fun for all ages, AA panders to the 7-year-old toy buying crowd -- which of course it their prerogative. It's just disappointing when a superior product was needlessly cancelled for something like this. It would be like Pat Riley dismantling the Miami Heat, then reforming them as the Philadelphia 76ers.",1385510400,12,1010,5.279503105590062
5879722,2,B00DYV1ROK,It didn't give me the whole season ;( for the money I paid out they could have gave more it's only three episodes on there!!!,1383350400,13,125,4.04
5879723,1,B00DYV1ROK,"Avengers Assemble is half-baked and inferior across the board to Avengers: EMH in story, character development, dialogue, animation and ultimately, substance. This is not completely surprising as Marvel continues to make decisions that prizes lining up the continuity of all forms of multi-media (comic book, cartoons, films) to emulate the product as exemplified in the films. Do yourself a favor, if you really want these 2 episodes burn them off your DVR from the Disney XD on Demand channel, don't waste your money on an inferior product that values you as a consumer so little, it gives you a total of 2 episodes. Really, 2? Pathetic.",1381104000,28,639,5.037735849056604
