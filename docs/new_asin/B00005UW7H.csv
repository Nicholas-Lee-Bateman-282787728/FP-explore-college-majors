1668958,1,B00005UW7H,"Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco must be related to Kornbluth...as well as anyone who writes a positive review about this film. Instead of a ""winning comedy"" (as Lasalle leads the unassuming consumer to believe), Haiku Tunnel comes through with the worst plot line, acting, gimmicks and comedic attempts to ever be put on film. Kornbluth, looking eerily like the Principal from Billy Madison by the way, has just made the day of anyone that has had anything with the movie ""Ishtar"". We now have a new heir to the thrown of the title ""Worst Movie Of All Time"". Do not waste your time...",1016409600,4,586,4.644230769230769

This made it an extremely personal experience.  I must say, he hit the nail on the head!  A must see for all employees of law firms!",1014854400,2,273,4.313725490196078
1668960,5,B00005UW7H,"Josh Kornbluth (Josh Kornbluth), ambles from temp job to temp job as he contemplates writing the Great American novel. He is perfectly content to take these jobs, because, as he points out, he's a really good temp. They also allow him the freedom to concentrate on other things. Yes, he has to live in a small dump of an apartment in the Mission District in ""San Franclisco"" (a `fictional' town, the setting for his `fictional' story, but he actually enjoys his life. Then he accepts a temp assignment working for Bob Shelby (Warren Keith) at the law firm of Schuyler & Mitchell. Josh notices strange things at S & M, but he goes about his assignment. Then Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker), the head Secretary, asks Josh if he wants ""to go perm?"" Josh accepts and everything begins to unravel.
""Haiku Tunnel"" is simply one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long, long time.
Josh Kornbluth reportedly developed a one-man show called ""Haiku Tunnel"" based on his adventures as a Legal Temp. He and his brother Jacob worked for a long time to turn the play into a film. The film, directed by the Kornbluth Brothers works amazingly well. We follow Josh's adventures as he wades through the bureaucracy of office life and John frequently takes us aside to share his observations.
Every character in the film is pitch perfect. If you have ever worked at a law firm, in an office or for a temp agency, you will most likely recognize the people. Bob Shelby is easily one of the funniest characters ever created for a film and Warren Keith is brilliant in bringing the stoic, emotionless lawyer to life. He almost steals every scene he is in. This is quite an accomplishment considering the actor playing against him, Josh Kornbluth, created the character. Keith's monotone is very evocative of a supervisor who wants to do a great job, expects his employees to do a great job, but can't quite summon the will to enforce this desire.
Josh Kornbluth is hilarious playing a character that he goes to great pains to try to convince the audience is fictional. He makes frequent observations, which is usually a technique that is sure to annoy me, but his observations are very funny, very accurate and well-timed. He has to deal with the stigma of being a temp, the quick revelation of going perm, his various office workers, office machines, procrastination, artificial environments, desperate office celebrations, security guards and computer professionals who work all hours. There isn't a single joke in the film which doesn't create a laugh.
Marlina D'Amore, played by Helen Shumaker, is also perfect. Slightly condescending, finally embracing the role of mother to the office, she walks around with an all-knowing, silent attitude which is simply a marvel to behold. ""Josh, would you like to go... perm?""
Mindy, Clifford and DaVonne (Amy Resnick, Brian Thorstenson and June Lomena respectively) are the three other secretaries in the office. Each is a perfect example of a specific type of office worker you have already met. Each is well-thought out and very unique. It is unusual to have this level of detail for the individual characters in any film. These three have been in the office long enough to recognize all of the ins and outs. ""She's a pusher"" and ""Hi, Josh. So we hear you went Perm?"" are just two of their many funny lines.
""Haiku Tunnel"" is a rare thing. The pitch perfect, consistently funny and inventive comedy.",1011139200,27,3428,4.8217317487266556

Because of this, there are few movies that I can honestly say I could not finish.

1668971,3,B00005UW7H,"Now, Office Space is, for many, one of the funniest films to comment on the work place, especially those with massive 'cubicle farms'.  But for the temps out there, or even just those that work for lawyers, this film is truly yours.

Yes, it is not as overtly humorous as Office Space, but after all that legal jargon you probably are thinking pretty analytically.  If so, good, because you'll get the gist of this film that much more easily.

Oh yeah, what is the gist.

Well, first of all, this film is about Josh.  (Hi Josh.)  Josh is, and has always been a temp; however, one time he gets snagged into a 'perm' job.  So when his life suddenly takes a more committed turn, Josh has to deal or be dealt with.  And when he continually puts off sending 17 letters, he comes to that point in his life, and well as crossroads are, you have to go somewhere.

So that's it, and once again while this film is quite unique, it still is rather approachable, (and for a slightly younger audience then Office Space).",1142380800,,1007,4.394594594594595

Obviously, from a few posts, some people didn't like the movie as much. I'm not sure what they didn't see in the movie but I guess any movie has its fans as well as some disappointed viewers. At least here, there is a chance for some real belly-laughs.

I'm not certain who funded the writer/director/star/everything else, Mr. Kornbluth, but this person should be slapped for helping unleash this disaster. When I wasn't falling asleep during the lead's babbling asides to the camera, I was rolling my eyes at the corny, contrived dialogue (temp? perm? blah blah blah), desperately convoluted plot, and film-unfriendly theater-big performances. I understand this was based on Kornbluth's one-man show - it should have stayed that way. What likely was charming and vaguely amusing or poignant onstage falls flat on film.

1668974,5,B00005UW7H,"Josh Kornbluth, playing himself, is a nerdy, neurotic slacker who is supposedly writing a novel (on company time) while working as a temp in various law firms. His life begins to fall apart when he is given the chance to ""go perm."" His fear of success begins to overpower his need to please. In spite of a little help from his friends, he is unable or unwilling to complete the simple assignment of mailing out seventeen letters.

So, does he fail ignominiously? Does he end up unemployed? Or, what? You'll have to watch the movie to find out. You'll enjoy it, too, if you don't take it too seriously. And if it doesn't make you too nervous. Because Josh is a serious slacker and his headlong rush to disaster might just make you uncomfortable.

The movie has a low-budget, almost amateurish feel, which, oddly enough, fits very well with its message. There is nothing slick or professional about Josh Kornbluth as portrayed in this film. He is a wonderful, remarkable, intentional loser. Other reviewers have mentioned the similarities to Dilbert, and to Office Space. While those portrayals emphasized the insanity of the corporate world, Haiku Tunnel is more about the quiet insanity of one self-absorbed but somehow lovable individual. I recommend it highly.

1668975,3,B00005UW7H,"Balding, bulbous Josh Kornbluth stars in this extremely low-budget 2001 movie which he also co-wrote and co-directed with his brother. From this bargain basement set-up comes a frequently funny, sometimes insightful comedy about surviving the trials and tribulations of office politics. As a San Franciscan who has experienced the local economic downturn firsthand, I was recommended this movie by a friend who thought I could relate to the predicaments of the main character. Toward that end, much like a series of live action Dilbert cartoons, Kornbluth does an often spot-on job capturing the inanities of the workplace and dealing with one's boss and co-workers.

""Haiku Tunnel"" doesn't really have a plot, but the slim premise revolves around seventeen letters that ""have to go out right away"" according to the unctous boss, typically named Bob. In what appears to be not too much of an acting stretch, Kornbluth portrays ""Josh Kornbluth"" (with quotations please), an aspiring novelist living in a depressive funk and working contently as an office temporary worker. For one procrastinating reason after another, ""Josh"" can't seem to get the letters out, and in a contained world that seems to thrive on passive-aggressive behavior, he faces little retribution for his failure. Although no DeNiro, Kornbluth does capture the subservient demeanor of a temp accurately, doing a lackey's shuffle when the boss is around or, when he's late, an all-too-innocent float past the desk of the head secretary, played with a chilly sense of curtailed authority by Helen Shumaker. At heart, ""Josh"" is really a sad sack having just been dumped by his mountain-biking girlfriend. He's a guy with nothing going on and no pleasure except finding his way to his bed in San Francisco's mixed Mission district. He is comfortable with his limitations as a temp, but it's the promise of health benefits that persuades ""Josh"" to switch from temp to permanent status. So when he takes a full-time job at the law firm Schuyler and Mitchell (""S&M""), he can have the firm pay for his psychotherapy sessions to remove his apparent writer's block. I do love how ""Josh"" suddenly becomes visible in the eyes of his co-workers only once he goes ""perm"". And in a funny cameo appearance, Harry Shearer plays a patronizing company trainer teaching the finer points of dealing with jammed paper in the copier.

The film gets somewhat off-track when ""Josh"" gets involved with Julie, an attorney who becomes attracted to him as she mistakes him for an eccentric tax attorney. Sarah Overman is actually terrific as Julie, but the movie slides into some surreal world that diminishes audience sympathy for ""Josh"" at a rather critical juncture in the threadbare story. The seduction scene actually reminds me of a similar scene in Tom Hanks' film, ""Big"", and the movie never quite gains its footing afterward. But at that point, it doesn't seem to matter as the movie has already lost its steam. I give kudos to Kornbluth for making a clever assault on the white-collar workplace, but rent episodes of Ricky Gervais' ""The Office"" if you want a more pointed satire of that world.",1106524800,4,3143,5.053949903660886
1668976,4,B00005UW7H,"This is a wonderful movie.  If you need fast action or obvious humor stop right here.  Otherwise, strap in and follow closely the subtle, quirky humor of Josh Kornbluth as he paints a funny picture of anxiety/depression through his life as a ""temp"" on his way to becoming a ""perm.""",1105747200,2,281,4.6
1668977,1,B00005UW7H,"In this incredibly unfortunate movie, Josh Kornbluth ""stars"" as Josh Kornbluth, a lazy and unmotivated temp worker looking to ""go perm"" at his current assignment. Besides being lazy and unmotivated, Kornbluth spends much of his time at work trying to finish a novel of some sort to the detriment of his actual job. Things come to a head when he is asked to deliver 17 VERY IMPORTANT letters and, predictably enough, he fails to do so. The rest of the movie is spent attempting to salvage his job and cultivate a ludicrous relationship with a beautiful executive with the aid of his co-workers and so-called ""friends.""

Where this film primarily fails is in its painful attempts at humor. I wanted to laugh and I wanted to enjoy this movie, but I could do neither. All of the jokes fall flat. The reason for this is that they all sound like inside jokes or you-had-to-be-theres. For the obvious reasons, this mode of operation does not really lend itself to appealing to a broad audience. That's not meant to suggest that a film's popularity is a surefire indicator of its quality, but it is difficult to relate to or to sympathize with the bizarre and completely unmotivated protagonist that we have been stuck with. The plot itself is not particularly engaging, and when you combine that with the hellishly unfunny jokes as well as the unsympathetic characters, you have all the makings of a terrible movie. I cannot for any reason recommend this boring, trite, and unsatisfying movie.",1104624000,3,1486,4.8046875
1668978,4,B00005UW7H,"The latter part of the 1990s, when more people than ever before toiled away in the corporate world thanks to a massive increase in dot.com jobs, saw the emergence of a particularly funny film called ""Office Space."" This movie dealt with the trials and tribulations of a young computer programmer as he attempted to navigate his way through the nerve racking atmosphere created by condescending bosses, cubicles, and weird co-workers. The film has since assumed the venerated moniker of ""cult classic,"" and rightfully so. Anyone who has served time in the corporate world instantly recognizes the annoying day to day events depicted in the film: the banal paperwork, the hierarchy of bosses, boredom, the perky office worker, consultants...the list could go on and on. ""Haiku Tunnel,"" while not achieving anything close to the magic of ""Office Space,"" covers much of the same territory. Instead of taking place in an IT firm, this film follows the exploits of a temporary worker whose world is suddenly turned upside down when a law firm offers him full-time employment. The title of the film comes from an architectural project the main character worked on during one of his temp assignments.

Josh Kornbluth (played by Josh Kornbluth) is a wannabe author living in San Francisco who must work in between bouts of writing. He's a great temp employee, one of the best in fact, because the job allows him to move around the city without the long-term stress attendant to a regular job. All of that changes, however, when he shows up for an assignment at Schuyler & Mitchell (S&M), a big shot law firm filled with a host of corny characters. For one thing, all of the attorneys have the name Bob, including Josh's newest boss Bob Shelby (Warren Keith). His co-workers are a bit odd too. You've got the evil office manager Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker), and a trio of annoying co-workers that won't have anything to do with Josh until they learn the company took him on full-time. Right from the start Kornbluth runs into trouble. The entire process of assuming responsibility saps his strength as an office employee. He finds himself working on his book at work, avoiding conflicts, and showing up late for the first time in ages. The real problems start with seventeen simple but very important letters that Shelby claims must go out in the mail immediately. For some reason, Josh cannot get them done. Days go by and the letters still sit on his desk like clouds of impending doom.

The majority of the film centers on Josh's various efforts to find motivation to get these letters out. He does everything except mail the letters: his book distracts him, a relationship that springs up suddenly causes him to forget about the correspondence, and his neverending neurosis about everything from his bed to his former girlfriend constantly conspire to bring him down. As Josh anguishes about the letters, he learns much about his new corporate surroundings. He spends a day in orientation learning the ins and outs of such metaphysically important tasks such as how to clear jammed paper out of a copier (look for Harry Shearer in the role as the monotone instructor). In order to explain this alien world and his actions within it, the film occasionally cuts away to Josh standing in front of chalkboard for an ""actor to audience"" explanation of what's really going on. As for Kornbluth himself, he looks like...well, he's hard to describe. He's a pudgy, balding, loud guy with glasses that is about as far from a corporate type as you could imagine. In many ways, it is his appearance and how he conducts himself that makes ""Haiku Tunnel"" quite amusing.

Unfortunately, not everything inspires laugh out loud laughter. Actually, I don't remember laughing out loud once during the entire movie, although I did find ""Haiku Tunnel"" entertaining and rather clever in spots. I think the performances are the best thing in the movie. Kornbluth's acceptable, but Helen Shumaker as the icy cold Marlina steals every scene she's in. The actress is quite beautiful in her way and has a wonderful head of hair, both of which she uses to great effect as she looms ominously over Josh's new life. The scene where he leaves a lengthy message on her answering machine, and her reaction to the same the next day, is worth seeing and something more of us should probably do to an irritating co-worker. As for the boss, everyone in the film talks about Bob Shelby as though he is Satan's son, but he actually comes off as a sort of absentminded, incompetent stooge. Josh's three co-workers tend to take things a bit overboard. DaVonne (June Lomena), a black gal with a lot of attitude, stands out of the bunch. Josh has a thing for her, and it's funny to watch her spurn his puppy dog advances. What I didn't like as much was Kornbluth's constant self-analysis and endless hamming. Throttling back on the Woody Allen shtick might have helped the film. The asides where Josh lectures the audience obviously comes from his background as a stage artist, and regrettably don't fit well in the movie.

For a low budget film, the ""Haiku Tunnel"" DVD contains quite a few extras. You get several deleted scenes, a commentary track from Kornbluth, outtakes, and trailers for this film, ""Jackpot,"" and ""The Tao of Steve,"" which stars that annoying Scottish comedian Donal Logue. While Kornbluth's intensely personal film isn't as good as the awesome ""Office Space,"" it is worth watching. I would watch it again, in fact. This is the sort of film you absolutely much see if your corporate job is becoming too much to bear. It will probably make you feel slightly better to know there are many fellow sufferers.",1096243200,,5682,4.848609680741504
1668979,4,B00005UW7H,"will be amused by this movie -- it satirizes so many aspects of American corporate office life that we've come to take for granted (the IT sysadmin is a stitch -- and it's so true that from time to time they just reconfigure things for no apparent reason and cause things that used to work to quit working, like printers and passwords -- bringing your work to a halt).

The story involves Josh, a plump would-be novelist temp who turns from being productive to being totally nonproductive when he goes from temp to perm in a high-power SF lawfirm -- S & M.  You wouldn't believe how much difficulty he has typing and mailing out 17 letters -- very important letters -- in a story that literature teachers would describe as picaresque -- one catastrophe after another, including Josh's neuroses, prevent him from getting this simple task done.

This is a low key, low budget, but amusing ""art film"".  If your idea of the perfect movie is Lethal Weapon, there's a good chance you may not like this film, but if you are amused by literate, understated comedy and aren't terribly fond of working in an office, you will probably enjoy this take off on office life in America.",1095552000,3,1170,4.583732057416268

(Huge dork can't manage to mail 17 important letters for his boss, given a whole week in which to do it, doesn't deserve to be called a plot.)

I was befuddled by the ""R"" rating as well. Evidently laughable (and mostly clothed) coupling plus a couple of four-letter words will do that. But this time I agree with the MPAA--as many people should be protected from this disaster of a film as possible.
In closing, I will say that ""Haiku Tunnel"" is a perfect example of why Sony shouldn't call its ""indie"" film arm ""Sony Picture Classics.""

Maybe it hits home for me because I also worked for a temp agency before ""going perm."" And I do have this burning sense of creativity inside of me that sometimes takes priority over my work, just as the character of Josh places more importance on working on his novel than mailing out 17 ""very important"" letters for his boss. And yes, I do have a co-worker that is as flamboyant as the character of Clifford. But I don't think either of these qualities make it necessary to enjoy this film.

That being said, I don't believe a minute passed in this movie where I wasn't laughing out loud. Although I did not really identify with the main character of Josh in any way (nor any of the characters now that I think about it), I found him to be very interesting and I enjoyed following his daily adventures as a temp gone perm.
This movie was a great character study of various people from all walks of life ending up in the same small space, which I'm sure anybody that's worked in any kind of office can relate to. And in between all the comedy is some pretty brilliant social commentary as well.
Not to say that intelligent people will automatically like this, nor that those lacking intelligence will not, but this film definitely caters to those who tend to prefer smart humor.",1072137600,12,1096,4.5125628140703515

The movie tries to employ clever commentary.  However, there was nothing clever about this movie.  We all hate mail outs and computer printers are frustrating.  We get it.  There was nothing fresh or intriguing offered.  Needless to say I did not crack much of a smile.  Stick with movies like Office Space for an actually entertaining office-themed comedy.

1668989,5,B00005UW7H,"I saw this movie on HBO.  When the movie started, I did not think much of Josh Kornbluth, I did not find him engaging.
However, as the film progressed, I found myself laughing, several times out loud.  The next day, I thought of scenes in the movie and found myself laughing over and over again.
The beginning of the movie does not seem to lead someone to believe that this is going to be a rip-roaring, laughfest, but in fact it was.
The trials and tribulations faced by this character is mountains made out of molehills, with the infamous 17 letters.  The secretaries are funny, all the attorneys named Bob are funny, and the oldest bike courier in the world is funny.
I really can not say enough great things about this film.
It is a quiet comedy and requires some thought and careful attention.  But it will have you chuckling for days.",1039651200,15,840,4.470588235294118
1668990,3,B00005UW7H,"As the credits rolled for HAIKU TUNNEL, I was left wondering if a piece of cinematic brilliance had passed completely over my head, or if I'd just seen an essentially pointless, albeit quixotic and mildly entertaining, comedy.
Josh Kornbluth plays ""Josh Kornbluth"", a cheerfully oddball character employed by an office temp agency, Uniforce. Perhaps Josh is the only resource in the Unifoce pool; it's an implied possibility. In any case, the plot follows the first week of our hero's employment with the law firm of Schuyler & Mitchell (""S&M""), where he's the personal secretary to one of the senior partners,  Bob Shelby (Warren Keith). Josh is so impressive on his first day that he's offered a permanent position, a turn of events that causes him no small degree of angst. Josh is comfortable being a ""temp"". As a matter of fact, everything about him seems temporary, including his relationships with the opposite sex and his dedication to his dream of being a successful novelist. Josh is easily sidetracked by his anxiety at the prospect of a steady gig, and this inability to focus endangers his position with S&M as for four days he fails to get together and mail seventeen urgent letters for an incredibly patient Bob. The film's whole plot, mind you, revolves around this problematic stack of missives.
The movie's most interesting persona is Marlina (Helen Shumaker), the Head Secretary and Kornbluth's immediate boss. She confronts Josh at the most inconvenient times, and voices her advice, admonitions, instructions or enquiries in a dead-pan and squinty-eyed, husky monotone that's positively eerie - an effect enhanced by the camera's close-up on her vaguely sinister face as she delivers her lines.
At one point in the film, Josh reminisces about a previous job which involved his transcribing the engineering specs for the HAIKU TUNNEL, a highway tunnel ostensibly under construction in Hawaii. I share this trivia tidbit if you're wondering about the film's title. And, trust me, I haven't spoiled any part of the plot by offering this revelation.
As with some trips I've taken, the attraction of HAIKU TUNNEL is in the Going rather than in the Getting There (because, as time and events prove, there's no ""there"" to get to). I was strangely fascinated by the quirky storyline, and kept waiting for the closing punch line to be delivered, or for the other shoe to drop. This either never happened, or was so subtle that I missed it. However, along the way, the screenwriters (Josh and Jacob Kornbluth and John Bellucci) illustrate some truths concerning the sterility and absurdities of the average 9 to 5. Perhaps, if you like the comic strip Dilbert, you'll see merit in this film.",1036108800,2,2702,5.004444444444444
1668991,5,B00005UW7H,"As if there were a lot of comedies about office temps.  Actually the last one (and only other one) I remember was called ""Clockwatchers"", which was an indie movie that featured Lisa Kudrow, Toni Collette and Parker Posey.  This one doesn t have as much star power (although there is a scary looking Harry Shearer making a kind of unnecessary cameo that anyone else could have done) but ""Haiku Tunnel"" is that rare indie comedy that you think might be slightly funny when you see it one the new release rack.  It's much better than that!  You know when a movie starts with the Pixies classic ""Debaser"" that something good is coming up.  Josh Kornbluth plays himself (kind of, sort of) in this office comedy of errors.  Josh is temp that often works at law firms and while he like most of us can t stand the 9 to 5, he gets by (his solace is the fact that his bed is waiting for him at home).  Josh get signals that his latest job might be for the devil, so he better do a good job. He is proficient that he is urged to take permanent status on the first day.  He does and that s when things should turn around for this man that lives in the temp zone.  It doesn't as he finds a myriad of excuses to prolong an important task that he was suppose to do right away (the mailing out of 17 very important letters).
This movie has to be seen to be believed.  It is filled with witty dialogues (and monologues), real life scenarios and the talent of this cast.  Helen Shumaker (Marlina) is such an excellent comic actor she deserves the Academy Award for Supporting Actress (alas, no nods for this movie).  ""Haiku Tunnel"" is the universal office comedy that is about a loser s loser but he is so real and candid that you can t help but like him and feel his predicament.  I unfortunately bought the video on impulse so I can t talk about the extras on the DVD but the movie is a laugh riot.  Its a must own or at the very least rent.",1034467200,8,1925,4.209809264305177
1668992,1,B00005UW7H,"I have a feeling that the other positive reviews on Amazon must be from friends of Kornbluth.
Watching Haiku Tunnel is like watching a film put together with a consumer video camera by an untrained amateur. It tries to be funny - Kornbluth talks to the viewer while ""acting"" with the people in the film - it's as though he's doing the viewer a BIG favor and letting on to an inside joke. Only, the joke isn't funny.  Kornbluth manages to be pathetic on condescending to the viewer at the same time. By condescending, I mean he lets us know when a gag is coming and ""Surprise!"" The gag isn't funny because he told us the gag was coming and it wasn't a surprise.  It isn't even an interesting story - it's painful to watch, even embarrassing. The plot revolves around his inability to mail 17 ""very important"" letters which are on his desk.
While that's one heck of an idea for a film, it somehow doesn't work here.
I turned the movie off. I hope Kornbluth finds success as a temp, because this movie is a failure. I can't believe it was released.",1030752000,5,1045,4.381443298969073
1668993,2,B00005UW7H,"If you're thinking you've stumbled upon a more zen rendition of ""Office Space"", think again.  The jacket would lead you to believe you've found a funny & clever working place story, but more than likely you'll be waiting for humor to shoot into orbit, when in reality it simply sputters on the launching pad.  The premise seems to hold validity as a funny scenario - successful temp becomes chaotic perm - but the writing and directing are a bit too amateurish to pull it all off.  Josh Kornbluth is able to entertain, but only in spurts during the film.  Some of it is very predictable, once you get going, and from there on you're waiting for something that just never happens. The only thing you'll be concentrating on is why the heck isn't he mailing the letters?  The supporting cast does a very credible job, specifically the head secretary, the lawyer who Josh works for, and the female lawyer he trysts with.  The rest is pretty much forgettable.",1027296000,3,954,4.648809523809524
1668994,4,B00005UW7H,"I have to say, speaking as an office temp who has worked for countless offices, I can relate to this film.  Especially since it's semi-autobiographical.  Some of the best parts where in the beginning especially the names (yes, I have worked with a man who has a III in his title and prefers us to use it) and my discman does have a Pixies CD in it as I type this review.
  I have to say that my one chief complaint is near the end of the film when he meets a woman and one slight fib grows and grows.  Now don't get me wrong, it was highly enjoyable and entertaining.  But it seemed to have broken the flow of everything.  The disc itself is nice too, get a few trailers and a commentary as well as deleted scenes.  This movie has been compared to Office Space, which I can see, but this is a smart office comedy as to where Office Space is a mindless office comedy (which I enjoy as well).

1668995,1,B00005UW7H,"Office work, especially in this era of computers, multi-functional copy machines, e-mail, voice mail, snail mail and ""temps,"" is territory ripe with satirical possibilities, a vein previously tapped in such films as ""Clockwatchers"" and ""Office Space,"" and very successfully.  This latest addition to the temp/humor pool, however, ""Haiku Tunnel,"" directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth, fails to live up to it's predecessors, and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door, waiting for a chance to sneak in.  Unfortunately for the audience, that chance never comes; so what you get is a nice try, but as the man once said, no cigar.
 As the narrator/star of the film, Josh Kornbluth (playing Josh Kornbluth), points out in the opening frames (in a monologue delivered directly into the camera), this story is pure fiction, and takes place in the fictional city of ""San Franc'l'isco.""  It's an innovative, if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer, and not all that funny.  It is, however, a harbinger of what is to follow, all of which-- like the disclaimer-- just isn't all that funny.
 Kornbluth plays Kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a ""temp.""  It's a job that suits him, and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time.  But when he goes to work for a lawyer, Bob Shelby (Warren Keith), he does too good a job on the first day, and Shelby dispatches head secretary Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) to Kornbluth to persuade him to go ""perm.""  The thought of working full time for the same company, though, initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth, but he caves in and signs on for the position.  He's nervous about it, but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which, of course, they would never do with a temp), and if things get too rough, he has seventeen important letters he's typed up-- that now just have to be mailed out-- to fall back on (he's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part, and he needs that ""something easy to do"" in reserve, in case it all gets to be too much for him).  These are ""important"" letters, however, and by the end of the week, Kornbluth still has them in reserve, on his desk.  And it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when Shelby finds out about it, Kornbluth's days as the fair-haired boy are going to be over.  And quick.
 The Brothers Kornbluth, who not only directed, but along with John Bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film, should have taken a page out of the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy, where it says ""If you play it straight, they will laugh.""  But, they didn't, and the audience won't.  Because in comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, when the main character (as well as most of the supporting characters, in this case) ""Plays"" funny-- as in, he ""knows"" he's being funny-- he never is.  And that's exactly what Kornbluth does here; so rather than being ""funny,"" he comes across as insincere and pretentious, a grievous error in judgment on the part of the Kornbluths, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own movie.
 In trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn't work, it comes down to two basic reasons:  The directing, which-- if not necessarily ""bad""-- is at least careless; and secondly, the performances, beginning with that of Josh Kornbluth.  Quite simply, Kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here.  Unlike Stiller, or even Steve Martin-- both of whom use self-deprecating humor very effectively-- Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light; he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he, the real Kornbluth, is in reality much more clever than Kornbluth the character.  And being unable to get past that does him in, as well as the film.  Rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify, Kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach.  So what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting, and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with, with an inexplicably narrow focus (given the potential of the rich subject matter), it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly.
 The one saving grace of the film is the performance by Warren Keith as Shelby, whose subtle delivery is convincing, and which-- in and of itself-- is fairly humorous.  The effectiveness of it is diminished, however, inasmuch as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth, which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project.
 Shumaker and Sarah Overman (Julie Faustino) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances, which are commendable, if not entirely memorable; they at least make their scenes watchable, and Overman even manages to elevate Kornbluth's performance, if only momentarily.  But it's still not enough to save the day or the film.
 The supporting cast includes Amy Resnick (Mindy), Brian Thorstenson (Clifford), June Lomena (DaVonne), Joe Bellan (Jimmy the Mail Clerk), with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking Harry Shearer, as the Orientation Leader-- a role that begs for an answer to the question, ""What was he thinking when he agreed to this?""  In any work environment, there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon, and the films depicting said situations will always be with us; the good ones (see paragraph one) may even become classics in their own right.  ""Haiku Tunnel,"" however, will doubtfully remain very long amongst them, for it's destiny lies elsewhere-- in a realm known only as:  ""Obscurity.""",1018569600,11,5890,4.894366197183099

In this case, the spoof is not about one particular recogizable type of movie, like Take the Money and Run, but about movies and law firms.  Half of the fun was thinking, I can't believe that the ""action"" and ""suspense"" are built on such a nothing event: mailing off a batch of important letters.  The blurb on the box says that this is nothing about Haiku, or tunnels, but I think it is more about Haiku than not.  Think about Haiku in terms of the smallness of the structure, a few short simple lines, used as a vehicle to say something that could have been done in a much bigger structure.
