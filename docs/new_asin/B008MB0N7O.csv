8528895,2,B008MB0N7O,"Purchased this DVD because it was not available from Netflix.  What I got was a COPY.
The printing for the case art was good but the printing on the DVD was clearly from an Inkjet printer.
The data side of the DVD was clearly written with a computer's DVD burner as production DVD's are different.
The dye layer was purple and the written data demarcation line was clearly visible.
The DVD used was a DVD-R (which does not have the Checksum that the DVD+R has).
The copy does not have chapters so you can not skip through the movie.
The Menu had one item on it ""Play""

I thought that it was illegal to sell copies through amazon unless it was a public domain movie???

The quality appears to be good though until you get to scenes that has a lot of movement.
Then the compression is visible because of minor image shifting.

Bottom line, you are not buying a RELEASE version of the movie but a compressed copy.",1520640000,,910,4.366863905325443
8528896,4,B008MB0N7O,"I enjoyed the story- relentless, with the right amount of dark humor to relieve the tension. The screenplay doesn't rely on cheap scares to provide the horror, instead the moodiness of the camera work and the implied terror works well to sustain the feeling. Ashley Nelson does a great job as the female lead- very believable and shows real promise as an actress. (Bad-ass heroine, too I might add.) John Collier's turn as a wheelchair bound savant is also worth keeping an eye on. I especially loved the scenes of him cruising through the darkness in his chair, hoping to avoid the creatures. Incidentally, I give Ken a couple of points each on the inclusion of the black cat and a blood-soaked Smores wrapper. The special effects were generally well done, with only a couple of missteps. The original music was thoughtful, well-implemented and made the production much more professional. I have to say that I'm biased in a number of regards (such as being a huge fan of the NC locations and having met Anita Richter.) The film never drags and a couple of the exposition scenes between the siblings were impressively written, filmed and delivered. The movie has all the hallmarks of a cult film in the making. By all means, watch the DVD to the end, well past the credits for one of the best scenes not included in the original production. Nice touch!",1489536000,,1352,4.708860759493671
8528897,2,B008MB0N7O,"There was way too much screaming.  Some of the ""actors"" should not quit their day jobs. The gorilla suits were pretty corny too.  I'd advise that you spend your money on another movie.",1429488000,,184,4.545454545454546
