8761279,3,B01FR35O64,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2013 and directed by Griff Furst, ""Ragin Cajun Redneck Gators"" (aka Alligator Alley) takes place in the Louisiana bayous when Avery (Jordan Hinson) returns from college (indoctrinated by liberalism, of course) to her redneck homestead where her kin are still feuding with a neighboring family. While she secretly dates the handsome son of the enemy (John Chriss), literal red-necked gators attack, mutated by bad moonshine that was poured into the swamp. But something even worse starts happening.

The title keys off that this is a campy, silly monster movie and not to be taken seriously, although theres some semi-serious dramatics and horrifics. Anyone wanting solemn horror should go to the Exit now. Jordan Hinson as the protagonist is a major attraction as shes winsome and all-around easy on the eyes. Theres a little bit of The Alligator People (1959) thrown in to keep things interesting. Bottom Line: Its not great, but its mildly entertaining as an amusing creature feature. Just remember: If the rednecks don't get ya... the gators will.

THE MOVIE RUNS 88 minutes and was shot in St. Amant & Baton Rouge, Louisiana . WRITERS: Keith Allan, Rafael Jordan & Delondra Williams.
