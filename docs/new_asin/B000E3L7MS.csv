2486505,5,B000E3L7MS,"Someone wrote a book I read called 1954: Television's Best Year (or something like that). That title would immediately bother viewers who think that '50s TV couldn't possibly have been any good since it was in black and white, and that everything newer is naturally better. By that reckoning of course, we should all stop reading Shakespeare, since he wrote pre-TV when nobody knew anything, and for that same reason many people have.

But being curious I started watching Rocky Jones Space Ranger on one of those $5 DVDs and was immediately taken in. What it lacked in technological prowess it more than made up in style, passion, wit and personality. When my DVD proved to be defective I searched for another copy to watch the rest of ""Crash of the Moons"".

Then I came on this bonanza from Passport Video which is practically a Rocky Jones telethon with sixteen episodes. Also on the five disc set are a film, ""Missle to the Moon,"", one  teaser episode of Flash Gordon (maybe to make you want the whole series) and a sci-fi documentary.

I realize that some reviewers have a low opinion of these budget sets of old TV shows, but I think they give you a lot of viewing at a low price. For history buffs it's a chance to check out some early shows. With almost 600 minutes of viewing on five one sided discs, Rocky Jones Space Ranger makes a strong case for 1954 as television's best year.",1151625600,34,1390,4.548
2486506,2,B000E3L7MS,"The Rocky Jones Space Ranger series may have been the last of 1950's ""space opera"" sci-fi shows, but it definitely was the best.  All those sci-fi shows had short comings of limited budgets, frantic production schedules, and convenient creative license in place of hard science.  But Rocky Jones was the only series to be shot on film (alas, B&W) by movie industry professionals and it showed.  Each episode looked more like a mini-movie rather than a live video shoe-string production of the 50's.

Rocky Jones had the best of the stories (most were 3 part, half-hour episodes that allowed in-depth story-telling), classic sci-fi characters,  imaginative 50's-futuristic design, and impressive special effects for a television series.  The icing on this space cake was Alexander Laszlo's mood-setting, electronic-punctuated music score.  (Of course, they had their clunkers, too, but let's be a little forgiving.)  The like was not to be seen again until nearly 15 years later in the form of Star Trek.  A federation of planets?  Automatic slide-open doors?  A stalwart captain and his trusty lieutenant on space patrol?  Boots & mini-skirts crew-women?  Strange cultures on alien worlds?  It was all there first in Rocky Jones Space Ranger.

Until recently, the only way to watch the space adventures of Rocky Jones was through 3rd parties selling their ""collector's copies"" of this now ""in the public domain"" show.  Quality varied wildly, being copies from copies of video tape or noticeably worn 16mm film.

A few years ago, Alpha Video began publishing the edited-together versions of Rocky Jones's 3-part story-arc episodes as ""full movies"" on DVD.  No ""clean up"" is obvious for the only fair video & audio quality of these releases.  While fair quality at low prices is a draw for some consumers, purists will miss the individual episodes, each with it's own titles and credits.

Now Passport has released a 5 DVD disc set of ""The Rocky Jones Space Ranger Collection"" ... an incomplete collection.  Only 4 discs contain Rocky Jones material.  The 5th disc contains unrelated ""sci-fi"" filler that, by rights, shouldn't be in this set.  Next, the discs are packaged in a double-thick case that holds the DVD's on the inside front and back covers, and on a center flap.  The trouble with some case designs (like this one) is they don't have gentle push-to-release mechanisms and it is a struggle to remove the discs without flexing them (which can cause disc damage).  Another problem is that only DISC 1 attempts to fill up the 2 hours of DVD.  The remaining discs waste space (pardon the pun) using only half of each DVD's projected capacity.  With all the Rocky Jones episodes available one way or another, and with over 10 hours capacity on 5 DVD's, why was this not a complete series release?

Unlike the Alpha Video's edited-together movie versions, Passport has the original, individual episodes of Rocky Jones.  Also unlike Alpha Video's static picture menus, each Passport DVD contains artistically impressive ""motion menus"" that show previews of the episodes specific to it's DVD ... and those clips look quite good.  Unfortunately, that is where the quality begins and ends.  Each episode is ""presented"" with scratches and dust, film grain, skips and chops (neither the opening titles nor the closing credits are shown complete), over-blown contrast, and light-dark outlining from multi-generation copying.

It would have been better if Passport put their efforts into higher quality source material and better transfers.  Not making this a ""complete collection"" is puzzling and filling it with empty space and unrelated filler is inexcusable.  As it stands, this is a ""cheap set"" in cost, quality, and execution.

The content of Passport's Rocky Jones collection is:

DISC 1

. Silver Needle in the Sky (3 episodes)

. Bobby's Comet (3 episodes)

DISC 2

. The Forbidden Moon (3 episodes)

DISC 3

. Crash Of The Moons (3 episodes) (misprinted on case as ""Blast Off!"")

. Kip's Private War (single episode)

DISC 4

. Rocky's Odyssey (3 episodes)

DISC 5

. generic sci-fi media

.. ""Missile To The Moon""

.. ""A Century of Sci-Fi: Sci-Fi Heroes""

.. ""Flash Gordon: The Subworld Revenge"" (not Buster Crabbe)

2486507,3,B000E3L7MS,"Watching Rocky Jones Space Ranger brought back memories of watching the show over 40 years ago on a crummy black and white TV set.  The episodes here are transfers from the 16MM film versions of the show, with reel end markings, scratches, and a hazy picture.  In other words, the video quality on this DVD set is non-existent.  Watching one episode on my computer LCD monitor, I saw something new, the right hand side of the print, in the TV overscan area, was missing some of the frame and there was an irregular edge.  Whoever made the telecine transfer just ran the print through the machine, without bothering to align the print.  I stopped watching after the Silver Needle three episodes story arc, because there is a permanent ""bug"" on the video, a logo in the lower right hand corner of the video that identifies it as:

The Rocky Jones

Space Ranger

Collection

I buy DVDs to avoid bugs, so I consider this DVD a waste of money.  Passport Video, the seller of this public domain release, which has had no digital mastering done on the video to improve the quality and uses LPCM 2.0 sound to avoid Dolby royalties, is worried that someone will copy their masterpiece.  Even the DVD case is cheap, cramming 5 DVDs into one case.  I will make it a point to avoid any other releases from Passport Video.",1150588800,26,1309,4.547008547008547
2486508,4,B000E3L7MS,"This would be a great set to have, if you don't own any of the Rocky Jones ""movies"".  But if you do, all of the shows on this set are available in ""movie' format.  I thought it contained show which had not been released as movies, but it doesn't.  Don't waste your money.  If you don't have the ""movie"" versions, it would be a good investment.  But if you own or plan to own the movie versions, don't bother.",1149984000,10,408,4.113924050632911
2486509,5,B000E3L7MS,"Rocky Jones Space Ranger is back in print and fairly inexpensive too. This classic TV early 1950's space opera is filled with cheap sets, poor special effects, annoying sidekicks, and a hero who in one episode actually tells his female crewmate to ""go knit a sweater"" (and she actually does!) when they have a disagreement! It's hilarious early TV ""sci-fi"" suitable for all ages, so you can treat yourself and your kids to a bit of TV history and have a good laugh together. I saw three episodes of this show a few years ago (2 of them on Mystery Science Theater 3000) and they were all loads of fun. This 5-disc 600-minute set is a real bargain for the price.

If you've never seen the show, it's really something. Rocky Jones is a square-jawed fisticuffs wielding spaceship pilot with REALLY goofy sidekicks, including Winky, a young man who acts like a kid, and Bobby, a little kid that acts all grown-up. Then there's VERY short-skirted Vena, his bright female crewmate that gets treated like, well, like women were mostly treated in the US in 1950's TV. Then there's elderly and brilliant Professor Newton, who in spite of being a genius, makes just enough miscalculations to get them into real trouble.

Rocky Jones is a vision of the far future firmly rooted in the early 1950's. They don't make them like this anymore! If you liked Lost In Space, this is sort of an earlier version of that, possibly even goofier, so you might well like this too.",1140998400,27,1454,4.631782945736434
2486510,4,B000E3L7MS,"My fascination with Rocky Jones, Space Ranger began several years ago when I purchased a vhs called ""40 Years of Science Fiction Television"" and they had a small glimpse of Rocky Jones. What stuck in my mind was how much Rocky and Winky reminded me of Professor John Robinson and Major Don West of Lost In Space. Just recently I picked up the infamous 50 Sci Fi Classic Movies box set. And much to my pleasant surprise it has 2 Rocky Jones movies. I think it was like 6 episodes put in compilation form. With these viewings I learned more about this show. Rocky Jones pilots and commands like John Robinson, but negotiates and fights like Captain Kirk as he travels from planet to planet keeping peace and order in the galaxy under the jurisdiction of United Worlds, like Captain Kirk and the Federation. There's the boy Bobby (a precursor to Will Robinson) who seems to spend considerable time with Professor Newton, as did Will with Dr Smith. However Professor Newton was a helpful sort, unlike his comedically nefarious counterpart. And then there is the hottie named Vena who wears a Supergirl type outfit complete with a cute set of legs. I think Irwin Allen had this show in mind when the casting call went out for Lost In Space or maybe it was just a coincidence. For those who do not know, Winky is played by Scotty Beckett, Best known as Spanky's oversized sweater, sideways baseball hat wearing pal. So far what I've seen this show it's whole a lot of fun to watch. And the sets and special effects are not as bad as some reviewers have mentioned on other Rocky Jones Discs. I can't wait for this one.",1140220800,15,1611,4.5395189003436425
8105249,5,B000E3L7MS,"My dad often fondly recalled watching this show as a child, so I decided to surprise him with this DVD set for his 68th birthday.

While it was a kids show, they did try to incorporate real science into the show.  Only complaint is that the video and audio quality is not that great.  Obviously it is many generations removed from the origional film, but it is quite watchable.",1297641600,,393,4.430555555555555

The only problem was the episode from Flash Gordon, the 60's TV sci-fi show.  How can I say this?  That show stank.  It was awful.  It was made in West Germany with supporting actors who had such a heavy Germanic accent that it was hard to understand their English use.

8105257,4,B000E3L7MS,"Passport Video and Koch Entertainment Distribution presents ""THE ROCKY JONES SPACE RANGER COLLECTION"" (2006) --- Finally a collection on one of my favorite series ""Rocky Jones Space Ranger"" was a syndicated science fiction television serial originally broadcast in 1954 --- The show lasted for only one season and quickly dropped into obscurity --- But because it was recorded on film rather than being broadcast live as were most other TV space operas of the day, it has survived in reasonably good condition --- The film format also allowed more elaborate special effects and sets, exterior scenes and much better continuity.

Cast includes:
Richard Crane ...  Rocky Jones (23 episodes, 1954)
 Robert Lyden ...  Bobby (23 episodes, 1954)
 Sally Mansfield ...  Vena Ray (22 episodes, 1954)
 Charles Meredith ...  Secretary of Space Drake (16 episodes, 1954)
 William Hudson ...  Ranger Clark (12 episodes, 1954)
 Scotty Beckett ...  Winky (10 episodes, 1954)
 Jimmy Lydon ...  Biffen 'Biff' Cardoza (10 episodes, 1954)
Maurice Cass ...  Prof. Newton (8 episodes, 1954)

The program was aimed mainly at children, so the plots were simple and always involved good versus evil and Rocky Jones outsmarting or outfighting the bad guys --- By today's standards for television science fiction, a genre that flowered beginning with Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek, the Rocky Jones serials seem crude and simplistic --- But for its time, years before men first journeyed into space, the sets, props, and optical effects were remarkably well done --- Indeed, many of the effects that became standard sci-fi fare, such as the forward view screen and automatically opening doors were seen first on Rocky Jones.

Thirty nine episodes were filmed and shown over the period from April 10, 1954 to January 1, 1955 --- Thirty six of these were grouped into 12 three episode stories, and three were complete in one episode --- Many of the three episode stories were edited into feature length films for television and of those some were renamed as shown below --- Two of the edited movies, Manhunt in Space and Crash of the Moons, were lampooned on the cult hit comedy show Mystery Science Theater 3000.

8105258,4,B000E3L7MS,"Rocky Jones fits somewhere between MGM's classic ""Forbidden Planet"" and Rodenberry's first pilot ""Star Trek: The Cage.""  Consequently, if you are fan of both (or either) of these, then get these discs.  All three of these movies have the same premise, hammered out by Doc Smith in the 1940's:  the intra-galactic space patrol that is endued with plenipotentiary power to establish justice, ensure domestics tranquility--and all that at warp factor 9.

Of course they are corny, primarily because they are geared to pre-teenyboppers boys. In essence, they embody live action comic books, or vintage space opera. But that is what I find Rocky Jones so appealing--no shopworn post-teen angst, no hackneyed anti-heroes with a heart of gold and feet of clay, no grim clitorcentric fantasy with a daily dose of underworld and watered-down ""Macbeth.""

What we are treated to, however, is a great gusto-filled series where Rocky and Co. match wits with menacing forces of galactic evil.  But it is more than that: it is contest of moral fortitude. Behind the ethical choices that Rocky makes--choices that are based on pure intelligence--there is the power that comes from virtuous living.  Rocky Jones is Galahad: ""My strength is as the strength of ten / Because my heart is pure.""

When we understand the empowering ethical framework that Rocky Jones has, we can safely set aside Douglas Adam's sarcasm, ""In those days spirits were brave, the stakes were high, men were real men, women were real women and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri were real small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri.""

Of course Adams had a point, but we need not overstate the point. There is something empowering and enlivening by experiencing Rocky Jones as he stands up for right and civilization.  And that is why we keep watching the same person in the same situation over and over again: The Argonauts, The Round Table, The Baker Street Irregulars, Buck Rodgers, Flash Gordon, The Lensmen, Heinlein's Space Cadets and Starship Troopers who become Citizens of the Galaxy, and the crew of C-57D in ""Forbidden Planet.""  Rocky Jones reaffirms these truths of character, courage, and confidence--familiar ideas that we love.

As Joseph Fielding Smith wrote, ""The truth endures forever. It is always new. It grows brighter with use. We love it the more we come in contact with it, which is not the case with falsehood.""  So buy this DVD to get a piece of history, buy it to see the roots of Star Trek, and buy it to have a virile, rough and tumble, and ethical morality. It is quite an improvement over the run-of-the-mill politics. It will keep your sanity.",1172880000,4,2637,4.965909090909091
