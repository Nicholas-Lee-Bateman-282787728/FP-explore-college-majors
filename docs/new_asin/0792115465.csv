121989,5,0792115465,"This collection contains three of John Wayne's best Westerns at an affordable price.  All three of these movies are spectacular, and include the movie that launched the Duke's career (Stagecoach), one from the height of his popularity (the Searchers), and one of his final masterpieces (the Cowboys).  Each of these movies is moving in its own unique way:
STAGECOACH is the film that brought Wayne and the great director John Ford together.  This is also Wayne's big break into stardom.  He stars as the Ringo Kid, a confirmed killer with a noble heart and the ability to see people for what they truly are, not what they appear to be on the outside.
THE SEARCHERS is the classic story of one man's unrelenting search for his niece.  The Duke's character, Ethan, spends years tracking a band of Indians all over the Southwest in a nearly impossible quest.
THE COWBOYS shows the fatherly side of the Duke.  Wayne stars as an elderly ranchowner who is forced to hire kids for his cattle drive when all the grown men leave the area in search of gold.  Along the way, the Duke teaches them about discipline, hard work, and, ultimately, honor.
This is a great addition to any movie buff's collection, and a must-have for any fan of Westerns in general.",1059696000,18,1247,4.692660550458716
121990,1,0792115465,"These 10 movies in 5 DVDs from Madacy Entertainment are of the poorest quality that you will find.  Most of them look like they are 5th generation copies of VHS tapes that were then copied to DVD.  I was looking forward to adding to my collection of John Wayne DVDs, but I would not keep these if they gave them away.  I will never buy another DVD from Madacy again.",995328000,36,366,4.2
121991,5,0792115465,"The 5 DVD collection of John Wayne rates high in my book. It takes the viewer back not only in the early life of a most notable actor but also in the early years of film making. The 10 movies in this set were all made in  1933 and 1934. Consider that Talkies didn't exist until 1930-31 you have  the rare oportunity to see what highlighted the movies top billing and see  the movies as did the viewing audience saw them at that time.
If you are  expecting the quality of ""The Alamo"" or ""North to  Alaska"" forget it. The technology at the time was pressed one sided,  paper, records that had to be correctly timed to the movie you were  watching. Dolby and surround sound wasn't even heard of.
What you get to  see is John Wayne as the movies earliest ""Singing Cowboy"" billed  as ""Singing Sandy"". These are great if you view them with the  knowledge of how and when they were produced and enjoy seeing how John  Wayne started a career that ended with the United States Mint striking a  special medal simply stating ""John Wayne - American"".",948585600,10,1038,4.37696335078534

This looks like it was recorded off of someone's cheap TV set. There is no quality like a real DVD, from the manufacturer, is. The picture is grainy and lines run, horizontally, through it.
This was a huge disappointment since I had bought it for one of my husband's Valentine presents. We are keeping it because the shipping costs more than it's worth.
Lesson learned not to buy used from people, who don't have 100% feedback.

122034,4,0792115465,"Having read all the negative comments,I thought the hell with it ,I will buy the John Wayne Blu-ray Collection.

Apart from Mclintock which is pan & scan crap,Bad Quality

The old 1930's Westerns are reasonable quality.
No where near top notch,but better than some of the public domain DVD's.

Contains
THE DAWN RIDER
TEXAS TERROR
THE TRAIL BEYOND
THE STAR PACKER
HURRICANE EXPRESS. Feature Version of the old Mascot Serial. Quite nice quality too.

The Westerns are LoneStar Productions ,which no longer exist. So I for one am grateful
to the Distributors for releasing these on Blu-ray.

All in all for the price a good buy.

Its doubtful any film prints have survived,maybe 16mm ones,
These transfers were done in the early 90's
I am watching them on a 64inch Samsung Plasma TV,and they look ok. Nowhere near perfect but OK.

Though OLIVE films have released 4 with another 3 on the way of some of his 40's films ,which are Brilliant Quality.
and much better films than the LoneStar ones.",1353196800,8,991,4.760233918128655

As far as the others are concerned, The Dawn Rider, Texas Terror, The
Trail Beyond, The Star Packer and The Hurricane Express, I've seen much worse. They don't appear to be restored in any way, digitally or otherwise, but the picture isn't too bad at all. In fact they appear to be a little clearer and much brighter than I'm used to seeing. And the sound is about the best I've heard from these old movies, very clear. The music appears to be the original, as opposed to all the other copies I've seen. Usually these old Star Packer films have a terrible title and soundtrack music added to them.
Hey, I only paid 9 bucks delivered so I can't complain too loud. It would be nice if the time was taken to digitally restore these old b-movies though. On the other hand, perhaps they would lose character.",1338854400,2,1064,4.489690721649485
122040,3,0792115465,"I found this on the clearence  rack for a nice price and was kinda disapointed in the disc quality, mostly becouse it contains a 1.33 tranfer of McLintock!, a 2.35 film (most likely an old TV print), also present is a short documentary comprised of Duke trailers, a condensed movie length serial, and four Lone Star cheapies. the PQ no better than DVD quality IMO.
Still being a fan of John Wayne, I do enjoy the disc overall.

Many have been released countless times (McLintock! really comes to mind) as public domain films, and the quality was garbage.
So far, with the limited information floating around, this looks like another one of those low quality garbage releases, and until we get more information, in my opinion, save your cash for now.

Special footnote, John Wayne was an iconic, Academy Award-winning, American film actor. He epitomized ruggedly individualistic masculinity, and has become an enduring American icon. He is famous for his distinctive voice, walk and height --- Beginning in 1928 and extending over the next 35 years, Wayne appeared in more than twenty of John Ford's films, including Stagecoach (1939), She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), The Quiet Man (1952), The Searchers (1956), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). His performance in Stagecoach made him a star --- The Searchers continues to be widely regarded as perhaps Wayne's finest and most complex performance. In 2006 Premiere Magazine ran an industry poll in which his portrayal of Ethan Edwards was rated the 87th greatest performance in film history. He named his youngest son Ethan after the character --- In 1999, the American Film Institute named Wayne thirteenth among the Greatest Male Stars of All Time. A Harris Poll released in 2007 placed Wayne third among America's favorite film stars, the only deceased star on the list and the only one who has appeared on the poll every year.

122058,5,0792115465,"By the 1960s, John Wayne's westerns had become as familiar as a well-worn beloved Stetson, and Wayne, himself, had settled into a patriarchal role that suited both his age and screen presence. This DVD collection offers the Duke in three of his most entertaining films of the period, and is well-worth owning!

""North to Alaska"" (1960), Wayne's follow-up to ""The Alamo"", is a brawling, lusty saga of two Alaskan prospectors (Duke and Stewart Granger), and the reformed prostitute (Capucine), who complicates their lives. Wayne consciously tried to 'broaden' his westerns with this film, introducing more comedy and family-friendly action (culminating in 1963's classic, ""McLintock!""), and, despite being too long, the film has a lot of charm. Worth noting is an excellent cast, including Ernie Kovacs (in one of his last film roles), as the smarmy villain, young Fabian, as Granger's over-sexed younger brother, and Mickey Shaughnessy, hilarious as the 'dim bulb' drunken prospector who becomes a key player in Kovacs' plan to steal the Wayne/Granger goldmine.

Entertaining light fare!

""The Commancheros"" (1961), Wayne's next film after ""North to Alaska"", is even better (and the best of this trilogy), with the Duke, as a crusty Texas Ranger, sharing the screen with an excellent Stuart Whitman, portraying fugitive New Orleans gambler, Paul Regret. The final film directed by legendary Michael Curtiz (with unbilled help by Wayne, as the director was in poor health), the tale is a light-hearted adventure of Duke and Whitman gradually becoming friends, as Wayne attempts to thwart a gun-running scheme involving the notorious band of outlaws of the film's title. Very much a 'family' western (with Wayne's son, Patrick, daughter Aissa, and long-time friend Bruce Cabot, in key roles), the film offers glamorous Ina Balin as Regret's mysterious lover, Nehemiah Persoff as her father, the gregarious leader of the Commancheros, and, best of all, Lee Marvin, in a small but showy role as Tully Crow, a half-breed gunrunner (Marvin's chemistry with Wayne was so potent that John Ford would soon team them in two of his own productions, ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"", and ""Donovan's Reef"").

Great fun, and great Wayne!

The final entry, ""The Undefeated"" (1969), is the weakest of the trilogy, yet offers some very entertaining moments. Filmed after Wayne's bout with lung cancer, he looks far older and more haggard, but still carries a commanding presence, as an ex-Union officer driving a large herd of horses south, forced to team up with an unrepentent Confederate officer (mustached Rock Hudson, in his only film with the Duke), and his wagon train of refugees, hoping to rebuild their fortunes in Mexico. While many of Wayne's friends have roles (Ben Johnson, Harry Carey, Jr., Bruce Cabot, and Pedro Armendariz Jr.), the novelty casting of football stars Roman Gabriel and Merlin Olsen in key roles received the most attention when the film was released (Olsen was surprisingly good, and went on to a successful career on television). Wayne and Hudson are a lot of fun in their scenes together, and the underlying plot (of the Mexican struggle to rid itself of French 'puppet' Emperor Maximilian) never interferes with the broader comic 'edge' of the film. While Wayne looks a bit strange in muttonchop sideburns, all in all, the movie is a last fond look at the Duke's '60s western 'persona'. The westerns of the last decade of his life would be, generally, far darker, and more brutal.

This is certainly a Wayne trilogy worth owning!",1142380800,20,3549,5.1421143847487

It starts with a cattle drive of Herefords (not the longhorn cattle of the mid-19th century). Men ride up shooting pistols to turn the herd. Horses are also driven. Three men make a stand by trees. The rustlers drive off the cattle. In town there is action at ""The Casino"". Tom gives $100 to his cousin and his friend, but this is refused. Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued. Cattle will be driven to the railroad by Dave. Will the rustlers try again? Yes, when there are only two guards.

The cattle arrive in town to be loaded on the railroad for shipment. The cowboys want to celebrate in town. Will Dave play poker? The waiter switches a deck of cards! This lets the professional player win. [A lesson for the audience.] Tom explains his actions to Miss Judy. In town Tom sits in at the poker game and discovers the cold deck! There is a shot, Tom rides off with the money. The gamblers chase them. Will help come in time? Yes. Dave and his partner return to Montana.
