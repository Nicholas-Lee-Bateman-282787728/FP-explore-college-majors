4852331,5,B005OK0YLG,"I can't explain logically why I like Westerns of this kind/period/budget, I just do. It must have sometrhing to do with the fact I saw a lot in the cinema of my youth, and nostalgia does tend to rule my sense of ""good and bad"". So, this is ""Good"", and my thanks to MGM Limited Edition Collection made to order, for this 1960 UA release. A perfect print (picture and sound)(b/w) and a typical Kent/Cahn production. A past his sellby date, but still a terrific Western hero, Buster Crabbe heads the cast (The part could easily have been played by other great stalwarts like James Brown and Jim Davis) as ""Gunslinger Kip"" returning to Abilene at the request of his estranged brother. He obviously meets stiff opposition from among others, Barton Maclane, playing a tough as nails bigtime rancher (""Where were the sodbusters 30 years ago when I took this land and made it mine...etc""), Lee Farr as his son and a strangely cast Richard Devon as his strongarm man. I say strange cos if memory serves, he has no dialogue! Maclane of course can do this role in his sleep, and he always adds gravitas to any part he plays. The love interest, as is often the case in these films, is a bit disapointing. Judith Ames ? I think the jury is still out. Eugenia Paul who has an important role is much the more attractive of the two. Good Western support cast-Russell Thorsen (yes, he is the Marshall who has that wonderful prophetic line I quote at the top), Kenneth McDonald, Arthur Space all add to the mix. I loved this film, but you have to take into account that I am a true fan and my opinion is biased!!! Expensive? Yes, but to me, worth it. I'll finish in an area I find hard to grasp. The Ratio states 16x9 1.66 Side Mattes. It fills my whole wide screen 32"" set. The trailer (the only extra) is 4.3 as it should be shown. It didn't in any way spoil my enjoyment, just thought I should mention it. Highly recomended.",1363651200,5,1909,4.410764872521247

4852337,2,B005OK0YLG,"I guess tis movie was good for its time, but by today's standards, or at least mine, it's comical. Insipid plot, ridiculously poor acting and very poorly done fight and gun play scenes. In one, a ""bad guy"" who's gun was shot out of his hand, grabbed his hand before the shooter's gun was fired! In another, the ""tough guy"" was ""restrained"" to a tree with ropes loosely wrapped around his upper arms. He could easily have drawn and fired his guns. Really inane. OK for kids, I suppose.

Ugh.",1479859200,,490,4.444444444444445
