8216321,3,B00009YAHX,"I got this DVD after seeing his ""Beginning Rock Guitar"" DVD and, this (Rock Rythm) DVD is somewhat easy.  I haven't been playing guitar long myself and the stuff was pretty easy to pick up.  The only complaint I have is that he hardly explains anything that he is doing.  He'll explain a few things like ""The Hendrix Chord"" and things like that.  But like the Blues Riff I have no clue what he's doing I can't see and he doesn't even explain.  So, other than the fact that he doesn't explain much of anything I think it's a great DVD I would recommend this.",1146355200,,557,4.266666666666667
8216322,3,B00009YAHX,"After completing Paul Lidel's beginning blues guitar DVD (which I highly recommend), I decided to move onto this video as the next step.

This video teaches you 10 riffs, one in each different style such as ""hard rock"" and ""blues rock"". The riffs themselves are fun to play, but I really expected a lot more material for the cost.

Paul also sprinkles in some comments about theory, technique, and a few different alternate tunings. This stuff is nice, but again I just would like to have seen more depth. I think the video would have been better if it focused on fewer styles (like hard rock, classic rock, blues rock) in greater depth and left out the not-quite-rock styles such as reggae, funk and new metal. This is a rock rhythm video, right? Again - too much breadth, not enough depth.

In summary, if you like Paul's style and have the cash to spare, I think you will enjoy working through the material on this video. If you are a beginner, you will probably learn a few useful things along the way. The ""classic rock"" riff is especially cool - it will have you sounding like Jimi.",1114560000,4,1088,4.5126903553299496
