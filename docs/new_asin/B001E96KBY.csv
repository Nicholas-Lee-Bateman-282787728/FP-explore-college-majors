8297193,5,B001E96KBY,We love these DVDs!!  My daughter has Down Syndrome and has severe hearing loss.  These DVDs are excellent quality and fun for us to watch and to learn ASL.  The instructor looks like he really enjoys what he does and that helps us to have fun with it.  The videos related to the words are effective and very well done.  We highly recommend these DVDs.,1359331200,,352,4.3538461538461535
8297194,2,B001E96KBY,"I was very disappointed in these videos. I am learning sign language for my son. This video spends WAY too much time on ""field trips"" where no one is signing, you are simply watching video footage of animals.",1305158400,,208,4.5
8297195,1,B001E96KBY,"I can see where this DVD would be great for those who are already proficient in ASL. However, it is NOT a DVD for those hoping to learn ASL. I was extremely dissapointed when after learning a few signs that a beginner probably would not use in a real situation (who asks about the weather when they cannot understand a related reply?) the DVD launches into a trip to the zoo, and while it gives you interesting facts verbally and captioned, it does not teach you a thing in ASL because it is WAY too fast. Wasted my money on this one!",1269820800,3,534,4.245098039215686
8297196,2,B001E96KBY,I was very disappointed in the DVD.  The DVD was more of a sight/sign language trip to the zoo for deaf children.  It had very little instruction on actually learning sign language for hearing folks.,1260489600,2,199,4.6571428571428575
8297197,2,B001E96KBY,"The video starts out well with introductory signs. Then it goes on a virtual field trip to a zoo and there is just a LOT of wasted time at the zoo. I don't have time to waste watching animals. I wanted to learn signing, not being at a zoo and learning the history of the zoo!!!",1253836800,2,277,3.9642857142857144
8297198,5,B001E96KBY,I purchased this DVD set based on reviews given by an ASL interpreter. I have not been disappointed! These DVDs keep the interest of my two young children without sacrificing intellect for the adults. We are able to sit down as a family and learn together. Avery is a wonderful story teller who's clear passion for animals is infectious. I would recommend this product for any family looking to learn ASL.,1227139200,3,405,4.71830985915493
8297199,1,B001E96KBY,"This DVD is better for children and not adults....it seemed to focus more on the zoo and animals from the Zoo.  In actuality it may be a little to fast for kids, I ended up giving my DVD to a woman who had a 2year old. Also there is a song on the DVD, I was under the impression it was a song I could learn....Ha Ha Ha the joke was on me.",1223856000,,338,3.6301369863013697
