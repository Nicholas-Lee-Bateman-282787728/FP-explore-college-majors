3884123,1,B002AFX58C,A disjointed series of weird scenes does  not a film make.  There was not one  human moment  in the whole  movie.  I disliked  every character.,1439251200,2,143,4.48
3884124,5,B002AFX58C,"this is a german film told in four parts, son, dad, mom, and daughter, good entertaining film, i like german films really well",1357776000,2,126,4.521739130434782
3884125,4,B002AFX58C,"A masterful expose on the life of a typical German family.
On the surface everything looks fine for the dad and mom, a son and daughter.
Then a window opens on each individuals life.
The son is gay and is constantly seeking sexual companionship.  The dad is
very self disciplined yet is alone.  The mom struggles with her aging convinced
that she is no longer attractive.  The daughter who is the baby girl for both
mom and dad is an adult that the family discovered her secret, she is pregnant.
Through most of the movie, all is done inside of various buildings, malls, etc.
Only at the end does the son and daughter go outside into the sunny bright day
metaphorically showing that even in trying circumstances there is bright hope.
The movie starts a bit rough, but well worth being patient to see how the producer
and writer expertly weaves threads of the story between the four windows.
Overall a good movie that I am glad that I added to my collection",1345766400,6,956,4.514450867052023
3884126,1,B002AFX58C,"One of the worst films I have ever seen.
No plot, no sense, stupid dialogues.
This one made me almost fall asleep in the middle of the day.",1307750400,4,139,4.0
8359462,3,B002AFX58C,"Actually rather liked this film. It might not be great, but I found it to be a nice slice of life -- even funny in parts. The most glaring flaw for me was in the segment which focused on the mother. Worried about her waning charms, she bares her chest to her son for an evaluation. Surprisingly, the torso reveals she has nothing to worry about -- breasts firm and upright, skin utterly undamaged. This was so not the body of a woman well past middle-age who has borne two children. Did the film-makers not see a discrepancy? Did they use a young woman for a body double? If so, why? Anyway, the film is well worth a look.",1481155200,,622,4.235294117647059

8359466,1,B002AFX58C,"Acting was questionable, and not much of a storyline to follow granted it's in a different language. Very slow beginning and loses the audiences attention real quick.",1457654400,,166,5.185185185185185

8359471,3,B002AFX58C,The idea sounds good - but something was lost in the translation - I did not get what was going on even though I read what was going on.  You may like it - It was okay -,1453593600,,169,3.4473684210526314
