8750453,1,B01BKVTLMK,"As with a lot of Alpha Video DVD-Rs, this one had considerable playback problems. I couldn't watch the Sherlock Holmes episode, or the episode of Armchair Detective. Luckily, both are available on YouTube. The Meet McGraw pilot is available on several other DVDs, so really the only show I was able to watch and enjoy on this DVD was the episode of Front Page Detective. That's hardly worth buying the DVD for, considering all four shows are readily available for free on the net, and in the same or better broadcast condition.",1468800000,,527,4.739130434782608
