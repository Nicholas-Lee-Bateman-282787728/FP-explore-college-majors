3426588,5,B001993Y5O,"I have watched All My Children since 1972 and only missed a few of the shows in that time. Please bring all the shows every bit of them to DVD, I would buy the whole set! Best show ever! If you read the Pine Valley Bulletin website you will see how much this show is missed and how much people want it back so the DVD of the whole show will sell.",1323129600,2,346,3.8194444444444446
3426589,5,B001993Y5O,Please release All My Children on dvd - I would buy the full set and pretend that my favorite show since it began wasn't really cancelled for another cooking show!!  NO price to large!,1322265600,5,184,4.411764705882353
3426590,5,B001993Y5O,"I started watching AMC in 1970. I recognize that not everyone would be interested in the early years, and not everyone would be interested in the later years. So, my suggestion would be to start by offering certain years, such as 1970, 1980, 1990, etc. so that they could judge which decades are going to sell well, and which aren't. Perhaps even start with the ""glory days"", when AMC was always one of the top 3 rated soaps each week. I have to say I likely would not buy anything later than the mid 90s, but I am sure younger people would want the ones that they remember from the 90s and 2000s.",1317945600,2,597,4.292035398230088
3426591,5,B001993Y5O,"Need to release the whole series! Every episode, every second of every show. I would buy two sets, one for me, one for my mother.",1317427200,7,129,4.2
3426592,5,B001993Y5O,"All I want for Christmas is the full-up DVD compilation of all AMC episodes. If I can score this for my wife, we would both be so happy. Someone, please bring it on. Is there a way we can, as a group, urge some entity to get this project going?",1317340800,8,244,3.9
3426593,2,B001993Y5O,"I read somewhere that if they put AMC on DVD, they would have to pick certain parts of the story to use because there was so much air time.  Well, I think that's just silly.  I would buy it all every episode there is, especially since the show is older than me, and there's so much I only partially know.",1316649600,13,304,4.05
3426594,5,B001993Y5O,"I, also have watched this show from the beginning and was shocked when we were told it was being cancelled.  I, along with all soap fans should boycott ABC.  But mostly boycott the shows that are replacing AMC and OLTL.",1315612800,6,219,4.45
3426595,5,B001993Y5O,"I would definitely love to see All My Children released on DVD in it's entirety.
I watched all my life and my daughter has watched all her life. It is an institution that should not be lost.",1307404800,19,190,4.162162162162162

8272737,5,B001993Y5O,I miss this show so much. I would buy and watch from very start to very end. I started watching as a small girl with my mom in the mid 70's and taped it as a teen and watched after school and kept it up until days of DVR. I never missed a show. I boycott the two shows that come I'm in it's time slot. Pls pls abc just release the DVDs already.,1426896000,,344,3.6621621621621623
8272738,5,B001993Y5O,"I am so hoping they will decide to release this soap opera in it's entirety. But, I will gladly take whatever they decide to come up with---but in it's day to day entirety would be the absolute best!!!!  PLEASE!!!!!  THANK-YOU!!!",1407715200,2,229,4.7
8272739,5,B001993Y5O,I hope ABC puts the entire series on DVD. I would be in a long line of fans to buy this on DVD if ABC ever put this and OLTL on DVD,1340323200,2,131,3.125
8272740,4,B001993Y5O,"I watched a few pieces of this show growing up, since my mom and maybe a sister or two of mine watched this show on a regular basis and though it's main audience is woman since it's in the soap opera genre. I still thought the show was pretty good for the most part and would be very interested in watching the very first season at least, since it aired before I was born and I would like to see the original cast back when they were way younger, that is one thing that makes the first season of interest to me anyway and just to see the way the show started out. I also think it's absurd that people in the entertainment industry like network producers and film directors are showing how incredibly stupid they are with statements like ""it would be impossible to release a tv show like this on dvd just because of the fact it ran for an hour 5 days a week for over 40 yrs."" It might take a lot of time to release and effort that apparently none of them want to fork out & I am for them not putting any effort into it if they want to be jerks(a.h.edit) let them be jerks, but at least release it all at once then, hand over the rights to streaming at a bottom dollar price if they don't think they will ever get around to dvd or blu-ray releases which at very least blu-ray is a valid option , since they can inexpensively pack a ton of episodes on a bluray esp if they get the high capacity ones that they have access to the one's consumers can't even buy on writable's. There is plenty of ways they could release this series in it's entire form and provide a ton of fans with what they want as well as make a fortune off of it, so saying it's impossible to do is just absurd and ridiculous. DVD, Blu-Ray, HC memory card, pocket hard drives, streaming (netflix, hulu, amazon prime, etc.), or even their own private streaming system they could easily build a server pc or hire someone to and have the network or film company that owns he rights streaming it direct from where ever it sits in archives to a million tv sets on whatever devices they want to enable and they would be racking in the dollars because just with the one show ppl would pay for memberships to their streaming network and when if they added more shows all the better, if every tv network did that with every show they don't plan on releasing on dvd there would be a ton more network specific streaming and I'd probly buy a membership to each just to watch episodes of shows I love that I know will never get released otherwise there was a ton of comedy sitcoms that I loved that never made it a whole year and I saw maybe 1-2 episodes cuz of my work schedule.",1339286400,2,2632,4.183070866141732
8272741,5,B001993Y5O,They should release dvds by couples. Like make dvd box sets of the complete story of favorite couples throughout AMC history. All their scenes together in one box set. I would by that in a heartbeat.,1334534400,2,199,4.555555555555555
8272742,5,B001993Y5O,"Pleasd, please, I had watched it for 40 yrs! Please release it on video, I would buy every season uncut, no matter what the cost. I miss the thing that defined my ME time 5 days a week for 2/3's of my life!",1333497600,6,206,3.813953488372093
8272743,5,B001993Y5O,"I have been watching ALL MY CHILDREN since '91.  My aunt got me hooked at age 7.  I would tape the show everyday when at school and rush home to finish homework just so I could watch it everyday.  I love the people of Pine Valley, it's stories.  I love getting so wrapped up in the families and the relationships that my mom and sister would just laugh at me.  I would welcome buying the entire show from the beginning.  Even if it meant joining a club for AMC and getting one year released every three months to buy.  Please release this show onto DVD and Let Me Know!!!!!!!!",1333324800,4,576,4.229357798165138
8272744,5,B001993Y5O,PLEASE RELEASE THIS BY THE YEAR. I WILL BE ONE OF THE FIRST 2 BUY! TRUST ME YOU WILL HAVE A HARD TIME KEEPING THEM IN STOCK!,1328400000,3,124,3.6296296296296298
8272745,5,B001993Y5O,"I would love to see a boxed set of AMC from the first episode to the last, and I would gladly plunk down $1500 for the privilege. I started watching in Jr. High and still can't believe that ABC cancelled it. I am proud to say that I have not watched the new ""lifestyle"" show, The Chew, and will not watch the show that is replacing One Life to Live either.",1326672000,2,356,4.028169014084507
8272746,5,B001993Y5O,Really hope that complete seasons of both All My Children and One Life to Live happen!  I would buy one for me and one for my mom so we could watch again!  I need something to fill my time between 1-3pm after January!!!,1323734400,2,219,4.069767441860465
