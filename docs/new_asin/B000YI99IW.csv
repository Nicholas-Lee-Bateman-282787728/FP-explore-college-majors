3029536,5,B000YI99IW,"I didn't buy the first two seasons because I knew they were going to release the seasons and the finale as a single package. When I watched the office on BBC America I purchased season 1 only to have it come out with the special and season 2. I still have the single season and the complete series. Stop whining because HBO is not going to change any of their marketing because of you. If Ricky Gervais comes up with another show I would suggest waiting to buy the show.

The special features tell you Gervais' thinking and why. The first season was a 5 star plus. The second season is more serious and not the absolute lunacy that I so love about Gervais.

Just a heads up: My Season 2 Disc 2 had the same episodes as disc 1, even though the disc art itself states ""episodes 4,5,6 & bonus features."" So if you get this set, check Season 2 Disc 2 immediately. Luckily I had already seen this series, so I was able to skip to the Christmas Special. I am hoping to get a replacement disc from HBO. I'll post an update about my progress. This happens sometimes with these box sets. I've had the same issue with a Fresh Prince box set, Chips box set and Ultimate Superman box set. Luckily WB replaced the Superman disc no problem. However I had to buy a used Fresh Prince and Chips box set.",1421107200,,693,4.2180451127819545

3029564,4,B000YI99IW,"Of the Ricky Gervais stuff this is some of the best. Mostly because of the supporting cast, I think.

Ricky Gervais always seems to punch through the characters he plays, he never seems to become them. (Although I haven't seen Derek.) At least in Extras Ricky's character develops some depth. His co-star, Ashley Jensen, is a real treat, and someone I wish American producers would give a sitcom to (please, though, not Chuck Lorre). The premise of Extras is a goods one, and it's pretty well written. It slogs a bit in parts, but all in all it sort of works, and is worth watching.",1410480000,,582,4.542857142857143

3029578,5,B000YI99IW,I watched this when it aired and wanted to watch it again at my convenience.  Ricky Gervais is hilarious and the stars who made appearances on this series were absolutely fantastic!  I don't know who wouldn't enjoy this series.,1402012800,,227,4.794871794871795
3029579,5,B000YI99IW,I reached beyond my reluctance and bought this and I have to say its at least as good as The Office.  Different format however hes at times an awkward and hilarious somewhat normal person in this who seems to run out of luck.  The cameos are great as well.  I would watch them all over.,1396224000,,286,4.163636363636364
3029580,3,B000YI99IW,"I got this a few weeks ago, thinking it would be pretty funny and all.  From the trailers and previews off of the British series, The Office, Ricky Gervais is really funny.  However  season one was fairly funny, season two wasn't so much.  Again Ricky is pretty funny in other movies he has done.

3029583,5,B000YI99IW,"I rented and watched this whole series first, then had to own it!!!  It's brilliant in a number of ways, if you like Ricky Gervais - my favorite of all his works.  I love all the eccentric and quirky characters, and the celebrity guest spots - their self-mockery is splendid and utterly delightful!  The ""interwoven"" sitcom bits (in brief) is the only annoying part - but then, that's the whole point!!  Just brilliant all the way around - thank God for actors who still put themselves out there on a limb and take chances!  This comedy is outside the box and so refreshingly creative.",1374019200,,585,4.586538461538462

3029602,5,B000YI99IW,"I bought this series without watching it because of how much I enjoyed his other work and I was not disappointed. I actually think it has more heart than The Office and was as funny if not more so. His character is far more likable, anyway. Which is certainly saying something given how disdainful he can be. Overall I really enjoyed this show and I thought it was a great purchase.",1348099200,,382,4.394366197183099
3029603,5,B000YI99IW,One of Ricky Gervais' finest moments. Extras is perfect for any fan who is a fan of Ricky Gervais. Having it in the complete series is amazing! Especially for the price! This is definitely a must buy!,1330214400,,200,4.4324324324324325
3029604,2,B000YI99IW,"This was too depressing to be a good comedy and yet had just enough humor to prevent it from ever being a greek tragedy.

3029626,5,B000YI99IW,"If you're a fan of The Office, then you'll love Extras.  As always, it's amazing how hilarious the situations are without there being any actual laughter.  The tension in some of the situations can only be broken by the viewer's own laughter as any ""corpsing"" is only viewable on the additional features part of the boxed set.  Especially funny guests in my opinion:  Ben Stiller, Kate Winslet and Orlando Bloom.  Also, Steve Merchant is fantastic as Ricky's agent.  Buy it!",1320192000,,474,4.8625
3029627,5,B000YI99IW,One of the best TV series I've ever watched. If you like Gervais's humor as much as I do and awkward situations are your thing then you will enjoy this I promise. Five solid stars.,1301702400,,180,4.171428571428572
3029628,5,B000YI99IW,This is one of the funniest comedy series I have seen. Ricky Gervais is a truly gifted writer and comedian. Kudos to the actors who played outlandish versions of themselves - brilliant!,1295827200,,185,4.8125
3029629,5,B000YI99IW,"I think only a Briton can get away with dwelling on the utter hypocrisy and gray area of being an artist and an artiste, a person with integrity versus a sellout, being a winner and a loser, all at the same time.

Not to be an essentialist, but this kind of comedy of irony, double sidedness, and secret introspection would never be produced in the United States.  It is just much too real, much too truthful, much too painful for American tastes.",1291420800,2,447,4.439024390243903
3029630,5,B000YI99IW,"Ricky Gervais is genius.  If you aren't turned off by awkward situations, then his vein of comedy should suit you.  As with other Gervais-inspired comedies, such as The Office, our protagonist finds himself tied in the webs of lies woven with friends and enemies alike.  Andy Milman, played by Gervais, is an actor struggling to get his big break into Hollywood.  Hungry for fame and fortune, he works as a career extra poking his head into the mise-en-scene as the director yells ""Cut!""  You would think that he would give up.  And at many times, you want him to.",1285632000,2,564,4.646464646464646

3029632,4,B000YI99IW,"This video set is not what I expected. The episodes started out extremely funny, then became mixed funny and ""cringey"" (with many situations where you found yourself peeking out at the TV from behind spread fingers or over the edge of a blanket). Then came a stage where things got so dark I thought about giving up on the series. Finally, with the season finale came a redemption of sorts, tying the whole up together and leaving me very happy that I watched the whole thing. My wife, my son, and I watched the series together (it was a Father's Day present) and agreed that in the end, taken as a whole, the series was very good. The series was also a lot deeper than I expected, and showed a side of Ricky Gervais that I had not seen to date. He's not only funny, but a very good writer and actor.",1277424000,6,800,4.269736842105263
3029633,5,B000YI99IW,"If you are a fan of the Office you should love Extras.
Ricky Gervais is hilarious in this series.
The star cameos are almost as funny as Gervais, some might say they steal the show.
Plus you get to see a cameo of the great K. Dilkington whose head looks like an orange.",1275350400,,269,4.09433962264151

3029657,5,B000YI99IW,"*Before you read anymore of this review, please excuse the corny pun in the title* I was hesitant about watching this series, mainly because I didn't see much of Rickey Gervais' work, but hte work I saw I didn't like that much. But when some of the episodes were on HBO I started to watch. And I started to laugh. The show was very funny. Whether it was the bubbly and eager additude of Andy (Gervais) or the bumbling wit of Maggie (Ugly Betty's Ashley Jensen). As for the DVD itself, the packaging persists of nice artwork in an accessible style. Inside of the package is seasons (or series) one and two and the ""Extra Special"" series finale. Each season contains 6 episodes. Each season features those six episodes on two discs. The quality of the picture is outstanding.  If you are, or were, a fan of the show this purchase is definitely worth it.",1266278400,,851,4.490322580645161

3029659,5,B000YI99IW,"I've watched it through 3 times already. The series is short and hilarious, with the greatest finale I've ever seen in a TV show. As with Gervais's other works, there's a satirical, darker side to the story that makes this my favorite show.",1260057600,2,240,4.604651162790698
3029660,5,B000YI99IW,"Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant write and direct this absolutely brilliant comedy about extras in the movies and the one who makes it on television.

The wit and humor is fast; the satire pungent and on the money. Major stars appear on the episodes playing weird, wacky, outlandish versions of themselves.

Who are Gervais and Merchant? They are the creators of another brilliant British series,""The Office.""

Co-star Ashley Jenson is absolutely fabulous for her wonderful turn as Maggie, the dim witted, lovable best friend of Gervais's character.

Original material throughout. The show actually tells a story worth watching. Talk about great writers, actors, directors --- Gervais and Merchant are a revelation in the usually dull world of sitcoms.",1257984000,4,754,5.364406779661017
3029661,5,B000YI99IW,"Season one is perfect with great A list stars saying things they should not.  The premise is great for comedy and R & S are brilliant.  Season two is a wonderful extension of the story and the dialog is quick.  But the real winner is the finale - on which all sitcom finales should be based and judged against.  How many times can you watch these?  I'd bet more than 30 each.

Please tell me about the scene with the unwanted peer Andy is forced to dine with - the walk through the cemetery is perfect writing and acting.  And the racist test - I show that episode to everyone who comes to my house.",1255305600,,599,4.156521739130435

I'm currently in Australia and the complete series of Extras isn't out here yet, so I ordered from Amazon and in a few weeks I was laughing intensely at Ricki.

3029663,5,B000YI99IW,"The entire series is in this little package, including the series finale, which is probably the best of the bunch.  As far as the show itself is concerned: Often times, a show or talent is brought over from another country and ""Americanized.""  I'm happy to say that this is not the case with Extras.  Nothing is ""dumbed down,"" the humour is unchanged, and Stephen Merchant is a main character!!!  The various star appearances are not just thrown in for ratings, or inserted in the show to plug their latest projects.  Instead, they play caricatures  of themselves, often heightening the public's perceptions of them.  Ben Stiller yells at a child, Kate Winslet gives advice on proper phone sex techniques, and Sir Ian McKellen plays dumb in the most intelligent way possible.",1249948800,2,775,4.915384615384616
3029664,5,B000YI99IW,I think my favorite parts are with Stephen Merchant as the agent. Especially when he tries to answer his cell phone.  I also loved the extra extra of Stephen and Ricky trying to contact Leonardo DeCaprio.,1246233600,,204,4.666666666666667

3029676,5,B000YI99IW,"Comedy that makes you forget you're watching a comedy until boom you're suddenly dying with laughter.  These seasons are amazingly short, like 6 half-hour programs per season for the first two and I haven't seen the finale yet.  The box set is the most sensible option price-wise and if you liked The Office then you will enjoy Extras as well.  Perhaps the characters in The Office were somewhat less annoying than in Extras though.  In Extras it's a toss-up as to who's most annoying - his agent (Stephan Merchant) or Maggie (Ashley Jensen).  The agent is overly idiotic, to the point where it almost seems slapstick - although Merchant seems like a pretty nice guy as himself in interviews.  Maggie is foot-in-mouth ten times over also, and will compete with the agent for getting on your nerves.  Andy Millman (Gervaise) is the silent (or not-so-silent) sufferer of these two fools.  Fortunately the whole program doesn't just revolve around these two (or you'd die of exasperation) and some of the comedy that suddenly evolves out of the typical Gervais-esque 'awkward moments' can be side-splitting.  This is a very entertaining show that is easy to watch.  The fact that it includes famous guest stars is interesting though by no means the only highlight - performances that I found especially funny would have been Kate Winslett and David Bowie.  I will say that the program leaves you feeling that everyone is cheap, shallow, two-faced, petty, corrupt, jaded and stupid.  But it's a laugh, if not a commentary on how shallow (British?) society can be.  Can't wait to see what Gervaise does next.",1243555200,,1603,4.91449814126394

3029679,5,B000YI99IW,"Having recently seen the BBC version of The Office and loving it, a friend recommended I watch this show. Thankfully, Extras doesn't disappoint on any level. It's hilarious, cleverly written, and more importantly dramatic and interesting. Gervais and Merchant have a knack for writing humor for their characters rather than at their expense. They create likeable A-holes who you just can't help rooting for. The series is hilarious from beginning to end with only a few skips here and there, mostly because a few of the celebrities guest starring are obscure to me, an American. It all culminates in an emotional and very meaningful finale. Can't recommend this show enough.",1242259200,,674,5.136363636363637
3029680,4,B000YI99IW,"Don't get me wrong, Extras is incredibly funny and well-written series. But know what you're getting in this set. Each season (there are two seasons total) only has six (6) episodes! Each episode is about 22 minutes long. And yet, the studio, for some odd reason, decided to split the series onto 5 separate discs (3 episodes per disc).

In other words, ""The Complete Series"" means 13 short episodes total. You do get a plethora of special features, however. But if you think you're getting a week-worth of comedy, you're not.

I give it 4 stars, nonetheless, because Gervais is simply brilliant. The dry British humor and all celebrity guests are simply hilarious. I took a star away just because the series is so short and the studio could have saved a bit of plastic by condensing each season to just one disc. Then have a separate disc for special features.",1235433600,45,861,4.695364238410596
3029681,4,B000YI99IW,"Extras is  an amazing show and needed one more season, but for what you get it's amazing and genius and sometimes uncomfortable to watch.",1235433600,,137,4.708333333333333
3029682,4,B000YI99IW,"Extras is hilarious, I would watch them in the order that the BBC aired them since the episode with Kate Winslet is the best. After that the other episodes seem a bit of a letdown. Still laugh outloud funny. Steven Merchant has the best character! Ashley Jenson is awkwardly great!",1235260800,,281,4.64

Extras is so chocked full of hilariously awkward moments that you can't help squirming while you laugh.

Wow! Laugh out loud entertainment! Ricky Gervais is fantastic -- his impeccable timing, phenomenal delivery, and biting wit is a joy to experience. This is the absolute best comedy series I've seen from either side of the Atlantic in the past several years.

So, to those who are slow to warm to the British comedy genre, take heart and get a copy of Extras. Guaranteed to give you a huge laugh. Hilarious!! My only complaint is that I want more!!",1233619200,,681,4.396825396825397

Absolutely brilliant and HILARIOUS.

If you enjoyed the ORIGINAL OFFICE, then this is sure to please.

As for the DVD packaging of the set is concerned however, it's satisfactory at best as it does not exceed any preconceived expectations: if you already own the each of the DVDs seprately, then I suggest not even bothering with this purchase.

You really have to watch it and you will slowly start finding yourself laughing at how hilarious he is and the show itself.

I won't go to into detail on the show itself it must be seen really than to just read someones description of it, which isn't bad but how could you get into anything without trying it for yourself.

Thought it would be hard to imagine Ricky Gervais in any other role than the one he played in Office or even come up with something close to it in quality.

Again a brilliant chaplinesque ability of finding comedy from tragedy, awkward real life situations that seem too close to personal experiences.  The session with the Catholic group, encounters with David bowie and Patrick stewart are hilarious. Thanks goodness the writers Gervais and Merchant stick to their 12 episode limit. This definitely enhances the quality of the series as compared to the multi-season American versions.",1225411200,,798,5.138461538461539

It follows the ups and mostly downs of Andy Millman, a film extra who in season one gets one rejection after another as he slumps off to one audition after another.  In season two finally gets a successful sitcom, only to realize that this sitcom is a critical stinker.  Then he becomes disillusioned with success at the expense of artistic integrity...you get the idea.

Ricky Gervais was great in the Office, and he's great here to.  His writing partner, Stephen Merchant, is also hilarious as his agent.  But one of the gems of this series is the use of guest stars such as Kate Winslet, Patrick Stewart, Clive Owen, Ben Stiller, David Bowie and many others, playing the worst version of themselves.  I have to give these stars credit for being willing to make fun of themselves (or are they?).

3029733,5,B000YI99IW,"Ah, the Brits. No one else can produce so many successful shows with such unlikable main characters. Consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office-The-Complete-Collection-BBC-Edition-First-And-Second-Series-Plus-Special/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office - The Complete Collection BBC Edition (First And Second Series Plus Special)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Adder-The-Complete-Collector-s-Set/dp/B00005A1SX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Adder: The Complete Collector's Set</a>. Neither David Brent nor any of the various Blackadders (with the possible exception of Captain Blackadder), were especially likable, but the shows built around them were very good and very popular.

Enter Ricky Gervais, formerly David Brent, now Andy Millman, would-be TV star. As a character he's very unlikeable and one of those for whom the word ""cringeworthy"" is coined. He's a character who tries very hard to get ahead, but his own lack of ability and confidence really holds him back.

The character is fascinating to watch. He starts out as an extra, or ""background artist"", as he puts it. He wants to be more. He wants to have his own TV show on the BBC, but it's hard to just get speaking lines, and his particular personality traits and skills at self-sabotage only serve to make things worse.

Consider, for example, and episode in which our hero is dating a Catholic woman. He's an atheist himself but is lying to her and saying he's a Catholic. This works reasonably well until her priest starts talking to him and he begins what my friend and I call ""The Millman Slide"", as instead of manning-up and taking responsibility for what he's done, he starts lying even more, and more ineffectively (at one point saying his childhood priest was one Father Michael O'Flatley). Soon he's buried himself so deep he knows there's no point in trying anymore and simply leaves the room. At one point he's talking to David Bowie and his insecurities are so obvious to everyone around him that Bowie makes up a song, on the spot, mocking him (""Depressed and all alone / Fatty takes his own life"").

Along with Andy we have his incompetent agent, several celebrities playing exaggerated versions of themselves and Andy's friend Maggie, who in many ways is the heart of the series. Watching her develop as a character is one of the great joys of the show, particularly in the Christmas episode.

The DVD's have several great extras (or ""bonus material,"" I guess I should call it), including outtakes, behind-the-scenes material and a short film on the efforts of Gervais and his collegue, Stephen Merchant, to get Leonardo DiCaprio onto the series. The only thing that's lacking, actually, is any additional features on the Christmas episode, and that's really too bad. I would've loved an audio commentary.

This is an excellent series available on Amazon at an amazing price. You get all twelve episodes plus the Christmas special, and I highly recommend buying it as a set rather than just getting the discs on their own. You'll save money this way.

If you have any interest in Hollywood, the movies, television or the entertainment world in general, you owe it to yourself to watch this show!",1216339200,6,3310,5.542574257425742

3029753,5,B000YI99IW,"A few years back, Ricky Gervais created ""The Office,"" a Dilberty satire on office work. Now, he's created ""Extras,"" a wickedly funny satire on showbiz and acting, both seasons of which are contained here. And the fact that prominent actors appear in it -- as warped versions of themselves -- is just the icing on the comedy cake.

Andy Millman (Gervais) and Maggie Jacobs (Ashley Jenson) are film extras -- Andy is embittered by his lack of success and his inept agent (Stephen Merchant, Gervais' work partner), while well-meaning Maggie merely pursues a series of crew members on the films they work in.

The first episode features the two working in a biopic directed by a brusque Ben Stiller (""Would you stop going on about your f**king dead wife?""), and Andy gets himself kicked off the set. Their blunders continue with other stars: Kate Winslet in a nun costume, who teaches Maggie how to talk dirty to her new boyfriend (""I'd love it if you stuck your Willy Wonka in between my Oompa-Loompas!""); Samuel L. Jackson, and Patrick Stewart, who is writing a movie about psychkinesis and naked women.

And in the second season, Andy gets his Big Break -- BBC2 is producing his sitcom ""When the Whistle Blows,"" but they dumb it down until it's popular but critically lambasted. Meanwhile, he and Maggie tangle with a bunch of new celebs -- the arrogant woman-chasing Daniel Radcliffe and Orlando Bloom, self-promoting Chris Martin, a hostile David Bowie, and Andy even stars in a play of Ian McKellen's about gay love (much to his discomfort).

Finally, the Christmas special takes us forward -- Andy has fame and fortune from his sitcom, and Maggie is still struggling at the lowest rungs. When Andy blows up and destroys his own fame, he is forced to confront the fact that he cannot be both an ""artiste"" and rich'n'famous.... and also who his true friends will always be.

It's a bit depressing compared to the past two seasons, especially when Andy has turned into a big stupid sitcom diva. But it is funny in an understated way, and Gervais' televised monologue is an absolute, heartbreaking gem.

Part of the genius of ""Extras"" is that it isn't much like any other showbiz parodies -- the lead characters are on the lowest rung of acting, and the big egos are real stars making fun of themselves. Sometimes they play really nasty versions of themselves, such as Winslet saying that she's only making a Holocaust film so she can FINALLY nab an Oscar.

The other half of the comic genius is Gervais' direction, with most of the jokes based on socially awkward situations. It's all about cringing and giggling at once, such as when Andy's pals see him pantsless in Ian McKellen's dressing room. Those hideously embarrassing situations -- usually with some hilarious dialogue involving the star guests (Bowie's ""little fat man/nobody's laughing"" song is a gutsplitter) are what it's all about.

Gervais underplays a sort of befuddled, cynical extra, but you can really connect with his struggles, even when he gets his own sitcom. No matter what, Andy can always be depended on to jam foot in mouth, and occasionally to attack Warwick Davis.

Ricky Gervais always seems to punch through the characters he plays, he never seems to become them. (Although I haven't seen Derek.) At least in Extras Ricky's character develops some depth. His co-star, Ashley Jensen, is a real treat, and someone I wish American producers would give a sitcom to (please, though, not Chuck Lorre). The premise of Extras is a goods one, and it's pretty well written. It slogs a bit in parts, but all in all it sort of works, and is worth watching.",1410480000,,582,4.542857142857143

As with other Gervais-inspired comedies, such as The Office, our protagonist finds himself tied in the webs of lies woven with friends and enemies alike.  Andy Milman, played by Gervais, is an actor struggling to get his big break into Hollywood.  Hungry for fame and fortune, he works as a career extra poking his head into the mise-en-scene as the director yells ""Cut!""  You would think that he would give up.

Finally, with the season finale came a redemption of sorts, tying the whole up together and leaving me very happy that I watched the whole thing. My wife, my son, and I watched the series together (it was a Father's Day present) and agreed that in the end, taken as a whole, the series was very good.

Whether it was the bubbly and eager additude of Andy (Gervais) or the bumbling wit of Maggie (Ugly Betty's Ashley Jensen). As for the DVD itself, the packaging persists of nice artwork in an accessible style. Inside of the package is seasons (or series) one and two and the ""Extra Special"" series finale.

The wit and humor is fast; the satire pungent and on the money. Major stars appear on the episodes playing weird, wacky, outlandish versions of themselves.

Who are Gervais and Merchant? They are the creators of another brilliant British series,""The Office.""

Co-star Ashley Jenson is absolutely fabulous for her wonderful turn as Maggie, the dim witted, lovable best friend of Gervais's character.

Original material throughout. The show actually tells a story worth watching. Talk about great writers, actors, directors --- Gervais and Merchant are a revelation in the usually dull world of sitcoms.",1257984000,4,754,5.364406779661017

How many times can you watch these?  I'd bet more than 30 each.

Nothing is ""dumbed down,"" the humour is unchanged, and Stephen Merchant is a main character!!!  The various star appearances are not just thrown in for ratings, or inserted in the show to plug their latest projects.  Instead, they play caricatures  of themselves, often heightening the public's perceptions of them.

3264173,5,B000YI99IW,"Comedy that makes you forget you're watching a comedy until boom you're suddenly dying with laughter.  These seasons are amazingly short, like 6 half-hour programs per season for the first two and I haven't seen the finale yet.  The box set is the most sensible option price-wise and if you liked The Office then you will enjoy Extras as well.  Perhaps the characters in The Office were somewhat less annoying than in Extras though.  In Extras it's a toss-up as to who's most annoying - his agent (Stephan Merchant) or Maggie (Ashley Jensen).  The agent is overly idiotic, to the point where it almost seems slapstick - although Merchant seems like a pretty nice guy as himself in interviews.  Maggie is foot-in-mouth ten times over also, and will compete with the agent for getting on your nerves.  Andy Millman (Gervaise) is the silent (or not-so-silent) sufferer of these two fools.  Fortunately the whole program doesn't just revolve around these two (or you'd die of exasperation) and some of the comedy that suddenly evolves out of the typical Gervais-esque 'awkward moments' can be side-splitting.  This is a very entertaining show that is easy to watch.  The fact that it includes famous guest stars is interesting though by no means the only highlight - performances that I found especially funny would have been Kate Winslett and David Bowie.  I will say that the program leaves you feeling that everyone is cheap, shallow, two-faced, petty, corrupt, jaded and stupid.  But it's a laugh, if not a commentary on how shallow (British?) society can be.  Can't wait to see what Gervaise does next.",1243555200,,1603,4.91449814126394

It's hilarious, cleverly written, and more importantly dramatic and interesting. Gervais and Merchant have a knack for writing humor for their characters rather than at their expense. They create likeable A-holes who you just can't help rooting for. The series is hilarious from beginning to end with only a few skips here and there, mostly because a few of the celebrities guest starring are obscure to me, an American. It all culminates in an emotional and very meaningful finale. Can't recommend this show enough.",1242259200,,674,5.136363636363637
3264177,4,B000YI99IW,"Don't get me wrong, Extras is incredibly funny and well-written series. But know what you're getting in this set. Each season (there are two seasons total) only has six (6) episodes! Each episode is about 22 minutes long. And yet, the studio, for some odd reason, decided to split the series onto 5 separate discs (3 episodes per disc).

In other words, ""The Complete Series"" means 13 short episodes total. You do get a plethora of special features, however. But if you think you're getting a week-worth of comedy, you're not.

I give it 4 stars, nonetheless, because Gervais is simply brilliant. The dry British humor and all celebrity guests are simply hilarious. I took a star away just because the series is so short and the studio could have saved a bit of plastic by condensing each season to just one disc. Then have a separate disc for special features.",1235433600,45,861,4.695364238410596

Wow! Laugh out loud entertainment! Ricky Gervais is fantastic -- his impeccable timing, phenomenal delivery, and biting wit is a joy to experience. This is the absolute best comedy series I've seen from either side of the Atlantic in the past several years.

So, to those who are slow to warm to the British comedy genre, take heart and get a copy of Extras. Guaranteed to give you a huge laugh. Hilarious!! My only complaint is that I want more!!",1233619200,,681,4.396825396825397

Absolutely brilliant and HILARIOUS.

If you enjoyed the ORIGINAL OFFICE, then this is sure to please.

As for the DVD packaging of the set is concerned however, it's satisfactory at best as it does not exceed any preconceived expectations: if you already own the each of the DVDs seprately, then I suggest not even bothering with this purchase.

In terms of the product itself, the complete set of Extras makes my collection of TV shows on dvd so much better. Not only are the episodes themselves absolutely classic, but the extra content (bloopers, interviews, etc.) is great.

You really have to watch it and you will slowly start finding yourself laughing at how hilarious he is and the show itself.

I won't go to into detail on the show itself it must be seen really than to just read someones description of it, which isn't bad but how could you get into anything without trying it for yourself.

 This show along with the ""The Office"" which I both own now have to be the two most original and funniest sitcoms to come out in a very long time.

Thought it would be hard to imagine Ricky Gervais in any other role than the one he played in Office or even come up with something close to it in quality. Extras completely surpassed my expectations. In a way it continues from where Ricky left in Office, as an aspiring entertainer but only finding himself the role of extras in movie sets. Again a brilliant chaplinesque ability of finding comedy from tragedy, awkward real life situations that seem too close to personal experiences.  The session with the Catholic group, encounters with David bowie and Patrick stewart are hilarious. Thanks goodness the writers Gervais and Merchant stick to their 12 episode limit. This definitely enhances the quality of the series as compared to the multi-season American versions.",1225411200,,798,5.138461538461539
3264222,5,B000YI99IW,"What's so great about Extras?  Besides the day-to-day realism of the show itself and the natural affect of the characters, the show is flipping funny!  It follows the ups and mostly downs of Andy Millman, a film extra who in season one gets one rejection after another as he slumps off to one audition after another.  In season two finally gets a successful sitcom, only to realize that this sitcom is a critical stinker.  Then he becomes disillusioned with success at the expense of artistic integrity...you get the idea.

Ricky Gervais was great in the Office, and he's great here to.  His writing partner, Stephen Merchant, is also hilarious as his agent.  But one of the gems of this series is the use of guest stars such as Kate Winslet, Patrick Stewart, Clive Owen, Ben Stiller, David Bowie and many others, playing the worst version of themselves.  I have to give these stars credit for being willing to make fun of themselves (or are they?).

3264230,5,B000YI99IW,"Ah, the Brits. No one else can produce so many successful shows with such unlikable main characters. Consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Office-The-Complete-Collection-BBC-Edition-First-And-Second-Series-Plus-Special/dp/B0002W4P98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Office - The Complete Collection BBC Edition (First And Second Series Plus Special)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Adder-The-Complete-Collector-s-Set/dp/B00005A1SX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Adder: The Complete Collector's Set</a>. Neither David Brent nor any of the various Blackadders (with the possible exception of Captain Blackadder), were especially likable, but the shows built around them were very good and very popular.

Enter Ricky Gervais, formerly David Brent, now Andy Millman, would-be TV star. As a character he's very unlikeable and one of those for whom the word ""cringeworthy"" is coined. He's a character who tries very hard to get ahead, but his own lack of ability and confidence really holds him back.

The character is fascinating to watch. He starts out as an extra, or ""background artist"", as he puts it. He wants to be more. He wants to have his own TV show on the BBC, but it's hard to just get speaking lines, and his particular personality traits and skills at self-sabotage only serve to make things worse.

Consider, for example, and episode in which our hero is dating a Catholic woman. He's an atheist himself but is lying to her and saying he's a Catholic. This works reasonably well until her priest starts talking to him and he begins what my friend and I call ""The Millman Slide"", as instead of manning-up and taking responsibility for what he's done, he starts lying even more, and more ineffectively (at one point saying his childhood priest was one Father Michael O'Flatley). Soon he's buried himself so deep he knows there's no point in trying anymore and simply leaves the room. At one point he's talking to David Bowie and his insecurities are so obvious to everyone around him that Bowie makes up a song, on the spot, mocking him (""Depressed and all alone / Fatty takes his own life"").

Along with Andy we have his incompetent agent, several celebrities playing exaggerated versions of themselves and Andy's friend Maggie, who in many ways is the heart of the series. Watching her develop as a character is one of the great joys of the show, particularly in the Christmas episode.

The DVD's have several great extras (or ""bonus material,"" I guess I should call it), including outtakes, behind-the-scenes material and a short film on the efforts of Gervais and his collegue, Stephen Merchant, to get Leonardo DiCaprio onto the series. The only thing that's lacking, actually, is any additional features on the Christmas episode, and that's really too bad. I would've loved an audio commentary.

This is an excellent series available on Amazon at an amazing price. You get all twelve episodes plus the Christmas special, and I highly recommend buying it as a set rather than just getting the discs on their own. You'll save money this way.

If you have any interest in Hollywood, the movies, television or the entertainment world in general, you owe it to yourself to watch this show!",1216339200,6,3310,5.542574257425742

3264250,5,B000YI99IW,"A few years back, Ricky Gervais created ""The Office,"" a Dilberty satire on office work. Now, he's created ""Extras,"" a wickedly funny satire on showbiz and acting, both seasons of which are contained here. And the fact that prominent actors appear in it -- as warped versions of themselves -- is just the icing on the comedy cake.

Andy Millman (Gervais) and Maggie Jacobs (Ashley Jenson) are film extras -- Andy is embittered by his lack of success and his inept agent (Stephen Merchant, Gervais' work partner), while well-meaning Maggie merely pursues a series of crew members on the films they work in.

The first episode features the two working in a biopic directed by a brusque Ben Stiller (""Would you stop going on about your f**king dead wife?""), and Andy gets himself kicked off the set. Their blunders continue with other stars: Kate Winslet in a nun costume, who teaches Maggie how to talk dirty to her new boyfriend (""I'd love it if you stuck your Willy Wonka in between my Oompa-Loompas!""); Samuel L. Jackson, and Patrick Stewart, who is writing a movie about psychkinesis and naked women.

And in the second season, Andy gets his Big Break -- BBC2 is producing his sitcom ""When the Whistle Blows,"" but they dumb it down until it's popular but critically lambasted. Meanwhile, he and Maggie tangle with a bunch of new celebs -- the arrogant woman-chasing Daniel Radcliffe and Orlando Bloom, self-promoting Chris Martin, a hostile David Bowie, and Andy even stars in a play of Ian McKellen's about gay love (much to his discomfort).

Finally, the Christmas special takes us forward -- Andy has fame and fortune from his sitcom, and Maggie is still struggling at the lowest rungs. When Andy blows up and destroys his own fame, he is forced to confront the fact that he cannot be both an ""artiste"" and rich'n'famous.... and also who his true friends will always be.

It's a bit depressing compared to the past two seasons, especially when Andy has turned into a big stupid sitcom diva. But it is funny in an understated way, and Gervais' televised monologue is an absolute, heartbreaking gem.

Part of the genius of ""Extras"" is that it isn't much like any other showbiz parodies -- the lead characters are on the lowest rung of acting, and the big egos are real stars making fun of themselves. Sometimes they play really nasty versions of themselves, such as Winslet saying that she's only making a Holocaust film so she can FINALLY nab an Oscar.

The other half of the comic genius is Gervais' direction, with most of the jokes based on socially awkward situations. It's all about cringing and giggling at once, such as when Andy's pals see him pantsless in Ian McKellen's dressing room. Those hideously embarrassing situations -- usually with some hilarious dialogue involving the star guests (Bowie's ""little fat man/nobody's laughing"" song is a gutsplitter) are what it's all about.

Gervais underplays a sort of befuddled, cynical extra, but you can really connect with his struggles, even when he gets his own sitcom. No matter what, Andy can always be depended on to jam foot in mouth, and occasionally to attack Warwick Davis. And Jensen is clumsily charming as Maggie, who tries to be nice to everyone but says all the wrong things at the wrong time, when she's not being pursued by Orlando Bloom or offending Samuel Jackson.

From start to finish, ""Extras"" is an uproariously funny, barbed looks at the strange world of showbiz, with the self-parodying actors as the final perfect touch.",1197849600,90,3506,4.839732888146911

8232905,3,B000YI99IW,"I'll start by saying I think Ricky Gervais is a brilliant guy and one of the funniest people in the world; I loved ""The Office"" and all of his work with Karl Pilkington, and find his podcast to be sublime. Having said all that, I'm not honestly all that keen on ""Extras"". This box set has each of the six-episode seasons and the longer finale.

I don't want to give away the plot, but can safely say that the arc of the series is that Andy Millman (Gervais) and his friend Maggie (Ashley Jensen) are employed as film extras. Andy desperately wants fame and fortune and ultimately gets a terrible sitcom that he hates. Fame makes him nastier and nastier (the finale has some brutal moments) and shows how low he's willing to go to attain his goal. The resolution of the finale was, by far, the highlight of the show, though I won't divulge it here. I loved Stephen Merchant as Darren, Andy's utterly incompetent agent (and part time cellphone salesman), and many of the most cringeworthy moments (unsurprisingly) hinge on Merchant and Gervais interacting. The show also contains a ton of celebrity cameos, most of which I couldn't care less about (I did love David Bowie and Samuel L. Jackson, though) but it provided a unique angle for the show and did provide some comic relief. That brings me to my issue with the show: Ashley Jensen absolutely steals the show. Her acting and character are better and more likeable than Andy, and while that may seem a trivial point as Andy is supposed to be a bit of a jerk (a formula Gervais excels at), I found Gervais never really became the character of Andy and was wooden compared to Jensen and Merchant. What I'm saying is it's not that I disliked the character of Andy, I just didn't think Gervais owned it like he needed to, especially in season two.

If you like Ricky Gervais and his off-putting characterizations, you'll like ""Extras"". There were moments I loved, but on balance I found much of it to be extremely repetitive (and I understand tedium as a theme) and frankly boring. The standout here is definitely Ashley Jensen, and I hope to see her in more things in the future; based on her performance alone I recommend ""Extras"".

The DVD package has numerous extras (no pun intended) including behind the scenes documentaries, outtakes and deleted scenes. It is a very nice package at a very good price.",1497484800,,2357,4.620525059665871
8232906,5,B000YI99IW,"I don't like Ricky Gervais but I liked him in this series from Britain, which I saw on Netflix. Gervais (Andy Millman) and his dimwitted friend Maggie (who has incurable foot-in-mouth disease) are extras in one movie after another, desperately hoping to be given a line so that he can speak in a movie and be considered a real actor. He also wants respectability and wants to do quality work.

Anyway, there is a strict, callous, pecking order in the acting career and extras are at the bottom. They are ignored, exploited, insulted, taken for granted. Real A-list actors and actresses make cameo appearances in the series, playing themselves, as we go from one episode after another where the Millman and Maggie are extras. To make things worse, Millmans agent is an absolute cretin.

He finally gets a big break in that the BBC wants to produce a sitcom that hes written, but right away, changes are made to his concept. The results are popular and very profitable, but the quality is mediocre, so hes not entirely happy. To make things worse, he begins to act like the callous, insensitive celebrity that he had to put up with, so that toward the end, the comedy (""Extras"") starts to be a downer. In short, this series is a presentation of a pattern that is commonplace in the acting business.

One big plus: no laugh tracks.",1494028800,,1328,4.666666666666667
