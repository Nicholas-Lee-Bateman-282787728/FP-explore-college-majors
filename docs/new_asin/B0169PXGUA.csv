7464515,2,B0169PXGUA,"Sorry to rain on your parade, but if this dvd is true to the comic book, it will be a dud. As with much of Alan Moore's writing it starts out with a bang and grinds to a whimper (Watchmen anyone?). Unless they've changed the ending, this will be a disappointment.",1458777600,7,263,4.176470588235294

7464520,5,B0169PXGUA,"What's not to like? Kevin Conroy is voicing Batman and Mark Hamill is voicing The Joker. Plus, it's an adaptation of one of the greatest Batman stories of all time and the be-all, end-all Joker origin stories written by Alan Moore. The book is also extremely dark and violent and DC also permitted this movie to be rated R, so another bonus right there. And the best part is that it's a DC animated film. DC is known for their animated shows, Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, Justice League, JL Unlimited, Teen Titans, Young Justice, etc. (I don't want to start a flame war, but DC is so much better than Marvel when it comes to animated films/shows) So I do not expect it to be a flop.

As soon as I heard that Bruce Timm is heading the film, and Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker respectively, I knew it would be a must own.  Plus, this could be the last time Kevin Conroy voices Batman and Mark Hamill voices Joker, since they have both talked about retiring from the roles lately.",1447200000,73,416,4.608108108108108

It goes into detail on how the joker mind works. And not to spoil the story but its rated R for a reason. Becuse to go into the Jokers mind is a twisted individual,1515369600,,309,3.9206349206349205

7464555,2,B0169PXGUA,Should have been a short story in an anthology like Superman/Shazam. Then the film makers could have stuck to the source material instead of resorting to the awful batgirl romance/ mob sub plot.,1512691200,,194,4.909090909090909
7464556,3,B0169PXGUA,"A lot of reviewers have commented that this feels like two different movies.  On the surface that is true, but I think the actual problem here is that is an incomplete movie.  It actually needed a third segment that ties the first two together.  It's an okay Batman movie, but could have been a great Batgirl/Oracle movie.

In the first segment, we get the backstory on why Barbara gives up being Batgirl.  It also establishes that the relationship between her and Bruce was becoming much more personal as well as her affinity to computers.  The second segment then starts with a sad and ironic twist.  As Batgirl, she survived all sorts of encounters with dangerous villains without major harm.  It is as a civilian that she suffers the most devastating injury of her life. This leads into the Joker/Batman/Gordon centric story and where this movie ends.

Now, imagine the logical third segment.  Barbara begins a very long road to recovery.  On the surface, Bruce is there for her, but actually pulls away even more since he blames himself for not stopping Joker earlier.  This actually is a good thing since the injury brings Dick back into her life.  Throughout all of that, we see her come to the realization that there is a new role fighting crime for her, just not in the manner she expected.  The movie then ends with her fully embracing the Oracle role.

To me, that would have a much more complete and satisfying story, and kept it pretty much in-line with the comic continuity....  I think....  DC has so many alternate timelines and worlds that I don't even try to keep up anymore.",1512000000,,1593,4.672661870503597

7464575,2,B0169PXGUA,"A nearly unwatchable first act kills this before the classic storyline can even be introduced. While aspects of Batgirls treatment offended or upset a lot of people, truthfully what struck me was how bland and uninteresting her antagonist was.

7464579,4,B0169PXGUA,"I was already on board based solely on the voice cast; they didn't disappoint. I can relate to fans nonplussed by the add-on at the beginning with Batgirl, but it didn't wholly diminish my enjoyment of the main event, which draws straight from the source comic. Fantastic art and sound design, perhaps not as iconic and enduring as the original series or comic, but certainly worth a place on the shelf for anyone who loved the Animated Series or the comic.",1502582400,,457,4.654320987654321

It has the charm and grace that Bruce Timm brought to the small screen nearly 20 years ago. The movie also provides an additional story line to The Joker and Batgirl.

7464594,3,B0169PXGUA,"There are in essence three plots in this graphic film. Each is disconnected from the other. The first is about Batgirl who is in love with Batman who prefers not to have her in difficult situations because he loves her too, although he does not show it. Batman is injured and is lying almost unconscious and Batgirl has sex with him. Batman tells her she may come to a situation where she almost loses herself. She does when she beats up a man, nearly killing him. She decides to give up her role as Batgirl.
The second plot happens when she is still Batgirl. A sociopath kills his boss and takes over the crime ring. He falls in love with Batgirl and wants her.
The third plot is when the Joker escapes from prison and tries to prove that not only him, but all people can become crazy if things really go bad. He tries to prove his point by kidnapping the Commissioner and trying to drive him mad. During the kidnapping he shoots the now retired Batgirl in the stomach and rapes her.",1498694400,,984,4.353260869565218

Bruce is just WAY too old for Babs and it was kinda gross that they took it there when it wasn't a part of the original story.  I guess before long they'll take Bruce Wayne and Grayson where the two BFF's have never gone before.,1498608000,,319,4.19672131147541
7464596,4,B0169PXGUA,"Batman: the Killing Joke is the Animated adaptation to Alan Moores famous novel and after years of fans wanting it we finally get a killing joke animated movie.

I own and read the killing joke and it was one of the best graphic novels short and sweet. So length was a problem as the book isn't that long. So DC decided to add 30 minutes of Batgirl filler that add nothing to the story and ruined it for some fans of the killing joke. It was padding to make the story longer and it didn't really need to be there and it's pretty average. Batgirl teams up with Batman to bring down a mob boss named Paris France. Then there's the scene where Barbara and Bruce have sex on a rooftop in a controversial move that once again has nothing to do with the original source material. Im just going to say that the batsex was not a big deal ive seen people called it incest even though Batgirl and Batman aren't related and their adults. Its not like it hasn't happened before it was explored in the Batman Beyond 2.0 comics. So there was an overreaction. However once again it was unnecessary I didn't mind but once agian did it add to the original story? Nope. First 30 minutes are awful and shouldnt have been included.

Thankful after Batgirl this is not the killing joke ends we get the original story in all it glory exploring the jokers origins, Batgirl getting shot, and the jokers carnival. Its great stuff. The art and animation go from good to bad but this is a direct to dvd release so it didn't have the highest budget.

Batman the Killing Joke should have been a masterpiece a walk in the park. But since Flashpoint Paradox DCs animations have been really on the decline. The only good movies I enjoyed were Justice League Battle of Atlantis, Justice League Dark and Batman Assault on Arkham. The rest have been mediocre or disappointing and Batman the killing Joke was not bad but it could have been better. I do at the end ultimately recommend it as its the killing joke its very hard to be awful when its based on one of the best comic books ever, but just beware of the first half of the movie. As Batman the killing joke is two movies a mediocre Batgirl movie and a good killing joke movie.",1497657600,2,2198,4.36919315403423

7464599,4,B0169PXGUA,"Although The Killing Joke starts off with a story-line that has nothing to do with the original comic, when it actually starts its basically a frame-by-frame representation. It might be disappointing for some to see this Batgirl story thrown at us with terrible dialogue, but the fact is that the actual Killing Joke works great! Watching this comic book come to life is simply awesome, specially with the voice of Mark Hamill as the Joker. The controversy of a lacking experience is just based on that first part of the movie... but the rest of it is what makes it good.

7464620,3,B0169PXGUA,"Once again, Bruce Timm reaches a landmark in his work. Much like his triumph with 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' it was time to return to the Batman lore and make a new film based on another classic Batman story.

With Kevin Conroy, Tara Strong and the great Mark Hamill returning to voice their iconic characters we receive Batman:The Killing Joke. Of course, based on the infamous dark graphic novel and the very first of the DCU films to be given an R rating. Hearing that I knew that this was going to be very close to the novel as it is a haunting and uncomforting take on these legendary characters however, it is also a very poetic and almost Shakespearean look at them which can make it very challenging to adapt it to film. Also, with the novel being so short an entire prologue revolving around Batgirl was created that made a great many fans of Batman and Bruce Timm not enjoy this adaption.

I feel that this film is OK because I admire the fact that this team did the very best that they could have done to bring this story to life. It is not a very action packed story rather, it is very dialogue driven and from what we have seen in previous animated Batman films it is one that is more artsy and thought provoking. The prologue really stands out but, not in a positive way because it just seems way too dumbed down and angsty for a character that we all know to be much more mature. Because of the poor story and dialogue it definitely takes the film down a few pegs.

Once again to the film's credit it was interesting to see a film based on a book that is just so different and I believe that Warner Bros. and DC will take a lot away from The Killing Joke and give us more rated R DCU films in the future. In the meantime I will applaud them and give them an A for effort.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Delve into the demented history of The Dark Knights arch nemesis The Joker as he sets out to prove insanity is only a horrifying moment away for anyone in the latest DC Universe Original Movie, BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE [2016] is based on one of the best-selling graphic novels of all time by Alan Moore and illustrated by Brian Bolland, and this R-rated, feature-length animated film brings together some of the key creative team behind Batman: The Animated Series with executive producer Bruce Timm at the helm and Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill returning to their seminal roles as Batman and The Joker, respectively and produced by Warner Bros. Animation and DC Entertainment, BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE has finally arrived from Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on the awesome Blu-ray format.

BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE [2016] Here we find The Joker, years later, and now escaped from Arkham Asylum, The Joker devises a plan to prove that one bad day can make anyone as insane as he is and setting his sights on Commissioner Gordon. Its up to the Dark Knight to put a stop to The Jokers latest scheme and save one of Gotham Citys finest. Following a gripping prologue introducing Barbara Gordons heroic adventures alongside Batman as Batgirl, BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE stays true to the authentic tale that has held fans imaginations for nearly three decades and spotlighting the birth of a Super-Villain, the fortitude of a Super Hero and the punchline that will leave you speechless.

When it comes to adapting iconic and fan-favourite graphic novels or comic book storylines, expectations can be high, especially when it comes to such renowned characters like Batman and The Joker. Batman: The Killing Joke is undoubtedly one of the most famous and controversial graphic novels ever written, forever altering the status quo of Gotham Citys heroes. The animated film had a lot to live up to and with Batman and Joker voice veterans Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill it certainly does entertain. That said, however, even they're not enough to elevate this film to become something truly great.

A lot of the problem with The Killing Jokes adaptation lies in the first portion of the film. The story itself was too short to turn into a full-length animated film, so writer Brian Azzarello and producer Bruce Timm decided to add an original story following Batgirl as the first act. Batgirls adventure started well, but petered off due to some bizarre choices with Batgirls characterization, specifically her sexual tension-filled relationship with Batman. While some writers have added a romantic element to their relationship in the past, namely in Batman Beyond, the way it was done here reduced Batgirl to a crime fighter seemingly defined by her infatuation with her mentor.

There was part of this story that did work thematically at least. Batgirls adventure led her to chase an out of control mobster who was growing increasingly obsessed with her. Batman tried impressing upon her the importance of not letting a criminal grow that obsessed, vaguely alluding to his relationship with Joker. It was a very important theme that set up the actual Killing Joke portion of the film, yet this served Batmans arc more than it did Batgirls. While she had some cool sequences, and Tara Strong once again performed her very well, Batgirls character ultimately didn't get serviced very well at all. Nor does it serve Batman either as it somewhat turns his fight against Joker into a you hurt my girlfriend type scenario.

The film picks up, though, once it gets to the actual adaptation of The Killing Joke. Much like the source material, it moves along at a brisk pace and doesnt shy away from the books dark imagery. A couple added scenes build up Jokers frightening reputation among the denizens of Gotham and further his attempt to drive Gordon insane, though there is one added scene between Batman and some prostitutes that gave me pause about Jokers characterization, again making a bizarre choice stand out.

Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy elevate the content they're given and are the standouts of the film. Longtime fans of Mark Hamills The Joker will be very pleased hearing him recite the famous passages of The Killing Joke. Bruce Timm and director Sam Liu even managed to bring to life the books musical number in a creepy manner, making it one of the films highlights and Mark Hamill sells the scene very well and also gives a very distinctive performance as The Joker in the flashbacks, painting the villain in a very sympathetic and tragic light.

Kevin Conroy similarly delivers a great performance as Batman, even in the first half of the film. Along with being his usual badass self, Conroy also gives a nuanced and emotional performance throughout the film, particularly in his interactions with The Joker. All his rage, despair and sympathy shine through and the final moment is something many fans of this genre will surely love.

Fundamentally this entire story revolves around the core conflict within The Joker and Batmans relationship in which they want to understand each other. Batman in this narrative is desperate to try and sort things out before its too late, knowing full well that their battle will only end with one of them killing the other. You can see that all he wants to do is help Joker, finally admitting that he himself suffered a bad day the same as The Joker and that he can help him recover from his demons. The Joker truly wants Batman to admit that he is as crazy as him and even suspects that Batman suffers from a similar past as him, but Batman teases him with the knowledge that only he could go mad and nobody else.

BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE is very much a dark, gritty journey into the mind-set of the Joker as he pushes the boundaries of proving a point through sick, twisted mind games which will leave you disturbed. Its certainly not for the faint-hearted. As stated above, this is very much a character piece exploring the Clown Prince of Crime and his complex nature, as well as his unique bond with Batman. Also one cannot forget about the brilliant little number in the middle where Joker has a song and dance, whilst Gordon is driven to the point of madness as he stares at multiple pictures of his daughter naked and bleeding. Mark Hamill as The Joker certainly got to shine in his moment of glory as he sends off his beloved incarnation with a bang, and it was bittersweet to see this occasion joined by Kevin Conroy as Batman as the two of them sparred off each other in the ultimate finale conclusion, one that will leave you both surprised and totally satisfied.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video and DC Comics Blu-ray release is presented in in its original 1.78:1 aspect ratio, and the 1080p encoded image transfer looks extremely good. The stylised ambience of colours holds up very nicely and really pops out of the screen; and additionally, image detail is really crisp and black levels are fairly consistent, to give a very solid animation. The reds of Barbaras hair, or her shirt, or the pasty white of The Jokers face shows up with impressive clarity. The animated film is as always for a Batman animated film, and is bathed in darkness and black levels are very important. Overall, this a very nice looking transfer for all fans of the DC Comic animated line-up. So a good job well done.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Warner Home Video and DC Comics presents us with a very robust 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track. It also contains a good balance of action mixed in with the drama, and also gets regular use of the surround channels, as well as the directional effects that is used to good use. Gunfire and fistfights have plenty of punch, music cues sound full and rich, and the dialogue is uniformly crisp and easy to understand. But what we experience with the sounds certainly does the job really well and Batman fans should appreciate the effort all round, and especially listening to the raindrops falling when Batman pulls Commissioner Gordon out of cage. I honestly thought it was raining outside as the drops sound ridiculously accurate sound mix. The weight and power behind the bat mobile explosion rocks the listener in their seats, and the fisticuffs carry a surprising amount of power to them. So a very good and excellent effort all round.

Finally, this DC Comic animated film is well worth checking out, especially if you are a massive fan of the DC Comic publications, especially with the over the top characters from the original graphic novels. I think this is a very solid animated film, and I do not think it is a disadvantage to have not read any of the DC Comic publications, however I would say this should not stop any Batman fans from watching this animated film, despite the massive negative comments about this particular animated film. BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE is a tale of essentially of the macabre, darkly comic thriller which flaunts the macabre potential of the Batman universe proudly. It is a story which acts as a kind of philosophical on two bizarre but brilliant main characters and thats probably why the opening story stands out so much. More than anything, BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE feels like a final stamp of approval on Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroys incredible pairing, giving the two performers a great story and some of the best Batman/The Joker dialogue available to prove why they're still as potent a pairing more than twenty years since they started. Mark Hamill in particular provides his most layered rendition of the Clown Prince of Crime to-date, seizing the opportunities in Alan Moores story to flesh out The Jokers chaos with a little tragedy, back-story, and the calmer tones of a pre-acid supervillain. In the end, BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE is an enjoyably twisted animated Batman film with a good pace of action paced drama and a very gripping story, and ultimately watchable for its very iconic tongue in cheek dialogue and superb performances all round. Highly Recommended!

All I heard about before this was released was how great the story is, and how it's the best Batman story ever.  Even a casual fan knows the gist of this story, how Batgirl became wheelchair bound, and would eventually become Oracle.  But oh my god was this tedious to watch.

7464673,4,B0169PXGUA,Watch it!,1484784000,,9,4.0
7464684,1,B0169PXGUA,"I have heard many critics on Youtube have lists of the worst movies of 2016 and this one has often been mentioned.  Often in passing they will say how awful this was but not go into too much detail in general.  Some people I have heard having this on a list of the worst not having Gods of Egypt being far behind.

To sort this out for myself I watched this movie a couple of nights ago and while as I mentioned I don't know anything about why the critics didn't like it, I will go into this movie's few strengths and many weaknesses.

For starters, the animation takes everything that was great about the animation from the 90's cartoon show plus some cool computer animation to go with that.  The storyline for the Joker proves somewhat compelling also.  I'll go into that in a bit without giving away much.

Unfortunately though this movie also has some time-filling sub-plot that doesn't amount to all that much involving a charming and sharply dressed yet lethal gangster who calls himself Paris Franz.

All that I will say about Paris is he is very slick and sly when it comes to making his getaways and he has a huge crush on Batgirl as she can't help but feel it as well even as she knows that they are enemies and that's that.  Without giving away too much after following Paris and his men a few times, against Batman's wishes Batgirl not only catches up with Paris but she goes overtly Medieval on Paris.  After that on the news Paris's crush on Batgirl doesn't diminish at all.

After that unnecessary sub-plot when then move onto the Joker.  Once the Joker escapes from prison the real storyline begins.

Unfortunately Harley Quinn isn't in this.  The Joker is once again voiced by Mark Hamill(Star Wars episodes 4-7).  Also Batman/Bruce Wayne is still voiced by Kevin Conroy.  The voices both sound lousy lacking in the charisma and gusto from before.  The Joker sounds like he's got bad indigestion and Batman sounds like he has strep throat.

The Joker's brief back story is done mostly different from how it was done in the 1989 Tim Burton movie.  This time he's portrayed as a lowly comedian with a pregnant wife who is struggling financially instead of having him be a criminal from the start.

When the Joker shoots Barbara Gordon aka Batgirl so close to a private area that proves too disturbing.  The fight at the end between Batman and the Joker wasn't very exciting either.

The only thing that that proved entertaining about this trainwreck was the Joker ""Go Looney"" song and dance number.  That was the only time that he felt like the same ol' Joker.

The sexy fling between Batman and Batgirl was there for no reason at all given that Batman continued to act like a crabby drill sergeant towards her afterwards plus it's just never given any closure.

While the animation is good the way Batman is drawn is lousy as he looks much shorter, his shoulders look triangular, and his chin looks like a big potato.

While the intermittent cursing and grown up words don't bother me as an adult, it definitely makes this something that is not for little children.

As great such other Batman cartoons such as the animated series, Batman; Mask of the Phantasm, Son of Batman, The Dark Night Returns part's 1&2, and The Mystery of the Batwoman all proved to be,  it's just shocking hoe badly they loused this one up.",1484784000,,3333,4.575042158516021

7464709,2,B0169PXGUA,"This is the first DC Animated I ever bought and was super excited for it. The past few DC Animated movies haven't been that great (in my opinion there haven't been many good ones since Flashpoint) but I had high hopes for this. I mean, The Killing Joke is considered one of the greatest graphic novels of all time, how could you mess it up?

Well, they did.

Spoilers ahead:

They put Batgirl and Batman together. Fine. It disturbs me because Batgirl belongs with Nightwing, but if that is the way they are going, then fine. But they didn't even put them together in a good way. Batgirl is supposed to be a strong character, but all she did in this movie was dream about Batman. She was pretty much only Batgirl because she was in love with Batman. Was that part of the story really necessary?

The backstory they gave her before the graphic novel content began did no favors to her. Everyone knows she is going to get shot and paralyzed, and everyone knows it will be emotional, so why not make it even more painful to watch? Make the backstory about how great Batgirl was and how much she loved doing what she did. Then rip it all away from her. Make the audience cry and feel pain for her. Instead, they made it as though her paralysis didn't even matter because in the movie she quit being Batgirl before she was shot. So, it was sad, but not as sad.

A good story would have shown how much she loved helping people at the beginning, have the graphic novel content, and then show how she adjusted afterwards and her road to becoming Oracle. That would have been perfect.

Instead the creators felt as though they had to include romance. Then had some random, filler characters that were no more than stereotypes.

I give it 2 stars because of the animation. But the story killed the graphic novel. I wish I didn't buy it :(",1482883200,11,1827,4.387573964497041
7464710,1,B0169PXGUA,"It's been awhile since I read the graphic novel but when I found out they were making an animated movie based on the book, I was excited, I couldn't wait to see it then when I found out it was being shown on HBO & not The Cartoon Network like I expected it was going to be, I was even more excited. I thought it was going to be (For some stupid reason) exactly like the graphic novel. I guess it's true, the book is always better than the movie. Watching Batman: The Killing Joke was like watching an episode/movie of Batman: The Animated Series but with sex & extreme violence. This movie was not for the kids. Since it was more like watching Batman: The Animated Series, the sex & extreme violence felt unnecessary. It didn't add anything to the movie at all. If this movie was supposed to be based on the graphic novel then they should've stuck to the story. At times I also found the movie to be boring.

7464731,2,B0169PXGUA,"How do you screw up a movie based on one of the great Batman stories of all-time? No, I'm not asking that question in relation to Zack Snyder's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, which was based in part on The Dark Knight Returns. I'm talking about Warner Bros. Animation's Batman: The Killing Joke, based on the classic Alan Moore story that attempts to explore the devastating forces that allowed for the Joker to exist.

And yet the film version, lauded for its R-rated grit, fails to tell us much of anything about the Joker, instead focusing its energies on a poorly-conceived love affair between Batman (voiced by the great Kevin Conroy) and Barbara Gordon aka Batgirl (Tara Strong), with much of the story centered on her. That's right, arguably the definitive Joker story ever is now a movie about Batgirl, which would be one thing if it told us anything about her, but instead it reduces her in ways many will find offensive, and for good reason.

The poorly constructed story begins with an overlong prologue in which Batgirl becomes infatuated with a handsome-yet-psychotic criminal named Paris Franz. He becomes obsessed with her, even killing to impress her, which she finds ""flattering"" (Say what!?). Batman tries to warn her off but she won't listen, and it ends up nearly getting her killed. Has she become addicted to the thrill? The danger? Turns out her reasons for such risk-taking are because she has the hots for Batman, leading to sexual fling that is...awkward, to say the least. Want to know how Batman reacts after a one-night-stand? Let's just say it's probably a good idea not to wait by the phone for his call.

This ridiculous setup ends with a thud, and the transition over to Joker's story isn't smooth. Here, we learn about Joker (with Mark Hamill doing great voicework once again) and his sad-sack origin as a loser wannabe comedian who can't support his pregnant wife. He falls in with a bad crowd, then literally falls into a vat of acid thanks to Batman, turning crazy in the process. But none of that really goes anywhere in explaining why he's of such a demented mind that he shoots, paralyzes, and sexually abuses Barbara, before kidnapping and torturing her father, Commissioner Jim Gordon (Ray Wise).  The assault she suffers has no weight, it has no meaning other than that she banged Batman once, which is about as lowly a way to portray such a great superheroine as I can think of.

The second half of the movie post-prologue is pretty faithful to the comic, but portrayed in a choppy, episodic manner that dulls its impact. Batman and Joker are two sides of a coin, and with Bats fearing their bloody rivalry will end in one of their deaths, he sets out to try and rehabilitate his mortal enemy. At least on screen this makes no sense, not in light of the actions Joker has committed. Moore and artist Brian Bolland were wise enough to leave a dark ambiguity to their conclusion, but the film, directed by Sam Liu, is strangely comical at the worst possible time. There's no edge to be found here and certainly no insight into a handful of DC's greatest comic book characters. While there is plenty of brutal violence and sex to go around, along with the typically solid animation, that isn't enough to make Batman: The Killing Joke anything other than a disappointment unworthy of its source material.",1480723200,,3349,4.737564322469983

7464750,2,B0169PXGUA,"Just  finished watching ""Batman - The Killing Joke"" released by Warner Brothers.
I remember that actress Yvonne Craig, who played Bat Girl in the original live action television show during the 1960s was quoted as being extremely unhappy with Barbara Gordon's/Bat Girl's fate when ""The Killing Joke"" was first released in paperback format.  [Why yes, Zack Newsome, I do still have the original graphic novel somewhere on the shelves.]  I equally suspect that Yvonne Craig would not have liked the animated movie of this still controversial graphic novel.  I do remember that you did have to be over 18 years old in order to buy it in North Carolina and you were carded.
""The Killing Joke"" is essentially a two part movie - the first part being filler material for the darker second act.  SPOILER ALERT - the first part of this movie is basically about a sexually frustrated and spoiled Barbara Gordon who wants to take her relationship with Batman to the next level - only it doesn't go the way she plans because a psychotic wannabe gangster has become obsessed with her and wants to make her his ultimate sexual conquest.  Batman warns her off the case, but she persists and in the end, gives up being Bat Girl because she almost slide into the deep abyss that Batman had warned her about.  Oh, yes, let's not forget that Bat Girl and Batman do have sex on a rooftop.
Enter heart of ""The Killing Joke"" graphic novel.  While  this second act of the animated movie does remain true to the heart and soul[less] of the original graphic novel, it also reveals why the Joker's origins are cloaked in mystery - he has a multi-choice past.
Oh yes, the Joker does have a musical number while he's tormenting Commissioner Gordon.
Recommended only if you're a die hard Batman fan.  ""Batman - The Killing Joke"" would have been a far better movie if it had just stuck with the original story of the graphic novel instead of adding an unnecessary and unrealistic Bat Girl back story.  [Sorry Zack Newsome, Katie Wy wouldn't like it if I let you borrow this DVD.]

After the first 30 minutes it is a straight adaptation of the Killing Joke comic, but there are some problems here as well.  The backgrounds are lacking detail and people that were in the comic and could have really added to the atmosphere of certain scenes.  The voice acting was the strongest point of this film.  Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill are still my favorite voice actors or versions of Batman and Mark Hamill respectfully.

I have read the GN and most of the well-known Batman GNs, as well as having seen most of the animated DCU movies, and this one is the worst WB has produced. It seems rushed to me. There's a lot of pointless back-and-forth banter, a lot of dreadfully dull monolog, and painfully drawn-out scenes (especially with Commissioner Gordon at the amusement park). Even a Batman or DC uber-fan with OCD can skip this without feeling any loss in one's movie library. I did not quite finish it the first time--started skipping thru the pointless scenes, and even the ending was deflated and anti-climatic. If I owned this bluray, I would never watch it again.

7464928,4,B0169PXGUA,"I debated whether this should get 3 Stars (""It's okay"") or 4 Stars (""I Liked It"").  Either one is fitting in that it's not as good as I hoped, but it isn't bad either--or in other words, I liked it well enough to say, ""yeah, I'm glad I watched it and have it in my collection.""  I finally went with four stars just because I do think its getting somewhat of a bad wrap for the wrong reasons.  Chiefly, people seem to be crapping all over it because of the Batgirl storyline - and seem incensed that Batgirl (rather than Batman) is the clear protagonist - which she absolutely is.  It's true that ""The Killing Joke"" film is told through the point of view of Barbara Gordan/Batgirl.  The story is largely about her; she even narrates it.  This seems to be an issue with some folks in and of itself, to which I say, ""Wow, no love for Batgirl?""  Well, considering Batgirl has always been a favorite of mine (I had the biggest crush on Yvonne Craig in the 1960's ""Batman"" TV series when I was a child) and continued loving the character throughout the iconic ""The Animated Series"" which launched the DCAU (aka ""Timmverse""), I can't really complain about that.  I actually liked her storyline in this movie.  It's been pointed out all over the Internet that the whole first half the film focuses on a brand new storyline revolving around Barbara/Batgirl before ever beginning the actual retelling the of ""The Killing Joke"" comic book--and basically the consensus is that the movie is uninteresting until we get to the TKJ portion of the film.  I have to say, for me, it was the exact opposite.  I found the first half of the film much more interesting (and coherent) than the second half.  In fact, for me, it was the second half, ""The Killing Joke"" portion of the film, which began to go off the rails and end with a strangely tame ending, given the otherwise dark subject matter.  It was like a dark, R-rated film with a weird Hanna-Barbera, kid friendly ending, where everyone has a laugh a la ""Super Friends.""  Wait, what?  I'm not saying it shouldn't have a positive ending, but it's just...weird...the way it happens.  Regardless, I have no problem with the way Barbara Gordan features in the film.

I've never read ""The Killing Joke"" comic, so I can't speak to how closely it follows the comic.  I just know that TKJ portion of the film (which turns it attention from Batgirl to the Joker) is interesting (and brilliantly performed, once again, by Mark Hammill), but is no *more* interesting than the quasi-origin story we also get for Batgirl (and by extension, Oracle).  And the fact that (trying to not spoil it...) they build her character up and get us to care about her prior to what would otherwise come off as a completely random act by the Joker--should not be a point of criticism.  I think the movie handles it well.

Another point of contention people have (at this point, I don't think it's much of a spoiler) is that Batman and Batgirl...shall I say...become closer than many people are comfortable with.  Well, this should NOT be a surprise to anyone who is familiar with Timmverse.  The later TAS episodes hinted at it and the TAS movies and ""Batman Beyond"" confirmed it, unequivocally.  Bruce Wayne and Barbara Gordan became a thing.  They did it.  Long before this move came out.  Yes, she was dating Dick, but she always pined for Bruce and finally he gave in.  Anyone who knows Timmverse knows this to be true, at least in that universe.  (Which, by the way, it's not like she's a teenager.  She's a grown woman in her twenties.)  Well, guess who wrote and directed this movie--Bruce Timm--co-creator of the DCAU or ""Timmverse.""  Thus, it should not be all that shocking that a movie starring all of the voices of TAS and making multiple references to that series should also reference and reaffirm that particular storyline.

Although, I have not seen any official declaration that this film takes place within Timmverse, it seems that it should and perhaps, in the mind of Bruce Timm, it does.  There's little if anything in The Killing Joke movie that should preclude it from existing in that continuity.  (Even Barbara Gordan being able to walk in ""Batman Beyond"" could be easily explained with the kind of future technologies we see in that series.)  To me, this movie is a new and long awaited continuation of the DCAU/Timmverse continuity--and until something else comes along to contradict that, I don't see why it can't be.  That in itself makes it worth having.",1474329600,,4492,4.64765525982256

Ok for those who don't know about the killing joke this animated movie is about one of Jokers origin stories that came from an 80's comic which was phenomenal. This movie added a short movie right before the joker's story. The short movie was about batgirl dealing with a thug that was obsessed with her and it was great........EXCEPT FOR BATGIRL AND BATMAN SEX! Ok what bothered me the most wasn't the sex itself it was those two sleeping with each other for no reason! NO ACTUAL REASON! Batgirl is on top of batman after a fight then she kisses him and they do it. Like those stupid pointless cliches they put in tv shows. STUPID POINTLESS CLICHE THAT WAS OUT OF CHARACTER FOR BATMAN! Listen everything about the movie was great (except that stupid pointless cliche sex which is why it doesn't get 5 stars) so great that I give this 4 stars. It's worth the money.

7464942,4,B0169PXGUA,"A good adaptation of an iconic tome in the Batman universe.  I don't know that it truly earned its R-rating, but it was definitely the sadistic romp I remember from reading the book.  Like the book it examines the true depths of the depravity of the Joker, while examining for the first time some of his origin, though in great comic fashion we are left with maybe more questions than answers on that front.  This is how I remember Batman though, and what I think he really should be.  Its not bright and shiny, its dark and grimy.  The Killing Joke is really an examination of the long term effects of extreme emotional trauma.  Bruce Wayne reacted to his parents' deaths by becoming Batman, a solitary superhero who's pushed himself in every way to be unstoppable; the best at every aspect of the game.  Underneath that though Bruce is living with post traumatic stress that's so deep its become a part of his personality, arguably what makes him so good as Batman, yet leaves him with no real life other than his crusade.  The man who would become the Joker by contrast undergoes a physical transformation in the wake of his own emotional trauma, and goes down a path of what most would view as insanity, but is really a lot more frightening.  We see glimpses of the man he used to be, but its clear that man is almost completely gone; swallowed by the persona of the Joker.  The viewer is left to wonder, how would we react?  What happens to someone pushed past the breaking point?",1473724800,,1485,4.503731343283582

The first 40 minutes are a waste.  All they really accomplish is showing Barbra Gordon as a weak, unthinking woman who sleeps with her boss then quits her job.  So I guess she wasn't that driven after all.  Also there is nothing in the first 40 minutes that ties at all into the main story (or the book story if you prefer).

The animation is ok.  There is some that is downright awful.  That happens when they are trying to capture the look of the original book.  Those attempts fail so badly they are what I remember most.

The voice acting is fine, Hamill and Conroy are always great at these roles.

Also, I didn't mind the misogyny from the prologue's villain, after all, the word says it, he's a villain, so we have to expect the worst from the human characteristic, beliefs, and ideas ingrained in him, but the problem is that he is so bland, and boring, unlike most of Batman's rogues gallery.

She sleeps with her father figure and mentor.  We don't see it happening of course.  Not even a kiss.  Kinda reminds me of the ""romance"" option in Fallout 4

This is the origin story of The Joker and how he wants to drive Commissioner Gordon insane by merely paralyzing his daughter and not flat-out kill her which should drive him even more insane I would think.  And why didn't that gut shot kill her?  I find it hard to believe that shot wouldn't have killed her but somehow found her spine.....but then I'm not a comic book writer or a doctor so what do I know?

The movie is Rated R but it's not that bloody or graphic.

THE KILLING JOKE

As a huge fan of the original comic by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland I was super excited by the idea of this film being made. I was even more excited when I learned it would be DCs first rated R animated movie. Then I could only be more excited with the news that Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy were returning to voice The Joker and Batman respectively. I had to miss the theatrical release of the flick although it was showing here but my wife picked up the combo pack that came with the Joker figurine for me. So later on we sat down to enjoy it along side my brother.

Batgirl is a college student by day as Barbra Gordon and fighting crime at night with Batman. One night she comes across a robbery and while most get away she and Batman do capture one. At the same time the leader of the gang Franz it turns out has had his heart captured by Batgirl as he becomes obsessed with her. He lures her into a fight in which he gets the upper hand, leaving Batman questioning if she is getting to emotionally involved in this case. This leads to problems they may never have thought they would run into. Not only is Franz still out there but an old enemy known as The Joker is back and he is on his way to cause one of the biggest events in DC history.

Now if you don't know the first thirty minutes or so of this film is completely new to The Killing Joke story. All of the Batgirl stuff at the begging was added to fill out the run time and show us the relationship between Barbra and Bruce in this universe. Also I didn't mind the part involving them two that had everyone else up in arms, this is clearly a different universe than the normal one. Still that does not make the film a perfect one because it is not. The first half of the film is clearly not as strong as the last that was the actual story form the book. Of course I do love that last half and the fact that they kept the ending intact, love the way they did that.

Of course the voice acting here is excellent; Hamill and Conroy of course are a wonderful addition to any film. They return here as The Joker and Batman and of course they kill it, see what I did there. The rest of the cast is great as well as there is not one person miscast here. Also I was kinda put off by the animation when I saw the trailer but here in the film I think it was perfect. In fact I love the shots that they got right from the panels of the comic. So over all I think that this is a good movie, not the classic that it could have been. The Blu-Ray comes with two great Joker episodes from two different animated series and a look at the next movie from them. Also we get a great look at The Killing Joke and the music behind the film.",1473206400,,2708,4.037243947858473
7465004,4,B0169PXGUA,"I really like this movie, especially since they got Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill to voice Batman and the Joker. The part of the movie that followed the storyline of the Killing Joke stayed really close to to the comic. The story about Batgirl at the beginning was pretty good as well. My only complaint was that I felt like the two storylines didn't really go together all that well.

7465009,3,B0169PXGUA,"Apparently the comic/graphic novel itself wasn't long enough to justify a full DVD.  So the first half is a Batman/Batgirl story that's completely unrelated to ""The Killing Joke"".  In it, Barbara behaves petulantly when Batman tells her pursuing the key bad guy is too dangerous.  Sort of like the way various Robins over the years whined to ride along in the Batmobile.  Except Barbara doesn't listen and almost dies a few times.  The conflict between girl and Man climaxes in a way most inappropriate for their history.  I was really disappointed.

Then we get a frame-for-panel recreation of the original book which is fine...no surprises, no disappointments.

Okay, spazzing over.  Mostly,  Now... Like everyone else says, once you get past the first 28 minutes, the actual adaptation of Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's graphic novelette is very close to the original.  For those of you who think they ""changed the ending,"" take into account that Batman keeps laughing after the Joker stops. 5 stars for how closely they stick to the original story (once they get there), minus a star because I haven't made up my mind how much I like the original story, even though it's by Moore, one of my top three favorite comic writers.

7465054,3,B0169PXGUA,"I have three points on this movie (the third one contains spoilers):

1. The second half of this movie follows the graphic novel exactly, and it is wonderfully disturbing. Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy make the film just that much better.

2. I did not like the voice actor they got for Commissioner Jim Gordon, his voice is a bit high and breathy and doesn't seem to fit the character.

3. !!PLOT SPOILERS!!
The first 30 minutes of this movie are basically a TV episode about Barbara Gordon/Batgirl and Batman that connects in no way to the rest of the movie. In theory it seems like a good idea because it gives the audience a chance to get to know Barbara so they care when she is attacked by the Joker.  Here's the problem: they decide to romantically pair up Barbara and Batman.  This is an R-rated movie, so they had them go all the way.  This is wrong for so many reasons: A)Batman is about the same age as Barbara's dad, that's a pretty big age difference  B)Chronologically Barbara was dating Dick Grayson at this time, so basically Batman had sex with his sons girlfriend. C) This makes Batman look like the biggest uncaring jerk later in the movie when Barbara is hurt. D) Barbara comes off as needy and insecure, like she's just Batgirl so she can be with Batman.

So, rant over, there is more good then bad in this movie and it will give those of us who like to make amv's more clips of Batgirl to work with, all in all I think this movies a win (especially if you just start watching at the 30min mark)",1472515200,2,1515,4.347517730496454
7465055,2,B0169PXGUA,I think I am done with DC animation films.  This movie has so much hype but ultimately disappoints.  The story plot was basic and the dialogue was not interesting at all.  The ending is the most unsatisfying of it all.  The recent DC animation films were also bad: JCL vs Teen Titans.  I think I'll just skip future releases from now on.

It's always great to hear Hamil and Conroy together, which is definitely the best aspect of the whole experience. This is one of the very few DC animated pieces I wasn't completely excited about, but again I think that is strongly linked to the unnecessary Batgirl additions.

7465105,3,B0169PXGUA,"The only downside to this movie is the Batgirl prologue. As a huge fan of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl as a character, the prologue butchers her EXTREMELY. She acts nothing like herself, and (mild spoilers) has sex with Batman for practically no reason (After they had an intense argument). It depicts her as a hotheaded idiot with a ""daddy"" fetish.
It also undermines her motivation to fight crime, which, in this version, could potentially just be wanting to have sex with Batman, which is not the case at all. She started fighting crime because she wanted to. She fought crime because she wanted to help people.
The rest of the movie is fantastic and a great adaptation of the graphic novel, and nothing more needs to be said. If the Batgirl prologue were missing (Or was simply true to the characters) my review would be a solid 4.5/5, with .5 away from a 5/5 due to occasional lazy animation.

The prologue has it's moments, and it's a fun bit of animation if you're a fan of the original animated series.  Several moments in it seem kind of awkward, though, so be ready for that.  The prologue ends on a note that connects somewhat well to the Killing Joke, but the transition from the prologue's story to the Killing Joke still feels jarring, and it seems something's just not quite right.

Once the prologue ends and the Killing Joke begins, though, the adaptation is excellent.  Most lines are read verbatim from the comic book.  The animation is done differently, but scenes match their respective comic book panels very well.  Mark Hamill's performance as the Joker alone is a good reason to watch this film, as he plays his role excellently.

Pros-
Mark Hamill is, as always, FANTASTIC as Joker.  Seriously, he's great.
Solid animation that is faithful to the graphic novel.
Really captures many of the panels of the graphic novel.

Cons-
The entire first 20 or 30 minutes was just unnecessary and incongruous with the graphic novel.
The carnival scene lost some impact due to the pictures being spread out and the song.

Yeah, that's it in a nutshell.  If you don't mind liberties being taken with the original source material, it's a solid adaptation.  Moore purists will hate it.  Everyone else should enjoy it.",1471651200,,749,4.7890625

7465169,3,B0169PXGUA,"THE FILM: I'll be up-front about one thing: I don't read comics, instead enjoying these characters through movies and TV. So, I haven't read the Alan Moore graphic novel upon which this is based. However, I do know that this adaptation added a half-hour prologue centered on Barbara Gordon/Batgirl. I didn't really have a problem with this addition, per se, but I feel like her portrayal was occasionally sexist and certainly clichd. Ultimately, I feel like the film would have been fine without this prologue because Barbara Gordon wasn't the point of the story anyway, merely being the precipitant for the main plot of Batman's conflict with the Joker. As for that portion, I thought that it was among the darkest and best work that DC has done with their characters (thematically, at least). I still think that BATMAN: THE ANIMATED SERIES is the high watermark for DC Animation, but the way THE KILLING JOKE explores Batman and Joker's complex relationship made for a thrilling, occasionally frightening, story. The gist of Joker's argument is that all it takes is ""one bad day"" for someone to be driven to madness as he was. Peppered through the second half are flashbacks to his life before becoming the Joker which did a lot to humanize him. Quality-wise, the animation was OK. Dialogue scenes were fluid enough, but the action scenes had some really obvious computer augmentation. As for voice-over work, Mark Hamill was the best he's ever been, while, unfortunately, Kevin Conroy was kind of spotty. As for the rating, aside from some bloody headshots, I don't know why they went for an R. Yes, it was disturbing in parts, but I feel like the rating was sensationalism for its own sake. THE KILLING JOKE is one of DC's most famous stories, and it receives a mostly proper adaptation here. However, a misguided prologue keeps it from being as good as it could have been.

THE EXTRAS: There are actually quite a few extra features on the Blu-ray, but only a couple of them directly relate to THE KILLING JOKE. They are a 12-minute featurette on the score, and an 18-minute featurette on the Joker in particular, and the psychological realism in comics initiated by Alan Moore in general. Neither one of them went into great detail, at least of the kind I've been accustomed to, but at least they weren't boring. The longer featurette on Joker was the better of the two, mostly for behind-the-scenes footage of Mark Hamill in the recording studio. The other special features were mostly trailers for other DC Animation films, e.g., BATMAN: BAD BLOOD. There was also a sneak-peek at the next DCAU feature, JUSTICE LEAGUE: DARK (which I'd already seen online). As is customary for these animated movies, they also had a couple episodes from the 90's Batman animated series (in this instance, both Joker-centric). By far the coolest extra wasn't on the disc: it was the Joker figurine that came with this ""Deluxe"" edition. There was also a DVD and Ultraviolet copy of the title feature.

OVERALL: To reiterate, I haven't read the graphic novel, but I am inclined to after seeing this flawed adaptation (and partly on the strength of Alan Moore's other work). The special features were welcome, but strain the meaning of the word ""special,"" being mostly typical talking-head interviews and behind-the-scenes footage (and promotions for other DCAU titles). Ultimately, while I did like the film, I'm not overwhelming in my endorsement. Fans of the graphic novel will probably want to watch the film to see if they feel like it was done justice. Others, maybe so, if you like these types of films in the first place.",1471564800,2,3615,4.866883116883117
7465170,4,B0169PXGUA,"The Killing Joke is one of the Holy Grails of Batman graphic novels. This new movie adapts the book very well.

7465173,5,B0169PXGUA,"Let's begin by saying that adapting a 48 page comic to a 77 minute movie is a BIG task....
So if you expect to see exactly what is in the comic, no more, no less, then move along an keep going to another place.
This movie takes almost half of its lenght to show you a little background story about Batgirl/Barbara Gordon and her relation with Batman.
After that we go into the story of the comic. Sincerely its a nice adaptation, almost exactly as the comic, but with a few extra scenes that almost didn't work for me.
Joker singing in a scene where he displays images to Commissioner Gordon (we'll not enter into details of what the photos include or why he shows them to Gordon so we don't spoil the plot) was a great p scene for Mark Hammil to show his humor in character, but in the context of the history i found it a bit out of place.
Also there is a kinda of in the middle of credits scene that also was a bit out of context for the story.
The ending of the comic for those who had read it, it's transfered into the movie ALMOST perfectly..... ALMOST because you don't get the same kind of mystery about that great ending in the comics, but... i guess it is due to the comic having frames, missing ""scenes"" that here are all in one shot.....
About the audio great DTS track and pleasure to hear Kevin ""batman"" Conroy, Mark ""Joker"" Hammil and Tara ""Batgirl"" Strong.
The video as a direct to video animation looks great on BLURAY
Also worthy of mentioning is the preview for the next DC Animated Movie Justice League Dark with Constantine, Zatanna, Swamp Thing, Deadman, etc.
This movie is definitely not for kids, so if you are planning to buy it for your kids, forget it.....
About the figure, the packaging was a bit difficult to release the figure from the holder, but it you take the figure by the lower part of the Joker Body, it is easier and you won't risk breaking the head or the figure.
The box itself is not too big, almost as big as 3 or 4 normal blurays by the side.",1471564800,11,1985,4.253968253968254
7465174,2,B0169PXGUA,"I wanted to really like it... the classic voice cast was there, a great story to work with... But the first half with Batgirl just killed it for me. It's the same gimmicky, for the sake of shock value, trying to be cool, nonsense DC has been doing since New 52. Bruce should be more like a father figure, but this made their relationship awkward and creepy to me. Instead of building me up to feel sorry for Batgirl, it made me dislike the character and cheer on Joker when he finally got to shoot her.
The real Killing Joke part was ok. It seemed a bit rushed though it was almost exactly like the comic. I would have liked this a lot more without the Batgirl nonsense, stick to just the Killing Joke but pace the story out better, and add a few original things to the story.

In short- rent it, borrow it, judge it for yourself. I don't think it's was worth buying as I'll never watch it again. If you like New 52 and that newer kind of stuff you'll probably like it. It's like those comics mixed with the old stuff.",1471478400,2,1018,4.1938775510204085

7465176,3,B0169PXGUA,"I really wanted to like this, but like other recent DC animated offerings I was left sadly disappointed. I feel DC pushed the ""this is RATED R!"" line a little too much in the promo for this. If you're going to go R then pull punches and end up with a very PG-13 movie, you will leave audiences feeling misled. I feel the only reason this is R is because it is animated. Nothing in here feels R (sure there's blood and sex, but it's pulled away from) and instead feels more like a TV-14 or PG-13 live-action one-shot. I'm not asking for pointless nudity or cursing, but this still feels like it's being played safe.

Fans of The Killing Joke graphic novel will be left with an empty feeling not nearly as unsettling as the novel left them originally. Fans of Mark Hamill's Joker and Conroy's Batman will be left feeling a little dirty. The voice are straight B:TAS, but these characterizations of the characters are not. It's hard to detach the voices with the characters on the screen, and this made the film less impactful than it should have been. While I love Conroy's Batman and Hamill's Joker is perfection, I wish other voices would have been chosen for this particular story. Jared Leto might actually have done this Joker characterization well (kidding... sort of).

One thing that did not bother me as much as everyone else who forgot about the B:TAS/Beyond/Justice League continuity is the relationship between Batman and Batgirl. This is a storyline from the Batman: animated series (and from what I hear, recent comics) that was integrated here. This relationship is heavily referenced in Batman Beyond by Commissioner Barbara Gordon. However, since this is NOT a part of the B:TAS continuity, it feels forced. I almost wish this would have been approached as a spin on the ""Batman: The Killing Joke"" graphic novel story within the B:TAS continuity or an alternate timeline sort of take, rather than a standalone story. As a standalone story, this almost feels too rushed. Yes, the graphic novel content is here and then some, but it still feels shallow and not long enough, and that's with the plot meandering slowly through the story to squeeze out time. Yikes.

Most of the above would have been forgivable and I still would have given a 4-star rating if the animation had impressed me. However, I am disappointed by the animation. When Batman and Batgirl start making out it looks like someone banging two plastic dolls together - which makes the scene more disturbing than it already is, but for the wrong reasons. If The Killing Joke Moore style had been used it would have been okay - albeit it probably WAY to bright on screen. As it is, this animation sits below what was being done on Justice League and Young Justice. There is a lot more attention to animation that could have been done that I feel corners were cut on just to get this movie released in time for Comic Con. I hate giving DC animated movies 3 stars, but I have to 3-star this. Add this to my list of regrets from the DC Animated Movieverse. Can we just have Young Justice back?",1471478400,6,3066,4.632352941176471

7465221,4,B0169PXGUA,"Based on the groundbreaking prestige format one-shot by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland, Warner Bros. decided to take on the task of the most controversial Batman comic by turning it into an animated feature. This was slightly difficult not because of the mature nature, but because the original material would only make for about a 45-minute long feature. So, to pad out the running time to at least over an hour, they decided to put a separate prelude featuring Batgirl, slightly based on the Batgirl Special one-shot that came out less than a year prior to Batman: The Killing Joke. This was met with a lot of backlash from the fan community, partially because it doesn't completely fit in to the main segment, but mostly because it shown to further DC animated projects weird habit of shipping characters who don't have any love interest in each other in the comics, or even meet up that regularly either(i.e.: Green Lantern and Hawkgirl).

 Taking place in its own storyline with no connection to Batman: The Animated Series or any of the other DC projects like the New 52 movies, this story starts out with Batgirl meeting up with Batman chasing an up an coming young mobster, Paris Franz(made up for the movie). Paris takes a shining to Batgirl, while trying to take over his uncle's mob, and nearly succeeds in trapping Batgirl with sleeping gas, so Batman forbids her to go after Paris. Batgirl defiantly fights against Batman, where things heat up and of course leads to them making out on a rooftop. Whether this is Batman projecting Catwoman or some other ex-girlfriend in tight leather onto Batgirl is never really explained, but he then distances himself from her while hunting Paris. However, Paris gets the drop on him by hitting the Batmobile with a rocket launcher, but Batgirl shows up punch the living wazoo out of him, blaming him for the rift now formed between her and Batman. Barbara Gordon then retires from being Batgirl, partially for her feelings for Batman, but also because Paris made the whole hero business too personal for her.

 The next part is a pretty clear adaptation of The Killing Joke itself. although the prelude does succeed in realizing how Batgirls aggression towards Paris mirrors his relationship with the Joker, who has recently escaped Arkham. While Batman beats down thugs trying to find him, Joker invades Commissioner Gordon's apartment, kidnapping him, and shooting Barbara which paralyzes her legs. Joker takes Gordon to an abandoned amusement park he ""bought"", and tortures Gordon with naked pictures of Barbara he took after shooting her. Batman is invited to the Joker's park, and fights off his freak show minions, afterwards he discovers Gordon has still kept his sanity despite the Joker's torture. The Dark Knight chases after the Clown Prince in a near fight to the death, but Batman's spares him in the hope he might someday be able to save Joker from his own madness. This ends in the notoriously ambiguous finale as to whether Batman kills the Joker after telling him a joke that sums up their relationship.

 The backlash given to the movie is given mostly to fans hating the Batman/Batgirl sex scene, which is because the majority of longtime comics fans were stuck on Batgirl and Robin being a couple, plus Batgirl being the daughter of one of Batman's best allies. The original Batgirl Special the prelude was inspired by would have worked within the confines of The Killing Joke movie as a DC Showcase, similar to the Catwoman special was released with Batman: Year One as a follow up to the movie centering on the Catwoman of that movie's universe. It would mean that the The Killing Joke itself would either be even more padded out by about another 10 minutes or so, but it might have simmered some serious heat off of it. It is satisfying to finally see a DC Universe movie where Batgirl has an active role, however the DC animated features ""fetish"" of hooking up unrelated characters doesn't pan out well here, even though its long been established that Batgirl has had a thing for Batman. The actual Killing Joke portion of the movie is exceptionally well done, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill being recast as the eternal rivals. Some have criticized that the animation doesn't fully live up to Brian Bolland's style, but considering how realistic his art style was back in the day, this was no easily obtainable task. However, the design and animation manage to work well for this feature, at least up to the same specs as some of the current DC Universe animated projects. It's worth a look at, mostly because of its historical significance, but also as a inventive take on one of the highest regarded titles in American comics.",1471219200,,4704,4.830024813895782

What I don't remember (and don't think has EVER occurred) is Batgirl riding Batman's #$%$ on a rooftop.  What writing genius thought that was a good idea to add to the storyline?  Every fanboy knows that Batgirl and Robin/Nightwing are the ones with the fling, not Batgirl and Batman.  Overlooking that, the movie was pretty good overall, with some obvious flaws.

The movie is divided into what is basically two movies: (1) Batgirl out fighting crime until she #$#@! Batman and then decides to quit the superhero biz and (2) the Joker's story, which doesn't start until after the first part finishes.  I think it could have been more cohesive storyline...and maybe do something with the characters that didn't involve a rooftop $%@!fest.  Perhaps embellish the existing graphic novel storyline with more character development and shows scenes that happened in between the panels?  Just a thought.  But...what's done is done.

Another point that other reviewers have made is the animation.  It was ok, but not up to par for a theatrical release, even a limited one.  DC should definitely have put a little more into the artwork.

7465226,5,B0169PXGUA,"Don't let the internet trolls steer you wrong. This was a *really* good movie, worthy being added to your collection. The producers were wise to bring back the original cast from Batman: The Animated Series. Though Jason O'Mara has been doing a decent job in the past few movies, Kevin Conroy will always be the quintessential voice of Batman, just the same as Mark Hamill will always be the man who elevated The Joker to one of the best villians ever. They even got Tara Strong back to voice Batgirl, which was a nice touch.

Overall, the movie can be taken in two acts. While the first act is all new material to better establish Batgirl/Barbara Gordon, the second act is a faithful recreation of the original Killing Joke comicbook. Here is where we get to the crux of all the nay sayers'  complaints; they see act one as a cancer that needlessly grew out of the core material. But here's the thing. It was a necessary addition that needed to be included to make this a complete movie, and here's why.

In order to get a feel for the events in act two, the part directly adapted from the comicbook, you need to know who the characters are and what they mean to each other. You'd think that would be obvious, but not necessarily. Frankly, in the comic and act two, Batgirl doesn't even appear in costume nor does she have any real connection to Batman. The inclusion of the first act rectifies that, making her feel like she's more than just someone who happens to be on screen. It brings her to life, and makes the suspence and emotion of the movie that much more palpable. Beyond that, and another very good reason for the inclusion of act one, is the fact that the original Killing Joke comic was just a single 32-page one-shot. While a classic, there isn't a lot of material there to stretch into an 80 minute movie! Some filler or padding was needed, and I think the producers made the right decision choosing the direction they ultimately went.

Also, though I don't know what DC's/WB Animation's future plans are, but this movie sets thing up very well if they want to do a Birds of Prey feature in the not too distant future.",1471219200,,2135,4.480719794344473

7465238,3,B0169PXGUA,"SPOILERY but Necessary because the first 30 minutes is not from the actual comic book, but a shoe-horned in prologue that is completely unnecessary.

Okay I won't spoil any of it BUT just know if you are a fan of the comic book when you start watching the movie you might think, ""Wait, this isn't the KILLING JOKE, what is this? Did they put the wrong movie on the blu-ray or did they put the wrong label on the movie?"" I started watching the Blu-ray and took the disc out put it back in, hit play again and I kept thinking something was seriously wrong. Did they put an old Batman Animated Episode on the disc by mistake, was this an animated Batman movie I hadn't heard about and they put it on the disc by accident? I turned it off, rebooted, did I have the right disc in, the menu says the Killing Joke, what is GOING ON?!? After 30 minutes of frustration I finally hit fast forward on the disc and after about 30 minutes THEN the actual KILLING JOKE kicked in...

So the KILLING JOKE part was great! It was awesome to have the Batman voice from the animated series back and to have Mark Hamill back as The Joker! All of the Killing Joke part was great.

THERE WAS NO REASON WHATSOEVER for Warner Bros to add the 30 minute Prologue. They didn't need to add it just for extending the time. Anyone who was a fan of the comic would enjoy it WITHOUT the Prologue - no matter how short the running time would end up being. .

My biggest gripe: WHY WAS THIS R RATED?!? It makes no sense. Did they actually send it through the Ratings Review or just slap the R rating on there for kicks? It's a legitimate question because this is no more violent than Mask of the Phantasm and that was rated PG.

conclusion:

7465245,3,B0169PXGUA,"A celebrated entry in the Batman library, The Killing Joke is dear to a many a Bat fan's heart. While there's room to ague the comic's rank and merits, there is no denying Alan Moore's The Killing Joke is one of the darkest, most sadistic Joker stories ever put to paper. In this popular comic, the Joker went over the edge even by Joker standards. He no longer behaves like a lunatic buffoon, the man with the laugh is out to prove a point: all is takes is one bad day to reach insanity. The story represents a case in character study, examines morbid aspects of human nature and what drives a sociopath, from a comic book's point of viewessentially its a deliciously macabre Joker backstory.

I love that DC didn't change the main story and formula too much. The Killing Joke is already a memorable chapter for Batman and the Joker, it didn't need to be tinkered with or alternated in any shape or form. The animated film adaption did quite well in regards to staying on par with the comic. The main gripe l have with The Killing Joke is with its first 30 minutes of added material that wasn't in the book. Sure it's related to the story and they did their best to tie it in but the storyline they tried to develop for Barbara Gordon/Batgirl simply didn't work as DC might have anticipated.

Barbara/Batgirl is a pivotal character with a big part in The Killing Joke, therefore it is understandable that DC wanted to give its audience a semblance of insight as to her personality. I'll give the writers credit for trying to add to Batgirl's story, but rather than attain its desired effect it was merely pasted onto the original story to stretch out the film. The further dialogue and backstories really didn't end up adding anything crucial. Although l won't go into details, l found Barbara/Batgirl's relationship with Batman to be of poor taste in the film and very much unlike the character fans have known.

I was happy to see a few of my favourite lines from the comic were left intact as there are many memorable quotes. As a fan, hearing the words l've read many times over being brought to life by Mark Hamill was fantastic. At The Killing Joke's apex, the satisfying confrontation and word exchange between Batman and the Joker kept the same spirit as its source. The dialogue isn't always on point however. One ""joke"" in particular is in bad taste. A criminal receiving a beating courtesy of Batgirl looks at her and says, ""Must be that time of the month"". Cringe-worthy.

Speaking of Mark Hamill, his voice acting is possibly the best aspects of The Killing Joke. Hamill as made left his mark on the comic book genre with his work as the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series and various Batman video games.

The animated film doesn't quite match the intensity or pace of the comic largely due to its first part. They managed to get some of the art direction right yet the tone of the story isn't as dark and perverse, but it tries. The Killing Joke is falls short in its attempts to prolong the story, but it is a very faithful adaptation of its comic counterpart. At an hour and sixteen minutes (including credits) it is by no means a long Batman film, yet it feels longer due to added Batgirl backstory which decidedly does not work in its favour. Do yourself a favour and skip the first half-hour of movie, you won't regret it. 3 stars.",1470960000,2,3353,4.526402640264027
7465246,3,B0169PXGUA,"I never read the original graphic novel, but I thought the movie was pretty good.  I feel that there is one problem I have with the story, and it's the Batgirl story in the first thirty minutes.  It makes the movie a chore to watch, because the tale of Batgirl vs Paris, who we only know for being a crime boss' nephew, doesn't even mesh with the story, and it's purely pointless, unless if you want a hint of Bat Sex with your Batman movie.  Afterwards, it's a pretty good film with a very freaky Joker and an excellent performance from the definitive voice of the Joker, Mark Hamill.  The art style also gives off a bit of creepiness whenever the Joker is on screen, and I like the fact that the movie goes into his past as a failing comedian.  It's just saddens me that we have to sit through thirty minutes that will never be touched upon ever again throughout the movie, and I feel like it was just there to lengthen the story to make the movie.  I think if that was why it was done, they could've done so by going more in-depth into Joker's backstory instead of having another movie in it.  Other than that, it's worth a rent, and I will be checking out the graphic novel.",1470873600,,1178,4.255605381165919
7465257,4,B0169PXGUA,"This isn't as bad as everyone says. I think everyone had extremely high expectations, and rightfully so. The killing joke graphic novel is a classic and amazing graphic novel. Really defines how truly terrifying the joker is.

So on to the elephant in the room, the batgirl story addition. This was added to the movie to make it a little longer and give the audience more attachment to batgirl. I will be the first to say it wasn't very good. Both batman and batgirl seemed to act out of character in kind of sexist ways. But the whole batgirl batman relationship has been touched on before, it isn't like they just made this up. It's mentioned in the batman beyond series where Barbara is the commissioner. She seemed to reflect on it like it was a mistake, and the movie shows it in this light. That being said the additional story is very out of place and going to the actual killing joke part is kind of jarring since they are so different. They're like two different movies. If they had just made the batgirl part a featurette for those who wanted more batgirl could see more, and those that just wanted to see the original killing joke could just watch the regular movie it would have been fine, and people would still feel like they are getting there money's worth since the source material is so short. The addition felt tacked on, and unnecessary.

The killing joke part itself was well done, stuck completely to the source material. I have nothing bad to say about that. Overall this was a good film. For me it's still beat by under the red hood and the mask of phantasm.",1470873600,,1581,4.486111111111111

7465261,2,B0169PXGUA,"The month's only halfway over, and when it comes to movies, one company's in the crosshairs of public worry: DC. Between Suicide Squad and The Killing Joke, they were set to sweep the stage and dominate the summer's endbut unfortunately, neither has quite lived up to expectation. I'll explain my feelings on Suicide Squad at a later date, but today I've a few things to say about The Killing Joke, in all its problematic animated flailing.

For those familiar with the source material (rather than those simply enthused to see Mark Hamill returning as the Joker), this was already set to be a controversial pieceit's certainly one of the Dark Knight's grimmer outings, and it's a train wreck beat down of Batgirl and her father from start to finish. That, at least, holds true. Unfortunately, the film makes it even MORE of a Batgirl beat down, with a first act that is quite simply insulting for anyone in the modern age.

The Killing Joke is a short story by any definitionas such, DC added around 30 minutes worth of material to the story for what they thought of as helping us ""get to know"" Batgirl.

Huzzah! Character development! A character abused as a set piece getting to be human!

Tragically, whoever set that train ride in motion rapidly wheeled it off the tracks.

(SPOILERS FOLLOW)

Yes, Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) is our narrator. She comes across like a whining teen lamenting to a diary about the man she has bizarrely decided to sidekick beside (sorry Robin, you're out of this picture). Rather than adopt the father-child or big brother role for which Batman's most characteristically known with his sidekicks, however, Batman maintains a sort of ice and fire thing with Barbara.

He's purposefully cold-shouldering and aloof, but that only seems to make Barb more attached. She exists for him. She is focused on him. She talks about him in not-so-specific terms to a bff when maintaining her normie job. If this is character development, all I'm seeing is a message that women build their lives around the strong men in them. Gross, DC. Gross.

Cue Paris Franz! Mafia fellow and as obsessed with Barb as Barb is with Batman. Alright, a bit more obsessedhe tries to drug her and stalk her, and genuinely exists so Batman can give Batgirl stern lectures about how crime works and why she, despite having no doubt been at this a while, is not cut out for the life. Leave him to his tortured martyrdomlittle girls trying to play superhero shouldn't be in this part of the playground. She screams, but not in a way that gives her any feelingshe screams like a child denied a cookie, made to look petulant and illogical despite the fact that this is the woman who LATER BECOMES ORACLE AND KNOWS ALL AND SEES ALL.

And after all this yelling, the plot is propelled forward throughsex. Because yelling and shouting and violence is all but foreplay, don't you know? They strip. Camera pans away. Bat nookie is made on a rooftop. Public indecency is apparently not one of the things vigilante-bats police.

Holy crap, I thought at this point, what is going on in this script?

Batman smart. Batgirl dumb. Sex for everybody.

After she causes Batman to get jumped by Franz, and after Barbara overcomes Franz, she comes to the conclusion thatwait for itBatman was right all along. This just isn't the life for her; time to call it quits. Naturally, this comes after showing her wailing on Franz and displaying her full feminine madness, her overly emotional nature, and

Wait, did they just make a Time of the Month joke? Seriously?

Okay. Maybe she SHOULD have killed the gangster.

Please note the ""emotional instability"" also comes to head after Batman doesn't call her back after their less than sexy dance in the moonlight, and there is general whining about said less than sexy times.

Essentially, DC worked very hard to take Batgirl from a victim working to move set pieces between a duel of Batman and Joker and turned her into an emotionally unstable, petulant every-teen trope who dreamed beyond her ken.

And still is a set piece. Because obviously the actual Killing Joke story still has to happen. Which makes the two acts seem more than a bitdisjointed.

Batman, now operating solo, finds evidence of a crime in the city with all the hallmarks of the Jokerwho's supposed to be locked up. When he goes to lecture Joker (he really likes to lecture, it turns out), he goes on for a bit before he discovers an old friend and not the Joker. Cue Joker appearing in Gotham, cackling with mad Mark Hamill glee, shooting Barbara in front of her dad and making off with the addled policeman.

Then come the flashbacks from a flawed narratorthe Joker's not even sure if the origin story he's peddling is true. Don't get me wrong: this whole section is true to comic, almost painfully so. However, what works in one medium doesn't necessarily work in another, and in this case, the pacing becomes sluggish and dialogue heavy, and the tempo heaves to a crawl. Yet here is where DC might have considered making some of its additionswe don't see what the Joker saw, we don't experience any personability to his origins; we find out everything from him heaving more dialogue onto his criminal partners. It's like reading flavor text in an RPGit comes, we process it, the story trudges onward. It has little impact.

Back to the present day, we get to observe Jim Gordon's awful, terrible, really bad day. He's stripped and collared and haunted by pictures of his naked and gunned down daughter, though the passage of time is somewhat unclear here as opposed to the long, torturous procession demonstrated in the comic. This section feels oddly rushedbut still, Batman inevitably comes, plucks his old friend from a cage, and finds the father figure unbroken by Joker's plea to madness. It gives him strength to find and subdue Joker.

Throughout, what we are greeted with is a movie of uneven pacing but dedicated delivery. Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy are, by now, masters of their characters and on point with deliveryeven if the lines themselves can, at points, seem rather off. Some animation hiccups arise here and there which are definitely distracting and a bit odd, while the acts of the movie feel as if two separate teams sat down at the end of the day and handed in their respective homework.

The first act is a mess that leaves us stumbling into the actual storyand, in truth, seems to have no effect on that story at all. The second act suffers from stop-and-go momentum, at times barreling forward out of control and at some points drifting lazily down a river of monologue. For all that, the second act is at least faithful to its source material, with some truly killer lines and marvelous interactions between Batman and Joker, but adds nothing to the talethough it's the part that certainly could have stood to have bits added, played around with, adopted to modern times.

One thing that does stand out and stand up to the test of time, though: that ending scene. It really showcases the acting power Hamill and Conroy bring to the table and the dialogue gleams like a polished knife. It captivates and makes perfect its final thrustthe joke on which the whole story rests.

Yet as much as I dislike the opening act, I should have liked to see it given some sort of connection and resolution here, before the show wraps. Batman saves Gordon from his bad day and offers to save the Joker from his perpetual one, but he doesn't mention all that has happened to Barbara. For all that they apparently shared and his harshness to her throughout, he doesn't make things right between them or take all that she has suffered and make an effort to atone. She ceases to existmaking the whole point of examining her character, playing up the emotional quality between them, leveling her human playing fieldabsolutely moot. It's a baffling oversight that should leave more than merely casual watchers scratching their heads.

My conclusion? This one should've been left to the pages, even if it would've deprived us of one more chance to bask in voice acting perfection.",1470873600,,8084,4.753033547466096

This allows Batgirl to face the abyss and see what Batman sees all the time.  As for the part that comes from the book.  I felt the same way when I read the shooting as I did when I saw the part in the movie.  The tear down of Gordon,was a little hard to watch, but it is what gives it the ending a better feel. Mark Hamill gives  such depth to the lines during the torment of Gordon and the challenge to Batman.  1/2 through the credits is a part to watch.

Joker was try to show that one real bad day can drive one mad.  His was shown in the flashbacks.  He tries to give said bad day to Jim Gordon, by shooting Barbara and then taking him on a ride to drive him mad.  This fails, for in the end Gordon is the same by the book man he was even with what the Joker did to him and his daughter.  The ending comes 1/2 credits.  It shows that even though Barbara had a realy bad day, she did not got mad.  She got to work.",1470700800,3,1354,3.8974358974358974

It has some almost too dark parts, and won't fit you if you're the social justice type, and they did manage to screw up Batgirl a little bit but I still think the entire movie captures the eternal problems between Batman and Joker. The unusual ending was something I appreciated the more I thought about it (not that there was anything thoughtful, it just got funnier as the days went on), and the lines and voice acting were spectacular.

As with most things, the novel is better than the movie, but if you aren't a comic book reading type and just like watching animated Batman films then this is a good one.",1470614400,,652,4.433333333333334

7465294,2,B0169PXGUA,"Saw this in the theater. It's bad.

It's not that the concepts themselves are bad, either. The idea of juxtaposing a new villain obsessed with Batgirl against the Joker/Batman relationship is a good one. Playing on Barbara demanding more from Batman than he can give, both of them being confused about the shape their affection for each other should take? Also a great thing to explore. But that plot requires deft writing and execution, and the execution here lacks dexterity or subtlety. You can see what they were trying to hit, but they missed by miles.

The second half, which follows the Killing Joke story closely, just serves to highlight how poorly Killing Joke has aged. Literally every single woman in the story is either a circus freak or there for a sexual purpose. The villains make no sense if you've never seen the 1932 film Freaks. And so much of the dialogue, which leaps off the page so richly, just sounds leaden when spoken aloud.

It's not all bad: Hamill's joker is better than ever, as is Conroy. It's just a bummer they're going out with a whimper like this. The art, while toned down from the comic, still has a lot of that intentionally jarring 4-color offensiveness when it's really amping up the crazy.

7465295,1,B0169PXGUA,"DC took one of the best comic books of all time, Killing Joke, and ruined it by adding a forty minute first half, that's bafflingly horrible Beyond that -- it is so grossly out of character for batman and batgirl, you wonder if it was intentionally so. Are they just trying to make everything Zack Snydery_ dark, and mean, and petty, and rapey? DC is taking these great characters, and making garbage with them.

It's hard to even believe it, but -- in this ""Killing Joke"" Batgirl is only batgirl because she wants to sleep with batman. Which she does. on a roof. then batman never wants to see her again, even when batgirl tells him ""come on, it's just sex."" And she quits.

so, she's not a hero when Joker shoots her - she's a bimbo, and a quitter, and she's already hung up her cape.

horrible.

powerful and believable.  The storyline was very believable.....if you can find yourself believing that the Joker actually is as crazy as he has always been portrayed to be. Now I never read the comic book so I can't make a true comparison to which was better.  I thought the focus on Batgirl was very relevant since what happened to her was  shocking and made more understandable about the feelings that Batman had toward her. I think some people on this review are just a bit too critical considering that this was a stand alone storyline. But I thought that the Joker's intent was as bizarre as he always has been portrayed to be.  To focus on what drove the Joker crazy in the 1st place was unexpected and riveting. That was never explained about who the Joker was and how he got to be as crazy and evil as he is before. I wasn't too crazy about the ending though which is why I only gave it 4 stars ISO 5.

This is one story that is a hard to tell, it has to be one of the best Graphic Novels of our time, for a film to live up to it would be difficult. Batman the Killing Joke movie will keep you on the edge of your seat it delivers plenty of action with a well drivin story i would have to say i was impressed with the adaptation of Batman the Killing Joke from novel to film. The film starts out strong and carries its self very well the. All this said i will have to say i truly hoped Batman the Killing Joke would stay true to the first print of the graphic novel and it did well to deliver,  i was surprised in the execution of the film. I would recommend this movie to any comic book fan or Batman fan, i would rate Batman the Killing Joke a solid 8.5 out of 10, the movie just falls short of the graphic novel because of just one scene if it would have been done correctly Batman the Killing Joke would have been a 10 out of 10, but the scene that was incorrectly potrayed hurt the film this scene was important to the Graphic novel and mystery of Batman The Killing Joke .

7465339,2,B0169PXGUA,"Technically, this animated film based on the famous graphic novel The Killing Joke is near perfect. The artwork is fine and Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill expertly reprise their roles as Batman and the Joker, respectively. Unfortunately, the story lacks any sort of cathartic pay-off and that is a major deficiency for a tale as raw and unforgiving as this one. The flaw lies in the last scene, in which Batman inexplicably tries to nurture the Joker as if he were some poor, lost soul standing on the brink of the abyss.  This despite the fact that the Joker has just spent the better part of the film defiling and degrading two of Batman's closest allies, Batgirl and Commissioner Gordon.  This brutal behavior demands retribution, but instead of a satisfying pay-off, Batman not only pleads with his homicidal nemesis to basically make love not war, he actually listens to the Clown Prince of Crime as he tells a stale joke and then laughs with him as the picture fades to black. It was such a let down. One might argue the filmmakers wanted to stay true to the source material, but major liberties are taken throughout this film which deviates dramatically from Alan Moore's graphic novel.  So why not tweak the ending to give a more satisfying resolve to one of the darkest tales in the Batman cannon? As it stands the ending just doesn't work and that kills this entire endeavor.",1470528000,,1383,4.706611570247934

Based on the famous graphic novel written by Alan Moore, this movie seems to have caused some mixed emotions among fans with the biggest talking point being the addition of the ""Batgirl prologue"" (for want of a better term) before we get to the story proper. Unlike many, I don't have an issue with this sequence and feel that it kind of makes sense given what becomes of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl later.
When we get to the meat of the story, it's a faithful and accurate adaptation of the graphic novel in both story and the style of animation.

7465343,1,B0169PXGUA,"This was the worst graphic novel turned into film Ive ever seen. Like many others, I am a big fan of Alan Moores graphic novel from the 80s.  I had high hopes for this film.  I invited a friend to watch it who isn't a huge fan of the superhero genre and about 15 minutes in I was embarrassed that I had done so.  We kept checking the time on the film waiting for the Joker to appear.  A full 15 minutes passed that had nothing to do with Moores book and seemed to be setting up sympathy for Batgirl.  It never tied into the main story at all.  Did Barbara Gordon really need this explained?  The woman is out there putting her life on the line fighting criminals the police couldn't take down. We kept pulling up the display looking at the time left in the film and wondering how long before this trainwreck would end.

And the horrible message it sent that Batgirl attracts psychopaths because of how she acts and dresses?  That it insinuated she was asking for what the Joker did to her?  Sure, and I guess DC feels that women wearing short skirts in bars are inviting rape.  What were they thinking?  Women are only fit to fight crime from behind a desk?  A slap in the face to our female officers around the nation.  What happened in the novel was a tragedy; what happened in the film was a disgrace to the character and her integrity.

Some of the animation such as in the fun house was nicely done, but overall most of it looked like computer generated hacks as if the whole thing had been conceived in Adobe Flash.  Some of the iconic panels appear to have been taken and slapped into the film in motion comic style.  Except these were done much worse.  It reminded me of the  Marvel Superhero animated features from the 60s where they took a still shot of a hero like Captain America and made his mouth move.  Dont waste your time on this.

I understand they were faced with two issues in turning The Killing Joke into a movie: it's length and it's narrow focus. I also understand they really really wanted to include Batgirl as a more important character in the story, but the means they chose to do this simply falls flat. The first act is just a lukewarm attempt to create a parallel for the the Batman-Joker dynamic with Batgirl and some generic Made-For-TV movie bad boy-villain. The problem is that it just isn't very original, the bad guy isn't very intriguing and it feels like what it is: filler. It simply adds NOTHING to the original story aside from time. I won't mention the ridiculous culmination of the story, but it is so forced and cliched and totally out of character that it actually had me almost hurting something from the epic eye-roll. When they get around to actually doing The Killing Joke it is much more enjoyable.

7465355,2,B0169PXGUA,"To begin with, this is an age and era where animation has broken through into a dramatic and breathtaking art form. With this thought in mind, this movie falls fatally on its face with in the first few moments of footage. After the opening shot of the city, the all too familiar style of Batman: The Animated series (aired from 1992 - 1995) shows it head.  While the animation style that started  that series  was not a poor one, as budget feel from the series it became simple and plain in shape and form. This dry and uncomplicated style is the quality of art to expect from this film. The Joker's costume is so simple in form they didn't even bother to give him a proper collar on his shirt. The reason this hurts this film so inherently, is the true beauty of the graphic novel this is based on.  Comparing the graphic novel to this movie in art form leaves one speechlessly disappointed after just the first few moments of story.
 Next, the sub-plot of Batgirl's and Batman's relationship adds no interest to the story, other than perhaps to add some shock value to the brutal crimes which follows these characters. However, as brutal of a story as the graphic novel is, this feels almost like a young adult version of the story with a strongly suggested sex scene thrown in and a couple of bullets through a couple of people's heads. While that may sound horrible (considering what can be done with this medium of cinematography) it lacks effect and thusly losses its impact. Overall, in the end, the horrors of this story tumble to the ground with minor emotional effect. Also, the subplots slowed the story and changed the incredible pace of the original graphic novel. Everyone I watched this with pondered over the R rating of the film and could not think of a single reason this didn't get a PG-13 rating instead.
 Joker's memories are also poorly executed from a transitional sense. In the graphic novel it makes it very clear you are looking back into the Joker's past and in this film it fails to show what is triggering these memories  that he is having. In fact, the point of Joker's memories are almost irrelevant to the film version. This is sad because they spent so much time on a nearly twenty minute short plot before they even begin the story contained within the graphic novel.  Sadly, they rushed the story of The Killing Joke spending only about forty-five minutes of that story.
 Voice acting also falls short considering the great actors who give birth to these characters. While Mark Hamill is a brilliant Joker, even his acting feels forced through the film. Background sounds and music also leave much to be desired.
 To finalize on the story and film itself, the script has been so poorly altered that it comes out being battered and bruised. The animation fails to live up to any modern expectation of animation and the important artistic flair required for this film is simply nonexistent.
 For a quick review of the bluray: Audio and picture are both clear and well balanced, but there's simply not as much of it as one would hope. I do think if you are going to purchase this film I would go with the bluray hands down. However, I am certainly not supporting buying this in any way. Go out and rent it.

7465369,1,B0169PXGUA,"The things about The Killing Joke that it's most known for is that it's the closest thing we have ever got from DC to an origins story for The Joker and the shooting of Barbara Gordon (Batgirl).  Beyond those things, the story is pretty much your typical Batman vs. Joker story.  Maybe a bit darker than most, but still, it's Batman vs. The Joker and not even close to being the best of the many battles they've had.  If you've read the graphic novel that The Killing Joke is based on, you essentially know what to expect, as the film follows the graphic novel really close.... the moment The Killing Joke actually begins, which is about 25 minutes into the film.  My problem with the film is that instead of using that new 25 minutes to bulk up and polish an already great story; perhaps giving us even more on The Joker's origins, the film makers decided we needed to know more about Batgirl's feelings toward her mentor, Batman, which felt tacted on and very unnecessary to me.  By now, you probably know there is a new scene involving Batgirl and Batman that was very out-of-character for both and which I felt added nothing to the story.  It came across to me as a desperate attempt by the film makers to add controversy in hopes to get people talking.  And yes, it has people talking.  Not about The Killing Joke part of the film, which maybe was their intention, since that wasn't their creation to begin with, but that one, unnecessary, out-of-character scene that will hopefully end up as being forgetable, as I felt it more so damages the man and the legacy of Batman more than it helps.  For that reason, for that wasted use of 25 minutes, I cannot recommend this film.  If you're interested in The Killing Joke, read the graphic novel.

If this is both Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamil last Batman voice over then they weren't sent out on top! The color, character drawings, the look of the definition as you watch it on television was the only positive feedback I can give it; excellent film quality was projected. Now the story goes all over the place and I can't quite grasp what was the plot. What I can tell you is that the ending was absolutely, 100% corny. It was like a give up on the writing. The writer lost his imagination and couldn't make a better ending that would've been a real ""killing Joke."" Deeply disappointed.

7465393,4,B0169PXGUA,"Okay, so this story is one of the hallmarks of the whole Batman mythos. And it is past due to be translated into a animated feature. We all had high hopes when we saw the awesome job they did with ""The Dark Knight Returns"".
The problem is, they didn't actually start the story until 31 minutes in. Prior to that, they explore Barbara Gordon's story as Batgirl.
Now, I don't have an issue with that. The book is kind of short, and just a direct adaption would have made for a fairly short feature. But, as I am sure you already know, Bruce Wayne and Barbara Gordon... how can I put this delicately... they hook up.
Why? Is DC and Warner Bros on the wacky baccy? Barbara is Nightwing's girl, not Batman's. It is downright creepy to see that. Batman was a mentor, and Batgirl was more like a daughter, I am sure Barbara was depicted as being over 18, but still... As one reviewer stated it, the ""ick"" factor is almost unbearable to those who read the books and know their genuine relationship.
But, if the actual adaption is what you want to see, I'd just forget that whole thing and fast forward to 31 minutes, and you will see Batman drive up to the gates of Arkham, just like in the book. At this point, the movie gets decent, following the book fairly closely. It is a mess until, though.
At 31 minutes, you have a decent adaption and an entertaining production.
By the way, the animation was a little less smooth than we've come to expect. Almost a throwback to the original animated series and the original animated series of movies.

The relationship between Bruce and Barbara was forced and awkward. Plus, I have immense difficulty viewing Bruce to allow that sort of relationship (this isn't All Star Batman and Robin). Besides, we all know she's more interested in Dick Grayson than Batman.

I am a die hard DC fan, and have a great love for all of Gotham and it's people. I would say that this is a story mostly about the relationship that joker shares with Batman, along side a new pre-story about Batgirl.

The previews play up the best parts of the film and this story just never came together between the first 25 or so minutes of the film and the rest of it.

And for the life of me, I can not figure out why this was rated R. I think the other recent PG13 Batman films were more graphic than this. I can only assume it was to build hype for those of us wanting a graphic translation of the original story to film. And a hardcore Batman film finally...

They did try to do something new in the first 20 minutes of the movie by adding an additional Batgirl arc, that was never in the Killing Joke comic, but I found it very distasteful, completely unnecessary and an absolute insult to the Batgirl/Batman friendship.  The ""real"" Killing Joke Story actually begins after the first 20 minutes and they pretty much follow it accurately, but as I mentioned earlier, I might as well read it off the graphic novel instead.

Any TKJ fan, or Batman fan knows that the novel itself is beautiful, simple, but unfortunately short.  I really appreciate the fact that instead of diluting/changing/ or messing with TJK storyline from the novel, they decided to add somewhat of a prologue to develop one of the characters a little more and create more of an urgency.

Batman: The Killing Joke

Directed by Sam Liu, written by Brian Azzarello and stars the voices of Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Tara Strong and Ray Wise.

Based on the graphic novel of the same name by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland.

The Story: As Batman hunts for the escaped Joker, the Clown Prince of Crime attacks the Gordon family to prove a diabolical point mirroring his own fall into madness (From IMDB).

The Review: Batman and the Joker have had countless confrontations over the decades. Some silly, some famous. One of the most legendary duels between the Dark Knight and the Clown Prince of Crime is the Killing Joke.

Lets get the first part of the way. This movie starts off quite poorly. It shows the newly minted Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, investigating a up and coming mobster who has an infatuation with with her. She gets in over her head and when Batman tries to prevent her from going over the edge, she ends up having angry sex with him. Uhwhat!?

That is a common reaction to that development. What is tragic about it, is that this was designed to make Barbara a better character.

In popular media, there is a phenomenon called Women in Refrigerators or fridging a character. It got its name from comic books but it encompasses almost all media. It occurs when a female character is tortured/raped/killed/put on the bus by the story for no other purpose than to motivate the usually male lead. This is exactly what happens in original story, Barbara Gordon is shot and paralyzed by the Joker in order to make her stop being Batgirl and to motivate Batman. Even Alan Moore himself states that he regrets treated Barbara Gordon in such a manner.

The thing isthis actually led to one of DCs most important character developments. Barbaranow deprived of walking, was forced to turn her mind toward crime-fighting, becoming the hacker hero Oracle. That was a good idea, not to mention the positive portrayal of the disabled alongside and intelligent women

This movie tries and fails with Barbara Gordon. For the first half-hour or so of the movie, it was watching a whole other movie about Batgirl. Reelworm kept asking himself, Wheres Joker? This supposed to be the Joker story for many fans.

The worst part is that Barbara is not a main character in the original source material. While receiving criticisms for its now dated portrayal of women, the Killing Joke remains a classic of the comic book and one of the quintessential texts of the Batman Canon. Why?

Not for the portrayal of Barbara but the relationship between Batman and the Joker.

Fiction is full of rivalries and one of the most famous pairings is the Batman and the Joker. It stands to reason that if taking a random survey, most people would remember the Joker being the arch-nemesis of Batman, and would not know who Supermans or Wonder Womans were. (Lex Luthor and Cheetah, respectively). Thats because the dynamic between the Dark Knight and the Clown Prince of Crime is so perfect. Many have said that the Joker is the perfect foil to a character like Batman. Its truethey are linked, two sides of the same coin. Order vs Chaos, Logic vs Madness, Comedy and Tragedy. That is what defines Joker and the Batman

While Batman is currently befuddled at his relationships,(Thats why they expanded Batgirls part!) he goes on the topic of his most intimate relationshipJoker. Batman is pondering how this will all play out, the endgame of the twisted bond they share. It has often been remarked that Batman was the closest thing Joker had to a friend.

How the two are alike yet different. Both suffered tragedy and lost their loved ones and it really was a coin flip at the moment. Its not to much of a stretch to thing Bruce Wayne could have gone down the same path as the unnamed comedian that became the Joker.

But as he sayshis past is preferred as multiple choice.

This even extends to beyond the 4th wall as well. In Real-World, the most iconic portrayals of Batman and Joker of a generations are Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill. There are certainly Reelworms default versions of the character. It no doubt delighted many, to hear that the dynamic duo were together again. Unfortunately, as dynamic as this duo is, the interpretation falls flat. Unlike earlier projectsthis one seems to lack heart. A mere cash grab.

Final Verdict: Its a bit tricky to assign and rating to this one because there are simultaneous good six sections mixed in with pretty bad ones. While the second half is much better, even Reelworm felt some parts were lacking compared to the original text and other projects, such as Jokers Monologue. If one is a fan of Batman and/or animated superheroes, they should definitely give it a watch but it is unlikely this interpretation will be as famous as the graphic novel.

Three Bats out of Five.

If there was ever a reason to kill the Joker it was in this DVD.  Instead, both Batman and the Joker were both portrayed way out of character.  Me and my kid enjoy almost all of these DC comics DVD's, but I'm giving this one away at our next garage sale.  I wouldn't feel right selling it to anyone.",1470182400,2,445,4.176470588235294
7465438,2,B0169PXGUA,"I was really looking forward to this considering I love the book and the voice actors involved.  I was slightly let down before the film was even released because of the animation, which looked like it was one notch above the old Animated Series.  Right away it seemed as though we weren't doing justice to the book here, and if you compare this film to the artwork of Brian Bolland, it's not even a comparison.  The movie does suffer for it.  Some highlight scenes with the Joker just don't work and lose their emotional weight.  The ending is also a victim of this sadly.

I didn't mind the opening prologue with Barbara, I just thought the story could've been far better.  I was very surprised Brian Azzarello wrote this.  It's nothing like what I thought he'd come up with, although it's hard to tell what he was and wasn't allowed to do.  The movie seems torn between including violence and acid-tongued dialogue from the Joker in order to stay faithful to the graphic novel, while at the same time employing an art style that doesn't jive with those things:  punches land weakly, characters severely lack expression and detail in their faces, and frankly even simple animations like walking come off stiff.

This movie simply fails to capture what made the book great.  I cannot stress enough the importance of experiencing this story through its original medium instead of on film.  Everything that made the book a success is severely dulled here, and I don't even think they understood the ending judging by how it was shot.",1470182400,,1532,4.714285714285714

7465452,5,B0169PXGUA,All I have to say is that initially you feel the movie is just another Batman story. I know that sounds blasphemous especially since he is my favorite hero. But the last few minutes poetically brings everything together. It is disturbing and yet not disturbing; it is wrong and yet right. The dual nature of the Batman and the Joker's matures shows that insanity can itself be manifested in different ways. Love and other basic human emotions can have their place even amongst the madness. Great job to everyone involved.,1470182400,,521,4.8
7465453,2,B0169PXGUA,"It seems that anyone and everyone who has seen this - ""professional entertainment"" reviewers, online personalities, comic writers, new Batman fans, old Batman fans - all have the same base opinion that this isn't a good movie. But the real problem is that they all come from various backstories as to why this movie isn't any good, and they all mostly focus on the wrong points as to why.

Most ""trendy reviewers"" (your random Entertainment Weekly and non-comic specific column writers) will say that the comic in itself is flawed, and that basing a movie on the source material could never produce anything viewed as ""good"" in this day and age. Online personalities will vary depending on their own unique history with the character, and you'll hear everything from ""The first 30 minutes ruins the entire movie"" to ""DC comics as a whole are screwing their franchises up across all mediums."" And the old/new fans generally focus on the comic instead of the movie itself, again scrutinizing on whether the original story is something that can/should/would exist in today's market.

And it's in the latter that you realize that we're all living in a sad age of arguing over equality - blaming older comic book stories for having a lack of ""proper writing ideas"" that are fair to all races and sexes - and it seems modern fan opinions are easily dismissive of older stories that don't ""round out"" basic writing points of relationships like today's stories do (promoting ""girl power"", making sure that gays/lesbians all have a wedge cut out for their groups, showing that females ""can be"" and ""are"" better than their male counterparts, etc). And the truth is that The Killing Joke was never about anything more or less than Batman, Gordon and The Joker (whether people want to accept that or not). When reviewers only focus on the movies problems by focusing on the source material it's the same as saying ""I don't like Rock n' Roll music because I don't like guitars""... If you don't like it, you're not ever gonna like it, and you gotta ask yourself ""why should I care?"" If you start harping on the older story and want to say that changing certain elements (Batgirl being a footnote / or in the case of Rock n' Roll - the guitars being in a song), then guess what? It stops being what it is and always has been because you're changing its core elements.

So then why is the movie bad for the sake of the movie being bad? Well, there's a lot of problems. It should have been animated better, and it should have had better screen writers, and it should have stayed at whatever low run time that only focused on the source material and nothing else - it's all the fans of the comic would ever ask for. Yet sadly, 95% of this movies turmoil with reviewers and fans is because of Bruce Timm's odd fascination with having Batman and Batgirl as a sexual couple, which does the KJ story no favors. Instead of creating a decent subplot to the main story, he effectively turned back the dial for sexual equality by turning Batgirl into nothing more than a boy-starved little girl, who's safe-zone gay friend at work allows her to vent trivial issues of sex to. He even pushes this stereotype further into the main story when Batgirl is night jogging in skin tight sweats, showing off her rear-end and ample bust size just to make sure that you don't forget she's a sexual object instead of a blank pawn in the Joker's game. It's ridiculous. And honestly, if Timm wanted to create a story based on Bat-family relationships, then by all means go for it. But it should have stayed far, far away from this movie.

And what's very clear is that people ignore the weak animation department as a whole because they hearken back to the animated days when Batman TAS, Superman TAS, and JL were dominate, and they still want to think that DC animation today is somehow attached to the former's standard; that DC animated is untouchable. But be real. Can you really point to any animation passed Teen Titans (not Go!) and say that DC animation is the end all be all anymore? Okay, maybe Young Justice and Go!. But DC's animated movies have been sub par since Timm was first taken off of the main panel of animation decision makers for their movies (maybe around the new52 Justice League: War release?), and this Killing Joke is just a product of the current DC system pumping out animated stories with no real care or heart to them. Maybe if KJ was released around the same time when Under the Red Hood, Wonder Woman, All Star Superman (etc) came then it could have stood a chance in the quality department. But instead, we get animated frames that look jittery, a color palette that wants to match other current new52 DC movies instead of what the comic looked like, and scenes that only loosely resemble their comic counterparts instead of genuinely recreating the visuals of any single frame. In all honesty, it just feels like DC's biggest fault is that they think all their movies are automatically going to be great and that any changes done to the source material story is all for the best because the comic market today demands it.",1470096000,2,5117,4.63215859030837

I also wish they had depicted what so many suspect took place after The Joker told the ""Killing Joke"".

This should have started where the book started, where Batman is interrogating the fake Joker. After the ridiculous Batgirl scenes and the affair with Batman, and you see Batman starting to talk to the fake Joker, that's when the mood and attitude shifted. That's when this started to get good. It starts to get creepy and you  will be a battle between sanity and chaos.
This movie is pretty much scene for scene and word for word from the graphic novel. I admire the dedication to source material.
Very rare these days. The animation is very slick and there are a lot of nods to Batman covers and even the the classic Joker grabbing his hair and laughing, this was used in the ad for the book back when it was coming out. Very cool.
I recommend this to hardcore Batman fans. I think they could have merged a few other Joker stories instead of the useless Batgirl filler in the beginning. Nothing new added. It's worth a rental. Had I seen this before purchasing I would not have bought it. I can't recommend.",1470096000,2,1324,4.471074380165289
7465459,1,B0169PXGUA,"The writers, directors, and producers managed to take a problematic yet powerful story and make it simultaneously tremendously more problematic and less powerful. They altered the basic character of every major DC character depicted and missed every possible emotional resonance that could have excused or explained it.

The writers managed to create a film that was tone-deaf with respect to issues around sex, sexism, rape, relationships, insanity, physical deformity, and fatherhood while also giving it a tedious plot, boring supporting characters, and entirely bland visuals. They couldn't even make a carnival run by the Joker the least bit scary.

If you like Barbara Gordon / Batgirl / Oracle, do not see this movie.
If you like Batman, do not see this movie.
If you like Commissioner Gordon, do not see this move.
If you like the Joker, do not see this movie.

7465461,5,B0169PXGUA,"The first 28 minutes and 15 seconds is basically a modern episode of Bruce Timm's classic Batman: The Animated Series. Unless you are a huge fan of Batgirl I highly recommend just skipping it. Not that I have anything against her, I've actually been a fan since a kid after seeing her in the 1966 Batman TV series, it just does nothing to quantify the actual Killing Joke storyline except for fleshing out her character a bit. Watch this first part like an extra or bonus episode. You might just thank me for it 
The actual Killing Joke feature itself, which is about 48 minutes long, is just excellent. With the exception of some creative liberties towards the conclusion regarding Joker's ""henchmen,"" most notably a decisive battle with a certain infamous trio, this feature is very true to the graphic novel. In addition there are several Easter eggs that even the hardcore Batman fan might miss without looking them up on the Internet; I got lucky when I suddenly paused one frame also at the end. What has to be the biggest draw to this feature simply has to be Mark Hamill. He does his best voice acting, I would argue maybe his best acting period, in this run as Joker. If you have ever owned any of the Batman movies, seen the recent or older animated features then you owe it to yourself to at least see this if not add it to your collection. Hope I proved my point.

7465489,3,B0169PXGUA,"If you really want to experience ""The Killing Joke"" buy the graphic novel. It's near perfect. This animated version of the story was disappointing.

Two things really dampened the film for me, the big one being the first third of the film. I get why they added the Barbara as batgirl story because the novel was so short and they wanted more character development for Her before the incident. It just didn't work, not at all. The second thing I had a problem with was the way they handled the ending. In the novel they handled the tension of the final act a lot better. Especially on the final joke. Everything was rushed and the tension that I really enjoyed on those final iconic pages of laughter in the novel just wasn't there. Batman still looks calm and controlled instead of holding the joker by the shirt not knowing if he's going to lose it on the Joker or not.

Without the two main problems I find disrail the film, there is a lot to be praised. Mainly the voice acting. My God do Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy kill it. Their work is brilliant and Its great to hear the two legends back at it. The Joker's monologues were by far my favorite part of the film. The other thing I really enjoyed was how good the adaption actually was excluding the first third of the film and the final scene. From the moment Batman walks in to the prison the film is page for page what happens in the novel.

Why would he sleep with her knowing that Dick Grayson loves her? Or that she is Gordon's daughter? Not including the fact that she is ten years or so younger than Bruce. I still enjoy the classic Batman animated series, but this one movie is a mess. Bruce Timm and Bryan Azarello are amazing, but this project failed big time.

The beginning of the film is not from the original comic and is the weakest part of the movie. It was put in in order to develop some relationships and foreshadow some future events, this part is not necessarily bad its just not nearly as compelling and thrilling as the last two thirds of the movie. If you're wanting this movie to do justice to the amazing character that is Barbra Gordon you will disappointed. This story isn't a Batgirl story, this movie is a Batman and Joker story. It displays how complicated these two characters actually are and how they effect one another. I really enjoyed the movie over all. The added padding which in the end just served to extend the run time of the movie wasn't all bad and was still entertaining enough for me to sit through. I'm no sound engineer but the sound mixing felt satisfying and did a good job of enhancing the experience especially when it came to the fighting sound effects. Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy are stellar as always and make it hard to imagine anyone else playing these characters.

7465513,4,B0169PXGUA,"SPOILER ALERT (These warnings are lame).

The reviews that complain about the first part of this movie focus on how the Batgirl segment was completely unnecessary and detracted from the otherwise excellent graphic novel, may have missed a point. These reviewers did not see that although Commissioner Gordon was the Joker's target to prove anyone (especially the Commissioner) needs just ""One bad day"" to go completely mad, missed the fact there were TWO people who did not go mad.

Who was the second?

Batman.

Although the Batgirl story line was added to make the movie...a movie. It showed how much Batman actually had feelings for Barbara and even after she was brutalized he did not pulverize (or kill) the Joker for this particular violent crime. Batman captured the Joker not just at the Commissioner's urging, but he too had the mindset and moral standards to not cross the line and fall into the abyss no matter how bad a day anyone has.

This graphic novel to fully animated feature film was a very good adaptation and stayed true to the main storyline. The animation style may not be up to the expensive cgi graphics by today's ""standards"", but it remained true to the excellent animated series style of animation.

Highly recommended.",1470096000,3,1247,4.886255924170616
7465514,3,B0169PXGUA,"I like most Batman comics fans was really looking forward to this adaption.  The fascinating thing about the graphic novel is that it delves into the idea that one bad day can be the difference between someone becoming a good guy or a bad guy.  Bruce Wayne had his traumatic moment and became Batman.  The man that continues to be unnamed had his traumatic moment, and became the Joker.  One bad day, both characters had their own psychological breakdowns, two different results.  One dealt with it one way and one the other.  This was the fascinating message within the graphic novel, and concepts like this is what makes characters in the Batman mythos so fascinating.  All Batman characters are all layered in so many ways, and gives them all life.  This film just misses it...It's not a bad movie, but the whole concept of that traumatic moment leading to a psychological breakdown is touched on but is missed in so many ways.  The connection that they try to give Batman to Batgirl in the beginning which is supposed to give purpose to what we all believed would be the death of the Joker at the end of the film (as it was in the graphic novel) is taken away for a pat on the back.  This just makes those moments in the beginning of the film seem so pointless.  I mean cmon, if Batman really cared for Batgirl, and we were truly following the psychological breakdown theme Batman would have reacted the same way he did in the comics at the end of the film, it would just make sense.  Its sad the makers of this film got so close to understanding what was so awesome about The Killing Joke graphic novel, just to really lose it with that ending.  If your a Batman fan by all means watch the movie, but make sure you read the graphic novel.  Dont judge the greatness of the book by this poor adaption of it.

I found the treatment of women in the movie to be commendable. My only real gripe with the movie as I tried to explain to the kids was the Batman and Batgirl sex scene.

7465518,2,B0169PXGUA,"I was really really hyped up for this movie, especially when Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill were announced to voice Batman and Joker. However, the movie just fails. It's not good.

The entire first act of the movie is solely a Batgirl movie. Batgirl is clearly the main character and protagonist. And furthermore, this isn't a continuation of anything; it's a stand-alone movie, so the Batgirl world we're thrown into is hard to care about, from the beginning. She's been making mistakes and can't handle the stress of being Batgirl, but we really don't get to see much of that, unlike if this was a sequel movie in a series. Her main antagonist seems to be a criminal who is stalking her and obsessed with her and the multiple influences of stress is causing her to both do her job as Batgirl poorly, as well as put her own life in danger. None of this *really* matters though, as it's just a (bad) attempt to set-up emotional gravitas to what happens later.

The second act involves Batman coming to the conclusion that sooner or later, he and The Joker going to kill the other someday. However, The Joker has already (somehow) broken out of Arkham and goes on to do what he's known for best in this graphical novel adaptation. But the gravitas of what he does to Barbara Gordon/Batgirl really doesn't mean much, or anything at all. Especially since they spend so long in the second act focusing on Batman and Joker. By the time we finally come back to Barbara/Batgirl, we as the audience, have already forgotten about her and moved on. Her entire story arc was basically done, by this point. Her entire storyline really does feel like a separate movie, even with the shoehorned love-making scene she and Batman have on the rooftop after Batman tries to ""fire"" her.

Anyway, Barbara is taken down and Commissioner Gordon is kidnapped by The Joker in his plot to prove that anyone can go mad with just ""one bad day."" However, none of Joker's intentions are really shown very well or clearly. Everything is *told* to us, but never really shown. In fact, his entire plot seems to make little sense, the way it's told in the movie. Solely because they do very little to actually set it up well. I mean, it makes sense that The Joker would do such a thing, but *why* he's doing it is never told. Christopher Nolan seemed to do a MUCH better job setting up Joker's intentions of ""anyone can go mad and do bad things"" in the third act of The Dark Knight involving the civilian boat vs the criminal boat with the bombs. That's all I could think of in watching this: being reminded of the same premise in a much better movie. And despite all that's happened to him, Gordon seems to be pretty calm and collected when Batman rescues him. Oh, and there's an out-of-place musical number involving The Joker and his hired goons of (unintentionally sympathetic) circus freaks. Keep in mind, this movie is supposed to have an R-rating and literally not a single thing in the movie warrants it; the musical number shown here actually seems to make it seem like it's for kids. Even in the R-rating, they don't seem to have the balls to outright say that the Joker raped or intended to rape Barbara Gordon and instead, have to subtly imply he did or was planning to. Again, not only makes the R-rating pointless, but the entire third act felt like a (lesser) episode of the Batman Animated Series from the early 90's. If they cut out the entire first act with Batgirl, it probably would've come off just like that.

Anyway, in the final act, there is barely a fight or climax of any real sort between Batman and The Joker and the movie ends with The Joker's ""killing joke"" and Batman just laughs at it in the rain. Never mind that he just ended Barbara Gordon's Batgirl career, never mind the psychological trauma he attempted to put her father through, never mind what he said earlier in the movie about eventually having to kill The Joker because he's just too dangerous and deadly to be kept alive... it just ends abruptly with Batman laughing at the 'killing' joke. And even *if* this is how the graphic novel would've ended, they've already taken so many liberties with the movie, that them not changing this doesn't make sense. Assuming this movie had any sort of logic to it, Batman should've beaten Joker withing an inch of his life, but not killed him, thus proving Joker's theory wrong. This seems like the natural conclusion of what they were *trying* to set up, anyway. (By the way, this movie is supposed to be rated R. Did I mention that?)

In short, the whole movie feels like a disconnected mess. Everything feels like a mix of the director's interpretative vision combined with a loose, poor attempt to retell the graphic novel. This movie is simply poorly directed, badly written, and the pacing is way off and disjointed. I had high hopes for this film, but it's not very good.

Unfortunately the prologue adds nothing to the story, and it takes nothing away, the whole reason behind it, I'm sure you'll all know, is the creators of the film wanted to add more emotion to Batgirl, and her connection with Bruce Wayne/Batman, which like I said, the prologue (this is all personal opinion) adds nothing to the story, but it takes nothing away.

The comic book is one of those stories that sticks with you forever.  Once youve read it, you will not forget it.  The imagery is just too powerful, but the events in The Killing Joke are even more shocking than any other Batman comic.  Even to this day no other Batman book has it beat.  That being said, I recommend reading the book first then go watch the film.  After all, you can get it on Amazon for around 10 bucks.  So the question is, did it live up to the book?

For the most part The Killing Joke movie followed the book pretty well.  The film even kept some of the best quotes from the book.  My personal favorite quote is Sometimes I remember it one way, and sometimes another.  If Im to have a past I prefer multiple choice.  The power in this line demonstrates the uncertainty of the jokers origins.  Perhaps, thats what I find so intriguing about the Joker; his past is wrapped in a mystery.

On the other hand, I found the films beginning a little boring.  The film opens up with a backstory about Bat-Girl where the comic jumps straight into the action.  However, I see why the film makers felt like they needed this extra filler.  Without it the film might had been too short.  Once Bat-Girls backstory is out of the way we dive head first into the epic rivalry between Batman and the Joker. The bottom line is that the film version is a must watch for all Batman and Joker fans.  Nevertheless, I still believe that the book had a bigger impact on me.  With that point, I recommend reading the book first then go watch the film.

7465531,5,B0169PXGUA,"Loved it!  Even liked the Batgirl prologue and hopefully they follow up on it with a new movie battling Paris Franz!  I wonder how they will portray the sex scenes with her in a wheelchair though with Batty or Paris.  Will it be in the chair?  The bed?  A swing?  I can hear the fanboys and fangirls brewing about that argument.  Anyhoo...the Killing Joke was spot on and awesome.  I saw this in the theaters and everyone loved it.  Yes, even the sex scene got claps and whistles.  Who doesn't want to see Barbara's batgirls as she rips off her top?  Get over it.  Don't like that scene, bookmark your Blu-ray up to the start of the Killing Joke and stop crying.  Yes it doesn't make sense and it is totally irrelevant to the Killing Joke story but the higher ups have the power to do crap like this.  But, we get The Killing Joke perfectly done!  Well done to the animation and voices.  This will be a multiple viewing experience.  This Blu-ray didn't have the featurette that they showed at the Fathom Event with the Mark Hamill interview.

7465551,5,B0169PXGUA,"I felt the need to come out and defend this movie. I understand and agree with the criticism this movie is receiving for its first half, but by no means should this be considered a bad film. Ultimately, everyone who purchased this movie wanted to see an animated version of one of the greatest comic books ever published, and they got just that. I gave this movie 5 stars, solely on the last 40 minutes of the film which is the actual Killing Joke animated adaptation.

The last 40 minutes of this movie are a near perfect page by page adaptation of the Killing Joke comic. This was a very difficult film to animate due to the difficulty of translating the art work of the comic to an animated film. I personally believe they delivered the best possible animation allowed within their budget.

The voice casting for this movie is absolutely stellar. Mark Hamill delivers a performance that truly draws you in to the emotions of what the Joker is feeling, and what it is that he's attempting to accomplish. Kevin Conroy is the Batman that we all know in love. He truly brings something special to this character every time he gets a chance to do the role.

If you purchase this movie, do yourself a favor and just watch the last 40 minutes of this film. It is a true art piece, and an amazing animated film adaptation of one of the greatest comic books ever published.",1469836800,7,1367,4.481927710843373

7465559,5,B0169PXGUA,"I saw this movie in theaters for it's limited theatrical run. Before seeing it, I unfortunately read negative reviews saying this movie was ""the worst DC adaptation yet"" which is far from true, in my honest opinion. The first 30 minutes or so, yeah, there's reasons to complain about it. I found it pointless, boring, and adding nothing to the actual Killing Joke story. I think maybe the first encounter of Barbara and The Joker would have worked better than some mob dealer no one cares about. Or maybe not add anything to the story, instead use that 30 minutes you wasted (in my opinion) on the budget of the actual Killing Joke story. I don't think anyone would have complained seeing a 45 minute movie with way better animation. That's one of my minor gripes, the animation could be off at times. CGI Cars do not look good in this. But aside from that, I loved it. The voice acting is great, the music was great, the animation was great at times. I give the whole movie a 7/10, if you subtract the Batgirl plot a 9/10. This was very faithful to the comic.

One thing I don't understand is people complaining about the ending. I get people think Batman killed The Joker (Batman was the last laughing in the final panel which makes people led to think he choked him out.) but his hands were on his shoulders. I think Joker stopped laughing because he was in shock that he actually made Batman laugh. I feel like him killing The Joker goes against what the whole story is about... Com. Gordon wanted him brought in by the books... I guess that's what makes the twist so great... it's left pretty ambiguous.

I say this is definitely worth watching if you're a fan of the graphic novel. Maybe skip the first 30 minutes. Maybe make a feature for the blu ray where it cuts it out completely? One can dream, hahaha!",1469664000,2,1813,4.457831325301205
7465560,3,B0169PXGUA,"First a history lesson: Pre-Crisis (before 1986) Batgirl had a crush and Batman that inspired her to take up the mantle. Characterizations were different back then, the entire arc never went anywhere and was a perfectly valid and innocent fluff. Then came the 90s Batman TAS cartoon and Bruce Timm, the producer of this movie, decided to pursue that plot thread further as he was in intrigued by how wrong (a direct quote from the dvd extras) it was. The problem is that the first interaction between Bruce and Barbara on that show was to hand him a teddy bear and that Bruce revealed that he viewed her father as a father figure of his own in the sequel episode I Am the Night. You may now begin to see why fans have complained about this doomed romance for nearly 2 decades and a 2013/14 Batman Beyond comic by Kyle Higgins drove if off a cliff, look it up. I have to bring this up as it will be the only thing this animated film will be known for due to the original 30 minute Batgirl arc at the start. That part of the movie is a top to bottom disaster in all but animation. Tara Strong chosen voice for Batgirl is too old, too aggressive and out of character. Every single creative decision, as her life being driven by men, the gay best friend with relationship advice (wow!) and her utter inability to fight crime shocked me as a 2 decade fan of the character. The new nemesis Paris Franz is another mess and all these decision ultimately fridge her while messing with the main TKJ plot. This is no Barbara I know off but Black Canary from All Star Batman & Robin instead. The already infamous sex scene lines up 1 to 1... Even shippers will question this part of the film and I can only repeat that the rooftop action wasn't the main problem, just one of many. The original 1988 Batgirl one-shot by Barbara Kesel that set up her retirement and served as a prequel to the TKJ comic should have been adapted instead, as a spate short on the disc, to fill the run-time. A thematic double bill with an adaptation of The Man Who Laughs, a one-shot remake of Joker's first appearance, would have worked wonders too. 3,5/10

The titular film is another beast entirely and was my most awaited film of the year. Most of it is a 1 to 1 adaptation with some edged up dialogue on the one hand and some censorship on the other. The film was never intended to get an R-rating according to the film's preview on the last DCU animate release. The producers decided to stick with the rating as a form of promotion and not to censor the film down, as with DKR and Wonder Woman. I find it pointless to go over the film's numerous qualities as the source material is well documented by now and will again stick to flaw. Some of the voice acting was a bit emotionless, even Kevin Conroys delivery. The animator didn't animate the background characters during Joker's flashbacks in a bar. They move in the comic, so it can't be directorial decision to highlight the dreamlike nature if the scene and it stood out due to the phenomenal animation for the rest of the film. WB certainly knows how to do beautiful OVAs on a budget! The film also dances between panels to add run-time and the one panel prostitutes Batman questions now get dialogue that suggest that Joker is a sex addict. What? No seriously! This and the new take on Barbara derail the source materials point beyond reason. A new mid-credit sequence is also highly problematic as it shifts away from the intriguing ideas of the final scene to again focus on Batgirl. Couldn't they just have revived the Batgirl Year One film instead? I can't believe that the film's dream team could make such mistake. Do I dislike the film after complain so much? Of course not! It's The Killing Joke come to life, new flaws and all. 8,5/10

Do yourself a favor and tune in @ minute 31, out of 76, and watch the Batgirl short thereafter, if ever. It may ruin the film's numerous qualities for you and that would be a shame. The Batman Year One film (9/10) showed how to extend short source material, while empowering the female lead, so don't ask me what happened here! 6,5/10",1469577600,6,4109,4.441059602649006

In the graphic novel, her character was nonimportant, so the first bit of the movie was created to establish her character more, and visualize her need to be ""recognized"" by the criminals more, to maoe her character more tragic in a scene later in the film.

That said, the movie stays true to the comic to the end. Its a dark story set against bright animation. By no means is it the worst of the DC animation (which they have on lock. Sorry Marvel), but better than Superman Doomsday and All Star Superman. My hope is that they treat the fans to limited theatrical releases like they did this one. It was worth the money.

7465614,4,B0169PXGUA,"Batman: The Killing Joke has always been a great Batman story and this adaptation is no different. If you're a fan of DC's animated films and shows, you'll likely find something to like in this. The returning cast is spectacular as always. Animation is for the most part excellent, though I found some poorly animated aspects to be jarring. For example, early on in the film's prologue it shows the exterior of a building. The cityscape and the building in focus looked excellent, but the windows looked like stickers pasted on the sides. The action was good, some blood and fights that really showed off the R-rating. There are also sexual themes present, but nothing graphic. Personally I had no issues with this plot point, but I can see how it presents issues. Not only can it seem creepy, but it also can be taken as downplaying Barbara and making her seem like less a strong heroine and more like just a woman pining after the strong male hero. As if this story didn't already struggle with properly treating the character. A smaller gripe I have would be Batman's cowl. It looked a bit like the original cowl with its curved ears.

In my screening (I saw it in theaters, so it may be different on Blu-Ray) the film was split into three segments. The first was a sort of documentary style interview with Mark Hamill and his journey of becoming the Joker and how the character has changed. This beginning part was very interesting to me and I wouldn't have minded it being far longer. From Batman the Animated Series to Arkham Asylum and now TKJ I enjoyed the format of the interview.

Next came a sort of prologue to TKJ. It had Batgirl trying to prove herself to Batman. This part wasn't quite as enthralling as the rest of the film, but it didn't seem to be completely pointless either. I've always been frustrated with the way Batman pushes his sidekicks out, and of course it isn't very different here. Despite Batman's orders against it, Batgirl continues working a case with a criminal that is obsessed with her. As the two butt heads over the case they become romantically involved, I guess? It is a short scene that pans away and the two don't talk to each other afterwards. It is a bit awkward and doesn't really feel like it needed to be in there, though I guess it shows how close the two are. Or at least that was probably the intent. This segment of the story ends with Batgirl coming close to the abyss, a theme introduced a bit earlier and foreshadowing the ending.

The final portion of the film is The Killing Joke itself. The story is fantastic and made me feel raw emotions over the way characters are treated. It is no small secret that TKJ cripples Batgirl. I hate the way this is handled, yet at the same time I suppose that shows it was handled perfectly. It seems so senseless to hurt Babs like this, but that is exactly what The Joker is. He is a senseless monster that will do anything to hurt you. Perhaps his best and worst feature. TKJ also shows one of Joker's origins, perhaps his best one, but The Joker himself mentions that he doesn't know the correct origin. We are taken along with Jim Gordon on the worst day of his life, but we see him make it through. Jim doesn't want Joker to win. The system has to, and it shows the strength of his character even with what The Joker has done to him. The ending is left ambiguous, which is perfect. I love how it ends. You don't completely know what just happened and are left with chilling laughter, but you might be surprised who is laughing.

Ultimately I enjoyed TKJ, but it is certainly not without its issues. These issues run all the way back to the original comic itself. I'm uncomfortable with how nonchalantly sidekicks are used against Batman. It has been done before and it surely will be done again, but it diminishes the sidekicks as a character. It makes them seem more like objects to Batman rather than actual fully fledged characters. Len Wein's horrible comments on Barbara certainly don't make it seem like she was an actual character. This story is a high point for The Joker, but it is also a low point for Barbara. This story breaks Barbara and she is still being pieced back together. I hope in the future we can avoid such nonchalant destruction of a character. Plus there is the cowl. It bothers me more than it should, but I really hate that thing.",1469577600,10,4356,4.496212121212121
7465615,5,B0169PXGUA,"Having seen The Killing Joke in theaters the very night of writing this review, I must say I am NOT disappointed.

The movie begins with Barbara Gordon narrating the story leading up to her retirement (or firing) as Batgirl and, as many will say, it gets kinda awkward. While I appreciate the attempt to create a bond between the viewer and Barbara, I can speak for the majority by saying it was very unsettling to see Batman and Batgirl in, putting it nicely, a romantic situation.  Batman is meant to be more of a father figure to Batgirl, and what we get is something much different; however, once the ball gets rolling in terms of the Joker's story line, the viewer is in for a treat.

Yes, this film is what you were asking for if you wanted to see the Joker in all of his maniacal glory...I couldn't help but get chills to see the graphic tale of the Joker I know and love on the big screen.  If you love the Joker as much as any Batman geek, you will come to love the fact that this is a service to the character and one of the most iconic voice actors to take on the role of our favorite clown prince of crime.  Some will say Hamill ""phoned in"" his performance, but I disagree.  This is the story he always dreamt of being involved in, and his performance is nothing short of spectacular.  Yes I may sound like a fanboy, but this is the pinnacle of the Joker's escapades and I feel Hamill treats it as such.

Kevin Conroy contributes his talent as the brooding Dark Knight....and I can't say it was anything less than expected.  While the laugh after Joker's joke at the end of the film may seem a little drawn out and slightly forced, it isn't anything I consider to be a dealbreaker for the rest of Conroy's performance. After all, how often do you hear Batman laugh? It should sound somewhat strange to hear a chuckle out of our hero, right??  I think he succeeds in creating the usual mood of Batman:...pissed off.

Overall, I felt that this movie did an extremely admirable job of bringing one of the most iconic Joker tales to life.  While the relationship between Batman and Batgirl is off, the story of the Joker and his point to prove what could happen to someone after one bad day is spot on to the source material of Alan Moore.  I think this movie should be respected as it could very well be one of the final performances we get out of Hamill as Mr J, and it serves as an accurate representation of a story into the mind of Batman's chuckling arch enemy...long live the Joker!",1469577600,7,2497,4.332618025751073

In my opinion it's really good I liked it allot.  Now slight spoilers ahead. The sex scene that everyone is freaking out about isn't that big of a deal it's being way overblown. It's about 10 seconds of kissing and taking a shirt off. Now I did think that batman and batgirl being involved like that was weird. I do prefer Batgirl and nightwing. But it's not a big deal.

7465632,4,B0169PXGUA,"When adapting a beloved story, there is always going to be fear the studio, the writers, or the directors will mess it up. It has happen innumerable times. So, it is all too natural to be wary. Especially when those involved openly admit they will be adding new material. All too often, that new material feels out of place. Not so here.

The story of the The Killing Joke is about The Joker. It weaves back and forth between present day and how The Joker came to be. That is all the comic is. The movie, however, opens up with Barbara Gordon, the original Batgirl, and Batman tracking down a stolen armored truck. The person leading the heist is Paris Franz, the nephew of a Gotham City mobster. Batgirl and Franz meet face to face, and it immediately begins a lust-filled plot by the latter to dominate her. He taunts her, pushing her beyond her limit. Batman, for his part, tries to keep her away, telling her not to go after him. After the final confrontation between Batgirl and Franz, where she nearlys kills him, she hangs up her cape.

The film then segues into a direct adaptation of the comic. Joker's first appearance, at the apartment of Comissioner Gordon, is chilling and effective. The musical number, while it feels upbeat, is equally chilling when you listen to the words.

All in all, this is a terrific adaptation, and worth seeing.",1469491200,3,1351,4.597510373443983

The Joker's backstory was weak and inconsequential, though that's a problem with the source, too.  I also wish that they had removed the scenes/dialogue with Batman trying to reason with the Joker.  I know some readers hold the comic book in high regard, but one of its creators has regretted various aspects of the story.

Kevin Conroy sounded as if he were on autopilot, though Mark Hamill and Tara Strong were very good.  Unfortunately, Bob Hastings passed away in 2014 and couldn't return as Commissioner Gordon.",1469491200,,663,4.883928571428571

Some creative choices made were questionable at best and just left me as a viewer feeling uncomfortable about the whole scenario. This is of course before the actual events of The Killing Joke take place (which I personally don't like but that's not what matters in this review). So when you put the prologue and The Killing Joke together, Batgirl just gets even more shafted as a character. The Killing Joke portion of the movie is very faithful to the source material, but the shift in perspective felt forced and is a little jarring. It felt like a two-parter episode that was cobbled together for theatrical release. The musical number that Mark Hamill performs as the Joker was catchy and well directed.

When the news broke that we were finally getting this film I was ecstatic, posting the news on every social media platform, pre-ordering the Blu-Ray, and when Warner Bros. decided to do a Fathom Events theatrical screening I bought up tickets for the first screening.  Last night I arrived at the theater, five of my coworkers, and as the feature started up my heart was a flutter.  My thirteen year old self was finally getting the film he wanted. I was ready to LOVE Batman: The Killing Joke...

That is why its with a heavy heart that I must report that DC Animations Batman: The Killing Joke may be the most disappointing movie of 2016.  A day later I am still roiling over the amateur mistakes in adaptation, unintentional comedy, and lackluster direction that transformed what should have been one of DC Animations stand-out films into their first train wreck.

The film opens with a storyline featuring Batgirl.  When I first heard about this, I thought, Good, because, one of the main faults in The Killing Joke, was how Barbara Gordon was reduced to a prop for Batmans story.  Giving her an expanded role was a good idea.  But, the story they choose to tell plays out as bad fan fiction.  All around me people were laughing in the aisles throughout this first act, and it wasn't intentional.  Worse: This does nothing to tie into The Killing Joke.  NOTHING! Its like two unrelated short films smashed together.

Then, mercifully, The Killing Joke begins.  As usual, Mark Hamill reminds viewers why hes the fanbase's definitive Joker.  Hearing him finally getting the chance to read these lines is certain to bring joy to all fans thatve grown up with his portrayal of the character.  Unfortunately, Hamills working against a production team that cant hit their mark.  Consistently visual decisions are made that undermine the cerebral nature of the comic, with animation that is sub-par compared to previous DC Animated films.  Scenes that were iconic in the graphic novel are undercut by uninspired direction (despite decades' worth of experience, Conroy and Hamill at times suffer from poor direction), and what appears to be the result of numerous budget cuts (why cut the rain out of the comic's famous final panels?).  In a word, its a mess.

Fans of Alan Moore and Brian Bolland's graphic novel and Batman: The Animated Series deserved better.  Suffice to say, Ive cancelled my pre-order of Batman: The Killing Joke on Blu-ray.  I never thought Id be saying this, but even the voices of Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy, and Tara Strong can't save this movie.  If you're a fan this is worth a rent if you want to hear Mark Hamills performance as the Joker, but we have to let Warner Bros. know that we deserve better from them.  It isn't enough just to say Weve made an R-rated Killing Joke movie with your favorite voice actors, they have to actually deliver on the legacy of said comic.",1469491200,43,3605,5.3250883392226145
7465637,5,B0169PXGUA,"I went and I saw the movie yesterday. Put simply, the opening act seemed a bit un-needed but it was not particularly un-canon. In the second part of Batman: The Killing Joke, The Killing Joke, it seemed pretty well done. I don't really understand why reviews seem to display it as A HUGE LET DOWN. I was rather pleased with it. Granted, the people I went home with were whining about how the ending was ""Anti-Climatic"", which was odd considering it left off on an fine note. Even if Batman's laugh started creeping me out a bit, actually kinda fitting considering he's not much of a laugh-er. It was, to me, a really enjoyable experience.

7465638,3,B0169PXGUA,"Saw this last night during the ""one night only"" release in theaters. I have to say that it was a major let down.

First off, while the artwork was fantastic, the actual animation was terrible in this. Very choppy. We've gotten so far in the animation department and this looked like something that was released in 1993, not 2016.

Secondly, the Batgirl Prologue was unnecessary and the transition into the killing joke was awful. I didn't even care about the scene that everyone has been moaning (including Batgirl...heyooo) has been moaning about, it just didn't add anything to the story in the long run. It didn't even bridge the connection Batman has to her like it wanted to. The intro with Mark Hammil was far, far better, and I would have rather seen 20-30 min of him and others involved talking about putting this on the screen over the Batgirl intro.

The movie itself was fine, it followed the comic, so there were no surprises, and there were no omissions. But why was this Rated R exactly? Justice League Flashpoint was PG-13, was far more violent, had an implied sex scene (Wonder Woman and Aquaman) and even had the insanely controversial Wonder Woman killing Billy Batson! The only thing that the Killing Joke had was the implied scene with Joker and Barbra, but even that wasn't R Rated worthy. Honestly, even Batman: Year One and The Dark Knight Returns were far more violent.

The only time I heard any gratuitous language at all last night was from the South Park preview and then my buddy and I yelling down to the guy in front of us to shut up when he wouldn't stop talking.

Overall the movie was true to the Killing Joke, but I think the hype train just ran off the rails with this one. It just doesn't live up to what you hope for.",1469491200,3,1755,4.523659305993691

I liked the animation and the faithful adaptation of the comic. Maybe the movie lacks in the obscure themes and it could be more dark like the other Batman's adaptations, but I liked the way it was adapted. Recommended if you are begenning with DCAU or with comics.

7465640,2,B0169PXGUA,"I watched the film last night at my local theater. This review contains light spoilers.

Batman: The Killing Joke (for those without background) was a graphic novel written in the 80s that primary deals with the Joker trying to prove that ""one bad day"" can make even the best people go crazy, because this is what he believes happened to himself. So he decides to try to prove his point by tormenting Commissioner Gordon: shooting his daughter (Barbara/Batgirl), kidnapping him, and torturing him. Batman naturally has to rescue the commissioner, and reflects on his own relationship with the Joker - are they destined to kill one another? Or are they more alike than they realize?

The movie adaptation does a fairly good job at depicting the graphic novel, although admittedly it isn't a very compelling or good story. The movie also adds a few extra plotlines to fill the time. We start with an introduction from Batgirl, where we establish that she and Batman are partners (Robin and/or Nightwing are nowhere to be found, although a picture we briefly see on Batman's computer indicates what may have become of Robin.) working to fight crime around Gotham City. However Batman calls the shots and is a bit controlling, and Barbara vents to her sassy gay friend at the library about ""this guy she's sort of seeing.""

I will disclaim by saying I have never cared for the Batgirl/Batman pairing. Anyone with actual knowledge of their character history would know that it is wildly out-of-character, and the only property that ever featured such a plotline was in the Batman: The Animated Series/Beyond universe. (Note Bruce Timm's involvement in both that series and this film.) It also really doesn't work here in the movie, since there's not enough time to develop it into anything meaningful to the plot, and just makes Barbara look like a lovestruck teenager who is pining after her ""yoga instructor."" It has no impact on the story, which already feels disjointed due to essentially being two short movies in one. I can only assume they added this in there to add more of an emotional connection between Batgirl and Batman, but that's very much a cop-out. The characters already are connected via being partners in crime-fighting, and obviously (if you look at the comic book history of the two characters) it's possible for them to care about each other without wanting to have sex, too.

The second half of the movie alternates between the present, where Joker has kidnapped Commissioner Gordon and is determined to drive him insane, and the past, where we see Joker's origin tale come to life. He maintains his position that ""one bad day"" is all it takes to drive someone off the edge. Batman comes to the commissioner's rescue, and has a moment with the Joker where he confronts him about what the end will be between them. The movie ends almost abruptly on a strange note, but I think it works well enough.

As an adaptation of The Killing Joke, you're probably not going to get any better. (I don't think The Killing Joke is a great story to begin with, though.) And the movie does nothing to improve the role that Batgirl had (in the original graphic novel, she was merely a plot device) since her part is essentially just a long prologue and another plot device to give Batman more motivation. The second part of the movie doesn't even need the first part at all to tell its story. It's a shame, since Batgirl rarely gets any screentime as it is, that they wasted this opportunity to develop her. I do hope that if this movie performs well, maybe we could get a movie adaptation of a better Batgirl story, such as ""Batgirl: Year One,"" somewhere down the line.

The artwork is pretty, the sound is good. I enjoyed the voice-acting (there was actually a 10 minute interview with Mark Hamill before the movie where he talked about his various roles). I didn't really think the movie deserved an R-rating, however. ""Under the Red Hood,"" which had a PG-13 rating, seemed more disturbing of the two movies, and the blood and violence level in the two is about the same. (The only noticable difference was maybe some headshots?) There is more sexual content in ""The Killing Joke,"" although it's mostly just discussed/alluded to and barely anything is shown on screen. Swearing is also fairly minimal, and no F-bombs. I was a bit worried when I saw a family come in with their little son, but honestly it wasn't that bad. I still wouldn't recommend it for kids, though.

Overall - worth a watch, but not a great film. Maybe wait for Netflix or borrow from a friend. It's definitely not one I'll be buying.",1469491200,8,4610,4.733499377334994

7465642,3,B0169PXGUA,"I saw this movie in its limited theater release last night at my local theater. It was only going to be shown for a couple nights before the DVD goes on sale. I'll try to limit the spoilers, but please be advised that if you want to stay completely spoiler free, then you may want to check out another review.

The movie is essentially divided into two parts. The first part attempts to develop the character of Barbara Gordon while the second part is based on the Killing Joke story by Alan Moore. I will say that the second part is VERY true to form and they do a great job with that story. It's like the comic has come to life and I give that part of the story 5 stars. It's exactly what I had hoped for and come to expect from DC animation.

That said, the first part of the story, is nothing short of an epic fail. In an attempt to develop the character of Barbara Gordon, the writers/animators develop someone who is NOTHING like the Barbara Gordon that long time fans, like myself, have come to know and love. Much of this revolves around a key scene where (LAST CHANCE - SPOILER) Batgirl and Batman share an...um...intimate moment (to state it nicely) which is something that I would expect more from Catwoman than from Barbara. It's completely out of character and adds very little to the story and goes against much of the established characterization. Later in the story, Batgirl is trying to talk with Batman about this shared moment and she says ""It was just sex!"", which again, makes the character of Batgirl seem a little slutty. Clearly this is not who that character is and again, something that would make more sense coming from Catwoman or Poison Ivy (had either of them been in the story). Plus there is the ""ick"" factor because Batman had always been more of a father figure and role model for Batgirl, not a lover.

As for the rest of the story, there is an up and coming mobster that gets into Batgirl's head, which makes the beginning interesting. The writers reach a little to make that story work, but its somewhat entertaining so I won't be overly critical of it. For long time fans like me, I went to see this for the ""second act"" and, like I said earlier, that did not disappoint.

This could rank higher for the more casual fan and I expect that for more of the die-hard fans, there could be some tougher criticisms. If you are long time DC Comic fan, consider this fair warning.

Kevin Conroy is great as Batman and of Mark Hamill is always amazing as The Joker and this might be his best version yet. I would give this segment of the movie a 9/10.

I went to the Cinema to see this last night, and have been considering what to write in this review, this is the adaptation I've been waiting for for years, and i'm not the only one. And yes, its very good, but there are a few personal critical things for me, that stop this from getting 5 stars, which I awarded my favourite graphic novel of all time, so yes despite the wait, the book is still better than the adaptation, which with Mark Hamill playing the Joker, I never thought id say. Now I have gone into this with a critical mind, but because I have been waiting and wanting this for so long I have gone in with the highest expectations and am not going to pull my punches when analysing. I still enjoyed it and I don't want to drown in the tears of other fan boys or BvS denial crazies so if you agree or disagree just remember this is my personal opinion and feel free to discuss or ask questions in the comments below, just don't be a Dick.... Grayson about it.

The animation. This frustrates me probably the most and was the biggest disappointment. How? Just how? How is it that the animation from the 90s animated series surpasses animation in 2016? The 90s animated series ran flawlessly, looked natural and fluent with characters and backdrops looking stunning in every scene. However in this modern day (And its not just the Killing Joke) several Batman animated films seems to run in clunky, unnatural manner with characters moving unnaturally in an almost stop motion type fashion. I don't understand? when compared to the animation used in the 90s and in other animated shows this just looks cheap, I was hugely disappointed as i though all stops would have been pulled out for such an iconic adaptation. Some scenes animated ok, such as the carnival fight scene but other times i was biting my lip in rage as I was watching Batgirl running with her arms pumping all over the place stop start stop start stop start. There was also a couple of uses of what I presume was CGI models for the backdrop of Gotham City during a car chase, which again seemed unnatural and out of place and actually took away from the impact of the environment they where speeding through as it just looked fake (Did we learn nothing from the Spider-Man animations).

The set up. Now before I even went in to the film I knew they would have to provide an initial Batgirl segment to build the character up for those who have never seen or understood the character. If they had just jumped in an adapted the book word for word with no extra scenes, new people watching wouldn't comprehend the gravity and ramifications of the Jokers actions later on in the story on a girl they had just met. So I was looking forward to watching a new build up in the esque of Moores Killing Joke. Yet the the first half an hour of Batgirl material, felt rather out of place, it tied nothing into the main Killing Joker story, there was no clever set up for what was to come, there was no discussions about ramifications or history with the Joker, it was just weird, really really weird. and then there's that scene... I cant spoil it, I really really want to talk about it but i'm not going too. There's a scene that... shall we say heavily complicates Batman and Batgirls relationship which just creeps me out to think about. It was a scene that was heavily out of character for Batman and seems to serve no purpose. Beyond weakening and objectifying Batgirl who immediately after takes on a new character of an insecure high school girl who over thinks, obsesses and the whole independent strong woman vibe goes out of the window. When you've seen the film or have any questions about this scene, believe me, you'll know it when you see it, then feel free to ask or discuss in the comments.

My final little niggles where the design of the characters, the mouths didn't move fluently with the dialogue, they seems somehow less detailed than I had hoped and looked very little like the comic versions from which they where adapted (Apart from a couple of scenes that where directly assimilated from page to screen which i'll touch on later). The eyes in some scenes looked rather unnatural as pupils constantly changed shape and position, becoming goat like in a couple of scenes as pupils stretched out horizontally, which when characters are bought to life this way it removes you from being submersed in the film as you are constantly reminded ITS A PUPPET! (Its not real).
The final thing was there was one scene that didn't appear in the movie that I was quite looking forward too, whether it was a deleted scene or what I don't yet know. In the book the Joker makes a creepy quip about how does the normal man fare in today's society, which I enjoyed in the book as it gives us a bit more insight into how the Joker views everybody else shuffling about on the planet, and yet it was missing from this film.

Now I don't want you to go away worrying or doubting the quality of the film, because I did enjoy it and it is still a four star product in my opinion so i'll briefly touch on the positives this film offered.
Firstly and probably the most obvious positive was... the voice acting. Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Tara Strong POW! what else do you need? Mark Hamill has been pushing for this adaptation for years! since the 90s in fact and finally despite being extremely busy with the new Star Wars film (Hes Luke Skywalker for those rare few who don't know) he still made time to come in a voice this iconic character in this iconic adaptation. And boy it doesn't disappoint, although his Joker is slightly let down by the animation his performance is 5 stars as always, along with Kevin Conroy who is THE voice of Batman.
There were a few iconic scenes adapted from the comic to the film that stood out from the rest of the film, the scene when Batman visits the Joker in Arkham, the end of the coffee table scene and the Red Hoods transformation, these scenes looked almost exactly as they did in the graphic novel; stunning and wow it just sends shivers down your spine to see such beauty and watch moments jump off the page directly onto the screen. This was all done artistically to heighten the impact of these scenes, yet again sorry to drag back into the negatives also serves a reminder as to how much better the animation could have been throughout the ENTIRE film instead of just at a handful of iconic moments. None the less these scenes are stunning.
And of course, the story itself. The Killing Joke, its all there, apart from that one little tidbit I mentioned earlier, it doesn't cut out the gory or the disturbing parts, it doesn't alter or belittle the graphic novel story (Batman: Under the Red Hood) it does change a few environments and beefs up a few of the ""extras"" characters involvement but its all there and its all recognisable. As soon as the Batgirl segments finished readers of the Graphic novel will immediately recognise where they are where they are going and this just adds to excitement, like riding a roller coaster, you can see where your going but the drops still make your stomach turn.

Overall I highly recommend this film, its a piece of Batman history and considering the entire cinema was full yesterday (And I mean there wasn't a single seat left) just goes to show how many people have been waiting to see this and couldn't wait until the release of the DVD/Blu-ray. This said I would still probably have to recommend the Graphic Novel more than the film, but get both and decide for yourself which one you prefer.
Again feel free to ask questions in the comments, i'm always interested to bounce ideas and hear opinions different or even in direct conflict with my own, just keep it clean and polite. But just to warn you the comments I may receive below might contain spoilers.",1469491200,21,7827,4.516925246826516
7465645,4,B0169PXGUA,"""Just watched this movie about 1 hour ago""
Dear fellow DC enthusiasts,

As much of y'all already know, the controversial topic being discussed is the sex scene involving Batgirl and Batman. While many people feel that it is unnecessary and very wrong to even ""go there"" between the two characters, I personally don't care. If you are someone who wants a strict dead-on adaptation, well this isn't for you. But honestly good luck finding those, because it seems that almost all of the new DC movie adaptations aren't going to be dead-shot *cough* I mean -on representations of their comic book origins.

So let's just skip the whole ""not true to the comic"" line and move on to the next subject.

Now here is where I think the audience will divide on this movie- should this movie have included the sex scene and/or even included Batgirl having feelings for Batman? I believe audiences will fall under one of three camps.

A. No because he is like a father figure to her and they are around 15-20 years apart.
B. Well they had a relationship in Batman: The Animated Series and further evidence shown in Batman Beyond...
C. I personally don't care

Regardless of the ""not being true to the comic"" statement, in my opinion it seems that people are taking the ""father-figure"" relationship too seriously. Being someone who doesn't read the comics and only watches the adaptations/animated series, I may be missing the evidence suggesting why realistically these two characters wouldn't have a ""thing"" happen. Isn't kind of strange how almost every female character is attracted to Batman/Bruce Wayne in some sort of fashion? Why should Barbara be any different?

Yes yes I acknowledge my ignorance in the Batman/Batgirl comic book realm, but solely looking through the lenses of someone who only watches the adaptations/animated series, is it really that bad?",1469404800,2,1853,4.942122186495177
7465646,2,B0169PXGUA,"Never read the comic, but this movie was nothing special. The ""controversial"" scene wasn't even a big deal and the R rating is overkill. They pointlessly animated an extra 25 minutes for nothing, just so they could feel good about themselves and please the SJW loons. That cash used to make the extra content would of been better served making the animation better. DC animation isn't bad, but it looks very flat, basic and boring . Would of been awesome just to of made a shorter film and really showcase some great animation . Instead it's just, meh.......next film should be outsourced to madhouse .",1469404800,,602,4.742857142857143
7465647,4,B0169PXGUA,"Alright just got back seeing The Killing Joke and here's what I think. The movie opens with a beautiful skyline shot of Gotham City and then we hear Barbra Gordon's voice:

""I bet you're surprised to hear my voice start this tale. And I bet you're even more surprised to know that this is actually my story.""

That's when I knew the first thirty minutes was going to be pointless. Because this isn't Barbara Gordon's story. It's The Joker and Batman's. This new opening isn't bad within itself. It's actually pretty cool, but it has nothing to do with the rest of the story. My brother said it best and called it an okay episode from the Batman Animated series. It's more of a love story between Batman and Batgirl and that's fine, but here it just doesn't work. Because after the first act is over they never mention anymore on this at all. So to be perfectly clear it wasn't needed.

What they could've done if they wanted to give the film a longer running was pad out the Joker's backstory. Show more the relationship between him and his wife. I don't know why they felt like adding a new backstory to Batgirl here. It doesn't work at all and for once I can understand the fan backlash.

Anyway...

When the Killing Joke starts the movie is a very faithful adaptation of the comic. It's great in every way. The Joker has never been darker and Mark Hamill delivers his best perforce as the character. It was also nice to have Kevin Conroy back as the Dark Knight. I really wish he would've done the voice for the character in The Dark Knight Returns.

So all in all I recommend this adaptation, but when it's released on bluray/dvd just skip to the part where the Killing Joke starts. That's where the real movie is.

7465662,2,B0169PXGUA,"This is actually two movies. The second half is ""The Killing Joke."" The first half is ""Adventures with Batgirl."" I actually enjoyed the first half a lot. It was an original story and reminded me a lot of the good old days with Batman: The Animated Series. I was enjoying it...until it got to the part that completely destroys Barbara Gordon's character. She goes from being an extremely intelligent character (one of the most intelligent characters in the DCU) and they turn her into a horny teenage emo girl. She tackles Batman, kisses him, he grabs her butt, she rips her shirt off and we get to see her in her bra. This is coupled with scenes later on in the movie where she is shot and sexually assaulted. I mean...COME ON!!! Batgirl is ruined in this movie. RUINED!

The second half of the movie is when ""The Killing Joke"" actually starts. It has no relation AT ALL to the first half of the movie. Barbara getting shot isn't anymore meaningful because of the tacked on prologue. The first half of the movie didn't need to happen AT ALL. But, as for ""The Killing Joke"" itself, I was bored. The biggest problem I had with it is that it was so poorly animated. The graphic novel is stunning to look at. The visuals bring you into this world and you're shocked and horrified at what you're looking at. Here, the animation is very cheap looking and they totally fail at capturing the right tone. I just kept thinking to myself that I would rather be reading the graphic novel than watching this.

A recently escaped Joker targets Batman, Commissioner Gordon, and his daughter, Batgirl, in a depraved mission to prove a point: Were all just one bad day away from going mad.

What did I think?

True to the comics as if it was ripped from the pages itself, scenes play out more as art than straight feature. Each scene leaves you more uneasy than the last as the Joker raises the stakes of depravity with each passing second (including an incredibly upsetting song and dance number). Its high drama, confronting themes and squeamish moments, married with an atmospheric score and amazing performances from Batman alumni Mark Hamill, Kevin Conroy, and Tara Strong.

7465668,4,B0169PXGUA,"One thing to keep in mind is that TKJ was never meant to be canon; it was an alternate story.  It simply steamrolled past its original purpose and became one of the most compelling & galvanizing events in comics history, even more so now with having garnered so much mileage out of it DC made the utterly ridiculous decision to retcon the whole thing, which only cements the movies role as a cash cow than the next step in cinematic continuity.

The R-rating is both well earned and deserved.  In both stories we get graphic violence  dismemberments, gunshots, bodies, etc- and while not so much nudity some very direct handling of mature and sexual themes.  Notable is the fetishization of Batgirl by the villain in the first story- down to having a call girl wearing a bat mask- and that one scene everyones talking about.

Whats Bad: The disconnect the first part has with the rest of the movie.  Its a completely separate story and youd think it would tied into the bigger story but ultimately has no bearing on anything, other than perhaps to build the emotional connection to Barbara.  Theres literally nothing to tie the two together other than the characters, and it makes you wonder why they bothered.

As a nitpick there was one part of the Joker's speech about madness to Batman that I noticed was left out: about how a key factor to the start of World War I was how many telegraph poles Germany owed their creditors.  No idea why that one didn't make the cut.

Whats Good:  I did like the first story about Batgirls relationship with Batman.  Is it hero worship or something more?  As Barbara Gordon, she voices her frustrations to a co-worker, who naturally doesnt quite understand the dynamics of this thing she has or doesnt have with her yoga instructor.  (She likes the yoga).

Hes demanding; hes always been demanding- and controlling!  But I cant just find another class!  There isn't one; this is it!  And Im good!  He won't say it, but Im the best damn student hes ever had!  So if hes gonna start making decisions based on emotions- of which he has ZERO- then I think weve got a problem!  Ok, then.

It works well as a standalone.  Its actually pretty good; it completely drew me in before it fizzled out. The story opens with Batgirl assisting Batman on what seems like a simple getaway after a robbery, but the thieves are more resourceful that expected, giving Batgirl the slip.  But the embarrassment of the incident leads crime boss Francesco to order his nephew Paris Franz, to reimburse him for his losses or else.  Paris already has his eye on his uncles businesses and, in true psycho-sociopathic fashion, happens to have a thing for Batgirl.  Bats doesn't want her involved; Paris' attraction to her makes it even more dangerous and  can lead you right to the edge of the abyss.  And it's not a view you want to take in.

A lucky break leads Batgirl right to Paris, but he gets away again.  Batman, recognizing what Paris is all about, orders her not to take him on without him there, which gets her back up.  Paris lays a trail for her to follow- right to his uncles body.  This leads us to *that scene*.

Now I wholly understand the outrage, I do.  Aside from the squick factor both the buildup and the scene itself was awkward and felt literally just inserted in (pun intended).  But I think the outrage has more to do with Batgirl's reaction in the aftermath than the sex itself.

If there was somewhere to go with this, if it had built towards something, I think it would've all worked out fine.  But it didn't.  After the case is wrapped up, their big talk is Barbara informing Batman she's retiring as Batgirl and... that's it.  The only acknowledgement of what happened between them is that they're too close now and it's time for her to step back from the abyss.  So I guess she got her wish after all.

When we finally get to the Killing Joke itself, it's a faithful adaptation of the comic.  Its stellar in that regard, but not without a few flaws.  Like all adaptations, familiarity with the material is both helpful and harmful.  It helps because it takes a few shortcuts with dialogue; some things couldve been expanded and fleshed out a little without missing a beat.  But writer Brian Azzarello mustve figured the fans already knew, so just stuck to the story panels, making for some choppy exposition; without captions to expound on the situation we have to rely on the script, and the script needed some beefing up.

The animation is also great: the visual style is directly drawn from Brian Bollands artwork, right down to Batmans ears on his cowl.  The mix of CGI into the animations is pretty flawless, even when obvious in some scenes.  All the iconic visuals are present: the Jokers appearance at Barbaras apartment (his eyes!), Batmans visit to Arkham, Jim Gordons ghost ride through the tunnel- all there, as well as the flashbacks of the Jokers past leading up to that fateful night at the chemical plant.  Theres also a few new wrinkles: the Joker performs a musical number while Gordon rides through the tunnel and sees the up close photos of his daughter, Batmans search for his prey who oddly hasn't returned to his usual haunts.

And I'd be remiss without mentioning the outstanding work of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy reprising their roles.  Felt like old times.

The finale remains ambiguous, as it should.  The idea of Batman strangling Joker to finally put an end to their conflict is left to the imagination, and since its an alternate storyline, whatever ending suits you is fine.

Whats Left: overall an odd offering from DC.  The first part, while entertaining, is rendered pretty meaningless other than for shock value and, according to the internet, they got it in spades.  You really can skip right past it and go straight to the main event, which won't disappoint in the slightest.  In fact, itll put a smile on that face.  Batman: The Killing Joke kills it.

7465669,1,B0169PXGUA,The art was very boring and surprisingly  the story and voice acting is vary rush and poor and I was most confident that the voice acting will save it but no it's heartbreaking as a fan to watch this amazing story get s***ed on the big screen :/,1469232000,9,245,4.104166666666667
7465670,3,B0169PXGUA,"I want to start off by saying the three star rating is for the quality of the adaptation from graphic novel to animation. Batman: The Killing Joke is considered one of the best--if not, the best--Joker stories of all time. Adapting it to animation or live-action has been a nightmare for its fans and the R-rating pretty much sums why it has been problematic. While I enjoyed the graphic novel, I was not very impressed with the adaptation especially the added segments on Batgirl's arc. Overall, I liked the faithful adaptation of the movie but some parts did not click like the aforementioned Batgirl storyline, the Joker's musical number, Batman & Batgirl's romantic fling, etc. These setbacks, however, are outweighed by Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill's performances as Batman and the Joker, respectively. The strength of The Killing Joke is not the plot but the themes--sanity and madness--the novel and its adaptation attempt to explore.

I highly recommend first-time viewers to read the graphic novel first if they haven't before watching the adaptation. The ideas presented may not make sense at first and will just confuse you. One thing is for sure: it's great to have Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill back together again.",1469232000,15,1227,5.014705882352941
7465681,3,B0169PXGUA,"I'm very close to giving this 4 stars, but I just can't because I came away not wanting to watch it again. It's definitely not up to par with Mask of the Phantasm or Under the Red Hood. It's not even as good as Subzero or The Dark Knight Returns.

However, The Killing Joke is a faithful adaptation of the comic book if you ignore the extra bit of story at the beginning, which honestly was not bad. It sets up the relationship between Barbara and Bruce as they hunt down Paris Franz. So I have no complaints there. This is a highly regarded classic story of the Batman/Joker relationship.

But even as Alan Moore, the guy who wrote the story says, ""I don't think it's a very good book. It's not saying anything very interesting."" And he's right. The Killing Joke has nothing really to say. And that's part of the problem when you do a faithful adaptation of a story with nothing interesting to say. Your story doesn't have anything interesting. No characters in the story have an arc. They just are. If the movie makers had done something to give Barbara, Bruce, or even Joker an arc, we might have had a 4 or 5 star story on our hands. But no effort was made.

The artwork in this is shoddy. It feels rushed. There is little detail. The directing isn't great either. Many scenes feel choppy. And the voice work isn't great either. Tara Strong stands out as the best of the bunch here, but Maury Sterling also brings life to Paris Franz. It shocked me that Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill really didn't shine in their roles. I think they may be getting too old to pull off the vocal range. Either that or they kind of checked it in. Hamill is now 64. Conroy is 60. I just didn't think either one brought much emotion or power to any particular moment. However, this may go back to the script. Batman comes across as very one-note.

As someone who was excited to see this adaptation, I came away disappointed. WB animation has got to focus more on fleshing out characters. I can forgive the tepid animation and artwork, but audiences need characters who grow and change. Nothing really happened in the movie. It just felt like a long episode of Batman: The Animated Series, but not even a memorable one.",1469232000,5,2200,4.424691358024691

7465683,4,B0169PXGUA,"Spoiler free

I must admit I had high expectations going in. Perhaps that is why I was disappointed to say the least. Without spoilers I'll break down the film and what did and didn't work.

The opening first act is a new story showing Batgirl and Batman together in action. Kevin Conroy (Batman) is usually always a treat and although his character is dark and brooding, I never felt any connection between himself and Barbara. Some might point out that is the point. However Conroys performance,for the most part, felt phoned in.
The opener was meant to establish Batgirl and make us care about her encounter later on with The Joker. While not the best addition to the film I can see why it was done. To make the viewer care about Babs, as well as create a run time.
The actual ""Killing Joke"" part of the movie is give or take 40 minutes.

As always Hamill (Joker) knocked it out the park but at times I found myself questioning his choice in reading certain lines the way he does. Hamill will always be ""The Joker"", but this was not his best performance.

I often felt at times (ecspecially Conroys awful laugh at the end) the lines weren't being delivered the way Moore wrote them down on paper. This film was a true awakening that not every comic book can be adapted into another medium and be successful.

I know I have spoken about a ton of negatives but this film is enjoyable. It doesn't overstay it's welcome and it was cool to finally see ""The Killing Joke"" on screen. I just think personally this is an example where the source material could not be duplicated and expect the same results. Even the ""R"" rating felt undeserved as I felt (a much better film) Dark Knight Returns was much more graphic and violent. You will notice early on, ecspecially during Batgirls story, a lot of sex and drugs are included seemingly for the fact to make this film ""edgy""

While enjoyable, it certainly has its flaws and thus the WEAKEST of four stars. More then likely you will sit down watch this and enjoy it. Heck some may even love it. Everyone has a different opinion but in my case this way a comic being adapted that didn't hold the same gusto and awe as the medium it is based off of.",1469145600,20,2190,4.435323383084577

I've been a Batman fan since I was 6 years old. My Dad took me to the comic book store on my birthday and bought me Detective Comics #571. I was fascinated seeing Batman and Robin swoop down on the Scarecrow on the cover. The story? Scarecrow was using his fear gas on sports stars to influence gambling. Sounds familiar right?

Nearly 10 years later Bruce Timm and Kevin Conroy took my budding interest into a full blown addiction as that very first issue was an episode of Batman: The Animated series. I was hooked. I wanted all the books, all the movies, all the action figures. I wanted all the Batman.

At some point I got Alan Moore's The Killing Joke. One summer week I was grounded because I may or may not have tried to help my dad with cleaning his truck by putting what I thought was washer fluid into his reservoir. It was coolant. So while being stuck in my well lit Batcave I delved into the horrific story Moore penned and Brian Bolland drew beautifully.

I was horrified and thrilled at the story. The Batman I knew and loved had never been in such a story so dark. I cringed at seeing Jim Gordon's butt and weeped at Barbara being shot and found dark humor at Joker's antics.

The Killing Joke is the single Batman story that I can go back to again and again and still be sucked in as if reading it for the first time.

I simply can not wait for this movie to come out.

UPDATE 8.28.16

Now that I've had time to watch the movie and formulate an opinion, this is getting reduced to 1 star.

7465760,5,B0169PXGUA,Growing up as a DC fan I always found The Joker one of the most interesting character villains in Batman's world. The Killing Joke will be the comic that everyone will remember in history with its crazy story and genius work from Alan Moore After almost 30 years The Killing Joke will be made into a full length Animated feature by Bruce Timm and the legendary voice actors Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill will be back once again (Batman Animated Series) (Batman Arkham) who will voice Batman and Joker. I am so excited for the movie to come out we should be getting a trailer later this year in San Diego Comic Con so most likely it will be released in DVD and Blu-ray sometime before fall. I will give this still 5 stars cause the people in DC always make Amazing Animated movies and I'm positive The Killing Joke will be by far the best one since The Dark Knight Returns. If you are a Batman fan or even a Joker fan this is a must have to read and watch.,1459382400,39,954,4.247252747252747
8736022,1,B0169PXGUA,"Horrible. Watching this almost ruins the graphic novel. The actual adaptation was nothing special - animation just average, voice acting surprisingly below average! ( I love Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill as Batman/Joker, but this was faaar from their best performances). Worst of all is the unnecessary added Batgirl prologue. Not only is Barbara Gordon now a victim of a stalker, but now she lusts for Batman. I know this is wierd subplot created by Bruce Timm/Paul Dini, but BATMAN WOULD NOT HAVE SEX WITH HIS SON'S GIRLFRIEND! There is a reason this was never explored in the source materials (comics) - it's because it makes an honorable hero into a complete scumbag. Yes, it can be augured that both Batman and Batgirl were adults and that Dick and Barbara weren't dating at that particular time, but it was still so creepy and out of character for all parties involved that it literally ruined the story for me. I struggle to remember the original graphic novel and forget this sick trash, and I would strongly suggest reading the source and skipping this crappy movie!",1534377600,,1074,4.842391304347826
