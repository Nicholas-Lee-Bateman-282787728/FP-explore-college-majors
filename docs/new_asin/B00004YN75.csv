Amazon.co.uk Review
Regularly touted as one of the best British sitcoms ever, Only Fools and Horses kicked off in 1981 when mobile phones were the size of bricks and wine bars were the ultimate places to hang out in. The formula was simple enough: Cockney wideboy Derek Trotter (brilliantly played by David Jason) dreams of better things for himself while sharing a cramped council flat in the nicely named Peckham tower block Nelson Mandela House with his unworldly brother Rodney and his sweet but doddery old granddad.

Trouble is, Del's endless money-making schemes (such as his attempt to flog a consignment of one-legged turkeys, or his plan to sell bottled tap water) inevitably backfire, like the knackered old Robin Reliant van he uses to cart around all this faulty gear. Created by John Sullivan, who also sings the very catchy theme tune, Only Fools and Horses is a wonderful mix of dodgy but loveable characters (such as Del Boy's dimwit friend Trigger), knockabout slapstick (no-one falls down with as much comedic grace as Jason) and brilliantly crafted dialogue.

Sadly, Leonard Pierce who played Granddad died in 1983; but his armchair in the Trotter household was filled in 1985 by Buster Merryfield as Uncle Albert (an old merchant seaman who bores Del and Rodney with tales of his war days). The show ran to seven series and ended with characteristic warmth in 1991, when Del Boy became a father; but the Trotters made occasional returns to the small screens with six hugely popular one-off Christmas specials. As Del Boy himself might say: ""Lovely jubbly"". --Edward Lawrenson
