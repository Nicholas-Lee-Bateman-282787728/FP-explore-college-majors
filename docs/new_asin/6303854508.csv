720222,5,6303854508,"Ah, the Cold War. As we stare wistfully back at that half-century of empty threats and balks from the Soviet Union that let our nation prosper so, employing so many Americans, singlehandedly defeating the looming specter  of poverty through the massive peacetime military buildup that was our  citizens' collective meal ticket, we can't help but worry about how we'll  fare economically now that we've been forced into autonomy from the federal  government...And so begins ""Canadian Bacon"", Michael Moore's 1994  fictitous laff riot. It's an amazingly astute and hilarious look at how  beneficial cold wars really are to a country; and Moore doesn't let up in  his continuing crusade against the downsizing enigma, setting the movie in  Niagra Falls, New York, a city ravaged by unemployment, suicides, and  crime, due to the closing of (you guessed it) a cold war arms plant. The  American characters, John Candy in paticuliar, are all perfect, and the  Candian mounties had me rolling on the floor. Michael Moore's first foray  into fiction is utterly flawless.",926899200,13,1063,5.188235294117647

I'm not sure who he is lambasting more, us or them, but the results are hilarious. Having lived in the  ""Great White North"" for ten years growing up, I found Moore's  satire particularly poignant.

This movie didn't really materialize as a great comedy even though there were excellent actors and actresses.

Dialogue wasn't as good as prior Candy movies and I was throughly disappointed.

My wife couldn't watch it to the end. I personally think it was an embarrassment to both John Candys and Alan Aldas careers. A ""sad"" last movie release for Candy. The comedy King.

The one redeeming scene was with Dan Akroid. He isn't credited but was great as the Canadian officer.

If you want to see a Canadian comedy perhaps you might like to see Strange Brew starring Bob and Doug Mckenzie.

BTW My wife doesn't like that either.",1447718400,,706,4.653225806451613

I don't understand how you can ask this when I tried everything with you and MovieMars to get a return label because your ad for Canadian Bacon mentioned dvd but not Region 2 until the end of the ad,and that was after an ad for something else like StarWars. Then below that it mentioned region 2- I never got that far because everything above in the ad was exactly what I wanted to order.  Nothing was written by the letters ""dvd"" - about it being Region 2.
Then after going thru so much with MovieMars and you (Amazon) even on a chat with one of your people, and getting the refund for the dvd, you both sent me an email asking me if I was happy with my purchase.
Amazon, you know everything I've ever inquired about and bought, still you did not warn me about Region 2.  I have never bought Region 2.

720661,2,6303854508,"Canadian Bacon, 1995 film

The story begins with a view of Niagara Falls. A Presidential motorcade visits Buffalo NY. A man wraps duct tape around himself. A defense plant was shut down, jobs were lost forever. An old car drives to the Niagara River. Do the unemployed jump into the river? ""I'm kidding."" Surplus arms are auctioned off from the Hacker Industry plant. One man buys a rocket. The President arrives. Owner R. J. Hacker complains about a lack of war. Can a war increase the popularity of the President and provide more jobs? Did winning the Cold War have unforseen results? Sheriff Bud Boomer wants to buy M-16s for civilian use. The assassination attempt boosted his poll ratings! The President of Russia arrives for a summit meeting, he has no interest in raising tensions. ""Good Luck!""

What can they do for an enemy? Invaders from space? Killer bees? Canadians? We see a hockey game, where a complaint about beer starts a brawl. Americans are arrested and jailed! Will this mean war? The man at the Canada desk offers advice on this threat from the north. Do Americans believe whatever they are told? [Yes, like most other countries.] They got rid of the ""Miss Canada"" contest! Network News warns Americans about this threat. [Wow! I didn't know that.] People guard a bowling lane and pick up free rifles! There is a scheme to provoke a war: self-defense. An attack on the USA by Canadians will do it. But Sheriff Boomer captures them all! What can the Hacker Hellstorm do? A small group of Americans crosses the river. They dump litter in a park! [A gross insult?] The US President asks Canada to release the American hostage. ""God Bless America!"" Is this an act of war? They invade a hydroelectric facility in Canada and find the night shift.

A switch is turned and all of Canada goes dark. ""Welcome to Canada."" The Mountie displays his prisoners. ""Want some water?"" ""Too bad."" But Boomer's actions must be stopped by the Omega Force. Their truck is stopped on the highway, they must obey the language laws! They sing and talk about movie culture. ""The black guy always dies first."" The President learns about DEFCON 4! ""Toronto is like Albany, only cleaner."" Hacker complains and explains his actions to the President. His aide grabs the papers with the codes, but is arrested. Back in the tower Honey takes action against that infernal machine. ""You won"" says the President. The sword is mightier than the pen. Honey and Boomer taka a motorboat across the river. Will anything go wrong on the mighty Niagara?

This comedy-satire was written, produced, and directed by Michael Moore. No one else is to blame. Moore should stick to his documentaries and leave comedy to those with talent. Comedy is rarer than drama, or do people prefer drama? This must have been a big failure. ""The Mouse That Roared"" is a classic if dated comedy. You need writers with experience in comedy, who could have produced a better movie. Could a story about an invasion of Canada ever be a comedy?

In history the USA invaded Canada to liberate it in the War of 1775. Canada remained loyal to the Crown. In the War of 1812 Americans captured York, the capital, and burned it. The British burned Washington in retaliation. Since then relations with our Northern Neighbor have been as friendly as they should be.",1333324800,3,3309,4.7578397212543555

720664,5,6303854508,"Canadian Bacon is hysterical. A classic that's been buried for far too long. With a cast like Alan Alda (M.A.S.H.), Rip Torn, Rhea Perlman (Cheers), John Candy, Kevin Pollak and even a spot with Dan Aykroyd, the film is packed with talent.

Perhaps like other reviewers noted, those who live closer to the Canadian border may find the humor funnier. Living 99 miles from the Canadian border myself, I find the movie extremely entertaining. Light hearted and filled with humor, I can watch the movie again and again.

The main idea of the movie, a pretend war with Canada, is even humorous. When the U.S. president is unable to mix things up with Russia to try and boost their poll numbers with the public, they turn to Canada whom they portray as the most passive nation in the world. No matter how hard the American's try and provoke them, the only time they get any kind of a response is when they insult Canadian beer.

A rogue group of American's believing the war to be real decides to invade Canada on their own and cause some trouble. When they get caught and try to escape, they leave one of their team behind. Now it has become a rescue mission to get back into Canada and retrieve their missing member, and in the process they manage to inadvertently prevent a very real nuclear war.

Filled with one liners that keep you constantly chuckling, Canadian Bacon is a hidden gem of classic movies. Definitely worth picking up to add to a movie library.",1315958400,,1458,4.574712643678161
720665,3,6303854508,"""The Mouse that Roared"" meets ""Failsafe"" meets ""How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb."" The first and last sections of this movie are an uneven mix of the warmongering themes of those classics. However, whereas those movies were at least occasionally subtle in revealing the fatuous, unintended ways in which nations end up blowing themselves to smithereens - this movie remains a broadside against the specifically American way of contriving conflict.

It was produced and directed by Michael Moore and is the lighter side of his documentary preoccupations with the greed of capitalists and the moral malaise of government officials. You won't find an industrialist here who isn't nefarious, or an elected official who isn't willing to ""smile and smile and be a villain."" But this movie presents such inevitabilities all in cartoonish good fun.

Moore does tellingly call to mind some of the likely manipulations behind The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and the consequent escalation of the Viet Nam War in the 1960's. The characters in this farce use that supposedly contrived provocation as a template for their own attempts to provoke war with Canada when they want to boost their President's popularity ratings. This leads to a few cleverly barbed scenes.

For example, we see the President's advisors making good on their assertion that the American people can be manipulated into hating anyone the government picks as targets - including the Canadians. They crank up the propaganda machine against our neighbors to the North. A newscaster warns in tones heavy with sinister implication that the evil that is Canada is ""oozing like maple syrup"" down into our Country. Behind him there's a map of the Canadian/U.S. border showing a horrid, viscous brown liquid staining over our American territory.

This is good stuff. But there isn't enough such clear comedy in the early and late parts of this film. Too many ingredients get added to this pot of a plot. There are missile silos atop the Toronto Tower and a lot of other muddling mayhem.

The most consistently funny part of this film is its mid-section which concentrates on lampooning Canadians' stereotypical niceness. Our government has its work cut out for it trying to bestir Canadians to attack us. When John Candy's character commandeers a truck, spray paints it with anti-Canuck graffiti, and rides through the Canadian landscape - the only reaction he gets is a polite reminder from an Ontario highway patrolman that, by law, all signage in Canada must be bilingual - in English and French. So Candy has to go back and find room on the truck's panels for crude translations such as ""Mange moi underpants!"" This really had me LOL.

However, even this mid-section is a little uneven in its humor. Stephen Wright is a brilliant stand-up comedian, but he's miscast here as a Canadian Mountie whose part is written in to illustrate Canadians' over-the-top ma-and-pa white bread geniality. This is as askew as it would have been to cast Jackie Mason in the role of an Iowa corn farmer.

There are no extras on this DVD. That's too bad. A Director's Commentary would have been a good place for Michael Moore to air grievances against all the wrong-headedness and corruption in high places.

The film, released in 1995, is also very dated now in the wake of 9-11. Early on, the movie's Presidential advisors are shown ruling out the possibility of rallying public sentiment against Middle Eastern terrorists because terrorist assaults so far have been too fragmentary and unimportant. They figure their better chance is to rally feeling against the big, brooding country of Canada, the enemy on our doorstep.

So while ""Canadian Bacon"" had a good premise, filled with a lot of savory suggestions of comedic insight, I don't think it was quite well-cooked enough. It ultimately comes off as the clownish, ""A little smile, a little dance, a little seltzer down your pants."" The times might be ripe for a re-make.",1311465600,2,3976,4.993957703927492

The manufacturing of a bogus war with our Northern neighbors to drum up support for a faltering president is on the surface funny but it played out much better two years later in ""Wag the Dog"".  Director-writer-whatever Michael Moore undermines his premise by introducing a Strangelovian aspect which is totally superfluous.  Moore succeeds in lampooning Canadian culture but even there he was done one better a few years later by the ""South Park"" boys.  Terrance and Philip, anyone?  I did love an unbilled cameo by Dan Aykroyd as a Canadian policeman who makes the Anti-Canadian rebels correct the slogans spray painted on their panel truck with the French equivalent.  I guess the best reason to see ""Canadian Bacon"" is for the performance of John Candy who seems to be more engaged and less tired than we was in his final filmed role, ""Wagons East"".

This movie just could not hold my attention (or theirs, for that matter) nor was it anywhere close to have us laughing in stitches. I don't care if it was meant to be Michael Moore's way of being perpetually condescending and opposed to conservatives or if this movie had been done by a conservative. It just flat out wasn't worth the money to rent it for wasting our time to watch it.

If someone described to you the scenarios and jokes of Canadian Bacon you would probably think the film is a work of comic genius, for a lot of the gags are quite clever; unfortunately, however, Michael Moore's lone foray into non-documentary filmmaking reveals a lack of understanding about what makes for good comedy and satire, so the film regrettably remains clever on the page but fairly lackluster on screen.

I turned 19 in Ontario (their legal drinking age) so I had my share of Canadian beer and I have to say that I still like American beer better.  Oh, and by the way, my Mom and I were extras in this movie (in the scene where Alan Alda goes to Hacker for a speach).  The casting person asked if we could play American rednecks.  We looked at each other and laughed.  She didn't know that we were American until after she asked that question.  I think she was a little embarrassed once she figured it out since she asked the question in a rather demeaning way.

It doesn't get five stars, because it's a little rough, but it's an excellent sleeper comedy that deserved a much longer theatrical run than it did.  It's quirky, bizarre, and very funny.
However, there are a lot of people who just don't get burlesque.  This is not a nice thing to say, but it has to be said: there's a reason that John Candy and most of the rest of the Toronto Second City troop left Canada so that they could have careers.  For people who get burlesque, the offended reviews of this movie, all of which seem to reduce to classify it as this or that, will just appear as more burlesque.

720832,2,6303854508,"None other than the leftist fire breather Michael Moore lensed ""Canadian Bacon,"" a film that turned into a huge box office bomb. That should serve as the first warning to potential viewers interested in viewing this film. If it doesn't, many other red flags pop up as the movie unfolds. Apparently, some genius in Hollywood thought Moore's documentaries meant that the guy could do a feature film. Wrong. ""Canadian Bacon,"" while boasting an occasionally funny scene or two, is nothing more than propaganda served up on a celluloid bun. The film stars Alan Alda, Kevin Pollack, John Candy (in one of his last film performances, a fact in and of itself noteworthy for fans of the Canadian comedian), Rhea Perlman, Rip Torn, G.D. Spradlin, Stephen Wright, and a host of other familiar faces. With a cast like this, you would think the movie would be an outright tour de force. Wrong again. Before watching this film, you should probably join the National Rifle Association, vote Republican, or simply fly an American flag for a few weeks. Whatever you do, do something to offset this unpleasant slice of good old left wing hate.
Alan Alda plays an American president in trouble with the voting public. With the end of the Cold War and the attendant downsizing of the defense industry, lots of red-blooded American citizens are now out of work, and unemployed workers tend to vote for the other guy. What is a corrupt politician to do? According to Moore, the solution lies in creating a new enemy against which the American people can rally. After a failed attempt to restart a conflict with the tottering Soviet Union, the president and his slimy advisors set their sights on Canada. Urged on by his National Security Advisor Stuart Smiley (Pollack) and General Richard Panzer (Torn), the president sets into motion a flurry of anti-Canadian measures. Before too long, the media joins the fray by broadcasting thinly veiled slurs against the Great White North. An ugly incident at a hockey game in Canada, where American Sheriff Bud Boomer (Candy) starts a riot when he casts an aspersion on Canadian beer, further stokes the fires back home. Everything is really starting to work in the president's favor: the voters rapidly forget about the nation's economic troubles and begin arming themselves to stave off a possible invasion from Canada.
When a few Americans decide to take matters into their own hands and invade Canada themselves, the real trouble starts. Bud Boomer, his girlfriend Honey (Perlman), and a few other brain dead hicks sneak across the border to cause a little disturbance. When some Canadian cops interrupt the fun, the Americans flee back into the United States without realizing they left Honey behind. This mistake leads Boomer and his companions to reinvade Canada in search of their beloved woman, a mission loaded with lots of humorous situations comparing the stupidity and aggressiveness of Americans with the simplicity and friendliness of Canadians. Meanwhile, back in Washington, D.C., the evil corporate boss R.J. Hacker (Spradlin) spurs the White House on in their fake little war games. He tells Stuart Smiley that he sold the Canadians a doomsday device that has the capacity to launch American missiles at the former Soviet Union. Hacker will sell the code to defuse the weapon to the government for a paltry sum of a few billion dollars. What started out as a political ploy to carry the next election has suddenly turned into a scenario involving all out nuclear war.
I am willing to overlook a bit of cant in a movie from time to time, but the avalanche of propaganda in ""Canadian Bacon"" is simply a wonder to behold. Moore skewers everything he hates about America: guns, the military, corporations, the media, patriots, and just about everything else under the sun. R.J. Hacker comes off as a power mad lunatic, the politicians are manipulative cynics, and the movie tars the average American with a generous coating of stupidity and blind patriotism. The latter is surprising since Moore consistently presents himself as the mouthpiece of the downtrodden American worker. But there is the director himself in one scene of the movie, carrying an assault rifle and mouthing jingoistic platitudes about wiping out the Canadians as if to put an exclamation point on his messages. As difficult as it is to swallow these sequences of truly nauseating hate, the movie as a whole is even worse because it isn't funny. Sure, a few scenes made me laugh out loud: the CIA spook outlining the sinister secrets of Canada is a real hoot, as are several of the encounters between Boomer's ""army"" and Canadian citizens. Overall, however, the movie tanks due to its shrill tone.
The American public knew better than to buy into this junk when the movie opened back in the mid 1990s. Moore's recent popularity has inspired a few revisionists to resurrect this mediocre effort in order to sing its praises. Most people who speak about ""Canadian Bacon"" now refer to its prescience concerning the existing administration in the White House--and do so without a trace of irony--as though America's forty-second president didn't try and distract the public from his scandal plagued regime by launching missiles into Afghanistan and Africa. I admit Moore scores some points in this movie, but those barbs jab both ways, folks.

While I was watching it, my visiting mother was in the next room and not really paying attention, but she was laughing because she thought this movie was making fun of Canada, but no Michael Moore could never make fun of his precious Canada. Although there are some Canadaian stereotypes expressed in this movie, the underlying message is that the government (I assume Alan Alda is a Republican president) is stupid and needs an enemy to gain popularity. So who better an enemy than Canada? I think it was Rhea Perlman's character who said, ""Do you smell anything?"" and John Candy's character replied, ""Nothing."" meaning that they were in Canada and that Canada is so clean that they didn't smell any pollution. And then there is another comparison between the US and Canada, looking from clean, wonderful Canada, John Candy and Rhea Perlman look across a river to the US and see a factory with smoke stacks bellowing smoke into the sky and say proudly, ""Home."" Another scene that makes me sick is when there's a sign outside of a gun store that says ""FREE GUNS"" and there's a line of people and they all recieve a free gun. What does this scene say about us, we're all gun nuts? and all have guns? Guess what, there's guns is Canada too.

720909,2,6303854508,"I have noted that opinions of this movie tend to be more negative in Canada.  Some Canadians who miss the point of this movie dislike it because they take offence.  But they are in the minority.  There is no way a film could fill up with so many Canadian actors if it were anti-Canadian, and Michael Moore has great admiration for Canada (where, unlike the U.S., you can easily find reviews of his books in national dailies and national news programs).  In actual fact, the film more often tends to exaggerate how perfect Canada supposedly is.  No, most Canadians know that the actual target of this film is the U.S.  The real problem with the film is that it does a poor job of imitating a form of Canadian humour, and as a result, much of its satirical content is weak and underdeveloped.
One source of much humour in Canada is the large degree of ignorance there is in the U.S. about Canadian culture.  There's even a series of TV specials called ""Speaking With Americans"" in which U.S. citizens (including Congressmen!) are asked questions (and get serious answers!) about such pressing Canadian issues as the melting of the national igloo (which, in case you don't know, doesn't exist).
Besides the proximity of the U.S., the reason why such humour is so pervasive is that it illustrates how one of the most powerful countries in the world is also dangerously self-centered. For example, U.S. politicians believe that they are right to impose U.S. values (not American values -- ""America"" refers to all of North and South America) on foreign countries, including its economic models, etc., while failing to recognize its imperfections or inapplicability to different cultures and countries.  Many economies in Africa and South America have been ruined as a result of such impositions by the World Bank.  U.S. politicians also seem to have the singular ability to fail to learn from models of other countries, creating programs which have failed elsewhere and avoiding programs which have worked elsewhere.  The U.S. also fails to recognize the imporance of many international needs (e.g. the Kyoto Accord) out of pure self-interest.  Lest you think I am being unfair, Canada itself is not perfect (our medical system, although far superior to the U.S.'s, has its major problems), and I would in fact hold some European countries to be better models than either the U.S. or Canada, but what some people ignorantly refer to as Canada's low self-esteem is in fact our greater recognition of ourselves as part of an international community, and our resultant ability to admit to our own imperfections while recognizing it in others as well.  We make fun of the U.S. because in many ways the U.S. is frightening and dangerous.
But while U.S. self-centeredness drives much of the action in this movie with its story of the U.S. government targeting Canada as a hostile country, its satire never reaches such a high level as the similar ""Wag the Dog"" or any of Moore's documentaries by getting lost in one of the symptoms.  For example, its exaggeration of how great our energy system is, while also ignoring our own problems, does little to point out how privatization created the energy crisis in California or profited such pirates as Enron.
These days the film can be seen as a prediction of Bush's careless increase of international tensions with promises of war against Iraq (yes, Saddam is a monster, but Bush's war has little to do with reality) and his careless increase of tensions with North Korea.  However, with the film's focus upon U.S. misperceptions of Canada (a comparatively unimportant symptom of the U.S.'s disease), such serious issues as U.S. foreign policy are not given the focus they deserve as we instead, e.g., witness parodies of our language laws (what I find funniest about the graffiti scene is the RCMP officer's lack of concern over the anti-Canadian messages, thus denying the U.S. invaders the desired effect, and not his admonition that it also needs to also be in French).
To be fair, the U.S. isn't completely self-blinded.  Admittedly, while the U.S. has movies like ""Wag the Dog"", ""Bob Robertson"", etc., I have yet to see a great satirical movie about Canada or Canadian politics.  ""Canadian Bacon"", which is only about perceptions of Canada fails to fill this bill.  It is far too divorced from reality.
Ultimately, this movie only has some minor chuckles and a couple of good laughs going for it, but it isn't great comedy or satire and accomplishes little of what it sets out to do.",1042502400,7,4524,4.885117493472585

720971,5,6303854508,"I wasn't surprised to read the so-called ""professional"" critics blast this movie, they should get real jobs in the first place.  I also wasn't surprised to see most of the ""real"" people who reviewed this movie loved it, as I also thought it was hilarious.  Matter of fact, I only read the reviews of those who DIDN'T like it as I couldn't figure out why anyone wouldn't...but I think I have.  If you check out the unfavorable reviews, you will see they were all written by people who take themselves way too seriously!  How can you expect someone like that to like such a funny movie?  'Canadian Bacon' goes over their heads, the subtle humor is lost on them and they can never laugh at themselves.  Did anyone notice that all the Americans are played by Canadians?  John Candy, Alan Alda, etc.  What a great way to poke fun at Americans poking fun at the Canadians!  I am sure the same people that didn't get this movie are the same ones that realize that the so-called ""racist"" scenes in 'Blazing Saddles' are actually anti-racist.  And what is so remarkable is that both Michael Moore and Mel Brooks can send a message to the world through very funny movies.  This is pure genius!
'Canadian Bacon' isn't a movie you want to rent, it is a movie you want to own.  Why?  Because you have to watch it over and over again to catch all the subtleties, as they are hard to catch when you are laughing your ... off.  Of course, you have to be able to laugh in the first place!

720972,3,6303854508,"...but there's a reason why ""political comedy"" is a genre best utilized by stand-up comedians and political satirists rather than movie production teams.
>
The cast of this movie is fantastic at every level...well-known comedic talents such as Steven Wright and Dan Aykroyd (sp?) settle happily into minor parts and do well to support John Candy (who, as a native Canadian, had to enjoy his role as the over-the-top, trigger-happy U.S. border town's Sheriff's Deputy), and the United States politicians are just as exceedingly incompetent as Michael Moore and the rest of the so-called ""liberal media"" tried to convince us that George H. W. Bush was.  You will certainly be entertained by the efforts of the actors.
>
But this movie does tend to fall under its own weight; the characterizations of both Americans and Canadians is simply too broad to be anything less than material that Mad Magazine might have once rejected...you simply don't FEEL that an effort was made to make any of this believable (although the propaganda piece ""CANADIANS:  THEY WALK AMONG US"" was very entertaining and Kevin Pollack stole every scene he was in).  Overall I enjoyed the movie enough, but most of the reviews I write are based on the notion of whether a DVD is worth owning rather than simply viewing. This one I'm not sure about owning, although at the offered price it's almost disposable.  If you prefer politcial satire removed from the stage, you'll enjoy renting this movie.  But...actually buying it may be a stretch.  A better satire of Canadian life can be found in ""Strange Brew"", eh?!

720978,1,6303854508,"A lackluster president (Alan Alda) with polls to match needs a boost to his popularity.  With the Gulf war now history and the cold war showing no chance of restarting, the attentions of the nation are shifted towards all those boring things like health care, the environment education and other aspects of the economy.  With nowhere to turn, the President's desperate national security adviser (Kevin Pollack) turns to Canada, or more to the point, turns on Canada as the next enemy of the people.  Using the media, the White House now warns Americans to fear their boring northern neighbor which, among other things, hold a strategic edge over America in Zamboni development.  Unfortunately, the campaign works too well, and citizens of a New York town near the Canadian border, fearful that they are on the front line of the next cold war, mobilize for a preemptive strike.  Led by the late-great John Candy and Rhea Perlman, these Americans stage their own foray for the red-white-and-blue, into the mysterious, sinister, but cleaner land to the north.
I have to remind myself that this could have been a funny movie, but it's not even decent.  Director Michael Moore directs as if with a sledgehammer (Levinson and Mamet did a much better job in ""Wag the Dog"") without a trace of subtlety, as if every shot were enough to drive viewers into hysterics.  He gets some good bits but mostly because his players are game - mostly SCTV alum John Candy as the befuddled NY Trooper, but also from a crew of CIA bureaucrats whose only role is to dig up dirt on countries for our politicians to use, and have had years to amass a mountain of it on Canada (""we only think that there aren't so many of them!"").  In the end even these efforts are undermined by partly Moore's conviction that he's the funniest director of all time, but mostly by how his purported social-mindedness actually covers outright condescension of anybody who watches this movie.  But what really kills the movie is how Moore unintentionally mirrors his fictitious politicians: the military is to Hollywood what the Russians (or now the Iraquis) are to our country, a simple target requiring little effort (especially imagination) to amass hatred against.  It's sad that John Candy had to lend his talents to numerous dogs, and this was only one of them.",993600000,6,2322,4.826196473551637

I've seen to many movies that take place in New York and L.A. and Texas and England and Africa (those are where all films take place now a days.) I don't ever see a movie that really takes place in Canada and shows Canadian life. Which to me, is very interesting. There is so much to see in Canada and Canadian life. Rather than joking about legal aliens and illegal aliens and who's country is better, both countries are valuable partners of trade.

7854026,4,6303854508,"This review is for the movie only.

The first 2/3 of this movie is a hilarious satire of US foreign policies.  It's valid today as it was 23 years ago when this movie first came out.  Directed by Michael Moore with Alan Alda playing simply ""Mr. President,"" Moore artfully makes fun of all that is wrong with our foreign policies.  People who understand our foreign policies will find it amusing.  Those who don't, won't.  Even Michael Moore, whose documentaries I find far too biased, is better at making movies with a message than producing documentaries.  He even has a cameo appearance as a redneck in this film.

The plot is simple. The President's approval ratings have dropped and he's worried about being a one-termer.  The president makes a sarcastic comment about starting a war with Canada, because Americans love wars. Why not?  President James Madison tried the same thing with the New York Militia back in 1812, when he ordered them to cross by the Niagara Falls.  That move, by the way, did not go over well.  The ""War of 1812"" lasted three years.

Wars get factories moving again and jobs to the jobless.  But when the president's advisors take him seriously, all feces hits the fan near Niagara Falls. John Candy (RIP), himself Canadian, stars with other Canadian actors like Dan Ackroyd to make a subtle statement: hey, we are just like you Americans!  We have our flaws as well!

There were many one-liners that mock the American foreign policy, Americans' view of guns, our history of racism, and our blind allegiance to patriotism.  The President: ""Is this the best we can come up with?  What about international terrorism?""
General Panzer, Chief of Staff (chuckle!): ""We're not going to reopen up missile factories again, just to fight some creeps running around in exploding rental cars, are we?""  OUCH!  It's funny and sad because that is exactly what we are doing now in 2018.

Or how about these lines, ten minutes before the end:  General Panzer: ""Let me level with you, Sir, I would destroy any nation, even my own, if my president gave me the order.  So you just say the word 'Sir', and we'll do what we should have done in the first place.  We'll nuke those slimy Canuck bastards, I mean it, Sir, we'll wipe their frigid GD country off the map!""
The President:  I can't kill America's neighbors!
Gen Panzer: I can.
The President:  Nice summer up there.
Gen Panzer:  I understand, Sir.

The movie loses some of its comedic effect when one of the characters gets taken hostage. Then the plot turns a bit silly for me. However, the many clever one-liners will still be funny who understand American foreign policy.  If only it were this funny in real life.",1516320000,,2682,4.7075268817204305

Comedy is like smiling. You take a situation that you cannot do anything about, or an attitude that you cannot do anything about, and just laugh at it. This movie is the essence of what many people think they know about Canada. It also contains what many people snicker about, politics. So let's take it to the extreme add John Candy, Rhea Perlman a few eh's, a too clean to be true environment; you have ""Canadian bacon"".

What makes this comedy is not the story but the one-liners and the parody on Canadian life. One of everybody's favorite, is when a truck is stopped because it has obscenities written on the side of it. The authority, OPP Officer (Dan Aykroyd, born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) points out that the obscenity is written only in English and must also be written in French.
