8430540,5,B000007QU2,"Disco 9000 was a mediocre blaxploitation film. It was definitely not Fass Black's best work.  Although, there was only one redeeming aspect to the movie, the acting of former LAPD super-cop Richard Warren. His performance was superb.  He added great depth to the character of Vice Cop #1, so much that I really felt that I was on the mean streets of Los Angeles. As a former student of Richard Warren, my opinion may be biased, but I think it's safe to say that this is the best movie that came out of the 70s.  This is just another testiment to the bias of the academy, warren definately could be in the running for 1976's best supporting actor.  Perhaps a directors cut featuring more footage of this everyday hero would be more approprite.  God bless our troops and God bless America",1096329600,7,786,4.546099290780142
