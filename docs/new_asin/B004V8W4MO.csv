8443065,1,B004V8W4MO,I bought this and only used it once.  It is not challenging at all. And the instructor is kinda annoying.  I bought the 10 Minute Solutions Prenatal Pilates and love it.  I am 36 weeks pregnant and am still doing them everyday.  Wish I had never bought this one.,1386028800,,262,4.285714285714286
8443066,5,B004V8W4MO,"This video is EXACTLY what I needed going on our fifth pregnancy. I needed something that would give me a stretch, burn and make me feel good after and this video did it. I love it IF and I say IF I EVER have ONE more child this video will be in my fitness collection 4 sure!!! Thank you EVA",1377734400,,291,3.8666666666666667
8443067,5,B004V8W4MO,"I've been using this video for about a week and love it. As a mother of two toddlers and one on the way, I enjoy the relaxing ambiance of the video, Eva's soothing voice and the gentle exercises. It's not a super aggressive workout, which I like. I typically do this workout in the afternoon as it leaves me feeling re-energized, which helps me keep up with my little ones. I plan to use this video throughout my pregnancy and will update this review again in a few months.",1360281600,2,473,4.325842696629214
8443068,5,B004V8W4MO,"This video is just what I needed for maintaining flexibility and building strength thru my pregnancy. As my body changed and grew many of the things I used to do to keep fit began to be less practical (trail hiking, jogging, hooping). This video kept me going thru all the body changes and kept me active and flexible right up to the very end when getting off the couch seemed like a huge chore ; ) It is well geared towards the needs of a new mother and a woman preparing to have a natural childbirth. It is not a super aggressive workout for those looking to keep up their pre-pregnancy gym routine but rather a gentle and rejuvenating workout which leaves your body feeling great every time. I feel like it really helped me to stay in touch with my physical self throughout the pregnancy and to have awareness of the changes my body was encountering. I also used light weights when I felt like I was ready for some more resistance. I attribute much of my success in birthing a 10lb. baby naturally in under 3 hrs. to using this video regularly. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased Eva's other pilates video as well after my pregnancy and i love it too!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-from-Hawaii-with-Eva-Bondar/dp/1424306418/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates from Hawaii with Eva Bondar</a>",1344384000,2,1349,5.026785714285714
8443069,2,B004V8W4MO,"I found this DVD to be entirely too easy. I've been regularly doing pilates and yoga at a studio my entire pregnancy. I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant and did this DVD for the first time today. I would only recommend it to beginners who haven't been exercising during pregnancy. I feel like I could have done the whole DVD two more times before I would get an effective workout for my ability. The Kegels section is okay, but even it was not long enough or difficult enough.
The quality of the DVD is average. The background scenery is nice. Sometimes her voice instruction does not line up with what is happening on screen.
Overall I would, again, only recommend this DVD to beginners. I don't think I will be getting much use out of this DVD.",1343865600,,743,4.470588235294118
8443070,5,B004V8W4MO,"This workout is so great!  I was able to continue it through my entire pregnancy without difficulty, and was even able to add some resistance (1.5# weight cuffs) as able to increase the strength training element for arms and legs.  Eva's verbal directions and easy to follow visual references make it easy to maintain proper form in order to maximize your workout.  When eight months pregnant easy workouts were what it was all about for me!  I would recommend this workout for all my friends if they were pregnant!",1308355200,3,515,4.752808988764045
