374544,4,6301900154,"This would make a great addition to any Reagan enthusiast's library.  It really took me back in time.  Ted Koppell [sic?]looked like a kid!  My primary frustration with it was that it didn't provide hardly any coverage of the actual campaigning that got Reagan there in the first place.  (It would have been particularly nice to see him duking it out with then rival-George Bush.)  But, it's ABC News, so what do you expect?  It's great for taking a walk down memory lane (of course, I was only 5 years old at the time), but if it's a great Reagan documentary you're looking for, then try the A&E Biography of Reagan, or, better yet, the one Barbara Walters did a couple of years back entitled, ""The Unlikely Life of Ronald Reagan"".",981763200,3,732,4.549618320610687
374545,5,6301900154,I think Ryan's story is one that we all will remember in years to come.  Ryan fought hard and long with AIDS.  I personally knew him and he was never down or depressed about having AIDS.  I think Ryan's legacy should live on forever.,972259200,,233,4.25

374547,4,6301900154,"I was deeply impressed by the in depth coverage of the dastardly deeds  what was perhaps Panama last great dictator.  I was extremely surprised at  how Noreiga cleverly manipulated the Great South American Flying Train to  smuggle illegal contraband over international waters. Sadly the fate of  this great man lied on the 80's song ""We're Not Going to Take It""  as the general, who was by the time the seige was over only a shell of the  former tyrant he had been, was forced into submission.  I would have rated  this documentary a five, had it not so awkardly and obviously avoided  mentioning the suspected possible connection and accomplice General Thomas  ""Chavez"" Hinds.  It was almost as though the author was  attempting to cover up some horrible truth.",959212800,2,762,4.859375
374548,5,6301900154,"This video is a compilation of all 17 days of coverage of the skyjacked TWA jetliner in the Middle East in June of 1985.  From Beirut to Algiers to America, ABC's best coverage is brought together well in this hour long  video.  Feels like you're watching it back when it really happened.  A  great idea for a video and well produced!",950659200,,334,4.409836065573771
374549,2,6301900154,"An avid Lucille Ball fan, I have been trying to add every video I can to my collection.  Since there is not alot in the biographical area of the great comdian, I purchased this video in hopes of learning more about the  great queen of comedy.  This episode of Nightline is hosted by Jeff  Greenfield, not Ted Koppel.  After the first 5 to 10 minutes of clips  (mostly from ""I Love Lucy""), the program tells little about Lucy,  her life or her death.  The guests are Sid Ceasar and Jerry Lewis.  Neither  are very touching.  The questions asked by Jeff Greenfield are lame.  This  is not a tribute to Lucy, it's not even a decent piece of reporting by the  ABC News team.  Were it not for one comment from Jerry Lewis and the fact  it is about Lucy, I would have only given it one star.  Spend your money on  another selection.",921024000,68,826,4.287581699346405

7816364,5,6301900154,"This interview was done in 1984, so I was surprised that the tape was in such good condition.  As for the content, anyone who interviews Qaddafi should know that he does not give straight answers.  In fairness, how many world leaders do?  I was not surprised that he evaded some of Mr. Koeppel's questions or denied allegations.  This interview was done when the world was beginning to hold on to Qaddafi's every word (before the 1986 attack on Libya),and it was fascinating.  Also, Qaddafi was young and gorgeous (he's still handsome) so who wouldn't want to look at him?",1186531200,,572,4.737373737373737
7816365,1,6301900154,"I purchased this in hopes of learning something new about the seige at Ruby Ridge. However, it was only 22 minutes in length, and offered nothing that I did not already know and know well. It was more of an opinion piece, rather than informational. Skip it.",1106438400,,257,4.48936170212766
7816366,1,6301900154,"Geez, what a huge and expensive disappointment. Don't be fooled by that other review saying that this is a detailed description of what happened.

First of all, it's only 23 minutes long, second; it contains no actual footage of what happened, no footage of the afternath; just a newsbroadcast, with an animation of a meltdown.

This is the actual broadcast of 1986, just days after the disaster, when nothing was a fact, and there only where rumours about what happened, because Russia kept silence.

After a long time, the world got to know what actually happened and how big the disaster was, and what the consequences were, but none of this is included on this tape. As I said, it contains a short news broadcast of a period when they didn't even know exactly what had happened. So there are only speculations about what could have happened, and what consequences it COULD have, when indeed that happened what they think had happened. But nothing was certain at that point.

Very disappointing and boring!",1105056000,10,1009,4.815028901734104
7816367,3,6301900154,"I was disappointed with this video.  I am a professor at a liberal arts college and wanted to show my Environmental Science class a video about the Chernobyl disaster.  I was hoping to find a documentary that explained the disaster in detail, provided a critical assessment about what went wrong, and discussed the impacts of the disaster on people in the local and regional area.  Given the limited description of the video and a positive review from another reviewer I hoped that this would be what I wanted.

Unfortunately, what the video shows is an ABC Nightline commentary about the disaster recorded on April 28, 1986 (3 days after the disaster).  That is, it is simply a 30 min newscast recorded a very short time after the accident.

The quality of the reporting is very good considering it was made so soon after the event and during a time when the western press knew almost nothing about what was happening behind the iron curtain.  However, almost all of the commentary is speculative.  Indeed, they don't even mention the name Chernobyl (though it does appear on one map late in the program).

Thus, from my point of view this video was useless.  From a teaching perspective, it is an interesting piece of video and could be useful as part of a journalism course.  From a personal perspective, it is kind of interesting to see an old newscast, but it gets a bit tedious considering the speakers know essentially nothing about what happened.

Overall, this video is an interesting anachronism, but in no way will it help you gain a better understanding of the Chernobyl disaster.",1095206400,14,1592,4.7700729927007295
7816368,5,6301900154,"1 year later after he was diagnosed with AIDS, he was discriminated from school. He wanted to go back, but his mom, Jeanne White, didn't know if that's necessary for him to try and fight, but he's persistant and he doesn't want to give up his fight. So August of 1985 to April 10th, 1986, Ryan and his mom went to court with their attorney for a nine-month court battle. By February 21st, he and his mother lost and felt as though they were hit hard. On April 10th, Ryan & his mom won in court, but by the following year in the summer of '87, they left Kokomo to move to an open-minded, AIDS educated town of Cicero where he was welcomed because people didn't want him to suffer any more pain. Eversince Ryan was on the news a lot and had a small role as Chad in his own movie, people, including AIDS victims admired his courage.",1041552000,8,829,4.220125786163522
7816369,3,6301900154,"Although this 22 minute Nightline broadcast doesn't have that much to offer, you'd still think ABC would rebroadcast it if only in the hopes of combatting the ""let's bomb those towelheads"" idiocy that's no doubt sprung up in some sectors. The general sentiment, of course, is that Muslims are everywhere and that 99.9% of them aren't evil. If you make any attempt at all to be responsibly informed, this video won't change your life, although you might find the bits about the predominance of muslims in Iowa interesting. I did. Ultimately, this one's for the classroom.",1014595200,,570,4.947916666666667
7816370,5,6301900154,"Upon doing an assignment for my college class on the topic of AIDS, I instantly knew I could choose to speak about Ryan White, for he was the true defintion of a hero. I remember watching this special on ABC's Dateline as a small girl and now 12 years after his [passing], I can still remember his story as if I heard it only yesterday. I would most definitely recommend this video to anyone who hopes to gain a better perspective on what living a life with AIDS must truly be like. But most importantly I recommend this video because it not only educates the mind but also touches the heart.",1012089600,13,592,4.342342342342342
7816371,5,6301900154,"this video is great for people whose lives have been touched by Ryan and his story, but are too young to remember him.",1009584000,4,118,4.173913043478261
