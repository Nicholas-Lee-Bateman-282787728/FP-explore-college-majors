7878435,5,6304838050,"I first saw Pilobolus decades ago at the American Dance Festival. I was not sure it was dance or acrobatics, but I liked it. All these years later after many reinventions of the group, they are still amazing in their strength, movements, and novelty, and they have added movements to the vocabulary of contemporary dance. There is nothing quite like them, but if Merce Cunnningham does dance, then this must be dance too. And I still like it.",1478131200,,442,4.67948717948718

7878437,4,6304838050,I'm not a fan of Modern Dance but I love Pilobolus. They find many ways to simulate slow motion and create creatures with their bodies in ways that you forget that they are made of human bodies. I saw this when it appeared on PBS TV many years ago and was disappointed that this doesn't contain the whole show.,1288915200,,310,4.271186440677966
7878438,5,6304838050,"I have yet to see Pilobolus live, but I know from their video alone that they are one of my favorite dance companies.  Supple, flowing bodies doing things you never knew were possible... tricks on the eye.... gorgeous soundscapes... interviews with the dancers themselves... if you like modern dance which is stunningly original yet crowd-pleasing, rich in athleticism AND thought-provoking, never pretentious, and just weird and wild, buy this video.",1115337600,7,451,5.442857142857143
