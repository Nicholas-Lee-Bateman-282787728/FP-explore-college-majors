7337647,5,B011MUA8OO,Clearly this show is for a select audience- but it is brilliant and highly evolved- not for tribal mentality-,1450224000,,109,4.7894736842105265
7337648,5,B011MUA8OO,"I'll start off by saying that this show will only be lauded by a niche audience. Those who get it, understand the turmoil that the Payne family go through and appreciate their unique world view. If this sounds appealing to you, don't hesitate in buying this DVD. If it doesn't really peak your interest...Hell, give it a try anyway.",1448496000,2,332,4.6440677966101696
7337649,5,B011MUA8OO,This is one of the best TV shows I have ever watched.  Much thought and excellent writing went into this series.  It addresses many timely issues realistically.  Some people may feel uncomfortable with the reality of the situations.  I truly wish it had not been canceled.  I am buying this Season 1 (and only season) just so I can re-watch and re-hear the thoughts and ideas so well presented in Happyish.,1445644800,3,406,4.661971830985915
7337650,1,B011MUA8OO,If i could i would have given this a minus 10! I am not easily offended but this show managed to do it. Whats happened to good taste?,1444694400,,133,3.7857142857142856
7337651,1,B011MUA8OO,"Oh dear!  You manage to get a comic genius like Steve Coogan - one of the funniest men on the planet, if not THE funniest - and you hand him this crap.  Constant use of the 'f' word and liberated sexspeak does not a hip show make.  It tried too hard and it shows.  Horrible.",1443744000,,274,3.9272727272727272

8724732,5,B011MUA8OO,Great show! Im sad more people don't get what this show was really about. Only one season?,1515283200,,90,4.352941176470588
8724733,3,B011MUA8OO,"The funniest parts of the show come from its depiction of life in the modern advertising industry. Imagine the characters of Mad Men trying to cope in the world of social media and viral videos. The two twenty something Swedes who run this new world are hilarious. Less funny and more clumsily presented is the story of a couple who hates their life despite many trappings of success. He hates his high paying job and theyve moved to Woodstock, NY because thats the brand which means getting back to the land. The husband commutes to Manhattan by commuter train (in itself hysterical because its logistically impossible). They worship their young only child, who seems very fragile and destined to be a basket case. They and other parents desperately sneak out for cigarettes, pot, and wine and every opportunity because the need to attend to their childrens every need exhausts them. She makes art because thats who she is even though its unclear whether its any good. So we get it, and its funny enough, but its hard at times to get behind the characters.",1514592000,,1057,4.75
8724734,5,B011MUA8OO,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this show. Since Season 2 was never picked up, I get my fix by binge-watching Season 1. It makes me HAPPY! On with the pursuit... :0)",1514505600,,148,4.137931034482759
8724735,3,B011MUA8OO,Show was ok,1482969600,,11,3.0
8724736,5,B011MUA8OO,Liked the fresh honesty of the writing. Sardonic view of today's society.,1474675200,,73,5.166666666666667
8724737,5,B011MUA8OO,"One of the best shows you'll ever see, it deserved far better praise and acknowledgment than it got. It's not a ""family-friendly"" show, there is a lot of cursing (but Game of Thrones curses all the time and people still love that show). Happyish is definitely an intellectually stimulating show. If you have any interest in philosophy or philosophers definitely pick it up. I so very much wish there could have been a season 2, but at the very least I could imagine this show becoming a cult classic in time. Happyish is unafraid to peel into the harsh realities of corporate mentality, capitalism on overdrive, and the ever more complex challenge of achieving the pursuit of happiness in the 21st century.",1470009600,,706,4.795081967213115
8724738,5,B011MUA8OO,"Steve Coogan is superb as always, Show is highly addictive. It very high IQ show.
It is hilarious and super smart at the same time. It touches  many things in
pretty brave way,  no wonder that they shut it down. Absolutely the best show in the very long time.
The casting is incredible. Fab acting and awesome characters.",1455408000,,321,4.517241379310345
8724739,5,B011MUA8OO,"If you work in advertising, this series is a must-watch. A far more accurate picture of this crazy biz than the one painted in Mad Men, this darkly comic one and only season promises to provoke, appall, disgust, and elicit no small amount of belly laughter. It's a shame Showtime cancelled the series; I just hope Shalom will be given another shot to visit his special brand of dark 'n funny on us once again.",1453248000,,409,4.466666666666667
