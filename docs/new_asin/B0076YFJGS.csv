5058564,1,B0076YFJGS,A weak story line but thats not the worst of it. The fight scenes are so unbelievable it's scary.  They really resemble a karate demonstration thrown together for halftime at a high school basketball game.  A lot of high kicks from a couple of little girls supposedly knocking a room full of powerfull men silly. Really!  This movie and others like it are stricktly for the I never made it past yellow belt crowd.  I'm all for creativity in a movie but let's try to make the battles somewhat within the realm of possibilty.,1383955200,,523,4.531914893617022
5058565,5,B0076YFJGS,i think im in love with rina takeda she os a great martial artist and has been in some real good movies,1377216000,,103,3.727272727272727
5058566,5,B0076YFJGS,"Luv me some Rina Takeda!!!  Since I am a 4th dan I'm going to beat her up and force her to marry me. She's GREAT!!! Better than frosted flakes. On the serious side, no wires, no springboards, no weird camera angles, no stunt doubles, nothing fake or tricky. Not only does Rina perform her own action sequences but so does every character in the film.",1371427200,11,350,4.384615384615385
5058567,4,B0076YFJGS,Better than High kick girl by far in my opinion story is still relatively cheesy but not as much slow motion effects which is for sure a good improvement.,1368316800,,154,4.344827586206897
5058568,5,B0076YFJGS,"I first saw the trailer for this film on youtube as I was searching for martial arts techniques. Then I went ahead and rented the film elsewhere, and was blown away by the story! The beginning sequence is well done in terms of providing motivation to get this story moving forward to its resolution. I enjoyed the action displayed by Rina Takeda and the other martial artists. It wasn't too unbelievable and it wasn't ruined by bad cinematography. To sum up the story, we see the bad guy come into a dojo to steal a black belt. I still don't understand why. He sends his gang in on the rampage who kill the head Karate Sensei and his students. They even attack his two daughters! Believing that one child is dead, he kidnaps the other, I guess so that he can raise her using his style of Karate? Before dying the Karate Sensei manages to resuscitate his daughter, helping her breathe again. She's, played by Rina Takeda, who grows up to become phenomenal at Karate. Meanwhile the bad guy takes notice of her and seeks to finish his revenge upon her fallen father. I think that's enough to sum it up. Don't want to ruin it for viewers. I highly recommend this film! It's good!!!",1362355200,9,1177,4.47906976744186
5058569,4,B0076YFJGS,"Its was good, not great but not bad. Seemed almost the same as One- Chanbara (bikini samurai girls) as far as the sister being split up and fighting against each other. Could have had more realistic confrontations to make the fight action sequences much better. My four stars was because it wasn't in english dub, well the version i got. Don't get me wrong, english dubbed is only perfectly great if they have right voices for the right characters and the voice actors truly know how to speak their acting parts right. So far my all time best new girl/ female martial arts movie is Chocolate. Theres nothing more entertaining then watching so called hard attitude people male or female getting their butts handed to them by a little retarded girl. No disrespect intended.",1357862400,,771,4.7611940298507465
5058570,5,B0076YFJGS,"Rina Takeda is a joy to watch beautiful and an amazing martial artist. I loved this movie, the action was top notch.",1355961600,5,116,4.318181818181818
5058571,3,B0076YFJGS,"This movie is far better than any american karate kid film but it does not make you want to see it more than twice. A sequel would be worth watching if Rina Takeda continued the storyline or even a tv series. Takeda could definetly make a good X-23 role in a wolverine film. This movie is more watchable than Kunoichi so if you have an afternoon to do nothing,pop it in the dvd and watch.",1353801600,3,388,4.1866666666666665
5058572,4,B0076YFJGS,"For the fans who like Rina Takeda,Karate Girl is great, I love it, lots of action,great photography, this is better than her High kick girl, though both are great,karate girl has a better story.",1339286400,7,194,4.735294117647059
5058573,4,B0076YFJGS,"Karate Girl has been referred to as High Kick Girl 2  in some circles. It's better and more polished than HKG 1. Rina has progressed in her acting  and her martial arts skills have improved or the choreography has improved. KG has an A-movie feel to it ,partly due to the soundtrack sounding more professional and fits better with the movie. I bought KG when it first came out in Japan , so I'm looking forward to the english version when it comes out in April. I gave it 4 stars , because I think Rina will only get better with time.",1330387200,15,534,4.2254901960784315

5058597,4,B0076YFJGS,I was so floored by this movie. The two girls in it are real life Karate masters and the film has no CGI or stunt doubles in it. Everything is real. Watch the behind the scenes of it on the disc too. These girls kick butt.,1409097600,2,222,3.847826086956522

5058599,1,B0076YFJGS,The language in this film is Japanese with English subtitles.  I didn't check on that so for that reason wouldn't suggest it.  We stopped watching it almost immediately.,1405555200,,169,5.0
5058600,5,B0076YFJGS,I Really enjoyed this movie i like action and martial arts movies. I'm a martial artist myself i saw this movie on netflix and checked it out and i liked it the action is good and the story is as well it's about the spirit and the tradition of karate i'm glad for that so bought this movie. Rina Takeda her karate is very good this is my first time seeing one of her movies she's the real deal there's also another girl in the movie i don't know her name but her karate is very good as well. If you like action and martial arts movies and a strong female character this movie is for you.,1394668800,3,587,4.0256410256410255
5058601,3,B0076YFJGS,"Perhaps I got this movie for the wrong reason, hoping that Tatsuya Naka would have a major role in it, as he did in High Kick Girl.  I found the story on this movie to be no more or less stupid than High Kick Girl's, but there was less for those of us interested in great Japanese/Okinawan karate and more for those who are big fans of Rina Takeda and taekwondo-style acrobatic kicking.  Because I don't find her martial arts abilities nearly as compelling as Naka-sensei's, I was disappointed that he had only a minor role.  I don't find the acrobatics and somewhat laughable scenarios involving children fighting adults in this movie interesting, but if you are a fan of acrobatics and taekwondo-style kicking, you will likely enjoy this movie.  If you are looking for something more along the lines of a comic book story with great traditional Shotokan karate action by the hero, check out High Kick Girl.  If you are looking for a more serious and thoughtful karate film with many of the same actors and production team, I can't recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Belt/dp/B001F0TT2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Belt</a>&nbsp;highly enough.",1391731200,,1204,5.382978723404255

I can recomend it if you like karate films",1388102400,,106,4.095238095238095
5058603,1,B0076YFJGS,"I know about Japanese karate because I am a brown belt in Shotokan.

THIS is an Absurd movie, with a truly trite and weird plot, acting, and phony ""karate.""

Silly characters, plot, and script. Silly production vales. Awful cinematography.

I recommend you give this a miss; it was a waste of time for me and I could only watch it for 42 minutes.",1386892800,,346,4.4603174603174605

8511210,4,B0076YFJGS,"Rina Takeda is awesome. Fairly good plot, fight scenes authentic, no camera games, no stunt doubles. Just saw her in Dead Sushi, hilarious and goofy. They just don't make movies like this in Hollywood, too politically correct, too contrived.",1522886400,,241,5.205128205128205
8511211,5,B0076YFJGS,Impressive.  The movie will end much sooner than you'd like it too.  Rina Takeda plays her part well but the action scenes are without fail stolen by they younger Hina Tobimatsu.,1509753600,,178,4.709677419354839

8511218,3,B0076YFJGS,"The action is pretty phenomenal in this one, and no question the star, Rina Takeda is both exceptionally beautiful and a true master in her martial art. She's fast, precise, and delivers her punches and kicks with power and believability. No gravity defying stunts and nothing that breaks the laws of physics (though I do enjoy anime and some of the Hong Kong style of martial arts too). Her acting isn't bad either! She very wisely tends toward a more ""understated"" delivery of her dialogue and acting. Whereas a number of the other actors, especially the unintentionally hilarious bad-villain are often way over the top. The overall choreography was also well done, as was most of the photography, though occasionally they resort to some pretty cliched techniques (the old Van Damme double hit or kick for example). Mostly though it's a solid movie and they did a lot with seemed like a little as far as budget.

The Good: Aside from what I already mentioned, the actual fight scenes were by and large pretty incredible. As another reviewer said, these felt very real in  most instances and the actors on the losing side truly looked like they were hurting pretty badly sometimes. Most of the exterior shots and general setup was well filmed, and of some were less controlled than we are used it, to me it lent a groundedness. The adopted ""sister"" of the main star also was a good counterpoint to all the action oriented characters. I alos really liked some of the shots that showed everyday life for the characters (like working at a movie theater)

The Not So Good (or Bad):
The setup is pretty cringe inducing, especially with the WORST sounding cliched voice-over in the opening scenes! It's too bad that someone hadn't taken the time to work out a story that was even a LITTLE more credible. This obsession of a coveted antique black belt (from a famous teacher) made absolutely no sense whatsoever. Having this as the central plot device just left so much kind of hanging by a thread.

The other very odd aspect of the movie was that twice we have a situation where the actors are around a number of other people, and then suddenly everyone is gone- all so as to add ""drama"" to a big fight scene I think. But it's just a jarring transition and not needed at all. I assume that budget had something to do with it too, but still! Pretty much all ""bad guys"" were cardboard characters, and most of them either couldn't act all and just grimaced or looked ""tough""- or like the main villain hammed it up as much as possible.

In the end, you like I, probably know what you in for. The only REAL reason we watch it is the martial arts, and for that it's both fun and thrilling.",1466899200,2,2678,4.570833333333334
