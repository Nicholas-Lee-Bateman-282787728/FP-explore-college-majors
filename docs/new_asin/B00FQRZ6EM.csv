6020426,5,B00FQRZ6EM,Four really good movies for the movies for TV watchers. A great combination of movies to put together on one DVD set.,1479081600,,117,4.363636363636363
6020427,1,B00FQRZ6EM,"This DVD is a total dud.  It won't even play the main movie, never mind the bonus ones. I totally wasted $6. Avoid!",1477440000,,115,4.0

6020431,1,B00FQRZ6EM,quality so poor I am never going to watch it,1468713600,,44,3.5
6020432,1,B00FQRZ6EM,"From the cover, you would think all three actors are in ""Netforce."" Not so. The movie with Sandra Bullock has poor acting, poor sound, and the video quality is equivalent to a poorly made 1970s ""bootleg."" I wouldn't even call it a B movie. It's more like a D-. Sandra Bullock looks like she may have been in her teens in this film. The other three movies are not so good B movies. The only actor pictured on the cover that appears in ""Netforce"" is Scott Bakula.",1465430400,,461,4.310344827586207
6020433,3,B00FQRZ6EM,ok,1461715200,,2,2.0
6020434,3,B00FQRZ6EM,"As expected, even with the excellent acting, there's not much you can do with a 1999 TV mini series transferred to DVD, obviously without remastering. The Video was of mediocre quality, with the obvious breaks for each segments showing. The story line was OK, considering that this was supposed to be 2018. It was strung out quite a bit to fill the time slots for a TV show. A bit of a disappointment. The old stereo sound was of acceptable quality, barely.

The plus was that I got to see the young Scott Bakula and CCH Pounder, who both star in the current series, NCIS New Orleans.

As to packaging quality, the clip that holds the disk in the box was broken, and the surface of the DVD had light scratches, but played OK. I haven't watched the other two movies, as yet.",1461542400,5,773,4.398601398601398
6020435,5,B00FQRZ6EM,Interesting movie.,1461283200,,18,8.5

6020443,2,B00FQRZ6EM,I'm glad this was inexpensive because it's not the best work of these stars.,1446595200,,76,4.5
6020444,1,B00FQRZ6EM,This is 3 movies.  The one with a very young Sandra Bullock was hard to stay awake for the whole movie.  The movie with Scott Bakula was also hard to stay awake for.  We haven't watched the 3rd movie yet.  Yawns!,1445299200,4,212,4.097560975609756

6020449,3,B00FQRZ6EM,Even though Sandra Bullock appears on the cover she has a very limited roll in this movie. Still for we Sandra Fans it is a welcome addition to my collection. Not a watch repeatedly movie like most of her others.,1441670400,4,212,4.325

6020475,1,B00FQRZ6EM,Hate it when you get a knocked off version of a DVD. There are no subtitles on this DVD. Some people it might not matter. But there are alot of people out there that this might matter. Found a used one for about the same price. Sending this one back. thank goodness for Amazon Prime I can.,1402531200,4,289,4.087719298245614
6020476,2,B00FQRZ6EM,"ANY of the other Tom Clancy movies is better than this one. Net Force is watchable; that is about all I will say about this one. This movie was clearly made before the advent of CG imagery, which is a shame because i think the same movie would benefit from a complete remake.  The idea of the Netforce ""internet"" as portrayed in this movie was a downright tame compared to the world conjured up in Clancy's novels. At least they had the little VR sets close to what I had imagined.

PLEASE do not get fooled into thinking you're getting a bargain by the inclusion of 3 additional movies; yes, these are movies, and yes, they are full length movies, but that is a BAD thing. When I watched Hangman I thought to myself ""Hmm - early Charles Bronson with bad 70's era acting?"".  I couldn't tell if these 3 bonus films were supposed to be Net Force movies, but none of the plots rang a bell with any of the books I had read. The acting - abysmal.",1393891200,15,941,4.245810055865922
6020477,5,B00FQRZ6EM,I choose this rating since I liked the book and the movie was really good too.  There were another three movies as bonus's on the DVD which might it a great value for the price.,1391817600,5,177,4.057142857142857
6020478,4,B00FQRZ6EM,"However, two of the other three movies were not worth the time.  If you are buying this DVD for Net Force then, you will get your money's worth.",1388275200,5,144,4.142857142857143

8618053,1,B00FQRZ6EM,Our decision to purchase this movie was in great part based on the cover. Don't make the same mistake we did. Especially if you're a Sandra Bullock fan. She must have been about 19 years old when this movie was made.,1487808000,,216,4.2926829268292686
