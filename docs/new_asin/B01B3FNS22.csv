8749202,5,B01B3FNS22,Very interesting video. Very well done.  My wife inherited a 1956 B3 in perfect working order and I was looking for information on the Hammond Organ when I came across this CD.  Amazing history on both the organ and the artists that play the instrument.,1486512000,,253,4.6
8749203,5,B01B3FNS22,"WOW!  Such a gooey, wet, horny kiss love-athon for an instrument!  An inanimate object.

Ah, but the beast comes to vivid, funky life in the hands of the master musicians profiled in this film.

And the Hammond organ is due such a tribute, which you know if youve seen Jimmy Smith, Joey D, or Pat Bianchi tear it up.

Bianchi isn't in the film, but otherwise its pretty much a whos who of organists, and they comment on their love affair with the instrument.  You also get fascinating details about the history and invention of the B3.  The odd thing about this organ is that, in a jazz club, its usually difficult for the audience to actually see the players hands.  A frustration that is remedied by the moments of performance scattered thruout this film. And then in the bonus feature there are 3 extended performances.  All the bonuses are good, and Tony Monaco and trio are just on fire! -- a phenomenal tour de force.

Highly recommended.",1478131200,,944,4.565476190476191

8749205,5,B01B3FNS22,"Killer B3 is a fascinating journey in the story of the famed B3 Hammond organ. If when you hear the word ""organ"" and you think of church music, think again.  ""Producer, director and writer Murv Seymour and Joe Bamford tell a lovely story of the Hammond Organ company, from its early and humble beginnings, to the height of the instrument's popularity, when it was played in night clubs across America in Jazz, blues, and gospel bands.

The soundtrack is fabulous and will have you tapping your toes in rhythm with the amazing musicians who's fingers seemingly dance across the keyboards.

Production qualities are fabulous, and this important documentary will leave a warm spot in your heart, and maybe even a little teary- eyed as you learn about this artists and amazing instrument, aka The Beast.

 I highly recommend this amazing DVD!

 Thank you.",1455235200,,851,4.909090909090909
8749206,5,B01B3FNS22,Who would have thought there was so much history and soul in an organ. Killer B3 is an excellent documentary. Murv Seymour you did an excellent job with this one. So much informatio. Very well organized.,1454803200,,203,4.666666666666667
8749207,5,B01B3FNS22,"I heard the hammond organ in many of the bands and genres I like but never knew where 'that sound' was coming from.  Killer B3 gives you the history, and shows you many of the legends that still play this amazing instrument.  Having personally met Murv (one of the producers) and seeing his passion for music, I had to watch the documentary.  Definitely a must see for any true music fan.",1454803200,,388,4.436619718309859
8749208,5,B01B3FNS22,"Having talked at length with the directors of Killer B3, Murv Seymour and Joe Bamford I know how much of their blood, sweat & tears went into this project, and what a killer result.  If you have only a smattering of awareness about the Hammond B3, by the end of this superbly constructed film your knowledge will have increased exponentially.  B3 fans will discover interesting and illuminating details that will heighten their appreciation for this amazing instrument.  Without the leap of faith by Messers Seymour & Bamford in taking on the colossal task of producing this documentary, the organ may have faded into musical obscurity.  They've given the Hammond B3 a life-saving injection of interest by gathering together a plethora of distinguished players whose credentials speak for themselves and who individually and collectively bring to life those beguiling and bewitching nuances of the B3's extraordinary versatility.  There's nothing to not like about this engaging and engrossing infotainment.",1454803200,,1007,5.388535031847134
8749209,5,B01B3FNS22,This film is amazing! The producers really captured the true gem of the Hammond organ. They visit all the sites that make the Hammond world famous! The people in the film have a love for the Hammond and it shows!,1454457600,,212,4.325
