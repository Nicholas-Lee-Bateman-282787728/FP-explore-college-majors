8178876,3,B000NJXBXG,"""Diamond Geezer"" is a crime caper British television series starring the popular actor Sir David Jason. The British mystery series was made by Granada for Britain's ITV (Independent Television). It's a light-hearted, playful look at aging criminal mastermind Des, as played by Jason, a performer who has been voted Britain's most popular actor three times in recent years by the National Television Awards. The pilot was one of Britain's top five most-watched dramas of 2005; three more episodes were produced and aired in 2007.

Jason is a winner of three BAFTAs and three Best Actor awards from the British Comedy Award, as well as their lifetime achievement award. He starred in the most popular sitcom (Only Fools and Horses - The Complete Collection  ) and as the most popular TV detective (DI Jack Frost, A Touch of Frost - Series 1-15 Complete ),as voted by the British public. Guest stars include Jenny Agutter ( Masterpiece Theatre: Railway Children, Logan's Run ). Also Simon Williams ( Upstairs Downstairs: The Complete Series ), Christopher Cazenove, A Knight's Tale , and Roy Marsden (Inspector Dalgleish, of the P.D. James televised mysteries, PD James: The Adam Dalgliesh Chronicles .)

The episodes are:
1. Rough Diamond (pilot). Nobody at Barton Prison ever thought there was anything more to limping, stuttering, apparently simple old man Des. Boy, were they wrong.
2. A Royal Affair. Scotland Yard seemingly tracks Des down, in his new luxurious life on the French Riviera, and blackmails him into stealing a priceless jewel from Buckingham Palace. Features Jenny Agutter.
3. Old Gold. Des seeks a rumored KGB stash of eight million pounds somewhere in London. Features Cazenove, and Marsden.
4. Old School Lies. The death of a young friend sets Des after Jeremy Leyfield, (Simon Williams) ruthless, thieving corporate consultant, who's particularly fond of companies' pension funds. This episode seemed to me to have an almost surrealistic quality: it's also the one that most strongly resembles the ""Ocean's 11"" series in that Des assembles a large criminal team for the job.

You might best think of the series, in fact, as ""OCEANS 13"" lite: it's got much the same roguish charm, though done, of course, with a much smaller, TV-sized budget. It's fun, and a good vehicle for Jason's small screen-sized charisma.",1452211200,,2333,5.131578947368421
