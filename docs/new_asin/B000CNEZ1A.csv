8099562,5,B000CNEZ1A,"My husband, a rugby player, and I really enjoy this movie.  We are huge rugby supporters, fans, and players.  Well done, serious, funny, well put together.  Very much enjoyed!",1376956800,,175,4.9655172413793105
8099563,5,B000CNEZ1A,"Kudos to Spence for spending countless hours and a significant amount of his time and money to create this documentary.  While the era of segregated ""gay-only"" teams and rodeos may not have staying power, this has potential historical significance in exploring the social dynamics that took place at that time,  driving many to seek out or form gay-friendly groups.  It's worthwhile viewing, if anything to understand the genesis of the Bingham Cup.",1203638400,,449,5.208333333333333
8099564,5,B000CNEZ1A,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Straight-Acting/dp/B000CNEZ1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Straight Acting</a>&nbsp;All young gay men should watch this film. It definitely reflects a portion of our community that that becomes invisible due to society's preconcieved notions of what a gay man should be or act like. Butch boys who have yet to find their way and place in the gay world will definitely benefit from veiwing this film.  Excellent documentary. Prize-worthy.",1201046400,3,505,6.890625
8099565,5,B000CNEZ1A,"I had never heard the term ""straight acting"" although after watching the film I realized that I know quite a few men who fit the description. The film challenges our stereotypes of masculinity and femininity by introducing us to men who embrace both being gay and their athleticism or at least their love of sport. The director's personal journey definitely hits home because the film is ultimately about being yourself and breaking out of self or other imposed boundaries.",1196035200,3,473,5.0
8099566,5,B000CNEZ1A,"I highly recommend this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would give it 6 stars if I could just for the subject matter. For a short documentary this covers a lot of great territory. It is informative, humorous and entertaining.

One of my friends couldn't relate to it. He has never been passionate about any sport and can't remember when he wasn't ""out"". Good for him. However, many LGBT people have difficulties while trying to overcome stereotypes, fears and prejudices both in themselves and in others. Coming out, in part, is about forging an open, honest and integrated life.

This movie seems to be about just that; forging an integrated life. For LGBT people who either grew up playing ""straight"" in sports, or who picked up sports after coming out, this is their story. An integrated life; with all the passion of sports and with people who accept you scrapes bruises and all, it is awesome.",1145750400,13,900,4.762820512820513
8099567,5,B000CNEZ1A,"I saw this movie at NewFest in New York. It's about this guy who joins a gay rugby team. It's pretty much about how he and other guys like him don't fit into traditional ""gay"" life, but they are gay, and they want to be able to play their sports and live their lives and not have to fake it. There was a lot of humor, and I some of the guys he talks to were really articulate. Overall, the film was sweet and heartfelt. I even got a little tear at the end, when he, the main guy Spencer, cut his head open in a game in England. I recommend it. It's good to screw with people's stereotypes.",1133913600,18,589,3.957983193277311
