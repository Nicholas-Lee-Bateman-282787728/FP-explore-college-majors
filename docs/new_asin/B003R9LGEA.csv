8403403,5,B003R9LGEA,"There is not another bicycle race in the world that compares to the bone breaking, hand blistering, butt bashing and head jarring torture dished out from the ""queen"" of the spring classics known as the Hell of the North. If it's not the throat choaking dust, it's the face caked with mud from the rains along with the soul splitting Roman placed cobbled country roads that tests these gladiators of the road's mettle. This race is nearly always a battle of wills of the finest riders each team can field. If the men don't break, their machines could. A combination of skill and luck is what it takes to bring a hardened champion to the velodrome in Roubaix. Even if you aren't a rabid cycling fan, you will get hooked by the shear brutallity, grace and drive of Paris-Roubaix!",1394668800,,776,4.589928057553957
