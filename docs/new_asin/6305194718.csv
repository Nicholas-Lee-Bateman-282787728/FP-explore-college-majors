980163,5,6305194718,"this simple, yet elegant series of movements was designed to bring awareness to the breath and the movement of the body.
the video is divided into two segments: the first lead by a monk, brother michael. this part teaches the simple movements and coordination of the movements with the breath.
the second segment is the series lead by thich nhat hanh and the monks and nuns of the plum village community. what a gift to be able to practice with them!
i have used this video upon awakening in the morning as a gentle way to begin my day. i truly love it and look forward to every experience with it.",1036800000,37,598,4.396396396396397

7884661,4,6305194718,"For some reason I thought this was a dvd but it is really a tape. I don't have a tape player, so will just give it away to someone who has a tape player. I hope this is in dvd format",1368057600,,182,3.4634146341463414
7884662,5,6305194718,"Very focused, very gentle, very calm. I have recommended this to several people.
Thank you to Thich Naht Hanh for this.",1367020800,,119,4.714285714285714
7884663,2,6305194718,I actually took some time to read past reviews on this DVD and thought it was what I was looking for.. but it wasnt. Its only 30 minutes long. There is one set of movements an English teacher talks through and then Thich Nhat Hanh talks through the same set of movements. Then its over! I was under the impression Thich Nhat Hanh spoke more on Buddhism but aside from a few sentences he did not. You need to mute the sound in order to focus and relax to the exercise bc there is talking the whole time.,1305072000,3,502,4.13265306122449
7884664,5,6305194718,"I must assume if you are interested in this item, you are familiar with Thich Nhat Hanh and his Buddhist teachings.  I read almost all of his English publishing, but this is the first DVD on his teaching.  I consider the mindful movement exercises are just as important as his written words and verbal teaching.  It is a gem, but remember, I am part of the choir.",1296259200,4,363,4.388059701492537
7884665,5,6305194718,"This DVD is a great opportunity to practice with Hanh the monks and nuns of Plum Village. It is easy to follow and understand, a very simple and pleasant video.
I found myself very calm and relaxed (and a little tired!) after doing the excercises. It is a very interesting experience, and really gives tribute to Hanh's principle of engaged buddhism.",1248134400,8,350,4.754098360655738
7884666,4,6305194718,Received in a timely manner.  Thich Nhat Hanh's books and meditative movements are very helpful when dealing with the stress and trauma and sufferings of life.  I do not believe I could be as compassionate as he is after enduring what he endured.  He is an example of one to strive to be like in addition to Christ.,1241136000,2,315,4.396551724137931
7884667,3,6305194718,"The video was okay. The tree movement distracted rather than enhanced. Brother Michael was an excellent leader, although some of the other monks needed to be more mindful in following him.",1237680000,,188,5.096774193548387
