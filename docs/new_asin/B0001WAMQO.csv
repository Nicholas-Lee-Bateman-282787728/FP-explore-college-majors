2031631,3,B0001WAMQO,"this is basically two packages:
-lots of old cliche visuals done to generic hippytronica and whatever, forgettable
-new stunning generative visuals to deep exquisite audio, and chat about the project, super great, top marks

put together in a powerpoint-looking dvd menu

could seriously just lose all the old stuff, adds zero. more of the magic sheep stuff: and hooray for the author's transientness-of-competitive-things conceptualizing, but blah blah, just render these things every few weeks and make DVD compilations and I'll buy them.",1207353600,4,540,5.573170731707317
2031632,4,B0001WAMQO,"The reason gave this 4 stars is that I'm a photographer who wants to create animations of my own and this disc was very useful in showing me what is possible and what I like or don't like.  I found the 3 documentaries fascinating and well worth watching. The animations themselves tend to be a bit too repetitious for my taste, but it's an emerging artform. The potential is enormous.",1207008000,,384,4.485714285714286
2031633,1,B0001WAMQO,"Sold by all the five star reviews. I could not believe it started in black and in white normal TV square screen format. I can download better 'Kaleidoscope videos' for free, I wasted my time and money on something not worthy of my HD 65"" Toshiba TV. You can have my 'Spotworks' for $1 plus p&p.",1206576000,3,294,4.267857142857143
2031634,5,B0001WAMQO,"I thought that after a while I would get sick of this DVD - I've now played it far more than I expected to. However, it's not like that at all.

The reverse is true. The dance between visuals and sound just keeps getting better and better each time I play it.

One day it's diving into the exquisite visuals of a fractal journey that holds me captive. The next time it's the river of mood and moments, captured in audio and triggering a massage for the eardrums.

A beautiful, organic, sequence of digital life.

Is this a peek into the teeming world of a drop of water or am I observing images light years across?

Both seem apt.

Enjoy this journey. I still do.",1098921600,17,663,4.264
2031635,5,B0001WAMQO,"Admittedly I was in an induced ""receptive"" state of consciousness while viewing this DVD, but I don't think that condition invalidates my amazement with these motion graphics. Unlike most computer aided animation, these pieces feel like they could be timeless. As an animator myself, my impression of the first minute or so was cynical and critical and then I ""got it"". Whatever you get out of viewing this depends on how much attention you pay to the details it triggers in your imagination. If you patiently allow these visuals to unfold (because some are really slow), it can be like kinetic meditation.

Well worth the price and certainly worth supporting the hours of work it must have taken to create this art.",1092700800,13,716,4.868852459016393
2031636,5,B0001WAMQO,"simply put, scott draves is one of the best algorithmic/generative artists. while the fractal flame software is available for download, and you can make your own strange attractor renderings, owning this dvd saves you potentially thousands of hours of rendering time, it's from the artist himself, and it's all tied together with music and other work. with all of the hack job ""Art dvd""'s out there, this is one of the few truly original and groundbreaking pieces.",1088380800,13,464,5.038961038961039
2031637,5,B0001WAMQO,"I am amazed by the beauty of Spot's lifetime of work. I am especially awed by his artistic interpertation of the concept of evolution and how he has created a form of life from something we use everyday: machines. The computers ability to process information into a spirl of energy that can be manipulated by
someone, as Spot has done, expands our minds and our concept of the universe.",1081296000,8,386,4.608695652173913
8016804,3,B0001WAMQO,No better than having the current version of the Electric Sheep free screen saver.,1501286400,,82,4.928571428571429
8016805,5,B0001WAMQO,"This Visual DVD is very nice, the sound is somethimes a little bit weired and every video is not always amazing, however, it remains and excellent dvd.",1388361600,,151,4.62962962962963
8016806,1,B0001WAMQO,This video sucks.  The Graphics are not even proof of evolution.  Get winamp and play with the plug ins and then you will know what graphic visual evolution.  I am disappointed.,1298332800,,177,4.645161290322581
8016807,3,B0001WAMQO,"As a fan of the early 90s raves, I found this DVD to be much too modern looking to really resonate well with me.  The visuals seem to go best with dance music released after 1998 so they would go well with Drum & Bass and hard techno.  The pace of the graphics is fairly slow and relaxed.  I was however impressed that this DVD was made by the same people who wrote the ""Bomb"" rave graphics freeware that was designed for MS-DOS.  I ended up redownloading that software after seeing it on this DVD.  As a lover of the rough and ready style rave graphics I actually like the Bomb software better then the polished content on this DVD.",1296518400,,633,4.241666666666666
8016808,3,B0001WAMQO,"i already have electric sheep as my default screensaver on my macs, and i'm also a professional dj/vj, so i decided to try this out for possibly using in some of my sets. scott did a nice job and it's fine for background visuals, but it's not really more than what i already have for free with the electric sheep screensaver. the dvd is nicely produced, but i feel that it would be better priced at $9.99 vs. $16. other than that, it's fine for house parties or background visuals for clubs.",1256428800,,491,4.3478260869565215
8016809,5,B0001WAMQO,Exquisite imagery (how do they do it) and some very pleasing music - if with rather too much repetition. However you can use favourite discs to accompany the images so no problem there. To me this is a five star production.,1237766400,,223,4.463414634146342
8016810,4,B0001WAMQO,"1st off, this is not a movie. it is trippy visuals. i put this on at a party i went to. people were just looking at it like WOW. its ok but not for everyone",1234656000,,156,3.4857142857142858
8016811,2,B0001WAMQO,"This CD is childish.  No sophistication, a total disappointment.  Don't bother!  You can make this yourself!",1232582400,,108,5.625
8016812,5,B0001WAMQO,"I wanted something to add mood to my home and this DVD does just that.  The visuals are very soothing.  If you like kaleidoscopes, you'll like this.  I have a Phillips Ambilight TV so the colors glow onto the wall. Sometimes I have the music on low but usually I turn the TV volume all the way down.",1224633600,2,299,4.120689655172414
8016813,1,B0001WAMQO,"I'm not sure why this is ranked 4 stars, I bought and was instantly disappointed.  Music, so-so, but's okay because I was mostly interested in the video, which looked like something I could have made (not impressive).  In the end, I should have just purchased Ocean Origins (2002) on IMAX.... it's a way better mind trip and the video footage is superior.",1223769600,,355,4.709677419354839
