This DVD contains six episodes including the title ""Brewster Leads the Way""  Additional episodes include ""Babysitter Brewster,"" ""Brewster Meets The Mayor,"" ""Poor Old Puffer Pete,"" ""Old Puffer Pete's Firebox,"" and bonus Badge Quest adventure, ""Brewster's Carwash."" The title also contains a Chugger Spotlight segment with a special character montage that centers on Brewster, along with an original Chug Patrol: Ready to Rescue music video, and coloring and activity pages, too!

My boys love anything Chuggington, but my youngest has always said that Brewster was his favorite Chugger and after watching the Brewster Leads the Way DVD for the past few weeks, I can say that he is still his favorite chugger! He won't let me take the DVD out of my computer!  I had to burn a couple of pictures the other day and he heard the DVD player open - he was right beside me, holding the DVD, waiting for me to put it right back into the computer - and then wanted to immediately kick me off so he could watch it again!

Our favorite episode is Babysitter Brewster, where Brewster is put in charge of watching and teaching Hoot and Toot, which doesn't go very well... needless to say, my boys find this episode really funny.

I personally like that all of the Chuggington episodes have teachable moments and promote good values - in a way that is relatable and fun for my kids.  I know when I set them down with this DVD they will be entertained and learn something about relating to others in a whole new way!",1393977600,2,1562,4.63768115942029
