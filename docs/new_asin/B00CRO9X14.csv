8585338,5,B00CRO9X14,"Doctor Gonzales, a western trained medical doctor,  has wonderful and healing information to share with ALL who are suffering from the monster called CANCER.  This DVD gives us practical information that can heal the sick, and that very likely could have saved many from the horror of pancreatic cancer, who have died in spite of mainstream cancer treatments.  This information was presented and available in the early 1980s.  How sad that he and his collaborating colleague were both victims of a mysterious murder not long ago,... an obvious attempt to shut down the VERY Important research they were doing, and thus hushing their attempts to share with humankind proof of a natural way to save lives from cancer.  It is a HUGE LOSS for humankind. Instead of being able to utilize the vital information provided by these two wonderful medical doctors, our citizens are continuously solicited to help raise funds for the 'research' being done by the American Cancer Society, an ongoing activity for many decades now, with little if no help for the many, many who are suffering with cancer.  AGAIN,  a continuous and  HUGE LOSS for humankind.",1506816000,2,1142,5.005291005291006
8585339,5,B00CRO9X14,"This video is a review of several of Dr. Gonzalez's successful patients. It will inspire those involved in fighting cancer to look for successful protocols beyond the highly unsuccessful treatments by chemo, radiation and surgery. Why? Because this protocol, unlike radiation and chemo, works without adding to the disease. Read the label on any bottle of your Oncologist's chemo. It says, ""Warning: Causes Cancer"".
For insight as to how this protocol works and is used, I strongly recommend you get the other two videos, "" Enzymes and Cancer"" and ""Different Diets for Different Types"" by Dr. Gonzalez. For more technical reading, I suggest you read, ""The Trophoblast and the Origins of Cancer: One solution to the medical enigma of our times"" although this is lightly covered in some of the DVDs. I am twice a cancer caregiver and once a survivor using Dr. Gonzalez's recommendations. I hope you are as successful as I was!",1467849600,19,924,5.0064935064935066
