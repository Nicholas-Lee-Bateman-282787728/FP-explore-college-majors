5180364,5,B008RYMZXG,"Dr. Tim LaHaye and others again show us the significance and importance of studying Biblical prophecy in our own personal lives. These informative programs are great for both personal and classroom use. You don't need to be a fan of ""Left Behind"" to appreciate LaHaye's insights which of course comes from his great knowledge of the Sacred Texts. With Bible and notebook in hand, I am very pleased with the quality of this set of DVDS.",1394064000,5,435,4.7368421052631575
