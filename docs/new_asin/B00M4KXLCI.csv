6557296,5,B00M4KXLCI,Just a response to all thus far.  If it is typical then why but the first seasons when it would be expected that a complete series would come?,1412985600,3,142,4.071428571428571
6557297,2,B00M4KXLCI,"Great TV show. But look's like Mill missed it here.
No CC are SDH for the hard of Hearing?
Why not?",1412294400,7,99,3.761904761904762
6557298,3,B00M4KXLCI,I can not believe this I faithfully buy seasons 1 to 4 and am waiting for the announcement of season 5.  Instead they put out the complete series all together.  I am not double dipping just to get season 5.  Hopefully they will be putting season 5 out seperately in the near future,1406764800,4,281,4.264150943396227
6557299,5,B00M4KXLCI,"Hate that they do this. I buy all the individual season sets then along comes the complete series which I would rather have as it takes up less room on my shelf..What a bummer and to resell the season sets is useless anymore since they are worth about a dollar ....These studios suck  Cant they release all the old shows at one time in COMPLETE SERIES versions or for the lesser true fans,  Season sets..They are doing this with Starsky and Hutch and Facts of Life too...",1406678400,4,471,4.402298850574713
6557300,5,B00M4KXLCI,"This has got to be one of the best shows ever. Every episode is interesting and good. Michael Landon and Victor French are very good in it. They don't make shows like they used to, and Highway to Heaven is one of the best. It was made in the 1980's and is totally a classic. It is way better than 99% of today's shows. Highly recommended.",1525392000,,338,4.136363636363637

6557302,2,B00M4KXLCI,Every other disc skips terribly. Would have done better buying them one at a time. Also they came in a light box...to flimsy to hold the discs securely. It is little house though...good family show.,1524096000,,198,4.685714285714286

6557306,5,B00M4KXLCI,"There are no closed-captioning, subtitles, on my ""Highway to Heaven"" dvd. To inform you, I am fully Deaf... I am disappointed, because I love the clean, good, great show that teaches life points of hope and goodness. Excellent for all ages. I bought it for my family to keep as our wholesome go-to TV show, but I need captions. I do appreciate the making of the DVD series much (learned about the show from Netflix). It is a rare kind of TV show that should be popular. Hopefully it will make a comeback. It is our favorite of all-time, and we are young people, so it's not an oldy show. It teaches important issues. While being comical.",1523145600,3,637,4.452991452991453

6557322,2,B00M4KXLCI,"I bought this for my deaf mother thinking since Netflix had the option for impaired hearing that the DVD would,  it did not.

6557324,5,B00M4KXLCI,"Fun series to watch with my family.  Always good food for thought & discussion in teaching values so lacking in most modern shows. This is from 1970's or 80's, so don't expect an HD quality, and it is formatted for older 'square' sizing. Entertaining & humorous, in Michael Lando style ( Little House on Prairie -- another great series).",1510531200,,337,4.711864406779661

6557337,5,B00M4KXLCI,"I have always loved this show and watch it years ago. People show up to save a persons life in a car accident, fire, almost drowning, or someone wanting to  jump off a bridge. The one thing all of us would like to know is what is on the other side of death in Heaven? The Bible tells us about heaven and a few say they been there but never went in. It makes the sadness and heartbreak,of this life easier to except that we are going to a better and peaceful place. Michael now has made that journey and went on The Highway to Heaven and has himself found peace. Thank you Michael for a job well done.",1502150400,3,600,4.042016806722689

6557376,3,B00M4KXLCI,"I was very impressed and enjoyed the first two episodes of Season 1, written and directed by Michael Landon himself. They were clearly 5-star shows. Unfortunately, the quality of the script was not maintained. Some episodes were awfully sophomoric, others plain boring. Occasionally, a good episode would appear--but typically sandwiched between mediocre ones. I watched the 17 first episodes of Season 1, but I finally decided that there were potentially better offerings to occupy my time. 3 stars",1480550400,,499,5.410256410256411

6557378,4,B00M4KXLCI,"Considering this is the complete series, the price point can't be beat... but I've never seen worse packaging when it comes to DVD's...  EVER!  I've put trash in thicker envelopes than what each DVD is packaged in AND STACKED so you have a 3"" pile of super-thin eveleopes stuffed into what looks like a normal DVD box.  The episodes are clean enough, and, in fact, there were several episodes that haven't seen the light of day since their original air dates -- while some of the topics are dated and a little hokie, many of the messages still hold up today... like we've come to expect from Michael Landon Productions.  In fact, the final episode in the series discusses what are now called GMO's, the water crisis, and the general pollution of the lands thanks to greed.  Michael Landon and Victor French continue their Bro-Mance, and work seamlessly together... and I just love it... but the boxed set designer should be ashamed of themselves, and refund ANY money they made when they considered the packaging to be acceptable to diehard fans.  Ultimately, $20 or so is all this package is worth... if only for the memory of Landon and French -- they were, and still are, awesome.",1479772800,,1183,4.690821256038648

6557398,5,B00M4KXLCI,"Michael plays essentially the same fatherly guardian type of character as in the Little House series.. Even Victor French's character bears a lot of resemblance to the Mr Edwards personality of the aforementioned..

I didn't get much of a chance to watch these as a child but I will like to now.. I'm also furthering my Little House collection and hopefully one day I'll have all the episodes!

The irony in that many say to appreciate Landon in his work you have to be religious or a strict Christian person.. That's not the case at all as I am far from it.. The emphasis is more on character building, morals and values with elements of humor thrown in as well.. He was a genius with all he did in his relatively short tragic albeit wonderful majestic life..",1471651200,2,760,4.54014598540146

6557411,5,B00M4KXLCI,Great series.  Those here who are judging it for not being biblically correct need to get a life !  It was fiction and make believe like most things in Hollywood.  I didn't get the impression Michael was trying to mislead people!  Didn't think he was trying to teach good works to ho to heaven.  In fact one episode even States that you can't buy your way to heaven.  These are great moral stories.  As far as angels...I believe angels can he human form too.  Bible speaks of it!  There are some cuss words but the stories are so sweet and morally correct that its easy to overlook a few flaws it has !  A great and clean show by the great Michael Landon.  Some of his finest acting and work.  One of the greatest and most underrated series of all tim .  God bless Michael lando .  Love and miss him!!!!,1468022400,,803,4.231788079470198

6557414,5,B00M4KXLCI,"I have always loved Michael Landon but never watched this show because I got the impression that it was some kind of religious 'praise G-d or go to hell' kind of show but the price was right so I thought I'd check it out.

I have never been so wrong or loved a series so much. Michael Landon plays an angel (who soon gets a partner in Victor French). These two go around place to place, as G-d instructs them what to do, saving or helping or doing something to or with someone who needs their help.

The stories are self contained and don't run on and on into the next tape and the next. One of the reasons I loved it so much was I could watch a couple of shows and when I continued each was a story unto itself with a beginning and an ending and -- oh yes -- a lot of tears from my end. I should own Kleenex!

This is a really beautiful series with each heart-wrenching story that somehow G-d through his angel (and Victor who is not an angel) helps these people live a better life in one form or another. G-d gives them 'assignments'  through Michael  and tells him where to go and what he needs to do.

Victor was introduced during one of the story lines and he really had  nothing going on  in his life. He got along so well with 'the angel' that they became friends and he became the angel's sidekick. They had a wonderful chemistry and were a joy to see.

This is truly a family oriented show. Each is touching (thus the Kleenex); some have a message, though subtle but all in all the entire show is just precious and I am so happy I gave it a chance--I know you will too.",1467676800,3,1578,4.097402597402597

6557420,2,B00M4KXLCI,"It's a ""hit and a miss""...a hit show when it was on, but a miss when it comes to leading you to the truth that matters.

Many things are alarming about this show. I don't remember there being so much swearing when this show was on NBC, but here you would be hard pressed to find an episode without the ""d"" word and the ""h"" word they use ad nauseum! Most disturbing is how they seemingly joke about using the Lord's name in vain, but they do it all the time...

You will find no sound doctrine in this series. What it lacks in Biblical truth it overflows with humanism... It treats God as a generic ""boss"" and never points to Jesus Christ as the only way to God, which is Biblical truth. Michael Landon had a chance to really point people to this truth but instead pointed them to the errant teaching that all good people go to heaven and only bad people go to hell. Actually this show seemed to think nobody would go to hell. And their view of the devil was completely in error. Satan is not in hell, nor does he rule there. He will be there someday but not to rule, no be eternally punished. What is the truth about heaven? Believers on Christ and who He was,is, and will alway be who believe in Him as their Saviour are in heaven as are little children who die before the age of reason and people who aren't able to ever reach the age of reason. Good or bad has nothing to do with it. Christ is the only bridge to God the Father and to heaven. I wish this show had taught that instead of a lot of sappy stuff that sounds good, but is untrue. Angels are created beings just like humans are...But angels were never human and humans never ""turn into"" angels. This fallacy has been around for a long time (Frank Capra's ""angel"" Clarence Oddbody from Its a Wonderful Life for example was a dead human who was working up the ranks of angeldom to earn his wings)....

Though you might like to think Granny is your personal guardian angel since she died, truth is, she isn't and she never will be. Yes God uses angels for many reasons, they have always been angels. They were never human. The angels who rebelled with Lucifer (himself once a very high ranking beautiful angel) were thrown out of heaven with him and are now what we call demons. And no they don't reside in hell yet either...but they will one day.

If you want to spend some time being entertained, and don't mind swearing and unsound doctrine, then maybe you will like this.

But please consider that Jesus loves you and He died for you so you could be with Him in heaven one day. That is the truth that will last forever. This series will only fade away into nothing, as all earthly things shall one day.

Do you just want to be entertained, or do you want to know God's true Love forever?
Please choose.....He loves you, beloved...",1464134400,6,2794,4.292220113851992

Michael Landon & Victor French performed beautifully with grace and left us a wonderful legacy. The first couple of episodes of season 2 took a detour when those ""people"" try to take over his show because of the content. But because there is a GOD, the stuido gave it back to him. And because of this we should all feel blessed.  I do remember watching one episode when I come across it the other day.

I surrender my life to Jesus in 1993 while I was traveling in West Virginia through a small town one day. Not because of the show. But because of the time in my life where I felt hopelessly alone. There is a big difference in feeling lonely than there is feeling alone. And because of that day, I've learned the difference between the two.

I now believe in my heart that because of that one episode  GOD was calling me to become one of his children.

I'm 50 years old now and I still travel.
I am still lonely.

But I will never be ""ALONE"" again.

6557511,5,B00M4KXLCI,"Not sure there are really too many legitimate complaints when we are getting the whole series so cheap!

While these don't bother me at all, it is important to know the following:
 - You are just getting the episodes and no extra features. (Well, there is a short blooper reel at the end of one of the seasons.)
 - The packaging is, I would say, efficient with no frills. All 23 discs come in one DVD case that is about 2 inches thick, and each disc is in a paper sleeve. Totally works, just no special or fancy packaging. (I actually like this because it takes up very little storage space relative to other individually packaged series.)

As for the show itself, it's still a good show for kids and adults. I am not particularly religious; but I find this show to be more about hope and humanity than it is about preachiness. I'm too young to have watched it during most of its run and even though the episodes are clearly dated, I still find it entertaining.  (Plus, it's fun to see all of the guest stars, many of whom went on to become bigger stars.)",1435622400,12,1055,4.33502538071066

6557569,5,B00M4KXLCI,"Aside from the 80's caliber acting of occasional societal stereotypes and caricatures, Highway to Heaven is undoubtedly a series meant for those who wish for our world the deepest desires of the human spirit for faith, hope and love for all. A few episodes may be a bit too contrived for their own good, yet on the whole there's not another series that at the end of the day I watch to refocus my aspirations for what's important in life. I look at this series as Michael Landon's genuine attempt at modeling the mercy and compassion of God to our broken humanity. It deserves tremendous respect for its character especially in the context of what many TV series have devoted their energies to in the past 15 years (mind-numbing gratuitous sex and violence in just about any plot or character imaginable).

I must disclose that my five-star rating is in part because it was my mom's favorite that I would watch with her on Sunday afternoons when I was a boy. Her life was cut short when I was 21 and so this series is a very real way that I connect to her spirit and the life that I'm trying to live today.",1423526400,2,1106,4.421568627450981
6557570,4,B00M4KXLCI,It is classic Michael Landon. I have all the little house on the prairie dvds. I am glad they came out with all 5 seasons in one set. I am enjoying watching them. Definitely 80's tv show.,1423353600,,187,4.081081081081081

6557572,4,B00M4KXLCI,"I had never watched that show when it originally aired, but brought it on the recommendation of a friend. I'm giving it four stars only because the video quality isn't up to Standard for digitally remastered DVDs, not because of the content.
  The stories are heartwarming about an angel on assignment to help someone who is disadvantage or hurting. HOWEVER, in typical Hollywood fashion the theology is flawed. Case in point is season one episode 18 where the minister in conclusion says that people can still go to heaven by being good even though They don't have faith in God. This is the exact opposite of what the Bible says. Hebrews 11:6, Acts 16:31, Ephesians 2:8-9, and Titus 3:5 are some of many examples.
  If you like stories where the good guys win, and don't mind them not being digitally remastered, you will enjoy these.the price at $24.95 is a  real bargain. I also saw them at SAMs Club for $29.95.",1423353600,5,915,4.658385093167702
6557573,5,B00M4KXLCI,"This has the entire five seasons of the series in one box.  This is a great series that shows how an angel and an ex-cop go around the country helping people in need, lost and suffering back toward a right relationship with God and in the process they learn things about themselves and each other that help them in their assignments.  The stars are Michael Landon as Jonathan Smith (which in the pilot he says ""is no joke"") and Victor French as Mark Gordon.  There are great guest stars in each episode Jonathan Frakes, Kellie Martin, Ned Beauty, Lew Ayres, Helen Hunt, Lorne Greene, Ed Asner, Eli Wallach, Shannen Doherty, Ernest Borgnine, Didi Conn, Dick Van Dyke, James Earl Jones, Leslie Nielson, Bob Hope, Richard Bull, Matthew Laborteaux and many others.  The show even talks about difficult sujects like drugs, pregnancy, wealthy exploiting the poor, pollution, waste contamination, disability and its affect on the person and society as a whole, disease, peer pressure, Special Olympics for the mentally challenged, divorce, marriage, love and many others.

6557597,5,B00M4KXLCI,What a fantastic price for all the 46 plus minute episodes 111 of them with some extras . Michael Landon and Victor French both  outdid themselves with this series . Every show teaches life lessons and is suitable for all ages . The perfect show for family tv night . Do up a little popcorn or fruit and cheese slices and enjoy . Clean shows no worries though some may entertain subjects that are difficult for even adults to ponder though  they are suitable for all ages . Important values are taught through often heartwarming story plots based on Christian beliefs as you follow Angel Johnathon along his travels with his friend Marc . This is tv the way it was meant to be . Shows after the first year are edited for TV time slots but absolutely wonderful . Even non Christians should find the story plots enjoyable and heartwarming .,1419033600,,838,4.506578947368421

6557611,5,B00M4KXLCI,"I missed this show when it was aired.  I was young and working second shift. I was also not following the right path.

I am nearing sixty years of age and often wonder how I got this far.  The very first episode was so ""right on"" it gave me a good feeling.  Yeah, I bet you thought I would say it gave me chills.  It was so about my life that I bet it is also about most of your lives.

One hundred and eleven episodes is going to take a whole to watch but I know that each an every one will be educational.

To those that think you were cheated.  Watch this show again!  You have not been cheated.",1416614400,40,598,3.87603305785124

6557615,3,B00M4KXLCI,"UPDATE [9/1/15]:
After taking time to watch this entire collection, I have to rate it much lower...Giving it 3 stars is still very generous. As I said before, the video transfer is quite grainy and now, having listened to the sound more closely, I find the audio quality really bad. There are many glitches, ticks, and faded sound occurrences. Also, only a couple of the disks (I believe in season 3) are in stereo. Very sad! I don't believe I will ever purchase another product made by Millcreek or MILLCreekDirect(dot)com

I still believe this is a great series completely destroyed by MillCreek with this DVD rendering.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I was torn between giving this (5 star series) DVD collection a 3 star or 4 star rating because there are no subtitles or even closed-caption stream. This is really unacceptable in today's age. Also, for a show about spirituality, they really should have at least included the CC stream which is even subsidized by government agencies. Sure, this stream is only accessible through the AV (audio/video - red, white and yellow) connection where it should be included for (now CC required) TVs to decipher. I have a deaf member of my household and this is really sad that he cannot enjoy these stories with me without physical interpretation. This greatly lessens the total fulfillment of watching these wonderful stories.

Anyway, now that my disquietude has subsided, I will tell you about this series...It is heartwarming, inspirational stories of gratitude, loss, equal rights and many other real life situations. It takes these situations to a Higher level with Jonathan (Michael Landon) as an angel working with his mortal counterpart, Mark, to assist the ""Boss"" (God?) with many untoward circumstances and those who are affected and guide them through their various life altering events. Mark and Jonathon don't always agree and there are some instances of defiance by all. Overall, the ""right"" conclusion is achieved whether it be a (mostly) happy or a sad, immutable ending. I find these stories to be sensitive with some humor and many times enlightening.

I didn't watch this series when it was first aired because I was probably partying too much. I began to catch the reruns on A&E and really got into the stories. This is also true for me for the Touched by an Angel series. I never really got into Little House on the Prairie series though.

As for the content and quality of this entire DVD collection, I give the shows 5 stars, 3 stars for the packaging, 3 stars for the video transfer (a bit grainy - I don't believe Mill Creek got the masters for DVD transfer) and 1 star for lack of closed-captioning. Okay, I'll also give it 4 stars for having the complete series nicely together in a compact DVD collection.

Overall, whether you are a hard-core (er, soft-core here) fan or, like me, just realizing these excellent stories and even direction of these shows, this is a very nice DVD set to have in your collection. These stories are and will always be adorning as well as uplifting to the heart, mind and spirit.",1415836800,27,3071,4.828897338403042
6557616,4,B00M4KXLCI,"Lets ease the minds of those who had questions:

1. ""Are the episodes unedited?"" Yes-the A & E DVDs have the syndicated cuts are 45 Min. The Mill Creek ones are 49-50 minutes.

Update: Sorry to be the bearer of bad news--but after the first season-the episodes are edited--you will see a run time anywhere from 45 minutes to 48-minutes. I'm now into the 4th season-they are edited too.

2. ""What about the case?"" Well the packaging wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. The discs are NOT on a spindle-but are in individual paper sleeves.

3. ""How is the Picture quality?"" Again not as bad as I thought--The picture quality is just as good as the A & E ones.

Conclusion: No matter how you look at it-you are getting the best bang for the buck. No special features-just the episodes-that's all I want. I'm happy-I now have every episode. I never expected any more than this!

Update--Because of the run times, it saddens me to inform readers that I reduced my 5 star rating to 4 stars. However, I'm glad to see these on DVD--ESP the last two seasons which until now haven't been available--we have Mill creek to thank for that. I'm just happy to have them all-if even it is not perfect.",1415664000,77,1194,4.404545454545454

8670271,3,B00M4KXLCI,"Highway to Heaven is typical of family entertainment during the 1980s. Michael Landon not only stars in the series, but also produced it.

This set includes all the episodes from all five seasons. However, there are some caveats that may or may not influence your purchasing decision.
* There are up to five episodes per disc.
* Only one extra is included -- bloopers at the end of the first season.
* There are no subtitles or captions.
* Color density is somewhat inconsistent, going from washed out to some saturation.
* Contrast is also inconsistent, going from clean and sharp to being washed out (blacks are not black, but noticeably gray). This sometimes happens within an episode.
* Silk-screen printing is not always consistent from disc to disc within a season. This doesn't affect the shows, but it is an indication that there was little quality control in preparing and producing the series.
* Discs are stored in double-sided cardboard sleeves, which does an excellent job of protecting them from scratches.

Generally speaking, the shows are okay, and feature a wide variety of guest performers, some of which are famous in their own right.

The music by David Rose has never impressed me and doesn't really add to the show. If anything, it gets annoying, something that I remember from watching this show with my family.

There are a significant number of two-part episodes, but they are always on the same disc. I haven't checked to see if their appearance on the same disc is coincidental with the order in which the shows were broadcast, or if placing them together on the same disc was on purpose. -- It really doesn't matter, but is worth mentioning.

Disc production quality is really on worth two stars. The shows were and continue to be dragged down by the music and rank only three stars, which is what I gave the overall package.",1532649600,,1854,4.7632398753894085
