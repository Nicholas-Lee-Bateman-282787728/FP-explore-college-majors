3901552,3,B002BYYA4K,"My 6-year watched all the 2nd generation Strawberry Shortcake cartoons and movies for the last couple of years. This one does make a departure from the old series, but my girl still liked it enough to want to watch it more than once. I admit I preferred the previous series too like the other reviewers, but it's not meant for daddy; it's meant for daddy's girl.",1265500800,,362,4.5
3901553,5,B002BYYA4K,My 4 year old and I have been Strawberry Shortcake fans for quite some time.  We really loved the Strawberry from Cooking Up Fun and Sea berry Beach party.  We were Just getting used to the makeover when yet another revamp occurred. I was hesitant since Sky's the Limit is so different but we have enjoyed it just fine.  My little girl still loves it and with more toys available she seems to enjoy it more.  We have watched this movie over and over.  It seems to go back to Strawberry's roots from when I was a little girl.  The original characters with a modern flair.  When I was young She talked to the sun and if I am not mistaken she was small like the characters in the new movie. Even though she has been through a lot of changes I hope Strawberry will stay around for a long time.  She is such a wonderful little girl and toy for kids to play with.  I hope They continue the movie series and it is fine with me if they stick with the new style.,1265328000,4,953,4.108108108108108
3901554,5,B002BYYA4K,"My daughters love this movie, and everything Strawberry Shortcake. It is a bit shallow, and not much to the plot, but enjoyable for a kid. They watch it all the time.",1264550400,2,166,4.387096774193548
3901555,5,B002BYYA4K,"This is a little different than other Strawberry Shortcake movies it is 3-D.  My girls love the movie, ages 12, 19, and 22.  The 12 year old is the biggest fan.  She wanted it for her SS movie collection.",1263600000,2,204,4.17948717948718
3901556,1,B002BYYA4K,My 4.5 years old daughter got scared by the story line. We had to turn it off after 10-15 minutes and told her she would watch it when she grows up some more. I think this re-invention also changed the target group to older girls but I wish they can change more gradually. I would be careful with this and next DVDs.,1261180800,2,316,4.112903225806452
3901557,4,B002BYYA4K,"We enjoyed this movie and loved the new look for Strawberry Shortcake.  She and her friends are so pretty and more realistic too.  I wasn't paying a lot of attention to the plot ... trying to get work done while my 4 yr old watched ... but my 4 year old liked it a lot, as she has all of the other Strawberry Shortcake movies.  I am buying another copy for my niece for Christmas.",1260748800,,380,4.04
3901558,1,B002BYYA4K,"I was expecting a smiliar format to the other Strawberry Shortcake movies, but it is not. I don't mind the makeover she's had, but this movie was not as cheery and fun as previous. There are FEW songs in it, just a lot of talking which is not fun for smaller kids...My daughter, who loves Strawberry Shortcake, was not excited baout this movie as she is with the other ones. I would not spend 14.99 on this movie. instead, use that money and go buy the other, older Straberry Shortcake movies to enjoy! Some of my daughter's favorites include: Adventures on Ice Cream Island, The Best pets Yet, and Big Country Fun.",1258588800,10,615,4.5
3901559,2,B002BYYA4K,"Yet another reboot for Strawberry, and this time it's an epic failure. My 4-year-old has been a HUGE SS fan for the past year, even had her birthday party with a SS theme last year. ""Big Country Fun"" is one of her favorites, and we really like the ""Journey"" movie as well. We own all of the DVDs and watch them often.

Unfortunately, we really could not get through this newest reinvention. We tried on three occasions to watch credits to credits and failed every time. There are characters missing--Honey Pie Pony is a favorite that's now MIA--and the animation/digitization is awful. And it's SO boring! After three attempts, I still have no idea what the movie was about. With the older movies, the characters seems like real people functioning in their real little world, but the new characters are just alien. It's strange and my DD is really upset. She doesn't have any interest in the toys at all already has told me that if another movie comes out, she doesn't want to watch it.",1256515200,11,986,4.6022727272727275
3901560,2,B002BYYA4K,"I must admit I'm a big fan of the former version of Strawberry Shortcake and was very leary when I heard they were re-inventing her. But I tried very hard to go into watching this movie with an open mind hoping I would be proven wrong. Unfortunately, I wasn't. Even if you can adjust to the new look (which isn't all that bad and not quite as grown up as I was thinking it would be), the storyline and characters are unimaginative and boring. You definitely don't get the feeling each girl is her own unique individual with quirks and character like the former Strawberry Shortcake gang was. My huge Strawberry Shortcake fan who is almost 4 years old, quit watching the movie mid way through. She was bored. I fell asleep. Missing are classic characters such as Honey Pie Pony, Ginger Snap, Angel Cake, and Huckleberry Pie to name a few. There's odd caterpillar and berrykin characters who just add a strange element to the whole mess. And then there's the uninspired world in which they live. Instead of imaginative places like Ice Cream Island, Cake Walk, the River Fudge, and Cookie Corners, you get a very unimaginative world that looks too much like reality . . . just a bunch of rocks and bushes. And Strawberry and her pals are miniature now . . . living down under the bushes. So to sum it up, don't waste your money or time on this particular movie. And if the first movie is any indication of what's to come, my daughter and I will be sticking with our collection of past Strawberry Shortcake DVDs.",1254441600,24,1508,4.507299270072993
3901561,5,B002BYYA4K,"Complete with triple A car safety and Strawberry Shortcake toy line commercials the newest Strawberry Shortcake movie has given Strawberry her newest and cutest make over yet. Strawberry and friends are now bug size instead of the human size she seem to be in either the classic 1970s series or the latest Koolopolis series on Saturday Morning. Strawberry and friends live in Berry Bity City that powered by berry juice. When a rock block the water source that power juice factory and might force them to make a new town near a new water source, the girls learn the meaning of team work and dealing with their own mistakes in the sweet movie. Strawberry's cat Custard meowing like the original series instead of talking like the newer version.",1252972800,4,743,4.8125

3901586,5,B002BYYA4K,"I ordered this movie at the request of my 4 year old daughter.  She has 2 other SS (Strawberry Shortcake) DVD's and saw this one advertised on one of them.  So being the wonderful mom I am I got on here and found her the DVD she wanted.  The item arrived in stellar condition and played perfectly the first time.  She has asked to watch it repeatedly.  I really like the 3D SS cartoons and the new story lines they are much better than when I was a kid.  This 40 year old mom even enjoys watching the DVD's with her. We were very pleased with the vibrant colors as well as the storyline.  Highly suggest for any girl between 2 1/2 and 6 as well as those who like SS.

3901663,3,B002BYYA4K,My girls loved the other videos - but this one - well - had much to be desired.  Strawberry and her friends basically risk their lives because they are following what the Caterpillar is saying (to save Berry Bitty City) and it turns out all along he is lying to make himself look good.

We DVR them on HUB and are getting all of the DVD's since we love them so much (and so I can clear the DVR). I grew up on Strawberry Shortcake and passed my old toys on to her. No, it's not the exact same thing as the old ones but I think it was improved to be more relevant. There are no bad guys and the shows deal with friendship, citizenship, dreams/ talents, & character. There are great lessons and it is soooooo much better than some of the other kiddie shows! The Characters all have their separate talents and strengths and each is valuable to make the best community. In addition, my 4 and 6 year old nieces love these shows too. HANDS DOWN-- We LOVE what Hasbro and Hub have done here and I hope others will too. :)",1327017600,11,857,4.257668711656442

3901741,4,B002BYYA4K,"Strawberry Shortcake and her friends are in danger of having to leave Berry Bitty City when a huge (to them) rock has cut off their water supply.  When their caterpillar friend, Mr. Longface, tells them about a mythical stone that can bring the water back, the gang goes off on an adventure to find the stone so they can save their town.

This movie is way more action/adventure than sing-a-long and would probably be more entertaining to older kids over toddlers.  These character models are definitely more ""tween-ish"" in their actions and attitudes, the most ""grown up"" SSC to date.  However, the material in this movie is appropriate for all ages.  This is a full length movie, the other videos in the series are individual stories in similar theme, most of which can be seen on the SSC show currently airing on The Hub.

In this movie, starring the rebooted Strawberry Shortcake characters, we find the gang living in ""Berry Bitty City"", a miniature city within the confines of the real world, more akin to the 1980s SSC versus the 2003 SSC.  I personally find this new version of the characters to be much more cute and hip and WAY less whiny and annoying than the characters in the 2003 cartoons.  I like that they are focusing on a core group of characters (Strawberry Shortcake, Lemon Meringue, Orange Blossom, Raspberry Torte, Plum Pudding, Blueberry Muffin plus a few Berrykins and Mr. Longface the caterpillar) versus new characters added every other episode like in the 2003 version with dumber and dumber names (Banana Candy? Really?)  At least with fewer characters, my child is able to ""get to know"" the girls and is able to identify their individual personalities and flaws.

Speaking of which, this reboot is not without its flaws.  It seems like this group can't function unless Strawberry Shortcake herself is around to be the voice of reason.  The girls act very much like ""tweens"", this is more evident in other videos such as ""Puttin' on the Glitz"" and ""Berryfest Princess"".  That being said, the girls are true friends, support each other and the principles in the videos are good ones: friendship, honesty and trying your best.",1322611200,2,2152,4.831062670299728

3901746,5,B002BYYA4K,"I am no Strawberry Shortcake purist, so my review will be lacking the declarations of the previous reviewers.

I think this is a sweet and cute story. Strawberry and her friends have to save their city from a natural disaster, a boulder that falls during a storm and blocks Itty Bitty City's water supply.

The show is about the friends' journey to try and save their town. They band together and make several attempts before getting the job done.

My son, yes... I said son, loves this whole series. He just turned 4 and had his own Strawberry Shortcake party, complete with the movies and toys. He tells me why he likes each girl and what their specialties are. He sees them as fun and sweet.

I say keep the new Strawberry and friends. I say its time to leave the ol' Holly Hobby looking one behind!",1295222400,3,802,4.4353741496598635
3901747,5,B002BYYA4K,"I discovered Strawberry Shortcake with my 4 year old daughter and she has watched the movie almost every night for a week. It's no the most fantastic movie ever made, true. But Strawberry and her friends finally look up to date and yet maintain a sweet innocence that childrens show characters should have. I grew up with the original in the 80's and I think the core theme is still a part of the new Strawberry, but shes more up to date for today.

There is no bad guy in this story, you soon learn a big rock has blocked the river that runs through Berry Bitty City. Strawberry and her friends along with their friend Mr. Longface Caterpillar set out on a journey to find the ""Great Geyser Stone"" and save the city. There are many twists and turns along the way but in the end everyone has to work together. It's a sweet story for kids and refreshing to not have the typical ""bad guy causes every problem"" issue.

Overall as a childhood fan and now parent I 100% approve of the new Strawberry Shortcake.",1292803200,,1005,4.3689839572192515
3901748,1,B002BYYA4K,"I have to start off by saying my kids and I did not make it all the way through this movie. That alone is a huge sign because all three of my kids (even my four year old son)love Strawberry Shortcake. I grew up playing with the original version way back in the day and my oldest daughter started out with what was to be the first version of the new Strawberry. We all loved these movies and the toys as well.

The movies were very sweet and upbeat with very likable characters for the most part. Then not too long after they changed strawberry and ""updated"" her again. I must say it annoyed me a tad that they felt the need to change the characters looks because I actually liked the fact that they actually looked like kids. The newer version was a tad bit older looking,  maybe tween looking you could say. However thankfully the voices and the storylines for the most part remained the same. Still lots of catchy sweet songs and all our favorite characters with some new ones thrown in. All three of my kids easily adapted to the new Strawberry and loved them both.

So today with much anticipation we began to watch this movie. It was very clear from the beginning that this was not going to be what we were used to. I kept an open mind and kept watching. Sadly it just kept going downhill. The first really strange thing were the little berry creatures. They really made no sense and were sort of creepy I think. Then we noticed Custard the cat wasn't talking which I didn't mind because I find that character beyond annoying. My kids noticed this right off the bat though and didn't like this change. Then it was obvious that Strawberry and all her friends not only looked different, they sounded different as well.

Gone are all of the girls' distinct personalities and quirks. Now the girls just sort of look and sound like teenage versions of their former selves...well except they left their personalities behind. They all just sort of have what I would call whiny mall rat type voices, very generic.

The storyline was confusing to me at best. I guess I was just so thrown off by all the differences that I wasn't paying enough attention maybe? One thing I can tell you is that as far as we made it through the movie there weren't any songs but I have read on here that there are actually a few which I would like to hear but I would imagine they aren't great.

I guess I think they should have just left Strawberry and her friends alone. I'm not exactly sure the demographic they are looking for now but it's an older one for sure. The thing is I really don't see older girls getting into this and it's too boring for most young girls. I don't mind Strawberry's new look really because it is cute. However like I said before it was a breath of fresh air when the first new Strawberry came out to have a little girl character looking sweet and normal in a shirt and jeans. I don't see why they have to always sort of give everything the bratz doll treatment. Yes the new version is cute but I just don't know why all the little girls characters have to always be so glammed up?

I would give this zero stars if I could. I don't think it says much for this character when they retool it three times in just a few years. I feel like they are taking a great character and running it into the ground. If you are already a fan then rent this one and give it a shot but don't go in expecting much and keep hold of your older Strawberry DVD's.",1291593600,,3447,4.293846153846154
3901749,5,B002BYYA4K,"I am 32 years old so I remember the Strawberry Shortcake of yester-year.  :-)  I like the new and updated version so much better.  This movie is absolutely adorable.  My daughter is a very sensitive 3 year old, and this movie is so appropriate in every way.  It has a sweet message, a good plot, it is visually very appealing.  It's all about team work, forgiveness and friendship.  I highly recommend this movie as an excellent alternative to the often violent and scary Disney films.  And no princes here.  Just a bunch of girls cooperating for a common goal.  How cute!!",1286668800,28,573,4.584158415841584

Just a warning, its definitely not as  good as the series.  It moves a little slow and the dialog is a pain as some points.  Don't even get me started on  the plot.
