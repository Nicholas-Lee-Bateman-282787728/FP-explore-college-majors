7910215,5,B00000IC6J,"Let's be honest here, folks-- the Slayers Next, in general, is definetely superior to the original Slayers series, and the second box set is INFINITELY superior to the first, in terms of plot and content. After an  utterly hilarious Tape 5 (as always, in each season), the storyline  actually begins picking up-- enemies are introduced, key plot elements are  revealed, along with, of course, the quirky humor... all leading up to an  INCREDIBLE climax in Tape 8 that I guaruntee will knock most viewers out of  their seat. As usual, the dubbing is very high-quality... to be honest with  you, I prefer Lisa Ortiz's performance as Lina to Megumi Hayashibara's.  Eric Stuart, Veronica Taylor, and Crispin Freeman are also excellent, of  course. The basic message I'm trying to get across here? BUY THIS PRODUCT.  Period.",962236800,2,819,5.007407407407407
7910216,4,B00000IC6J,"I complained that the first 'Slayers Next' collection didn't have the cohesive story that I so enjoyed in the original eight 'Slayer' tapes. Well, the last half of 'Slayers Next' pretty much makes up for that  deficiency. After a weak start (an episode where some of the supporting  cast and the Monster appeared borrowed from the Tiki Loungue), things start  kicking into high gear. Finally, we start seeing plot threads come  together, the characters start to interact, and the quality returns almost  to the level of the original 'Slayers' series.
There's plenty of humour,  action, and, yes, even character depth on the last three tapes of the  collection. Despite my misgivings after 'Slayers Next Collector's Set Vol.  1,' I am very glad I went ahead and bought this collection anyway. It was  well worth it. The last tape in particular had some exciting episodes...  they *almost* matched the climactic action of the original  series.
Technically, the animation was still a bit on the weak side, but  the voice acting (in the Japanese language version) was top-notch, and the  storyline was thrilling enough to make up for any short falls.",957052800,,1146,5.0
7910217,5,B00000IC6J,"The conclusion of Next is quite possibly the best ending to any series I have seen. Quite literally, this, the second season of the Slayers tv series, leaves you guessing till the end! You won't believe the twists the  plot has, mostly courtesy of Xellos. For those of you who don't know what  to make of him, I'll just say, ""SORE WA HIMITSU DESU!"" (That's a  secret!) What I was most relieved about was the (once again) centralized  plot that was going within this section. It seemed to be missing in the  first box set, but apparently that was because they saved the plot push for  the end!  To sum it up, forget everything you have thought about  what's going to happen and prepare for the unexpected and a rollercoaster  ride! The last half of Slayers Next is going to move so fast your head will  spin!",954979200,2,807,4.428571428571429
7910218,5,B00000IC6J,"Slayers is in all likelihood one of my favourite anime because of its ability to deal with such weighty issues as possibly destroying the world and encountering God, Herself, without becoming dark, dreary or sad. Always  funny and occasionally using big words, the whole gang from the first  season is back again with some new, possibly even stranger characters added  on. Hard at work once again spoofing all fantasy genre anime (or anything  else) Slayers Next further develops its plot, setting, and -of course-  characters making a positively worth buying them collection of videos.",945648000,2,586,5.191489361702128
