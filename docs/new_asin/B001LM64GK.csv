3686490,5,B001LM64GK,"The whole point of the living landscapes blu-ray series is to have a tape where you can relax - choose either nature sounds or music - no voice over telling you how all this is disappearing because we're bulldozing it down or shooting the animals. The program is about an hour long but it loops around and plays again so that if you are napping you are not disturbed. Or as another reviewer suggests, you can have it on when you have guests over as background. It is just what it says it is - a living landscape that you can visit without needing shots, a passport and 4 hours of security checks at the airport. highly recommended.",1268179200,12,631,4.3559322033898304
3686491,5,B001LM64GK,"I will watch this one over and over. It is so full of beauty and unusual sights. The photographer had to have such patience to get these shots. I could never  see stuff like  this as a traveler or tourist. I saw insects, birds, and  bigger animals  that I did not know existed. And they all seemed to exist in such perfect harmony with their surroundings. Watching  this DVD is a truly inspiring experience. I kept thinking over and over, ""how did he get those shots?""",1267920000,6,468,4.395348837209302
3686492,4,B001LM64GK,"I've been to Costa Rica five times because it is a beautiful country with friendly people. So I got this thinking it would remind me of the country. Well, it does have scenes of nature that appear to be in Costa Rica. The shots are so close you can't tell where it was filmed. One particular waterfall seems to be a favorite as it is repeatedly shown (at least three times). It also appears that the camera was set up in a small clearing and a few birds were caught passing in flight because different birds are seen at different times in the production but the setting is identical (including the framing).
As I was viewing it I decided it would be a perfect DVD to play in the background for a dinner party, open house, or quiet evening at home. The detail on the birds, frogs, and fauna are amazing.
Yes, I'd buy it again.",1263772800,3,825,4.294871794871795
3686493,3,B001LM64GK,"The first hour was fine, but after that we kept seeing the same thing over and over again.  I watched it once.  Dave",1256515200,3,116,4.0
3686494,3,B001LM64GK,"This is fine, if it's what you're looking for, but it's not a normal educational program.  There is no voice-over at all, just pretty pictures.  I love Costa Rica, and I'm no pro with a camera, but it seems to me the locations aren't the best.  I haven't compared others of these types of discs (I've been to C.R. many times), so maybe this is as good as it gets, but I've only watched it once, and doubt if I'll watch it again.",1252713600,,428,4.132530120481928
3686495,5,B001LM64GK,"This DVD is absolutely stunning. I first bought the 10 Most Beautiful Places DVD and fell in love with the stunning videography, music and nature sounds. Now I have most of the DVD's. The Costa Rica one is absolutely amazing. It has video of waterfalls, ocean, hummingbirds and butterflies, parrots and more...The hummingbird footage is spectacular. I've never seen such clear footage of this amazingly small, beautiful creature. I facilitate meditation and literally these DVD's are an awesome visual meditation! Getting out in nature and enjoying its' beauty is a meditation, and these DVD's make you feel like you are right there! I can't wait to start watching the Pacific Coast, Hawaii and others that I have...I would highly recommend this to anyone. The Planet Earth segments have received national attention from Oprah and more, but these are better in my opinion! They don't contain narration (and therefore have that ""educational"" feel) so you can just sit back and enjoy the beauty!

8318663,3,B001LM64GK,one of the many half a dozen visual high definition Blu-ray discs that I used to test the quality when I first got my high definition TV and Blu-ray player good for relaxing and listening to and testing out your equipment visually pleasing but kind of short on the clips basically I think these things were used for what I just explained above early selling point high definition Blu-ray TV and player demonstration discs for sales displays,1386633600,,440,4.7272727272727275
8318664,5,B001LM64GK,This is an excellent DVD with rich and beautiful colors that brings you into the scene as though you can feel it and live it on the spot. An excellent DVD.,1384560000,,155,4.032258064516129
8318665,4,B001LM64GK,"Costa Rica is perfectly suited to this series because Costa Rica is all about the jungle and the birds.  And you get a lot of that on this DVD.  I was happy to see the quetzal, which eluded us when we were there.  Other than the quetzal, birdlife was abundant and most of it is represented on this DVD. Most of the lizards and frogs we saw were also shown in this filming.  Missing from this DVD are any real sights of the 60+ volcanoes, capuchin monkeys, ocean life, crops grown (coffee, pineapples, banana, ornamental plants), other mammals than monkeys, sloths and coatis. As with many others in these series, too many closeups of leaves and too many shots of jungle.  While beautiful, my issue with that is that these shots could be anywhere in the world and are not necessarily indicative of Costa Rica. If there were less of the leaves and jungle and more of the other sights of amazing Costa Rica, this would have gotten 5 stars from me.",1364083200,,944,4.465116279069767
8318666,5,B001LM64GK,"This Blu-Ray is a must buy for any nature lover. It features the most beautiful scenes from Costa Rica, as well as some of nature's beautiful animals/insects. Features beautiful shots of hummingbirds, butterfly, and Toucan.",1359417600,,223,5.4
8318667,4,B001LM64GK,"I'd say 70% of this is stunningly beautiful, lots of birds, flowers etc. A few scenes I didn't care for were  a few minutes of grey muddy crocodiles sleeping on a grey muddy bank and way to many shots of macaws flying in the distance. Some of the footage of the macaws seem to be shot in the shadows so it's not the same quality. I'd say 15% to 20%  of the footage repeats. It's nice that you a option for nature sounds or nature sounds with music both are relaxing.",1358812800,,466,4.1098901098901095
