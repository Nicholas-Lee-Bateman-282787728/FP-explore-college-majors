8685817,1,B00OZOIEPA,"Wow where do I start.  First of all as another reviewer stated the movie case poster is totally misleading.  Not one cute lion or puppy in the movie....just tons of horrible acting and poor musical choices.  My wife and I were thinking can we get those 1.25 hours back, but in restrospect I am not sure as a family we have laughed as much as we just did.  I feel kind of bad because we were laughing about how pathetic it was.  Our six year old said ""this is horrible"".  Good thing we watched it on Netflix and didn't pay for it directly.",1453593600,,538,4.174757281553398
8685818,1,B00OZOIEPA,Awful. I agree that the poster and title make no sense. None of the animals that enticed my 5 year old were in it. There was no zoo and one monkey that they kept showing gnawing on sticks. Awful.,1432771200,,195,4.0256410256410255
8685819,3,B00OZOIEPA,"I have no idea where the title or the poster for this movie came from. There's a single monkey in this movie.... None of the other pictured animals. Regardless, a more accurate title would not have helped this flick. The monkey was the best actor in the whole thing...he was the only ""believable"" character. Every person was clearly cast for their good looks. Wow, I haven't witnessed such across the board poor acting in some time. It's amazing how pretty much everyone was at the same level of ""line reading."" And the direction was just as bad. The first time the neighbor girl sees the runaway monkey she just makes a statement rather than running up to the animal...totally unnatural. Ok ok... It's a low budget dog trying to cash in on the title borrowed from ""We Bought a Zoo."" I get it. The script is poor and the plot is unclear. Other than that...well, my eight year old did like it. (But he's also been known to eat a booger on occasion.) I wanted to be mean and give it one star, but in all honesty it's harmless, inoffensive, and doesn't really try to do more than what it can. And it surely doesn't ruin any noble theme or subject matter! In the grand scheme of movies, I really have seen far, far, far worse.",1426377600,2,1222,4.411504424778761
