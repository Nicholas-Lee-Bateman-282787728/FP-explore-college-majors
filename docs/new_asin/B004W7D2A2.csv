4485647,5,B004W7D2A2,"This movie is one of the reasons I love independent film making.
A great story with a great cast. Simply a MUST SEE.",1307318400,4,116,4.086956521739131
4485648,1,B004W7D2A2,This movie it totally incoherent and aimless with no plot development whatsoever.  Save your time and watch something else!,1307145600,5,123,5.473684210526316
4485653,4,B004W7D2A2,ok,1434240000,,2,2.0
4485654,5,B004W7D2A2,My uncle loved it! He watched it with many guests. It was wonderful.  He loves horses and Chris Christofason. He searched for the movie a long time before finding it on amazon.,1390521600,,176,4.5
4485655,3,B004W7D2A2,"I chose this film because of the good cast but I have to say that it didn't live up to expectations. Kris K. is charming as usual and his songs are probably the best part of the film.  Reece Thompson, a young newcomer, plays the actual lead character in the story and he does a fine job.  I did wonder why he was the only one in the place who didn't have a trace of a southern accent (it takes place in rural Tennessee) but I could overlook that.

I understand that the film comes from a novel and several reviews here recommend the book.  Apparently the facts in the story are better explained in the novel than in the film.  I had a hard time figuring out just why the old guy came back home after twenty years.  There were some dark flashbacks, showing a possible murder?  I guess that's what the secret was.  I rather lost interest in the details of the plot but did sit through it just to see what happened to the young guy.

Fans of K. K. will probably like the film.  But he's been in so many better ones, I'd can't recommend sitting through all of this just to see him.",1379980800,,1077,4.134615384615385
4485656,5,B004W7D2A2,"I like Kris Kristofferson, and this movie was a good one with him in it. Not a big budget movie by any means, but a good family type drama with him in it. Will watch again.",1371686400,,172,3.8055555555555554
4485657,5,B004W7D2A2,If you are a Kris Kristofferson fan you will most definitely not be disappointed in this movie.  Kris is a consummate actor and one of the best songwriters of my lifetime.  This is yet another good product at a good price from Amazon.  Thanks.,1370304000,,243,4.4772727272727275
4485658,5,B004W7D2A2,Kris is a great in this movie really at his best .  The story was very compelling .  It was a good flick to watch!!!!,1365638400,,117,3.64
4485659,4,B004W7D2A2,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but then I am a fan of Kris Kristofferson. The movie does take creative license with the book ""Provinces of Night"".  Characters are the same but some of the situations the characters find themselves in are changed or quite different than the book.",1364428800,,279,4.8125
4485660,5,B004W7D2A2,This is a little know but excellent Kris Kristofferson movie.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan.,1364169600,,114,4.428571428571429
4485661,5,B004W7D2A2,I really enjoyed this movie. The only problem is there was no homosexuals in this picture. I am openly gay and i love men. More male nudity would have really put it over the edge.,1363564800,,179,4.142857142857143
4485662,2,B004W7D2A2,"William Gay was & always will be my favorite author. I'm from his area so his stories are rooted in tales I've heard all my life. Don't watch this DVD if your looking for provinces of night. This movie isn't set in the fifties, there's no bootlegging, its modernish enough to incoorperate oxy abuse though. Many more dark alterations were made to that wonderful book. There was little or no background on the characters. When Bloodworth makes his entrance, the cattle story had been omitted so w/o reading the book, the legal problems would have been quite confusing. It was expertly cast, Kris, Dwight, VAL played their characters flawlessy but without an introduction to these dark folks, you couldn't truely love em or hate em for anything but incredible acting. If you read and loved provinces of night, you might wanna see this movie, dissappointment and all. If you're not familiar w/the book, this movie is frustrating, dark, disconnected, meant to be a 1952 world & its quite an awkward fit/misfit with its modern revamp. Especially if you're fortunate to live in William Gays wonderful Tennessee surroundings. We are not a well represented people in this adaption.",1359676800,4,1173,4.959390862944162
4485663,4,B004W7D2A2,"I liked the story on which it was based, I'm a big fan of Kristoferson and Prine (although he didn't have much to do) but the plot was all over the map and while the film was better than most of the action and technical special effects garbage that's out there, it was just an average experience.",1355097600,,296,4.2105263157894735
4485664,5,B004W7D2A2,"After getting the app Crackle for my tablet, I started watching movies that I wouldn't pay money to watch or I didn't get the time to see them when they were released. That being said, I recently watched this movie and I instantly fell in love with it. Every star in this movie shone in their own way to make it a compelling story to watch unfold. For anyone who loved Crazy Heart or just enjoys a good story..I recommend you watch this. After seeing it, I bought the DVD and have already watched it again!",1352592000,,506,4.28125
4485665,5,B004W7D2A2,"Quite very unexpected. Shows what true love is and can be and has been.... and how many misunderstand and assume,... the wrong story. Rough, raw, tender, funny, sad.",1325721600,,165,4.928571428571429
4485666,5,B004W7D2A2,"I have seen this disc at the store for awhile but I didn't bother as I'm not a huge fan of Kristoferson.  That being said, WOW.  I was knocked on my ass by the entire cast, writing, cinematography, everything.
I have never seen Reece Thompson before.  I am gonna be on the lookout for this kid in years to come.  He's the youngest of the Bloodworth clan.  Dwight Yokam, Val Kilmer, Hilary Duff, W. Earl Conroy, Kris Krisoferson & more round out the cast of immediate family & those who become so.  Rural Tennessee is brought to life in this hard scrabble story.  You truly can believe all of these actors/musicians lived this life.  The overall tone is ""Roll with the punches"".  W. Earl tells Reece, ""You think you're better than your station.""  As if W. Earl cant do better & has lived his life in such a way, that anyone in the family who tries for more should be taken down.  And he tries.
What people will do to get out of one hell for one they hope will be a little better.  Brings them joy & happiness.  How they either dig themselves deeper , try to climb out or just lay down & die.  As I've said before & will again.  The difference between a hole in the ground & a grave is whether or not you're standing up.  That sums up this movie for me.
Enjoy.",1321920000,2,1258,4.200836820083682
4485667,2,B004W7D2A2,This is a very disappointing movie to the point of being boring. A story of a selfish father that needs help when he's run out of friends.,1320192000,,138,4.148148148148148
4485668,5,B004W7D2A2,"This is a quiet little movie that is very engaging.  Very realistic I really liked the characters.  Just when you think you know whats coming next, you don't like, ""didn't see that one coming"".  All the characters seemed true.  NIce ending.",1319414400,,240,4.780487804878049
4485669,3,B004W7D2A2,"I was first intrigued with this movie because of the all-star cast, but quickly lost interest in this convoluted plot.  The first convolusion is using Kris Kristopherson as the leading man.  It's not about Kris K's character, it's about his grandson Fleming, a young man who dropped out of high school but who has a passion for writing.  Fleming spends most scenes in the beginning writing stories based on his short, dysfunctional life.  His grandfather had walked out on his grandmother 40 years ago to make his career in Nashville, leaving the wife to raise three sons.  These three sons, Brady, Boyd and Warren (Val Kilmer) are now three disgruntled men who sit around and drink, use women and curse somewhere in the backwoods of the piney woods.  Two of the sons seethe with anger and hate over their father.  The only son who seems to be the most like the dad is Warren.  The abandoned wife sits in the background with a vacuuous stare during most of the entire movie, saying only a few lines to Fleming  near the hour mark to fill in the blanks as to why her husband took off on her so many years ago.

Cinematography  and scenery are nice (it was filmed in North Carolina), and so is the accompanying music, but the short and varied storyline seems to want to go everywhere too fast.  There's a disgruntled postalman, a flirtatious young woman, several mysterious townfolk and lots of old, run-down wooden homes.  Everyone isn't just flawed, they are seriously flawed and it's impossible to have any sympathy with any of the characters except for Fleming, who remains the only person who seems to have passion, sympathy and drive to get out of the life he's led sofar.

The second convolusion is trying to understand why Kris' character would want to come back to this family that has been so inbred in these backwoods.  He gives the reason in a letter he sends his oldest son before his arrival, but somehow his reason doesn't come across as believable. There are too many redneck stereotypes in this plot that are an embarrassment to hillfolk of Tennessee.

There are a few too many predictable scenes in this short movie, especially toward the end.  The only good thing out of this movie is that Fleming manages to get out of his miserable existence.  What is meant to be a bitter-sweet movie turns out to be a badly-written country flick.

If you like country music or the music of Kris Kristopherson, you may enjoy this movie.",1318291200,4,2439,4.656542056074766
4485670,3,B004W7D2A2,"This is a tough movie to review. On the good side, the acting is really phenomenal. It gives the top billing to either Kris Kristofferson or Val Kilmer but they're more supporting cast than main characters of this film. The journey really centers on Fleming Bloodworth portrayed aptly by Reece Thompson. Not a spectacular performance, but not one that gets in the way of the story. Hilary Duff plays a captivating role as his love interest. W. Earl Brown (formerly of Deadwood) gives an electric performance in a not-so-nice role. Kilmer manages to wear a cowboy hat and talk in an accent and not remind us of his role of Doc Holiday in Tombstone (which was amazing). Dwight Yoakam continues to amaze me with his ability to give incredible ""reality"" to his performances. I think he may be one of the most under-rated actors ever (see Slingblade and tell me otherwise!).

This film is, at its core, a coming of age picture. The problem is that it's set amidst a family tragedy that I don't ever feel is solved. When cut deeper, we're left with a lead character who really for no logical reason or reason we can see and experience comes of age and moves on. This is one of those films that will neither uplift you or really evoke all that much emotion from you, so if you're looking for that, look elsewhere. If you're just looking for something to pop on and zone out to, you might not be disappointed.",1318291200,3,1401,4.537549407114624
4485671,1,B004W7D2A2,"Another super boring, drawn out, pointless movie. I need to stop expecting much because each time I'm let down. Had to take interval breaks throughout because I became so bored and frustrated with my own lack of interest. I was most upset that I spent money to see this film.",1316995200,,275,4.52
4485672,4,B004W7D2A2,The story held our interest and the acting was first rate by all. It is a different movie but made well - nothing offensive or juvenile.  Kris Kristofferson is a one of the best singer/songwriters and it was good to see him in a different role...  Dwight Yoakim and Val Kilmer provided colorful and odd characters which enhanced the story.,1315094400,2,339,4.633333333333334
4485683,4,B004W7D2A2,"It is hard to rate a movie because everyone has differing opinions. I did think this was just worth the rental price. I didn't get a message from the movie except that people can be crazy, mean and wounded with no hope. Good thing that I kept in mind that this was made in Hollywood and not based on real life. Not a feel good movie, just a movie",1314921600,,346,4.028985507246377
4485684,5,B004W7D2A2,"I thought it was a very good movie. Dwight Yoakam is a very good actor in his own right. Kris Kristofferson can still sing, and act.  I would recommend this movie.",1313107200,7,163,4.258064516129032
4485685,5,B004W7D2A2,"I love this movie! Not only did it have two of my favorite people staring in it, (Kris Kristofferson & Dwight Yoakam) but because it was film in Appalachia. I loved the scenery. I also love Kristoffersoin song ""You don't tell me what to do"" He is such a great Songwriter! I hope this one comes out on a CD. He has such a way with words. It's hard to believe he is in his 70's because he sure is doing such a great job in his singing and acting career. Plus he is as handsome as ever!
I was a little disappointed in Dwight's role, only because I wished there was more of him in the movie because he is such a great talent as well. It would have been really neat to hear him sing an Appalachian song as well maybe sitting on his front porch in the movie.
Trust me... go out and buy the Movie. It's worth every penny.",1312070400,3,814,4.0
4485686,5,B004W7D2A2,"Bloodworth is a very interesting movie,very low key and in parts quite dark. Kristopherson once more playing a crusty,worn out singer with considerable baggage. An unwelcome return home being the basis of the story and the family dynamics that follow make for an interesting story. The film has a very strong ndie'feel about it and this may be why it is a little known movie that like so many good movies has slipped under the radar. An interesting story,great location photography,well acted movie that deserves a bigger audience.",1312070400,,531,5.045454545454546
4485687,4,B004W7D2A2,"The movie is worth watching not for plot per se but for the character studies drawn by the actors. W. Earl Brown is superb as the adult son left to care for his now deteriorating mother after his father and brothers effectively abandon the family.
Hillary Duff is luminous as the girl who befriends the sensitive grandson,the one character actively trying to rise above the adult male failures of the family. Together the two seventeen year olds strike a note of hope in this swamp of adult anger, self pity, and irresponsibility. If you enjoy watching a movie more for the acting and less for intricacies of plot you will like the movie.
Note: W. Earl Brown also wrote the screenplay for Bloodworth. You may remember him as Dan Dority,Swearingen's henchman in Deadwood.",1311638400,14,770,4.796992481203008
4485688,1,B004W7D2A2,"If you read William Gay's book, you will be disappointed.  While the actors are good, and doing their best, this script is an abysmal effort to take the book to the screen. Watching this movie reminded of the line that is often attributed to Pat Conroy who allegedly said ""Hollywood gave me complete control over how I cashed the check.""
Save your money. Buy more books.  Donate the money you would spend on this movie to a charity.",1311033600,4,432,4.5256410256410255
4485689,2,B004W7D2A2,"This movie, Bloodworth, had potential. The theme and setting were good, dark with a ray of good and set in backwoods Tennesee. There were some good actors too. The main problem is that none of the characters were allowed to develop enough to allow the viewer to be intrigued, or even interested. With better character development and clarity of purpose this would have been a tense, epic-like movie. It felt like much of the film was left on the cutting room floor -leaving big plot development gaps. I believe the novel, Provinces of Night, that this movie is based on is probably real good. (When I checked the reviews it looks like it's real good.) I've never read it but that's how close the movie gets to being memorable. Too bad because it had potential.

Any viewers that gave this movie 4 or 5 stars are either shills or big fans of a particular actor.",1310169600,2,860,4.548387096774194
4485690,2,B004W7D2A2,"This is a movie that looks and sounds good, and thinks it is a great movie, but is ultimately superficial.  None the characters, except for the grandson, were developed enough for me to care about them.  What was the guitar player / grandfather trying to make peace with, exactly?  There are just a couple flashes to a violent moment that is supposed to define his reason for leaving and him being deeply haunted.  The flashbacks are dramatic, but again do not reveal much of anything about the character, his motivations, or even the circumstances at the time.  The main point I walked away with is the reinforcement of old stereotypes portraying people in rural areas as violent, drunk, crazy, promiscuous, and child abusing. It was insulting.

***SPOILERS****
So the one character I did care about, the grandson, ended up with a woman and raising the son she conceived with his uncle.  Yep, you read that correctly.  Incidentally, her mother is a prostitute.  All this devotion and leap of faith on the grandson's part arises after he goes on a single date with her.  This movie and its ending are just ridiculous, and if you think about it critically, a search for the movie's message/meaning will come up empty.",1309996800,4,1216,4.802884615384615
4485691,4,B004W7D2A2,"Good job showing dysfunctional family and emotions/relationships related to disappointment, betrayal, addiction, poverty and bad decisions.  Varied personalities and interactions kept it interesting.  Fleming and Raven are endearing and refreshing youngsters who act as foils for their senseless, violent elders.  Movie needed more screen time with Dwight Yoakam and more explication of his character.  I think this movie is relatable to many people, even if its characters and their tragic circumstances are exaggerated.  At least I hope they are!  Story of survival despite having all the cards stacked against you set against abject failure.  Loved seeing Kris Kristofferson, but it would have been better with more Dwight and seeing them together on screen.  Excellent settings and music.  Overall I'd probably give this movie 3.5, rounded up to 4 stars.",1309478400,,858,5.589147286821706

8444639,5,B004W7D2A2,Exactly what I wanted.  I really like the movie.,1527552000,,48,4.333333333333333
8444640,2,B004W7D2A2,"I see how it was tempting to make a film of one of the most amazing pieces of writing I've yet come across, William Gay's novel Provinces of Night. But a great book doesn't necessarily make a great movie, and the filmmakers botched it. They botched it in a big way. I got very into the source novel, talking about it on a northern California radio program's literary show, and designing a course in Contemporary Southern Literature for a community college that featured the works of William Gay, Tom Franklin (whose debut book of short stories, Poachers, is shown briefly in the film), and others. Here's the big problem with the film: it's a temporally-confused, anachronistic mess. The source novel has a prelude and epilogue set in the relatively-present time, but the bulk of the story takes place in the (if memory serves) early 1950s. The filmmakers took the events in the novel, which are strongly connected to the times they occurred in, and set them basically in the present, with a confusing jumble of time-periods: Fleming drives a 1970s car, there are land line telephones but no cell phones but there is, oddly, Oxycontin. When Warren is discovered dumping a body, the hunter he meets is straight out of the present day, etc. Gay's novel is firmly rooted in a time and place (rural Tennessee), but the film tries to retain the setting while being lazy about recreating the world of the 1950s, so it feels all disjointed. I think they were going for an approach used (successfully) in the film Jug Face, about a backwoods Southern community isolated in their ways even in the present day, but it just doesn't work in Bloodworth. E.F. has an old-fashioned gun, but hauls water with a modern plastic jug. The film is just full of anachronistic problems. It's like they found stuck-in-time places in North Carolina to film and plopped down modern characters in them, creating a feeling of the time being neither the past nor the present, problematically. For a better use of setting in the gritty South, see Big Bad Love or 100 Proof.

On the plus side, the cast is decent, there's a good use of music, and there are some nice cinematography moments, slow pans of a very pretty rural setting. Hilary Duff does a good job and is easy on the eyes. The actor who plays Fleming utilizes a combination of acting influences, sounding like James Ransone and acting like Edward Norton. Kris Kristofferson has a great careworn face, voice, and affect. William Gay had a wonderful way with words and dialogue -- using a lot of antiquated, Latin-based adjectives in his descriptions and having a great ear for how Tennesseans talk -- and the filmmakers do try and retain some of that in the character's lines. It was nice to see Barry Corbin as a character, as well as the character who was conned by E.F., an actor whom I enjoyed in The Corndog Man.

But the other big problem is how much is left out of the film version. I watched some of the behind-the-scenes, and the director acknowledges the source novel has enough material for ""five or six movies."" But what was cut out of the film from the novel is just brutal, because some of the best stuff was cut: Boyd's relationship with Fleming (such as their work together gathering ginseng); the guy who has a construction site mishap, gets his wages garnished and starts his own taxi; Fleming's other love interest besides Raven Lee; Boyd's time as a drifter-laborer (this is hinted at in the film but must have been confusing for viewers unfamiliar with the novel); some of Fleming's coming-of-age moments and life experiences (such as watching a wildfire burn at night thru Tennessee), etc.

Finally, even tho the movie has very dark moments, its use of music, production design, and mood reminded me of a criticism the great Harry Crews had of many treatments of the South (and which he wrote a magazine article about): it portrays the South in a kind of ""The Waltons"" way, going for a bittersweetness and even cutesy-ness which defeats the purpose of adapting something from the ""grit lit"" canon in the first place. The film's happy ending, for instance, in which everything works out great. I mean, come on. Don't take Gay's writing and try to turn it into a romantic dark comedy set in the present day but at the same time the by-gone South. I think a lot of the film's problems began in pre-production and adapting the novel, such as choosing to abandon the 1950s setting but keep the plot points intact. You can't just send out a props person to find old-fashioned stuff in the South, throw it on a set, add some characters, and have a good adaption of an amazing novel, but that is precisely what the filmmakers did. Do yourself a favor and read the source novel.",1506816000,,4722,4.679903730445247

8444642,3,B004W7D2A2,"Phenomenal actors, story, music, and setting, but too complicated to be crammed into 95 min. If this had been divided into two 2.5-hour films, giving time and space to the story to develop naturally, it could have been the North Carolina Godfather 1 & 2... but the way it was done, all in 1.5 hour, it fails to produce any sense of reality, which is the most serious flaw a film can have.
