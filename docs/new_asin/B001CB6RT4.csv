3506993,1,B001CB6RT4,"""Mausoleum"" is one of those 1980's flicks that I have been waiting to hit DVD. It was one of those films I remember seeing advertised as a kid that really caught my attention. Unfortunately I was too young to see it in the theater, and because the VHS was apparently rare, never had a chance to see it through the years. Finally we get this double feature release from Exploitation Cinema, and after 20+ years of waiting I was finally able to watch ""Mausoleum"".

I see complaints about the video transfer, and after reading IMDB, it seems that the original prints have either been destroyed or lost, so the transfer was made using a cleaned up video print. That's actually okay with me, sometimes the gritty print can actually enhance a film and give it that ""Grindhouse"" look. But even if ""Mausoleum"" had been transferred using a high quality print it wouldn't have helped. This flick was simply awful. I actually became embarassed for all involved while the story unfolded. The acting is over-the-top hammy, and the special effects are laughable at best. I've seen better on old re-runs of ""Fantasy Island""!

The basic storyline is that a young girl becomes posessed by the same Demon that claimed her mother. Flash forward a few years, and the girl is now married and trying to lead a normal life. Unfortunately the Demon gets pretty horny, and has her nail a gardener and seduce a delivery boy...then get all green eyed and murderous on both. The demonic possession scenes are cringe-worthy, and truly embarassing. There is little to no gore, but there is a handful of nudity if that is your thing. As a bad movie lover, I'm glad I was finally able to see this slice of cinematic cheese, but it's not soooo bad as to be re-watchable. To be honest there really isn't any reason to recommend this film at all.",1240185600,5,1811,4.638629283489097
3506994,4,B001CB6RT4,"I don't agree with the others on here and I found the video for Mausoleum pretty good. The sound wasn't exactly great but ok for an old cheap horror movie. It had some background hiss but not that big a deal.
Blood Song on the other hand had good sound but bad video. You could definately tell it was from a vhs.
Overall if you like Mausoleum it's worth the price.",1239321600,4,364,4.140845070422535
3506995,1,B001CB6RT4,Don't purchase this DVD. The DVD quality is worser than the VHS copy. I'm dead serious. I have a VHS copy of Mausoleum and it has a much better picture quality than this mediocre DVD transter. You've been warned.,1225843200,8,212,4.461538461538462
3506996,1,B001CB6RT4,SO THIS DVD  IS SO BAD  MAUSOLEUM IS CUT  AND BLOOS DONG  IS A BAD COPY  SO DON T  BUY IT,1225584000,2,89,3.0
3506997,2,B001CB6RT4,"After years of waiting for ""Mausoleum"" to finally be released on DVD today was a very sad and disappointing day. This DVD release is terrible!

This movie is truly a classic with B Horror movie fans and I think we deserve better.

First. This movie should have been released on its own through Code Red and not part of the Grind house Double Feature Line. Don't get me wrong. I am a huge fan of this line. I just wanted a better release and treatment of the film. This release seems like it was slapped together and released in a hurry with no attention given to the quality of the film.

Now for the problems. Number 1: This copy is CUT! Yes I said Cut! A HUGE mistake. Second: The print, even though Widescreen is full of scratches and imperfections. It does get better as the film progresses but never really looks good. The matting also cuts out most of what little gore was left in this release. And last: The audio is horrible. In mono which is fine but there is a constant loud hiss that is very noticeable, more so in the quieter scenes. It is very distracting. I don't know where they got this print but is has been abused and shows.

Sadly to say I will be hanging on to my VHS copy of this film. Hopefully it will be recalled and another version released. I really hope this is not what we can expect from the upcoming Grind house (Navarre Corporation) releases. I believe they are connected with Code Red and I am very disappointed.

I haven't mentioned anything about ""Blood Song"" because I have not watched it. I understand from reading other reviews it's a Copy from a VHS and is ok. I mainly bought this DVD for Mausoleum. I hope it's good. Then at least this DVD won't be a total waste.

I am giving this release 2 stars. The reason for this is because at least someone has released these films on DVD thus making them accessible to a new generation to discover and enjoy.",1224115200,22,1889,4.337110481586402
8286479,4,B001CB6RT4,Two very good horror flicks. I got a deal last summer when I found a DVD copy for $15. It's amazing how much it's going for on here...,1499472000,,134,3.8214285714285716
8286480,5,B001CB6RT4,one of my best horror movies ever been searching for this one a long time,1439078400,,73,3.933333333333333
8286481,5,B001CB6RT4,"I got this movie mainly for Blood Song because I has seen it years ago on USA, and really liked the movie. I had seen Mausoleum years ago on USA also I believe, but may have missed some of the beginning of the movie. It was great seeing both of these movies again, and they both were as good as I remembered. I do agree that the transfers for both of these movies could have been a lot better than what they were, but they really weren't all that bad like some people say. I have seen way worse transfers of movies to DVD. Fright Night 2 anyone.lol I wouldn't recommend paying the crazy insane price this set is going for now, but if you can get this set for $15.00 somewhere, I would say it's worth picking up.",1406332800,,711,4.122302158273381
8286482,4,B001CB6RT4,"I have owned this double feature set and the MAUSOLEUM transfer sucked big time. I quickly sold it. Now I did hunt down the U.K. release on another site and found one on the 23RD CENTURY label and what a big difference! The movie is totally un-cut,very little film dust in the title sequence and that's it. The rest of the movie is great. And it only cost me one American dollar! The only thing you are going to see is the actual machine when the lady gets levitated off the stair case. So what. I`ve seen boom mikes in other movies get in the way. So if you want to ditch your vhs copy,seek out the U.K. release. Most of these region 0 pal movies will play on your dvd player here in the U.S.And I don`t forsee anyone releasing this movie again in the near future let alone a cleaned up version.",1403827200,,796,4.175324675324675
8286483,4,B001CB6RT4,"I was surprised at first about the transfer for Mausoleum, but after the opening-credits finished I was all into the movie and enjoyed the slightly cheesy transfer effects. It's not bad as some on here have pointed out. It was actually a good thing IMHO it felt like I was watching it back in the early 80's for the first time in a theater. It wasn't annoying at all, the sound was clear and had just hints of audio noise during the right moments and NONE during the speaking parts. And nice to see La Wanda Page's small cameos, mis her from the old Sanford and Son series. BTW, Bobbie Bresee is very easy on the eye and some nice skin shots. Perfect I give it a 4 stars across the board!

I just finished watching the Blood Song and it was another great film. I wasn't expecting it to be so good, but I liked it as well.

Bottom line, its a great Grindhouse Double feature! We can all complain about it not being a single release with more extras and a pristine transfer, but it suits me just fine.",1396656000,3,999,4.225130890052356
8286484,5,B001CB6RT4,"Ignore the reviews that want everything in the crisp, clean ""digital age"". These are 80's flick, they look better grainy, dark and obscure.

Mausoleum (1983) is a strange and somewhat interesting film about demonic possession.

Blood Song (1982) is a rare and almost totally forgotten horror flick made during the 1980s' slasher films. I wouldn't call this one a horror gem, but horror fans looking for the more obscure stuff might want to give it a try.

Overall, not a bad DVD.

Exploitation Cinema: Mausoleum/Blood Song. It really is quite fun to watch.",1386115200,,556,4.946236559139785
8286485,4,B001CB6RT4,"I have been debating whether or not to purchase this double feature for over a year. Based on reviews from other Amazon buyers I put off buying this until recently. Most of the reviews are fairly negative with people saying the picture quality sucks and the fact that Code Red should have given Mausoleum it's own release. This film is out of print and if you don't own a vhs copy from the 80's you'll probably never see this except for clips on Youtube. The quality of my copy is pretty good considering the source material and I already watched this three times already. It definitely has some cult elements to it plus Bobbie Breese has the starring role. Mausoleum does live up to cult movie reputation and it's worth owning in my opinion. As far as Blood Song I watched the first two minutes and the picture quality is terrible. Mausoleum is a really cool early 80's horror movie, it's worth checking out.",1373414400,,909,4.548780487804878
8286486,5,B001CB6RT4,"This movies is a must have. I have searched and waited until the Mausoleum came to DVD. I really enjoyed the commentary with the main star. The commentary allowed the viewer the insight into the plot and climax of the story. The horror and creation of the demon is still as exciting and breath-taking today as in the past before any audience. Oh, the extras movie was great value Blood Song. Thanks Amazon.
