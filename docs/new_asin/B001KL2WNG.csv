3666469,2,B001KL2WNG,"After watching the trailer, I was hooked.  After watching the film, I had buyers remorse.  This film needs a lot more development.  Very good premise, not very good execution.  I would not recommend spending your money on this film.",1308009600,8,232,4.871794871794871
3666470,5,B001KL2WNG,"I highly recommend checking out this film.  Intriguing premise and great performances.  It's not your popcorn blockbuster film, but it has that ""real"" feel to it.

The film follows four different storylines that all come together at a dinner party to honor a deceased grandfather.  It's a great ensemble cast where the performances are very strong from top to bottom.  Larisa Oleynik is a standout and it's great to see her transition into a more mature role.  I wasn't really familiar with Corri English before this film, but I'm going to go and see everything I can with her now - I loved her in this.  Jonathan Murphy, Jason George and Devon Gummersall shine in their supporting roles.

You can tell the filmmakers took a lot of time and care with the music.  I'm a big fan of Joshua Radin and his song was a beautiful choice to end the film with.  In a sea of big budget films, I'm glad there are still character driven indie's being made.",1245888000,10,943,4.5266272189349115
3666471,3,B001KL2WNG,"As stated on the cover, the story of five women who are at a party where their choices shape their future and define who they are, blah, blah, blah...

I say that as the film took these characters' lives and tried to squeeze in their backgrounds, drama and pointless drivel into a 97 minute bookend. Technically, the film does fine on quality and production, with adequate performances by all, but it really does just drag on and on and on without there being enough interest generated on what anyone is doing.

What has to make me laugh the most is the title, and once again as stated on the cover art: ""...Through broken windows we see glimpses desires and unfulfilled destinies..."" huh? What about regular windows and how does one know if your destiny is ever ""fulfilled""? But I gave it a chance anyway. The filming locations of SoCal were fine and the whole premise of an annual dinner party for all of the quasi-unrelated characters to come together works for a bit, but everyone implodes on trying to force the stories through in short order.

A commentary and behind the scenes supplement the DVD. Vanguard has distributed some duds the last two years and customers have become wary of their line, (having more people put the titles back on the shelf once they see who is behind the movie) but I would rate this over the last ten or so films of theirs that have bombed. I don't expect to see this review as being popular since the movie has a rabid following...hope you might enjoy.",1235174400,26,1489,4.569288389513108

8315317,1,B001KL2WNG,"This movie is for Psych majors...everyone else just say, ""NO"".  I'm serious.  This movie revolves around 5 people who all have an issue that's holding them back from really living.  Anyway, as the movie plays out, you get an understanding each person's issue and see them acknowledge it.  But, the movie ends before you see how they deal (or if they deal) with trying to heal and actually move on.  This movie left me asking too many questions while the ending credits rolled.  It was too deep for me, but psych majors will love it.  On a positive note, the music was fitting.",1413244800,,576,4.533980582524272
8315318,4,B001KL2WNG,"Sara is a photographer who is constantly being offered high paying commercial work, but is losing sight of her artistic nature that made her a success in the first place. Her best friend not only challenges her to go back to her roots, but he might very well be in love with her. Amy suffers a loss that has changed her life. Her mother tries to help, her brother doesn't know what to do, and her father gets her to throw a party for her deceased grandfather.

Katie is an actress in an unpredictable relationship with a more successful, but less talented actor. She is trying to decide which path to follow with her career, and her boyfriend is only making things worse.

Beth is a psychiatrist who keeps her secrets hidden deep inside. By coincidence she ends up at a patient's party, and it causes her to open up in a new way. The stories come together and each show us a little bit about the human struggle we all deal with.",1391644800,,928,4.358381502890174
8315319,1,B001KL2WNG,"I had higher expectations for this movie based on other's comments.  It is by far the worst video I have rented.  In my opinion, it was dark and depressing.  And, I do not see why it was listed under lesbian flicks.  It had one scene....lasted probably 30 seconds.  Terrible disappointment.",1381104000,,290,4.72
8315320,2,B001KL2WNG,It was quite dull. Long and drawn out without explaining too much. Not worth 2.99 get something else to kill time.,1369699200,5,114,4.476190476190476
8315321,1,B001KL2WNG,This movie is boring and makes no sense. It was a waste of my time and my money. Don't bother.,1353715200,,94,3.75
8315322,1,B001KL2WNG,Complete waste of time and $3. The actors weren't that bad but the story was so slow I had to fight to stay awake,1335571200,,113,3.75
8315323,2,B001KL2WNG,i cant believe how slow & boring this movie is & i have absolutely interest in any of the characters.  the little bits from the trailer are the best parts for sure not finished watching it yet and its a monumental struggle.,1312329600,2,223,4.309523809523809
