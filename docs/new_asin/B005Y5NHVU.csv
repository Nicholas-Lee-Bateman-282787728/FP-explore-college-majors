My first episode was the the one where the boys were doing a photoshoot and a man was not breathing next to them. Excellent work. Ever since that show I've been wanting to be a Bondi lifegurd. I know how to do CPR and mouth to mouth resusation. Now, all I really want to learn is to surfand being able to experience the thrill of riding the waves. My favorite lifeguards on the beach are Tom Bunting, Whippet, and Brad! You guys are amazing and super amazing and sweet. I am waiting anxiously for season 7 to come out. Keep it up boys!!!",1342224000,,647,4.2682926829268295
