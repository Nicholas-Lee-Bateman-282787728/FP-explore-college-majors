8351308,3,B0025XUTK6,This movie turned out not to be as good as advertised.  I received in a timely fashion and it was in great shape though.,1269820800,2,120,4.0
8351309,2,B0025XUTK6,"From the first impressions that I derived from the trailer I was anxious to see what I thought would be a very moving story of reality and poverty right here in America.  Sadly, this was a poorly written attempt to convey such reality to others.  It simply was.., all over the place with absolutely no continuity of story.  Aside from a good cast, I could hardly wait for this one to be over!",1254009600,5,392,4.342465753424658
8351310,4,B0025XUTK6,"Crumbling, hollowed-out buildings, trash-strewn alleyways and weed-infested empty lots provide the backdrop for ""Explicit Ills,"" a low-keyed, understated account of a group of largely unrelated people struggling to make a go of things amidst poverty and urban decay in Philadelphia. Yet, despite the grimness of the setting, the movie offers a basis for renewal and hope through a cast of characters who don`t exactly fit into the stereotypical slum-drama mold - and in the film's commitment to social justice through unity and action.

In terms of form, Mark Webber's film is more a series of vignettes than a conventionally structured narrative, an approach that actually works quite well given the slightly amateurish, rough-around-the-edges nature of the piece.  Yet, despite limited financial resources, Webber has fashioned a stylish, sometimes even quite visionary work that clearly cares about its characters and the community to which they belong.

Those characters include a young couple caught up in the web of drug addiction; an aspiring actor who's struggling with depression; a seven-year-old chess player who gets picked on at school; a sweet-natured teenager who's trying hard to impress his girl; a pot-smoking mother who's having to counsel her son to stay away from the drug till he's older; and another mother (played by Rosario Dawson) who's desperate to get some much-needed medicine for her asthmatic child.  The characters have little in common with one another except that they happen to live in the same geographical locale and they're all trying to do the best they can with what fate and, in some cases, their own choices and actions have led them to.  The movie ends on a powerful note of optimism and reconciliation after a heartbreaking and gut-wrenching event befalls two of the main characters.

When all is said and done, Webber's first directorial effort is more a work of ""promise"" than a fully realized work of art in its own right.  But if your taste runs more towards the experimental and the ""hip"" and less towards the stale conventions of commercial moviemaking, then ""Explicit Ills"" might well be the movie for you.",1249689600,8,2157,5.163323782234957
8351311,3,B0025XUTK6,"Before anyone gets too upset, the star rating reflects the product rating, not necessarily the content or film making quality. This is a passion piece with poverty activism as its theme, and understandably the director wants to get his message out there, but the Blu package was not utilized in the slightest.

The story follows twelve people in the heart of Philadelphia living out their lives, good and bad, over the events of one summer (2007). Each story gets an introduction (some longer than others) of what to expect, with the last character being introduced at the 37 minute mark. The Crash-esque style editing mixes urban music, painting art reflecting the characters, an assortment of individual camera work in each story (camera pulls, hand held pans, steady-cams) and slightly interlaced stories. This movie deviates from all of the stories having any connection except for the activism march at the end, so do not expect things to come together otherwise.

I did not care for some of the characters (for what the story was trying to convey about fighting poverty) as they ingest/inhale every drug they come across, are typically in a delusional state in each sequence, but then we are supposed to care that they are marching? There were some excellent performances by the young crowd, but there were too many characters to get enough back story and not enough time given to see the outcomes of any one subplot.

There are no special features whatsoever, except for a few paragraphs about what the Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign Outreach is about. The picture quality is DVD level without any upgraded clarity. The sound is fine and the outer channels really only get used with the music mix. The cover art and description do not appear to be entirely accurate (Rated R for ""some"" drug use? - Throughout the story we see a variety of characters taking a bunch of drugs 10 different ways); the description says ""DVD"" features so the Blu cover wasn't given any treatment; since this was an activist film I expected for there to be tons of material and documentaries about the making of and the cause, but they did nothing.

A realistic film with a few good performances, but not a solid Blu. Usually I would say save your money and get the DVD, but today the DVD costs way more than the BD, so maybe it might work out better for you.",1247356800,3,2357,4.755501222493888
