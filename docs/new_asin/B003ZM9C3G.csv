8410584,3,B003ZM9C3G,"Rekha is indeed a Queen. I have decided that, all things considered, she's quite possibly my Favorite Actress of All Time. I can watch her do anything, anytime--and it's invariably interesting, often mesmerizing, and not infrequently sheer magic. She says she has never been too selective about parts, that she's taken what's come her way. But that makes her talent and performances all the more remarkable for having created so many memorable characters and moments, where presumably other actresses would have gone unremarked.

This collection gives a classic, defining role (Umrao Jaan), a good art-film role (Utsav), a solid but not large or emphatic role (Kama Sutra, which is also rather an art film), and the role in Kalyug, where (as in Kama Sutra) Rekha stands out for her onscreen charisma, but where, as it is an ensemble story, her part isn't that big.

It is fortunate that many of this wonderful actress's films are currently available on DVD and online. This boxed set isn't a bad place to start, I suppose--but if you get it, and like Rekha, you are in for a treat--there's a whole lot more out there to be found!",1321401600,,1129,4.814432989690721
