8020072,5,B00021Y850,"A wonderfully delightful version of The Taming of the Shrew. Performed in the classic comedia dellarte form, this retelling of Shakespeare's comedy has flawless comedy, fantastic stunts and a formidable cast to present it all to us.",1441065600,,232,5.297297297297297
8020073,3,B00021Y850,"The startling 1976 American Conservatory Theatre of San Francisco production is a very mixed bag indeed.

It takes its cue from the fact that several of Shakespeares characters are rooted in the Italian commedia dellarte (as is the case in many of his comedies), and it makes of the whole play what it sees as a commedia dellarte spectacle, which in practice means a lot of slapstick and other physical comedy.  At times this works well; but its worth remembering that while Shakespeare draws on many sources for his plays, he tends to transform them, and to use them only as a starting point.  You cant just reverse engineer his work to make it resemble its sources without losing something essential; Shakespeare is not commedia dellarte, and, especially at the beginning of the play (though maybe its just a question of getting used to it), the play gets seriously garbled.  I don't see how anyone who lacks a certain degree of familiarity with the play could have any idea as to whats going on.  The play occasionally gets lost in something its not.

Having said all that, though, I have to add that the production explodes into brilliance in the scene where Katherina and Petruchio first meet, which must be one of the clearest, most thoughtful, most perfect bits of Shakespeare interpretation Ive seen.  Its the only film where the focus is entirely on the fact that Katherina and Petruchio are shown in this scene to really like each other, and to be birds of a feather who are challenging each other.  This is all done with the aid of the above-mentioned physical performing (which extends to the point of including some WWF-style wrestling moves).  Its all brought off with great panache, and the actors professionalism in carrying off all this strenuous physical activity while reading their lines clearly and fluently is beyond my imagining.  (I might add that its the only time Ive seen American performers seem fully comfortable with Shakespeares language, and manage to read the lines with no awkwardness at all.)

Several other key points of interpretation are navigated with great success.  Petruchios concern with the importance of the interior person and the insignificance of outward appearance is emphasized, and no opportunity is lost to show that these two actually end up in love; and at a certain point, it seems that Kate is shown to find her turning point.

On the other hand, I think it was a mistake for Petruchio to look surprised that Kate should show up when he sends for her, at the end; and when she delivers her big speech, she turns away from the widow far too soon.

There are some other negatives.  With a running time of a little over an hour and forty minutes, about 40% of the play must have been cut; and the cuts include the Induction, which to my mind is always a serious error.  Also, the actors manner of speaking is sometimes too stylized; this is especially true of Kate, who is often quite irritating in the way she speaks.  And the live audience sounds like a laugh track at times.

Overall, however, this is a lively and extremely well-executed performance, if a little over the top.  The interpretation is bold and original, and though its too off-the-wall (and too short) to be considered a first choice, its certainly worth seeing as an alternative version.",1432166400,,3310,4.775438596491228
8020074,4,B00021Y850,"Would not play on PS3. The PS3 does not support ""PAL"" what ever that is. Had to view it on computer.
As for the performance, STELLER! probably the best Taming of the shrew ever, defiantly the funniest!.",1419120000,,202,4.486486486486487
8020075,5,B00021Y850,"This is the perfect piece that fully integrates the style, technique and exuberance of Comedy del Arte in Shakespeare's masterpiece.  Marc Singer is a real delight,  Great for theatre classes.",1410048000,,192,5.366666666666666
8020076,5,B00021Y850,"What a wonderful show!  Saw this when it first was broadcast, and still love it.  Comparing it to Taylor/Burton's classic is tough as they are both gems.  But if you want to see a great live performance, ACT doesn't disappoint!",1377216000,,227,4.625
8020077,3,B00021Y850,"I specifically went looking for a DVD of this production to use in my theatre classes. I either didn't read the ad closely enough or there was no mention of the fact that this particular DVD was from Europe, and not compatable with US DVD players.  Luckily, I can play it for my classes via a computer --- but it could have been a huge expense for an unusable purchase.
Now, as far as the Marc Singer/Fredi Oster Production, this is a great way to get high school students to watch Shakespeare and enjoy it.
Just be sure to look for a version that is USA compatable.",1333065600,3,566,4.289719626168225
8020078,4,B00021Y850,I bought the DVD to award as a prize for Shakespeare Recitation. It was greaty appreciated bu the teenager who won it.,1330214400,,118,4.409090909090909
8020079,5,B00021Y850,"In spite of the fact that I own several of Shakespeare's dramas in print, I have never really become fond of any of them with the possible exception of ""The Tempest.""  And to tell the truth, the machismo idea of a husband controlling his wife completely does not go over big with me, since I have my own ideas and opinions for which I am willing to fight.
But this 1974 production charmed me the first time I saw it on television.  Part of it was the comedy, the buffoonery, the utter ridiculousness of some scenes, among them the (Greek) chorus.  The other part was something that cannot be read in a printed version of the drama, and that was the relationship between the two leads.  The moment they see each other, there is something between them which made me feel that they actually fall in love at first glance and don't want to admit it.
In the text, Petruchio is presented as a man who just wants to marry a rich wife, no matter how old, ugly or stupid she is.  Marc Singer  plays him as a outward bully with a sensitive side which he does not show very often.  Several times we see him dejected because he is sure Katherina is going to show him up before the others, and when she turns up sweet, we see the immediate change to outward confidence as if he had never doubted her complete submission to him.
But who could not see the twinkle in Katharina's eye during her last speech where she exhorts her sister and other women to be obedient and do everything to please their husband and master?  And after Petruchio had demonstrated to all and sundry that he had tamed his wife, he was probably content to have as lively a marriage as his courtship had been; otherwise he would have been bored stiff.",1315785600,,1709,4.369085173501578
8020080,5,B00021Y850,"This is the best ""Taming of the Shrew"" I have ever seen, in more than 30 years of theater-going in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and London. And, specifically, Marc Singer presents the best Petruchio of all time.

But to the specifics: I saw this production the first time at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco. You know there are times when the curtain goes up and within the first minute or two you know you're watching a classic? That was my reaction to this version of ""Taming of the Shrew."" The production is based on Comedia del Arte performances which were popular when Shakespeare was writing, so there is no reason to assume he didn't know of them. It's like no performance you've ever seen. The entire production is designed in a dark pink and cream. The costumes are based on Comedia del Arte style, and the codpieces are stuffed as appropriate to each character. Even in Shakespeare's time, the stuffing of codpieces was a common humorous device. Weak male characters would appear with flat and practically empty codpieces. Strong male characters (like Marc Singer's particularly well-musceled Petruchio) appear with full, handsome, but not ridiculous codpieces. Comic males could have codpieces that ranged from flat to ridiculously long, sticklike protrusions. To this day, the degree to which male dancers stuff their jockstraps is always a question of lively debate.

In any case, the production is stunningly physical, with amazingly choreographed stunts, culminating in the wooing scene, in which the tempestuous Kate winds up seven feet from the floor, held up by Singer's very strong arms. It is, to say the least, a robust, knock-about performance. It's also, literally, a very fast performance. The lines, while crisply delivered are piled so fast one upon the other until (to paraphrase Time magazine's unique style of the 1950's) crosses the eyes and reels the head. As a result, the play is nearly over before you notice you're into the last act. It's a fresh, athletic, and truly brilliant adaptation by ACT's William Ball. The jokes are broad and crude, the limbs flailing, and yet all so carefully crafted that each speech seems to flow in naturally with the rest. This is a ""Shrew"" for the ages. Lord knows I've been waiting 30 years for it. Even subtitled in Dutch, it's a must for any fan of the play. Or for anyone who wants to know, ""What is all this Shakespeare business in the first place?""

Yes, it's true, it's a region-2 recording, which means you need a region-free DVD player. I've always been happy with the Phillips players I've bought. After all, without a region-free player, I wouldn't have been able to watch such classics as ""Space Rangers,"" a truly marvelous one-season sci-fi show with plenty of satire of the old standard sci-fi shows, but with plenty of good writing as well.

WARNING: My husband, like his lamentably late mother, both had and (in my husband's case) have problems with rapid speech. And even more problems with accented speech such as the now-classic British ""mid-Atlantic"" accent. If you or yours have problems with fast speech, you should probably skip this version. Wonderful as I think it is, you probably wouldn't enjoy it as much as you should, unless, of course, you treat it like opera and listen to the rhythm and watch the gymnastics.",1294617600,3,3336,4.909574468085107
8020081,5,B00021Y850,"In my almost complete collection of Shakespeare DVDs this is a unique pearl. I could not believe the other review at amazon.co.uk. After very long hesitation I purchased the region 2 encoded version with the unhelpful Netherland undertitling.
This was the effect:
On Wednesday I watched it alone, on Thursday with my friend, on the weekend with the whole family; and the next weekend with friends of the family. We had such a great fun, that for weeks we were quoting to each other from the movie!
Never before or afterwards did I see a record of this play performed in such a witty and screwball-comedy-like way - and still in a very understandable language.
If a fairy would grant me two wishes, I would have this play digitally remastered and other plays of the bard performed in this way too...",1269043200,8,798,4.666666666666667
