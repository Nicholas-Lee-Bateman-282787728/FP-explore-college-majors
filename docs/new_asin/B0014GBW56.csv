8255695,5,B0014GBW56,"I have read the Bible through, I have trouble understanding what I read at times. I have found I am a visual person, ""show me and I will remember it"".  I enjoy watching movies and I definitely understand what I have read.  I watched this movie and sat and realized I knew what was going to happen next from my reading the Bible.  I never listened to people when they would tell the stories of the Bible and they knew them by heart.  Now, I am thirsty for any knowledge I can get, my ""Jesus Movies"" have been a great help to me and this movie is put together well.",1363737600,,563,4.090909090909091
