1207375,5,B00000F4GV,"So once in awhile you come across a heartfelt labor-of-love movie that really makes you think twice about all those effect-ridden hollywood schlops the studios force feed us to feed their pockets. This is it. ""I'll Remeber April"" features a brilliantly crafted story by writer Mark Sanderson and is brought wonderfully to life by an amazing cast including Mark Harmon, Pam Dawber & Haley-Joel Osment. Pat Morita and Trevor Morgan add terrific heart to this often forgotten period in our history where Japanese interment camps effected even small town america as fear got the best of almost everyone. When you see this movie you find yourself thinking ""this really happenned"". You find yourself asking if you would react the same way, what would you do. Director Bob Clark says in the DVD commentary the budget was only $1.8mm. I sure hope hollywood takes note because obviously every penny was spent to ensure the emotion of the film was not lost. Mark Sanderson has a gift for not only adult dialog but also childrens dialog making this story appealing to all ages and believable on all levels. A huge thumbs up--buy it--rent it--own it---it will open your eyes to what a real box office movie is all about.",980121600,15,1208,4.840579710144928
1207376,5,B00000F4GV,"This movie was great in every aspect, and very much worthy of mention! I'll Remember April was a war saga that aimed towards the children of the era, and how it affected them. All of the actors were great, but I am extremely impressed with Trevor Morgan's performance as Duke Cooper. I would recommend this film to anyone who finds relation to childhood friendships, and childhood hardships. With these young fabulous actors in the lead, this is a 6 star film! What a precious piece this movie really is!",979776000,2,504,4.674157303370786

1207464,5,B00000F4GV,"There were actual reports of Japanese submarines patrolling the Pacific during WW II, the time and place of this movie occur right after Pearl Harbor and the Public's reaction which resulted in Japanese Interment Camps. Pat Morita is the owner of a business which is closed by him because he and his family are sent by the Federal Authorities to an interment Camp.  Then there are four boys who pretend they are U.S. Marines and their clubhouse is a command post.  But all four boys have a neighborhood reputation for unfounded rumors and tales.  The FBI ends their fantasy, especially when Pee Wee (Haley Joe Osment), Duke (Trevor Morgan) and Tyler (Richard Taylor Olson) see their friend Willy (Yuki Tokuhiro) of oriental descent taken to an interment camp.  This was a common sight in the state of California after the attack on Pearl Harbor and this Movie, although fiction, portrays exactly what occurred.  Then the boys find a Japanese Sailor who washed up on the beach and taken him prisoner.  As a consequence, events unfold in which the boys face the ethical dilemma to befriend their prisoner and betray their country or become heroes?  This is an excellent family movie. and good for boys to discover how to arrive at ethical choices on a number of matters.",1401148800,,1268,4.815668202764977

The subject matter is dear to our hearts.  We know neighbors who lost everything when they were carted off to the ""the camps.""  This was atrociously criminal on the part of the government.  We can see how easily our government could repeat this and other atrocious crimes against innocent people groups . . .  Yes, it's good to be reminded.

1207514,3,B00000F4GV,"Here's a small movie about 1940s America, when many were comfortable with their prejudices against Japanese Americans after the Pearl Harbor attack. It is a reminder that when people can interact as human beings, race is not nearly as important as character. If you know the Karate Kid movies, you will appreciate the performance of Pat Morita.",1282867200,,344,5.052631578947368
1207515,5,B00000F4GV,"A friend had picked this film up at a sale and we both watched it Saturday and were 'blown away' by it! It is so rare to find family films today that have such really nice and decent people in them,especially,nice kids who are not spewing profanity!
 It was disturbing to see what our government did to our Japanese Americans after Japan's bombing of Pearl Harbor,and has caused me to want to seek out more films and read some books about America's internment camps.
 One of the boys in the story is Japanese and the best friend and next door neighbor of one of the white boys,so how his family is treated is an important part of the story,and so is the boys dilemma after they take prisoner a wounded Japanese sailor they find,and he saves the life of one of the boys.

 A really great family film that you like myself, will want to add to your movie collection.",1276473600,2,863,4.375
1207516,5,B00000F4GV,"While parts of the movie are unbelieveable, the acting, especially that of young Trevor Morgan, makes this a very good movie.  He has the lead role and makes the most of it.  His natural acting ability makes you feel as if you're there, making the movie feel more real.  Others have commented about the movie's story line so I'll leave that out.  One thing I can't figure out is why Haley Joel Osments picture is on the cover.  His supporting role is more like appearances in the movie.  Trevor's definitely the main actor and should have been given credit as such by being on the cover.  At the very least, a group shot of all of the kids should have been on the cover.",1276128000,,670,4.354838709677419
1207517,4,B00000F4GV,"Although not an Oscar winner,this is a good film that speaks to family and kindness. Good neighbors stand up for each other and their principles.  This is a nice change compared to much of the crap being filmed lately.  There is even an oportunity for children to ask why and parents to give good answers.",1254787200,,305,4.527272727272727
1207518,2,B00000F4GV,"It had to happen.  Someone in the well-meaning, simple-minded Hollywood Liberal community heard about the reparations paid to Japanese Americans whose property was stolen before being shipped into camps that were less nightmarish than the camps of Europe but not exactly fun either.  These reparations happened not long ago, too late to help most of the poor, innocent souls whose lives were destroyed by this crackpot bit of social engineering.  So, in that dreamy way of theirs, they looked out at the underpaid Japanese gardeners trimming their trees and watering their lawns and thought, ""What a perfect opportunity for some mawkish, emotionally manipulative revisionist history.""  The result is this goopy, ponderous greeting card of a film in which America's war years are indistinguishable from lazy family picnics in summertime.

As is so often the case, excellent production value and cinematography fail to conceal a multiplicity of flaws.  The picture is a symphony of war era automobiles, all in perfect condition and all recently detailed. (Apparently the war did not impede car care!)  Likewise the neighborhoods, interiors, period costumes, and accessories are lovingly assembled, the overwhelming sense of place is stunning - rather like watching Leave It To Beaver - in color - without the drama.  Nice to see Pam Dawber looking great, how she survived years of working across from Robin Williams in full-blown mania I will never know.  Mark Harmon also looks good and is perfectly cast as an ineffectual nebbish.  Haley Joel Osment nearly steals the film, not because his performance is so noteworthy, it isn't, but because his name and face remind you that outside this schmaltziness, in the larger world, are movies that matter.  Pat Morita also wanders in and out, for reasons known only to his accountant.

I won't trouble you with the plot - (boy, it was hard to seriously apply that word) - because I like you.  The script on this love letter is so thin it must have been written on wax paper.  Suffice it to say that Director Clark would have us believe that the mean old government hatched this ""internment"" thing but the God-fearing local citizens - who actually did business with Japanese people and Americans descended from Japanese - thought the whole thing was ""not very nice"" and cleared their throats aggressively before acquiescing and buying up abandoned homes for a dollar.  Like so many movies desperately searching for value, since they have brought none with them to the party, this film begins by telling you that the story is ""based on true events"".  I'm certain that this is true, to the extent that during those times Japanese Americans breathed air, walked erect, and consumed food and water.  I'm guessing that's where the similarity to anything remotely resembling reality ends.",1220572800,5,2824,5.091106290672451

1207540,4,B00000F4GV,"One of the many problems that occur when politicians declare war, even ""just"" war, is that people are harmed right where they live. And they are simply everyday people. This movie makes that very clear -- and makes it clear that ""the enemy"" are simply everyday people, too. Perhaps only politicians should fight wars.",1126224000,2,317,4.888888888888889

1207542,5,B00000F4GV,"This movie shows how easy hate is transferred from adults to children. It also shows how innocent children are and how easy it is for them to connect with someone so different than themselves. With such a huge language barrier they are still able to befriend a Japanese sailor. Although the relationship started as a soldier/prisoner, it grew to a very long and heart felt relationship. It truly is one of the best coming of age stories I have ever viewed.",1015286400,,456,4.6419753086419755
1207543,5,B00000F4GV,"At a time when we are comparing Pearl Harbor with 911, and the treatment of Afganisganians living here with that of the Japanese Americans in WW2, to accidently come upon such a delightful portrayal came as a surprise to me.  I had never heard of it before, but bought it because I noticed the actors and the fair price and took a gamble on it.  This should be re released!!!!!  It would be a smash.  Children can leaarn a gentle lesson of what went on at that time and perhaps relate it to our present situation.  I don't often find such a jewel...",1012089600,3,549,4.29126213592233
1207544,2,B00000F4GV,"""I'll Remember April"" is a frustratingly uneven film that suffers most from its inability to understand its audience.  Very adult themes such as Japanese prison camps and the deaths of family members in WWII are reduced to condescendingly simple moral lessons that seem aimed squarely at young children, although the subject matter will undoubtedly go over their heads.  Who exactly is supposed to enjoy this movie?  Its most redeeming qualities are its quartet of cute child actors (Haley Joel Osment hardly has a leading role, despite his blatant overbilling on the movie cover) and its willingness to deal with an ugly chapter in American war history, instead of the usual patriotic standpoint.  Unfortunately, these qualities are severely undermined by a ludicrous music score which never appropriately matches the action or the tone of the film, a tendency to repeat the same scenes over and over with hardly any variation (especially the father-son dialogues) and an ending that's a huge letdown.  In some ways this may be a refreshing departure from traditional Hollywood war epics, but ultimately it's extremely disappointing.",1009843200,2,1134,5.312849162011173

1207546,5,B00000F4GV,"Wonderful, funny, poignant film about four boys during World War II who find a Japanese sailor washed up on the California coast near Santa Barbara and take him prisoner in their clubhouse, intending to turn him over to the authorities; only he saves the life of one of them, and they no longer regard him as an enemy.  Here is a film that explores friendship, loyalty, and what happens when you meet an ""enemy"" face to face.  Can two people from different worlds laugh, swim, embrace, and grieve together?
This is a real find -- a small-budget, little-publicized film (it must have gone straight to video) with well-known actors and seasoned direction.  Pat Morita and Trevor Morgan are marvelous in their roles, as is Yuji Okumoto as the sailor.  Great attention has been paid to authentic period setting such as hair style, clothing, music, cars.  It has been shot with a wide lens that gives an impression of light and color.  And unlike many modern films, it leaves the viewer with a sense of wholesomeness.  While some will criticize it for being a bit too breezy, to me it was a breath of fresh air.",996624000,25,1106,4.641025641025641
1207547,5,B00000F4GV,"""I'll Remember April"" is one of the most uplifting movies I've ever seen. We learn enough about the characters to actually care about them, especially the lead character Duke Cooper(who is portrayed brilliantly by one of the best child actors around,Trevor Morgan,who has a wide range as an actor)and his best friend Willy. I give praise to the writers and everyone who worked on this film. This is truly a classic.",996019200,4,415,4.859154929577465
1207548,3,B00000F4GV,"Actually, I rate this movie 3 1/2 stars, but that isn't an option here, so I'll give it 3 stars plus a thumbs up. Most of what the other customer reveiwers had to say was true, though a bit exagerated in a few cases. I do disagree with much of what the Amazon reveiwer, Bruce Reid, had to say. For example, as to the kids' over-repeating their moral indignation. When real kids get something this big on their minds (they learn that their Japanese/American buddy and his family are to be sent to an internment camp) they are like a broken record! If anything, this is understated, not overstated. Another place Reid is wrong is about the musical score. It does no hammering at all. In fact, it happens to be Samuel Barber's Adagio for Strings, for the most part, and seems quite appropriate.
The film's bright spot is its young stars, and it is no stretch to call these four kids stars, because they surely do shine. They are all good actors, and I must say that I was most surprised and impressed by Trevor Morgan, who left me cold in The Sixth Sense as an antagonist. Here he is not only a protagonist but the central character in the story, and the difference in his performance is remarkable. He is very natural most of the time, but this, especially with kids, has a lot to do with the writing, which I'm sorry to say is so spotty and irregular that it swiftly becomes the Achilles heel of this movie.
At times, though, the writing combines delightfully with the superb natural acting of the boys (if indeed it is acting rather than just these four kids being their natural selves with the dialog given them). Their best scene is near the beginning, when the four of them fling themselves onto the bed and read a letter sent to Duke (Trevor Morgan) by his brother Anthony, who is a soldier seeing action in the War. They laugh and giggle and wiggle and hang upside down, all the while making comments that are so natural that the whole scene could have been entirely ad-libbed.
However, this level of dialog does not hold up, and there are times when the overall quality of the movie in all respects seems to be wavering at the edge of an abyss. Fortunately, it never goes over the edge, and we are rewarded in the end with an overall favorable experience. You can poke fun at the story all day long, but in the end it must be said that there is more than enough that is good in this movie to place it a notch above the usual ""kids save the world"" children's adventure story.
I titled this review, ""Good, should have been much better."" I'll stick with that. The kid actors are so good, in fact, that they alone are able to carry the movie, even towards the end when their dialog occasionally borders on the insipid and jarring. You go along thinking one minute you're watching a film that will be among your all-time faves, and the next minute wondering what in the world the writer(s) and director could have been thinking of! It's something of a roller coaster ride.
So, what's the bottom line? This ""kids save the world"" movie is okay and well worth watching. ...Except that in this case the kids not only saved the world, but the movie too!",988588800,20,3149,4.431034482758621
