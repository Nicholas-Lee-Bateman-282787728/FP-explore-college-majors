7727377,1,B01DYZ2VRC,"I would have given it 0 stars, if that had been a choice.

The context was inaccessible to me - I didn't even get what was supposed to be funny about most of them.  And of course the film quality is what you would expect from that era.",1485820800,,235,3.875

7727379,1,B01DYZ2VRC,All cuss words very little comedy - not what I expected.,1485216000,,56,4.181818181818182
7727380,1,B01DYZ2VRC,It stunk,1485129600,,8,3.5
7727381,2,B01DYZ2VRC,Wonderful to see the old stars but it was more a collection of them cursing when they dropped a line as opposed to anything humorous happening.,1485129600,,143,4.538461538461538
7727382,1,B01DYZ2VRC,not funny,1485129600,,9,4.0
7727383,2,B01DYZ2VRC,wish I could have fast forwarded to 2000,1485043200,,40,4.125
7727384,1,B01DYZ2VRC,Waste of my money!,1484956800,,18,3.75
7727385,3,B01DYZ2VRC,"It's funny to see all the trouble some of the biggest stars have with their lines. It's also funny to see which particular curses are most popular. It was also fun to pick which movies were most difficult for some of the actors. So, when I see a movie that was featured in the collection and I see certain scenes it's great to see how the hard work paid off.",1484784000,,358,4.128571428571429
7727386,2,B01DYZ2VRC,Clip after clip of actors flubbing their lines became very boring. I lost interest & stopped watching.,1484784000,,102,5.0588235294117645
7727387,1,B01DYZ2VRC,Awful!,1484697600,,6,6.0
7727388,1,B01DYZ2VRC,"Horrible, got through 10 min then turned off. It's a collection of out takes from bad movies from 40-50 years ago. Back in the days when no one laughed on set when you screwed up. Nothing funny going on here.",1484697600,,208,4.225
7727389,2,B01DYZ2VRC,barely worth the $2.  Most clips are just dumb but there a few goodies but still too much really old stuff.,1484524800,,107,4.095238095238095
7727390,1,B01DYZ2VRC,"Amazon needs to add negative star ratings.
The problems with this ""Blooper Reel"" are multi-faceted:
1) The bloopers weren't funny bloopers, they were just people forgetting their lines and offering a ""G*d D-**m it"" to fill in the blanks.
2) Despite growing up in the late 50's early 60""s, 75% of the actors and actresses were unknown to me.
3) 90% of the flubs weren't funny, just a thespian having a brain fart. (it was worth repeating)
4) For a $1.99 I could have recited 94 minutes worth of unfunny jokes and still been far ahead of what this blooper reel offered
5) After 5 minutes it was boring, then skipping forward in 15 minute blocks of time, it was still boring.
6) Be prepared to kick your own butt if you waste your time on this, and be ready to accept the self-abuse you'll heap upon yourself also.",1484524800,4,811,4.449664429530201
7727391,1,B01DYZ2VRC,What a waste of money and time!!!!!,1484524800,2,35,4.142857142857143
7727392,2,B01DYZ2VRC,not worth the money can't see some of it don't know most of them.,1484438400,,65,3.7142857142857144
7727393,1,B01DYZ2VRC,I can't believe they charged for this. All of the films are so old that no one would remember the actors much less the context of the bloopers. Pass this one by.,1484092800,,161,4.0625
7727394,1,B01DYZ2VRC,I'd give it a zero if possible. Not funny and the stars were so insecure they cursed God and Jesus at every opportunity when they messed up. They were angry and rarely laughed at their mistakes. This is absolutely horrible.,1483660800,2,223,4.6
7727395,2,B01DYZ2VRC,They stop the film right after the blooper. Makes them fun is when you get a few moments of watching the actors be out of character as they laugh and talk about it for a moment. When they edit that part out it is not as enjoyable,1477612800,,229,3.893617021276596
