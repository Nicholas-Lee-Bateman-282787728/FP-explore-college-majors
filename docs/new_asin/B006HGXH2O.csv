8498542,3,B006HGXH2O,"The biggest negative about this vid, among several, is the quality of women. There are some great bodies here, definitely nobody gross (and I've seen a lot of similar videos where that was the case), but the breasts are REALLY disappointing. I actually found myself rooting to see more augmented women even though I really dislike surgically-augmented breasts. Surprisingly given the time period, there aren't many in this video. Instead we see lots and lots and lots of B cups and smaller. And not enough impressive butts to balance it out--or, at least, not enough shots of them.

There's no shortage of full nudity, and a little bit of explicit nudity. Nothing too memorable though. I do like covergirl Jenni Steel (the formula for these Flash Fest Video releases tends to be an adult star's posing intermingled with the typical naked amateur girls on the beach). She was unknown to me previously, but she's a scorcher.",1399852800,,922,4.910256410256411
