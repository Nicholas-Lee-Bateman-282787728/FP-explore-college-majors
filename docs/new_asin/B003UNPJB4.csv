There are so many memories that I have on a personal level for Freedom Hall.  From the first game I ever went to - when I had 2nd level, first row tickets - to the last one I was able to attend, behind the North Goal, with my niece and my son and a few others, to watch the Women's team play.  There are so many memories from TV too - talking my parents into letting me stay up late and watch the game - I ended up getting the black and white TV in my room so that everyone else could sleep - though that didn't quite work cause I'd scream at the TV and the refs.

Freedom Hall just had atmosphere.  It was a beautiful, old time Arena. You could feel the history every time.  And this program captured that feel.  At times, it was glitchy, but that happens sometimes.  The extras were nice - allowing me to see the Halftime Ceremony with the 1980 and 1986 Champion Teams.  Pervis Ellison, DeJuan Wheat, Darrell Griffith, Coach Denny Crum, and so many other amazing players.

Since there will never be another Louisville Cardinals game played in Freedom Hall, I am glad that I have this to look back on.  Glitches and all.  It has the full game, extra interviews, the Senior Day festivities and introductions, Halftime Ceremony, and speeches by the 4 seniors, Rick Pitino, and Denny Crum, with the last statement about Freedom Hall.

End of an Era - that's what it's called - and that's exactly what it was.  Thank you for putting this out there for posterity.  I will enjoy it many times.  Go Cards!",1457568000,,1629,4.341059602649007
