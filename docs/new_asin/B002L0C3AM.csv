8516035,4,B002L0C3AM,"This film details the story of a man who is struggling with the effects of Alzheimer's disease. Neil, the main character of this story, is hospitalized after breaking his hip. He heals, but is not allowed to leave the hospital. He makes a number of friends, but begins thinking that there is a conspiracy against him. This is not true as it is a product of his Alzheimer's disease, yet it is disturbing for him nonetheless. He begins to lose his memory and hear voices that are not really there. This film gives us a view of Alzheimer's through the eyes of someone who is actually experiencing it. The construction of the movie is successful in allowing us to feel like we are going through this struggle with Neil. It is a truly eye-opening film that everyone should see in order to understand the workings of the brain. Extremely interesting!",1271980800,3,844,4.633333333333334
