8244420,5,B00127R2U6,"the plot got better and the DVD worked perfectly fine. I just wish there was a season two coming it [the company that created the anime went bankrupt]. Tatum did a fantastic job as Jiro and next con I see him at, I'm definitely getting his signature on this dvd!

On this DVD the Kwoolen Children appeared [again] and we meet an old blood staying in the special zone Zelmen. He's an awesome vampire! :3

Only disappointment is that there aren't more DVDs after the third one. The plot was clearly not wrapped up completely at the end of the last episode.",1300838400,,554,4.421568627450981
8244421,4,B00127R2U6,"Jiro and Kotaro have made it inside the Special Zone, with the help of Mimiko, professional compromiser. We still don't know exactly why Jiro has travelled to the Special Zone, but he seems to have come at the worst possible time. A Kowloon Child has infiltrated the Special Zone somehow and it appears it is the work of Jiro's old enemy, Cassandra Warlock, whose very presence nearly sends Jiro into a murderous rage. She seems to have something to do with Jiro's lost love, a girl named Alice who he was assigned to protect long ago. Not all is peace and harmony in the Special Zone, where a very delicate balance exists between human and vampire and even between vampire and vampire. Along with Company, three vampire families control everything in the city. All of them are concerned about whose faction Jiro will join, because they know how powerful this legendary hero is. Whoever he casts his lot with will be the main power broker of the Special Zone. Surprisingly, the majority opinion seems to be that the Zone would be better without Jiro in town. Only Zelman Clock, leader of one of the vampire clans, is willing to take Jiro and his brother in. His main goal is not to acquire power, but simply to stave off boredom. But one of his underlings has a different agenda that could start a vampire civil war.

Black Blood Brothers is a show that succeeds in spite of the fact that you can tell the creators didn't have a lot of money to spend on character design or animation. The costumes are mostly dreadful and there are quite a bit of static battles with action lines in place of animation. But the director makes up for this by staging the fight scenes with some interesting shots, dramatic effects, and close ups which convey the action quite well, and give you the illusion of more motion than is actually happening. One of the things I like about the show is the humor. Even though Kotaro is an idiotic pain in the butt, he still makes me laugh as he clumsily makes his way through the life and death stakes of the Black Blood world. Mimiko is also quite funny, but her goofiness is tempered by her extreme dedication to helping Jiro and Kotaro. She might even have a ""thing"" for Jiro, even though she won't admit it to herself. One criticism I have of the show is that it is two thirds over and there are still a lot of unanswered questions about the characters and the plot. I doubt that there are enough episodes left to get through the backstory in anything less than a quick flashback or exposition. Still, this is a series definitely worth watching.",1227398400,,2571,4.529032258064516
8244422,5,B00127R2U6,"The Suppression Team from the Order Coffin Company is destroying and killing vampires of the Kowloon Clan and keeping illegal vampires from entering the Special Zone. But working behind the scenes and powering the Kowloon Children is Cassandra Jill Warlock, who is searching for a special place located in The Special Zone and is breeding Kowloon Children. Meanwhile Jiro Mochizuki, his little brother Kotaro Mochizuki and there Compromiser Mimiko Katsuragi are now in The Safe Zone. Mimiko is helping them pick out a clan to live in (three in all to choose from) while an agency decides to hire Jiro The Silver Blade for their own personal use. Also, the clans leaders are trying to decide two things. One, either let The Silver Blade join there clans (a dangerous decision, as one of the members noted that he is like a bomb ready to explode, probably referring to his immaturity at times and rage at the loss of a love one) or to kill him in order for another clan to not gain his abilities and over-power them.
We get to see more fun interactions between Jiro and Mimiko, such as when Jiro cut Mimiko's alarm clock in half since he didn't know how to turn it off and getting a bucket-full of water dumped on him by a furious Mimiko. To another Compromiser sharing gossip with Mimiko about The Silver Blade entering The Special Zone. We get to see Sei The Dragon King re-enter as a young boy, a brother to the Dark Princess who sustains the barrier by keeping his eyes closed. If he opens his eyes though, the barrier opens (as previewed in the beginning of BBB during the Kowloon Shock after Alice died). We also see new characters, such as Zelman Clock who is an Old Blood born from the Dark Ages, Cain Warlock, as well as others. A vampire that ""takes the place,"" of Johan Tsang from the first DVD is Autumn who is a menace to Jiro and his quest for killing off the Kowloon Children. He is also a Kowloon Child, but nobody knows how he became one since he claims he wasn't bitten by any Kowloon Child.
The stage of the story gets darker than the previous, as Jiro, Kotaro and Mimiko are faced with the harsh reality of The Special Zone. And we are fully introduced to Cassa's family as well as the rest of the villains of BBB series.
A very enjoyable series, although it isn't the absolute best, I consider it pretty high up on the list. If you enjoyed such anime's as Chrono Crusade, Inuyasha, Hellsing, and Fullmetal Alchemist than you should enjoy Black Blood Brothers.",1221004800,,2478,4.533482142857143
8244423,4,B00127R2U6,"The anime itself is good. The presentation, characters, story, animation and dialogue are all well prepared and enjoyable to watch. Too many of the primary and supporting characters are getting lost in the shuffle though. With so much information revealed in the latter part of this volume, it feels as though there are some characters who are not going to get their proper emotional hook by the end of the series. Fun as it's been to watch this series evolve, this series is going to need to deliver a fairly powerful ending in order to warrant a higher replay rating.",1217376000,,569,4.7
8244424,5,B00127R2U6,"If you like Blood + and or Inuyasha, you'll like this. It has the comedy and seriousness of Inuyasha and the vampire of Blood +. I wasn't sure if i would like this series but after watching,i love it.",1211328000,,200,4.153846153846154
