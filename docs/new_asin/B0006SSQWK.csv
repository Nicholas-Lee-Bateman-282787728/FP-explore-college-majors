8043035,4,B0006SSQWK,"Gungrave is a good story about a couple of friends that move up from being street punks to the leaders of a powerful mafia organization. Brandon, the main character is murdered by his partner, Harry, and returns from the grave to take revenge and set things right again. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell. There a lot of really awesome characters and fight scenes in this anime. There is also enough drama and character development to keep you wanting more.

The animation and voice acting are pretty good. You should recognize many of these voice actors. Overall this is a really good anime. Especially for one based on a video game. I recommend it to any anime fan.",1354147200,,675,4.625
