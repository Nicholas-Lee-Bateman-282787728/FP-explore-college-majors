1982710,3,B00019GHU2,I love Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin.  This is one of their early performances.  I enjoyed it but it is not one of their better works.,1328227200,2,132,4.038461538461538
1982711,3,B00019GHU2,"Quality was okay for a B&W movie, I initially thought it was only one movie on the DVD; because one side was not not labeled. I'm a Jerry Lewis & Dean Martin fan and I recommend the movie for the price.",1275609600,,202,3.951219512195122
1982712,4,B00019GHU2,"This is required viewing since it is Martin and Lewis' first movie. As a comedy, it's not that great. It's not very funny, there's a lot of time wasted on generic dialog, and Dean's character isn't likeable since he mostly shouts, bullies, womanizes, and lies throughout. The movie is based on a play and it seems that some portions that may have played well in a live setting don't work on the screen. I can't be too sure since I don't know what is new to this movie and didn't appear in the play, or what did work in 1950 but doesn't work in 2005.

I got a good nostalgic feeling watching the movie. It gave me a feeling of sitting in a playhouse in 1940 with that era of audience and laughing at silly running gags like the half open door. Now that the bar has been raised so many times with comedy superstars like Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, and Jerry Lewis himself, it's fun to watch material from a simpler time.

Dean comes across well. His singing is great, he dances, and does an excellent impersonation of Bing Crosby. This is a good showcase of his talent.

Jerry also comes across well, as expected, with all of his trademarks. Bumbling clowning, funny faces, pouting, mime. His singing was better than I expected. He switches off between various singing voices like his zany voice, mock romantic, sarcastic, etc. He can hit the high notes and he sounds good.

The plot is pretty good. The various subplots involving Jerry, his wife and baby, his former friendship with Dean, Dean's two girlfriends and his military career, Dean's romantic rival, and the captain and his wife make for a somewhat complex plot. The movie builds up to the climax where all of the misunderstandings (and intentional subterfuges by Dean's character) come together with seven actors onscreen at the same time fighting each other to work things out. We're lucky that all seven made it into the TV frame!

I was touched by the ending in the same way that I remember always being touched by Martin and Lewis' movies: as though they are really good friends and that's heartwarming.

I was surprised to see so much polish on Martin and Lewis for their first movie, but you have to remember that they had been doing a live act before this, so that explains it.

I can imagine that a lot of the physical comedy gags, like running in and out of doors, throwing things around the room, jumping in another's arms, running around the room turning off lights, fighting with the drink machine, etc, would have worked in a play where the actors are actually doing that stuff live right in front of you. That would have added a lot of action to this play, where plays can sometimes be boring. On screen it doesn't work for me. It seems silly but nothing more.

Martin and Lewis' act is something like the Smothers Brothers' act. Martin scolds Lewis and Lewis gets meek and pouts.

I think most of the value in this movie comes from the performance pieces. The feature songs, dances, impersonations, and large comedy bits like the drink machine scene and Jerry as a woman are good stuff. I'm sorry to say that the rest of the material, which is probably the original play, doesn't quite cut it",1260921600,2,3193,4.568181818181818

1982773,2,B00019GHU2,"Good news / bad news.

The good news is that this Film Chest restoration is a good print that is pleasant to watch (other than the film credits at the beginning and end).  In fact, there are parts of the film where I actually found myself thinking what a great print it is!  This film has been in the public domain for quite some time, and virtually every version previously released on DVD was lousy.

The bad news is -- if you have to pick just one Martin & Lewis film to watch, don't pick this one.

This story began as a play, and it shows, and that's always been my complaint about the film. It just has that feel to it (for example, the first 30 minutes of the film is in two rooms in a military office). The production values here were moderate at best -- it was the first film to be produced by Martin & Lewis' own film company -- York Productions. Nevertheless, with the restoration, it's decent to watch.

One of the problems here is that the plot as thin as an anorexic. It's about 20 minutes into the film before any plot at all emerges. Meanwhile there are a few funny lines (along the caliber of ""He used to be a soda jerk, but he ran outta soda"").

About 30 minutes into the film, Dean Martin has his first song -- ""Tonda Wanda Hoy"", a clever romantic song with a Hawaiian theme. Polly Bergen, Dean's love interest, doesn't come into the film until 50 minutes in. She really was quite lovely. It's about this time when Dean and Polly duet on the best song of the picture -- ""You And Your Beautiful Eyes""; it's a snappy song with a poor arrangement (better to listen to the Capitol recording).

As far as Jerry Lewis, he essentially plays the same character he played in every other Martin & Lewis picture.

In terms of other supporting actors, Mike Kellin is along (why did he become an actor?), as is band leader Dick Stabile who has a small supporting role.

Suffice it to say that this film is of interest mainly to Martin & Lewis fans (and I am a fan of Martin). At least we've now got a good restoration.",1410566400,9,2024,4.261096605744125

Now, this has to be the best transfer of this movie I've seen to date. While there's still a few jumps the movie seems to be intact unlike other copies I have watched so for me this edition was worth the heavy price tag.  I just wish Paramount would have released it with the Martin & Lewis box set and still hold out hopes that if there is ever a blu ray box set it will be included.",1406678400,10,559,4.009009009009009
1982783,5,B00019GHU2,"I love this movie for countless reasons. There's a lot of cross appeal for so many collectors; WWII war time, Rat Pack, comedy, family friendly, Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, American Standards music and dancing, black & white film, Polly Bergen, etc. It really should be a staple in any movie buffs collection.

Anybody that is critical of the Martin & Lewis schtick of pratfalls, slapstick, camp, jokes & gags, straight man -vs- monkey, just doesn't get it. Dean sings and Jerry goes nuts. It's Martin & Lewis! And this movie is truly a comedy classic. When originally released, it was a box office smash. ""At War With the Army"" was M&L's first starring vehicle. It's correct that they previously appeared in ""My Friend Irma"" and ""My Friend Irma Goes West"", but in supporting roles. It was ""At War With The Army"" that established Martin & Lewis as box office mega-stars and for the next 6 years they ruled the Paramount lot.

I've seen this movie at least 10 times, and now with this Film Chest restored version I'll be watching it for years to come.
A previous version I owned I sold at a yard sale because it wasn't any better than the grainy versions you'll see on late night TV or the other DVDs out there. In fact, this film has been so extensively bootlegged that Paramount opted not to include a restored copy in its recent DVD collection of Martin and Lewis' films. This movie was long overdue for a restoration and Film Chest did an excellent job. Whenever I show a movie for friends and family, it's always via my projector onto a screen. If you got a poor transfer DVD or blu-ray and show it on a very big screen, it looks so much worse than watching it on a small TV. This DVD looked great on my 9' screen and we had a ball watching it. I was very happy that the original aspect ratio of 4x3 was maintained and it wasn't stretched. Keep in mind there has never been an HD quality version of this film on DVD previously. But, there is now.",1406332800,15,1948,4.423398328690808

Slip back into time, when TV still had noise in the picture... looks like gray, black, and white sand overlaying the picture for those younger than I am and haven't had the opportunity to watch TV when it was the newest technology. This will give you a better appreciation for what we now have in viewing technology. We have come so far in such a short time.

Two great movies on one disc. The disc is double sided. One side with Jerry and the other side with Bing.

Good Family Entertainment.",1405123200,,518,4.442105263157894
1982785,3,B00019GHU2,"The quality of this DVD is not the best.  I had some skips and stops.  THere is no re-enhancement to it... The other movie is a Bing Crosby film.  I did not realize that... so if you like Bing... you may like the pair of movies.  I was looking for Jerry Lewis.

1982786,5,B00019GHU2,Huge fan of Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin. this is a twofer. Great extras. It really seems to have the authenticity of an older movie because of the way it was filmed. They did't spend any time cleaning it up (film wise). On my way to buying more Martin and Lewis movies. I do recommend this movie especially for the great price.,1400544000,,327,4.290322580645161

1982790,3,B00019GHU2,"I am founder and president of ""The Dean Martin Fan Center"", so you would think I give everything that has Dean in it a wonderful review - but I also want to be honest...

This set includes two movies, ""Road to Hollywood"" with Bing Crosby and ""At War With The Army"" starring Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. I can only give my review for ""At War With The Army.""

This was Dean and Jerry's movie made for their own production company ""York Pictures"". They had signed a 7 picture contract with Hal Wallis at Paramount, with the stipulation that they could make one picture under their own banner. Made in 1950 (Black and White) , this was an average film at the time... average storyline... average production... average quality... average budget.

Martin and Lewis were on top in 1950. They were so busy with radio and television that it's a wonder they could squeeze in a movie, but they took advantage of their popularity and cranked it out.

I would not venture to say that this is a great movie. Honestly, it's average. Dean and Jerry made 16 movies together, so it is important if you're a Martin and Lewis fan to see this. Don't expect anything great, but it's not terrible either. It's an average simple film... cute but not great. I give it 3 stars out of 5.

Actually for the price, you really can't go too wrong. Hopefully a better quality release will be made in the future with ""extra's"" to help with it's appeal!",1379635200,8,1419,4.484496124031008
1982791,2,B00019GHU2,At War is a great movie and the quality was ok. Fun movie so I'm ok with the so-so quality. But Road to Hollywood was such poor quality I couldn't even watch more than 10 min since it never improved. I recommend just buying the single DVD for At War if that's what you are looking for.,1379030400,,285,4.017543859649122
