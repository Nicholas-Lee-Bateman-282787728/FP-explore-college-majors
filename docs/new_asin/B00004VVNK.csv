As a huge fan of his, I enjoy  anything done on him. This will take you on a journey from his childhood,  all the way up to now.  Where is one of the most famous and recognized  people in the world.  This will cover all the bases for you.  His early  sucess as a high school football player, to his choice to become a pro  wrestler, to his name change from Steve Williams to Steve Austin, to his  struggles in WCW, to the birth of Stone Cold in the WWF.  It shows photos  of it all.  Him as a child, a baby, a teenager, and a pro wrestling great.  I think WWF home video might add their own flavor to this to touch it up a  bit though, but if you like Stone Cold and wanna know alot about him, this  video will do the job.",964569600,8,900,3.9055555555555554
