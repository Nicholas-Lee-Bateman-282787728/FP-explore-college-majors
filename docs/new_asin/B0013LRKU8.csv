8252044,5,B0013LRKU8,"My kids - ages 4 and 6 - love the Chipmunks Go to the Movies series... I wish they would release all of them, especially the Star Wars and Indiana Jones parodies.  While adults can enjoy these as animated comedy, for kids they seem to be about how the characters use their imaginations in playing together. In fact, I wish they'd make NEW ones!  Can you imagine some of this year's blockbusters redone with chipmunks?  (Might be an improvement.)",1218067200,9,445,4.6075949367088604
8252045,2,B0013LRKU8,"Back To Alvin's Future is the best of the bunch as it is a tribute to Ross Sr. Where the boys go back to 1957 to convince Alvin of the 50s to stick with music. Clyde Crashcup was brought back as the kooky inventer.

We Shrunk the Adults was good but The Name change for Mrs. Miller was wierd to hear.

Bigger was not one of my favorites as Alvin sounded like he did when he was smaller.. Besides how many talking chipmunks are there in the human populace... It did not seem to work for me...

Paramount ought to go back and release theriginal 80s series... Go to the movies format is what did the series in.",1207526400,4,607,4.127118644067797
