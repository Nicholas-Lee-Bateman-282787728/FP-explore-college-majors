4710825,5,B005J039H2,"I LOVED THIS MOVIE.  It had everything I look for in a movie; blood and a werewolf.  I admit I am a werewolf fan.  It is my favorite movie monster from Lon Chaney to David Naughton.  I am a sucker for the hair, teeth and claws.  This movie does not disappoint.  The acting and characters are spot on.  The sheriff in this particular movie has to be directly related to Adrian Monk and that is all I will say on that subject.  I will let you decide after you watch it and watch it you must.  I highly recommend buying this DVD.",1334620800,,526,4.078431372549019
4710826,2,B005J039H2,"Dinowolf is actually a released in 2009 film called Dire Wolf - which is more accurate (in that there was such an animal but definitely not in the time of the dinosaurs - and not related to dinosaurs, but hey...

My problem though is more with the fact that none of the reviews have any note of the things Fred is normally noted for and IMDB has no commentaries from anyone about it.  Weird for this kind of film.  I am going to take as wild guess that that is because most of the natural audience did not see this and the few who may have really had little to say.  This implies no nudity (female) - and who would, with no offense, really  wish to see Gil naked.  It also implies special effects not good enough for comment, though possibly not bad enough for same either.  Overall I have to go with my impression that I have no reason to buy/watch this film.  So I won't.  Those who do, enjoy!!",1334361600,,896,4.192982456140351
4710827,3,B005J039H2,I got to say this movie is reasonbly good in terms there's lots of gore and blood and the structure of the werewolf was inpressive so overall the movie has a good plot and a good design.,1326585600,3,186,4.054054054054054
4710828,3,B005J039H2,"Normally, I love these types of films: a throwback to the kind of monster movies made during the 80s.  There's your standard secret lab, the obligatory connection to the military, the experiment that has gone bad AND escapes, and the hapless locals who have to deal with it (IT, being the title character).  It's a solid formula that's difficult to screw up.  While I won't go so far as to say they totally botched the job, some of it is quite fun and entertaining, but I have to say it wasn't something I'd like to keep for future viewings.  Inconsistent is the kindest term I can apply to this movie.  It felt as if there were two different directors doing the work and the final results just didn't mesh.  There are the anemic sections when nothing but talk happens, and then there are the frenetic action/kill sequences that literally explode on the screen.  Both parts are done in two completely different styles of filmmaking.  One part is fun to watch because it's totally crazy and yes, a little messy/bloody.  The other part is slow, tedious, and at all time static.  Slap these two parts together and what you end up with is a film that's barely adequate.  I didn't mind watching it, but that's about it.  Eh.",1325548800,9,1219,4.566820276497696
4710829,3,B005J039H2,"Don't let the cover fool you. It isn't a mega-huge, CGI cross between a dinosaur and a wolf. If it had been, such a great title wouldn't have been wasted. No new plot twists here. No spoilers really possible in this all too predictable made for DVD monster flick. Basically, it's a genetically engineered werewolf type monster that can run around in daylight. Lower shooting cost, no doubt. The daylight does hurt the suspense factor. The kills are numerous and messy. The acting is a bit better than average. Over all it's your standard monster movie fair. No nudity. But enough gore to please the average teenage fan-boy. I like monster movies. So,it's no classic,but it works for me!",1323907200,,686,4.773109243697479
4710830,5,B005J039H2,I love these campy flicks and this one was actually much better than I expected.  A friend of mine told me to pick it up.  I was glad I did.  Buck Rodgers is in it too!  Fun flick.,1320192000,9,180,3.6578947368421053
8475308,4,B005J039H2,"Released in 2009, Dire Wolf (also known as Dinowolf) chronicles events in rural Southern California when a genetically modified creature thats half-dire wolf and half-human escapes a government-funded research facility and goes on a gory rampage. The local Sheriff (Maxwell Caulfield) & game warden (Blake Cooper Griffin) team up with two federal agents (Kristen Howe & John L. Curtis) and one of the researchers (Dawn Ann Billings) to track it down. Gil Gerard has a small part as the commanding officer in charge of the dubious project.

This is an entertaining TV-budget werewolf flick (while some might nitpick that its not truly a werewolf movie, it is at heart). The movie has a humorous edge, mostly with the quirky ""Rainman"" Sheriff, but its largely serious (with a wink) and even has some moving parts, like when a certain character bites the dust and shares his last words with someone close to him. It's nothing great, but it's entertaining and well-rounded TV-horror with a likable cast and some seriously gory parts, not to mention a classy score here and there. On top of this, there are several worthwhile women, including several cuties, such as Kimberly Horner (Amber), Summer Harlow (the blond researcher) and Gina Scoles (the bikini girl).

Dire Wolf was made in the mold of seminal TV-horror flicks, like 1972s Gargoyles. If you like that movie youll definitely appreciate this one. In some ways its even better (although I give the better rating to Gargoyles due to its originality and place in history). The filmmakers, cast and crew of Dire Wolf knew they were making a TV-budget horror flick, but they gave it their all to make sure it was entertaining, amusing, moving and classy.

The film runs 86 minutes and was shot in Southern California (Im guessing because I can find no info on this, not even in the end credits, but it looks like S. Cal).

 Folks I love werewolf pictures but this was way beyond bad. The script, if you want to call it that, was awful. The acting was awful.
 If your one of those jerks who think bad is good in this case be forewarned it is not lol at all. Just stupid.
 One of the worst I have ever seen on the SY/FY channel!",1427500800,,439,3.965909090909091

8475314,3,B005J039H2,"This is a Fred Olen Ray film so you need to expect SyFy/Asylum type quality. Lovers of bad films will find a friend here.

Clark's Bio-Gen company has created a prehistoric wolf-human hybrid which escapes and annoys the local community and folks at Devil's Canyon. Sheriff Parker (Maxwell Caulfield) is an orderly neat freak who had the best comic lines. Jim Martin (Blake Cooper Griffin) calls him ""dad"" although he is not really his father. The cast includes both colorful and drab characters plus a gratuitous bikini photo shoot.

The movie is campy. The creature is Gregory Paul Smith in a bad wolf suit. Plenty of blood and gore.

The film appears on Multi-packs under the title ""Dire Wolf.""

No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1404864000,3,725,4.82258064516129
8475315,2,B005J039H2,"For a B movie it kinda fell short for me . I feel that it could have been SO MUCH MORE then what it was .  I LOVE ""crappy"" low budget B horror movies, But this was substandard even for my taste and that is saying a lot as I enjoy the ""worst of the worst"" when others don't . The gore was MILD and the acting was so bad it wasn't even laughable .  Good little flick for the kids or for the people who can't handle good horror .",1382486400,3,426,3.67032967032967
8475316,1,B005J039H2,"In this day of poor quality, unrealistic, pathetic computer generated ""creatures"" it's nice to see that there are still those who have the ability to do a bang up job of equally god awful old school ""man in a monkey suit"" style creature effects.  Except this creature is a man in a monkey suit with a bear/wolf head.  Add to that the bad acting and poor directing and you have a sure fire competitor for "" Worst Movie Ever Made"" award.  The failure ofthis pic is more the fault of the writting staff and director than anything.  Here is an example;  the sheriff, played by actor Maxwell Caufield, in the middle of what should be a suspensful night time creature attack scene suddenly has his own attack.....of O C D....ventures outside the building they have been trapped in by the creature to straighten a crooked  sign and is viscously attacked right in front of the game warden (Blake Griffith) who is also his son.  Instead of being disturbed AT ALL, it's more like ""oh well"" and business as usual.  Almost every scene has comparable and similar failings.  Other main players are Dawn Ann Billings, Kristen Howe, and Kimberly Horner,  among others, and sad thing is some of these people can act at least moderately well.  The story line has potential, but the script failed period.  Too bad, too sad.  The theme of genetic experimentation gone wrong has been utilized extensively over the past decade or so but lends to the interpretation of the cast and production crew. While this attempt displayed imagination there was no real creativity.  At the very best this is a ""Splice"" wanna be that fell far too short!

THIS IS ONE TO AVOID!!!!",1351468800,2,1643,4.67595818815331
