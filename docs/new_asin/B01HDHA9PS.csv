8765054,4,B01HDHA9PS,"A journey to the great places that Bruce Lee made his extraordinary films.  It's sad that a lot of locations those films have deteriorated through time.  But, some still look as the day he was there that brings a fan closer to Bruce and his way of the DRAGON.  His loss is still felt but this documentary is wonderfully presented that continues to support his legacy.",1507248000,,367,4.53030303030303

8765059,4,B01HDHA9PS,"Bruce Lee: Tracking the Dragon,"" a documentary by Bruce Lee expert John Little, takes the viewer on a tour of locations used in Lees action movies. Many of the sites remain largely unchanged nearly 50 years later. At monasteries, ice factories, and on urban streets, Little explores the real-life settings of Lees films.

In such films as The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, The Way of the Dragon, and Enter the Dragon, Lee staged the elaborately choreographed action sequences that drew audiences, and broadened the appeal of martial arts pictures with his charismatic star power. His films have become classics of the martial arts genre. Littles film takes the viewer behind the scenes to show how methodically Lee incorporated locations around the world into his story lines to give them a grittiness and raw power. Locations include Hong Kong, Macao, Thailand, and Rome.

There are a few books devoted to filming sites in Hollywood and the Los Angeles area used for motion pictures and TV shows. One is devoted solely to Three Stooges movies. But there has never been a book or DVD dealing exclusively with Bruce Lees movie locations. The film uses footage from the actual movies and compares it with what the locations look like today. Fans of the late martial arts star, martial arts films in general, and action movies will most likely enjoy Littles guided tour, which is packed with lots of Lee trivia.

There are no bonus features on the unrated DVD release.",1477440000,,1459,4.875
8765060,5,B01HDHA9PS,"Back in 2013, I reviewed a documentary titled In Pursuit of the Dragon, by noted Bruce Lee historian, John Little (A Warriors Journey). Unlike the most of the endless, oversaturated list of Bruce Lee documentaries  many of which featured the same tired footage, usual interview clips and other useless talking heads  I found Littles In Pursuit of the Dragon to be refreshing because of its one-of-a-kind premise, which focused on the actual filming locations of Bruce Lees four completed films. To quote my review: Using footage from the actual movies to coincide with the what the locations look like today is simply magical. Basically, I loved every minute of it.

When it was announced that MVD Visual was releasing Tracking the Dragon, another Bruce Lee-related project by John Little, I jumped at the opportunity to obtain an advanced copy. But when I finally got my hands on the DVD, I found its official description curiously familiar:

Bruce Lee expert John Little tracks down the actual locations of some of Bruce Lees most iconic action scenes. Many of these sites remain largely unchanged nearly half a century later. At monasteries, ice factories, and on urban streets, Little explores the real life settings of Lees legendary career.

After reading the above, I thought to myself: This must be a repacked, retitled, double-dipped version of In Pursuit of the Dragon thats being marketed as a new film to suck every last drop of profit from a product thats over 3 years old. And boy was I right

Tracking the Dragon IS a repacked, retitled and double-dipped version of In Pursuit of the Dragon. However, I can honestly say that it has been repacked, retitled and double-dipped in the most positive way possible.

Heres a list of the key differences between In Pursuit of the Dragon and Tracking the Dragon. Keep in mind that I didn't watch them both simultaneously, but I did skim through In Pursuit of the Dragon moments after watching Tracking the Dragon, so think of the following as the most noticeable distinctions between the two:

 Tracking the Dragon has optimized audio and visual. Video footage has been remastered and now appears to have more of an High Definition look (even for DVD it pops on a 1080p TV). In comparison, In Pursuit of the Dragon looks fuzzy with lower audio quality.

 Tracking the Dragon is 10 minutes longer than In Pursuit of the Dragon. Thats not say its only 10 minutes longer. In other words, Tracking the Dragon is edited in a tighter, smarter fashion; with more overlaps and picture-in-picture effects, which essentially means more content per frame.
Post-production work on Tracking the Dragon is a lot more professional-looking. Then and now-location footage gels together more cohesively. If In Pursuit of the Dragon appears to have taken 3 weeks to edit together, Tracking the Dragon most likely took 3 months.

 Tracking the Dragon features new/alternative shots, resulting in a different experience. Its also injected with extra clips and photos, which give it much more depth than In Pursuit of the Dragon.

 New segments: Unlike In Pursuit of the Dragon, Tracking the Dragon doesnt end with Enter the Dragon. Instead, were treated with extra footage of Bruce Lees Hong Kong house, Betty Ting Peis apartment (where Bruce passed away) and locations such as rooftops where a teenage Bruce used to street fight, Bruces famous parking lot photo shoot, and much more (wont spoil it for you).

The bottomline: A better title for Tracking the Dragon would be In Pursuit of the Dragon 2.0. Sure, I can understand if some people will dismiss it as a double-dipper, but it all depends on how much you value newly added footage, as well as upgrades all across the board.

Considering Little and his team traveled all around the world to capture all this footage, a new and improved, longer, remastered version of an already-awesome project is worth $20 bucks to me.

Besides, its probably time for you to re-watch In Pursuit of the Dragon anyways  and if you do, youll want to watch it in the form of Tracking the Dragon to get the most out of your re-watching pleasure. If you haven't seen either, then picking up Tracking the Dragon is a no-brainer.",1477353600,9,4197,4.885915492957746
