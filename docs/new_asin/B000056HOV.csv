If anything surprise me, it's how these people dare to use so much cliche here without annoying their customers; And I RECOMMEND it to some of my friends for this reason - you won't believe that anime of this quality can be so famous! (since it's created by the Slayers' author.)",989366400,,342,4.532258064516129
7931979,5,B000056HOV,"The last five episodes of Lost Universe were amazing.  The series does a complete 180 changing from a light hearted action/comedy to an action packed, and emotionally jarring last five episodes. I felt the show really did not come together until these episodes.  If you are a fan of Lost Universe you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD.",987724800,4,336,4.583333333333333
7931980,4,B000056HOV,"Having sat through and watched a multitude of anime series get short-changed in the end, it's nice to be surprised once in a while. The ending of Lost Universe closed out on a very good note. Each of the 5 remaining episodes weren't fillers and kept up the momentum up to the end. The comedy that was so prevalent at the beginning/middle was downplayed to highlight the dramatic turn of events. I have recommended this show before to friends who have purchased the Slayers series, and would do so again.",986947200,6,503,4.6
