8542881,4,B000ZNFUW0,"To say hokey, corny, or otherwise, would be hugely understating my opinion of this movie. Move past it, and you've really got something. I can't imagine somebody being interested in it without an interest in the Ozarks, and everything else involved here. My own personal incentive was partly because I grew up in the Ozarks and know the sites in the film, but mostly because I work at Cosmic Cavern just North of Berryville, between Eureka Springs AR and Branson, MO. This is the cave in which the divers discover near the end of the movie when they emerge from the underground lake. They show many different caves (Cosmic, Fantastic, Blanchard Springs, Marvel, and others, mashed together to portray a massive, unexplored fictional cave system) and an impressive depiction of the caves, despite the fact that they are not the focus of the film. If you took the time to read this whole thing, and you own a VCR, you won't be disappointed.",1400112000,,938,4.7607361963190185
