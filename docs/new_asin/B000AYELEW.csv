It is a very generous package of great and diverse material. The previous release ""Red Planet"" was top notch and this follows in that tradition.

DVD: The Dvd really gives you the feel of being in London in the club with Sky and the band. It is really hypnotic and cool. It is also nice that you get some classic Saxon/Seeds as well as live versions of the new material featured on the CD. It has some nice effects but they are not overdone.

CD: Great new material, diverse in styles and really great to groove to baby! ENJOY!!!!",1150934400,,576,4.218181818181818
