7908105,5,B00000FBKS,"I bought this tape several years ago because it had 'discipline' in the title and I am a big fan of literature like 'The Correction of an Essex Maid.'  I was initially quite shocked to see some tart mumbling to herself and carrying around a mirror for about half an hour. I persevered.
I was at a party once and someone played this really long version of 'Deutschland Uber Alles' by Nico. Everyone left. This film is similar.
The Dreiske Discipline mentioned in the title is a kind of new age rite with some scientology- like overtones. It is supposed to be a style of acting. Jerky movements, high- pitched voices, facial gestures contorted as if the actor were really sick. I wonder how this technique would work if, say, Mel Gibson or Bronson used it. That would be pretty weird.
All in all, despite the extreme discomfort followed by narcolepsy which assaulted me during my viewing of these two exhibitions of hippy theater, I can highly recommend these films. Why? I can't quite say.
Whoever this Dreiske is, I bet the nervous breakdown that must have happened after they finished filming was a doozy.
I gave this tape to somebody after I watched it. They said that they watched some of it but didn't like it at all and they couldn't take it anymore and they switched it off before the end of the sequence with the mirror-and-tart I mentioned earlier in my review.
Thank you for reading this. That you Dreiske Discipline for making this movie.",1279670400,,1448,4.612403100775194
