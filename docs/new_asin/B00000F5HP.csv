8209780,3,B00000F5HP,"A nice enough trip back to the late 80:s during the recordings of Paul McCartneys ""Flowers In The Dirt"". Scenarios is at offer from the studio when Paul and his band (including Linda) forming the songs from that album and they also let themselfs have a go at former McCartney songs, Beatles material and oldies from the 50:s. They seems to enjoy themselfs which creates a good spirit and the conductor's musical authority (in the word's best meaning)is always present even thou he at moments flipping out just for the fun of it. Inbetween the songs there is ""talking heads-inputs"" from the band and of course mostley from McCartney himself in his characteristic easy go lucky but simultaneously substantial way.

But the main reason I ordered this old VHS was that I was hoping to witness some of the cooperation between Paul and Elvis Costello who together wrote four of the songs and sings duet on one of them (""You Want Her Too"") for ""Flowers In The Dirt"". But all we get is short sequences when Elvis lays out ""My Brave Face"" with voice and guitar. So that was an obvious disapointment. Has there ever been made a proper docomentary about the two gigants colloboration?

But still; if you want to check up the Beatles-legend at 47 this is the place to go. (And don't miss the scoop; Lionel Messi had a former career as a drummer!)
