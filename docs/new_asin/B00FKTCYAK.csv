5997034,5,B00FKTCYAK,This was informative and a very good video for all parts of the body not just for the abs and there is also a cardio workout in it as well.,1391040000,13,139,3.6666666666666665
5997035,5,B00FKTCYAK,"I've been following Mike's Six Pack Shortcuts workouts on YouTube for years, but I haven't had enough money to sign up for his $97 sixpackshortcuts course. This DVD is a great total body workout and a good choice for anyone who's looking to try Mike's workouts out for a low price.

The workouts are a lot different than what he posts on YouTube though. These workouts don't have any weightlifting/bodybuilding stuff like some of his YouTube videos do, and he has a few people in the background doing the workouts with them. I actually liked this better than the videos with just him though because I'm just starting off and he has people in there who are closer to my level and not super ripped like him.

I've only been doing this for about 2 weeks and I've already lost about five pounds...feeling much better and healthier too.

The only negative to this is that it does contain a commercial for his full $97 workout course, supplements, etc. I don't mind it too much though since the workout itself is good.

Overall though I am VERY happy with this DVD...it's a killer workout and super cheap. If you like Mike's YouTube workouts, this DVD is definitely worth the $9",1387238400,46,1172,4.5933014354066986
5997036,5,B00FKTCYAK,"Cover everything you need for work out.

The stuff in this video is as much as a personal trainer would teach you.

 And consider about $500+ per month for a personal trainer, $10 is a good deal.",1386892800,4,195,4.216216216216216
5997037,2,B00FKTCYAK,"I only bought this DVD because it was designed by Mike Chang. However, I am pretty disappointed because this product doesn't have any instructional guides as to how to split which days to split the workout. Also, there are advertisements that come with the DVD promoting another workout DVD and there are links in the DVD to Mike's website for ""free bonuses"" which is another attempt to get you to buy his original afterburn sixpackshortcuts workout.",1386115200,40,450,4.934210526315789

5997081,5,B00FKTCYAK,"Bought this DVD at a salvation army for cheap because I was curious. I already work out and my routines mostly consist of calisthenics and running so I thought it would interesting to see what it brought to the table. First day kicked my butt. I was sore the next day, especially my legs and ""bottom."" I will say I think the upper body workout lacks working the chest a bit, but still very good. The custom option is nice because it allows you to change the order of the workouts around. After reading some of the reviews I will also mention that if you are extremely out of shape this workout will be very difficult to complete. But stick with it and you will definitely see results!",1461715200,,684,4.3515625
5997082,3,B00FKTCYAK,"Good workout, I only do the abs one but there are three other workouts included. Music is okay but I will say its better than more workouts.  Ab workout is great but there is no clock timer so I had to time it to know how much time I need to allow before I needed to get ready for work.",1461110400,,286,3.7666666666666666

5997099,4,B00FKTCYAK,"I completed this work out 2 days ago and I am sore! The DVD states there are 4 total body workouts, but in essence there are 6-7 workouts. A Warm-up, Upper Body, Abs, Lower Body, Arms, Cardio & Cool down. All incorporate the core as a major function of the workout. There are 7 exercises in each set that you must do 3 times (each set is approx. 15 minutes each). To do the whole workout, you must dedicate time to complete. It is about 73 minutes total. You can do whatever work out you like as there are the 6-7 options to chose from. The warm up & cool down are not 15 minutes, if I remember correctly they are around 7 minutes each. I did the whole workout and felt it allover the next day; usually day two I am sore, not day one -I was sore for day 1 & day 2! The cardio segment is a bit too high impact for me, so I did modified versions (in which they don't really show you less modified way in this segment). This is definitely an intermediate to advanced DVD, unless you take it slow and do smaller segments at a time and work your way up to the whole workout. Good overall body & core workout. Some moves are difficult, but doing the reps three times helps you to get better each time. I will definitely keep going back to the this DVD for a great workout. I'm looking forward to some ab definition soon!",1452124800,5,1314,4.096899224806202

5997148,5,B00FKTCYAK,"I am a huge fan of his Youtube channel, always looking for home workout tips.  When I saw he made a DVD, I decided to purchase it.  There's a warm-up, four workouts, and a cool-down.  Each of the four workouts consists of 3 rounds of 7 exercises and it makes you WORK! Each of the workouts are about 15 minutes in length, so you can get a total body workout in about an hour (minus warm-up and cool-down). What I also like about this DVD is that there's a feature where you can customize your workout. You can choose which workouts you want to do, and what order you want to do them.  And since the workouts are only 15 minutes, you can easily use these individual workouts as supplements to other workout programs you may be using.",1394323200,25,732,4.282608695652174

8616482,1,B00FKTCYAK,"To Whom It may Concern, hopefully to this guy Mark!
I want to cancel everything right now and get a full refund!  That's about $312.90.
I just ordered the abs over 40 program the other night.  Im 56 years old and just finished Beast Body.  I completed the program but ended up with some injuries and didn't get the results that I was really looking for.  I saw your program and thought that would work.  I purchased the program for $97 bucks, I thought that was a little high but went ahead and did it.  Then purchased some Leptin.
I went to log on but couldn't watch any of the videos, everything I hit I got an error message saying I was not authorized for that program.  I didn't know if I was enrolled in abs over 40 or some six pack shortcut????? Very confused and disappointed. I tried calling for help, waited and waited and ended up, they wanted me to leave a voicemail.  Wow!  Very unimpressed so far!
The next day,  I received a call from some guy acting all tough and cool and saying he is some trainer/coach.  Ok great, thanks for returning my call.  No he was not returning my call he was trying to upsell me!  I told him to hang on I had some concerns.  I told him about my injuries, about how I couldn't watch any videos and where was the nutrition part of the program??? He said that he would personalize a workout plan keeping my injuries in mind (LIE), then said he would unlock the nutrition part so that next time I logged in it would be accessible to me (LIE), Then he said he would help me to get the videos to where I could watch them (LIE), then proceeded to tell me all the supplements and things I needed.  I went ahead and ordered the sleep stuff and the testosterone supplement.  When the next day came I saw where I was immediately charged for the upsell but nothing at all about any personalized workout plan, not even an email from him at all.  Still cant watch any of the workout videos, and still have no idea about where the nutrition part is.  And when I call to get some help, nobody answers the phones!!!!  Its been well over a week now and although I have called multiple times, and emailed multiple times, I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED A CALL BACK!
Im sorry but I want no part of this company, its clear they are only concerned about making money and they have no concern for me at all!
Please just refund my $312.90 ASAP",1467849600,3,2356,4.253932584269663
