8669216,4,B00LZS8XXM,"I have seen bad low budget films (Birdemic, Birdemic 2).  I have seen bad large budget films (Left Behind-the remake, Noah)  This film doesn't belong to either of those categories, and doesn't deserve the bashing it has received.  I think people just enjoy extracting and exploiting all the bad and ignoring all the good.

Yes, there are some less-than-desirables about this film, as there are for films with even the biggest budgets and backing.  But considering this was a lower budget, independent film, it not only exceeded my expectations, it rivaled some of the the blockbusters I have seen this year.

It had the most important thing going for it.  I enjoyed the story.  It captured my interest from the beginning, drew me into the story and the characters lives, and I couldn't wait to see how it ended.  Although there wasn't a whole lot of back story needed for deeper character development, the pace worked well, and the acting was believable and intriguing.

The only area of improvement that I think is worth mentioning here is that the aspect ratio of film wasn't right for the way the scenes were shot.  For some scenes it worked, but for others, I could tell they were fighting to fit everything into the frame.

But perfectly executed or not, this film is worth seeing.",1435536000,,1286,4.743243243243243

8669218,2,B00LZS8XXM,"Jaxon Stone (Timothy Woodward Jr.) defends bad guys even when he knows they are guilty. When Juan Torres (Jerry G. Angel) is accused of rape and murder, he works to free him even though Juan confesses to the crime. Vincent Delacruz (Vinnie Jones) whose son was murdered wants Stone to free Juan so he can kill him. Meanwhile in a subplot young girls are being kidnapped and forced into prostitution so Danny Trejo can do his cameo and get his face on the DVD cover as if he was a major player.

The courtroom drama was poor. Stone opened the film with the worse closing argument I have ever heard. I wouldn't let this guy defend me for a parking ticket. Luke Goss works with Stone as he knows how to Google. The story was fairly linear and had a feel and soundtrack like a made for TV production. Some of the film was shot with a shaky camera for effect, but after they did that for the tied up girls, why did they continue it into the bar scene? And what was that on the lens while Stone was giving a speech in his living room?

California has reciprocal discovery laws, which the film ignores.

Danny Trejo is back to doing small roles that need an ugly Mexican.

Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity. Killing. Minor torture. Abduction. My advice is don't pay to see it. Soft 2 stars",1413590400,3,1290,4.340248962655601
8669219,3,B00LZS8XXM,"""You want me to defend him, set him free and deliver him to you."" Jaxon Stone (Woodward Jr.) is one of the best lawyers in town. When two clients hire him he begins his investigations to find a way to free them. When it turns out that one of the clients has ulterior motives Jaxon is in a difficult spot. Either save the defendant and he dies, or prove he's guilty and Jaxon dies. So judging by the cast alone I was expecting this to be garbage. Nothing against the stars of the movie but most of the movies they have been in have been pretty low budget and slow. That said I will do this review in two parts. First of all I have to say that this is one of the most technically bad movies I have ever seen. The camera goes in and out of focus, the zooms are so close that you can't see the actor's whole face, and the boom mic never seems to be in the right place. Some of the dialog is echoed and some is too loud. All that said though the actual plot and movie was much better than I was expecting. The biggest problem with movies like this have been that they are so slow moving. This movie is only an hour and 15 minutes long so it really moves along quickly. The idea is really interesting and that is what really got me and I ended up staying interested the entire time. I am not saying that this is an amazing movie or something to run out and see but this is a million times better than I was expecting. Overall, one of the biggest surprises I have seen in a while. Far surpassed my expectations. I surprisingly give this a B-.",1413158400,3,1535,4.069306930693069
