8074686,5,B000A59QA0,I saw this on PBS. A documentary about the powerful of women and music. It's about mundane lives of a group of women that become pure magic when they play music together. And they work hard to get there.,1483315200,,203,4.230769230769231

8074689,3,B000A59QA0,An interesting DVD about an orchestra. I was a little disappointed that this DVD is a bit in the past now. I heard the orchestra on Cubavista satellite TV in 2011 when they were stunning and there were more orchestra members. I should have preferred more orchestral playing and less biographies.,1306627200,,295,4.803921568627451
8074690,4,B000A59QA0,"Incredible testament to will power. These women do play great Cuban classical music in a country where resources are hard to come by. After I saw this documentary, how passionate these women are about their music I felt like sending them sets of strings (spare) for their violins, cellos and bass. The have so little and do so much with what they have. Good art will always survive.",1265328000,,382,4.632352941176471
8074691,5,B000A59QA0,"For those who appreciate culture and classical music and yearn for a refreshing new performance, this DVD is worth owning, watching and sharing for years to come. Unfortunately, AMAZON's description of ""actors"" is wrong. Celia Cruz and others cited are not in the film. This award winning documentary/film is an enjoyable expression of a group of women who live in Cuba and play deligthfully well and cohesively. The Romeu Camarata provides us with an excellent example of the art of music and specifically, Cuban classical music. With very limited resources, the performers share their passion and devotion. I hope others will enjoy it as much as I have.",1198972800,8,655,5.074074074074074

8074693,5,B000A59QA0,"This is a spectacular look at the resiliance, creativity and talent of the Cuban people.  A country rich in culture is blessed with superior musical educational opportunity..... without class, color or gender bias.  The director, the artists and the conductor give a realistic portrayal of Cuban life and the music skills combine to enrich the experience.  A complete treat visually. One weeps with joy at the beauty of the group and the musical interpretations.  Exceptional!",1136332800,7,476,5.306666666666667
