8153986,5,B000K2UEWC,"More low to high intermediate West Coast swing. Covers roll turns, whips, hammerlocks, wraps, over wraps, spins, and turns. I recommend this series, which seems to have little feedback at Amazon. My background is three years of private/group lessons, plus dancing at the Tucson Swing Club. I find reviewing this series very helpful as a review of West Coast Swing patterns.

One of the best West Coast Swing DVD on the market. I am still watching it to learn patterns and moves. January 11, 2012.",1247616000,5,496,4.8352941176470585
