Anyway I purchased it on video and the company sent it to me in a timely manner and in good condition.  So now this movie is part of my collection.",1279756800,,302,3.6875

This is a wonderfully entertaining film where nobody can trust each other. I was riveted the entire time I was watching this. Nancy McKeon is excellent as ""the wrong woman"" and I would recommend this film to anyone who loves to be on the edge of their seat for a long time. The perfect thriller!",1057622400,5,493,4.145833333333333
