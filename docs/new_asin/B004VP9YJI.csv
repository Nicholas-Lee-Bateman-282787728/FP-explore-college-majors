8443711,5,B004VP9YJI,"Although Mahler aficionados will already know much about Mahler's life, this documentary film shows you scenes and places important to Mahler's life, and you hear about them from noted ""Mahler personalities"" like Henry-Louis de la Grange, Leonard Bernstein, Claudio Abbado, Thomas Hampson, and Daniel Harding.

It's such a delight to ride in a New York taxicab, with Henry-Louis de la Grange pointing out the building where Alma kept Gustav's manuscripts (in a metal cabinet!), and later we see views of Mahler's view of Central Park where he walked with his daughter, Gucki.  Henry-Louis tells us how, watching her father correcting a score, little Gucki exclaimed:

 ""Oh!  I wouldn't like to be a note, because I wouldn't like to be rubbed out.""

There are some wonderful video clips of Leonard Bernstein conducting Mahler.  A dear friend of mine dislikes Bernstein, for she thinks he makes himself a large part of the performance.  Perhaps, but who among Mahler lovers can criticize someone for showing his passion for the music.  I love Lenny and always will.  His contagious enthusiasm for Mahler spurred much of the re-awareness of Mahler and his music.

Another opportunity this video affords is a closer look at some of Mahler's more unusual instruments,  from the mighty wooden mallet and sound box of the Sixth Symphony, to Mahler's famous cowbells which hint at going higher up the mountain, until the last sounds of earth are those distant cowbells.  There is also the opportunity to see some of Mahler's ""composing huts"" where, during summers, he removed himself from the world to concentrate on writing his music.

I'm so glad they included a particular quote by the famous Austrian painter, Gustav Klimt, on the day Mahler departed from the railway station, after ending his tenure at the Vienna Opera.

Gustav Klimt said:  ""Vorbei!""  German for ""It's over""  (this golden age of ten years of incredible performances that only a genius such as Mahler could produce.",1432166400,4,1979,5.074303405572755

8443713,5,B004VP9YJI,"If you have heard some of Mahler's compositions and want to hear more, this is the place to go. Excerpts of most of his compositions can be found here with commentary from Leonard Bernstein and Pierre Boulet. I would also recommend that you include his lieder and song cycles in your collection, for example Songs of a Wayfarer (Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen) and Kindertoten Lieder, which also appear in his first symphony.",1388448000,,426,4.930555555555555
8443714,5,B004VP9YJI,An absolutely phenomenal documentary of the composer's life and works. The actual location shots were wonderful. The music excerpts were incredible. This is somethng I would spend the money on all over again. I truly loved it.,1375056000,,226,5.135135135135135
8443715,5,B004VP9YJI,"Nice mix of history, pictures and on site with narration and sublime music.  This DVD goes well with Bernsteins collection and Michael Tilson Thomas Keeping Score.",1370044800,,163,5.269230769230769
8443716,5,B004VP9YJI,"This is a first rate documentary.  It has great production values.  It is filled with great performances (filmed performances by Bernstein, Abbado, Boulez plus some purely audio one, i.e. Kathleen Ferrier, etc.)  Also it contains interviews with Abbado, Bernstein, Hampson among others and most importantly Henry-Louis de La Grange, who talks about his life long infatuation with Mahler and takes us to many places crucial in Mahler's life.  I know quite a bit about Mahler but still learned some new things.  A very moving film.",1356912000,,529,5.176470588235294
8443717,4,B004VP9YJI,"For so many people, Gustav Mahler is a love-hate thing - you either are enthralled by his music, or you strongly dislike it.  I fall in the former camp in that I just can't get enough of it.  So for me, this documentary (being focused on bringing the truth of the man to light, rather than the idolized image) was right up my alley if it lived up to its description.  And it most definitely does.

The film includes interviews with Claudio Abbado, Pierre Boulez, Danielle Gatti, Thomas Hampson, and others, and each has something unique to add to the depiction of Mahler being presented.  Fascinating are descriptions and images of areas in which he spent his childhood, as are the images of his summer home where he composed and the artifacts that remain as physical evidence of his presence - his glasses, baton, scores, and manuscripts.  It is enlightening to hear stories of his time in Vienna as well as New York, and the film paints a picture of a man determined to express how he experienced life and music through the musicians he worked with, even though many of them disliked his methods or the way in which they felt he was treating them.  By the same token, the immense regard for Mahler the conductor is strongly communicated, and one can't help but wonder how marvelous it would have been to attend one of his performances.

The documentary also touches on the love that Mahler had for his children, the heartbreak he experienced when one of his daughters died, and the pain when he discovered his wife having an affair with the architect Walter Gropius.  While no film can hope to capture the essence of a life as complicated as Mahler's, Andy Sommer's film does a remarkable job in communicating the humanity of the man, as well as the ways in which his genius set him apart from other people.  It is a fascinating portrait of an incredible composer and conductor, and is worth watching for anyone interested in the man behind this incredible music.",1318204800,12,1965,4.636887608069165
8443718,4,B004VP9YJI,"This engaging and picturesque biograghy of Gustav Mahler deserves praise and appreciation. That the world's foremost expert on his life narrates and that some of the finest Mahler interpreters conduct, serve to enhance the marvelous vistas depicted in this documentary on Mahler's life. While reviewing the details,
struggles, triumphs and anguish of his life, we follow him via stunning photograghy from his birthplace in Iglau, to Vienna, the Dolomites, and finally to New York City. While excerpts of most of his symphonies are
depicted, intelligently inserted to fit his life story, it is surprising that no real mention is made of his Eighth Symphony and his tremendous success at its premiere in Munich. Yet, who can truly argue with the rest? To listen to his music conducted by Bernstein, Abbado, Boulez, and Harding while hearing directly from Henry-Louis de la Grange is an opportunity not to be missed. They dissect Mahler's life and creative output with loving care. We are fortunate, indeed, that this video has been made. It is enjoyable, educational and highly recommended.",1311379200,13,1088,5.222857142857142
8443719,2,B004VP9YJI,"On the face of it, this seems like it couldn't lose - narrated by Mahler's most comprehensive biographer, interviews with noted Mahler conductors - what could go wrong? As it turns out, plenty!

It's done purely chronologically, but anyone who loves Mahler's music or done any reading about him will already know 90% of this. If you want to experience how this should be done, get the Michael Tilson Thomas Keeping Score set, which contains a very good Symphony #1, and whole movements from #5, 7 and 9. His analysis his impeccable, and I did learn a LOT from his set, especially the use of recurring motifs. Plus the sound and photography are top-notch.

Back to the current release. Euroarts lifted sections fron their own Abbado Mahler set (which has excellent sound and picture} but the quality is awful on this disc. Sound is only offered in stereo, no surround. Berstein's set is sampled also, but the sound and picture is dated on the original anyway. Boulez #2 is also sampled, also with much worse picture and sound than the original. This is not a good way for Euroarts to persuade people to buy their Mahler dvds.

Audio samples from Mahler's works are also utilized, but other than Klemperer and Walter, are basically from undistinguished performances. This project is essentially a narrated slide show, except where a guy who looks nothing like Mahler is shown supposedly conducting!

So, if you know this music, and are at all familiar with Mahler's life, save your twenty bucks! Spend a bit more, and get the Tilson Thomas. I was fortunate enough to DVR the PBS broadcast of his set, but I would have bought it if I hadn't managed that.

A wasted opportunity!",1310083200,36,1674,4.758620689655173
