3969027,5,B002QXI2L8,"This ballet was created in 1975 but was then dropped from the repertoire until 1991 when it was revived. This revival was the result of close collaboration between Pina Bausch and the original dancers, Dominique Mercy and Malou Airaudo whereby the original ballet was painstakingly pieced together and reconstructed fragment by fragment. Early operas, such as this by Gluck, were frequently performed with extensive dance episodes and this is a similar idea but in reverse with the singing used to reinforce the dance.

Essentially this very familiar story is very simply told and is all the more effective as a result. The story is re-enacted through dance and portrays the changing relationship between Orpheus and Eurydice as the nature of their love for each other is finally tested to destruction.  This situation is constantly reinforced by two singers who sing Gluck's music which mirrors the story being illustrated by the dance at any one time. This is a close collaboration and achieves a very powerful synthesis. There are some off-stage choral sections as well and these are similarly linked to the dance action. The story in this version does not include Orpheus's final fate of having to wander the earth before being torn limb from limb by the Maenads but ends instead with the unresolved deaths of Orpheus and Eurydice.

For me the tragic story in this format reaches a conclusion that can only be described as even more harrowing than usual. In a way, this could be described as a dance drama with singing. There is nothing here to offend purists from either dance or music camps and much to gain for both. The staging is minimalist but totally effective in so far as it does not detract from the very stark message of the narration. The corps de ballet reinforce the narrative with danced re-enactment of the described events as they unfold. The two lead roles of Orpheus and Eurydice, as performed by Yann Bridard and Maria Wesseling, fully convey the increasing levels of distress and despair of the two as they make their fated return journey to the land of the living only to fail at the last hurdle.

The music is presented in both high quality 5.1 surround sound and stereo and the camera work provides clarity and detail without being invasive or destructive of the production.  This is a powerful concept and is performed with both sympathy and skill and there seems little chance of a choice of performances being offered to future purchasers.  However, bearing in mind the excellence of this production, it seems unlikely that it would be significantly improved upon. For those who are attracted to the program, this should give a great deal of satisfaction and it would therefore seem to reasonable to rate this as a clear 5 star issue.",1342656000,2,2765,4.872340425531915

3969029,5,B002QXI2L8,"This was recorded a year before she suddenly passed away and to see her take a bow at the end is a wonderful thing. I saw a performance by her company in the early eighties and having to wait another thirty years to see another performance  has not diminished my admiration of her. My concern is of the film work itself. It is a dance opera but the director of the video is focused too much on recording the dancers and not the singers, thus sometimes it is difficult to view everything that is going on the stage. Watching it made me realise that for all her accolades as a contemporary creator of dance drama she was very rooted in conventional dance, not that I am complaining,  the work is stunning. It is haunting and very emotionally engaginq.",1316390400,,749,4.420289855072464

3969031,4,B002QXI2L8,"I love this opera and I love ballet, so I put this dvd in my wish list for Christmas. I got it. The music is wonderful and the singing is excellent.  At the end, they all got a prolongued standing ovation from the entire Paris Opera House, and I'm sure they deserve it. But it was  modern dance not ballet, and the entire going ons by the dancers seemed extrenous, superfluous to the music and singing, not an extension of it.  There is no explanation of why Orpheus appears naked and three of the male dancers are wearing leather aprons, or why a couple of the male dancers appear to be dressed in black suits. I personally, did not like it.
Many of the dance sequences were boring and seemed to go on interminably, distracting from the music,
This naked Orpheus did not look at all like the mythical demigod of the story, but just like a young, regular, male dancer.

The best visual part of this DVD is the picture in front.",1293408000,4,927,4.341040462427745
3969032,4,B002QXI2L8,"In general I agree with other reviewers on this.  More ballet than opera which is okay, as little to see in opera version, lends itself more to dance.  The choreography is quite complex, creative and flowing, and quite satisfying.  The weakness is in attempting to bring it to video.  Often, with other works, I feel that I am seeing an opera or video better at home than live, as the camera can come up close, feature movements, emotions that would be hard to see from twenty rows back in the opera house.  In this case, there are so many centers of interest going on at once at different parts of the stage that it is almost impossible to film in any meaningful way.  The film director has the choice of simply locking down the camera at the back of the house so we can see the entire stage, not missing any of the action, but also not seeing anything in close up, or attempting to go in close on some actions, but then losing others.  Often, I felt that the camera would cut away from something that I was attending to, to feature some other action of lesser interest.  Toward the end of the opera, the cameraman and director seemed to have a more consistent, artistically valid rationale for camera movement and cutting, but by then I was sufficiently irritated by wrong choices that it spoiled, at least in part, my enjoyment.  Still, awkwardness of filming aside, this is still a stunningly choreographed and performed work, well worth owning and seeing.",1284854400,15,1460,4.563218390804598
3969033,5,B002QXI2L8,"The German choreographer Pina Bausch seeks to combine elements in their work. Theater, music and modern dance reflecting human feelings. This was attempted by many, but few can have a unique style. His trademark is the stage dance, several times turned to popular music, text, extreme creativity. The risk is part of your DNA, never settled, always sought innovation. His work combines despair, suffering and sorrow with the ""warm expression of love for life.""
  Often draws on personal biography of his dancers, forget the plot and makes the individual the center of attention. His body language is unique, incisive, provocative. This is the differential, the peculiar and creative choreographer found to produce.
  Orpheus und Eurydike is your personal reading of Greek myth. Transforms the music of Christoph W. Gluck in dance, but not forget the roots of the work. The song is present in three characters, recounting the joys and anxieties of the Greek god of music in search of his beloved deceased. Each character has his double, a dancer and a singer. The singers are outstanding: Maria Ricarda Wesseling (Orpheus), Julia Kleiter (Euridike) and Im Sunhae (Love), play their characters just right. Accompany the dancers and interact with them.
  The dance is the central theme, the music flows to the plot, but the steps tell the story. The distribution of the dancers on the stage is differentiated scenic. Width, depth and subgroups show the unique style of the choreographer.
  Orpheus is played by Yann Bridard: the Greek god is naked, desperate search for his beloved, his lyre is the weapon. Enthralls all who are on their way with agile steps, deep, dramatic. Never expressed much smaller movements.
  Love, Mitek Kudo, allows the descent into hell, a lyrical passage persongem trying to join. But the fate of man and even the gods is sealed.
  Marie-Agns Gillot is toile dancer. His final scene shows the weaknesses and rediscover the joys of her lover, but this does not look for it. Dismayed, she provokes, irritates. Its motion-sensitive, sometimes brusque, sometimes fast, feminine feelings show.
  Pina Bausch knows combine modern dance with traditional opera. The choreography is essential in his work, but his theatrical concept is not restricted. The light, the scenarios mirrored the colors of the costumes and silence are important in driving the plot. Choreography that creatively tells the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, without exaggerations or fabrications. The only flaw is in the subtitle: it often does not translate the text, leaving much of the work without subtitles.

3969034,5,B002QXI2L8,"Stage action in many of these early operas is minimal so combining the singing with action in the form of ballet adds to the visual appeal IF that ballet is appropriate to the libretto and singing. Very fortunately the interpretive dance choreographed by Pina Bausch is just that. She first experimented with it in 1975 and this production is a revival of that. The mezzo soprano Maria Riccarda Wesseling has a gorgious voice ideally suited to the role of Orpheus and her role is shadowed by the dancer Yann Bridard.

On first acquaintance this dance-opera interpretation can seem odd and I found it required more than a single viewing to decide if it was personally appealing - and untimately yes it was. The music is beautifully played and sung under the direction of Thomas Hengelbrock which combined with very effective costuming and lighting comes across superbly in the Blu Ray format. The audio quality is appropriately first class.

Highly recommended.",1270425600,18,960,4.99375
3969035,5,B002QXI2L8,"Dance (in bare feet) overshadows the singing in this production of the operatic masterpiece by Christoph W. Gluck premiered in 1762. His goal was ""noble simplicity"" and he concluded with a happy scene in which Amor revivified dead Orpheus and twice-dead Eurydike to resume their love. This production, however, respects their death.

The three principal roles are movingly danced and sung by Yann Bridard & Maria Riccarda Wesseling (Orpheus), Marie-Agnes Gillot & Julia Kleiter (Eurydike), and Miteki Kudo & Sunhae Im (Amor). The singers appear onstage and remain in character. Orpheus appears throughout, and Eurydike dances in the last two scenes. Most dramatic are the emotionally charged corps and chorus. The costumes designed by Bausch's romantic partner Rolf Borzik (died 1980) for the 1975 premiere are marvels of fluidity (thanks of course to execution by the current costume department). The excellent filming and editing was overseen by Vincent Bataillon.

THE SCENES

(1) Introduction & (2) Grief. At audience-left in a high chair is Eurydike (?) in a white shroud/wedding dress, blood red roses in her lap, looking down passively on her burial site. Black-garbed mourners, more women than men, cringe and twist beneath a black sky, in strict adherence to musical beat. Their arms and hands are in relentless motion, outdancing their feet. At audience-right, Orpheus, in ""nude"" briefs, stands rigid, before a brown uprooted cedar skeleton. Then he lies face down before a great laurel wreath. The mourners file off, and he rises to dance an agonized solo as he beseeches the gods to return his dead loved one. Thus appears Amor, who tells him he can invade the Underworld and reclaim Eurydike but must not look into her face. [Here, as well as in Scene 3, Ms Bausch is remarkably creative in distributing her dancers over the width and depth of the stage and animating the subgroups with different activities.]

(3) Violence. In the anteroom to hell three leather aproned men alarm the denizens, some in winding sheets. The music is demonic. Orpheus enters. One woman carries a yarn basket, and white skeins (the thread of life) intersect the excited corps. But Orpheus' beautiful lyre melody elicits a change, and merciful passage beyond the bronze door to his lost bride.

(4) Peace. Women in palest pink dance silkily to the music of blessed souls in a peaceful subterranean meadow. From among them Eurydike, now a contented shade, emerges for a beautiful solo. Orpheus enters and looks for her, then realizes she is behind him as she takes his hand, and he leads her away.

(5) Death. The great stage is enclosed by towering walls dwarfing the characters. Orpheus leads Eurydike in a flame red dress, not yet beyond the province of hell. Their vocal counterparts are onstage and the soprano expresses Eurydike's rising indignation because Orpheus inexplicably will not so much as look at her. Eurydike's extended solo is like a flame darting, swirling about the stage. Pushed to his edge, Orpheus finally turns to her, embraces her, she dies in his arms. Her vocal counterpart falls to the ground, his vocal counterpart kneels beside, Orpheus lays his Eurydike atop her double, and retreats to a far corner. The mezzo-soprano then dominates the stage, still kneeling, for 8 minutes singing ""I have lost my Eurydike."" (This stasis did seem overlong to me, and lessened the dramatic impact.) In the ensuing silence, the three aproned beings appear and take the life of Orpheus, the music resumes and mourners appear. The body of Orpheus is placed at significant remove from Eurydike's, failing to assure us husband and wife will ever embrace again.

AT CALLS...

the enthusiastic audience metamorphoses into rhythmic clapping. Also, finally the Balthasar-Neumann Chorus assembles onstage, and leader Thomas Hengelbrock is led on to sweep his BN Ensemble to their feet--both chorus and musicians have certainly demonstrated artistry perfected. Then Pina Bausch is brought on to roaring appreciation. Looking frail but strong in spirit, she was to die four months after this filming.

FOOTNOTE

Rather than the usual plastic case, the DVD is held inside the back cover of a colorful 36-page book in English, French, and German. The opera is sung in German and subtitles are available in these three languages as well as Spanish and Italian.",1265846400,47,4352,5.116901408450704
8378114,2,B002QXI2L8,"I can't imagine why anyone would give this five stars. Relying on those reviews, I bought it and was disappointed-- not because it was hard to film or because the music didn't sound baroque enough-- but because it seemed contrived. Most of the value of the production comes from Gluck, not Bausch. Balanchine had the right idea with this music. What were all those strings cluttering up the stage as Orpheus made his way to Hades? Oh I get it! Eurydice can go-- but there are strings attached! And that endlessly repeated gesture of the palm covering the eyes-- better not look!-- quickly became irritating. I like ballets where the dancing is beautiful, not ""meaningful."" (What is this supposed to mean? What is that supposed to mean?) When Eurydice dies for good, Orpheus's mezzo-soprano voice continues to lament her death, but Orpheus the dancer is crouched immobile in the corner-- Bausch's tacit admission that maybe she wasn't quite up to the task of choreographing this story. I like Marie-Agnes Gillot. Too bad Bausch gave her more moping than dancing.",1415232000,,1061,4.932960893854749
8378115,5,B002QXI2L8,"If you like dance and opera, I highly recommend the title above which was recently released by Ballet de l'Opera national de Paris. Both films are based on an ancient Greek myth about Orpheus and Eurydice in the underground. There may be other films that deal with this myth that i am not aware of. Black Orpheus won the Palme d'Or at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival. Black Orpheus takes place in Rio de Janeiro during Carnival and all principal actors are Brazilians with roots in Africa. Black Orpheus is in Portuguese with English sub-titles and is available here in Blu-ray and DVD. I have a Blu-ray copy of Orpheus und Eurydike and I believe it is available  here in DVD.",1392163200,,674,4.570247933884297
8378116,5,B002QXI2L8,"If you are surprised by the German title to Gluck's famous opera, it is because the artist who conceived and executed it is (or was) German. The late, and much-missed Pina Bausch was responsible for the choreography and stage direction. Her achievement in both roles defies any degree of praise I can muster. This is quite simply one of the most beautiful, cathartic, inventive and lasting works of art I have experienced. My list of adjectives was carefully selected. First, her production enhances the beauty of Gluck's music, you will not be disappointed with this performance of his score, it's one of the finest. The tone of the dance-opera is tragic throughout; there is no deus ex machine to provide a ""happy"" ending. What this means is that the catharsis or cleansing element of tragedy overwhelms you at the end, you will be lifted to a higher spiritual plane, which is the goal of this love-tragedy. Gluck's opera is not long as operas go, but how do you sustain a dance for 104 minutes? Pina Bausch and the dancers show with consummate skill in both choreography and dancing. The inventiveness of scene after scene is breathtaking. The singers are on the stage with the dancers, and the interplay of the two artists embodying the same character increases the impact of each role. I consider this element one of Pina Bausch's inspired inventions, brilliantly executed. Finally, I called this ""a lasting work of art"" and I mean this production by Pina Bausch and not just Gluck's score, which has been a classic for generations. I must cite Yann Bridard, premier danseur of the Paris Opera Ballet, who dances Orpheus, for his excellence and passion, but truly all of the dancers deserve praise for their work. Also, the soloists, chorus and orchestra present a masterful version of Gluck's score. I encourage you to seek out a film called PINA, a documentary film about Pina Bausch and her company, made by her close friend Wim Wenders after her death. The film contains many excerpts from her dance creations with poignant reminiscences of her by her dancers. It's very moving and cathartic. On the DVD cover there is a quotation from Pina: ""Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost."" Amen.",1391558400,,2195,4.856
8378117,5,B002QXI2L8,What a marvelous production.  We were not sure about an opera/ballet combination but it works - beautifully sung and staged! A powerfully dramatic telling of a very sad tale.,1391385600,,174,5.0
8378118,1,B002QXI2L8,"Is this really ""the music"" of Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice or his Orphee et Eurydice? I was expecting a modern dance to accompany Gluck's instrumental and vocal setting of either the original Italian libretto of Calzabigi or his later setting of the French libretto of Moline.

That it is sung in German should have been a tip off to me that I was not going to be getting either version of Gluck's reformed Baroque opera, but I didn't pay close enough attention to that detail when ordering this DVD. The printed material that comes with the DVD doesn't help me figure out what libretto is being used. Based on the German title and the use of German throughout, I'm wondering if it isn't the German play by Kokoschka which Krenek set as Orpheus und Eurydike.

In any case, to my untrained ears the singing sounds closer to a mash-up of Beethoven's Fidelio and Wagner's Das Rheingold. To this untrained listener the singing is in no way remotely Baroque, however reformed. The only way I could tolerate watching the dance is with the sound turned off. So labeling this as ""music by Gluck"" seems misleading, even if it follows Gluck's orchestration.

Maybe another reviewer could explain what is going on here. In any case, Baroque opera fans beware!",1375401600,4,1245,4.728110599078341
8378119,5,B002QXI2L8,"Orpheus und Eurydike is a dance-opera.  Pina Bausch took Gluck's ancient Orpheus and Eurydike opera and tells the story very strongly.  I knew the story, having seen the entire opera with a contra-tenor playing Orpheus. Once I figured out the sub titles, allowing me to follow the story line better, I was able to understand better the action.  Many of the words of the libretto are stripped away leaving the stark tale of twice lost love.  The interplay of the dancer and singer pairs in the last scene is remarkably outstanding.

The voices are excellent, sung on stage by two outstanding sopranos. The singers are in beautiful, long, black, floor length gowns, and mostly allow the dancers to be the visual center of attention.

The dancers are all superb bringing out the anguish, the grief, the sadness, the loss of the tale. The dancing is strong and graceful and well demonstrates the emotions of the characters.  The costumes are very effective.  The ladies all wear over the shoulder, floor length white gowns, except Eurydike who wears a similar, very red gown.  The men are very effective mostly in dance shorts, occasional jackets or aprons.  Orpheus is very effective in his dance shorts, his exposed postures, body language and facial expressions portraying the emotional part very well.

The settings are simple, but support the action.

The overall passion of the love of Orpheus for his Eurydike is obvious from the start, soon after her death. The underworld is portrayed as Gluck and the ancient Greek tradition saw it, not the modern Christian, Dante, version.  The long, emotional walk up from Hades is well set with the singer and dancer pairs interacting very well.

The dance - opera combination is very effective in this case, making a strong production.  I have seen one other combination of dance and opera (beyond the French tradition of throwing in a ballet scene) and that was the Denver Opera production where a set of 2 - 12 dancers danced the moods and emotions of the characters around the characters.  My memory fails me.  That was either Hansel und Gretel or Orpheus und Euryudike.  It was also very effective.  So, in good hands, and the right story, the combination of dance and opera can blend to make a more effective production than either alone.",1366761600,2,2287,4.863049095607235

They recently performed in New York after a long absence, but friends who know I hate Pina Bausch wondered why I was going to see this ballet. My answer was that this glorious Gluck Opera is usually dreadfully static on the stage, and I was curious how it would look when danced. The evening was absolutely extraordinary.  Bausch seemed to have been reined in from his weird excesses by Gluck's lucid classical music.  The choreography provided passion to the simple libretto.  There are certainly finer vocal renditions of the opera, but as an overall experience they can't come close to glory of this deeply moving dance/opera.  Filming dance is always difficult,and Bausch's work loses a bit on film, but the dancers are exquisite.  This is truly a stunning achievement!!!",1354320000,,865,4.972222222222222
