8727234,3,B013C7I3PG,"Travis, an underground comic book artist with a penchant for obscene caricatures, upsets a Chinatown crime lord who responds by cutting off the young man's hand. As a despondent, drunken Travis wallows in post-severed hand depression, his decomposing limb returns to life and is determined to exact revenge. First, I loved Adam Boys who plays Travis. The above description came off the package because I could not figure out how to explain it. There are many instances of gory violence and a lot of sexual references of every king so if you are squeamish in any way, this is not for you. I loved the ending of if and must admit that I had moments that I almost turned it off but I stuck with it and saw the dark, very dark humor coming across, this is a much darker version of ""Idle Hands"" which I adored. The cast if very competent and the revenging is imaginative, too. You can tell ""low Budget"" but as I say, low budget doesn't always mean cheap movie. Give this a go if you like gore and some dark humor.",1493337600,,1008,4.424731182795699
8727235,3,B013C7I3PG,"I took off another star (now a 3 star movie) because the more I thought about the absent gore, the more I felt betrayed. The story would be  great with over the top with decent gore effects but it leaves them out and becomes a very average movie I almost don't recommend watching.

I took off a star because of the low gore I initially expected to be in this. Inexplicablely left out.

Where did this come from?!
I love b movie horror like this but you can only watch basket case and frankenhooker so many times..
This is a very well done and not as crude as the old stuff special effects.
Must see if you like the genre, probably a good intro if you don't or are not sure.",1478649600,,673,4.122137404580153

Horror comedies never get old for me.  I love movies that can make me smile and cringe, especially when a nice amount of gore is thrown in for good measure.  BLOODY KNUCKLES is one of these films.  It is a heck of a lot of fun, and its a great flick all the way around.  I laughed so hard at some points that I had to pause the movie to catch my breath.  Even so, this film won't be for everyone; it has some pretty offensive stuff that might anger certain folks.  But if you can look past that, and take the film for what it is, youll have a blast.

I haven't enjoyed a good severed-hand film this much since IDLE HANDS.  Not that Ive seen many severed-hand flicks since, butwell, you get the point.  This film is as crazy as it is shocking, and youll probably want to watch it more than once.  I can definitely see myself revisiting this one soon.

BLOODY KNUCKLES is shot well and looks good from a production standpoint.  It appears to have a modest budget, and the production crew does a great job utilizing the funds available.

The acting is great, with Adam Boys in the role of the comic book artist who loses his hand.  I am not familiar with him, however I hope to see more of his work in the future.  He is supported by a great cast that includes Kasey Ryne Mazak as the evil Leonard Fong; Ken Tsui as Taviss half-brother, Ralphie; Dwane Bryshun as Homo Dynamous; and several others.

The special effects are outstanding, and they are big part of what makes BLOODY KNUCKLES so good.  I love how the effects guys gave the hand a personality of its own; this severed appendage is a major smart-ass, but it is also as creepy as it is funny.

BLOODY KNUCKLES is a major win for me, and fans of horror comedies will definitely want to check this one out.  Chocked full of good old gory fun and a whole lot of laughs, this is a film youll revisit several times, just to enjoy it over and over.  The film hits stores tomorrow, so make a note.",1445817600,3,2019,4.219321148825065
