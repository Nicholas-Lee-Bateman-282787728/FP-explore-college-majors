531547,5,6302993628,"This is an excellent story which was first transmitted in England between September 14 and October 12 1968.
As other reviewers have alluded to, this is a surreal story set in the land of fiction with some humorous and novel moments - finding a cardboard cut out of Jamie with a blank face, the Doctor discovers some facial feature pictures nearby, places them on the blank face and has a different looking Jamie for a while, or when Jamie climbs up atree in a wierd forest to discover that the forest is actually made up of words!
The fascination of Doctor Who has always been a combination of things. On a basic level there is the science fiction story which of course, the BBC wanted to turn into a semi-educational thing so it included the latest scientific developments which were becoming popularised. There are other levels too. Doctor Who was often played in a pseudo-Shakespearian style as part of the BBC remit to bring Drama to the masses. However, one of the great things about the show was the constant trying out of new approaches. This is one of the finest examples of those attempts.
Although this appeared in the heady, revolutionary days of 1968, this tendency had always been around in Doctor Who viz. the whole concept of the Daleks in 1964 (when teenagers had not long been invented!). This story is full of surrealism and novelty. At the same time it's central concern with books is a strong signal to young people about the importance of learning in cultural transmission as well as being enjoyable and how easily characters can be brought to life.
The ending is a little flat because the 'Master' is found to be a kidnapped English author and of course all of the books are English. This is of minor importance and does not detract from the story. One can only imagine what could be done with such a concept in today's terms with the special effects that are out there.
Outstanding.",1025308800,5,1905,4.6390532544378695
531548,4,6302993628,"One of the most imaginative stories in Doctor Who took place during the notoriously unpreserved Patrick Troughton era.  Fortunately, The Mind Robber survived the BBC purges for us to enjoy, and it's bizarrely surreal with a capital biz!
The TARDIS leaves the space-time dimension into a place where anything is possible.  ""We're nowhere, it's as simple as that.""  Jamie and Zoe enter nowhere, represented by a blank opaquely white background.  The TARDIS breaks up, and they find themselves in a strange land full of life-size toy soldiers, a forest of words, unicorns, a Minotaur, Medusa, Rapunzel, and other characters.
They constantly encounter a British sailor who speaks in a well spoken but extraordinary manner, and the Doctor deduces his identity later.
Riddles and intuition are helpful in this land.  And the Third Doctor's explanation to Jo in The Mind Of Evil, ""we believe what our minds tell us to,"" is also apropos here.  When Jamie and the Doctor try to rescue Zoe, they hear her voice behind a door without a handle.  ""When is a door not a door?  When it's ajar.""  The door vanishes, and guess what they find Zoe trapped inside?
Wendy Padbury stands out as Zoe.  She is cute as a button, in a glittering black catsuit, hanging for dear life on the disembodied TARDIS console like an exotic ornament.  Another time, she has her turn as Emma Peel, using martial arts to overcome the Karkus, a Teutonic comic book superhero.  Christopher Robbie (the Karkus), would return in Revenge Of The Cybermen as the Cyberleader.  Zoe's inquisitive as the Doctor, while Jamie, protective of her as he was with Victoria, is more cautious.  Keirsey would see it as a classic example of a Rational paired with a Guardian.  Her analytical mind and memory comes in useful, as she detects an arithmetic progression in the labryinth.
Bernard Horsfall (the British sailor) would appear in two other Who stories (Planet Of The Daleks, The Deadly Assassin).
Debits:  the Medusa could have been more convincing, i.e. more frightening (q.v. Clash Of The Titans) and the villain isn't exactly effective.  Still, one of the series' greatest moments.",1014508800,20,2137,4.957865168539326
531549,5,6302993628,"This is a must have for any Doctor fan.......ANY Doctor fan......the chemistry that Zoe, Jamie and the Troughton Doctor had was amazing........I'd have to say that while i have my personal favorites as to who is the best Doctor (Tom Baker), that this era has to be the single best chemistry between companions........during the last season, the writers wanted to kill off Jamie, but he refused to be written off when he found out that Troughton was in his last season.......and Troughton fought for him to stay and Frazier (Jamie) was there until season's end.....that's chemistry and loyalty
OK, enuff behind the scenes......here's the story.........the TARDIS  has a ""Panic Button"" that is activated when it is threatened with being overrun with a flow of lava........Troughton warns that there is no telling where they will end up........well, it is outside  time and space, outside of known reality.......they materialize in a plane of exsistance where a single being shapes all reality........they face common (and not so common) mythical beings such as a Minotaur, Unicorn, Guliver and Repunzel (and others from Zoe's world unknown to us Humans).......they get hunted by Toy Soldiers (who have an unnerving methodical rhythmic march that gives them an inhuman quality, similar to Cybermen but without that personality) and strange ""White Robots"" all after they wander out of the TARDIS and no longer know for sure that their TARDIS is the real one or a fictional one created by that (inapropriately named adversary) ""The Master""...........well, Troughton and the Master (which i re-iterate is not THE ""Master"") have to face off with a ""battle of the wits"", with each of them writing reality with their own words........oh, i can't go on (and i wouldn't want to spoil that battle, which is great)........but as far as another review naming this a cross of Dr Who, Twilight Zone and Outer Limits....I'd say that is right on........weirdness and an epic era for Who, thus my ascertion as a must have.....Nuff Said",1009152000,4,2016,5.1432926829268295
531550,5,6302993628,"This 5 part story is a delight to watch. We must be thankful that this is one of the few Patrick Troughton adventures to exist in its entirety. Set in the Land of Fiction, ""The Mind Robber"" is wonderful, whimsical and fantastic (quite literally!). The opening episode is eerie and suspenseful as the plot slowly unfolds. There's a real sense of siege as the TARDIS comes under attack and the scenes in the white void are both surreal and tense. Once the crew reach the Land of Fiction, the story just gets better. Fictional characters such as Gulliver and Rapunzel are full of life and personality (unfortunately so much more than many ""real"" Dr Who characters!) and there are genuinely frightening moments (such as the confrontation with Medusa). The white robots and clockwork soldiers, although they look very simplistic and obviously BBC models/costumes, both exude an air of menace. A story such as this, set in a realm of fiction, could easily have overstepped the mark between fantasy and just plain preposterous - fortunately it doesn't. Great performances and a great story combined!",948153600,11,1092,4.972677595628415
531551,5,6302993628,"It has to be said. This is the best Troughton story from his three year stint as the Doctor. The five episodes( each only twenty minutes for some reason) has content, humour, and loads of atmosphere. I do not want to go  into the story, as it would spoil some entertaining surprises, but wait  till you see the Doctor put his wits up against the mind robber, a war  between two very intelligent people. As usual you will see the satire that  comes from the mouth and facial features of Pat Troughton. I have seen  every Troughton episode that is still in the archives of the BBC and these  five episodes will be the best you see. The giant clock toy soldiers  provide the scary atmosphere in this one. GET IT NOW.  Oh, by the way, the  story which immediately follows this (the Invasion) features the Cybermen  in their last episodes until the Tom Baker era, and has all the excellent  qualities you would expect from a Troughton story, the second best  Troughton story, check it out",944179200,5,983,4.491525423728813
531552,3,6302993628,"This is the first story I saw with Patrick Troughton as the Doctor (apart from the multiple Doctor stories), and it made me a big fan of this  specific TARDIS crew - Second Doctor, Jamie, and Zoe each complement the  others quite nicely.  But I can't help but feel that this story is at least  two episodes too long.  I really do like the first episode - Jamie and Zoe  seeing their homes on the TARDIS scanner, the TARDIS breaking up, etc.  But  I think the author attempted too much in the following episodes.  Gulliver,  Rapunzel, a Jamie with a different face, the Minotaur, etc. etc. all fly  past so quickly you don't really have time to absorb their presence on the  screen.  The story itself was fine - although somehow I expected some other  explanation for the Land of Fiction and its master.  I did have to smile at  the scene with the Doctor being pestered by all the taunting British  schoolchildren though.  It seems the BBC were trying to remake The  Celestial Toymaker from the Hartnell era (of which one episode exists on  the video The Hartnell Years).  All in all, The Mind Robber is not a  classic - but it does deserve a look.",941414400,4,1147,4.4396135265700485

Despite this, it is a wonderful and enjoyable story.",939513600,,347,4.164179104477612

531619,5,6302993628,"I found this series from a list of the best of the original Dr. Who, and I have to agree.

It's a truly original series, that doesn't involve the Daleks (as much as I love them) and instead goes down the road of fantasy.  Which makes sense, as the writer didn't write science fiction.  Gulliver plays a major role, and it even has a unicorn in it (which scares the bejesus out of Jamie).
There is also a very clever replacement for Jamie, as he has to be out for smallpox (of all things).

The special features are definitely worth your time, and really add to the value of this.",1466294400,,579,4.236363636363636
531620,4,6302993628,"OVERVIEW:

Doctor Who: The Mind Robber is yet another fantastic entry in the Patrick Troughton era, with a compelling story that focus' on fairy tale characters coming to life, to great acting (especially from Patrick Troughton), and even some decent action sequences that keep the story moving forward when it starts to loose steam, The Mind Robber is a great addition to any ones Doctor Who Collection!

Episode One:

While episode one tries it's best to keep you glued to the screen, it can get a little tedious at times, which is understandable due to it being the cheapest of the four parts. Most of episode one it is set in the Tardis, with the exception being where the previous story ended, and a huge white stage, so there isn't much to look at in the background, unlike later one in the next three parts, so unless you just love the color white, you won't find much in the set. The special effects aren't anything to talk about, until the end of the episode, which I'll talk about in a second, so like the set, there isn't much to really talk about. The acting is at it's weakest in episode on, but that's only because the first episode was just kinda written so it would have a ""first"" episode, so it wasn't as thought out as the other parts were. Also, it turns out that Fraizer and Wendy had a hard time acting with each other on the set, so that only added to the standard script. But don't get me wrong here, the acting is still great, especially from Patrick (which is of no surprise), so overall, the acting is standard. Like I stated above, episode one is mainly there because it had to be, it tries it's best to set up the story. It does a decent job, but you can only do so much when you throw a episode together just like that, so for the most part, the story is alright. The only exception would be the end of part one, which was an excellent cliffhanger that made you want to see more, awesome job for being able to pull that off. So as you can probably guess, the overall story for episode one was ok, minus the awesome cliffhanger.

Episode Two:

Episode two is, in my opinion, the strongest of the episodes, with all of the main cast at there best, including Patrick (shocker!), the set being simple but effective, and the special effects being what you've come to expect from 1960's Doctor Who. Starting with the set, the set is, like I stated above, simple but effective, so it's not anything special. So overall, the set is standard. Like the sets, the special effects are simple, but effective, so it's nothing special, but it serves it's purpose, so like the set, the special effects are standard. Now up to this point, everything has being standard to ok, but unlike episode one, this story was given a good amount of thought, and it really shows. Episode two's story begins with the fantastic cliffhanger from episode one, then continues to follow the three main actors as they try and reconnect with each other, while at the same time being hunted by the Land's Master. All three actors are at the height of there game, with Patrick being able to show off his acting chops amazingly. The story also includes Hamish Wilson, who played Jamie for an episode and a quarter, the reason being that Fraizer had gotten smallpox right before shooting began for episode two, so the team made him stay, and called Hamish in, and what fantastic decision it was! As soon as Hamish jumps on screen, he instantly jumps into the role with ease, capturing Fraizer's accent and personality practically perfectly, from his hand movements, to how he walks, and even how he acts around the other characters. But the most impressive thing about his performance would be that he only had a couple of hours to study the script, rehearse, and then film, so kudos to him for being able to pull that off! So overall, the episode and acting was at it's height here!

EPISODE THREE:

Episode three does a good job of keeping the story moving, while still bringing something new to the table so things don't get stale. Starting with the set, I think it would be safe to say that the sets are at it's best here, and it shows. Without revealing to much of the story, the sets offer a varity of things to look at, which keeps the story fresh and exciting. So overall, the sets are fantastic. Like the sets in episode three, the special effects are also at it's best, and it's clear from the start. While the story starts off with using some of the techniques the previous part used, it soons branches out into uncharted territory, and succeeds, with some of the effects being able to hold it's own even by todays standards. So as you most likely guessed, the effects are, like the sets, simply fantastic! But while the sets and effects are at there best, the acting and story dies down some, which makes things drag on a tad bit. After reaching the height of what was episode two, episode three tries to contuine bringing a fresh story that keeps you hooked, and while it does fufill that goal, it also creates the problem of there being slightly bland spots littered throughout episode thre. So overall, while the story does start to loose steam, it still manages to keep you watching(Also, like episode one, the cliffhanger here is great, and it keeps you wondering what will happen in episode four). Then there's the acting, which isn't anything major, but is still pretty good. After episode two, the cast continues their adventure to meet the mysterious Master of the Land of Fiction, while facing more of his traps and attempts to trap the trio in his world forever. This is also the episode that has Hamish Wilson stepping down from the role of Jamie, and letting Fraizer return. So basically, it's episode two, but with even more challenging traps and mazes. So while the acting isn't as awesome as episode two, it still manages to keep you ente

EPISODE FOUR:

While episode four looses major steam, and has a disappointing fighting scene, the episode still manages to keep you watching till the credits roll. Starting with the sets, you can instantly tell that the production team tried there best here, with the sets being basic but interesting, with the exception of the Master's lair, which was executed brilliantly. So overall, while the sets are mostly simple, they still manage to spice things up, even if it's only a little. Since this is the last episode of The Mind Robber, the team tried to mesh all of their best effects into episode, and while they do a good job of showing it all off, it still makes you feel a tiny bit underwhelmed. So yeah, that's pretty much it for special effects. Up next is the acting, which by now is the standard stuff we're used to getting. The only new thing they bring was the Master's character, which was up until now, pretty boring. The actor who plays the Master plays him well, being able to act innocent and joyful one minute, and then cold and evil the next. So for the most part, the acting is standard, not counting the Master. Last but not least is the Story, which goes up and down the whole time. There's a lot of interesting elements that go along with this part, but when those episodes aren't in play, the story could get boring. But to spice things up, the team decided to add two different fighting scenes to keep the story going. While the first fight is semi-entertaining, it's also extremely rough around the edges, and it shows. But they do get a free pass due to them only being able to practice the fight for a couple days, and the fact that they could only film the scene once. But where the first scene fails to deliver, the second scene passes with flying colors. Without giving to much away, the fight contains five different fairy tale characters, and a lot of swords. So for the story, while it looses some major steam throughout, it still manages to keep you hooked...barely.",1466121600,,7857,4.539167254763585

Though there are a lot of Troughton episodes missing (would trade some Hartnell ones to get more Troughton) this one is a must get for any fan of the Second Doctor and his companions. There's a reason that Troughton is my favorite Classic Doctor. Even when he doesn't have much of a setting to work with at points, Troughton is still captivating enough to keep one's attention. In addition to that, this serial is a great reminder than a big budget is not needed to come up with a great story. A great adventure with a nice twist.

And whose voice is it that attacks the Doctor's mind?
This 5 part serial is about as outright surreal as Doctor Who ever got, with episode 1 standing out as one of the most unnerving and atmospheric 22 minutes in the show's history...and with one hell of a cliffhanger at that! For me, this is the strongest of the few complete Troughton stories that have survived to the present day. It's full of mystery, resplendent with literary and visual imagination, at turns both hilarious and terrifying, and the cast are clearly having a blast.

Exactly.
The first question I asked a writer friend and fellow Whovian after viewing this one was ""What's the term for the direction perpendicular to special?  I need to know how to describe the point from which this one went meta...""  And that's really the best explanation I can give.  The story starts camptastically special, then makes a hard left turn through ""what-were-they-on?"" trippy before resolving into a mind-bendy metaness that makes everything prior seem to make sense until you actually go back and think about it properly.  Which puts the whole thing right up near the top of the list of episodes I might pull out to illustrate the sheer breadth of variety in early-series writing and why concepts like dinosaurs on spaceships and collapsed timeless history are, while comparably egregious gimmicks, not actually beyond the pale of series canon.

531763,5,6302993628,"This still sticks as one of the strangest and creative stories in DR WHO and it's easy to see why.  The premise of a ""Land of Fiction"" seems like the most waybegone of science fiction, but the concept that humanity's creative force puts out awesome amounts of mental energy is too tempting not to play with!

So, too, thinks the mysterious and very alien minds who control matters in the shadows.  They want that energy for themselves...and they want Earth.

The episode opens with a bang--an active volcano threatens the TARDIS and the Doctor's youth and inexperience shows here--he doesn't know for certain if the lava will damage his ship, and with Jamie's urging, employs a desperate last-minute tactic of sending the ship into ""nowhere.""  This seems to solve the problem for Jamie and Zoe, but the Doctor is terrified.  ""Nowhere"" is something completely out of his experience.  And this is what makes it unique for Troughton.  He remembers being the ""Original Doctor"" in fits and starts, and usually vaguely.  He constantly relies on his predecessor's diary to help puzzle out his problems.  A completely new and unusual problem FRIGHTENS him because he has move into his own ""nowhere"" space and operate from there.  Although he does a lot of growing in his short tenure, this Doctor has very few low points, and this is one of his lowest before THE WAR GAMES.  He doesn't know what to do, but he knows it is a very very bad idea to go outside the TARDIS.  He's gotten a taste of an alien vibration and he does not like it one bit.  The novelization explains why we should all be afraid of vacuums in the most chilling language, but on the screen we just know that this very old, experienced being is out of his depth and he knows it.

The alien mind(s) lure Jamie and Zoe outside showing them what they desire the most:  their homes.  They trick the Doctor out by showing him what he fears: the loss of his companions (a tragic foreshadowing of THE WAR GAMES).  He rescues them but it's all been a ploy.  The TARDIS is under attack, and finally, the Doctor too.  One of the most unforgettable shots is Zoe and Jamie clinging to the console for dear life in the nothingness as the Doctor spins slowly away, unconscious, in his old wooden chair.

And then after that, things get VERY interesting.

Troughton's Doctor never fully regains his composure until he's captured by the Master Computer.  Literally in a box, he is accidentally given the key to rescue them all and he takes the moment with a childish glee.  Up until this point the viewer could easily wonder if the Doctor is so worried because the Land of Fiction looks too much like the Celestial Toyroom for comfort--there is some fanon out there that suggests the Toymaker is responsible for its creation, and the Doctor finds the Toymaker one of the most terrifying of his foes.

Jamie and Zoe's roles are fantastic throughout the show, along with a clever solution for replacing Frazer Hines when he was down with chicken pox.  Wendy Padbury and Frazer Hines do a wonderful job of commentating throughout the show, and it's hard not to laugh when Wendy sees how she and Frazer cruelly (and smirkingly) used the Doctor's worry about them to trap him in the computer.

. . .

Note: mild spoilers below. please don't freak out.
. . .

This five-part adventure is a delightful Doctor Who story in which the Tardis, mechanically crippled and imperiled by a massive lava flow, is flung in desperation outside of reality itself, into a realm where reality becomes fluid and up for grabs. The Doctor and his companions are confronted by an array of fictional characters, controlled by a mysterious entity that is bent on conquering the Doctor and forcing him to live by its rules.

Originally broadcast in 1968, this is one of the few episodes currently available starring actor Patrick Troughton (the second Doctor) who appeared rather panicky and hysterical in comparison to other incarnations. His sidekicks are fun -- as is their late '60s Carnaby Street-ish fashion -- and it's nice to see his sidekick Zoe (played by Wendy Padbury) portrayed as an extremely capable female character.  Particularly juicy is an action scene where she repeatedly judo flips a superpowered opponent -- ala Emma Peel -- forcing him into submission. The story is a pleasant romp with some interesting ontological twists... Highly enjoyable! I wish more of the Troughton-era episodes were available!

531765,3,6302993628,"I got this because it sounded good but primarily because it was cheap, & for once I can see why.  I read that most helpful review by buckbooks before buying this that explained the reason why the first episode felt like filler, but that doesn't excuse how stupid the companions were for wandering off into the void.  Apart from that it was okay, the ending with the TARDIS breaking up was the best part.  The next 2 episodes were truly good, except for one thing: the cowardly Second Doctor.  Seriously, every threat he was faced with he responded with panic.  It got annoying after a while.  If he is like this in his other episodes, he's probably going to be my least favorite Doctor.  I did come to like Jamie though, but Zoe was annoying as proved in the next episode when she activated that alarm (my aunt, who was watching it with me said ""Leela would never do that!"").  Even when she was taking down the Karkus (her best moment here), it was still annoying because the Doctor was cowering from him while she fought him.  I thought to myself ""the Third Doctor would have fought him, smiling.""  Even the Doctor grabs the idiot ball in the last episode when he falls for the trap the villain set for him.  Apart from those somewhat significant annoyances, this was good.  The fictional characters were perfectly cast, and I really liked the riddles & puns.  As long as you don't set your hopes too high, this is a fine story, just not great.",1360108800,,1445,4.469465648854962

531821,5,6302993628,"Many hard core Dr. Who fans say that Patrick Troughton was the best actor to ever play Dr. Who, and they have good reasons for saying that.  The unfortunate thing is that he played Dr. Who in the late 1960s when the quality of scripts he was given was pretty low and the special effects were sometimes laughable.  How he usually did under the circumstances is hard to say because most of the episodes he starred in were destroyed by 1978, but it can be said in some of the surviving footage Troughton is about the only thing worse worth watching. Mind robbers, however, is very easy to like, and might be the best story that ever starred Patrick Troughton.

There is no chance of saying that it just happened, because one of the featurettes on the DVD tells just what the producers of show had to put up with.  The budget was very low and the shooting schedule was very tight.  The Dr. who show is still on the air, but now a days they produce about 14 episodes a year on a very large budget.  The late 1960's they produced about 40 episodes a year, and surviving cast members are justified in complaining that the schedule was terrible, but on this video you would never know that from the finished product.  There are a number of complex action scenes and they all come off very well.

The story is set outside of time and space, and most of the world is an empty white void.  Because it takes place outside of time and space, it possible for fictional characters like Rapunzel, Gulliver and Medusa to appear.  The production company also used old robot costumes that were left over from another show.  The over all visual effect works very well, and you won't waste time waste time analyzing the visuals because the story is very good. Since the plot is set out side of space and time reality has become very flexible.  The characters have to struggle not to believe in these mythical creatures or face their own destruction.  This gives the actors a conflict to face inside of themselves and a chance to act, which as I mentioned Troughton is good at.  I might add that Wendy Padbury also does a good job as Zoe Heriot, who does a lot of the action scenes in this story.  She beats up an imaginary super hero character, and she grabs a key control panel at one point which is critical to the Doctor winning the day. She does all that, and still has us believing that she is the over confident math genius we met in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-Lost-in-Time-Collection-of-Rare-Episodes-The-William-Hartnell-Years-and-the-Patrick-Troughton-Years/dp/B0002OXVF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who - Lost in Time Collection of Rare Episodes - The William Hartnell Years and the Patrick Troughton Years</a>"" episode. She also is is really struggling to keep her grip on reality. The point is that Troughton and Padbury both give wonderful performances, and that is what makes this extra special.

I recommend this for anyone interested in a good story about space ships and robots and aliens.  I think anyone who enjoys Dr. Who will like this story.  I also think that if you have never seen Doctor who, this might not be a bad first story watch.  For most people who are not accustomed to Dr. Who, most the old black and white stories would be hard take, but this story is is very easy to get into.  Dr. Who after all, started in black and white, so why not start watching one of the old black and white episodes.

The DVD contains the 5 episodes that make up the story and three rather good extras.  I mentioned there is an extra about who the story was made.  There is an interesting extra about one of the regular actors in the story, Frazer Hines, and there is a comedy skit about a yeti.  The yeti in question is a monster that appeared in other stories with Patric Troughton as Dr. Who, and the skit is very entertaining whether you know about yeti in Dr. Who or not.

As now, there have been 11 people who played the character of Dr. Who.  Fans refer to the time when an actor played Dr. Who as an era.  This is my favorite from the period the second Doctor Who--Patric Troughton.  I would be willing to argue that it is the best from that era, although there are some other very good stories from that time.",1304294400,,4270,4.627320954907161

And since this story arc includes five episodes, it seemed a good place to view Edward Troughton's Doctor.  The first two of these five episodes, I have to say, were a disappointment.  In fact, it only really picked up when Doctor Who finally confronted the ""villian"" face to face (so to speak) in the fourth episode.  That's when the whole story arc came alive.  Prior to that, Troughton's Doctor struck me as much too timid and cautious. But by the end, it was well worth my time.

What I found interesting is how they managed to take Frazer Hines' unfortunate illness(He had become ill with chickenpox right before filming episode 2.)and made it look like they intentionally changed Jamie from one face to the other then back again.  In the commentary, Frazer Hines does tell how when Zoe slapped Jamie, she clipped his ear and his ear rang for a few minutes and also tells that one of the toy soldiers was, in fact, his older brother, who he asked to be in the episode.

531899,5,6302993628,"Growing up, I viewed very few of Patrick Troughton's adventures as the Doctor.  For this reason, he was always an afterthought in my little ""Who"" world.  After watching a number of his tales, however, he's quickly become one of my favorite incarnations of the good Doctor.  I love his rapport with his companions and anybody else who happens to stumble on to the wobbly sets of ""Doctor Who.""  In this particular adventure, he really shines, making me rank ""The Mind Robber"" as one of the best ""Who"" serials in the entire series' long run.  It starts out with the Doctor, Jamie (Frazer Hines) and Zoe (Wendy Padbury) in a TARDIS that's about to be engulfed by molten lava.  With no real idea as to what will happen to the TARDIS in this state, the Doctor (with a little help from Jamie) executes an emergency exit feature on the TARDIS' console.  Where they end up is nowhere, literally.  They are out of reality, time and space altogether.  Jamie has visions of his home, Scotland.  Zoe sees the city she was raised in.  Zoe, against the Doctor's orders, leaves the safety of the TARDIS to see her home.  What she finds is a void that shows her what she wants to see.  Jamie goes to save her and gets caught up into the visions as well.  Once the Doctor seemingly saves them, all three end up trapped in a world where fiction is reality and riddles help you find your way home.  Who or what is behind this ""nothing"" that has the trio trapped?  Can the Doctor save them?  You'll have to watch to find out.

This tale features some wonderful characters from literature.  From Gulliver to Rapunzel to D'Artagnan, history's best stories get a nod in this engaging adventure written primarily by Peter Ling, who we find from viewing the retrospective, ""Fact Of Fiction,"" questioned his own ability to write science fiction.

This story seemed doomed from the beginning.  Due to unforeseen circumstances, Episode One was thrown together to stretch the adventure into five episodes.  It's actually one of the highlights of the story.  Also, when Frazer Hines became ill, another actor was cast to portray him in one of the episodes.  What's great about this is the rather funny way that a different looking Jamie came to be.  Spare robots from a previous BBC production were used as well.  This story is a shining example of chaos becoming classic.

As far as the actual disc is concerned, the crew at the BBC have outdone themselves once again.  This is an excellent DVD transfer with only a few blemishes visible throughout the episodes.  The audio is wonderful as well.  As with the other classic ""Doctor Who"" DVDs, this one is chock full of special features.  Including the aforementioned retrospective, there's also ""Highlander,"" which looks at the career of the highly likeable Frazer Hines.  There's a fun ""Basil Brush"" sketch featuring the dapper fox and his run-in with the Yeti, a photo gallery, a ""Who's Who"" gallery, excellent audio commentary and an easter egg as well.

This is a great ""Doctor Who"" tale and I highly recommend it to any and every fan of the classic series, the new series or science fiction in general.  Fans of mysteries and thrillers may also like this story.  It's got a fresh and different (for ""Doctor Who"") story, an excellent cast, a solid villain who shares his name with another, legendary arch-villain of the Doctor and even a little bit of classic literature education.  It's simply wonderful.  Highly recommended.

And one other completely chauvinist note:  Although the Doctor has had his share of beautiful companions, I must admit that few of them have ever looked as smokin' hot as Wendy Padbury as Zoe in this particular adventure.",1203292800,5,3672,4.75
531900,5,6302993628,"Well, with the first episode at least. Even though Peter Ling (the author) didn't write this episode, as it was a last minute addition, it has to be the best of the five. A subtly creepy opening as The Doctor is forced to take the TARDIS out of time, space and reality, in order to escape being smothered by a volcano (from the previous adventure), and a mysterious voice inside their heads beckoning them to come out... but where do you go when there's... nothing?

The next four episodes are no slouch either. ""Out there"" is a land of fiction, characters from books such as Gullivers Travels and Rapunzel, but even creatures from mythology, Medusa, unicorns, etc. How do you escape Medusa? How do you escape a stampeding unicorn? When it doesn't exist?

And I don't want to hear any more talk about Rose being a revolutionary companion who ""doesn't just scream."" The new series was NOT the first to have a proactive companion who wasn't a cardboard cutout. Zoe is fantastic in this, taking down a futuristic superhero (Karkus) that she read about in her own time, and even saving the day as she destroys the computer controlling the fiction world.

An easy recommend. Patrick Troughton seems incapable of having a bad serial, and it's not just due to the writers. The Second Doctor's friends seem to have an impish excitement about each adventure, and that's conveyed through to you in every scene. And when you're watching TV to escape, that's almost impossible to resist.",1198281600,7,1475,4.75390625
531901,5,6302993628,"Maybe it has something to do with the late '60's, but this has to be one of the most surreal, tripped-out ""Doctor Who"" storylines ever. The weirdness starts with the Tardis (that ever undependable vehicle) getting stranded in a blank void outside of space and time, and the Doctor's companions Jamie and Zoe getting lured out into this vast expanse of nothing by hallucinations of their homelands. It gets stranger still when the Tardis flies apart into pieces and the characters are left clinging to the detached console, whirling in an eerily silent slow-motion spin. But all of this is only a prelude to the truly bizarre, as the Doctor, Jamie, and Zoe must then find their way through a labyrinth, challenged along the way by verbal games, mental puzzles, and (most of all) fictional characters from literature and mythology. Basically, the three of them seem to be stuck in an English Lit major's fever dream.

In the end there turns out to be a reasonably solid science fiction basis for all of it, of course. Still, this is a remarkably imaginative and unusual tale that plays around with the border between illusion and reality in intriguing and yet utterly entertaining ways. That along with the Doctor's infectious wit (Patrick Troughton is great as usual) and the wonderful chemistry between the characters all make this a rather understated but fine example of ""Doctor Who"" at its best.",1170806400,,1398,4.89873417721519

How irritating that the Beeb did not archive these earlier stories-- the 2 episodes we have of ""The Faceless Ones"" are wonderful, in addition to some other tidbits from an underappreciated era of Doctor Who.

Well-paced, mind-bending, and some great run-around!  What more does a fan of the programme ask?

531904,4,6302993628,"""The Mind Robber"" was initially derided by Who critics as mere fantasy when, in fact, the story has a solid science fiction foundation: the brain of an unseen alien intelligence must be fed by the musings of a pulp-fiction writer imprisoned in its service. Turn on the commentary text and many of the production problems that contributed to the unique nature of this story are revealed.

First, the original four-episode story was stretched to five because the previous story, ""The Dominators,"" didn't offer enough material to pad out its planned six episodes and was cut back to five. So the added first installment of ""The Mind Robber"" had to be improvised on a shoestring budget from existing props and sets. The ""great white void"" which so distinguishes this story was created specifically because ""nothing"" was cheap to depict.

Next, actor Frazer Hines contracted chicken pox before shooting on the second episode could begin and had to be temporarily written out of the story. A substitute actor was cast to play Jamie that week with a clever subplot written in to explain his changed appearance.

The story, which may seem an incomprehensible jumble at first, actually follows a very logical set of rules exploring the nature of fiction vs. reality. The storyteller, for example, dictates the action, so the Doctor can change the story by writing it himself, but if he refers to himself in the narrative he will become a fictional character and therefore cease to exist.

The use of literary figures such as Lemuel Gulliver and Cyrano de Bergerac harks back to one of the series' original objectives, to serve as an educational children's program. Gulliver, for instance, speaks in dialogue lifted mostly from Jonathan Swift's novel. So kiddies who think they're watching a low-budget sci-fi serial are actually getting an introductory course in English lit.

This story is a sterling example of the resourcefulness and solid acting that made Doctor Who, particularly the early episodes, such a charming TV series.

531905,5,6302993628,"The Land of Fiction endures as one of ""Doctor Who""'s more memorable locales, even after nearly 40 years.  Part of this is due to the fact that ""The Mind Robber"" is one of the few Patrick Troughton stories surviving in its entirety, and thus meriting multiple airings on US PBS stations for most of the last 20 years.  I'd like to think the story would endure even if, like ""The Celestial Toymaker"", the master tapes had been wiped.

At the outset of ""The Mind Robber"", the Doctor is forced to remove the TARDIS from ""real space"", only to have the time machine materialize ""nowhere""... or, more specifically, the Land of Fiction, first seen as a forest of words populated by clockwork robots, evocative British schoolchildren... and Lemuel Gulliver.  The sinister-voiced Master of the Land tracks their every move, and throws ever more fictional characters into their path.  If it can be said that the middle of the five stallments drags down a bit under repetition (Episodes 2 and 3 have identical cliffhangers), it can also be said that the final episode remains an intriguing battle of wits between the Doctor and the (other) Master, using the computer that powers the Land of Fiction to stage jousting battles between Lancelot and... Cyrano de Bergerac.  This is great stuff!

The DVD extras provide the standard amount of comprehensive production detail.  When troubles with the preceding story, the deadly dull ""Dominators"", forced ""The Mind Robber"" to expand by one episode, a last-minute intervention by script editor Derrick Sherwin (a sort of forgotten figure in the DW production pantheon) produced a still-memorable interlude.  Not only do we get an eerie white void locale that prefigures the TARDIS's abudction into the Land of Fiction (a white void digitally inserted by the DVD production team as the backdrop for the interviews on the making-of feature), but we also get extended looks at each of the TARDIS regulars.

The DVD features are not the strongest, but they're still solid.  While the text commentary is bursting at the seams with trivia -- not the standard fare reciting dull lists of production dates and guest actors' TV credentials -- it does spoil the audio commentary and the making-of feature, because the same anecdotes are revealed in all three places.  The audio commentary is a bit slow and rambling; director David Maloney gives running commentary on the actors' teeth, for some reason.  The interview with Frazer Hines, who played Jamie opposite the Patrick Troughton Doctor for all but one story in his reign, is rather good.  I learned here, for example, that the production team hoped for Jamie to stick around to travel with the Third Doctor.  That would have done interesting things to the Earth-bound Season 7!

For US audiences, the ""Basil Brush"" sketch included as the obligatory ""gag"" feature is just plain bizarre: a dog with a shrill laugh and a penchant for bad puns meets up with some friendly Yeti in the Himalayas.  There's a song, too.  I have the unfortunate feeling that my five year-old nephew would enjoy that far too much...",1126742400,,3084,4.9437984496124034
531906,5,6302993628,"The penultimate pair of releases for 2005 in the Doctor Who catalogue brings together two stories made almost a decade apart from two different eras of the Doctor's long running saga. But both The Mind Robber and The Horror of Fang Rock do have a connection is so much as they come from troubled periods of the show's history.

The older adventure, The Mind Robber, was the second story from Patrick Troughton's final season as the intrepid Time Lord. Having spent three years in the role during the era when the show was almost continually on air, Troughton was tiring of the punishing schedule of turning out a weekly episode and in addition the show itself was considered by the BBC to have run it's natural course. Ratings were beginning to dip and viewer satisfaction with the series was waning. And yet, despite the rather lacklustre atmosphere surrounding the show, The Mind Robber proved to be one of the most innovative and original stories ever created for the show. Set in the world of fiction, this story really highlights the creativity of the production team and is a very unusual and brave attempt to do something well beyond the normal sci-fi genre. Visually, the show is astounding and even with the very limited budget, studio space, monochrome broadcast and technology; the land of fiction created by the designers is really very effective. Introducing characters from fiction that can only speak the lines of their text and conjuring up disturbing images and problems for the Doctor and his companions to solve, the show really is quite complex and works very well.

That's not to say there aren't challenges. Originally commissioned as a six-part story, the writer struggled to make it barely fill the amended requirement of four episodes. At the last minute, a fifth episode was needed, so the show's script editor (and later producer) Derrick Sherwin had to tag on another stand-alone episode to open the adventure, using nothing but the regular cast and the Tardis set. Subsequently, each episode runs for well under the normal twenty-five-minute length, with episode five coming in under seventeen minutes in length. At least the tedium of some of the longer six-parters is avoided! Frazer Hines was struck down with chicken pox before episode two recording could begin and producers came up with a truly brilliant way of replacing him with another actor for an episode and a half. Plus there are the usual goofs, continuity errors and fluffs that make the black and white era of Doctor Who so charming, but all in all, it really works very well.

The same can be said for The Horror of Fang Rock, the companion release made almost a decade later and featuring Tom Baker as the fourth Doctor. Opening the show's sixteenth season, Baker's fourth, this story was penned by Terrance Dicks, who although an infrequent writer for the show, as the script editor on the show from the final Patrick Troughton days through the entire Jon Pertwee era, he is probably the most prolific writer associated with the show. Always able to pen a script at short notice, this story was pulled together in record time when his earlier script (about vampires) fell through. Set entirely in a lighthouse and it's surrounding rocks, the claustrophobia of the piece is wonderfully atmospheric. Rather `Agatha Christie' like in it's set up, the story deals with the sudden one-by-one murders of the characters as the Doctor and his companion Leela try to work out the alien menace attacking the crew.

Although the season opener, this was the second story recorded in this block and is the first to go out under the production aegis of Graham Williams. Williams had been brought into the show when Philip Hinchcliffe had moved on after three years at the helm and arguably had taken Doctor Who to new heights and overseen it's most successful period. His reign had been deemed too controversial by the BBC and Hinchcliffe left the show on a ratings and critical high but not with much BBC support. Newcomer Williams had a very different view of the show and seemed to prefer slapstick and whimsy to the darker production style of Hinchcliffe. Williams certainly encouraged the playful side of Tom Baker who never took the role seriously from this point forwards and became more and more outrageous in his performance and dominant of the show. But this was early days and is certainly superior to much of what came later.

The restoration of the master tapes is as always flawless, with the earlier story being ""vidfired"" to recreate the original broadcast quality. Both stories have a number of extras included on the disc, most notably two truly interesting retrospectives of Terrance Dicks and the making of The Mind Robber. The commentaries are perhaps not as enjoyable as other releases, particularly for the earlier story featuring Frazer Hines & Hamish Wilson (Jamie), Wendy Padbury (Zoe) and director Michael Ferguson. It must be hard for the crew to recall what is happening almost forty years after the story was made, so this is forgivable, and Dicks, Louise Jameson (Leela) and a guest actor do a good job on the later story. Other extras about the careers of Frazer Hines and Paddy Russell are also quite interesting. The most bizarre inclusion is a sketch from another BBC classic ""The Basil Brush Show"" which seems to have no relevance at all to the Mind Robber or the era, other than it features a Yeti, seen in Doctor Who a year before this release. But it's a silly piece of nonsense that's certainly highly enjoyable.

All in all, a good pair of releases, but with only three more Troughton stories in the archives available, I think we'll be looking for more classic Tom Baker releases to fill the gaps in future issues.",1126310400,3,5740,4.8520408163265305
531907,5,6302993628,"I was waiting for this one to come out on DVD because I consider ""The Mind Robber"" to be one of the best Doctor Who stories from the 60's.  It is more fantasy than Science-Fiction because the writer, Peter Ling, said he didn't know anything about Sci-Fi when he was contracted to write it.  But you wouldn't know it after viewing it.  The idea of the Doctor and his companions caught in a world of fiction, where well-known characters such as Gulliver or Rapunzel can only say (more or less) the dialogue that they were given by their authors is certainly intriguing.

This one also overcame a few challenges during the recording of the show in clever ways.  For one thing Frazer Hines (Jamie) contracted Chicken Pox and had to take an extended leave from the studio.  Since the story was already a bit unusual, they worked in a section where another actor would play Jamie for the duration, without affecting the overall storyline.  Also, at the last minute, the BBC needed a 5 part serial rather than a 4-part serial, so the entire first episode was concocted to build up to the rest of the story.

I was already aware of some of these things but the Special Features cover it in more detail.  Watching the features was very enlightening.  Since I have seen every classic Doctor Who episode multiple times I very much enjoy watching these DVD's with the Information Text and Commentary turned on.  There's a good lineup of commentators from the original series.",1126137600,3,1463,4.653696498054475
531908,5,6302993628,"This is just fantastic! IT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD! I love those old characters that I have forgotten about it, all those ""old world"" characters. I love the story so much, it's almost objectional to call those characters ""fiction!"" To me it's real! :D To me, Patrick knows how to have fun and have a good time in this adventure.

The guy who wrote this was apparently his first sci-fi story he'd ever written.

I've never seen a tardis explode before! INCREDIBLE! Yet, all the action is here. Great story. Great characters, very entertaining and you feel like you apart of the story as well.

I wish they continued to make stories like this in post 1960's Doctor Who... but they didn't.

This is a classic story.

If you love Doctor Who, you should get this story now!!! It's one of the greatest out there! If you don't, you are missing out bad!!!!!!!!!!",1112918400,5,850,4.529411764705882
