2752665,1,B000N26QJ4,"I'm not a fan of Natalie Portman (she can't act, she can't act here either) so I really wanted to like this movie. It has a naturally inert or sluggish moving story without any tension or build-up.  It has the most absurd and drudging compilation of frames.

The first scene is Natalie Portman's spoiled face, crying, for ten dormant minutes.  Natalie Portman is an American with a Jewish history, she is in Hanna's car.  Hanna is an Israeli car driver, devoid of any sensation and remarkedly slow in brain movement.  Toss in an apathetic Palestinian woman.

Free Zone (2005) brings together three boring women, from three drudging cultures, who live in three tedious countries, involved in three hazardous times.  Anyone unfamiliar with the fascist military power politics of the Israeli occupation may find this film confusing.  Israel is a military occupation force in Palestine.

The movie's message is unclear and deliberate.  Watch it if you enjoy markedly slow movement in cinema and like departing on very long, boring car rides with overindulgent Natalie Portman that lead to pointless destinations with two other devoid women.",1280707200,2,1136,5.125
2752666,4,B000N26QJ4,"This is a good movie with some important Mid East understanding.  It's worth a look if the Mid East concerns you.

Natalie Portman is Natalie Portman, and there is nowhere to go from there.

She was born in Isreal, and her heart is in this movie.",1231891200,6,246,4.304347826086956
2752667,2,B000N26QJ4,"I could not make much sense of this movie. All the stars go to Alberstein's beautiful song ""Hada Gadia""",1197590400,,103,4.473684210526316
2752668,3,B000N26QJ4,"For this reviewer, Free Zone was a film to be appreciated in an artistic sense, though not necessarily enjoyed. Writer/Director Amos Gitai (director of the excellent film Kadosh) does some interesting things, but it is hard to be moved by the film as a whole. In the film, chance brings together three women from different sides of an entrenched conflict...a Jewish Israeli, a Palestinian, and an American...for a journey to the Free Zone, an economic free area rife with shady business deals and, ironically, a fertile ground for intercultural interaction. A lengthy, emotional opening scene depicts Rebecca (Natalie Portman) sobbing and gazing out into a dusty, chaotic Jerusalem against a stirring rendition of the Passover song ""Chad Gadya."" The song has been adapted as a lament over the endless chain of violence, its tension building in rising crescendos. Later, we learn that Rebecca has jumped into the cab driven by Hanna, the Israeli character, out of a desperate desire to leave the country after her Israeli fianc confesses to raping a Palestinian woman while on military duty. The film is very nonlinear, and will not appeal to those who like their movies to have a discernible plot and to end with a clear resolution or catharsis. Most of the movie takes place inside Hanna's cab, where a slow dialog is juxtaposed with dreamlike flashbacks. Because of the dreamlike quality and the minimal background offered about the characters, the movie is hard to follow, and I found myself missing out on the more evocative scenes because I was too busy trying to figure out what was going on.

Although Free Zone has a lot of potential and contains some moments of insight, what detracts from the film is its attempt to combine two incompatible genres: the art film and the political film. The political side of the film tries to create a metaphor with each of the characters, whose interactions represent a particular interpretation of the conflict, while the art side embraces ambiguity and is not meant to be ""interpreted"" at all. The fusion of the two genres leads to confusion, because the viewer is unsure whether to look for the film's underlying ""message"" or to simply allow the disjointed images to filter into the subconscious.",1193788800,,2243,4.981333333333334
2752669,2,B000N26QJ4,"This film is relatively boring, simply put. You are basically watching Natalie Portman being driven around Israel and Jordan for the first half of the film. I didn't think that her Hebrew was as flawless as the press/pr would lead you to believe either. The film is in Arabic, Hebrew and English.  I love seeing foreign language films but this dvd is annoying because the subtitle button is very tricky to use. Hiam Abbas is beautiful and talented and breaths some fresh air into this halfway through but not enough to save it.  Natalie Portman is not as annoying as she usually is with her overexposed and affected way but she is completely ineffective here.  I gave the film an extra star because it offers a safe way to do a road trip around the Middle East, i.e. by being able to watch it from the safety of your couch.  It is kind of interesting to be driving along and suddenly see signs pointing toward the ominous destinations that Americans are fearful of having to visit, i.e. Iraq, Syria, etc. And much of the film is spent in a car reading road signs.",1185580800,2,1063,4.492227979274611
2752670,1,B000N26QJ4,"Considering all the positive press surrounding this film, I had high expectations. I ended up disappointed. I could barely stay awake - and the movie's only 90 minutes long. The much-ballyhooed opening shot of Natalie Portman is underwhelming. Six minutes of her crying, with a soundtrack like a Middle East version of ""I Know An Old Lady..."" left me shaking my head. The only good thing about that opening scene is that there are only about 84 minutes to go! I didn't find any of the three main characters very engaging, and I didn't find the cliched ""cultures clash, try to get along, and ultimately end up bickering again"" motif particularly enlightening. The packaging says the movie is 93 minutes long; I was actually glad the credits started rolling after about 85 minutes.",1172448000,3,779,4.864661654135339
8173990,1,B000N26QJ4,"As others wrote, very disappointing. Lack of plot and incorrect targeting of Israel about its self defense in 1967 make this a very poor movie. I wish we had learned from the low rating.",1525564800,,186,4.5

8173993,1,B000N26QJ4,Natalie Portman and Amos Gitai really disappoint.  Perhaps they were too anxious to make a politically correct (left wing) movie.,1459209600,,129,5.45
8173994,5,B000N26QJ4,"This movie for sure is not suitable for everyone but I like it cause it gave me the feeling, without knowing Israel or Jordan , that it took me into the mood of this location and the people there.
The landscapes and locations shown are impressive and oppressive and in my eyes not really beautiful.
The pictures come over quite experimental as well as the very reduced plot.
The first scene with Natalie crying is downright err... special but in connection with this song Had Ghadia by Chava Alberstein which I liked most with French subtitles it is like a wonderful figurehead for the whole movie. And I think its supposed to be.
The cast as I see it is extraordinary good and all three women contribute to this movie in a way you can't do better.
I bought this DVD (used, OmU with german subtitles,rare but nevertheless cheap) because I want to see every movie Natalie was in.
That doesn't mean that I will give five stars for all of her movies... definitely not! There are several which I don't like or where I ask myself: Why did she sign to that ?

This movie however (watched in original English/Hebrew) did impress me very much in a positive way without me being able to explain that precisely. It comes from the heart... Somehow I tend to believe that I understand why Natalie signed for this one...
Ok I admit it, I adore her...

Sadly my special rare copy  with German subtitles came without any additional material and without any booklet in the box.",1377129600,,1461,4.526515151515151

8173996,1,B000N26QJ4,"This movie was poor in acting (except for Natalie, she was brilliant as always) and quality. It didn't seem to have any real plot or any depth what-so-ever. Just save yourself the disappointment and stay away from this movie. =P",1348963200,,228,4.725
8173997,2,B000N26QJ4,"This 2006 Israeli film certainly has good acting.  It stars Natalie Portman as an American in Israel who has just broken up with her fianc.  She's in a cab and crying a lot. The cab driver, an Israeli woman played by Hanna Lesko, is on her way to Jordon to recover a debt owed her husband.  The American woman convinces Hanna to take her along.  Hanna's quite a strong personality and as the two women go into Jordon, we get a chance to see the way of life - the checkpoints, the distrust, the dry and unforgiving landscape.  Eventually they meet Hiam Abbass, a Jordanian woman who works for the man who owes Hanna's husband $30,000.  None of these women trust each other but eventually they bond.

Basically it is a film about the clash of cultures and the hardships on both the Israelis and the Jordanians.  I think the film paints a good picture of life in these countries.  The acting is excellent too.  But the story is so confused that it is hard to follow the plot and  I actually revisited some parts of this film in order to figure out what was happening. I never did figure it out.  Sorry, but I just can't recommend it.",1311811200,2,1130,4.354066985645933
8173998,2,B000N26QJ4,"I am a huge Natalie Portman fan but I could not get into this movie. The most annoying part is when they overlap two, sometimes three transparent scenes at one time making it difficult to even look at. It hurt my eyes. The opening scene where Natalie Portman is crying seemed overly forced, unnatural, and unnecessary. Additionally, I love watching movies with subtitles. The only part that is subtitled is when they are speaking a different language. I am glad that I bought it, but I will probably not watch it again.",1311292800,,519,4.6521739130434785
8173999,4,B000N26QJ4,"I've been on a run of great movies out of Israel (more on that later), and as a result of Amazon's helpful feature ""if you liked this, we might recommend that to you"", I fell upon this movie.

""Free Zone"" (93 min.; originally released in 2005) is at its most basic, an unconventional road movie. Rebecca (Natalie Portman) has just broken up with her finace and is in a cab to get away from it all. The initial 7-8 minutes of the movie is just a close-up of Portman, clearly in distress trying to cope with the break-up (while credits are rolling and ""Had Gadia"", a traditionak Passover song, is playing. It is one of the most amazing openings of a movie I have seen in a long time. The cab driver is Hanna (played by Hanna Laslo), and as it turns out, Hanna needs to go to the Free Zone near the Jordan-Israeli border to collect some money that is owed to her husband. In the Free Zone, they meet up with Laila (Hiam Abbas), who is the contact person for collecting the money. You'll have to see for yourself how it all plays out. This is a slow-moving film, which is fine by me but not for anyone in a hurry. I thought Natalie Portman gave another outstanding performance. Hanna Laslo won Best Actress award at the 2005 Canned Film Festival, where this movie made quite a splash.

As already mentioned, I've had the good fortune of catching a number of really engaging movies out of Israel the last couple of months, including Lemon Tree, Or My Treasure, For My Father, Seven Minutes in Heaven, and of course last Fall's theatrical release Lebanon. I can now add ""Free Zone"" to that list of ""recommended"" movies.",1298160000,4,1613,4.427609427609427
