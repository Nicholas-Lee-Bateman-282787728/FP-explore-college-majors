4338156,4,B004EPYZCQ,"I randomly caught the first few minutes of this show when switching between channels and it immediately dawned on me to set up my DVR for the season. I'm so happy I did, with a virtually perfect performance by Laura Dern, it seems apparent why she was so passionate about the show being made she produced it herself. The portrayal of a central character who, to me anyway, sends the viewer in between moments of complete admiration and love for the character to moments of complete horror and complete discomfort. Casting a character who causes such varied states of emotion in a view is risky at best, as evidenced by the lackluster ratings of the show, but Dern's much deserved Golden Globe win may give this understated and ultimately beautiful show the second chance it deserves. I'll sure as hell be there for season two.",1328054400,58,826,4.703448275862069
4338157,5,B004EPYZCQ,I LOVE this series- it's my hands down favorite show! It is written so well and the mood of the series is wonderful- I cannot wait for more.,1327622400,29,140,4.035714285714286

4338194,3,B004EPYZCQ,I like how open the main actress is and how likeable. What I find unrealistic is everyone at the corporation hates her and make fun of her. I don't find that funny or realistic. If you have an affair with a boss and yell at him for taking your job away and labeled crazy cause your sticking up for yourself is outrageous. Everybody in this show has such fake character. The main woman plays her character perfectly. I keep watching because of her,1522454400,,446,4.385542168674699
4338195,5,B004EPYZCQ,"This was so much fun to watch. One of my favorite series ever, next to Mad Men and Real Humans. Laura Dern & Mike White are both just fabulous.",1522368000,,143,3.9655172413793105
4338196,5,B004EPYZCQ,I actually really loved this. You have to hold on-through some moments I thought I may be hate watching or the perfectionist that has to get through a series but....I ended up loving it and it made me think about so much.,1521763200,,221,4.285714285714286
4338197,1,B004EPYZCQ,"I make a point of avoiding clueless drama queens in real life, so watching this show is the opposite of entertainment, for me.  I watched it for the cast, which is great.  But the characters were objectionable and the story was boring.",1521417600,,235,4.571428571428571
4338198,2,B004EPYZCQ,"Unfortunately  couldn't finish, it was not my style,
Enlightened feels too lightweight to work as a short drama, and too clumsy in its attempts at humor to work that way.",1521158400,,170,4.666666666666667
4338199,2,B004EPYZCQ,"I tried. I really did. I suffered through 3 episodes and bowed out. Way to uneventful and boring for me. The main character is annoying and it's painful to watch every interaction she has with co workers and her own mother. Sorry, this was extremely lame and boring.",1520208000,,266,4.5625
4338200,1,B004EPYZCQ,"A flaky, lazy, selfish person learns nothing at all every single episode. She thinks she's ""enlightened"" and that she knows how to be happy, then goes on to be miserable everywhere. Watch her be useless at a job where everyone else works hard and ""take on"" a corporation by using everyone she meets as if they were just pieces on a checker board (wouldn't be chess pawns, because I'm certain she would be too lazy to learn to play). Don't you love listening to a grown woman whine to her mother all the time, then complain about her life that she is solely responsible for ruining. You will want to quit watching, but simultaneously be hoping that someone hides her body in the floorboards. However, if you like watching a horrible person win at being horrible to hardworking individuals, then this show might be for you.",1519603200,,821,4.63013698630137

4338238,2,B004EPYZCQ,"Annoying. The premise of the show seemed promising but it was a huge let-down. The (scarce) high points are repetitive and development of the main character is stagnant. The other characters suddenly change according to the narrative. Eh, not worth the time wasted.",1518566400,,265,5.186046511627907

4338241,4,B004EPYZCQ,"I like this show and Amy's random bought of potty mouth.  I like cursing when you aren't expecting it.  It's funny when it's thrown in at the right time but not constant.  Like when she spilled her coffee and told her Mom to suck a blank blank.  I really can't stand Amy's ex.  I'm in general not a fan of ANY Wilson.  He is not as painful to watch as Owen Wilson, but still not my favorite actor.  I did like how Tyler and Molly Shannon's character got back together.  Tyler deserved some love in his life.  I think all in all it's an entertaining show, despite it being ""too much"" at times.",1514851200,,592,4.168141592920354

4338243,2,B004EPYZCQ,"I guess it would be too ""on the nose"" to call it Deluded, and calling it Enlightened is nicely ironic. I suppose I might find this funny, except that I have known a couple of women who are exactly like this, and they piss me off far too much to find this funny. It is vaguely interesting though. But the way it is shot makes me wonder if people like this would not see what an idiot the character is, and would take it as some kind of justification for their own nonsense. Still, it is compelling enough that I did not just stop watching after the second episode, when I realized it was not going anywhere else.",1513814400,,611,4.186440677966102
4338244,5,B004EPYZCQ,Great series!,1513641600,,13,6.0
4338245,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Gotta say, the first episodes of this show rubbed me the wrong way. The main character is oblivious to how she effects others. She gets involved in this instant cheesy spirituality that seems superficial. The makes cringe-worthy decisions throughout But as her story evolves the characters and what they are going through get deeper and more and more interesting. Her fight with her inner demons, and her baggage as well as her fight with a soulless corporate America get inner-woven into a beautiful whole. Im glad I gave it a chance and watched the first two seasons.",1513468800,3,569,4.876288659793815
4338246,1,B004EPYZCQ,"I couldn't make it past the third episode. I hate all of the characters so far, except her mom makes me laugh. I can't understand why she would try so hard to change herself yet go back to the same job, and try to get back together with her ex-husband, and her boss who is obviously a jerk. She is a great actress but so far I don't see that she can find herself in this role, or figure out what she is supposed to be doing. All of the reviews are either love it or hate it, and I have to say I'm with the haters.",1513468800,,513,3.803738317757009

4338288,5,B004EPYZCQ,Loved this show and gained a new respect for Laura Dern. She is now one of my favorite actors. I thought the writing for this was incredible and wished it would have continued. It was different yet relatable and I couldn't wait to see the next episode each week.,1512086400,,262,4.36734693877551

4338293,1,B004EPYZCQ,"In my opinion Laura Dern is a great actress.  She is in this series, but the poor writing and story plot could not save her.  Watched half of it and then suddenly lost interest.  Was expecting it to hold its own or get better as it went on, but it kept getting worse.  Typical bad HBO fare.",1510790400,,290,4.035087719298246

4338296,5,B004EPYZCQ,Loved this. Still can't believe this was cancelled. One of the best written and acted show I've seen in a long time. Sad only two seasons! Wish another network would get this going fora couple more seasons.,1509321600,,206,4.594594594594595

4338350,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Laura Dern shines as this complex character Amy.
Confused, alone, wanting to be someone more than the ordinary.
At times you just want to look away from her. Her mistakes are so embarrassing.
Accolades of praise to Mike White's scripts.
I watched this series first with hopes that Big Little Lies would be well received. It wasn't by me.
What is Hollywood thinking??? Laura Dern's transformation in BLLs from a crazed mother to a best friend was not a believable transition.
The wife beating, rape and murder of BLLs was not something so interesting to watch.
Enlightened's written story along with Laura Dern's superb acting are Emmy winners for me.
One even came to appreciate her greasy boss.",1509148800,,695,4.898305084745763
4338351,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Just got around to watching this years after it was out.  Laura Dern plays a great lead.  Awesome to see Molly Shannon in there as well!  A good cast of actors that you ""know from somewhere"".  Story was not as predictable as most movies.  Not a thriller or a Romcom.  I enjoyed the content and the character interplay.  Great ending to see James Rebhorn.  Almost put in a spoiler.  Spoke to environmental issues, but didn't get preachy about them in the same sense as ""Day After Tomorrow"" or ""Geostorm"".  Just spoke to being an activist of any issue you believe in.",1508976000,,565,4.5049504950495045
4338352,5,B004EPYZCQ,"My kind of show!  Positive and spiritual, yet not in a corny way.
The character is not really supposed to be likable.  This is an annoying person with a lot of issues who is trying to change, which is a slow and long journey.  This show demonstrates this very well.  There are many life lessons to be learned.",1508630400,2,309,4.275862068965517
4338353,5,B004EPYZCQ,"I am thoroughly enjoying this series.  Great writing, great acting.  I  laugh, I think, I ""feel"".  Cool show",1508371200,,108,4.833333333333333

4338356,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Amy is so awful that its so awesome! Could not look away from this train wreck... she is annoying, a hot mess, totally oblivious to her toxic behavior.... and I hate to admit that some of her traits are totally relatable.",1507248000,2,221,4.414634146341464
4338357,5,B004EPYZCQ,"One of the BEST shows I have ever watched. No joke. There is something so profound, and deep about this show. The acting is incredible, with a powerful storyline that every human being can relate to - the rat race of the world, our impact - our insecurities/etc. Laura Dern is AMAZING in this, I loved her so much - I binge watched both seasons I feel so empty without it. WATCH THIS SHOW you will not regret it !!!",1506902400,,415,4.2
4338358,5,B004EPYZCQ,"I loved this show. I think we all know someone like Amy, or perhaps have felt some of the ways she feels in certain circumstances. The negative reviews just lead me to conclude what I usually conclude... not every show is for everybody. I found the writing and acting to be superb. I will watch it all again someday, I'm sure.",1506211200,,326,4.360655737704918
4338359,5,B004EPYZCQ,"SO well written, cast, directed and acted. I loved all the characters and how they developed over the 2 seasons. The fact that there was no season 3 didn't detract from the story. It was a layered tale, well-told and, to me, complete. I  will watch it again sometime to see what I might have missed.  The Initial awkwardness is amazingly accurate and the way it portrays how we all flail around in the dark trying to find our way. Corporate strangulation is laid bare on a personal level. Very cool. The narration speeches are beautiful.  I was surprised to find it was done in 2011. I thought it newer and was riding the wave of the hope for change that we all felt during the election campaigns last year, perhaps. I loved it. Nice to see life reflected in art. Be the change!",1505952000,2,778,4.388888888888889
4338489,1,B004EPYZCQ,"Its terrible.  I see other reviews saying the show is only for women.  I am a woman, and the show is still terrible.  I appreciate what they're trying to say - about being positive and stuff, but that crap doesn't work in the real world when its anchored in fluff.  To pull that off in the real world takes more than the surface level insights and petty concerns illustrated in this garbage show.

I watched 4 episodes in and couldn't waste anymore of my life.",1505606400,4,460,4.364705882352941

4338493,4,B004EPYZCQ,"As someone who is a spiritual life coach and studies subjects which fall into the cross hairs of science and spirituality, I was a bit nervous beginning this series. I have to say that they did hit something on the head, in that, it often does feel when walking a spiritual path that their are many many roadblocks no matter how zen you are or how consistently you manifest. This is due to our karma and our mental patterns getting in the way of what it is we desire, which is Amy's problem most certainly. The highest spiritual points for Amy appear to be when she is seeing the beauty of life itself. Which is great, however, I hope this character eventually finds success. It is possible to walk a spiritual life and be a kind, respectful as well as financially stable person. I respect it when spirituality is made fun of because we must always be able to laugh at ourselves, but I also think that if the writers are connected with their spirituality, they should realize the platform they have to better portray the positive outcomes which ARE possible. If it is not in the cards for Amy to get the success she seeks, I wish she would see a first hand example of someone else who has accomplished their spiritual goals.",1504828800,,1224,4.46875
4338494,5,B004EPYZCQ,Excellent show. I wish Netflix would have picked the show up after HBO cancelled it.,1504656000,,84,4.666666666666667
4338495,1,B004EPYZCQ,Thought I would give this a try. Definitely made for women. I watched half of the pilot. It did not get better. Nothing here for the male of the species.,1504310400,2,153,4.133333333333334

I guess there are alot of women out there that identify with this main character. Pretty scary to say the least. I can't believe they wrote in such a pathetic character. It was painful to watch the first season. How does someone watch a show where the main character is so delusional? ugh, That's hours of my life I won't get back. Tremendously idiotic show and worthless plot. how can a show be called enlightened when the main character is continuously a rebel without a clue. PLEASE...do not waste your time watching something so useless.",1503705600,2,660,4.601694915254237
4338498,2,B004EPYZCQ,"By the 5th episode of season 1, despite a few bright spots, I was bored to tears.

Also aggravated by the writers' stupidity. The series begins with the heroine tearing off her bumper. Later, when her car won't start, she repeatedly rags on her mother for refusing to lend hers. The mother gives lack of insurance as an excuse but doesn't mention the heroine's apparent lack of good sense, driving skill or, most obviously, her failure to learn why the car won't start.",1503705600,4,469,4.650602409638554

4338613,4,B004EPYZCQ,At first I found this hard to watch because the main character is oblivious to her behavior and is in need of a serious attitude adjustment. I don't know if I would have kept watching but when Luke Wilson's character came into play it definitely drew me in! Viewers are accustomed to watching protagonists we respect so this was a bit weird. It does get better as the season progresses and Season 2 is much better than the first. There are moments where you come to root for everyone regardless of their flaws. Overall I ended up enjoying the story and would've kept watching had there been another season.,1502064000,,606,4.568807339449541
4338614,4,B004EPYZCQ,"I loved the first season and cried during each but the first episode (and I m not a crier for shows). I related to the character's sense of self worth being tied to her job. Feeling important then changing workgroups and having ""that boss"".Her struggles with personal relationships with her parent, lover, best friend, and co-workers are all too familiar. Struggling to hold onto hope. Life isn't always what you planned it to be- i needed something to show me I wasn't alone. The second season wasn't as relatible for me but I still found it entertaining.",1501891200,,556,4.742268041237113

In fact, I love the casting; whoever chose the actors for these roles did a superb job and nailed it.  Writing is excellent and acting is solid.  Scenery and sets are realistic.  What better place for this than the Riverside setting?  If you're familiar with that area, you know what I mean.

4338660,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Great performance, compelling and entertaining story. Laura Dern plays a unique character who is deeply flawed , sometimes she is wise, sometimes the fool. Mike White who plays her co worker in the story wrote this with Laura Dern. It is loosely based on an experience he had working for a tv network, he had a nervous breakdown. I found the characters relatable. It was great to see her acting again with her real mother Diane Ladd.",1493596800,3,433,4.636363636363637
4338661,3,B004EPYZCQ,"This show felt like Groundhog's Day...it was the same thing over and over again. There were moments where it felt like something could be taking off, and then it just wound back around to the same issue again and again. When the show shifts a bit to focus on her ex husband's addiction story, it's actually very real, t I touching, emotional, and interesting. It was unexpectedly raw in those moments of Season Two, and it made the entire thing worth watching at that point.

So, while this likely won't knock your socks off, it's a realistic look at addiction and relationships.",1492905600,2,579,4.676470588235294

I feel  at times I would like to say ""Don't say that, don't do that, don't go there, quit drawing attention to yourself"".  I get nervous on her behalf since she hasn't got a clue!

4339243,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Laura Dern and Mike White obviously went to tremendous effort writing ""Enlightened"" and producing it.  And HBO swooped down and cut it off as soon as they understood the concept of the series: blowing the whistle on corruption any at all times one sees it; that is, answering to your own conscience as Dern's character makes the decision to do at the end of the show.

Amy is a quirky and complex character.  So is Dougie, her alcoholic boyfriend.  While Amy finds hope in social rebellion, Dougie drowns in alcoholism and it is showed honestly  The sterility of the office place is shown with perfection.  Amy's mom is terrifying.

I wonder if Diane Ladd's real-life mothering looked as serene as her semi-detached character portrayal in the series. Laura Dern was pretty convincing as the semi-detached daughter. Apparently the father's suicide when Amy was just a little girl, sent them both mother and daughter off-kilter.

The mother was a grown-up, so she's aware of consequences. Amy is still a little kid, full of exuberance,oblivious to other people's sensibilities and short on impulse control, trying to function in the real world of big people.

Her mother is played by her real mother, Diane Ladd, who does a very good job as her perplexed mother, a mother who can't understand her daughter's new kinda kooky attitude.  And Luke Wilson as her ex-husband - great as well.  Every character is very believable.  The plot is getting a little bit strange at the point where I'm watching now, maybe a little bit unrealistic but, again, there are things happening in this world about which I know nothing, so maybe it's more realistic than I think.

4339848,3,B004EPYZCQ,"I found this show while looking for something to watch on Amazon Prime.  Acting is good, scripted not overly predictable. Strong performance by Laura Dern, although I've seen her in very little. I probably would have rated the show a bit higher, but the character Amy is so annoying! Self absorbed, irritating, do-gooder, who has a hugely inflated sense of herself. She leaches on to every cause out there in an effort to find someway to be recognized. I went into this knowing there was only 2 seasons, I don't think I could hang in there for anymore.

I love how they took this protagonist who most stories would write off as an annoying side character, and made her sympathetic. In a world full of male anti-heroes who are smarter and more competent than everyone around them, it was refreshing to see a protagonist that is kind of the opposite, an idealist who is struggling with her life, and often misses the mark. Easily one of my all time favorite shows.",1462320000,,571,4.5

I just binge watched the 2 seasons in 2 days.  Yes, she is frustrating.  That is the point.  Yes, she is a wreck.  Yes she is dangerous.  Yes, it can feel ""over the top"", if you have never seen, been, or experienced someone with: anxiety/mania/addiction/depression/ or a born again ""anything"".  The focus is not just on her, but the entire world around her and how they have to ""deal"" with the whirlwind.  How would you deal with it? As an observer, to look inside yourself as you watch this show and cringe at choices she makes.  Maybe realize, at some points, you have done something similar (like jumping to conclusions or engaging mouth before brain). Or in real life, looking down your nose at that person who just said the word ""therapy"" and slowly stepping backward from them.  What have they really gone through?  Do you want to engage in that?  Usually, like most of the characters here, the answer is no. Then there are those who do. This shows both sides.
What awesome writing this show delivers.  To flesh out entire episodes about the ""other"" characters that are the reasons for her actions, associated by her actions, and affected by the situations .  What wonderful acting as well.  Mike White and Laura Dern ran the whole show and seeing the end credits after each episode (and behind the scenes recaps) with all they accomplished is akin to the struggle of the main character.  To make a difference and bring problems to light.
To those who ""get it"", they did an awesome job.  Having missed an opportunity to make a third season is a shame, but it's packaged nicely in two.  I can only assume the haters only saw the first few episodes and wrote it off.  A shame, but maybe one day, when times are hard, it will find its way back and make sense to them!

4341222,5,B004EPYZCQ,"absolutely so relatable.  Every character is more than plausible, to the point that the audience can feel that them met them in the course of their lives.  This show illustrates that sometimes the most subtle nuances can have the most dramatic influence.  For example; her ex is in rehab but not quite on board with getting himself clean.  One night he skips out with 2 other rehab members.  The 3 of them have a night that they've probably had many times before but this time the ex sees it in a different light and without the show doing a lot of explaining, it's understood that this is his pivotal moment.

As Amy works to find herself by ""saving the world"", we come along with her through all her frustrations and bumbling mistakes.

4341832,3,B004EPYZCQ,"The theme that a spiritually eye-opened lady contributes to the world change is fine. However, main character(A)'s strong confidence on her behavior was very annoying to me. Amy forced her right way to her mother and other people. In the whole series, she believes that she does right thing but I feel her underlying intention is revenge or gaining a power again. She is very demanding, self-centered, nagging, and inconsiderate. Regardless of annoying character's reckless behavior, the last episode wrap up the story well.",1451088000,,524,5.25

4341834,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Not everyone will have the developed capacity to fully appreciate what is being shared in this series. It can be too powerful for those not ready for it. Season one displays the awkwardness of Amy's attempts to integrate and express her newly discovered insights about life, it's deeper
meanings/ it's higher operating principals of honesty and integrity and an individuals responsibility to apply these qualities in a world that often scoffs and  laughs at them because they have fallen so far that they have unwittingly become ''the walking dead'', so much so, that they are unable to admit it to themselves and others because the truth often hurts before it heals and liberates. This production is an excellent mirror of the old world paradigm colliding with the new one and the difficulties involved when the two meet head on.

Thanks to Mr. White and Ms. Dern in particular for having the courage to put this series and the message it contains forward for all to view and perhaps themselves become 'enlightened' as a result. Thanks to all others responsible for assisting in it's production and getting it onto the screen. Excellent job on an excellent show!!!

She's a character. The writers and the producers do a fine job of giving the lead character the space and grace the world can't really/won't really give to such a person--a platform, an audience. And it pays off. If this show continued so would, I think, the character's development.

I can see why she's a producer she believes in what she is doing and she's putting her money behind it. The tension between her and her former trainee -that took her job- is palpable, you can cut it with a knife, sometimes I find myself looking away from the screen ....I just can't stand the awkwardness and tension between the two of them. Very delightful series. Very original concept, I have a nice that's a hippie and thinks that she can change the world also. More power to her!",1444176000,,647,4.6347826086956525

I started the show and didn't put it down until I reached the end of the second season (or the finale).

This is one of the most captivating shows I've seen in a TV series (and there have been a lot of super good ones). Laura Dern  IS the whole show. She plays a gal who had what seemed to be a nervous breakdown; goes to a retreat in Hawaii and is 'enlightened to a whole new prospective.' Just listening to her is exhausting; she drives everyone around her crazy but she isn't mean, nasty or vindictive; she just wants to do good....so good that she makes everyone hate her even more!

Through various means she gets a job back at her old workplace and they are really not happy to see her. She is divorced and lives with her mother - who happens to be her mother in real life.

Telling you no more I just have to say that you just can't miss this gem and it is a gem. The show is so spectacular AND exhausting and funny and sad and a few sort of sort of 'uh oh' moments....all in all .just one hell of a good series!",1443571200,2,1207,4.03765690376569

4343759,5,B004EPYZCQ,"I HATE this series. It's a 5-star for me because it is so good at portraying how a woman should do her worst at work. The tragedy is that this is not comedy, but dramedy. It is so skillfully produced and written that you would hate the show because ... I have no words sufficient to describe the feeling.

I like all her self-righteous attitude and all. I wish I had her guts to project her self-righteousness, but when will the woman shut up, and do her job? I am Aspergeric but even then, there are pattern of things she does that even I would cringe as being not helpful.

But then without such a compulsive character, there would not be such a horridly good show that could make you fear that you might be her. With a mom who tries so realistically hard at not expressing her love if any for her daughter. Plus her corporate fantasies at success.

This show is so good at enlightenment in how potentially horrid but thoughtful a person you could be at work. It keeps putting me on the edge, praying for her for the whatever she would unexpectedly do the next minute. And the stuffs people say trying cover up for her or for themselves. And praying for her, that those same people would give her a chance in being sincere. Maybe I'm actually praying for myself for the guilt that I might be her.",1442102400,5,1298,4.333333333333333

It brought to mind the Nick Hornby book ""How to be good.""  The road to hell being paved w/good intentions! Got hooked after episode 1 & stayed up til 3 am that nite. Nxt nite, finished season 2 @ approx same time & went to bed looking forward to another binge night (& yet another groggy, sleep deprived day!) w/season 3. What a total freakin disappointment that HBO cancelled. It's never even occurred to me to petition to bring a show back to the tube but I would do so pronto.

Now, because of the low viewership when it was on air, it won't get it's final season. Long sigh. At least there is Season 2, which is equally as amazing, if not better.

4344710,4,B004EPYZCQ,"Not a show for everyone and it took me about three episodes to get hooked. But as the character building evolved I found it to be heartwarming and a semi-truthful snapshot of the people in corporate America; good, bad and clueless. Laura Dern is a great actor. Bottomline, enjoyable but you have to be a little patient for the plot and characters to kick in.",1440720000,,358,4.523076923076923

4344872,4,B004EPYZCQ,"Somewhat over the top, but timely comedy about stress and politics at work, and the struggle to realign work/life balance.

Laura Dern brings empathy to a character that might otherwise be easily dismissed.",1440633600,,303,5.608695652173913

We all want meaning in our lives.....or (as she found out) we don't.  Laura Dern is perfection in this role.  The casting for the whole show is spot-on.  I watched the entire first season in a very, very short amount of time.  I am pacing myself on Season 2 since there are no more.",1440374400,,435,4.2317073170731705

4344995,3,B004EPYZCQ,"Well, it is written, produced and performed by Laura Dern. Taa-daa! She plays an old hippie, ""enlightened"" divorcee who spent a small fortune on a Hawaiian healing retreat after she had a nervous breakdown at work because her married lover/boss dumped her. And that's just the first episode, or two. Oh, BTW! Her real mother, Dianne Ladd, plays her unsympathetic mother on the show. Fun, fun, fun!

4345393,2,B004EPYZCQ,"I'm at a very weird place with this show. I tend  to really enjoy most of the shows HBO puts out, so I decided to give this one a go. It's entertaining enough, but I really do not like the main character. She's ditzy, self-absorbed, annoying, and just too intense. In the episode where Sandy came to visit, she was completely over the top, blowing up her ex-husband's and Sandy's phones, calling them. COMING TO HIS HOUSE, and then trying to snoop in her journal, not once, but twice. She's so paranoid and neurotic that I find her absolutely irritating. The strange thing, though, is that I continue to watch. I like the show, but I can't stand her character.",1439683200,,660,4.5

4345395,5,B004EPYZCQ,"This is difficult to watch, but every minute is a must.  So well done - Laura Dern is brilliant in her portrayal of a young woman who is trying to re-establish herself into the corporate world she has known until she needed to leave for a time in a rehabilitation facility for drug and mental health issues.  She could be our daughter, our friend, and her struggle and need for acceptance are like any one of ours.  Parent/adult child relationships , dealing with an ex-husband and judgemental friends, it is all there.  This is a series full of hope and a positive future, fascinating and so true.  Highly recommended.",1439683200,,619,4.6422018348623855
4345466,5,B004EPYZCQ,"One of the craziest FRACKING Shows I have ever seen. I wanted to pull my hair out at times with her crazy bipolar characteristic, but she did it...she did it perfect and I think that's what made me so crazy....I have known people just like this, you just want to throw them off a roof because they are persistent and selfish in getting their ways. lol.

4345471,3,B004EPYZCQ,"It is not clear that she is at all enlightened. I quit watching after about 7 episodes, as she so lacked social intelligence, that she almost purposefully seemed to offend all the people around her. My only hope was that maybe the co-worder who rescued one of her books on enlightenment from the trash, might become enlightened---and thus the real star of the show. Or----maybe she really does step out of her own head to take a look at herself, and become more enlightened over time. I did love all the people who were cast around her.",1439596800,,536,4.536082474226804

4345566,4,B004EPYZCQ,"The main character is a 40 year old woman who recently returned from rehab where she tried to regain balance in her life.  She represents the surpressed person in most of us who wants to flip out when work becomes monotonous and unreasonable.  We hold our impulses back but she strives to enlighten those around her.  There is a good balance between the intellectual struggle and the crazy reality.  I would not classify her as smart so you the viewer will be entertainmed by her missteps along the way.  I find that the show does help me reflect on my own emotional struggles but in a much healthier way than offered on the show.  Sometimes the show is a little predictable or cliche, but overall, entertaining.",1439424000,,712,4.611111111111111

4345569,5,B004EPYZCQ,It is everything that I read it is.  Laura Dern's character can be annoying and reminded me of someone who is a borderline personality.  People with this disorder can be draining to those around them.  But she is also idealistic and cares about people and ready to take up a cause and fight for what she believes in.  A complex character with a complex life.  A giving person but one you could want to run from.  But one that you want to see get what she wants.,1439337600,,461,4.241379310344827
4345570,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Loved this show!  So sad it wasn't continued.  Love Laura Dern's charater's determination to change! And not buy into the fear based reality.

4346506,2,B004EPYZCQ,"I don't blame the actors - or even the writers, after a fashion - but rather the editors. This show is begging for editing from the word go. It tries for humor, but isn't amusing. It tries for In Your Face Reality, but is clunky and over the top. It tries to be entertaining, but is just bland. I can't, in good faith, recommend this show for anyone.

Main character Amy is billed as a neurotic ""career woman"" (you just know that that phrase appeared somewhere on the screenplay notes) who starts the series with a breakdown. The premise of the show is her trying to live a better, more enlightened life using tips she's learned while at a tropical anger-management retreat. A retreat she spent one month at. We're supposed to laugh along with her as she fails to remain calm, flipping her lid at least once per episode. Her bumbling but goodhearted attempts to fix herself are supposed to endear her to us; isn't she just like us? Trying to be the better person, but sometimes failing in humorous ways?

Except that Amy is about as likable as bloody snot. This tone-deaf show from _two-thousand-eleven_ has Amy engaging in such whimsy as sneering at overweight people in her workplace, mocking the technical staff, and demanding that she be placed in a role more appropriate for a tall blonde with no skills (""I was a BUYER!"" she sneers to a software engineer). At one point, the show even uses the dried-out joke of showing the unfortunate other women who have been relegated to this hellhole that is An Actual Job - fat, dumpy misfits with pockmarked faces, ill-fitting _non-designer!!!_ clothes, and - horrorshow! - GLASSES. Like, uck-a-doo, am I rite gals?

Being a woman in an office setting, Amy has of course slept with her married boss - lazy Hollywood shorthand for capital-C Crazy Woman. Her breakdown in the first episode, as we slowly discover, may not have been entirely due to her being Crazy. The boss starts retaliating against Amy as she won't sleep with him. Yet, in 2015, the married male boss taking sexual advantage of his employees is, well, sometimes considered bad. In other words, we knew she wasn't Crazy from the first episode, so we had - and have - pity for her. She should have gone to a lawyer, not a retreat. That pity ends up misplaced and awkward as the show goes on longer and longer without acknowledging that the entire situation was really creepy. You start to dislike the show itself for the slow, self-congratulatory moralization it forces on you: We shouldn't be so quick to judge Amy as Crazy! ...but we never did. We never did.

For a show about a woman with a job, it relentlessly mocks women with jobs.

Amy is alternately dismissive and ingratiating, depending on who she is talking with (the IT staff is beneath her because she is pretty; the HR staff is above her because they control her placement). Yes, these things get better as the season goes on. But getting there is slow, torturous, and - worst of all - boring. The show is smarmy and awkward, missing humor on any level as it tries to moralize at you that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover (HR can be nice! IT can be cool! A Crazy Woman can be a good person!).

But let's face it; if, in 2015, you needed Hollywood to teach you those things one episode at a time, you're already a lost cause.

4346508,4,B004EPYZCQ,"I am very disturbed that this show is listed as a comedy because it is actually a tragedy with comic moments. Laura Dern found her niche on this one, and plays the role brilliantly. The show is about the struggle of a neurotic 40 something year old, divorced, woman who suffered a breakdown after emotional abuse by a workplace affair, and who tries to find the good and spiritual in everyone and everything.

4346614,2,B004EPYZCQ,"The programme synopsis sounded interesting. So I decided to give this show a chance having never heard of it before. The first few episodes were okay, enough to warrant further viewing. Or maybe I genuinely had nothing else better to do. But as much as I wanted it to, it never picks up from there. In fact, as you progress through the season, the more unlikeable Laura Dern's character becomes. Having watch season 2 as well. I can genuinely say, if you don't love it from the beginning you never will. I can definitely see why this show was cancelled. There is very little to love about it.",1436745600,2,592,4.4907407407407405

4346616,4,B004EPYZCQ,"Enlightened?! Hmmmmm? I'm not sure anyone would say anyone in this showed is ""enlightened"" even though the main character, Amy, played by Laura Dern, keeps wondering if she is, in fact, ""enlightened"". Amy has somewhat of a breakdown at work after finding out ... No spoilers here - suffice it to say, things aren't going her way, and she does NOT like it, and everyone hears how much she doesn't like it and why! LOL

So... Amy heads for therapy in Hawaii! Which is where she thinks she's reached some state of enlightenment. (HA!)  Afterwhich she heads back to her old place of employment expecting to be welcomed back with open arms, which isn't exactly what she finds! Imagine that! That's more of a spoiler than I like to give, but it gives an idea of this person's mindset. (Uh Borderline Personality perhaps?!)

For anyone who hasn't yet seen the show the answer is .... Well sorry, I try not to do spoilers too much, but you know what they say about people who keep doing the same thing over and over, even though it's not working for them? This is Amy ... Plus the fact that she just doesn't seem to have the ability to ever see anything she does from anyone else's POV, or how it might adversely affect them.  I've never known anyone quite like this, but if I did I'd head for the hills!

Amy's mother, Helen, is played by Diane Ladd. Not exactly the warm, fuzzy type -- kind of like a Brillo pad.  Although that doesn't stop Amy from trying to extort whatever she can from her, and not feel the least bit guilty for it, or responsible for her situation.

Helen at least has the brains to see that Amy's last little feat, before the end of the 2nd season isn't something she should have done, even if Helen thinks Amy shouldn't have done it because she should be grateful! And not because .... Well you'll just have to watch and see!

4347502,2,B004EPYZCQ,"Luke Wilson and Laura Dern are two of my favorite actors, and I'm used to seeing both in far more realistic and engaging vehicles of production. In this brief series, the protagonist Amy, (Dern) is a newly enlightened survivor of the typical corporate structure, having had the sheer stupidity to develop an office affair with her boss.  Dumped and furious, she commits the ultimate error, by acting out the enraged lover blues in front of her entire department. The classic ""nervous breakdown"", in front of god and company.  In the followup developments, Amy agrees to enter a new age enlightenment program, which leans heavily upon the heal everyone from within strategy. Unfortunately for Amy, her brand of reawakening goes against the tide of majority approval and corporate change stall. No one is more dense in terms of bringing about sustainable change than Amy. Every cause becomes her personal mission to open the eyes of fellow employees to the destructive dealings of Big Brother, in this case-just about everyone BUT herself.
I am not particularly certain this series has any redemptive values, since in every scenario, the viewer is compelled to follow her every move with a great deal of skepticism.  Essentially, some of her peers may actually understand and possibly value her attempts to bring about change from within, however after 5 or 6 separate situations, Amy drives all or most folks off, with her incessant rants and raves about ""making major change and bringing this evil corporation to its knees.  Should have known this set up is nothing more than a vehicle for her to make everything about herself and no one else.  After a few episodes, I wanted to open up a large vein, and call it quits.  Amy's behavior is intended for good, however she just cannot accept her powerlessness and numbing self absorption.  In short, she is her own worst enemy.
Wilson's character is that of Amy's divorced husband, himself of victim of self indulgent use of a vast array of substances just made to be abused by a willing soul hell bent on self destruction.  Usually, Wilson brings an air of quirky, off base humor and willing self deprecating all around good guy who refuses to confront his problems head on.  Instead, he chooses alcohol, pills, coke and other substances as his vehicles for imbalance. He's a wreck, but it's all Amy's fault, because he can't admit his failings and replace addictive behavior with healthy emotional and physical balance.
Dump all this angst and internal/external stress into the corporate structure, and what emerges is sludge and grunge mismatched thoughts of how to keep it real in this dog-eat-dog world.
I think this could have become a quirky female character-driven sniff-com, but the problem is that Dern's overplaying her issues and psycho-babble self-worth schemes, to the point of sheer annoyance and sniveling self importance. Amy wants to save the world, one step at a time, but Dern's performance just makes this impossible to appreciate.  Whiny and self absorbed, nagging and niggling to the extreme, it didn't take long for me to have my teeth on edge from listening to the unending streams of wimpy, prissy and utterly nauseously presented viewpoints.  You don't feel much for Amy, due to Dern's overwheming spoof of new age trancendentalism.  She is not a sympathetic cause. WAY too much in the extremes, Dern has cut off her characters more likeable traits, in support of her self involved ""healing"".  Junk.
I may have liked to see at least 1 or 2 episodes of this series, but I don't feel like buying the DVD, only to probably waste my money and toss it into the donations bag in a few months. No, I gave this show up after the series finale, which felt anything but healthy.
Surprised that these two fine actors have bludgeoned this presentation into the weeds with trite scripted dialogue and the penchant to preach to those no longer interested in hearing or seeing.
I can't recommend this DVD or series presentation, because it's all just so unlikeable.  It may have a valid point regarding world pollution and catastrophe looming just over the far ridgeline, but no one cares about any of it, except perhaps Amy.  And she's out to convince everyone that her view is the only acceptable one, no matter the cost.  It's a ""no-go"" series, in need of some serious reworking and restructuring; don't fall for the cutesy voice (whiny) and the empathetic expression, ( squinty-eyed) which Dern somehow manages to turn into a sneer of self and other loathing disdain. Pass. Read a good book instead.",1434758400,2,4562,4.905194805194805

4348666,3,B004EPYZCQ,"If you can get around the main character it's a pretty interesting story. Second season was MUCH better in my opinion (possibly because all the episodes did not center around Amy).
I guess Amy is like some people I've known in real life. They have issues, they fix their issues, and suddenly they're going to fix the world (while somehow still remaining the most self-absorbed people on the planet). She has absolutely no boundaries whatsoever. Really wants to make the world a better place but can't possibly live on 26K a year working at a homeless shelter. I'm left wondering why she can't volunteer like everyone else (as her mother suggests, who seems to have a pretty good head on her shoulders, having seemingly held it together through a pretty tragic family situation). Every interaction with her poor ""friend"" is just painful (you have to wonder how much of a ""friend"" she was before the breakdown because afterwards she makes EVERY situation somehow revolve around her).
I kind of wonder where the creators of the show were going...whether they were intentionally trying to make the main character so unsympathetic. I had very few moments where I felt for the main character...mostly I felt bad for the people around her.

During the second season the plot develops much farther and the story is MUCH more interesting, if you can get there (or frankly maybe you can bypass the first season lol).",1432339200,3,1406,4.858333333333333

Loved the series and wish it went on to a season three. Be prepared though, I found myself struggling with/for the main character and some of her awkward, icky, and just plain miscalculated interactions with friends and co-workers. Its all part of the character's growth, but that didn't make it any easier to watch as she overstepped boundaries, assumed and acted on the worse case scenario only to find out she had misjudged, and learned the hard way throughout the progression of both seasons. The viewer really cares for this character and her success.",1429747200,,712,4.844262295081967

Just too much whackadoo behavior (accompanied with high-pitch whining) to make the final comments of each episode believable or meaningful. All the characters (with the exception of her shy nerdy coworker) were obnoxious and unlikable. Even Luke Wilson (whom I really really like) did not play a sympathetic character as far as I am concerned.

Just wanted to slap her for stupidity. Her decisions at work about how to approach people and situations are not at all believable for someone who supposedly spent 15 years at an important position in a major corporation. Did she learn nothing about corporate culture? About what is, and is not OK to do and say in front of peers? Sniveling, leftist, hippy, flower-child crap from someone old enough to know better.

4350588,4,B004EPYZCQ,"Great performances from Laura Dern, Diane Ladd, and Luke Wilson highlight this touching, funny, quirky, and slightly offbeat drama about a rehabbed & emotionally and mentally reborn woman with a trunk-load of personal issues.  It is a bit predictable and does get a little preachy in its idealistic messages sometimes, but the beauty is is that it then goes on to often shatter those very messages and show how flawed life and the characters truly are.  It is definitely easy to watch at 30 minutes per episode.  Had the creators tried to make it an hour long show, I don't think it would have worked.  As it is, the pacing stays fluid and engaging.  In my opinion, the best parts are the little monologues narrated by the main character, that often will strike a chord with the viewer, as well as the well acted interactions and conflicts between Amy (Laura Dern) and those from her past.
It's definitely worth a watch if you have 30 or 60 minutes.",1427846400,,949,4.625

New-age comedy Enlightened: 'funny, excruciating, near-perfect TV'

Says everything better than I could say it but I'll repeat the summary: It's funny.  It's excruciating.  And it IS near-perfect TV.  The only think ""not - perfect"" about it is its cancellation.  What's up with that??",1427673600,,551,6.351351351351352

4350595,4,B004EPYZCQ,"This series follows a likeable, frustrating, annoying, idealist woman who is trying to build a life after Life has kicked her in the teeth. To be truthful, she creates a lot of her own drama and yet she is still a sympathetic character. Watching the work of many fine actors- including Ms. Dern's real-life mother, is fascinating. Although there are many cringeworthy moments, I found the people in ""Amy Jellico's"" life to be interesting, funny, damaged people and I was drawn into these relationships. The second season shares with the audience how much they have struggled and I am very disappointed that we won't be able to see another season to see the complete arc of these characters.

Amy, the central figure, is idealistically flawed, impulsive, but likeable. I thought the second season was awesome, and even though HBO cancelled the 3rd season, they provided a very satisfying ending.  There was no cliff hanger.  If you are in support of honesty, transparency viewing whistle blowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange (Wiki Leaks) as heroes, you will probably enjoy this series.

Anyway, Amy Jellico is a woman who has had one breakdown, been enlightended for 48,000 dollars at some sort of mental health facility in Hawaii and is back at her old company, but with a lower valued job - one in the basement.  Which is pretty nice of them since she went bat crazy with a married man she was having an affair with - and who was at her company at work when she had her attack against him with yelling and screaming.
The rest of the season shows her ex husband and his problems, their continuing relationship, her living with her mother, who has not exactly made Amy feel too special all her life, and how Amy tries to use what she learned in therapy to rise above her herself and make a difference.  Along the way, there are some really good moments, and also some dragging dead space time.(in my opinion.)  However, I liked it enough to watch Season 2.",1425945600,,937,4.217877094972067

We laughed our heads off because of the situation of a person trying to share New Age values in a corporate culture when she is already discredited so badly. The second viewing of season one for review made me a lot more uncomfortable for some reason. Perhaps I see some of myself and people I have known in her character and I have become close with a head of a company and seen the internal struggles of leading a large corporation intimately. Talk about conflicted!

4353317,4,B004EPYZCQ,"The bad news is, I feel like there's something missing. There's plenty of heart & soul in between the lines, but something about Dern's performance rubs me the wrong way. Are we supposed to know she's not really genuine about her philosophies & new found views? Or does she even know herself? And maybe that's the appeal of the show, but I'm not much of a post-modernist, so that's probably why I couldn't fully grasp what it was Mike White was trying to convey. Nonetheless, it really is an eerily accurate portrayal of toxic corporate culture, and although Dern's character comes across as the ""crazy"" one, in the end, she prevails, and I like routing for her. Because whether or not I know what she really believes, I like her. And I think regardless of your own philosophies about life, you should be able to empathize with a character struggling to start fresh, and desperate to change themselves.",1424476800,,902,4.715189873417722

4353320,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Amy is the extreme version of cray cray we have all, more or less, watched someone slowly become or personally morphed into and out of over the course of a professional career. Her personal life and relationships mirror the sort disfunction that typically simmers just below the surface of every well meaning narcissist repeatedly excreted from the bowels of traditional corporate culture. This is a painful series to watch at times, if for no other reason than it sheds light on just how much we have in common with the very structures that seemingly, by design, shapes others to be what they feel they should be, while never coming to grips with the destructive forces they have ultimately become. Robin Wright's character Sandy visits the show in episode 6. I don't feel I'm exagerating when I say the show is worth watching from the beginning just to get to this one. When an actor can come on screen for a total of possibly 12 min and make you glad you took the time to get there. I can only describe her performance as perfect magic.

After seeing just four episodes, I'd describe this as an immensely poignant show.  Some of the writing and scenes perfectly showcase all the little things that can make life beautiful, even if on the surface things can appear difficult or not very beautiful indeed.  This show peels back the layers to show the subtleties of everyday life and human interactions.

4354556,5,B004EPYZCQ,"This show kind of made me fall in love with Luke Wilson but it's Laura Dern's performance that makes it worth watching. Her character is unbalanced, prone to bursts of rage, and for this reason hangs on for dear life to the messages of peace and self acceptance contained in her self help books. As a narrator she seems crazy, but then she'll give voice to words of true wisdom, and you're like, who is this lady? She's capable of being resourceful and strategic and completely self interested. At the same time she's also nave and trusting in people and keeps trying and trying no matter how many times she's disappointed or betrayed. It's a broad comedy with moments of real pathos and wisdom. My favorite story line was the relationship between her and her ex-husband Levi (Luke Wilson), the office plots got a little silly and farfetched, but overall I think it's an outstanding series with brilliant acting by Laura Dern.",1421625600,,926,4.722222222222222

Those soliloquies in every episode were annoyingly vague and reminiscent of high school poetry. Amy is probably the most annoying lead role ever.  She's self-absorbed, clueless, and lazy.

She. Just. Cannot. Take. The. BS. Any. More.

And it is beautiful, and also so, so, so, awkward to watch. And that's really the point.

Laura Dern, a wonderful actress, plays here a typically Los Angeles woman: not very bright, slept through school, totally superficial, a mess. All that's missing is the mandatory surf board and wet suit in her car trunk and primary conversation being ""Surf after work?"" Luke Wilson is also terrific as a kind-of dopey booze-and-drugs but sincere jerk. Mike West, the creator and co-star, who looks like a simpleton and plays one, is more LA - stupid and easily manipulated. Now I love LA and have lived there, and there are plenty of brilliant people there (lots or most from the Northeast), but these are the natives whose families came West from the Dust Bowl or the Midwest. This series is totally overrated. It's another example of a mediocre HBO series reviewers treat as sent direct from Heaven. Overall, the series on Showtime are far better. I do want to single out one episode in season one in which Robin Wright guest stars. She's not to be missed. She's another empty vessel filled with idiotic life advice she actually doesn't understand and she just floats along screwed up completely, a total mess, but the most staggeringly beautiful mess you've ever seen.",1420329600,,1344,4.797413793103448

4355360,4,B004EPYZCQ,"Although I liked this show very much, it touched on some issues that I can personally relate to in regards to the character Amy. Amy reminds me of someone I know who is very near and dear to me. Laura Dern is an awesome actress and she played this part to perfection. I feel sorry for her character but at the same time she's a very complex individual who can quickly get on your nerves if you're not careful around her and aware of her antics. People with a personality such as Amy's (boderline personality disorder I think), tend to draw the rest of us into their drama, whether we want to be there or not. Amy forces her co-workers into positions that they wouldn't otherwise be in. Although she's kind by nature, she's highly manipulative and can be overbearing when she doesn't get her way about things she feels passionate about. She throws adult temper tantrums, which translates into insecurity, narccisium, and inmaturity, traits that many people with BPD have. But when Amy is not acting out, she a very kind and pleasant person. All in all I enjoyed ""Enlightened"" very much. One of the best shows ever to hit the airways.",1419897600,,1132,4.58128078817734

4355367,3,B004EPYZCQ,"Not bad if you can stomach the Amy character.  In two whole seasons there's only one episode - late in the second season- in which the main character Amy has an authentic emotion - when her ex-husband returns from rehab. And then it only lasts for a minute. The rest of the time this character is the epitome of every phony, self-absorbed, obnoxious, manipulative, narcissistic, vapid, new age airhead OC drama queen of your worst imaginings...and that's being overly generous.  Thank goodness for the very real and grounded performances of her mother, her ex, and her office mate Tyler.  In the end, she gets hers, though, when she's used in the same way she uses everybody else.  The plot was okay, but mostly predictable.  This series wasn't awful; just ok. I struggled to give this 3 stars, but the performances by Luke Wilson, Diane Ladd and Mike White are quite good.",1419724800,,873,4.754966887417218
4355523,3,B004EPYZCQ,Interesting dialogue XO script and why I gave it three stars is that a downer watching somebody make all these mistakes over and over wanting to change everyone else or I guess I guess I wouldn't want to become a bit more enlighten quicker,1419724800,,239,4.454545454545454

4355525,3,B004EPYZCQ,"The show is highly uneven. It seems that Mike White just isn't sure if he wants to make fun of the protagonist (played very well by Laura Bern) for being highly naive or praise her as a martyr. It has some interesting ideas about investigative journalism and life motivation, and makes southern California look beautiful, but since I never know what to make of Dern's character I'm left not caring.",1419638400,,398,4.7

I wasn't sure if I was going to purchase a prime account, but as the show began to show its true intentions, now I am glad I waited. I don't appreciate watching another mastication/vomit of the left wing agenda. And with all the sickness we're witnessing in this once great nation, it's OK to throw up.

The lead character is annoying at best from mannerisms, to the language, to the looks. Pretty much every aspect of her character is unlikeable. That is probably the point but it's too successful. 2 stars because I really like Luke Wilson.",1419552000,,368,4.426470588235294

Though its protagonist had a lot of relateable flaws, there was nothing intrinsic in her or her plight to admire or like enough to make you root for her. No interesting conflict, just another self-absorbed SoCal gal flapping around in a mess she made all by herself",1419552000,2,401,4.4324324324324325

4355606,5,B004EPYZCQ,Starts kind of slow but then builds up and puts all the angles into perspective. The series hits a mind explosion with what I remember to be the 9th episode when the camera stays at home and shows mother's life during the day -- rendering an unlike able character suddenly all too human and fragile to bear...

The gist: Woman just out of rehab gets a job back with her old employer, just not the same job. She's clearly not wanted, as she is part of a group of employees relegated to the basement of the building in a do-nothing dead end job. She tries to keep a good face on the situation and tries to get involved with different ""causes"" that are out there.

There was also some content that I found to be offensive. It wasn't worth continuing. I know now for future reference, that HBO shows may have some pretty rough stuff that I'm not used to seeing/hearing on broadcast TV.

4356988,3,B004EPYZCQ,"I think. Everyone knows someone like Amy (Laura Dern).My opinion of this  show is that it wants to identify why some people are painful to be around.  Painful and awkward situations  that can happen to any of us with our own Amy.
If you work or have a neighborhood or even in  a church community, you know Amy. This Amy is a Californian adult and  a sizable amount of emotional baggage: too much to list here. Besides, that would spoil it wouldn't it?
She has learned some meditation stuff after having a mental breakdown. We get to see how she copes with life after breakdown: Elderly Mom(Diane Ladd), loving ex husband (Luke Wilson) and  his baggage and her past and present coworkers attitudes and reactions towards Amy.
 Amy constantly oversteps persons' boundaries and disregards social conventions.
By the way, if you ARE AMY, we need you.
Though you are irritating,wecan learn to listen, forebearance and humility and extend grace to you.

I think that it is obvious that Mike White and Laura Dern did not want to make Amy (or any of the characters) completely likable, but she does have a certain cringe inducing sincerity that is endearing.
The show's tone shifts between ""The Office"" style satire and well observed humanism that is difficult to describe and may be an acquired taste, but I thought it was really good.

She was so volatile and irrational, i didn't understand how she had managed to work at Abbadon 15 yrs without getting fired before now. Anyway, her observations (narrations) at the beginning and end of the show were the only things that made me see her as a normal, rational character.

It was great to see Ladd play Dern's mom onscreen.  This series is compelling enough to get me through the both seasons.  Dern is talented, but there's too much of her for it to be five star. The second season is more enjoyable because the main character's dismal life begins to change as she becomes a change agent for others.  Also, there are perspectives from more characters. I loved the irony of the main character getting the job she wanted after she blew the whistle. This show is every working person's fantasy.

4357588,5,B004EPYZCQ,"I just loved this show! The characters were so infectious. Sometimes in a bad way but I couldn't help but feel for there point of view.

Brilliantly written and the acting was flawless.

The story line is fairly simple but the depth of which it goes just gets deeper and more intense. The final few episodes had me on the edge of my seat as the build up was too much!

I highly rate this show and yes perhaps it was canned after 2 seasons but it ended perfectly fine for me.

If only Amy really existed... I'd go shake her hand!",1415664000,,528,4.147058823529412

She returns home determined to bring love and enlighten to the rest of the world. Instead she is the most self absorbed, selfish, arrogant person. She is so annoying and unlikeable, every time she was on screen I cringed. There is nothing ""enlightened"" about this woman.",1415577600,3,390,4.924242424242424

4357723,2,B004EPYZCQ,"I usually really like Laura Dern. But this show - it was kind of like watching a train wreck; Hard to stop, and hard not to gawk. I figured I would watch a few episodes, but I clicked 'Stop' during Ep. 6 (""Sandy"") when the main character (Amy) is about to snoop into her friend's personal journal/diary (just after she perpetrated her ex husband and the same friend by barging in on them in a bedroom). I simply couldn't watch it anymore. All this so-called ""treatment,"" ""healing,"" ""self-help,"" and ""growth"" from a person who tries to teach others how to ""be so great,"" but she (Amy) cannot mind her own business, respect her mother's wishes, do her job, be on time, be straightforward, or understand that her actions have consequences. She isn't walking her talk. She won't let other people be, and she cannot do her own work (and I don't mean just her computer entry ""job,"" but her own inner work). I will not watch the rest. Maybe just for fun I'll skip to the last available episode to see if she ever actually ""evolved"" out of her unconsciousness, endless ""making everyone wrong fiascoes,"" and her perpetual ""low grade upset."" Grow up, Amy. Your ""transformation"" is just a boring ego-trip. Keep it simple!",1415318400,,1210,4.658878504672897

The characters and situations are so well written and performed that I felt I was watching real-life situations and people from my own life experiences. Incredibly well written and performed!

The complex human interaction situations and the continued drive of Amy to alter the wrongs in life kept me guessing as to what is going to happen next. Bottom line, I highly recommend this series to everyone....",1415318400,,575,5.052631578947368

4357965,5,B004EPYZCQ,"This series ""Enlightened"" touches upon important issues, many of which are problematic in our society and in dire need of change, i.e., mental illness, its cause, its devastation, its discrimination, and its harmful effect on polarizing others.  Serious as these issues are they are portrayed in an absolutely hilarious and realistic manner.. Most impressive, the character's portrayal of emotional content provoked strong feelings of empathy, despite their significant degree of character flaws. This, in in my opinion, strengthened its portrayal of reality, therefore interesting and thought provoking.  Additionally, the acting was excellent. A very broad range of  emotions was portrayed by each character and done so quite masterfully. I hope the series continues.",1415059200,,769,5.787610619469026

Great characters and mother-daughter dynamic... And I love the fact that Dern is actually playing the role with her mother in real life!
Kind of a 'Bridget Jones' meets 'Postcards From The Edge'.
The ex husband, although a bit too close to home for me, round out this extremely well acted and written show.

This and Transparent keep my Kindle turned on all the time and these two series alone are worth the price of Amazon Prime.  Dern's character is so true to life (I know a person just like her...and yes...she's crazy) and thinks she is single handedly saving the world. It's hysterical to watch all the craziness unfold. I wish the series would go on forever.,1415059200,,475,4.654761904761905
4358049,1,B004EPYZCQ,"Watched four episodes just to be sure that it was really as bad as it started. Sometimes shows just have to find their feet, this one never found anything that was worth watching. The one constant of self centered whinning from the main character made it impossible to watch. Writers obviously went to the book store self help aisle and thought they could make a series about self realization. They thought wrong. It tries to be funny at times but fails completely.  Let this series fade into history. Decent premise but completely lacks anything that would warrant the use of the electricity required to watch it.",1414972800,,614,4.7924528301886795

Whether for revenge or out of a true sense that her company was caring about the bottom line more than the employees or customers, she found a way to accomplish her mission.  I found myself wanting to reach through the screen to shake her into reality when she was acting insane and totally self-centered, yet wondering why people did not understand or want to be near her.  In the finale, I did not have a sense that she was any better than the greedy people she brought down because she broke laws and relationships in judgmental and selfish ways without regard of how she used others to accomplish her goals.

I couldn't wait for each new episode in the life of this delightful (and also sad) woman.  This show depicts how we really are in this crazy (and crazy making) modern world.  Yet the heart break of realities (losing babies, mercurial friendships and divorce/death) are all there to let us know that our humanity and how we deal with it remains universal!

4358779,5,B004EPYZCQ,A  remarkable show. The writing is wonderful. It gives voice to so much that is left silent but felt. It is not to be missed. I am sad it did not have a third season.,1413331200,,166,3.742857142857143

4358841,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Laura Dern's character Amy is supremely disturbed.  I almost gave up on the journey because Amy's self-absorption was maddening.  But if you stick through it to Episode 8 about her mom... and in Season 2 the Episode about her ex-husband Levi.  I promise it's worth the irritation.  This is a clever comedy sure to stir up love/hate/emotions... which is the point, right?  P.S. Sarah Burns is BRILLIANT as Krista... OMG just watch her facial expressions.",1413331200,,453,4.986666666666666
4358842,3,B004EPYZCQ,Be prepared to squirm (and yes laugh) as you watch this pathetic girl rise and fall as she tries to navigate her life. She's oblivious to the consequences of her actions and continues to march in the wrong directions based on poor decision making skills and inability to make inferences. Yet there is something about her and the story line that is compelling. One roots for her success and yearns to see her throw off her failures and actually find her way. There are actual glimmers of self enlightenment that give you faith that she will find her way. Keep watching.,1413331200,,568,4.633663366336633

It is unfortunate that she has to be wrapped around ""yoga"", ""justice"", ""enlighten life""...etc. I guess that was the intention, bash the hippies. Also, what's with IT-nerd bashing?

4359127,2,B004EPYZCQ,It's an okay series... I watched the first 4 episodes and I just felt sorry for her (the main character) and after a while it became a repeat of her personal emotions... In a sense it became booking!!!,1412812800,,201,4.315789473684211
4359128,1,B004EPYZCQ,"I did not enjoy this show at all. Several times it attempts to be funny and is not. There was no pull for me to watch another show. No big "" I gotta see what happens"" feeling. I watched a second show just in case the pilot wasn't that good. I honestly don't understand what makes this show so good it got a second season. It's sad. ( which doesn't make it bad, just not interesting) the actors see like they are trying too hard and the lines are just flat. Laura dern's ditziness is irritating, it doesn't play well. The fiLming is awful, i don't know f it's the color they use but something is off. I wasn't interested in anything this show had to say bit perhaps you will be.

4359248,4,B004EPYZCQ,"The show is just another example of how a person can make excuses for his or her actions and how easy it is to convince oneself that sometimes a wrong can make a right (whether it does or not).  The show is clever, funny and sad all at once.  The main character, Amy, played by Laura Dern, does an exceptional job of playing a righteous person laced with psychotic behaviors. One moment you can't believe she is so completely self-absorbed and oblivious. Then you find yourself cheering her on while she is fighting to make a change and make some sense in this crazy messed up world.  The acting is believable for most of the characters. . The writing is good, but misses now and again; things are just incomplete (ex: Amy's mother's story, Amy's work environment and what she did before she left, Levi's and Amy's, etc..)

The acting and the chemistry and dynamics between the characters was believable and the directing of the show seemed to be pretty good.  perhaps the thing that was somewhat bothersome to me was the main characters voice.  At times it was somewhat grating to me and, considering that she not only has most of the dialog, but also narrates a good portion of each episode, that quality was relevant to me.  I imagine that her voice was part of the significance of her character, who could be somewhat grating on everyone with whom she interacts in the show.  Her character is both unrealistic and avoids taking responsibility for her actions in many ways and also, in some ways, is somewhat of an innocent who really does not get the truth of how people are responding to her.  Ultimately, she tries, though to see the good in life and to find the truth within herself.  It is this diligence that appeals to me.",1410652800,,1084,4.551546391752577

4360016,3,B004EPYZCQ,It is a hard series to watch bc the characters are all so flawed. It is more of 3.5 stars. It is just a long introduction but season 2 really hits the ground running. Watch Season One bc Season 2 is amazing bc of the set up here. But this one just shows all the ugly of the main character slowly. It will make you squirm and it is sad. But the writers are really doing something fresh which is rewarded so far in what I have seen in 4 episodes of season 2. The main character is a mess with no social grace and is 40 years old living with her mom. Complicated divorce and slowly revealed complicated/painful childhood. She was in a relationship with a coworker in a great job but flips out at work after she gets broken up with. After spending a fortune to get sober/therapy at a place in Hawaii she comes for her job back. She gets a job back with other trouble makers and socially ungrateful misfits down in the basement.

4360434,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Great writing, perfectly cast. The main characters are complex and believable, while the supporting characters add a little extra humor, especially Timm Sharp as darkly clueless Dougie, who nonetheless really does wear a great shirt. Yes, there is humor, but I would say more of a drama with humor than you might expect.

Laura Dern's, Amy, can be maddening at times until you realize that this is about someone who has made a big change in their life, but it has not been even close to be fully processed. The old Amy is still there in the shadows, and the old Amy is in many ways not so very different than the people the ""new"" Amy deems self-centered and calculating. Just when you wonder if she really is *only* the old Amy, she will realize something important about life and herself. Her heart, if not always in the right place, is heading there. This brings a believable sense of hope, and the show benefits from that.

Luke Wilson's character, unrepentant as he is, nevertheless brings some needed honesty to the scenes they share, and I always was happy to see him. Good chemistry between them, too, a believable pair. Dianne Ladd, who plays Amy's mother and is Laura Dern's mother is real life, is solid and convincing, a great foil to Amy's blue sky aspirations. One wonders what doing this together was like for them, and one hopes, only good. Mike White brings a touching poignancy to his character as he reveals the pain of his loneliness, but with just enough humor and never over milking it. That he also is the main writer, producer and even directed at least one episode is astonishing. Talented man to say the least.

It's a pity this was not let to run longer, but they were given the time to wrap up the story lines, so you are not left hanging on the major plot points. Not all wrapped up neatly in bow, yet it certainly seemed a realistic and satisfying conclusion to me.",1409011200,,1894,4.548387096774194

4360675,1,B004EPYZCQ,"After viewing the first seven episodes, I gave up on this series despite previous acting laurels earned by the mother/daughter team of Dern and Ladd. Why? Because the lead character Amy (Dern) is perhaps the most consistently annoying person EVER! All she does is make poor choices then uses everyone around her to get what she wants. When she is thwarted, which she often is, she gets this stupid quizzical grimace to indicate that she can't imagine how anyone could not see things her way. This ""look"" occurs many times each episode. It is not funny. It is not sad. It is lousy cinema.

Even as she is trying to better herself and the planet she is so oblivious to everyone close to and around her - and there are so many people in this world that resemble this character!

I watched the whole season in a couple of days - something about it kept me coming back.  Maybe to see if she would actually get it - show compassion to the people nearest to you as well as strangers.  It seemed like she did - in the end - and even then only a little bit.

But as I got into about the 6th episode or so, her (Laura Dern) character started to get really irritating and felt contrived.  Like others wrote, her character is very self absorbed (borderline narcissistic), selfish, and kind of clueless and having all the melodrama dumped on you in large doses at a time gets, well, sort of overwhelming.  I don't think I will continue to watch this series as her character has pushed too many of my buttons and left me frustrated and unhappy at the same time.",1407542400,,639,4.6371681415929205

4361009,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Since the episodes are 30 minutes I expected a typical TV comedy format but Enlightened will let scenes play out slowly for five minutes. Most TV shows find a narrow caricature for each of the characters to occupy and let the plot pivot around them in funny ways. I had a much harder time pigeonholing Enlightened's characters. For example Amy's initial voiceover and demeanor read as shallow and self-absorbed, but those are just small parts of her. As the series played out I saw many more facets like her drive and compassion. Even a small character like Connie isn't just a Christian stereotype there for a few laughs. The few moments she has give her character some breadth. Amy's unusual friendship with Krista is one I think I've only ever seen in Enlightened.

This show is the complete opposite of that, and it may make some uncomfortable. This show is about a woman who feels that she has been spiritually transformed and as a result feels the need to help transform others. Her emotional journey begins to reveal that she may not really be the new her after all. Laura Dern has played some very likable characters in the past, so it's hard to experience her being a character that can be so easy to dislike at times. You'd be hard pressed not to find someone in your office like her; well intentioned, but too self absorbed to know they're making others uncomfortable... often giving others something to talk about... perhaps uncovering the truth about others as a result? If you don't know someone like her, it's probably you. Funny in an all too true way. I loved it and intend to watch the whole series again soon.",1407110400,9,982,4.522471910112359

But, on the other hand, maybe it's going somewhere I can't see and will eventually reveal some poignant truths, such as ""we're all on the same journey doing the best we can with what we've got"" or, ""we're all enlightened by varying degrees, moreso in some areas than in others""...",1405987200,,579,4.576923076923077

4361479,5,B004EPYZCQ,"I ran across this series on Instantwatch, so decided to watch it, since it was a Laura Dern project. Fantastic. Original concept, plot, and dialogue. It's different from your ordinary sitcom. This series is about Amy (Laura Dern), who has a mental breakdown at the beginning of the series. After the breakdown she goes to an island getaway karma therapy resort, where she becomes, as the title states, ""enlightened."" At least SHE thinks so. But is she still the same OCD, mentally delicate person she was before, only her focus has changed from one thing to a different thing? Hard to say.  If you've ever seen an interview with Laura Dern, you will know that she is very different from this character, which makes her acting in this series all the more talented. She has created a delightful character with idiosyncracies, a distinctive way of speaking, and some not so good characteristics.  Many of the other characters are equally off kilter. The acting is terrific. Did I like the lead character? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Just like in real life. I thoroughly enjoyed this series and ended up binge watching it. If you like off the wall, independent-type series with strong female leads, I highly recommend this series. Luke Wilson and Diane Ladd round out the cast. Superb.

Though she played the character well, her character was annoying and frustrating, and I wish she could start one sentence without saying ""Hey"" first. She was pitifully ""unenlightened"" - most often, a complete ditz, sometimes selfish, a total dreamer and out of touch with reality.  But even so, I would recommend the series as it was well done and kept your interest as to what was going to happen next.

4361761,4,B004EPYZCQ,"I really enjoyed this series. I had never heard of it before. I don't watch TV on TV and don't get Showtime or HBO anyway. I found it through Amazon Prime and was very impressed with it. Laura Dern, Dianne Ladd, and Luke Wilson were all great and the supporting cast was also awesome (Mike White and Timm Sharp, and even Molly Shannon). I really liked how they juxtaposed the corporate mentality to the opposite world of nature and meditation. How one loses it so to say, stuck in the corporate mindset. However, there has to be a balance. You can't just stay out in the woods all day. I like how Laura Dern's character evolves even though I think I would have liked to see at least 2-3 episodes of how she was before she ""went away."" I like how the show shows each person has their own journey to enlightenment and for Laura Dern's character it is helping people and doing something for the greater good, while also realizing there are people in her life (her mother, ex-husband, co-workers) who don't revolve around her and have the same ideals as her. Overall- awesome two seasons. If they had thrown in a few earlier episodes of how Laura Dern was before, I think it could have been stretched to 3 seasons and I think it might have been more entertaining and drew people in. People like watching craziness and people deteriorating in a TV show. This show was kind of the opposite of a Breaking Bad- a main character growing stronger and more enlightened. So in that way it shows that people don't always want to see the evolution of man or woman to becoming a better person. Although that is what makes this show actually really good and unique, it also doesn't have the shock/entertainment value that some other dramas have had. But either way, I enjoyed it thoroughly and found it also a very enlightening show! It was also filmed extraordinary well.",1405036800,,1856,4.543283582089552
4361762,2,B004EPYZCQ,"Laura Dern's unquestionably skillful performance here is nonetheless tainted by her personal culpability in creating this ridiculous, new age treacle.

She sees a sea turtle underwater and takes it for a spiritual experience. Armed with a new attitude, she returns to her old life, which includes an emotionally unresponsive mother, a drug-addicted ex-husband, a corporate employer with the usual office politics, and all sorts of liberal causes that she'd like to help and has not the means to do so. The comedy comes in from the clash between her over-the-top but mostly misguided ideals and the real life people she interacts with, each of whom is looking out for number one.

4362046,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Love how honest the characters were.
The show kind of took a left turn in Season 2, but was still good.

I have some unanswered question I would love to see explored. What was Amy like for the 15 years she was a corporate buyer?
Where did she live before she moved in with her Mom?",1404172800,,281,4.017857142857143

4362048,5,B004EPYZCQ,"This won't appeal to everyone, I know. It's fun for me, however. A woman goes to treatment (in Hawaii) for a nervous breakdown, drugs & alcohol, has a spiritual ""awakening"" or so she thinks. She's still in the throws of addiction (without the drugs, not attending therapy or getting any ongoing recovery tools except what she's brought back with her.
That said, she's still selfish, self centered, etc. but is exploring what may help her in her quest for claiming a life worth living for herself. This is where it becomes more interesting. The star is adorable and a wonderful actress. She's looking for answers and her enthusiasm is great. She's sincere in her character, has a good heart really and I've found myself rooting for her, laughing at her, surprised by her perseverance and wacky roads on her path. This takes me away from my life for a half hour and I don't have to watch anyone killing anyone, politics, horrible other things.  It's my ""down time"". The other characters are also well portrayed and acted as well. I just really enjoy this one so am giving it five stars. The actors are great, the subject line pertinent to the times and I think others will enjoy it as well. Came across it quite by accident browsing Amazon's Prime TV section.

I'm sure most of us were squirming in our seats as we watched her character getting, yet again, slapped down for her efforts at finding purpose/satisfaction/happiness.
So many kudos to Ms. Dern for giving us a modern woman who is not wholly consumed with finding romance or ""being better than a man"" at her job!!!",1404086400,,368,4.676923076923077
4362084,5,B004EPYZCQ,Love this series and wish they'd gotten a third season. But the two seasons you can see on HBO are just first-rate. The acting:  Laura Dern and her mother Diane Ladd and the fantastic writer and actor Mike White are just superb. The rest of the cast are also wonderful--Luke Wilson!!,1404086400,,283,4.549019607843137

4362086,5,B004EPYZCQ,"I just discovered this gem of a show a few days ago when I was bored of my regular viewing and wanted to find something else, and, being a longtime fan of Laura Dern ( watch Citizen Ruth and Rambling Rose to know why ), I thought I'd give this a try. As of this writing, I'm about two-thirds of the way through the first of two seasons.

Dern plays Sue, a forty-year-old divorced woman, struggling to survive in the world of the Big Corporation, who has an emotional meltdown on the job after experiencing what pretty much amounts to sexual harassment at work. Off she goes to a holistic rehab/retreat place in Hawaii. She returns full of hopes, new coping skills, spirituality, and a desire to save the world and pass on the peace and love that she feels toward everyone.

Unfortunately, she has returned to a life of debt, having to live with her rather emotionally chilly and socially avoidant mother who is very confused about her daughter's new look on life, an ex-husband that's an addict and doesn't want to be saved, and a workplace that just, well, thinks she's a nut and has demoted her to a basement cube doing data entry alongside all the other office rejects. She also gradually discovers that she's a bit socially inept and fairly oblivious to the fact that most of the people she thought liked her really can't stand her, especially in the cutthroat workplace.

Armed with her new coping skills and spiritual outlook, which is primarily eastern in orientation ( yoga, meditation, mantras ), Sue tries to take on life, the workplace, and the world, believing that her newfound enlightenment can have the same healing effect on everyone else that it's had on her. Unfortunately, no one wants to hear it and everyone pretty much thinks she's even crazier and more annoying than she was before. She's an annoying, exasperating, and very lovable ( from the viewer's point of view ) character that quietly exposes her heart through her thoughts and feelings,  which we hear periodically via voiceover.

I have to say, I've grown quite fond of Sue, which leads me to my one complaint about this show: WHY THE HELL DID HBO CANCEL IT AFTER ONLY TWO SEASONS????? I think HBO really dropped the ball on this one. I guess in a world of real housewives and Honey Boo-Boo, this show and it's well-constructed characters are just too dull for the majority of the viewing public. They're ordinary people just like us, and I guess that's not enough these days.

But I thank Laura Dern and Mike White for creating this wonderful, sweet series. Too bad not enough people appreciated it.",1404086400,,2582,4.676211453744493
4362087,1,B004EPYZCQ,Not funny. Not ironic. Not intelligent. Painful to watch a seasoned actress (Laura Dern) try to overcome a lousy plot and script in the vain hope that this show would have the slightest chance to be watchable. Epic fail.,1404086400,,220,4.666666666666667
4362088,5,B004EPYZCQ,Miss Dern is superb. Very believable. Rapid fire viewing. I love this series. Refreshing.,1404086400,,89,5.428571428571429
4362089,3,B004EPYZCQ,"Fans of Laura Dern will b interested to learn her and her co-writer's take on life but every episode is painfully familiar. I can't recommend the series as a pleasurable experience though, not unless you need a reminder of the stinkiness you've participated in along the way. On the other hand, you'll probably recognize what Laura Dern is commenting on she's one of us.

Well, maybe your ways have always been better but, if so, I doubt you'll enjoy the series.",1404086400,,462,4.703703703703703

4362127,5,B004EPYZCQ,I loved this series! I thought the writer did an awesome job of revealing the inner thoughts of a tormented and often clueless person who wanted to fit into her professional world. She wanted success but also wanted meaningful contribution to this world. In a witty way the episodes show what can happen when you go against those in power.,1404000000,,339,4.666666666666667

4362129,5,B004EPYZCQ,"I like this show I feel equal parts frustration and empathy for her. We have all been in a position where people assume we are "" lesser than"" and other people play a part. It's sad to see her being belittled by people who each worked side-by-side ( and sometimes beneath her). I get frustrated when she's as nice to her former co-workers as she is but maybe she's just a "" kill em with kindness "" kinda gal.",1404000000,,407,4.1645569620253164

4362166,5,B004EPYZCQ,This is a very thought provoking show. It explores what happens to people who can't handle the stresses of life and what can happen. It's interesting to listen to her inner voice. The characters are varied and there are awkward work place relationships  that shift and change as the show goes on. Very entertaining!,1403827200,,315,4.833333333333333

4362168,5,B004EPYZCQ,"The ENLIGHTENED character played by Laura Dern can be found a little bit in all of us.

Amy is a pretty complex character, one scene you are pulling for her and then in another you detest her. I like the overall theme of the show, I def. enjoy the characters who work in the basement... Sad to know that there isn't a Season 3, because I do think the show has promise.",1403827200,,363,3.9863013698630136

4362171,4,B004EPYZCQ,"I think that Enlightened would be written off as a puff-piece failure if it did not have Laura Dern at the helm.  She plays the role of the unstoppable optimist with aplomb. I think most of us have worked with that annoying woman who is persistently happy, no matter how much detritus life throws at her. Now were talking consistently, obstinately, annoyingly HAPPY, no matter how honked-up her life is.  True, most of her failures are her own fault but isn't that true of all of us.  That's what makes this series so intriguing.

Amy Jellicoe is a 40-year old career woman who has just returned from a touchy-feely new age ""treatment center"" in Hawaii and wants only to save the rest of the world.  She returns to her old job where she's been having an affair with one of the higher-ups and though she regains reemployment, it's in the basement with a band of misfits.

She is living at home again with her mom, brilliantly played by Diane Ladd.  Mom has no sympathy for Amy's new found ""enlightenment"" and won't budge from her tried and true ""If you fall down, pull up your big-girl panties, and start all over again"".  Luke Wilson who plays her one time hubby is still the light bulb to Amy's moth.  He continues the bad habits of drinking, snorting and tomcatting that drove her away to begin with but he's still her soft place to land.

Dern plays the role with nuanced perfection which is what turns this series from a humdrum TV offering into a thought provoking and compelling winner.",1403740800,,1492,4.5543071161048685

4362254,4,B004EPYZCQ,"I'm only through the first season, but this show is written, acted, edited, and cast very well. Laura Dern is perfect as the well intentioned, but ineffective and often, oblivious, advocate for change. I'm sure many of us can relate to Amy's desire to right the wrongs in her workplace (and the world), but what we see is that being poorly informed and driven by emotions does not always get us what we want. I also appreciate that the shows end with insightful observations by Amy that don't get crushed by some sarcastic Hollywood ending.",1403740800,,540,4.6947368421052635

4362263,4,B004EPYZCQ,"This is a groundbreaking show in its own way - A light hearted clash of cultures and worlds. There is the old world of the system, the rules, the do or die, the stuff it, the numb out world of just getting through the day. Then there is the new world of letting yourself plunge into what you are feeling, and working to create a world in which it matters what people are feeling. The humor comes in because the main character not only lets herself feel it all, but she let's it all hang out, maybe not the best thing to do. But this is a comedy, so that is where the humor is coming from. I do like this show a lot. There is a serious message underneath the fun, that is we have to wake up and actually see, feel, taste, touch, smell, and decide if it is really what we want or not. It is a new guidance system for the human race that is developing. Hats off to Mike White and Laura Dern!",1403568000,,888,3.99438202247191

4362375,5,B004EPYZCQ,Loved the show. Laura Dern was great. Good to see her again. Simple show but a lot going on. Good supporting cast as well. Love Amazon Prime,1403395200,,140,4.222222222222222
4362376,4,B004EPYZCQ,I loved and could relate to how vulnerable and flawed the characters were in this depiction of the struggles in life.  Hoping for a third Season.,1403395200,,145,4.576923076923077

4362378,5,B004EPYZCQ,I watched Season one and two and now it's over I guess. It was engaging and funny. It really made me think what the heck am I doing to make this a better world. The acting was superb and of course real life mother and daughter didn't hurt.,1403395200,,239,4.0
4362379,5,B004EPYZCQ,Very uplifting film. Slow at first but quickly becomes interesting. I would like to see more films like this. Encore,1403395200,,116,4.85
4362380,5,B004EPYZCQ,Was enthralled by this miniseries. So well put together. From the opening scene where Amy (Laura Dern) is crying in the bathroom to the final scene where all comes together for sake of personal resolution and resolve for a greater cause. I'm a huge Laura Dern fan and have loved her for years and especially am fond of her performance in 'Citizen Ruth.' Another great performance throughout this wonderfully entertaining miniseries. Definitely worth seeing again.,1403395200,,463,5.1866666666666665

4362382,3,B004EPYZCQ,"I really couldn't decide if I'd recommend this show. There were elements I liked. A woman has a breakdown and tries to improve herself - very commendable.  It was the long speech-like monologues that grew tiresome for me.  I ended up enjoying the episodes that focused on the supporting characters ( Luke Wilson, Mike White, Dianne Ladd) more than the regular episodes.",1403308800,,369,4.935483870967742
4362383,5,B004EPYZCQ,"All I can say is: watch this. It's somewhat dark, but can seem uplifting if you miss the satire. This show satirizes the rehab and recovery movement, corporate America, people who work in IT, and California. It's an absolutely wonderful show. Not a false performance among this amazing cast. I have not finished watching season 2 because I don't want it to end. Please, just watch.",1403308800,,381,4.787878787878788

4362435,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Laura Dern plays the enlightened, but charmingly dingy heroine of this series.  Once you get to know the characters, the story line sucks you in like a vacuum.................making you wonder...what is Congentiva?  And why are all the misfits sent to the basement to work?  What is Abbadonn really selling?",1403308800,,307,5.224489795918367
4362436,5,B004EPYZCQ,I really enjoy this show.  The main character is so interesting because she does not see herself as others see her.  She truly walks to the beat of her own drum.,1403308800,,161,4.161290322580645

the story is sooo "" california"" but many of us out here in

we just don't go to Hawaii  to meditate or
do our yoga. Would enjoy more more from these 2.
Diane Ladd was also excellent- oh all of the acting -award winning

4362439,4,B004EPYZCQ,"This show is really interesting and unnervingly real, in a different way than anything else I've ever seen.  The main character is deeply, annoyingly flawed, but she also genuinely wants to become better and to effect change around her.  It can be sad, funny, uncomfortable, suspenseful, and inspiring.  As someone who meditates regularly and is, I guess, a skeptical new ager, it is really interesting to watch someone who engages in the practice of meditation but struggles with it (as most do) as the focus of a show.  I can see that this show is not for everyone, but I find it intriguing.",1403308800,,593,4.728155339805825

Laura Dern is great and this was a spectacular role for her, and the rest of the cast were terrific in thier perspective roles. I'm a big fan of overlaying the narrative before a scene and this series has plenty of it. Plus, the music was awesome and the writing was top-notch! It was such a pleasant surprise to come across this series, and I've been searching for more like it, but as of yet, can't find anything half as good as this was.",1403222400,,601,4.189655172413793

4362483,3,B004EPYZCQ,"When I first started watching the show, I was drawn to it & it's quirky characters. As the first season progressed, Amy, the main character, got into uncovering a conspiracy within the company she works, and the show focused more on that than the characters.

4362486,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Oh, this is a story that makes me nervous to see the protagonist try to work her way back from therapy. At times I scream at the screen to tell her to grow up, then I settle down and remember this is a movie. I enjoy the series and look forward to Season 2",1403222400,,256,3.759259259259259
4362487,3,B004EPYZCQ,"Enlightened should be ""endarkened"" ! Quite a different show and a little on the sad side because of the quandary the main character finds herself. It's an interesting story line and the writer does a good job, seeing as he's in the show also! The language is foul and some of the characters' lifestyles are questionable, but it's interesting and that's why I gave it 3 stars...I probably would not have watched it on TV, but on my Kindle Fire HDX, it's great!",1403222400,,459,4.542168674698795

4362489,2,B004EPYZCQ,"As much as I love Laura Dern her character in this show just becomes

becomes disappointing. I stopped after a few episodes. Maybe
it changes as it goes along but not fast enough for me",1403222400,,247,4.276595744680851
4362490,5,B004EPYZCQ,"One of the best shows I've seen in a long, long time.  Hard to believe it only lasted 2 seasons... the writing is awesome, the acting is extraordinary and the scenarios are easy to relate to.  Laura Dern is amazing in her role.  I'm sad there won't be any more episodes... I guess it's a little too cerebral for the dumbed down nation we have now.",1403136000,,347,4.2272727272727275

4362536,3,B004EPYZCQ,"The main character, Amy, is quite difficult for me to like and hard for me to look at. That being said she is still a fascinating, sickening and creepy creature that I cannot stop watching. She is no valiant do gooder hero but fully represents the way a corporate, ""soul-sucking"" work environment can push a naive narcissist into extreme values and then take that value system to the extreme. - In some ways I find it odd that I have this rather negative reaction to Amy, as I was in a similar real-life situation where I went up against a corporation I was working for as a whistle blower, was treated in some similar manner as portrayed in the series, by some of my co-workers, and ended up winning my case after a very emotionally draining two and a half years. Yet, what I find about this portrayal is she is consistently showing a deep-rooted narcissism that has supposedly been somehow resolved, or resolving..? and that conflict is not really brought to light in the portrayal of Amy. Instead there is this disconnect in the series where Amy is shown to be some whistle-blowing angel who may be a little intense, but she still is a ""tall, blonde and lovely"" woman who is just a bit naive about the ruthlessness of the hungry capitalistic world she has worked in for, (ahem), fifteen years...? Really??! I think it is this unfortunate disconnect that was partly the demise of the show.",1403049600,,1391,4.590361445783133

It's not one of those shows that's so good you'll watch an entire season in one night, but it's different and thought-provoking which is refreshing.

The main character is often annoying and painfully awkward, which she is meant to be. You can't help but feel sorry for her. The best part of this show is how real it is.  Most humans try so hard in life to make a difference; in themselves and the world and there will always be people who will stand in your way and just blatantly not give a s*** as much as you do.",1402876800,,668,4.2936507936507935

YET, it is hard not to like her because she has three important things in common with all of us: 1) a continual search for meaning, 2) a continual retinue of mistakes 3) keeping on,,because the alternative is unaccaptable.

I thought I just was interested because I saw myself in this, including awkward work situations involving truth and openness in a work environment. It was nice how it showed the real choices people make to be employed, be liked, be true to themselves and their world.  I'm an old gal and still believe we hurt others and ourselves when we compromise our ethics, our personal truth.  There are real sacrifices made if one chooses to be a totally ethical person.  Amy is totally recognizable.  Obviously there were other factors helped her keep her job, but I doubt they would have kept her in such a vulnerable position after she announced her truth and her passion. It was nave and rather dumb of her to be tipping her hand so loudly... but I think that was a reflection of  her positivity.  She expected them to see the light as she did and basically stop doing what made them money. The show reflects the ethical issues involved in our daily choices and how that reflects who we are.  So all of this is without the ""normal"" expectations of a show requiring an audience.  It is amazing that it actually survived as long a it did.

She wants to share her new found holistic however, she doesn't get the fact that she hasn't changed she has just traded booze for ""enlightenment""

It's a good series but sometimes touches too close to home. We've all been her and we've all been those that roll their eyes at her.

The humor is dark, and subtle, which I feel is a lost art these days. It's hard to find a comedy that isn't just shoving cheesy jokes in your face.
This show is also really sweet at times. It's heartbreaking and real, without being sappy.
They did a good job with the main character, she is self absorbed, annoying, and ditzy, but really good at heart so she ends up serving as a sort of role model for the viewer.",1402617600,,618,4.2905982905982905

4362765,4,B004EPYZCQ,"I think that this show has flown under the radar of most folk, and as such is very nice surprise.  As it is only 2 seasons, it's not a huge time investment and you get a full story with an ending.

To me, the main themes of the show are the plight of the ""insignificant"" in a corporate setting and the need for people to find significance and importance in their lives.  Of course, these themes are in the background and the makers aim to tell an entertaining story first.

Overall, I thought the show looked great, the music was haunting, and the acting excellent.  I came away from episodes having laughed but also feeling melancholy.  You don't always like or agree with the main protagonists, but their actions don't feel overly contrived.  Anytime a show evokes emotion from me is a success in my book.",1402617600,,807,4.486301369863014

Laura Dern was phenomenal playing that person who is slightly annoying and almost uncomfortable to watch at times when she just can't help herself. Yet, she isn't the cheesy Steve Carrel character. (I did love the Office) I was so looking forward to several seasons of this show. According to everything I've read, shows starring women as leads have a much harder time because even though women watch shows staring men. Men do not return the favor. Shame! I know a few guys who agreed that this was a great and very different show, not the same old crap we are served regularly. I was really hoping Netflix would pick this show up.

4362941,2,B004EPYZCQ,"A good cast, a wonderful star, a good premise. So, what happened? A strong writing team is one thing, but sometimes the one left out is the editor. I had high hopes, but this is just a neurotic character trying too hard with all the stuff she thinks will work, but her ""enlightenment"" only makes her more of the same: clueless, self-involved, utterly seflish; but with her already screwed up world view, her long swim in the warm waters of New Age transformation, she gains self-righteousness, omnipotence, and a superiority complex that won't quit. This is meant to be funny, but it isn't enough to sustain interest. I can do without a second season, thank you.",1402012800,9,662,4.7155172413793105

4362998,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Although somewhat hyper real, this wonderful drama from Mike White and Laura Dern is a magnificent tapestry of tongue in cheek parody and profound commentary on the experience of being human in the modern era.  As ""Enlightened"" unfolds, the viewer is given glimpses into the world of various characters and it is easy to see ourselves or someone we know in many of them.  I saw myself in ""Amy"" (played by Laura Dern) - as her in your face idealism serves as a vehicle for many cringe worthy social interactions with other characters.

4363002,4,B004EPYZCQ,"Season 1 is wonderful  and funny (season 2 is not as good - probably why the show was cancelled). I recommend watching it. The main character is a selfish, wounded, needy woman with a spiritual bent, who is always sabotaging herself. Her lack of real self-awareness leads to some really humorous scenes.

I have just read that she leaves the world after season 2.  HBO cancelled a 3rd season.  Why!?  To make room for another sex meets serial killer series?  Really HBO, consider reconsidering.  This is a character that takes more than a season or two for the necessary fan base to develop.  I just found it.

A very different show; some situations seem real while others totally off the wall and unbelievable, but always entertaining and well acted. An intriguing mix of pain and hilarity.

The theme of the show is very serious, but from this episode and the capsules of those that follow, this is pathos that does not deliver any sense of catharsis.  In that sense it is superficial. If the point is that she has not really changed in her understanding of the world, and she is only spinning her wheels trying to make the world fit her expectations, that is not enough for a show or an episode, maybe the first scene of the first act of a play. Her relationships with former partner and mom are genuine and I have a sense she will move on.

I love this show and would have been so happy if Mike White would have had the chance to conclude Amy's story in season 3 which did not happen.

4363205,5,B004EPYZCQ,"Season one of HBOs new gem of a show Enlightened follows heroine (anti-heroine?) Amy Jellicoe (Laura Dern), after a very public (and quite funny, in a sad way) meltdown at work, and a stint at a holistic cult-like rehabilitation center, as she tries to live an enlightened and positive life, despite the numerous curve balls thrown at her from all possible angles.
Jellicoe is a difficult character. Shes likable sometimes, and extremely fake and eye-roll inducing at others. The first time we see her is at an emotionally charged low in her life, and we know exactly what this woman is capable of, even though we cheer her efforts to change, the initial question remains  do people REALLY have the capacity to change? In my opinion, the characters that are best-written aren't likable. Theyre complicated and capable of dramatic highs and lows.

Mike White and Laura Dern co-created Enlightened together, and Dern has always had a liking for playing damaged and complicated characters. So imagine what she does when she has the mother-child relationship with her character. Jellicoe is an onion, with layers being peeled away in each (too-short) 30-minute episode.

But thats a problem. Why is Enlightened given the 30-minute length of a comedy? While it certainly has its moments of great humor and comedic insight, its by no means a laugh-out-loud comedy. Its much more interesting if you don't approach it as a comedy, but as a drama with comedic elements. Its interesting to think what the writers could have done if each show was an hour long. In the end, its about a characters journey to self-fulfillment, despite all the terrifying insanity around her, some of which she is responsible for.

In a standout episode, Consider Helen, we see Jellicoes mother (played by Derns real life mother, Diane Ladd), and the struggle that shes been through in her life, and the quiet anger and regret that she holds within her, that she doesnt care to talk about. This rare episode, from another characters perspective, adds a fresh layer to the story, and makes everything that happens thereafter a bit more interesting.

At the end of the first season of Enlightened, we leave Jellicoe in a place where the truth has hit her in the face. Shes at a crossroads and she has two paths to choose from  the right, which would jeopardize her job, her family and everything about her life thats safe and secure, or the wrong, which would allow for poker-faced, unquestioning simplicity to rule her life. What does she choose? Stay tuned for season two of Enlightened.",1391990400,3,2556,4.891454965357967

4363228,2,B004EPYZCQ,"Entertainment: 2 star

The acting on this show is brilliant, well casted, and well done.  Unfortunately all the characters are ultimately unlikable.  I'm not a fan of the writing or directing here.  The pace is often too slow, and the plot often becomes uncomfortable to watch.  It a pure drama, without any comedic breaks, other that the parts that are so sad and pathetic you either have to laugh or cry.  It was more entertaining than doing nothing on my train ride to work, but not by much.

Enlightenment: no stars

Given the subtext of ""this is the new face of tranquility"" I would guess that the title is pure sarcasm.  With the opening scene of Dern crying in the bathroom I thought it would be a ripoff of Eat, Pray, Love, but not so, she never makes it to the eat stage.  The voice over self talk that is meant to be deep and profound is neither, it's just corny and annoying.  Nothing uplifting, inspiring, or profound to be found here...

The show is often very funny but also might spur identification in those of us who would like to be more spiritually in tune with life and the world.  It is about a very unenlightened woman whose job crisis spurs a moment of true vision, but who then veers back and forth, sometimes maniacally so, between despair and a few, if scintillating, moments of enlightenment.  My husband thought that the character played by Laura Dern was annoying, but even he was riveted by the season finale.

4363299,4,B004EPYZCQ,"The majority of TV watchers actually love shows like ""Friends"", ""Dancing with the Stars"" & ""Two & a Half Men"". If you're one of the rare few who gets ""Curb your Enthusiasm"", the first 3 seasons of ""The Office"", ""Flight of the Conchords"" & of course ""Office Space"", you will revel in the challenging & bizarre ""Enlightened"".
It dares to have complicated characters, that you like, hate, sometimes fear & also hope for. Not only does ""Enlightened"" skewer our corporate culture with its fake smiles, secret loathings and high school cliques, but it also rips into the new age culture that is so prevalent in Southern California--right now! Lots of cringe humor here, also moments where you just cringe, as Laura Dern launches herself like a guided missile at the wrong person at the wrong time. I certainly recognize the massage therapist who wants to tell you about all the poisons in your food. The earnest friend who is all about truth & ""being present"", then flakes when something important is needed.

This show touches on the truths of our times, & deals with the small people that most of us actually are, not the fantasy superheroes, secret agents or rocketeers of our collective escapist fantasies. Some episodes feel claustrophobic like a family reunion that streches on too long, while others are sharp & snappy. Laura Dern can carry the show practically single-handedly, due to her expressive face that, ever since ""Blue Velvet"" in 1986,  show rage, agony & sadness better than any other actress around. Mike White is like a Zen presence, casually commenting, generally underplaying in his role.

Dern's new boss is hilarious, acting like the basement work is important, while slacking off constantly himself.
Luke Wilson is laid-back, but a funny contrast to Dern's ""I want to save my friends, & the world--immediately"" vibe.
Highly recommended to those who enjoy a complicated character study without easy answers, & value quality over mass popularity. I'm sad there are only 2 seasons of ""Enlightened"", but glad that this show exists at all.",1368662400,4,2053,4.979591836734694

Dern is amazing in it as are all the supporting cast.

4363435,2,B004EPYZCQ,"I have watched this show the 1st season (forced myself to stay with it), and I am finishing up on the 2nd season (only because of Tyler, Levi and other performances).  I think every character is compelling, but the central character (Amy - Dern).  Her selfish, self-righteous and childish behavior takes away from the show's message and from the performance of the other characters.  I love Tyler, Levi, her mother and the other characters, because they seem genuine and real - you really understand their pain and conflict.  The only time Dern seemed genuine was during her melt-down.  After that, she was transformed into an air head who spends her time lecturing everyone on how they should feel and react.  Her performance seems amateurish and awful as she makes her silly tormented faces and tries to look conflicted.
I expect Amy to be flawed and not likeable, but she should at least be a believable character.  It is blatantly obvious that she is hiding behind her ""I am trying to save the world"" by deliberately destroying other people in order to seek revenge for what happened to her at work.  It would be great if Dern played her character as a real person with the complexity and depth that the other actors bring to their characters.
I think the producers of the show should seriously redefine how Dern plays this character instead of blaming viewers for not being interested in the show itself. There are many shows on HBO, where the characters are complex and not likeable, but we believe and understand them even if we do not agree with how they deal with their life and other people (ex:  Boardwalk Empire).",1362268800,7,1625,4.73404255319149
4363436,5,B004EPYZCQ,"I knew nothing about this show until I heard Mike White and Laura Dern on NPR's radio show ""Fresh Air.""  Mike White (writer, creator, and actor playing ""Tyler"") described how the idea of the show came from his own breakdown during a stressful period working on another TV show.  He spoke thoughtfully about his connection with Eastern religion and philosophy (striking given his father's involvement in fundamentalist Christianity as a ghostwriter for Jerry Falwell, and his subsequent evolution into a gay rights activist), and about the challenge of becoming an agent for change.  I liked his honest and self-aware answers to Terri's questions, as well as Laura's zeal for playing a complex and visionary female character, so I was curious enough to check out ""Enlightened.""

Strangely enough, I watched episode 2 first, not the pilot, and absolutely fell in love (I think the pilot, while not bad, is one of the weaker episodes, so please don't judge the whole series based on it alone).  This is a challenging but deeply moving show, which was like catnip for someone who is easily bored by predictable, feel-good characters and storylines bearing little semblance to reality.  I devoured the rest of the episodes, and promptly purchased the season 1 DVD as soon as it was released.  It is absolutely wonderful, and by far the best DVD purchase I have made in years.  There are short segments with Mike White explaining his thoughts about each episode, as well as episode commentaries.  My favorite episode and commentary is #9, ""Consider Helen.""  Hearing Laura Dern (who plays Amy) and her real-life mother Diane Ladd (who plays Amy's mother Helen) reminiscing about their own very different relationship, while discussing the relationship of their fictional characters, was an absolute treat.  They could both teach master classes in acting, with incredibly rich and nuanced performances in all of the episodes.  Mike White is wonderful as Tyler, Timm Sharp is hilariously douche-y as Dougie, and Luke Wilson manages to evoke even more pathos as Levi than he did in as Richie in The Royal Tenenbaums.

While Enlightened doesn't have the easy impact of graphic sex and violence in Girls, Breaking Bad, Homeland, Mad Men, and other highly regarded shows, it achieves the much more difficult task of using the simple tools of words, emotions, and relationships to portray the desperate loneliness of contemporary American society better than any other TV show I've seen.  And it does this with a protagonist whom you want to strangle half the time, for being so self-absorbed, socially tone-deaf, and irritating.  But what Mike White does, better than anyone else on TV right now, is to show you the secret humanity shining from the hidden depths of each loser, ghost, and lost soul.  I can't think of another show that has a more emotional, resonant effect on me, and I say with all seriousness that it's better than pretty much anything else on TV right now (sadly overlooked by most, given its shamefully low viewer numbers).  It's among the greatest works of art I've experienced.  If you're an introvert, then you'll definitely ""get it.""

With the exception of the one episode devoted to Diane Ladd's character (Helen), I found these episodes awkward and off-putting. Dern's character is a flighty self saboteur who does nothing at work and is chronically late. She fails at every level to get why this is annoying. The character humiliates herself over and over again.

I think the acting is terrific and Dern is giving this 100%. Ladd's performances are gems. I found nothing redemptive in season 1 nor any take away. I found myself thinking of terrible employees and co-workers I've had and a lot of them were like Amy.

Come to think of it, I did like a second episode about a yoga instructor (Sandy) who was visiting Amy. That was an engaging story line and not unlike a lot I've seen in the yoga world.

I can't say I'd  buy season 2;maybe if I heard whether the show allowed the character to have some success or at least minor amounts of self awareness. Maybe.",1361750400,3,1040,4.457894736842105

I was a little late to the train station on this one - happened to watch a marathon on HBO during the summer.  Wasn't sure how I felt about it for the first several episodes because it was just so DIFFERENT.  Sometimes I hated the protagonist (played like a STRADIVARIUS by the wonderful LAURA DERN), sometimes I rooted for her, and eventually I cried with her, laughed with her.

Incredible WRITING, DIRECTING, ACTING, everything.  It's all played to the bone.

Masterful supporting cast including LUKE WILSON, who is hot again, by the way, and delivering his best performance since ""The Royal Tenenbaums"".  Also, TIMM SHARP (""Underclared""), Mike White (""School of Rock"", ""Freaks & Geeks), Diane Ladd (""Wild at Heart"").

4363442,4,B004EPYZCQ,"Its been argued that the we're living in the Golden Age of TV. Laura Dern's ""Enlightened"" certainly is part of it.

My first reaction to the first couple of episodes of this show is that it provided too many juicy opportunities to pass up for easy scorn and scoffing at LA-LA-Land New Age style faux-progressivism and middle class neurosis of the sort first identified by the old New Left theorists over four decades ago (think Herbert Marcuse and Guy Debord). And so it does. The main character played by Dern is such a cliche of these patterns that she could be taken for a mistrel show rendering of them. Dern's performance is masterful in everything from the grating empathy of her Vally Girl vocal patterns to the contorted expressions of deep concern for others' sufferings evident in her ever-twisted face. Her passion for self-help, positive thinking books and grandiose plans to save the planet by changing from within the culture of the trans-national consumer products corporation for which she works adds to the hilarity of her New Age enlightenment. To say nothing to the bill presented by her Hawaiian asrham for its priceless contribution to that enlightenment equivalent to a year's tuition at Harvard.

It nonetheless becomes clear in ""Enlightenment"" that the profound shallowness of the culture and approach the main character takes to her own and the world's problems are the only tools she has for beginning to grapple with them. She (and we) really are trapped in a ruthless and irresponsible global capitalist world order, against which any effective push-back is increasingly difficult. That the most intimate personal relationships in this kind of world fracture under the pressures of ambition, despair and disappointment. And that trying to make even small changes to make this Brave New World more humane can make one seem (and even actually become!) maladjusted to the point of insanity. The brilliance of ""Enlightened"" is its engagement and expose of this world in a comic and real way that is never overly polemical, heavy-handed or didactic. It's one of the best things on TV in recent years, and one example of why we live in the Golden Age of television.",1361145600,2,2187,4.989041095890411

The subject matter itself is unlike anything I've encountered on TV, basically:

* A person trying desperately to change the world by changing herself
* A person doing so with almost no support system.

Anyone who has ever moved to a new city alone, gone through a divorce, made a tough change in life, or tried to re-forge broken family ties can relate to this show. Her mom can't really see she's changed; her ex is so self destructive and lost that he can't help her; most people at her workplace are hostile or downright abusive. She faces a pack of ""mean girls"" in her office who can smell her vulnerability and take glee is knocking her down at every opportunity.

The piece that is less than believable is Amy's age. She behaves much like a woman in her 20s (possibly early 30s) --  but definitely not her 40s. She's naive, kind of ignorant, and seems to be utterly clueless of corporate protocol. Given that this character supposedly had a successful career before her ""enlightenment"", it's very hard to believe she'd make some of the blunders she does. She's very childlike, and she simply wouldn't have risen up in that company without more street smarts.

4363532,5,B004EPYZCQ,"This is an immensely entertaining and moving show that feels far more expansive than its 28 minutes per episode. It features hilarious attempts to squelch rage alongside a sincere overture at making changes in life. I watched three or four episodes at a time and am thankful HBO renewed it for a second season.

A woman has a very public breakdown in corporate culture and comes back from a holistic retreat, renewed and aglow with good intentions.

From afar, I thought ""Enlightened"" would be a one-trick pony, mining the world of self-help and New Age hippy-dippiness for cringe-inducing comedy--I think part of the undeserved low ratings for this show can be attributed to the title. But, in fact, it's a very generous show. No one is reduced to a caricature, least of all Laura Dern's Amy, and the comedy comes not from a cringe factor but from the discrepancy in her intention and end result. Yes, at one moment Amy looks, on paper, like a crazy stalker with poor impulse control, but really we know she just wants to talk and unfortunately happens to be a bad driver. It is absurd and real all at once, and very easy to watch. Sometimes Amy is hapless and over the top in her efforts at sunny optimism, but she's no fool and doesn't remain a joke to her former colleagues for long, as underlying it all, she speaks the truth.

Dern is wonderful and there's a rich supporting cast. I especially like her tender but infrequent relationship with her ex-husband Levi (Luke Wilson). They have a simple but heartbreaking backstory. And then there is her work situation, which I could not enjoy more. She's been demoted to the bowels of her company to do some sort of processing or data entry work with other sad sacks like Mike White under the purview of a juvenile, testosterone-addled boss. There is one scene where she is about to get called in, perhaps to be fired, and she goes from person to person, trying to discern what it is they do down there. I could watch it 10 times.
