8595987,2,B00DPJEWC0,"I have seen seven other Mellville movies. I heard that he was not satisfied with this film, and it is quite understandable. Probably the worst of the eight movies that I have seen by him. I was very curious about this movie, but as the say, curiosity killed the cat. The film seems so amateurish, you would never have thought that Mellvile had ever made a film before. I have usually been a fan of Mellviles hard boiled black and white movies, but cannot in any way recommend it. There is a nice song to listen to, and that is supposed to happen at Capitol records, which is really the highlight of the film. The film is just mostly a lifeless, boring film, with no one to really care about. In some of Mellvilles other films, that has not been the case.",1438473600,,754,4.316901408450704

8595990,3,B00DPJEWC0,"As a devoted Melville fan, I enjoyed this modest mystery yarn very much. Some location exteriors were shot in NYC, but the rest was made in France, and there are some entertaining inaccuracies. The interior of a nightclub is downright unAmerican and there are little glitches such as calling a hospital The Roosevelt Hospital, which would only be called Roosevelt Hospital. Melville himself plays one of the leads and he's a most engaging presence.",1417392000,,448,5.0675675675675675
8595991,3,B00DPJEWC0,"It's fun to gape at 1960s NYC; the cameras were on the street filming ordinary citizens caught in the headlights.  The story was a bit too cynical for me.  The photographer, one of the two men in manhattan, behaved hideously.",1409184000,,225,4.6
8595992,4,B00DPJEWC0,"Jean-Pierre Melville loved American Film Noir. His attraction to this distinct genre is the impetus behind TWO MEN IN MANHATTAN, now gloriously restored and presented by the Cohen Film Collection.

Melville is so devoted to his vision that he even plays one of the principal roles, a weary-looking newspaper reporter whobecause of his heavy-lidded eyesbears a certain resemblance to Robert Mitchum. Melville is no Mitchum when it comes to acting, though, and his performance is only partly successful.

Pierre Grasset as near-alcoholic photographer Delmas is the more interesting of the two main characters. It is his dilemma at the end of the film that strongly suggests that he is the true protagonist and his what the heck laugh in the films final seconds will stay with you once the film is over.

As an homage to Film Noir, there is bound to be a lot of familiarity in the plot and style of the film. While perhaps inescapably spilling into clich at times, the film is still mesmerizing to watch, in large part because of Its on location footage of New York City. Clich is often the result of meeting audience expectation, which one is obliged to do in any film defined by its genre, so one can be forgiving if certain stretches seem awfully familiar (the chanteuse girlfriend, the visit to the strip clubwith nudity, not common for 1959, the year the film was made).

While the film hasn't aged as well as Melville might have hoped, there is still much to applaud. One need look no further than the excellent and enlightening conversation between critics Jonathan Rosenbaum and Ignatiy Vishsnevetsky for genuine insight into the film.",1397433600,4,1640,4.888489208633094
8595993,4,B00DPJEWC0,"Saw this movie at a Film Noir series I went to. Right from the start I loved it. Being a big Noir fan this movie fits the bill. Amazing black and white with the grittiness of the 50's New York. Subtitles don't bother me, but if someone doesn't like them this may not be for them. Absolutely loved the movie and am happy to have it in my Film Noir library. A real noir classic",1395964800,,375,4.013333333333334
8595994,5,B00DPJEWC0,"I grew up in NYC in the late 1950's-1960's, and it was so much fun to see scenes shot in the City well before this time.  Real film noir style cinematography; good acting; some intrigue; provides opportunity to see people and places in the seedy grimy side of NYC (Times Square and 42nd Street/Hell's Kitchen area); violence, murder and mayhem, but all in all, very satisfactory and interesting to watch! And, best of all, a concious awakening and redemption spirit is alive, even in the most opportunistic of men! Hence, I rate this Five Stars!",1389657600,,545,4.7368421052631575

8595996,5,B00DPJEWC0,"I ordered this movie and watched it today.

What a great looking movie...................only James Wong Howe's great camera work on Sweet Smell of Success rivals this breathtakingly beautiful film.  I may be really biased, but to me Melville ranks with greatest directors of the 20th century......I love film noir and no other director making films outside the USA captures the spirit and fun of American crime films of the 40's and 50's.

Melville plays one of the two leads in this film, and he is very good......there is not much of a plot.....this is an exercise in style, and believe me Melville pulls it off with panache.

There is a Quinten Tarantino blurb on the box that says Melville is to the crime film as Sergio Leone is to the western..............so true; however, Leone was more successful because he lucked into Clint Eastwood.

I would give this ten stars if I could...............the movie is a highest recommendation possible.",1379376000,3,947,4.968354430379747
