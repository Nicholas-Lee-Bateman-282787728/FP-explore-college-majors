8396631,5,B003GXE9W8,"Buckley's powerful intellect is only matched by his charming temperament, which combine to produce some of the most interesting and entertaining discussion that has ever been on television.  The deterioration of political discourse into rancorous yelling matches filled with personal attacks and bumper sticker talking points, conducted by uninformed twits on social media, is a sad and dangerous societal development.  Buckley's good temper, genuine intellectual curiosity, and probing questions remind us of the way civilized discourse on important matters should be conducted.  If only we had television shows like this today.  Absolutely wonderful in every way.",1457568000,,665,5.895833333333333

8396636,5,B003GXE9W8,"This is a thorough discussion on the nature of thinking among the intellectual elites and I do mean thorough. Paul Hollander and Ernest Van den Haag basically are summarizing their findings on the subject.

The most intriguing points made go beyond political philosophy and delve into human nature. The 'intellectuals' claims Van den Haag lack a sense of importance in a freer democratic society and that they would be awarded more prestige and power in a totalitarian state as an idea person. This is only part of the discussion on why 'intellectuals' in the West so often look at totalitarian states and take the propaganda emitting from their politburo, literally.

The ""intellectuals' feeling contempt for having to share an equal vote with someone who has an inferior IQ to their own is also discussed as well as the refusal of these thinkers to accept or the need to rationalize atrocities in communist states (Chomsky's refusal for years to accept the mass slaughter of Cambodians under Poi Pot as one example, Mary McCarthy preferring to think a mass slaughter in a Vietnamese town being done by the US Air Force than the Vietcong are two examples discussed)

Other aspects of the discussion move into, a general dissatisfaction with ones own country (the grass is always greener on the other side thinking) and how a different philosophy is longed for. A major point is how intellectuals have publicly praised revolutionary leaders prior to the full information of their acts and aims are disclosed (Mailer's praise for Castro in '61 and the professors in Princeton during Castro's visit prior to the Cuban missile crisis), This ignorance is also discussed as being born from a lack of experience. A person cannot fully appreciate freedom until they do not live in a genuinely free society.

As I said, this discussion is thorough. There are no emotional outbursts or sniping in present day TV commentary which is probably why some other reviewers found this discussion so banal.",1398643200,3,1988,4.996978851963746
8396637,5,B003GXE9W8,"Paul Hollander and Ernest Vanden Haag in a discussion of the flaws of leftist political philosophy. The left continues to ignore the atrocities of Stalin, Mao, Castro, etc. just as it was doing at the time this discussion was recorded.

8396639,2,B003GXE9W8,"I absolutely hate giving bad reviews on interviews, documentaries, etc. because I know they come from a good place which is to educate people on matters and ideas they may not be familiar with. But I mean this in all sincerity, I couldn't watch more than 10minutes of this. Not because I don't believe it has anything to offer. But because the interviewees (esp. Hollander) have such monotone and low voices that I can't even catch his/their points. It is really important that people have inflection when they speak because it is extremely difficult to listen to and understand without it. But I DO recommend reading Hollanders books. So truly my criticism would have to be on their delivery. It just isn't very bearable and I say that as a person who is used to hugely boring courses and seminars. If I could get through that I'm sure there's much to gain from the content of this interview.",1387152000,,893,4.658227848101266
