5105279,5,B007RAS350,"This is the best way to have these horror movies! Blu ray in a quintuple set! A Canadian box set, with Insidious, The Others, The Blair Witch Project, 1408, and The Last Exorcism! Placed inside a fancy slipcase that's sturdy and die-cut to be like a leatherbound book! I can't find this collection in the bargain bins. There are no digital HD copies, however. Too good a deal to care.",1438387200,3,384,4.5

5105281,5,B007RAS350,"The best horror anthology/collection on blu ray bar none. Every movie looks and sounds great, and if you can get this for less than $15, its an absolute steal. Not a single movie is terrible, but Blair Witch does not have the punch it once did (it created the found footage sub-genre  so it can be forgiven). 95/100",1426377600,2,315,4.431034482758621

5105284,4,B007RAS350,"One or two classics yet-to-be and a couple of classy but not so classic films.  Good buy.  One classic is THE OTHERS.  You pick the other!

These are the actual Blu Ray releases bundled together so they have all the extras that the single disc versions have minus the individual covers.",1412208000,11,286,4.549019607843137
5105285,5,B007RAS350,This collection is a steal. I'm always looking for deals on blu-rays and this is one of the best I've found. Any of the five movies in this anthology is worth the purchase price. Very high caliber horror/ thrillers.,1407456000,7,215,4.538461538461538
5105286,5,B007RAS350,"All of the movies on this Blu Ray were a critical success. Usually a combo pack like this would only have one or two decent movies and then a few bad ones, but this anthology is a pretty sweet deal.",1402531200,3,198,3.975
5105287,4,B007RAS350,4/5 movies were great (I don't like exorcism movies but that's the price to pay with the other 4 I wanted.) Nothing too special about this set. Mine came in a faux leather slip on.,1467331200,,180,4.171428571428572

5105292,5,B007RAS350,"Excellent collection of first rate horror films on Blu Ray, however, the collection purchased through seller ""Two Thumbs Up"" had a defective disc. A strange green line with Asian figures ran across the screen of The Last Exorcism. Insidious and The Blair Witch Project were fine. I didn't bother to check The Others and 1408 since I already had one bad disc. I've returned that collection and ordered a replacement through ""Outlet Promotions"". On the positive side the collection is housed in a sturdy and attractive case. Check your discs before your return/replacement options expire! If the replacement order contains playable discs I'll edit this review to 5 stars.
*Update 1-11-16*
Received set from ""Outlet Promotions"" and all discs play fine. All discs have numerous bonus features and language/audio options. In addition to the sturdy and attractive case this collection is housed in an embossed, jazzy thick cardboard slipcase too, very nice. So if your set arrives without the cardboard slipcase you probably got a customer return.
Note: I've noticed a distinct slip in quality control with my Amazon purchases during the last year. From damaged cases to bad discs to unreliable two day shipping I've also discovered better pricing and availability in some cases from stores like B*st B*y and W*lmart.",1452211200,9,1311,5.188679245283019

This is a great set with five great thriller scary films.  I hope they come out with more like this set.  It's also definitely worth the price.

8521314,4,B007RAS350,"This Anthology contained 5 Thrillers/Horror Movies: Insidious (Favorite); The Others; Blair Witch Project; The Last Exorcism; and 1408. The First Three Movies Were My Favorites, the Last Two I Could Do Without. I was originally just looking to buy Insidious because but I saw this and it was a far better value! In my opinion, you can't go wrong with this set...even if you only like two of the movies, the price can't be beat! WalMart currently has it listed at: $31.97...I paid less than $10.00 because I have Prime w/ free shipping. October 2016",1476835200,,548,4.778947368421052

The image Amazon used for the product shows a blue case...It comes in an all black case. In which I thought it wasn't a legit copy. I've been reassured by Barry the reasoning. Anyway, this is a great product for the price. I actually got it just for Blair Witch Project , since the single version wasn't available at that time. Eventually I'll get one so I can have the packaging for it.",1470614400,,544,4.396039603960396
