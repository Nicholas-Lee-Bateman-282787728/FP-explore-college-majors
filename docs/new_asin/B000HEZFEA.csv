8139686,1,B000HEZFEA,This DVD was not worth the money spent on the purchase. The techniques presented were not professionally done or presented in a detail manner. Ms Davis more or less outlined how she accomplished making the free form fabric rather than actually demonstrating the knitting techniques. She would generally point out where she picked up stitches or where she increased or decreased but never demonstrated a single technique in terms of actually how to make various shapes. In my opinion this is a poor quality DVD and a total waste of money,1431475200,,536,4.9010989010989015
8139687,3,B000HEZFEA,"I purchased this DVD hoping to get some inspiration for teaching Freeform to knitters who are scared to knit without a pattern to follow.

This is a tutorial on creating Freeform using three basic ""patterns"" called Curvy, Patchy and Bulgy. This does give the Freeformphobic a chance to break away from a sweater pattern and begin to experiment. You can use these patterns to create endless combinations for your own unique style of Freeform.

However Freeform in the truest sense is making it up as you go. You knit a few stitches and then wonder, what if I: increase, decrease, just keep adding yarn overs, knit into the same stitch 30 times, bind off and pick up from this corner with a new texture, color, stitch, etc. You play with the knitting, not really knowing where it's taking you and then you find in the end you have created something uniquely your own. Of course you can use some of your favorite stitches and stitch combinations to enhance your design but it's not driven by having to use a particular pattern over and over. The more you create, the more creative you become!

Get this DVD if freeform scares you and you feel you really need a pattern but after you have developed confidence to experiment just try playing with stitches and see what YOU can invent.",1363910400,3,1279,4.6255506607929515
8139688,5,B000HEZFEA,"This is a complete and very well done DVD on the art of Freeform Knitting.
Colleen Davis is a meticulous knitter, talented teacher as well as artist.
She presents the basics of this art in a clear matter as well as inspiring the knitter to continue. The photos are easy to follow, the samples turn out well. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to start and pursue this fantastic form of knitting. You can do it easily with the methods presented by Colleen Davis.",1202688000,15,474,4.459770114942529
