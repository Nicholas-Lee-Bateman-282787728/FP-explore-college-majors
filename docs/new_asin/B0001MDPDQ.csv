2014268,5,B0001MDPDQ,"Watching this video almost bought me to tears.  I feel so blessed to be a fan of Luthers.  I miss him and continue to mourn for the music we didn't get a chance to hear from him, this will make me treasure what he did give us all the more.  The video bought back many old memories and like many other, Luthers music has gotten me through many lonely times.  He was and will always be a true musical treasure.",1126483200,17,408,4.0625
2014269,5,B0001MDPDQ,"This DVD covers such a wide range of Luther's career and vocal excellence. It gives fans of  all ages of the LUTHER era an opportunity to see him as they remember him best.

We get an unending glimpse into the heart of a legend through some of his greatest hits and performances and appreciate the gift.

Thanks, Luther, for the gift.",1126051200,12,334,4.442622950819672
2014270,5,B0001MDPDQ,Many of these videos I didn't even know he made.  Loved the dvd. Excellent for Luther fans.,1124496000,13,91,4.352941176470588
2014271,5,B0001MDPDQ,"I have been a huge Luther Vandross fan for years. What a wonderful way to see Luther again, and hear him.  I especially enjoyed ""There's Nothing Better Than Love"", the duet he did with Gregory Hines. It's probably one of my favorites. I had been listening to it alot lately on my CD's, but had never seen their performance before. It's really hard to believe that both of these extremely talented gentlemen are no longer with us. I really agree that no one else I've heard could take a song and make it their own like Luther seems to have done. The end song of him singing ""A House is Not a Home"" with Dionne Warwick in the audience is a show stopper. Thank heavens he will live on with his music forever.",1123891200,12,705,4.3007518796992485
2014272,5,B0001MDPDQ,i purchased this dvd for the duet with mariah carey....wow i got more than just that....well spent dollar...,1123545600,4,108,5.055555555555555
2014273,5,B0001MDPDQ,"For any true Luther fan this is the DVD to have for sure.

Although some clips are featured from his other live shows

at Wembley and Albert Hall. Bonus feature performance of ' House is not a Home' Sees a young good looking luther belt out this song like never before at some awards show, to me that video

alone was worth the entire DVD. Yes Luther is a superstar

and so amazing!!! Ven Melbourne Australia",1123545600,5,408,4.328947368421052

THIS DVD SHARES WITH YOU ALL OF HIS VIDEOS IN A NUT SHELL, CREATING A PRIVATE CONCERT WITH JUST YOU AND LUTHER IN YOUR VERY HOME.  IT'S CLOSE, QUIET, PERSONAL, ROMANTIC, AND VERY SATISFYING......TRUST ME.",1122940800,4,316,4.625

2014320,3,B0001MDPDQ,"I had this DVD and I gave it away. And there is a ""Dance With My Father"" DVD single that I have with Luther Vandross, a 2003 DVD single that has 3 single videos with Luther singing from his last 2 albums, and the albums are

""Luther Vandross"" (2001 album)
""Dance With My Father"" (2003 album)

And the 3 single videos with Luther singing from the ""Dance With My Father"" DVD single is

""Dance With My Father""
""Take You Out""
""Can Heaven Wait""

That's a DVD single I bought here on Amazon to replace this DVD with Luther's videos, and I have another DVD with it that was converted from ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" (1991 vhs), a video tape that I also have and that's converted on a DVD with all of Luther's videos from 1981, and a video tape that shows interviews with Luther talking, along with his videos. The DVD that I have that (1991 vhs) converted on, I would watch it, along with the 3 single videos from the ""Dance With My Father"" DVD single, and with Luther singing from his last 2 albums. And I have the ""Dance With My Father"" DVD single and ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" DVD stored in a zip-loc bag together like a double-disc collection of music videos with Luther singing and performing. So, it's like I made up my own DVD collection with Luther's videos just like this one.

I remember back in 2004 when this DVD came out, and I noticed the videos from ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" (1991 vhs), and some newer videos with Luther singing from 1993 to 1997. So, this is a DVD I can do without watching and just stick with watching the ""Dance With My Father"" DVD single, and ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" DVD that's converted from the (1991 vhs). And I can also do without watching Luther sing in the newer videos from 1993 to 1997 on this DVD. The videos with Luther singing from the ""Dance With My Father"" DVD single, and from ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" (1991 vhs) are pretty much just the videos I like to see with him singing, but I'm a big Luther Vandross fan though.

The videos with Luther singing from 1993 to 1997 on this DVD is

""Little Miracles Happen Everyday""

""Always And Forever""

""Endless Love""
 (Duet with Mariah Carey)

""Love The One You're With""

""Your Secret Love""

 ""I Can Make It Better""

So, instead of watching these newer videos with Luther singing from this DVD, I would play the albums and where these videos are from. And the albums where these newer videos with Luther singing are from is

""Never Let Me Go"" (1993 album)
""Songs"" (1994 album)
""Your Secret Love"" (1996 album)

These are 3 albums by Luther Vandross, and that's where these 6 videos are from. And I would play them instead of watching the videos. I woud also play them, along with Luther's 1991 album, ""Power Of Love."" And there's a 1998 album that Luther came out with after these first set of his previous albums, and that album is

 ""l know"" (1998 album)

There are no videos with Luther singing from that album on this DVD. And that album was Luther's one and only album with Virgin Records, and it's a good album. And l would play that 1998 album, ""l Know,"" along with listening to Luther's previous albums from 1981, along with watching him sing and perform in videos just from ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" (1991 vhs) that l have converted on a single DVD.

And l don't like the look that Luther had in the 2 videos with him singing live at Royal Albert Hall, including the video with him singing a duet with Mariah Carey, and the Luther Vandross from that era is not what I want to see or know as an artist. And the video with Luther singing ""Love The One You're With"" is another video from that very same era, and it's another video that I don't like with the look that Luther had. But, l do like the songs with just hearing Luther sing them, including ""Endless Love"" (duet with Mariah Carey). I do like the look that Luther had in all the other videos, but I would still do without watching them. As my favorite singer, I like to see Luther look well_dressed whenever I see him sing and perform in a music video.

The only live performance that l like to see with Luther singing in concert is the one with him singing from the ""Live at Wembley"" (1989 vhs), and that's another video tape with Luther Vandross that I have converted on a DVD. That was a video tape that came out 2 years before ""The Best Of Luther Vandross"" (1991 vhs). And sometimes I would watch one by one of those on DVD with Luther performing.",1409011200,,4425,4.364190012180268

The collection of songs transversed from his solo hit ""Never Too Much"" to the concerts at Carnegie Hall. Breathtaking, pure Luther, classy and sassy.  The interviews were precious, and the ""House Is Not A Home"" live performance brought us all to tears.

I brought another copy of this DVD to give to my cousin who enjoyed the DVD so much that I want her and her husband to be able to enjoy Luther's legacy anytime they desire.",1153785600,9,676,4.524590163934426
