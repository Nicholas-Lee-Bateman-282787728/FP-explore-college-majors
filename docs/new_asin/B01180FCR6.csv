7329730,4,B01180FCR6,"We were looking for an interesting film set in a different culture, so had little idea what to expect beyond distinguished direction by an Iranian.

The story starts as an outing of friends, who leave Teheran to go to a popular resort area by the sea.  A woman has invited a stranger, Elly, who is the teacher of her child.  The idea, we learn, is to set her up with a handsome friend of hers, recently divorced.  It is kind of awkward, but Elly seems nice enough and the two intended seem to hit if off.

Then something unexpected happens and everyone is thrown into a chaos of hopes, expectations and neurotic anxieties.  The friends start arguing, they have little idea what to do yet are concerned about the feelings of others, many of whom they do not even know.  This leads to a web of lies that exposes the real relationships that are there, with devastating consequences.  Because it is an alien society, at first it seems funny, with a complexity like an Alan Aykbourn comedy of misplaced assumptions, but it quickly emerges as the darkest portrait imaginable.  Once the action began, I was riveted and curious to understand what motivated everyone and how it would end.

Warmly recommended.  I can't say we will want to watch this often, but it is a good addition to a quality dvd collection.  Western audiences may find it somewhat contrived, but the intent is serious realism.",1444953600,11,1388,4.64344262295082

7329733,5,B01180FCR6,"This film is an absolute masterpiece and it's a joy to be able to see in HD.
Everyone who has seen ""A separation"" will greatly enjoy this film that won Asghar Farhadi the Silver bear in Berlin for best director back in 2009.
The Blu-Ray is region free (it plays on my region 2 player).",1443139200,6,285,4.2
7329734,1,B01180FCR6,"I was very disappointed in this movie. While marketed as a suspenseful thriller, it's about as thrilling as watching paint dry. In the end I was left with more questions than answers. Don't waste your time with this one.",1442707200,2,220,4.666666666666667
7329735,3,B01180FCR6,"First of all, it's too long and could have been tighter and more focused if 1.5 hours instead of two.  Several inconsistencies.  I lean on the side of giving this two stars, but the effort was notable.  Some things just didn't make sense in the plot.  Acting was okay.  I really expected a big reveal or plot twist.  Felt like I wasted two hours waiting for what turned out to be a flat ending.",1442620800,5,394,4.256756756756757
8723762,5,B01180FCR6,"This is the second best Farhadi's movie in my mind. Acting, story, filming, ... everything is honed to perfection by this talented director/writer. Highlg recomended.",1514851200,,166,5.68
8723763,5,B01180FCR6,"Been too long since I first looked at this one. This one shows how little we know about Middle-Eastern living. It's way beyond the nightly newsreels and reports which shed a grim and fearful spotlight. Plus, with Elly's disappearance and the friends' frantic reactions, we the audience, too, recognize that we think we know ourselves and each other until we don't. And the fairy tale lives we boast about during conversations are none but ideas. And what law says that truth reigns as such any less in Iran than it does in the States?",1514246400,2,534,4.691489361702128

8723767,3,B01180FCR6,The acting is superb. The script is ultimately weaker than it should be. I had been lead to believe by the promos that it would have a blockbuster twist -- but no.,1457308800,,163,4.125
8723768,1,B01180FCR6,I dislike subtitle films. The quick verbiage was necessarily reflected in the text.  I was so consumed by reading fast that I missed much of the action and acting;.  It would have been better to read or listen to an Audible version of a book. I would have gotten more out of it.  I gave up after less than ten minutes of this film.  What a waste.,1456963200,2,346,4.119402985074627

8723770,4,B01180FCR6,"After the relative success of Asghar Farhadis films, The Past (2011) and Oscar winning (foreign language film) A Separation (2013), distributors dug deeper into the past to find this excellent film from 2009.  Released in the U. S. in 2015, Farhadi tells the story of 3 couples (and 3 kiddies) and 2 singles headed for a vacation at a Caspian Sea resort.

One of the singles, Ahmad (Shahab Hosseini) is recently divorced from a German woman.  Living in Germany he is returning to Tehran.  The single woman, Elly (Taraneh Alidoosti) is Sepidehs (Golshifteh Farahani) daughters teacher.  Sepideh is clearly playing matchmaker, to the consternation of some in the group.  Elly tells Sepideh that she can only stay one night as her mother has a recent heart condition and must return to Tehran.  Sepideh insists that she stay, going so far as to hide her luggage and cell phone.

The 3 children are playing on the beach with some confusion as to who is watching them.  One of the mothers asks Elly to keep an eye on them while she goes inside.  But it isn't clear who and how many she is to watch.  The men are busy playing volleyball when one of the children tells them that the older boy (about 6) is in the water.  Everyone rushes to the ocean and the drowning boy is ultimately saved.  But what about Elly?  Where is she?  Did she go after the boy and drown herself or did she just leave on foot?  More panic ensues and the mystery is afoot.

Admittedly I struggle at times with cultural differences with foreign language films.  A certain amount of misogyny is prevalent in films set in countries predominantly Muslim.  Iran, in many ways seems to be more progressive.  Hey, at least the women can drive!  As Farhadi, who also wrote the script, moves the story along questions will arise as to why certain characters act the way they do.  The cast is exemplary with Ms. Farahani a stand out.

The Blu ray disc looks and sound excellent.  The transfer comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The dilapidated condition of the villa can be seen in great detail.  Contrast is excellent.  Colors come if varying shades of grey and blue for the most part.  The audio offers a DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track which conveys the dialog clearly, although most of us will need the English subtitles which is the only option for the original Farsi.  If you liked Farhadis more recent films, this will fit right in.  Recommended.",1447372800,11,2439,4.617715617715618
8723771,5,B01180FCR6,"This is one more wonderful Iranian film which plays in an elegant and fascinating way with the set of ethics of modern Iranian people which is VERY different from what we Westerners have in our societies. The centerpiece of the film is the grave consequences that matters of honor have for an engaged young woman who decides to accept an invitation to spend a day with some friends, among whom is also a single man interested in her. A horrible accident will bring to surface all the moral restrictions that there are in the core of the Iranian culture. Excellent film!",1445126400,11,569,4.643564356435643
