8534253,1,B0091JJ282,"Not sure when tor where this concert was recorded. Maybe Ireland in 1980's?
I love Willie but in this concert he was playing an emerald green electric guitar and singing  songs like Fraulein and Be My Valentine.  Picture quality is awful, especially the color.  I was disappointed and won't play it again.",1521763200,,305,4.826923076923077

Quality was poor.  We love Willie and recently saw him in concert but
this DVD doesn't do him justice.",1368316800,2,173,4.242424242424242

8534258,1,B0091JJ282,This was as if an amateur recorded it from a television with rabbit ears.  Absolutely inferior quality.  Very disappointed in this transaction.  Would gladly return it for credit.,1363910400,,179,5.321428571428571
8534259,3,B0091JJ282,"This concert is not from '02. MISLEADING DESCRIPTION.  The concert is from '91 and is called the great outlaw valentine concert.  i bought it and got something i already had.  the concert is ok.  it's very subdued and mellow.  kimmie rhodes is featured.  it rates a b-.  not that good.  and certainly this keeps being put out under many different names over and over again.  the 2002 date fooled me.  know you know :)-
ps, no liner notes indeed.  zip.",1361923200,2,451,4.5125
8534260,3,B0091JJ282,"It has no information on the outside or inside the box, to show where it was recorded, when, or even who some of the other people in the band and concert were; Nothing at all, just his photo and name on the front cover, and a list of the songs on the back. even tho some of the songs were duets  and one was by someone else entirely, there is no info to explain; it is almost like a bootleg DVD, or whoever produced it were ashamed of it; no credits, nothing!! The picture and sound were good, but it was a guessing game otherwise;",1361404800,2,531,4.057142857142857
