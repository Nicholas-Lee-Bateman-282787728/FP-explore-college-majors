4067776,5,B0034JIP4W,"This is a great DVD!  I purchased it for my 4-year-old daughter who is a huge fan of all things Busytown, and both she and her 5-year-old sister are crazy about it!  My kids love the Richard Scarry books (as a kid, I did too) and this DVD is a collection of the kinds of fun, wholesome stories and bright, colorful characters you expect from Richard Scarry.  This DVD has six mystery episodes, each about 11 minutes long, that encourage kids to think and to problem-solve.  The mysteries on this disc are as follows:

1. The Mystery Wheel
2. Busytown Blue-Bottoms
3. The Sticky Stuff Mystery
4. Up, Up and Away
5. Where's Junior?
6. There Might Be Giants

Each mystery features characters kids know and love, like Huckle Cat, Hilda Hippo, Lowly Worm and Goldbug.  Highly recommended!",1302048000,25,783,4.630434782608695

8388381,5,B0034JIP4W,"I remember Richard Scarry fondly from my youth, so I first bought a Busytown DVD for my kids, which had a ""Busytown Mysteries"" episode included.  I like the Mysteries a lot better than the regular Busytown cartoons, because they demonstrate using reasoning and deduction to solve the mysteries.
My 6 y.o. daughter wanted me to add ""I love it I love it I love it I love it."" :o)  Keeps her 2 y.o. brother's attention as well.  Makes me feel better about the screen time when there is learning involved.",1369699200,,501,4.544444444444444
