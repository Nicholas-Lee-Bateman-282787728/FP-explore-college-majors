8519157,1,B0000705RB,"Manic Street Preachers is my favorite band. I love these videos, or what I can find on YouTube, so I was so waiting for to watch them  on my big screen TV. I was very disappointed that my DVD player gave me a region code error. Both my computer and laptop give me the same errors. I bought this from one of the other sellers listed for this product, but Amazon should have info about the Region Code. Especially since the seller is American and so is the customer, why on Earth would the DVD have a foreign region code. Then again, there is nothing on the DVD covers or inserts mentioning a foreign region code.",1355097600,2,611,4.267241379310345
