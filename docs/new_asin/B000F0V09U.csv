8116373,3,B000F0V09U,"Dead Girl Walking (Kaiki! Shinin shjo): 6 out of 10: If you watched the recently released Japanese horror anthology movie Rampo Noir this film might seem like a missing fifth chapter (And it certainly would have made a better fit that that Yoko Ono Mars short.)

Dead Girl Walking takes a singular premise (girl has heart attack and dies, yet her body refuse to de-animate to the confusion and distress of the girl and her family.) and runs with it. The film consists of this Japanese school girl slowly decomposing as her parents and others attempt to put her to rest. It is a Japanese television production from the Theater of Horror, but unlike other segments from this series it has decent gore effects and good direction.

The only real problem with Dead Girl Walking is as a stand alone project is there really isn't much here. Once the girl starts decomposing the story arc is pretty well set. While the film is both creative (Sometimes reaching an avant-garde level of consciousness in its visuals) and deceptively humorous (the family's attempts to dispose of the girl are in reality quite funny) its conclusion is never really in doubt. In addition the characters themselves seem almost cartoonish, (which in its own way adds to the surrealistic effect of the proceedings.)

Dead Girl Walking is a decent ride for both fans of high art and gore hounds alike and is an above average television short.",1258243200,,1409,4.790123456790123
