8124088,4,B000FKP1UE,"... and the men behind the legend. Biography's (sometimes tongue in cheek) look at Lee Falk's legendary and enduring comic book creation, The Phantom, crosses generations and interpretations. Biography hits the highlights of the Phantom's life and times, the major events of his life, including the eventual marriage to his sweetheart of some 3 decades, Diana Palmer.

I purchased this for background on a scholarly work I was writing on The Phantom, and it proved a valuable, and especially entertaining look at the life and times of The Phantom.",1397952000,,547,5.146067415730337
8124089,3,B000FKP1UE,"This program spends most of its time providing an overview of the mythology and storyline of the comic strips. There's very little behind the scenes insight into the franchise(only highlight is Falk explaining why he made The Phantom's eyes all white when he's wearing his mask).

This DVD is expensive for only 45 minutes. Overall not worth it unless you're completely new to the franchise and want a primer.",1358899200,,409,4.927536231884058
8124090,5,B000FKP1UE,"The Phantom was one of the first superheroes to exist (created in 1936) and has had a major influence on people, the world over. In some Slavic countries he is a national hero even. This DVD documentary presents the history of this character in conjunction with the 1996 Billy Zane film. Great for fans of The Phantom.

Also, if you want to get some modern Phantom stories, read anything by MOONSTONE books!",1333670400,,407,4.652777777777778
