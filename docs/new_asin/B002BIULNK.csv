3894626,5,B002BIULNK,Private motivations and situations abound but the kind sense of community prevails in this funny presentation of UK village life.,1254960000,,129,5.5
3894627,4,B002BIULNK,"Season one was a real winner, this season not so much. Too much pandering to the unappreciative daughter and would have liked to have seen more of the individual women's lives, all in all too great a cast to not give a good review. I Did miss Joann Lumley in the second season. It is a shame when the cast changes in these and I hope to see them all return for season 3. Anxious to see that released soon.",1254614400,,405,4.075
3894628,5,B002BIULNK,"I just finished watching the 6 episode DVD of Clatterford Seaon 2. Overall, I thought that is was great. I enjoyed the return of many of the main characters. I thought that the stories flowed, naturally, from the characters and premises established in the first season. There was some minor redundancy, e.g. Caroline and Suzie pondering each one's understanding of the meaning of certain words. But, no matter. The final episode of this series is as sweet, funny, and poignant as any of the Season 1 episodes. I read, somewhere, that there were some additional special episodes made after this Season 2. I look forward to seeing them. More, more, more!",1253318400,,652,4.882882882882883
3894629,4,B002BIULNK,"Clatterford is like a cup of hot chocolate and a blanket on a wintry day. It's warm and inviting, and celebrates a slower pace of life that I personally long for. That being said, Season Two is a slight step below the first one. I really only have two chief complaints with this season: The first is the absence of Joanna Lumley's character, who makes an appearance in the first episode and is gone from the rest. She was a lot of fun to watch and was sorely missed.
The second, and more important complaint is the out of character plot line for Sal. All of last season, Sal was trying to get her thirty-something daughter Tash to grow up and take responsibility of her life. At the end of last season, Tash had hooked up with a childhood friend who was a good, responsible man who loved her and her son. You'd think Sal would be thrilled. However, for some unknown and out of left field reason, this season Sal instead tried to push Tash and SPIKE together. And succeeded. Now Spike is a likable drug-addicted loser (!), and actually not too bad a match for Tash, personality wise, but the whole thing came across as contrived. Why would Sal want her daughter to ditch her oh so dependable boyfriend for someone who has less going for him than Tash? It simply doesn't make sense and therefore takes us out of the show.
That being said, the show is still very entertaining and the cast is a joy to watch, and I can't wait for Season Three, which just finished airing in the U.K. As I ask is for a little more consistency in charactization.",1252972800,6,1539,4.384615384615385
3894630,4,B002BIULNK,"i was pleasantly surprised to find that i enjoyed this season of clatterford as much, if not more, than season 1. there's a definite change in tone, and there are many more touchy/feely moments, although fortunately it's still leavened by sharp observations of the foibles and eccentricities of all the characters. we see many more sides to all the characters, and although apparently some people found some characters' behaviors to be unbelievable, i thought everything was in character, although with better pacing it would've been more convincing. part of the problem with the pacing is that each season is only six 1/2-hour episodes so there's not much time for the storylines to linger much. but it's amazing that they manage to pack in so much in so little time. i was also surprised that the plot progresses so much and there are some big changes which really give the sense of clatterford being a real place. definitely recommended. i'm really looking forward to season 3 and hope it comes out sooner than later!",1252800000,,1020,4.901734104046243
3894631,3,B002BIULNK,"I wrote a review rhapsodizing over season 1 of Clatterford and couldn't say enough good things. We were on the list to get season 2 the second it became available on Amazon U.S. Alas, we are sadly disappointed. We should have been alerted when we saw a second name on the writing credit. However, we figured Jennifer Saunders would have remained on top of things and kept the characters and plots congruent, as they had been in season 1. The stories flowed so naturally from the characters that we were able to sit back and simply bask. However, season 2 is not in the same category - it is still better than most television, no matter what side of the Atlantic it's being produced, hence the 3 stars - but it certainly is not a 5 star series any more.

I'm going to confess here that a big piece of our disappointment was a totally unbelievable glitch in the behavior of one of the main characters, Sal. Sal's daughter, 36 years old and mother of a young child, is unable to take care of herself, can't make a decent decision, has to live with her mother because she won't/can't find work, and is neglectful of her son. This is not pretty, but it is believable - as is the way Sal alternates between being frustrated beyond reason, and co-dependent to a fault. This rang true to us, as we have a similar situation in our own family - and we identified mightily with all of it- the frustrations, the co-dependency, the futile attempts to expect and demand adult behavior from someone who simply isn't capable of it - and continuing to love and hope despite all evidence to the contrary. It was the first time we'd seen this situation portrayed with sensitivity, honesty, and accuracy in any medium and we were mightily impressed. In Season 1 that is.

Then comes season 2 - wherein Sal, portrayed as an intelligent, experienced woman, who, although co-dependent, is not blind to her daughter's flaws -  encourages her to hook up with a man who is in worse mental health than the daughter, addicted to drugs, and even less responsible. Are we to believe that Sal lost enough IQ points in a year to take on a life time of supporting 3 people, rather than passing along the two she's already in bondage to? There is a solid and responsible man who wants to take care of them - are we to believe Sal would actively try to disrupt this happy state of affairs? I don't think so. It is especially annoying because this idiotic plot theme takes up a good bit of the season. Look around you - feckless, aimless, helpless people marry stable people who will take care of them. And then there's changing Tip from a funny, witty, kind, hard working woman who has a difficult life with a man she loves and who loves her - and the fortitude, wisdom, and humor to keep on with it - into a bitter, unhappy, whiner. A conflict with a lot of inappropriate verbal sniping between two other characters - Eileen and Katie is unlikely, unpleasant, and irritating to watch. Given the character development of these two women, it simply wouldn't be. And we are smart enough to know that.

Conflict for conflict's sake is just plain painful (as well as boring and annoying) to watch. This plot technique only causes a person to click the clicker and pop in a different DVD - or go read a well written book. Season 1 of Clatterford we watched virtually in one sitting, it was so compelling. Season 2 we turned off before the disk was done. We will probably finish watching it some time - but we felt no need to lose sleep over it. My only regret about writing this review is that I plan to resell it and have to hope no one reads it before buying!

To be honest, there is some constancy as well, which makes it worth a viewing. Is it that there was only one good season in this setting, with these characters? Certainly I expected there was more gold to be found in Clatterford. Or is it that the firm and talented hand that guided the first season is doing something else, and a television hack writer has taken charge? The acting remains topnotch, it's the writing that has fallen off. We've seen a few television series where that has happened - the originator has said all he/she has to say and moves on, leaving the plotting to a lesser talent. After a season or two of implausible plots and incongruent characterizations, the series simply fades away. What a shame to have this happen to Clatterford.

I am giving a limited recommendation: you will find some of it less than plausible and therefore not nearly as entertaining as season 1; but there is still enough remaining of the superb characters and their doings to be worth a watching. I'm not so sure I'm glad we bought it, however. I would love there to be a season 3, back to the quality of the first season.",1252108800,28,4746,4.461981566820277
3894632,5,B002BIULNK,"I've been waiting impatiently for the second series of this delightful British show (titled Jam and Jerusalem there) to be available on this side of the pond. Although it still hasn't aired here on BBC America, I did catch these episodes in 9-minute chunks on YouTube (certainly not the best way to catch a TV show, but grateful for the access anyway). It's a sweet, funny, and very poignant character study of the quirky women of Clatterford, a small fictional village in Devon. If you've not seen series 1, don't think you're getting another AbFab from the brilliant Jennifer Saunders. This is a very different show. Like series one, it showcases the gentler side of English village life that is sadly passing away.",1244764800,45,717,4.837398373983739
3894633,5,B002BIULNK,Crazy funny and real. This is my go to when I am blue set.,1416355200,,58,3.2142857142857144

3894636,5,B002BIULNK,What a great series! I wish there was more to this series. It makes me laugh and cry and everything in between. About a small town in England with a ladies' society and how the whole town operates around it. There's the pub and the laughter and the love. Too funny and just great. Written by Jennifer Saunders who also plays the Lady in it. She wrote Ab Fab. You will love it!,1402963200,,376,4.164383561643835
3894637,5,B002BIULNK,i have this and bought another for a gift.  I know this will be a hit as she loves all the charactors,1400630400,,101,3.590909090909091
3894638,5,B002BIULNK,"I live in the US and never saw this show until recently (it is called Jam & Jerusalem in the UK) it is so absolutely funny. Its my new favorite and I watch a lot of Brit TV. It features Dawn French, Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley (who you won't recognize at first) and Sue Johnston. Very interesting characters, absolutely hysterical. If you liked Ab Fab you'll love this.",1390694400,,374,4.514705882352941
3894639,5,B002BIULNK,The dvd was in excellent condition and the shipping was right on schedule. I watched a marathon Clatterford during holiday breaks from job; sipping chai teas. You know it is the little things.,1388966400,,192,4.848484848484849
3894640,5,B002BIULNK,I really enjoyed this show. I had never seen it so I took a chance because of the great actors. I was not disappointed!,1388707200,,119,4.0
3894641,5,B002BIULNK,"Clatterford is one of my favorite British shows. I was really able to get into the characters. Season Two goes more deeply into all their lives, and ends with the wedding of Sal's daughter. Lovely!",1388620800,,197,4.6571428571428575
3894642,5,B002BIULNK,"Love this series, it is wildly funny. While watching it, you forget the worries of the world. Can't wait to see the next episode.",1381190400,,129,4.416666666666667
3894653,5,B002BIULNK,You will come to love each and every quirky resident of Clatterford.  Once again the subtle comic genious of Jennifer Saunders shines in this lovely tale of a village and its inhabitants.  Highly recommend and good transaction with seller.,1371168000,,239,5.102564102564102
3894654,5,B002BIULNK,"Anything penned by Jennifer Saunders is fantastic.  This series is a bit offbeat, even for her.  It is a very engaging group of actors and they play their parts to the hilt.  A very, very good series.",1369008000,,200,4.351351351351352
3894655,5,B002BIULNK,"I am a big fan of Absolutely Fabulous (which stars Jennifer Saunders) and also love the French & Saunders comedy team starring Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders. These two women are absolutely fabulous-ly hilarious (pun intended)! I can't think of any female comedy dou that make me laugh as hard as these two do! On Clatterford, they are both represented but instead of starring roles, they are more there for support. They are funny, Saunders is more dead-pan in her reactions while French, in her portrayal of a woman with a split personality, gets to go 'out there' with her comedic antics, but not too far. This series is a more laid-back one, there are no prat-falls, no mugging for the camera, the comedy comes from different everyday situations. The rest of the cast is excellant. This series is more on the dramatic side with quiet humor thrown in here and there. If you like the French/Saunders team, then this show is a must for you!",1365033600,,944,4.692771084337349
3894656,5,B002BIULNK,Clatterford or (Jam and Jersusalem) is one of my favorite British television comedies of all time. The show is absolutely amazing and I laughed soooo much. I was so sad once it came to an end and I had seen all the episodes. You really grow attached to all of the characters. This show is a must have for any fan of British Comedy,1362268800,,330,4.171875
3894657,5,B002BIULNK,"This is great show and the cast is wonderful, full of names you'd know from shows produced either by Jennifer Saunders and or Dawn French.
Women this is a treat!",1361750400,,161,4.4
3894658,5,B002BIULNK,Just loved this - Wish they had done more seasons.  Would be watching over and over.  Would definately recommend for any Dawn French or Jennifer Saunders fans.,1357084800,,159,4.851851851851852
3894659,5,B002BIULNK,"Don't pass this by -- it's enchanting, well-written comedy that you won't be able to stop watching. Dawn French is adorable in this.",1351900800,,132,4.782608695652174
3894660,5,B002BIULNK,"Tash's wedding is my favorite tv wedding - perhaps my favorite on screen wedding - ever!  It's the most fun (and visually interesting) and, for me (and obviously not just for me) truest treatment of the subject.  It's funny and such a relief to have a new (for screen) perspective about the whole wedding process (""madness!"" - whether you agree or not, I can't imagine you don't find the dress shopping scene funny) (or can I?)
Not even addressing the issue of believability in this kind of tv show, I'm taking the time to write here because I'm so surprised by your comments about the suitability of Spike for Tash - that as a mother, Sal should prefer that her daughter marry someone that made her feel dull, and stifled and most of all, would thrust her into a life that felt artificial. She even changed her hair, she looked terrible and bland and faded. Devoid of life, joy, style - it was pathetic. Why would would you prefer Sal, any mother, to stifle her daughter's true nature, to sentence her to life that would make her unhappy, in which she would be dampened rather than bloom? Recreational drug use may have been written into Spike's character, but it happens in real life that stifling unhappy partnerships can and do lead to alcoholism and drug use, and it's hardly a nurturing for any child of such a partnership (to say the least).  Would you prefer your daughter be addicted to prescription drugs, to a life of frustration, just to conform, to look good to the people who wouldn't accept anything unconventional? How horrible. Why would you want so much sameness, let alone for someone who clearly has a different nature, personality and point of view, who's vision is different, and brilliant in its own way - why would you sacrifice a productive life in happiness just to conform to a half life, the destructive consequences of an unhappy life for sake of meaningless convention?  One of the reasons I thought these episodes worked so well is that even in fleeting vignettes, the characters never seemed false to the character that had been rendered through the series - the character and characters I'd come to love. Those of you who are surprised about Tash and Spike's wedding must have been watching, and loving, a totally different series than I.",1330041600,,2271,4.698492462311558
3894661,5,B002BIULNK,"This is a terrific series-well acted, well writen-always a joy to see these people work-and yet it still amazes me how inconsistant the sound recordings are from BBC-the sound has always been inconsistant with Britcoms.  WHy is that?",1329782400,,233,5.131578947368421
3894662,5,B002BIULNK,"Wow, this is a fantastic britcom! Jennifer has hit the nail on the head with this one. It is so believable and the camera works is fantastic. It really brings you in to the group of women in this village and makes you feel you are right there with them.  You'll be laughing and crying right along side this wonderful well written show. Also what a wonderful cast, some of my favorite British Actresses.
Too bad it has been dropped from the BBC and three seasons is all we are going to get.",1300579200,,489,4.258064516129032
3894663,5,B002BIULNK,"If you love French and Saunders like I do, this is the series for you.  Joanna Lumley is also a favorite of mine , though she's not in the
series often or for very long, she is a great addition to the cast.  Very Funny !",1288828800,,220,3.760869565217391
3894664,5,B002BIULNK,"I read about this series a while back in the newspaper and had to wait for it to come out on DVD to see it. It was worth the wait. The second season (here)is now out on DVD.

It is about people living in a small town somewhere in England - mostly the women in the church lady group. There are many characters in the show - including Dawn French as a woman with multiple personalities who works in a cheese factory. The show is comic, but dramatic at times as well.

I think that some of the people in the show are not actors but are from the town where the show is shot. There are very amusing too.

It is a little hard to explain the show beyond this, but it is very good. If you like British TV, give it a try. I think season three will be available soon too.",1279497600,,761,3.9285714285714284
3894665,5,B002BIULNK,"A perfect follow up to season one.  Anyone who likes British Comedy will love this.  The characters are clearly developed, the writing is sharp and Clatterford is a delightful place to spend some time.  I found myself totally engrossed in their lives and enjoying every minute.",1275868800,,277,4.978260869565218
3894666,2,B002BIULNK,"What a disapointment, I LOVED season one, All the women of the village and the funny way they live, then came season two, I waited a long time for it to come out on DVD. Like I said what a disapointment. I bought it on Amazon.com  I have watched it once and probably will not watch it again",1267920000,3,290,4.0
3894667,5,B002BIULNK,"I believe this show is known as ""Jam & Jerusalem"" in UK and Australia.  You have to watch it if you imagine Joanna Lumley as always being cool and ladylike.  In this series she's a strange village character, riding around on her bike, dreadful clothes and problems with her false teeth.  Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French feature strongly.  About women running town activities.",1265587200,,377,4.936507936507937
3894668,5,B002BIULNK,"Wonderful 2nd season, looking forward to 3rd season DVD but sad that season 4th has been canceled.",1262995200,,98,4.823529411764706
3894669,4,B002BIULNK,"Unlike another reviewer I actually found myself preferring Season Two to Season One. I was really excited when I heard about the series as I cackle at Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French sense of humour. But when I did watch Clatterford S. 1 I found it almost unwatchable - and in fact did not finish watching more than one or two eps. It seemed silly, scattered and too twee. It seemed to mockingly epitomize all the cliches of village life.

Fast forward, I spy Season Two and take another shot at watching the village eccentrics and was very pleasantly surprised. It seemed much more coherent and focused. Did Sal take an abrupt turn endorsing Spike as her daughters paramour? Perhaps but while Sal is the lovable central character in this show, she has a strange affinity for the gnarlier aspects of medical practice and is not exactly rooted firmly herself. The acorn doesn't fall far from the tree here.

After enjoying S. Two I gave One another shot and found it more watchable. Yes Joanna Lumley had a bigger role in it but while it was fun for a few seconds to watch her laboriously cycle at knot -1 after a while it was just tiresome. One village idiot - love Dawn French as Rosie - is enough!

There are many gems tucked away amongst the jam. I think both series bear repeated viewing just to catch all of them!",1260316800,,1320,4.491666666666666

3894671,4,B002BIULNK,"Clatterford is very entertaining. If you liked ""Calendar Girls,"" you will certainly love this cast of women! They are charming, corky, and, overall, fun to watch! Dawn French is a hit in this show. She is a mentally challenged individual, who actually may be more sane than people think. Her character brings some of the issues being confronted by the women to the surface, but in such an unexpected way. In the U.K., this show is entitled, ""Jam & Jerusalem."" I am not sure if they have aired the third season, but I can't wait for it to be released on DVD. This show also has some of the same characteristics of, ""The Vicar of Dibley,"" which was created by Richard Curtis (Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral...). Both shows deal with a set of characters that you get to know, who are endearing and fun to watch! Have fun watching ""Clatterford.""",1257897600,,853,4.5816993464052285
