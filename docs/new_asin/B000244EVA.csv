8323885,5,B000244EVA,"This show probably didn't sell well due to lack of reviews and the title name which has the word ""diaper"" in it. What a shame since it's one of the best comedies I've ever seen. people say comedies are either hit or miss, well this one is definitely a SMASH hit in my book. Watch it in original Japanese though since I personally found the voice a lot suitable and the fast paced dialogues more properly delivered that enhance the humor.

story begins with a young girl working for a toy company that designed a power suit which you can see in the cover art, yes it's the blue suit with a diaper of all things. There's a power suit competition going on and in order for her suit design to be selected as the superior one, this girl flies to earth in search of a suitable subject who's willing to wear it to combat intergalactic criminals, each having a unique personality i should add. well stuff happens and you laugh at the TV.

artwork and animation is surprisingly good, not AMAZING but more than enough for this kind of shows. my only gripe with this show is that towards the end it takes itself a tad too seriously for its own good, but the ending more than makes up for it. anyway since it's out of production now i suggest buying it while it's reasonably cheap and have a good time with it.",1238544000,4,1298,4.315573770491803
