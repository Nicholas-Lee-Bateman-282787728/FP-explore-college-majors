7934028,4,B000059PSO,A Canadian film with an engrosing story and fine cast. Different action type film with more human interest than most on-the-run films.,1284163200,,134,5.136363636363637
7934029,5,B000059PSO,"This understated little Canadian gem is full of surprises.  It stars Kevin Zegers as Simon, the 14 year old son of a small-time hoodlum.  They share a rather mystical and very loving bond.  They also plan to double-cross the father's partner in a bank heist and keep the proceeds for themselves.  Unbeknownst to Simon, the robbery goes badly awry.  He spends the next four days looking for his father.  Crystal (Lolita Davidovich) picks him up along the way in her yellow convertible.  She is being pursued by her husband, who wants his car back, and Simon by the wronged criminal who wants his money back.
The story is almost secondary to the film-making:  the exquisite photography, the fast-paced editing, the wonderful characters, and the exquisite Kevin Zegers.  His face could launch a thousand ships, and the depth of sadness in his character -- way beyond his years -- will break your heart.  His extraordinary presence makes this beautiful little film work.
Let us hope there is a DVD in the making. I was lucky and found a pre-viewed VHS copy and took a chance.  The high price will, unfortunately, keep many from enjoying this treasure.",1077580800,9,1147,4.8307692307692305
7934030,5,B000059PSO,"As a Canadian film obsessor, this has definately ranked into my top three. Beautifully editted, filmed, and acted, 4 Days catches emotions with a fishhook and then sells it home. It got terrible reviews in most guides, but that's because it's a think-movie. Endings don't always have to be happy - if you don't get it the first time, don't give up. Not at all about a murder-mystery, I recommend this to anyone who wants their inner feelings to finally have a voice. And the whole reicarnation thing adds the perfect touch.",1065657600,4,523,4.695652173913044
