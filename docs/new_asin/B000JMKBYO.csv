I would watch the episodes online but they'd end up disappearing a day later and I kinda realized by now that they're kinda not supposed to be there. I realize this series will never be licensed in the US and as a result not have subtitles or a dub but I still enjoy it knowing I understand at least half of whats going on :D Also another heads up to all, if you are from the US like myself this DVD will NOT play in your DVD player. I play it from my computer and connect the HDMI cord to the tv and watch that way (:

The picture I posted is the funny part in the opening where Ryotsu made the criminal buy him 4 ice cream pops !! ",1465257600,2,704,3.8482758620689657
