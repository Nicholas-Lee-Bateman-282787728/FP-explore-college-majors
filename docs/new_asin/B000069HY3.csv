7965734,4,B000069HY3,"This DVD features an enthusiastic and energetic live set by one of the pioneers in alt-country as they approach their prime, warts and all, although the warts are few.  The intro and outro are admittedly cheesy and dated and the intro in particular cuts into the first song ""Lights of Downtown.""  Perhaps surprisingly the sound is full and well-mixed, somewhat better than I expected for a live concert recorded in 1986.  The songs are a nice mix of crowd-pleasers and selected album tracks, although it lacks the seminal country-punk rave-up ""(Sweet) Mental Revenge"" by Mel Tillis.  The five songs performed by bandleader Sid Griffin solo acoustically in storyteller form in a recording studio are impressive, especially with his generous verbal annotation of each; I appreciated hearing Griffin's respect and affection for his Ryders bandmates.  As likely the only video recording of the Long Ryders in their heyday available, this is an invaluable document and provides a complement of sorts to the Ryders 2004 UK reunion tour recording ""State of Our Re-Union'.  Both avid Ryders fans and the casually curious should purchase a copy, new or used, before they are no longer widely available - I surmise this is already out of print and the Amazon Market Place vendors are clearing their warehouses and backrooms of old new stock.",1409702400,,1331,5.08256880733945
