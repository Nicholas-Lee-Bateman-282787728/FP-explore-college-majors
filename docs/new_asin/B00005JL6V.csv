1459393,5,B00005JL6V,"Sweeney Todd is a musical masterpiece.  From its ingenious use of motives to its dark story, Sondheim and Wheeler have crafted a brilliant show.  Every performance in this version is note-perfect, especially George Hearn as Sweeney.  Some people may find the idea of revenge, murder and cannibalism to be too dark for musical theater, but Sondheim tempers them with show-stoppingly funny musical sequences and some of the most gorgeous music ever written for the stage.  There is not a single misstep in this production.  Worth a look for any fan of musical theater.",1017273600,,566,5.043010752688172

1459494,5,B00005JL6V,"The story of the unexpected return of a convict barber Benjamin Barker alias Sweeney Todd (George Hearn) that is a cut above the average barber and his relationship to a talented meet pie baker Mrs. Nellie Lovett (Angela Lansbury.)

Lyrics by Stephen Sondheim; Book by Hugh Wheeler; Based on a version of ""Sweeney Todd"" by Christopher Bond.

The intrigued in this program made for TV is not as much the story line but how it is executed. There are some great Stephen Sondheim musical pieces and excellent actors such as Edmund Lyndeck who plays Judge Turpin, the judge that falsely convicted Benjamin Barker. You feel that you are in a live audience and find yourself shouting out don't do that to those intending to be well groomed.",1505865600,,733,4.7637795275590555

1459575,5,B00005JL6V,Best version of the Broadway Musical.,1489622400,,37,5.333333333333333
1459576,5,B00005JL6V,"The Sweeney Todd tale of a deranged homicidal barber has its roots in the 'Penny Dreadfuls' of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
The musical version was written by Stephen Sondheim in 1979, based on the 1973 play by Christopher Bond and is generally the only form of Sweeney's tale that is presented publicly.
This version is from 1982 and stars Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett and George Hearn as the titular barber himself.
The chemistry between the two lead characters is fantastic. Mrs. Lovett's charmingly casual way of thinking perfectly offsets Sweeney's grim and brooding presence, and with this cast the story carries all the humor it was meant to have. Don't mistake it, this is a dark comedy with some fantastic twists.
Somewhere between a musical and a modern opera, Sweeney Todd is practically a genre all to itself. The cast in this version is excellent, with the possible exception of Joanna (Betsy Joslyn) who's voice at times becomes over-shrill and often seems as though the acting portion of the role is a bit beyond her.
If you've never seen Sweeney, this is an excellent version to pick up, rather than the Tim Burton movie that sadly pushed the macabre and gore over keeping the charm and humor this version plays so well.
If you've only seen the movie, you should see this version to understand the depth and complexity the play truly has.",1488153600,,1367,4.772151898734177

1459724,5,B00005JL6V,"There is not much to say about this story. We all know it is a tale of miscarriage of justice, of sexual greed, of alienation and injustice, and of final revenge that turns sour. This is a typical Victorian story in the line of Jack the Ripper and so many other crimes of that type, and I should say multiple killers or serial killers one century before the FBI invented profiling.

This particular production is special since it is a Broadway production of the musical that Tim Burton brought to the silver screen many years later. This particular production was actually brought to TV a long time ago and it is this TV version that they remastered and brought to us in this format. The sound is perfect of course since in the 1980s FM sound also call hi-fi sound was already arrived. The pictures are good though from a TV standard, probably professional, probably Betamax. The remastering was only used to clean up the sound and probably too to densify the resolution. So we can consider we have the best possible rendering of this old production.

The interest is to have a stage production from Broadway and from a period when special effects were not yet the norm on the stage. The stage production was supposed to create emotion in the spectators and they mostly only had human means to do so. They only wrapped up the human means in a stage setting that could increase or decrease the realistic effect. They chose to break up that realistic effect with the systematic use of machinery visible to the audience. Constantly elements, some enormous, are moved on the stage, turned around more or less building up structures that are supposed to render the various locations and the various scenes. It is totally artificial and it works perfectly because of the other dimension which is used in the most genial way imaginable.

This other dimension is the use of actors, singers and dancers, in  one word stage performers. The music is good but we do not see the musicians. The singers are not opera singers but musical singers and they are good not so much because of their voices but because they use their voices as one element of their performing. That performing is physical and the voices are part of this physicalness. The voices, the physical performing on the stage (movements and other physical contact or absence of contact) and the phenomenal body language and facial expressions, it all is extremely effective to create emotion and density. The situations are deep and heavy because of this performing qualities. It is what has slightly been reduced in the most recent period by the use of special effects. In those old days special effects were hardly available and the actors had to work with their bodies, voices and faces to create those emotions. And that was a time that has unluckily mostly disappeared.

In this case we have a real masterpiece because everything is looking artificial and yet the emotions look extremely realistic. Thats a stage directing choice that was more or less the only solution at the time if the stage director wanted to produce an emotional and powerful show. This is a real success along that line.

1459900,5,B00005JL6V,I remember being 22 years old and 1/2 asleep on the couch. The TV was turned to NY Channel 13 - it was a Friday night - and I heard this stunning beautiful odd music and a baritone voice like melted chocolate.  This was my first exposure to Sondheim and to George Hearn.  It was the start of a great love affair still going strong after 30 years.  I too have seen every production - and was fortunate to see Mr. Hearn in the concert version as well as a production at Paper Mill Playhouse in NJ with Judy Kaye as Mrs. Lovett.  She was the best Mrs. Lovett - her pathos and yet amorality and obvious obsession with Sweeney were all there.  Mr. Hearn - take a bow.  I've seen them all.

We bought the DVD so that we could retire the Betamax copy we had for all these decades in an attempt to add to the longevity of the Sony SuperBetaMax player/recorder which is still functioning.

Beyond the stellar performance by Angela Lansbury, the role of Beadle Bamford as portrayed by Calvin Remsberg was superb and the harp in the pit orchestra played by Toni Robinson was poetic making the total magnificent.

Angela Lansbury gives a great performance as Mrs. Lovett; kooky, a bit of a twit yet intelligent. I have never heard of George Hearn. However, the man is an excellent Todd. He gets lost in the character so well. From melancholy to strangely happy to ""I don't want to meet this guy in the alley"" type. Sondheim's music is fun and some pieces are moving. ""Joanna"" is particularly moving when Anthony first sees her. Then when Sweeny sings of his daughter the lyrics can just about break your heart. My particular favorite song is by Sweeny, ""My Friends"", I believe it is called. This is when Mrs. Lovett shows him that she has kept the tools of his trade all these years he was gone.

1460324,5,B00005JL6V,"In 1979, I was taken to the Uris Theatre (now known as the Gershwin Theatre) in NYC to see an early preview of this Stephen Sondheim/Hugh Wheeler musical, and it was like I'd died and gone to heaven. I was already a fan of Sondheim and Wheeler--to this day, A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC is my all-time favorite B'way show--but even so, I wasn't prepared for the brilliance of the book, music, and lyrics of SWEENEY TODD, not to mention the performances. This DVD of a later National Tour performance captures a lot of what I loved in the theater, and I can watch it whenever I want.

Picture and sound are very good, and the cameras never intrude on the ""live"" performance. I only have one small beef and one big beef with this package--the replacement leading men (George Hearn and Cris Groenendaal) are not quite as good as Len Cariou and Victor Garber in the original cast. That's the small beef--the big beef is somebody named Betsy Joslyn, who is truly terrible in the rle of Joanna. Her strident, constantly sharp singing is a far cry from the original ingenue (Sarah Rice), and it nearly derails the show. But not completely: there's always Angela Lansbury's Mrs. Lovett to make everything right again. She is simply splendid in one of her finest performances.

If all you know of SWEENEY is the recent film version, you really should see this. The film was okay, but there is so much more to the score and story in the stage version. Just cover your ears when the girl arrives. Otherwise, highly recommended.",1361232000,3,1508,4.602230483271375

1460471,5,B00005JL6V,"Nothing can top seeing a Broadway musical live, and I do mean nothing.  Movies are my favorite outlet for entertainment, but for musicals such as this 1979 Stephen Sondheim gem Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street nothing comes close to the original stage production.  From the opening whistle and the first lyric of the ballad ""Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd"" I knew I was hooked on this production.  It is a one of a kind musical experience that has to be seen to be believed.

Many who are currently familiar with the tale of Sweeney Todd were introduced by Tim Burton's film starring Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.  The film was visually stunning, and had some good acting, but I don't think the film adaptation properly captured the tone of the play.  Burton's film was a brooding melodrama set in a gothic tribute to the Universal Horror movies, but missed a key point of the play: Humor.  This is not a melodrama.  In fact, the entire play has a joyous sense of black comedy, and tongue-in-cheek antics which was almost entirely lost in Burton's film (I think it officially left the picture once Sacha Boren Cohen makes his exit...).

Fortunately for all of us wanting a taste of the true Sweeney Todd, Showtime has provided us with a fantastic televised version of the 1982 touring cast starring the always magnificent Angela Lansbury in her 1979 Tony Award winning role of Mrs. Lovett.  Replacing Len Cariou as the titular Sweeney is George Hearn, whose performance which is nothing short of being a force of nature.  Aside from Lansbury, we also have Edmund Lyndeck (Judge Turpin) and Ken Jennings (Tobias Ragg) returning from the original 1979 production.

Angela Lansbury and George Hearn possess great chemistry as the crazed partners who turn murder victims into meat pies. These two are a perfect pair, and for me George Hearn could be even better than Cariou (of course, I don't have the benefit of being familiar with Cariou's stage presence when he played the role).  Hearn is powerful, his voice captures the fury and insanity of a man out for revenge and with nothing left to lose (or, so he thinks...).  From the fondness of My Friends, the steady rising, predatory rage of Pretty Women, to the full blown hurricane of fury and insanity that is Sweeney's Epiphany George Hearn's performance is an amazing mixture of subtlety and insanity .  Angela Lansbury, of course, is the perfect Lovett, the maker of the ""Worst pies in London"" while taking the hots for Sweeney, Lansbury's performance mixing overwhelming glee with pure insanity, and LOVING it bringing the right level of manic energy and humor to the duet with Heart ""A Little Priest.""

As far as the technical side of the production is concerned, the editing and camera work in this show is top notch, standing high above many of the other attempts I've seen to transfer to excitement of a play to the screen.  Close-ups are provided when it enhances the mood and never are intrusive, and for the most part they allow us to see the entire stage so that it feels like the viewer is a part of the action.  I don't think any other filmed stage production has ever made me feel as involved as this 1982 production of Sweeney Todd.

Sadly this DVD has no bonus features, but with how high-quality the program itself is (if you've seen many recorded shows you'll know many fail to capture the energy of the play) I can accept the complete lack of bonus material (and interview with Lansbury, Hearn, and/or Sondheim would have been nice).  If you want to be exposed to Sweeney Todd as it was original staged, or simply want to get a taste of Broadway from the comfort of your own home, I cannot recommend this DVD enough!  This is a fantastic introduction to Sondheim's black comedy and Broadway. Short of jumping in a time machine this is the closest one can get seeing this legendary cast, so give it a look.  Attend the tale.",1329350400,2,3918,4.672489082969432
1460472,5,B00005JL6V,"What can I tell?  Either you love this show or you don't.  If you are like me, you already knew that this was the version for you.  You have seen it somewhere before and know that it is time for you to own this precious ruby.  However, if you are not familiar with it, let me help you judge the menu.  It is a recording of the stage version of the show for television.  The lighting and costumes are not overly dark which makes this production easier on the eyes, as well as help the characters to hide their nature in normalcy. It does not attempt to be an overdone Dickens set but has fluidity from scene to scene, character to character.  Pieces that have been sliced away from the other are there so that you can attend the tale.  Plus there is not the overkill, which gives the business a lift.  The macabre humor will have you singing for and desiring Mrs. Lovett's meat pies although you are filled with horror of the ingredients.  As with a good melodrama, justice is fully served, but in a modern show, also twisted,  There is a moral to it, but ""What happened, well, that's the play, and he wouldn't want us to give it away. Not Sweeney, not Sweeney Todd. The Demon Barber of Fleet Street!""  Once you have seen it, you will eat up the references that I have peppered in this review.",1327881600,,1292,4.293388429752066
1460473,5,B00005JL6V,"Harold Prince's original Broadway production of Stephen Sondheim's ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" must be ranked as one of the greatest Broadway musicals ever. This DVD, recorded during a live production in 1982, is as close to experiencing that original production as future audiences will ever come. Angela Lansbury told Robert Osborne in a TCM interview that ""Sweeney Todd"" would be her legacy, because it was the only one of her great Broadway performances that was recorded for posterity. I wouldn't go that far--we have ""Gaslight,"" ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate,"" after all, not to mention how many hundreds of episodes of ""Murder, She Wrote""--but her performance as Mrs. Lovett is nothing short of magnificent, and this DVD preserves it magnificently.

The entire cast--with one possible exception--matches Lansbury. Two other cast members from the 1979 production also recreate their roles--Edmund Lyndeck (Judge Turpin) and Ken Jennings (Toby Ragg). It's too bad Len Cariou and Victor Garber couldn't recreate their roles as Sweeney Todd and Anthony Hope. But George Hearn is enthralling as Todd, with a splendid baritone voice, and Cris Groenendaal as Anthony has a tenor voice as pure and sweet as anyone could wish. I have a problem, however, with Sara Woods as Johanna, though it may be more a problem with the music she's given: Sondheim pitches Johanna's big number, ""Green Finch and Linnet Bird,"" so high that most of the time Woods is almost shrieking.

Still, when Lansbury and Hearn caper about the stage, brandishing razors and singing ""A Little Priest""--as brilliant as anything by Gilbert and Sullivan, but in a far darker vein of humor--you know that you are watching geniuses at work. Tim Burton's version of ""Sweeney Todd"" is superb if you want to see a movie adaptation of this musical. But if you want the musical itself--whole and undiluted, and sung as well as it could possibly be sung--this DVD is the one to buy.",1327708800,3,1991,5.067073170731708

1460476,4,B00005JL6V,"A brilliant production of what might be Stephen Sondheim's greatest work, with superb performances from Angela Landsbury and George Hearn as Mrs. Lovett and Sweeney Todd, make owning this particular DVD a worthwhile investment.  The criticism that some have made about the intrusiveness of the framing and cuts for television are valid but this is the problem with televising any stage production.  One either records the production from the house, respecting the fact that one is recording a piece of theatre in much the same way one might see it live; otherwise, probably for budgetary reasons, the play or musical is shot quickly by a television director, very much aware of the belief that the medium is best suited to close-ups or tighter shots that direct and limit the viewers attention to what he/she believes is important to tell the story.  This also reveals the artifice that is very much a part of theatre, as in this instance, with the roles of Anthony and Johanna, superbly portrayed by actors noticeably older than the characters are meant to be.
Nevertheless, if one is a fan of the musical and wants to get a sense of what the original stage production looked and sounded like, this is the only record available.

Sweeney Todd is one of the great masterpieces of musical theatre blurring the genres of the musical and opera. Those who find musicals shallow should enjoy this as it has a little more bite. Fans of opera should also relish this as in it complex musical structures it resembles an opera. Sweeney Todd is bursting with melody, rhythmic variety, clever lyrics, interesting characters, and is quite unlike just about every other musical theatre production in its macabre storyline.

1460686,4,B00005JL6V,"After seeing the Johnny Depp movie adaptation of Sweeny, I was intrigued about what the uncut stage show would be like.  I enjoyed the film, but many viewers complained about the missing songs and singing quality.  This version was very well reviewed so I decided to rent it to see what the fuss was about.  And, it was excellent.  For those who may not know, this is an actual stage show that was filmed live.  So, you can see the audience at times and the sets are limited.  The sound quality is very good, but not as high quality as in a film.  There is a touch of echo at times.  However, this is very minor considering the age of the production.  The costumes are great for a live performance; loud and flashy to reach the people in the back, though Mrs. Lovett is the only character who actually changes costumes noticeably.  The colors of this production have also stood the test of time.

I've been a fan of Angela Lansbury for years.  I loved her in many Disney movies, and found her singing very good in them.  So, I expected her to do well here and she did not disappoint.  She easily played the villain to great effect in ""Manchurian Candidate"" so I knew she was capable of the dark role.  After seeing Lansbury, I realize how inadequate Helena Bonham Carter was as Mrs. Lovett in the recent film version.  I finally got the nuance and macabre humor in all her songs - in particular ""A Little Priest.""  Lansbury plays the part with a loony aspect.  Mrs. Lovett isn't the brightest apple in the tree and her evil deeds are motivated more by selfish practicality rather than burning revenge as Sweeny is.  This worked beautifully for comic relief amidst the dark story.  She more than deserved her Tony Award.  I had never heard of George Hearn before seeing him in this DVD.  However, he was fantastic as Sweeney Todd.  His voice is deep and resounding, and came through quite clearly from the stage.  The necessarily heavy make-up (once again to reach the people in the cheap seats) made him appear even more twisted.  Every song he sang was chock-full of emotion and he was a demanding presence on stage.  These two were phenomenal in their leading roles.

My biggest gripe with the Depp film was the minor characters.  They weren't developed at all, and the two lovebirds were totally unremarkable.  Here, having the full playbook and more time, that is not the case.  Turpin, Joanna and the rest become viable participants in the events taking place and fill out the plot.  Their singing was all quite good. And I have to say that the film should have kept the Greek Chorus and the ""Ballad of Sweeney Todd.""  The song really filled out Sweeny's motivations and  tied the whole thing together.  This would have helped the film overcome the gaps that the missing songs (necessarily cut for time) made.  Overall, this was a wonderful production.  Though it can't compare to actually seeing it live, it was well worth watching.  I can only hope that the film spurs producers to bring the musical back to theatres.  I would be the first in line for tickets at the Kennedy Center!",1217548800,2,3089,4.569343065693431

1460690,5,B00005JL6V,"I saw Sweeney on Broadway in 1979 with the original cast, not once but twice.  I was in NY for a week and went to a mid-week matinee, but Lansbury was not in the show.  I bought Friday evening tickets just because the show was so spectacular and I wanted to see it again, but I could tell there was an element missing from this matinee show, a slight lack of energy, a ""run-through"" feel.  (The actress that understudied Angela was known at the time for some commercial work - always had a gingham apron on and was selling some baking product.)

Well, Angela was back on Friday, and I can tell you that that show was the singular most thrilling time I have ever had in the theater.  Len Cariou, Angela, and Victor Garber in the original roles were stellar, and the whole show was a different experience with Angela back.  Thrilling, scary, disturbing, and well, Sondheim!, what more can I say.  (I also Patti Lupone and Mandy Patinkin in Evita that week, so it was up against stiff competition!  Patti is the star of the concert version of Sweeney done a couple of years ago, but for me Angela is the only Mrs. Lovett.)

Ok, so this DVD version has Len Cariou replaced by George Hearn, which is for me a bummer because Len IS Sweeney Todd.  George does not disgrace the role however and is an incredible singer - I was so happy to see him win the Tony for La Cage.  And Victor is gone, but ably replaced by Cris Groenendaal, though a little more ""ingenue"" than to my taste.  BUT, if you haven't experienced the original stage production with that spine chilling factory whistle and the actors rising from the depths(!!!) to perform and the incredible central revolving stage, then you must see this touring version for MOST of all that.

1460754,3,B00005JL6V,"When I first saw this production, I was not prepared for the dark savagery behind the story.  The ""chorus"" was distracting, and I found absolutely no hummable tunes to carry me away.

Fast forward much longer than I care to mention, and I saw the 2007 Theatrical version with my daughter, and the ""power"" of Sweeney Todd rested firmly on a much more mature individual.

The tragedy of the story was almost too intense to bear, and the light hearted breaks, such as ""A Little Priest"" and ""By The Sea"" seem to save the audience from immediately walking into the Bake Oven on their own volition.

And then the ""twist"".  The one I had forgotten about.  It was just almost too much to bear.

With this in mind, I decided to re-watch this production with new eyes.  I now had an appreciation of the music, and therfore was prepared to be Wowed all over again.  After all, movie musicals can NEVER capture the magic of the stage.  Right????

Wrong.  I felt the additional light heartedness displayed by Lansbury and Hearn were just disturbingly out of place.  Johanna, was particularly disturbing to me in this production and almost cringe-worthy compared to the wistful perfection of the screen version.

And the mentally deficient Tobias orignally written does not compare to the street wise urchin that inhabits the movie.

In fact, after watching the movie, I was even more underwhelmed by this production than when I first watched it.

The only thing I can say that was really outstanding about this version, is that the vocals are much clearer so you can more easily understand the various ""puns"" thrown out during the musical numbers.  I also appreciated the additional scenes between Anthony and Johanna, which shows a true affection between the two.

But for emotional impact, the stage version still pales.  And Tobias' insane blathering at the end about making sure to grind them three times is anti climatic compared to the closing scene of the movie where we fade out on the two souls, forever embraced in death.

This is indeed a rare occasion where I nearly love everything about the movie better than the stage show.  And while the singing is more spot on in this version, the characterizations, I feel, in the film are much better.

For a musical lover, this is a fine production, and any ""techie"" will appreciate just how grandly this show was staged.  However, beyond that, for pure emotional impact, the movie blows this version away, hands down.",1205193600,6,2459,4.774881516587678

In ""Sweeney Todd,"" Sondheim is at his most melodious. Although it is hard to choose my favorite among songs such as ""No Place Like London,"" and ""Not While I'm Around,"" the third ensemble of ""Johanna,"" in which the hauntingly beautiful melody stands in sharp contrast to the ghastly action onstage, ranks high.

Almost all the voices are equal to Sondheim's brilliant score, which belongs in the pantheon of grand opera. The exception is the girl playing Johanna, whose shrill soprano voice is forced to such an extent that it goes sharp; thus one loses not only the thread of the melody, but also the lilting beauty of the ""Green Finch and Linnet Bird"" song. As one who loves the audio CD, in which soprano Sarah Rice floats effortlessly through the aria, I was severely disappointed.

Fortunately, the rest of the cast is splendid: especially the Beggar Woman, Anthony the Sailor, and the boy Toby (The DVD edition has more or less toned down the extent of Judge Turpin's perversions, which are blatant in  Edmund Lyndeck's incredible version of ""Johanna"" in the audio CD.). Unfortunately the DVD does not provide the cast list on or inside the box, so I shall have to go back to the end of the disc and see who's in it besides the stars.

Nevertheless, the stars are shining brightly in this dark comic opera over a London that seems more like Paris of the Grand Guignol, the horror spectacle which once sent shivers down the spines of Parisian theatre goers. Even though the horror of the plot is unlikely to thrill the jaded modern audience, the performance of George Hearn certainly will.",1202774400,8,1846,4.741433021806854

Also, there is some additional music/singing that is in the Broadway production that isn't in the movie (which is totally understandable once you've seen both versions).

You really can have intelligent, heavy drama on Broadway.  Even better, we get Hal Prince's ingenious staging (several metal bridges and a square box), Sondheim's glorious music and cutting lyrics, and one of the most fabulous comic duets ever written ""A Little Priest.""  Other songs like ""Epiphany"", ""Pretty Women"", and ""Johanna"" (Act II) show how music can play an equal partner with plot/action to create a moving thriller.  With many musicals and operas, it seems like we're just there to swallow sugary melodies or admire the glories of the human voice.  With Sondheim musicals, I feel like I'm watching a great play that is enhanced by music.  The musical is tightly written with many simultaneous actions going on at the same time, yet it's not hard to follow.

I have only a few minor criticisms.  Angela Lansbury is a fantastic actress, playing a deceptively evil monster of a woman.  However, I never felt like she was madly in love with Sweeney, which would somewhat justify her horrific actions.  Maybe I'm a romantic, but I like characters to be sympathetic and Lansbury's Mrs. Lovett just seems like pure evil.  I had more fun with Patti LuPone's portrayal in the concert DVD, which has no subtlety but is much more comic and sexy.  While George Hearn is very good (except for his somewhat-over-the-top ""Epiphany""), I prefer his performance in the concert DVD.  As many people have already said, the woman who plays Johanna has a terrible voice; just hold your breath through ""Green Finch and Linnet Bird.""  In summary, this is a wonderful video of a musical masterpiece and if you like it, you should get the concert DVD, too!",1201305600,,1839,4.890322580645162
1460822,4,B00005JL6V,"Stephen Sondheim's SWEENEY TODD: THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET opened on Broadway on 1 March 1979 with Len Cariou and Angela Lansbury in the leading roles. Although it swept virtually every award imaginable, the box office fell short of expectations and the original production ended its run at 557 performances. Fortunately, however, the play then went on tour--and along the way was captured on film. The result is a remarkable capture of the play featuring George Hern, who replaced Cariou, and Lansbury in a close approximation of the original Broadway staging.

There is, however, a flaw. Simply stated: stage plays do not film very well, for a performance that works well on the stage must fill the theatre and is therefore very, very large--and when placed on film such performances often seem slightly static, opressively aggressive, or both. SWEENEY TODD is no exception. Seen on film, it has a ""stand and sing"" quality, and while both Hern and Lansbury seem to have modulated their performances for the sake of the camera such is not the case with Betsy Joslyn as Joanna; her larger-than-life performance reads on film as unpleasantly frantic and her extremely operatic voice feels out of place when contrasted with the voices of the overall cast.

Taking this stage-play-on-film effect into consideration, however, this really is an exceptional performance of a unique and macabrely comic musical in the operetta style. Lansbury is astonishing, a mixture of silliness, stupidity, and cunning malice, while Hern truly owns the role of the psychotic barber whose clients ""go to their graves impeccably shaved."" The overall cast is quite fine and although the film does not let us see quite enough of the set, there is enough on display for it to be impressive. And the music! Who can argue with what most consider Sondheim's finest work?

The story itself is extremely well-known, particularly in England. In 1846 Thomas Peckett Prest cobbled together several urban myths for a short story he titled A STRING OF PEARLS; within a year or so it was adapted to the stage as SWEENEY TODD, THE DEMON BARBER OF FLEET STREET--and, in an era that knew little of copyright law, variations of the play were soon playing all over England. Each one, however, was more or less the same: Sweeney Todd, a barber, kills the men who come to him for a shave; Mrs. Lovett, his associate, bakes them up into pies and feeds them to an unsuspecting public. The Sondheim version is specifically based on a 1973 version by Christopher Bond.

The story is very Grand Guignol, with a lot of blood, bodies dropping down chutes, and grotestque humor; at the same time, however, the music, lyics, and subplot of an innocent in the clutches of evil open out the subject to numerous lyric charms one would not expect. Sondheim's lyrics are often ironic, but never more so than here; he intertwines a great deal of wicked satire re industry and capitalism along the way, and certainly one cannot fault the strange yet Victorian-elegant of his complex music.

Like the ""concert version"" starring Hern and Patti LuPone, this particular film also provides us with several selections that were cut from the 2007 Tim Burton film version, most particularly the opening ""Attend the Tale of Sweeney Todd,"" which runs like a thread throughout the play. It is also, in my opinion, considerably more comic than the film, which tends to underplay comedy in favor of a still greater show of blood. Whatever the case, if you are a fan of the story, this is the legendary Broadway show on tour, and it is a knock-out. Recommended.

I enjoyed it then!!--George Hearn and Angela Lansbury shine!!
Now, some 25+ years later, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have revived
and revamped this Stephen Sondheim classic and brilliantly
brought it to the screen with lots more flair and colors!
But this performance is the one that got the ball bouncing!
It's raw and boiled down, but it still has it's charm.

Except for Lansbury's performance, there's entirely too much about this production that makes the more recent concert version more recommendable.  For starters, the camerawork doesn't age well, with cheesy closeup shots that steal thunder from the hugeness of the staging.  This is hardly a deal-breaker though; however the supporting performances are.  Hearn and Lansbury are great.  Lyndeck is good.  The young lovers on the other hand are wretched.  The actress who plays Johanna makes this DVD nearly impossible for me to watch.

Of course those are personal problems; your mileage may vary.  The transfer is decent, preserving the quality of the '82 video.  I'm glad to own this for archival purposes.

1460876,5,B00005JL6V,"One of the greatest pieces of musical theatre ever written by the greatest composer and lyricist ever born, Stephen Sondheim, and this particular production of it is flawless.  A gothic melodrama with no happy ending, Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, stirs all of one's emotions.  It will make you shudder, it will make you laugh, it will make you weep, and it will make you nod your head in agreement at the vengeful acts of this ""demon"" barber.

As perfect a cast as one could dream of, headed by George Hearn and Angela Lansbury, supported by an equally perfect ensemble of actors.  I have seen productions with far less talented actors that, while impossible to disguise the brilliance of music and lyrics, have been travesties.  So thank God for this amazing cast and for the fact that it is available on DVD to enjoy forever. Buy it, watch it and be gripped by every note of this amazing score, the brilliance of Sondheim's lyrics and Hugh Wheeler's book.

I began this review by calling Sweeney Todd one of the greatest pieces of musical theatre ever written.  It is difficult for me to choose what I would call THE greatest, but I can tell you this:  all of those that would qualify for that label are shows containing music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, or, in the case of ""Gypsy"" and ""West Side Story"", his lyrics.  Thankful that the original productions of ""Sunday In The Park With George"", ""Into the Woods"" and ""Passion"" have been recorded, I only wish we could have visual records of all the others: Assassins; Company; Follies; Pacific Overtures; A Little Night Music; Merrily We Roll Along; Gypsy, etc.",1163376000,7,1635,4.688811188811189

While the  production lacks some of the punch -- and a few of the details -- and has lost a bit of the scale of the original New York offering, it does capture the essential spirit of the play.

I'd give it 3.5 stars (out of 5) if I could.  Since I can't I'll round it out to 4.",1155600000,,436,4.216867469879518
1460878,3,B00005JL6V,"Warmly remembering the original London Production at Drury Lane in the early 1980's, and only having seen this version once on a washed out VHS tape many years ago, it's great to finally see the original Broadway Production on DVD. I live in the UK, and this NTSC region 1 disc played fine on my Multiregion player.

Having seen other productions of Sweeney over the last decade, in many ways this TV production feels very stilted, filmed in a massive theatre for camera, but with hideous canned laughter and applause which set one's teeth on edge, and only serve to slow down the pace of the drama. It's something like hearing a composer's masterpiece with the underscore from a miserable sitcom.

Despite surround remastering, the audio quality here is still very limited, and gives little scope for Sondheim's masterly score in sonic terms. Neither does it do the cast justice.

Such a shame this TV production wasn't taped in front of a real audience, allowing the cast greater freedom and spotaneity, particularly in the dialogue. Act one in particular is somewhat leaden. ''Swing your razor wide Sweeney'' should send shivers down the spine, but here there is little electricity.

 Some of the embarrasingly inauthentic East London and Irish accents are an irritant throughout, often bringing to mind Dick van Dyck's remarkable mummerset in ''Mary Poppins''. (This seems to bother American viewers less, however.)

Lansbury and Hearn are a marvellous double act, but best see Hearn (who deservedly won an award for his Sweeney here) in the live recording from San Francisco on DVD, with a world class symphony orchestra and chorus, in a convincing (semi-staged) performance with a stronger supporting cast overall, and very high production standards throughout the recording.

This original production stressed the melodrama of the Demon Barber story, but on the showing of this TV version, slightly missed the quintissential black-comedy and bristling energy of this multi-faceted musical thriller. Such a shame the original London show (which rather bemused the London public back then) wasn't recorded, as the late Dennis Quilley as Sweeney and Sheila Hancock as Lovett were also a fabulous double act, and caught a great deal more of the gritty London irony at the heart of this show.

Worth seeing, but the level of 80's TV production is a mixed bag, and the overall result is strangely dated, though it's good to have a record of this original Broadway production. A pity there are no extras relating to the original poduction, design, cast and the composer.

If you must see a Sweeney on DVD at present, (and for those who are seeing the piece for the first time) the San Francisco live performance is a more exciting experience. Although semi-staged, (costumed but with minimal props and no scenery) the drama is far tighter, it's musically thrilling and there is a real sense of ''occasion'', with excellent singing and acting from a cast of highly talented Opera and Music Theatre principals.

Hearn is impressive in the Broadway production, but utterly mesmerising in front of a live audience on the San Francisco DVD. There are also good extras with rehearsal footage, interviews (including Sondheim himself) and the performance history of the piece.

Let's hope that another, and more convincingly three dimensional theatre production of this great show makes it to DVD soon.",1155513600,12,3394,5.086330935251799

1460937,4,B00005JL6V,"I bought this DVD because I had heard some of the music selections on a satellite radio ""Broadway's Best"" channel, and became curious about the story line behind the music.  It seems this was a filmed version of the stage production which was broadcast on TV.  The musical numbers are catchy and entertaining.  Turning on the closed caption feature reveals all the clever and humerous lyrics which were sometimes lost in the British accents.  Angela Lansbury steals the show as Nellie, although all the performances are strong and the singing voices well suited to the characters.

The story, however, is unsettling, even though I knew it was about brutal murder.  I wouldn't have gotten more than half way through this show were it not for the amazing musical numbers.  Even the ending revealed no redeeming rationale for the endless savage butchery effected without conscience.

If one is able to suspend a sense of morality and accept slaughter of human beings for fun and profit, this show can be very entertaining.  I doubt if I'll watch it again, but listening to the sound track has made more sense since I've seen the full production.

Watch this one after the kids are in bed.  An immature value system could be grossly distorted by the light treatment of savage behavior.",1151539200,,1281,4.857142857142857
1460938,5,B00005JL6V,"""Sweeney Todd"" is definitely not for everyone. I know quite a few people who think I'm demented because I like this musical so much. If you can just get past your initial impression of the murdering/cannibalism you can see how really wonderful this musical is. In my opinion this is probably the best show Sondheim has done. It's thought provoking, dark, sometimes comic, and throughout the show amazing. I, myself wasn't too fond of it the first time I saw it but, after watching the second time I fell in love with it. Perhaps the only downfall of this DVD is that Betsy Joslyn wasn't probably the best pick they could have made for the role of Johanna.",1149465600,,655,4.559322033898305
1460939,5,B00005JL6V,"I saw this on stage at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion both opening and closing nights -- glorious and hilarious!  I was absolutely bowled over and would have gone to see it once a week had my budget held out.  For years I watched a tape home-recorded off the TV until it died; then I rented it and had someone copy it (don't tell, OK?) -- both sound and picture were poor.  It finally died too.  Someone had apparently been hoarding these tapes, and selling them at very high prices, but FINALLY!!!! we can see it again in all its glory.

The minimalist, extremely clever sets are a masterpiece, especially the chorus doing all the set changing in full view of the audience, so subtly that it is hardly noticed.

The praise other reviewers have heaped upon this production is well merited and better expressed than I could.  So, in order not to belabor the obvious, I will merely touch upon the only ""weak"" spot mentioned -- Anthony and Joanna.

All the characters are grotesques of one sort of another.  However, Anthony and, especially, Joanna are, I believe, deliberately kept 2-dimensional, place-holders in the ""tied-to-the-train-tracks-rescued-in-the-nick-of-time"" school of Victorian melodrama.  Joanna does extremely well with a rather unrewarding part as a silly female.  Anthony is even better, since he entirely looks the part of the clean-cut Victorian hero-type, and his ballad ""Joanna"" is quite beautiful.  It is these two, deliberately flat and rather camp, around whom the real story swirls, as it is the evil and horrific deeds, motivations, retributions, revenge, greed and hilariously grisly action that are the real story.

I also would like to ""give a nod"" to Pirelli, another stock character taken directly from Victorian melodrama, all strut, arrogance, twirling mustachios and swirling cape.  VERY funny!

The final plot twist is all the more scarifying for the grisly cheerfulness that preceeds it.

Don't miss this.  I envy anyone lucky enough to be experiencing it for the first time!",1146268800,6,2010,5.060790273556231
1460940,4,B00005JL6V,"Without question, ""Sweeney Todd"" should be very near the top of any ranking of the Sondheim catalogue--as well as hold a place of honor in the greater history of musical theatre and opera.

It's dazzlingly sophisticated, as Sondheim's chief works are. Keeping track of each unexpected flutter in the orchestration, and each darkly comic turn of phrase is a wonderful challenge. It's also a happily accesible piece of musical theatre: soaring, sweet, thrilling, and pretty hummable to boot. I first discovered and began enjoying my dad's vinyl copy as a very young child.

That the very strong and very faithful 1982 revival was filmed, lovingly, and televised, committed to VHS and later DVD is fortunate for obvious reasons.

A few quibbles: firstly, this version can't compare in terms of quality of presentation with the VHS/DVD releases of later Sondheim works ""Sunday in the Park..."", ""Into the Woods,"" and ""Passion."" The picture is pale and a bit grainy. The sound could be richer. The camera work has its heart in the right place, but the edit never seems to find a proper balance between showing adequate views of the stage, and closer framing to pick up details. Many great moments in the performance seem wasted on awkward closeups, or odd walk-through shots. Eugene Lee's classic and brilliant set design isn't quite done justice.

The cast is mostly perfection. George Hearn has stood the test of time in the title role (see the 2001 ""Sweeney"" concert film with Patti LuPone for proof). Lansbury more or less IS the batty Mrs. Lovett, playing the role she seems to have been born to. I DO have a bit of a problem with Betsy Joslyn as Johanna, who (in my opinion) overdoes the character's cooped-up oddball persona, never quite presenting a young woman I could sympatize with, or imagine falling for. Her Johanna is barely human, all flapping eyelids and funny faces.

Small complaints, though, when dealing with Sweeney Todd--a difficult show to muck up.

Don't miss the very good DVD recordings of ""Passion"" and ""Into the Woods,"" as well as the absolutely perfect DVD presentation of ""Sunday in the Park.""",1145750400,,2118,4.935393258426966
1460941,5,B00005JL6V,"It's difficult to know where to begin when talking about a musical such as this one.  Considered by many (admittedly, myself included) to be Stephen Sondheim's greatest masterpiece, the complexity and incredible depth, both musical and lyrical, of SWEENEY TODD is remarkable.

This particular DVD recording stars the incredible Angela Lansbury (cf. MAME) as Ms. Nellie Lovett, an off-kilter, darkly humorous, and downright goofy (at times) peddler of meat pies in her own shop in London.  For those unfamiliar with Lansbury's singing voice, do yourself a favor and get acquainted with it here.  Ms. Lovett's character calls for a certain quirkiness (she bakes people into meat pies, for goodness sake!), and Lansbury's vocals seem a perfect match for the role.

George Hearn stars as Sweeney Todd (aka Benjamin Barker), a man pushed and pulled in every way by a life that has been anything but fair to him.  A puppet to the whimsy of those around him, Todd's mental instability rears its ugly head in the form of murder when he elects to dispose of those who take a seat in his chair for a shave and haircut.  Mr. Todd and Ms. Lovett soon team up, both having a somewhat obvious yet sad need for affection.  A generally strong supporting cast make this production nothing short of outstanding.

With that said, I agree with others in that the DVD quality could be improved.  Still, I'm surprised and thankful that this particular 1982 performance, during a national tour, was recorded and released on DVD.  The preservation of Hearn's chemistry with Lansbury is a remarkable accomplishment in itself, as their interactions make Sondheim's complex score even more powerful.

In the end, SWEENEY TODD is nothing short of a musical theater gem.  The vocals, particularly from Hearn and Lansbury, are top-notch and the lyrics and music from Sondheim are, in my opinion, some of the best ever written and composed.  After all, creating a musical thriller that is creepy, quirkily humorous, suspenseful, and moving -- all at the same time -- is no easy task.

I would suggest getting acquainted with SWEENEY, then move on to some of Sondheim's other outstanding musicals, such as ANYONE CAN WHISTLE (also featuring Angela Lansbury), INTO THE WOODS, PASSION, SUNDAY IN THE PARK WITH GEORGE, and many others.

If you don't know sweeney todd, it is a fantastic musical.  It doesn't have catchy songs that make you sing them on the way out, but the script is quite strong and Sondheim writes a terrific musical in general.  This one is deep.  Latent with subtext.

In his ""Into the woods"", I was blown away when Jack's mother, describing the cow she wanted Jack to get rid of, said ""Her withers wither with her."" Who else could exhibit such creativity?

However- I digress. Sweeney Todd is a magnificent play-the music is appropriately dark, and the words are equally dark, befitting the mood of the play. And yet- at the same time it is outrageously funny! I have seen the play live as well as the video and believe it is well deserved of all the accolades it has received. George Hearn is over the top- to get into character must have taken a Herculean effort- surprised that he could ever come out of it! Fantastic production- especially in the set design which deserves much kudos as well.

Although the quality is a bit low, and the special features are pretty much nil, this DVD is still an excellent choice. I feel that George Hearn is better than the original Sweeney, Len Cariou.

Sondheim's bloody tale of revenge is very much like a Count of Monte Cristo tale gone bad. Imprisoned unjustly for 15 years, the barber Benjamin Barker returns to find that his wife poisoned himself after being raped by the very judge who imprisoned him. The judge also adopted, and now intends to marry Barker's 16 year old daughter. Teaming up with his old Landlady (and maker of the ""worst pies in London""), Nellie Lovett, and taking a new name, Barker becomes Sweeney Todd. Bent of vengeance, Todd goes mad and begins his bloody vengeance. When forced to find a way to get rid of the bodies, Lovett comes up with a novel idea. Soon she is selling the best pies in London. However Todd's path to vengeance will twist in ways you never expected until the tragic end.

1461039,5,B00005JL6V,"To witness this production of Sweeney Todd for the first time is to be truly shocked and thrilled by a stage production for the very first time!

Angela Landsbury and George Hearn bring the production fully forward off the small screen right into your living room. Len Cariou is on the definitive soundtrack recording, but Hearn is just as good, in my humble opinion.

Sweeney Todd (Hearn) is a wronged man who uses his barber's chair to right the wrongs he perceives are done to him. He inlists the assistance of slovenly meat pie maker Mrs. Lovett (Landsbury). Together they begin to not only dispatch with quite a few residents of Fleet Street, but Mrs. Lovett puts the corpses to good use as filling for her pies.

That is the nuts and bolts of the story. I won't expand beyond that, because there is a wonderful twist that makes it all the more satisfying when you see it for the first time.

Sondheim has never been one of my favorites. I tend to run to the more predictable and (some say) pedestrain: Rogers and Hammerstein...

However, Sweeney Todd is my absolute favorite musical, regardless. I must confess, actually, that it is THIS production of Sweeney Todd that is my favorite. Sondheim's music is elaborate and involved. It is far more reminescent of opera than, say, a Lloyd Webber musical. Sondheim doesn't rely on repetition, rather he stretches his legs and uses ""themes"" as did the great opera composers of the 19th century.

Once you've seen Angela Landsbury playing Mrs. Lovett you'll never be able to watch another episode of Murder She Wrote thinking of her in the same way. While Sweeney is as mad as a hatter, it is Mrs. Lovet's cold calculating complicity and malice of fore thought that make her the more evil of the two.

When that screeching whistle goes off, the chills run up my spine, because I know that someone else is dead.

The staging of this production is impeccible. The chair that Sweeney has devised to drop his victims down to Mrs. Lovett's shop below is horribly gruesome as is the manner in which he dispatches them.

All the more gruesome is the quite funny, macabre ""A Little Priest"".

The music is not actually beautiful, but at the same time it is terribly beautiful. In fact, the subject matter itself warrants a far less ""beautiful"" score. Oh, there are loving songs and tender ones, but in the end, it is a musical about corruption and deception and, quite plainly, murder.

Get this! You will simply eat it up!  :-)",1135900800,4,2468,4.6482758620689655

1461052,4,B00005JL6V,"I would like to begin by stating that while I am not an avid Sondheim fan, I do love his Sweeney Todd and Sunday in the Park with George.  I have not seen the latter, but I bought Sweeney Todd today after having enjoyed the album for quite some time.

Sweeney Todd is the perfect mix of dark humor, horror, and even a bit of romance (which is still tarted up).  The story is chilling and parts of Mr. Sondheim's score give me shivers (but you can read more about that in my review of the original cast recording).

The video quality is very good considering that it was meant just to be a television boradcast.  It even won an Emmy for Best Editing, and while watching it becomes clear that they certainly did have a very, very good editor on the job.  The fades and cuts are perfectly timed so that music and actions remain in synch (unlike the video recording of Cats, which is clearly compiled from multiple recordings and has some shabby editing).  The camera agles are also perfect for capturing the true essence of this show, and reveal things that we would not have seen were we sitting in the audience.

The performers are wonderful.  Patti LuPone was wonderful in concert, but nobody can beat Angela Lansbury.  This role was perfect for her acting and singing abilities.  George Hearn makes a perfect Sweeney Todd and I actually favor him over Len Cariou of the original cast.  (I have never seen Cariou in performance, but on the album all he is dling is singing the part.)  Hearn's Sweeney actually develops from angry prisoner to insane barber, while Cariou just seemed angry through the whole thing.  The supporting cast is wonderful as well, though vocally I prefer Sarah Rice as Joanna.

The reason I only give this four stars is because of the cuts that were made.  Judge Turpin's version of Joanna has never been in the actual show (it was in previews but cut.  The song appears on the album).  It would've been nice, however, to have it in this special TV boradcast since it actually helps with character development for Judge Turpin.  With it, he is shown as a desperate man who knows he must try to stop his impure thoughts towards Joanna.  Without it, he is nothing but a dirty, perverted old man.  I also miss the tooth-pulling part of the contest between Todd and Pirelli.  I suppose it was removed from the TV performance so it wouldn't scare younger viewers from the dentist, but should anyone under 9 even be watching this without an adult?

I would really prefer to give it 4.5 stars, but I decided to round down when it came to my final score since it is not perfect.",1122249600,2,2595,4.497863247863248
1461053,5,B00005JL6V,"This Stephen Sondheim at his most devilish.  As a music teacher, the musicianship of the cast and orchestra is over the top.  This musical is not for the meek of heart.  If you are the type who enjoys Oklahoma and Mary Poppins and believes Godspell and Hair is too much.  Don't watch this show!  The melodies are difficult to latch onto and whistle on the way out the door.  Though you won't be able to get them out of your head.  They will be incomplete and persistent.

  George Hearn palys the title character.  His voice is one of the strongest and most versatile you will ever hear.  He is capable of incomparable sweetness followed by unbeliveable madness.  Angela Lansbury while not an ingenue any longer, her Mrs. Lovett is just as crazy as Todd, but it is a subtle lunacy on the same lines as the women in ""Arsenic and Old Lace"".

  This musical doesn't have same whimsy as ""Into The Woods"", but is just as powerful.  You hope that Todd will overcome his demons and embrace life with his daughter. But...",1121731200,,1013,4.478021978021978
1461054,4,B00005JL6V,"Broadway musical performed before a live Los Angeles audience, based on a 19th Century British urban legend, if you will, about a barber, (George Hearn) who cuts the throats of his clients, and his lady friend co-hort, (Angela Lansbury) who bakes the victims into meat pies. But before you can say, 'Little Shop of Rocky Horrors', know that ""Sweeney Todd"" takes itself very seriously; Stephen Sondheim's majestic and fun score is based on traditional opera, and it is an almost overwhelming musical delight of Broadway heaven with sweeping, complex and tuneful musical arrangements.

It also has a slight case of indulgence. While the melodramatic book of a barber incensed with revenge over an unjust prison sentence is certainly emotional and involving, the comedic and horrific killing rampage almost gets out of hand for it's sheer vivid and realistic cruelty, and the unlikelihood of the two killers easily slicing the throats of random barber shop patrons and turning them into meat pies, without so much as a missing person report filed, rocks the realm a bit. These scenes seem to be the equivalent of the opera lady with a ram's horns helmet on. The book succeeds in celebrating the unity of the worst and meekest of humankind, and tries, sometimes successfully, to deliver the message that we are all killers at heart, so forcefully that you may find yourself silently re-commiting to a pro or con capital punishment or abortion agenda.

While the song, ""A Little Priest"" goes on far too long in a cutesy bad pun lyric of the various pies certain dead men would make, - ""The clergy is too coarse and too mealy"", and the bright zippy ""By The Sea"" seems from another show entirely, (although it does establish Angela Lansbury's character's own desires and hopes),  the rest of the music absolutely shines in accordance with it's theme. There is a moment of near ecstacy as the company marvels over the satisfaction garnered from consumption of the pies in ""God That's Good"", one of many musical highlights. The company is thoroughly and equally excellent from George Hearn's Lon Chaney-like, obsessed and fiendish, yet gentlemanly Todd, down to the least chorus member.

The DVD itself is not very special, with average sound quality, and there is some question as to the 'live' recording, as audience and players sometimes seem out of sync with each other, and players at times appear to be lip-singing. It doesn't diminish the general high standards of the production. It is a fine documentation of one of Broadway's most memorable and bizarre moments.

1461055,4,B00005JL6V,"This is an amazing production of Sweeney Todd. I also own a copy of the concert production on DVD. It is interesting to see the real thing. The unit set is amazing with platforms and the cast moving iron-railed staircases around and doors opening. The performances are great. George Hearn stands out among the crowd but what is with that hairdo? He is just as good as in the concert. Angela Lansbury is enjoyable but I have to say that Patti Lupone's interpretation was more subtle and more human. Angela Lansbury is just a bit too vaudeville in this. Betsy Joslyn and Chris Groenendaal were at first a bit over the top but when you think about it, this is supposed to be a spoof of lighthearted operettas in that this show isn't so lighthearted. These two are every inch the melodramatic hero and heroine with great voices to match. The woman who plays the Beggar Woman needs to work on her British accent. It sounded like a really bad Irish accent. Pirelli has a great voice and a good stage presence. Edmund Lyndeck is every inch the corrupt individual as Judge Turpin. He also has a surprisingly good voice. I hadn't heard him sing because I first saw him in Into the Woods. However, one song I wish they had kept in the show was the Judge's version of ""Johanna"" which helps to explain his character. Without it, the Judge is little more than a dirty old man. I felt that Lyndeck was a little too leering with his eyes and his muttered, ""Oh, yes, yes"". I felt that the Judge in the concert had more of a presence. The Beadle looked like he was wearing mascara. Finally, Ken Jenning's voice is somewhat uneven. I've heard ""Not While I'm Around"" played on the radio (I'm from Massachusetts, we have a college station that plays all forms of music) and his voice seems stronger. Also, I felt that in comparison with Ken Jenning's performance, Neal Patrick Harris brought more of a humanity to the part in the concert. But beggars can't be choosers. But this is a great production. Even though it's not the real thing on Broadway, it gives me enough of a hint of what it was like. I loved it.",1104019200,3,2092,4.464751958224543
1461056,5,B00005JL6V,"That is to say,those two listed works represent the two greatest achievements in american musical theatre history(The jurys in).One,a ""folk"" opera-as Gershwin refered to it,and ""Todd"" a ""black Operetta""(that has the unique honor of being the only B-way show in history being done in opera houses worldwide-sorry, the Met has not mounted ""Cats"" or ""Phantom""yet) as Sondheim refers to it. There are no other shows that come any where near the combination of genius,artistry,craft,and entertainment, that these two do. West side story?,Show Boat?,a far third and fourth. Actually,i would put Sondheim's Pacific Overtures as my ""up for grabs"" third choice. I can't say that the music of ST is quite on the same level as Porgy(of which all of scene one and act 1 through ""robbins burial fund raising"",is unapproachable),however,ST is a better theater piece than Porgy. The plot,structure,characters,and climaxes,are much more developed and interesting( and less one dimensional)than in porgy. However, both were conceived in a ""timeless"" fashion and style,and therefore both are timeless-as all great art and music is. About this dvd? Most of the original cast is here. And as such,it's a truly authentic rendering of( what was at the time of it's taping in 1982) a relitvely new work. I was 21 when i saw this production in L.A.I also ""attended the tale"" in 1980,for the N.Y. production (at the uris- now the Gershwin theatre),also with Hearn i believe. Sondheim's weaving and re-working(re-using-reprises of motifs,songs)of his truly inspired musical material(to say nothing of his briliant lyrics)is sheer genius. The pace of the last 20 minutes of this piece is incredible. It's like the last 20 minutes of ""Good-Fellas"",it doesen't let up.during Todd and Lovetts final exchange, before and after he waltzes her to a fiery demise(the greatest climactic part of the entire show-musically or otherwise),we hear fragments of four previous songs.""poor thing"",""a little priest"",""by the sea"",""and,"" a barber and his wife""(all over the beggar womans motifs in the strings-alms,alms-""lucy""-sheer inspiration).Sondheim's genius for puzzles was never more apparent then in the solving of this supreme musical puzzle. Sweeney Todd. A final word on the timeless appeal of this show-My brother, who generally speaking, abhors the ""Broadway""sound(i.e. He grew up on rock),and who is not a ""fan"" of musical theater per se(i.e. He grew up on rock concerts),absolutely loves ST.so do others like him,whom i have turned on to ST.So,if that's""You sir..no one's in the chair c'mon C'MON!....

1461057,5,B00005JL6V,"In days of yore musical theater was a vast cornucopia of huge, exotic, and powerful characters. Mostly villains, these were loudmouthed, fiendishly overbearing people who had an ax to grind against God, and humanity at large. They were tragic, anti-heroes, exploding with rage, and deliciously evil. Doomed, but sympathetic.

Now things have changed. Nowadays the average Broadway show contains a bunch of whiny, down-to-earth wussies who spend more time yowling out tired love-ballads, and feeling sorry for themselves then they actually spend living their lives. This hasn't always been the case. If Sweeney Todd got pissed off at somebody he killed them. Today, if a character gets pissed off he decides not to pay his rent. Ooh, scary! In the old days when characters had a disagreement they ended up getting into knife-fights. Now if characters disagree they go into therapy and talk it out. Then they sing a song about it. BOOORING!

Thank God for Stephen Sondheim. He was, and still is a master at portraying the dark side of the human spirit. His songs shock the monkey even to this day. It's unfortunate that the so-called ""Golden Era"" of musical theater ended some time at the end of the 1960s, because I would definitely rank Sweeney Todd among one of the top ten shows of all time. Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett should be the quintessential ""How To"" guides for any aspiring musical theater practitioner, and as much as I like ""Rocky Horror,"" and ""Little Shop"" they will never be able to compete with the Broadway masterpiece that is ""Sweeney Todd.""",1095120000,7,1559,4.923954372623574

1461059,5,B00005JL6V,"""Sweeney Todd"" has been out of print for many, many years.  Video copies went for enormous sums, and I had to settle for an aging video copy I recorded when the show was first aired on television  22 years ago. I understood that there were some copyright issues that stopped the show from being re-released, which have apparently been resolved.
Although I usually curse Warner Brothers for having the worst track record of any major studio for not releasing their extensive library of films to DVD, today I applaud them for giving us back this wonderful show with its delightful performances on DVD.  Not only can we relish Angela Lansbury in her Tony-winning role as Mrs. Lovett, but we get the extra bonus of seeing George Hearn as Sweeney, to my mind the best Sweeney I've ever seen (and I've seen two others as well -- Len Cariou, who originated the role on Broadway and was probably the sexiest Sweeney (making Lovett's attraction for him perfectly understandable), but without Hearn's depth and a bit too American (or rather, Canadian), and Denis Quilley, who performed the role in London.  Although Quilley's acting and singing talents were a match for Hearn's, he was physically not exactly right.
As for the Mrs. Lovetts I've seen, the West End production's  Sheila Hancock will always be my favorite for her ability to capture all the comedic aspects of the role (as Angela Lansbury does too) while still managing to plumb the pure evil depths and total amorality of the character.  Ms. Hancock had the ability to make the theatre-goer laugh his head off one moment, and then to send chills down his spine the next.  But who could not love Angela as well?  And aside from Ms. Lansbury, one gets a chance to see several others from the original Broadway cast reprise their roles for this production, including the wonderfully sinister, powerfully voiced Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin and Ken Jennings as Tobias. (Toby is not an easy role to cast, since one has to practically be a castrato to sing it.)
I was also fortunate enough to see the original Broadway production before the cuts were made -- the shortening of the barber competition (a wise decision), the elimination of the self-flagellation scene in which Judge Turpin, brandishing a whip, is seen in a black robe, his buttocks exposed (this should never have been cut but was probably considered too outragious for the out-of-town tourists to handle), and the removal of the Tower of Bray number (which, again, was a wonderful pastiche and very funny, as it added to rather than detracted from the suspense, and hopefully will one day be re-evaluated and restored to future productions).  But at least, the missing numbers are all on the cast album for admirers of the show to enjoy.
The role of Anthony was replaced in this production by Cris Groenendaal (who was in the chorus in the original), and who has a stronger voice than Victor Garber, who originated the role, but Garber is a stronger actor, as can be surmised from his long and successful career, both in musicals and non-musicals. I also enjoyed Betsy Joslyn as Johanna, which is a silly and comedic role which she milks for all its worth, and yet still remains a chip off the old block.  It's Johanna, after all, who grabs the revolver from Anthony to shoot Mr. Fogg in cold blood.
Finally, before receiving the DVD, I was fearful that I might be looking at something with faded color bleeds and poor video quality simply transferred to a different media.  But I am happy to report that the show has held up well, both visually and audibly.  In fact, in this L.A. production, the only thing I missed from the Broadway production (other than the cut numbers) was that in the original theatre, Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett make their final appearance rising through a hole in the floor from an elevator beneath the stage, as if coming back from hell for a brief encore.

Even though the production was getting sort of old at the point this was shot, and you can tell that Angela is sort of tired of playing Mrs. Lovett. Its still a thrill to have this preserved. The cast is AMAZING. Even though Angela seems bored, she is still wonderful and electrifies the stage with her presence and talent. Its no wonder she won a Tony for basically every major Broadway Show she ever did. Hearn is ofcourse, AMAZING. His acting isn't as good as Cariou's, and I find Cariou scarier, but his singing is just sooooo good, and even though his characterization isn't my favorite, he gives his Sweeney a lot of dimensions, making you see that Sweeney Todd was once a good man and isn't just an insane mad man, even though I prefer that.
The supporting cast is wonderful. I know everyone hates the Johanna, Betsy Joslyn, and even though I must admit her performance is a bit odd and her voice seems to be struggling, I love it. SHe makes Johanna into a complete nut and is completely insane, adding something even creepier about her character and her relationship with the Judge. I mean, hello, she has been molested by the judge her entire life and is kept inside ALL the time. I find it a bt ridiculous when Johanna is played all pretty and nieve.

It's a joy to have this video reappear on DVD and my heartfelt thanks go to whoever managed to clear to rights in order to let Warner Brothers issue it.
The glaring defect of this production is the casting of George Hearn as the title character. Like Blanche Dubois in ""Streetcar"", Sweeney is an everyman driven insane by circumstance and the awful realization of just how cruel people and life can be.  It's a slow, painful descent into madness.  Unfortunately Hearn chooses to play him as a full-blown looney from the gate so that not only is there no place for him to go with the character, but the pivotal ""Epiphany"" becomes nothing more than a grandstanding exercise in sceneary chewing rather than the onstage unraveling of a person's sanity that it should be.  I only wish I could have seen the original Sweeney, Len Cariou, do this number on-stage.  His delivery on the original Broadway cast recording builds from a slow rage to an almost orgasmic explosion of inner pain.

1461116,5,B00005JL6V,"""Sweeney Todd"" is considered by many to be one of the best musicals ever written and a personal best for composer/lyricist Stephen Sondheim.  And trust me, folks, the personal best of the man behind such beloved musicals as ""Company,"" ""Funny Thing..."" and ""Into the Woods"" is a sight to behold.  Not only is the show recognized as a modern classic in musical theatre circles, but has even found a place in the repetoire of opera houses around the country.  This recording preserves the tour of the original production, with most of the sets and Hal Prince's original Broadway staging intact.  You get all of Sondheim's gloriously complex score and the few but ever-so-important book scenes done in full costume, props and all.  George Hearn is brilliant in the title role, and all of the actors do a fine job with their roles (with the exception of the actress playing Johanna, who sings prettily but tries too hard to get laughs out of a character not written for laughs).
But the real treasure of this disc is Angela Lansbury, whose Tony-winning Mrs. Lovett is worth the price of admission alone.  Her coniving, scheming gem of a pie shop owner is one of Broadway's legendary performances, and we are truly lucky that the performance was preserved for future generations.  She seems to be in even better voice than on the original cast recording, absolutely owns the stage, and plays wonderfully off of George Hearn's Sweeney.  Many fine and talented actresses have done wonderful things with the role (witness the stellar Patti LuPone in the 2001 concert version if you don't believe me), but Angela Lansbury will always own what is without a doubt one of the greatest roles in the entire musical theatre cannon.  Fans of the show, Sondheim, or musicals in general owe it to themselves to pick up this DVD and experience one of the most darkly comic musicals ever written, featuring one of the finest star turns ever.",1084060800,11,1920,4.811550151975684

I have always had minor reservations about Betsy Joslyn's cross-eyed Joanna and some of the cuts made in the show: The tooth-pulling section of ""The Contest"", the Judge's whipping number, and most of the ""Parlour Songs"" were trimmed form the show due to overlength. The road tour set is not as elaborate as the one used on Broadway (in the opening and closing numbers Sweeney Todd rose out of the stage on a lift... very effective!) but this is the SWEENEY TODD that Hal Prince staged.
One other bit of good news that no one else here has mentioned: There are subtitles so you can follow along the trickier lyrics. Strange that there are none on the DVD's of INTO THE WOODS, PASSION or SUNDAY IN THE PARK.  It's most welcome on SWEENEY TODD.
Of course it is best to see stage musicals live in the theatre, but this video production offers a good approximation of what it was like when SWEENEY TODD was unleashed on us 25 years ago.",1083715200,47,1595,4.527777777777778

Forget Rent, Les Mis, or even Mamma Mia or Wicked.  This show should be the raison d'etre for musical theatre.  This is the most captivating show ever.  Not only is there spectacle (Hal Prince in his hey-day) but the music is just breath taking: scary, sweet, shocking (I love the ending- just listening to it gives me chills).  Onto the movie, I watched it this summer at CMU and I knew the music, but never actually seen the show (knowing the music is basically knowing the show). The staging is perfect - the casting is near perfect (besides the mistake that is Johanna - but she can be overlooked) and I just love it.

Yes, this is one of the best musicals of all time and yes, these are some of the best performances ever recorded- but the horrid sound mix drops the audience reactions down to an almost imperceptible level and this is a bad thing. A VERY bad thing.
  DO NOT BE CONNED into believing this is something you should overlook and not be concerned with. To actually get the vibe that you're enjoying a communal experience with a live audience, to get that electrical jolt from them as they respond with laughter, gasps and waves of applause just as the performers heard them on stage, is to partake in something almost transcendent; something magical even.
  Instead we're left with a cold document of a distant musical event, bereft of the warm  energetic you-are-there feeling the earlier version excelled in communicating. Imagine, if you will, Judy at Carnegie Hall, Elvis in Vegas or the Beatles on Ed Sullivan without the audience reaction and you'll have an idea of why this version of Sweeny Todd should be ignored. We've waited this long, I suppose we can wait a little while longer. Shame! Shame! Shame on Warner Home Video.

1461170,5,B00005JL6V,"Without a doubt, ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" is the greatest achievement of the greatest writer of lyrics and music for the Broadway stage, Stephen Sondheim.  I hesitate to call it the best musical ever, I'm a big ""Les Miz"" fan, but without ""Sweeney,"" there would be no ""Les Miz,"" and modern musical theatre could not survive that.  ""Rent"" couldn't do it by itself!  Not with all of these Lloyd Webber shows that are called the best ever, yet they all lack, oh what is it called?  Oh yeah, A STORY LINE!

On the other hand, ""Sweeney"" is full of one of the best story lines ever.  A great book by Hugh Wheeler, in addition to Sondheim's genius.  I just got the DVD about three days ago, and I've already watched it FIVE TIMES!  I'm not much for horror films, books, or plays, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this!  (Did I mention I LOVE it?)  Anyone who hasn't seen ""Sweeney"" because they have a weak stomach, don't worry.  It's not frightening as much as it's haunting (yes, they are two different things), thanks to Sondheim's truly brillent score.  Everytime he slits a throat, it would look real from an audience seat, but on this taping, each kill is a close up, so you can easily tell the troat is okay.  Not that there was any worry about the actors actually being killed on stage, but still.

What is missing from this?  Not much, if anything.  Maybe Len Cariou as Todd, but I like George Hearn better anyway, as well as his playing of Sweeney.  Angela Lansbury is a goddess, of course, and if it needed proving, she comes through here.  The music is some of the best ever written, musical theatre or not.

Thank God for Stephen Sondheim by buying this DVD!  If you like great theatre, great music, great suspence, great acting, or great pies, this is a DVD you can not live without.  Go ahead, try it.  I dare you!",1083369600,4,1837,4.404761904761905

George Hearn acts Sweeney better than the originator Len Cariou did, if not quite as frightening (Cariou was Frankenstein from the moment he stepped on stage, no arc). Angela Lansbury's performance is legendary and shadows the part much as Merman shadowed ""Gypsy"". Hearn actually freed her up, she's more colorful here than she was on Broadway. Most of the cast is either original or an improvement, the only exception being the vulgar Betsy Joslin as the ingenue. This is like having a film of Merman's tour of ""Gypsy"" and my only complaint is: where is the commentary by Sondheim, Lansbury and/or Prince?

Sweeney Todd is, quite easily, one of the Ten Best Broadway Musicals of all time.  It is definitely Sondheim's best work.  Unfortunately, it looks like there will never be a movie made - but perhaps with this DVD, we don't need one.
This disc is so valuable because it captures the performance of Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovitt - one of the great musical performances of all time and the greatest of her career.  It also captures the original stage direction by Harold Prince.  The recording took place in Los Angeles, while the show was on tour.  By that time, George Hearn had replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney.

Played with all the demanding bravura a lurid Grand Guignol story like this calls for, the minimalist sets only enhance the spectacular performances and songs---including ""Pretty Women"", ""Nothing's Gonna Harm You"", ""Joanna"" and of course ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"". Hearn is THE perfect Sweeney Todd, wielding revenge with his razor and providing Mrs. Lovett with the perfect meat for her failing meat pie business in a seedy Victorian London neighborhood.

1461347,5,B00005JL6V,"I have been watching this 1982 production of ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"" for almost twenty years on videotape, so releasing it on DVD would be greatly appreciated.  The cast features three of the original stars of the 1979 Broadway production: Angela Lansbury in her Tony Award winning role as Mrs. Lovett, Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin, and Ken Jennings as Tobias Ragg.  Well, you can also add to this list Cris Groenendaal and Betsy Joslyn, who play the young lovers Anthony Hope and Johanna, since they were members of the original company.  Len Cariou had been replaced in the title role by George Hearn, who was still two years away from winning the Tony Award for his performance in ""La Cage aux Folles.""  On Broadway Hearn played opposite Dorothy Louden before teaming up with Lansbury for the show's touring company and eventually this Showtime production of the musical.
Stephen Sondheim has said that if people insist on putting ""Sweeney Todd"" into a category it would be black comic operetta, which is as good a way as any of defining its uniqueness.  If you are going to have a barber who slits the throats of his customer team up with a woman who bakes the corpses into meat pies, then black comedy would be the way to go.  But what makes ""Sweeney Todd"" so marvelous is that it mixes the dark comedy with chilling horror.  For the most part the comedy is carried by Lansbury's Mrs. Lovett, starting with ""The Worst Pies in Lond,"" while Hearn's Todd provides the chills, beginning with the hauntingly beautiful ""My Friends,"" sung to his razors.  Of course, it is ""A Little Priest"" that brings these two elements together, but while it is no doubt the show's signature piece it is not the supreme dramatic moment.  That comes right before that glorious end to Act I when Hearn signs ""Epiphany,"" which for me remains the song I would most like to be able to do on Broadway, although I can forget about matching Hearn's tour-de-force performance.
When you consider that the last three songs of Act I are ""Pretty Women,"" ""Epiphany,"" and ""A Little Priest,"" it is difficult to imagine a show having a stronger ending before Intermission.  There is a sense in which Act II does not measure up, but that is become the bloody climax to ""Sweeney Todd"" rests more on action than songs.  I can still remember watching it for the first time, in live performance fortunately, and thinking that they were reaching the point where things were going too far and the tragedy was about to become too complete.  The only real complaint about this video production is that unlike the original cast album or what you are subjected to in live performance, the steam whistle that accompanies each slash across a victim's throat does not make your nervous system explode.",1053820800,149,2780,4.732919254658385
1461348,5,B00005JL6V,"I first saw this on VHS in the 1990s, and was hooked the first time.  The story is oddly fascinating, like watching an accident.  The topic is horrible, but the play shows the humanity of the characters and the reasons behind the problems.  I know I'm watching something abouto an awful topic, but I just can't look away.
The subplot involving Sweeney's daughter is another hook.
Of course, Angela Lansbury is wonderful, as always.  George Hearn, less well known, is a wonderfully dark bass singer, and catches the character as the demented character obsessed with revenge that he is, or was.  The scene where he goes over the edge is frightening, because there are no special effects to highlight it, just the music and lighting.
The songs pull the show along, and the score place the tenor and bass in amazing twists.

1461352,5,B00005JL6V,"The LA production that was filmed is electrifying, the performances staggering and the set mind-boggling.  George Hearn is frightening, thunderous, and passionate in the role.  Angela Lansbury is deliciously devious, and delectably unscrupulous, and gives comedy relief to an otherwise horrific subject matter.  I've never seen Len Cariou play the role, but he's on the original cast CD.  Hearn plays Todd with explosive, raging anger, while Cariou sounds like his Todd is more seething and brooding.  Cariou is a lava flow compared to Hearn's volcano.  Both are effective, but I prefer Hearn's Todd and would give an arm to have the 1982 performance on DVD.  Not my arm, of course.",1017446400,43,682,5.1454545454545455

7939392,5,B00005JL6V,"This was good. More gruesome in a sophisticated, classy way than the Johnny Depp version of Sweeney Todd ( which I loved) It is a great classic  and cant be beat. Angela Lansbury  does a great job even with her weird singing and the love story between Sweeney Todd and Angela Lansbury is  subtle and engrossing.",1515715200,,311,4.517857142857143

As an educator, I prefer showing the originals to my students over Hollywood reproductions.  This was exactly what I was looking for.",1513123200,,402,4.714285714285714
