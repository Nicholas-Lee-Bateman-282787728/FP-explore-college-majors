The brilliant Jack Gilford exhibiting the rubber face that he rarely showed.  Most episodes included a piece of original animation.  Early in one episode, you see Gilford making faces into a mirror.  Later in the episode is a clip where a camel makes the same faces.
The show was a chance to see Jay Tarses -- most famous as a director -- in front of the camera.  And the ultimate opposite screwballs Theresa Ganzel and Julie Payne -- perfect foils, since naive and dippy Ganzel, as wife of the deceased, is now Duck Factory's sole owner.
I'm also sorry it lasted only 13 episodes.  I just wish someone would put those 13 episodes onto disks so we could see them again.",1434153600,,839,4.516556291390729

There's a reason of course this show didn't last all that long, but it IS fun. For me, the special treat (& the reason I ordered it) was to see the great Jack Gilford. TALK about projecting SWEET! He has it hands down....I guess that's why years earlier he was cast as SIMON THE LIKEABLE in 2 episodes of GET SMART. :)",1374192000,,438,4.226190476190476

 Carrey is an eager animator who arrives to the duck factory in hollywood to meet legendary Buddy Winkler for a job interview. Winkler is creator and owner of Dippy Duck and the Duck Factory respectively. Upon arrival, he finds that Winkler has passed away. With his would be-employer deceased, he has no one to turn to.  With Winkler dead, the Duck Factory is about to go under, and disband. With Carrey's optimistic and loveable personality he gains the other employees trust, and soon the Duck Factory is up and running once again, and it goes on like this...
If you like Jim Carrey, this is an excellent place to see his acting genius. Though he is not slapstick like in the Mask or Ace Ventura, he's by all means still entertaining, in fact, the entire cast here is very entertaining. The personalities are cohesive and work very well with  eachother and their environment, which is, a cartoon studio for a the popular cartoon dippy duck (not a true to life cartoon character). All the actors play off each others humor very well, making each show plenty humorous to watch. From the ditzy mrs. Winkler to the funny voice acting of Wally Wooster (voice of dippy duck and 600 other cartoon characters). Again, if you're looking for more Carrey Mania, or just looking for another decent sitcom, this and the Duck Factory: Final Episodes Tape are worth the ten bucks or cheaper to buy them. I'm only too disappointed the show didn't last more than one season. Enjoy!",1012176000,7,1638,4.680555555555555
