8470949,5,B005G14DHE,"Why isn't this DVD in a format for the US? I saw this show twice when it was in New York several years ago and bought the CD. The music was beautiful as was the show. It is not a ""typical"" clown show but if you want something a little different, something that will make you smile as opposed to laughing out loud then you'd enjoy this. I don't know if Slava is still performing but, if he is, I'd pay to see this same show again.",1473379200,,429,3.942528735632184
