8028428,2,B0002KPID2,"To make a long review short. A guy inherits his Uncles house, but doensnt inherit the money as he spent it all on a stripper/club So Reno has no money to pay for the house, that is when they take in roomies. Some flirting going on between Holly and the male roomate...or so thats how it appears to us.

Toward the end Holly has a 3some with both rommies while Reno is gone, however it didn't make sense, because throughout the film she didn't like nor spent much time with the female Roomie. She arrived to a house party and was furious, she walks into her room and there they both are and as the screen goes black she is heard yelling at them to get out of her room, seconds later shes in bed with them. How does that make sense? I just felt that Reno was too serious throughout the film and seems boring. The film overall was not that entertaining.",1301961600,,850,4.214723926380368
8028429,1,B0002KPID2,"A tedious mixture of puerile efforts at humour with romantic relationship melodrama fails to provide this weakly made film with any flavour of reality.  As action opens, Reno (A.J. Buckley) enters his apartment, there discovering his girlfriend in flagrante delicto with his roommate, who gloatingly tells Reno ""Well, at least it's with someone you know"", resulting in Reno's decision to never have another roommate, this decision told to viewers by means of a soon abandoned voiceover.  The storyline then proceeds ten months where we find that Reno is indeed true to his word concerning avoidance of roommates, although this appears to beg the question due to his garnering of a live-in lover, Holly (Holly Fields), with whom he has generated marital plans.  The plot briefly shifts to a sleazy Hollywood strip club, wherein Reno's Uncle Charley, enamoured of a ""dancer"" whom he finds eminently desirable, keels over dead atop the club's bar after seeing the unadorned charms displayed by the object of his affections.  It is apparent that Charley had been aware of the flawed condition of his heart, because he created a video tape during which his commentary bequeaths his large (and mortgaged) residence in Hollywood to Reno, and we see the latter deciding to, contrary to his vow, interview applicants for two roommates as tenants, with he and Holly sharing the selection process in an organized manner.  Following an inane sequence involving bizarre renter candidates, all of whom Reno and Holly unsurprisingly find unsuitable for living along with them in their house  they, unknown to each other, each select a renter of the opposite sex, with the lovers manifestly cool toward the choice of their partner.  The newcomers (Chad and Nicole) would seem to have little discernible point to their existence other than highly aural fornication with a broad range of partners, and it is not long before jealousy mars the harmonic relationship of Reno and Holly.  Reno is bent upon patenting and merchandising a type of sporting travel bag and, as he has given an engagement ring to Holly, the potential success of this entrepreneurial adventure is of great financial significance if he intends to advance his marital plan.  Unfortunately, the rapacious team of Chad and Nicole, whose every action is ostensibly laced with lust, is likely to disrupt any future wedding intentions of Reno.  Direction is slack, plainly far from fulfilling basic needs of the players, although an erratically composed script provides scant material with which actors may work, and ad libbing falls embarassingly flat.  As a result, the performances are undistinguished, not aided by spotty editing, while the manner of camerawork changes as abruptly and often as a firefly's tail light.  Filmed with a low budget and on location, only a modicum of skill is required for the designing processes, but a larger measure of value might have been placed upon the tasteless D.J. background soundtrack, generally blaring and nearly always invasive.  A good deal of discussion has been stimulated by the movie's final sequences that are apparently not expected by a viewer based upon what has come before, but in reality these comprise probably the only thoughtful portions of a poorly cobbled screenplay, and bids fair to make the work almost watchable, despite the shabby quality of the production as a whole.",1160784000,3,3385,5.155109489051095
