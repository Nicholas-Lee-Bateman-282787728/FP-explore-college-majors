The project was obviously well researched. For  audiences familiar with or new to TCM, the DVD  will provide many insights.
I enjoyed this DVD and will share with others.

8405986,5,0978807499,"If you are looking for a truly inspirational film to get an overview of how the natural healing of the Chinese traditional medicine works -- acupuncture, herbs and food, this is the DVD for you.  If you have an unknown illness that cannot be healed by Western medicine, this is the DVD for you.  Or if you are just curious about what an alternative medicine can do for you, this is the DVD for you.  In it you will find the answer to the secrets of natural healing that lie in the strive for harmony within oneself, with our surroundings and the world at large.  Highly recommend!",1388016000,2,580,4.392523364485982
