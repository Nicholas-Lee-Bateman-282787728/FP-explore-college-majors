8594049,5,B00DJYKAFE,"When first watching Sukey's Circle Volume 3 DVD I noticed it has a 1970's vibe that I adore! All the content throughout the videos are handmade and you can there is a childlike imagination to how it was created.  This makes it easy for young children to understand and absorb.  Most children's shows today have lost a certain magic they used to have because they are over stimulating to the senses.  Sukeys Circle contains incredible songs, animations and puppets.  It is everything a children's show should be.
I am impressed with Sukey Molloy's camera presence.  She is very playful and has a voice that can suck you into her world within seconds.  As an adult viewer I was taken back in time to my childhood years and I couldn't help but smile and giggle watching her.  My favorite video is ""Twinkle Little Star"" a about a curious little star and his great grandfather star.
I definitely recommend anyone with kids go out and buy this DVD.  Sukey Molloy truly understands how to stimulate the minds of little boys and girls. Go out and get it!",1377475200,,1046,4.616216216216216
8594050,5,B00DJYKAFE,"I was introduced to Sukey's Circle by my 18 month old daughter squealing with delight any time a mini segment appeared on the BabyFirst television channel.  My daughter loves the soothing nature of each of the segments and the inviting ease at which each topic flows.  The length of each mini-show is ideal and keeps my daughter happily engaged from one mini-show to the next.  I found myself really appreciating Sukey's deliberate movements and thoughtful performances which illustrate her professional dance experience and studies in developmental movement.  We're looking forward to pre-ordering the next dvd of mini-shows the moment it becomes available.

8594051,5,B00DJYKAFE,"This is great for babies/toddlers.  There are ""mini"" episodes which feature Sukey and her cast of characters (Sunny, Tick Toc).  Sukey's voice and songs are friendly, engaging, and gentle and she is such a warm presence that my children always respond by singing along with her!  I love how interactive these videos are and highly recommend these to families with small children.",1376784000,,379,5.080645161290323

8594054,5,B00DJYKAFE,"It's great to find videos appropriate for my youngest child.  He can watch these and be entertained, or we can watch and do the activities together.  All of the songs have a familiar sound, which will help kids enjoy them - even if they haven't heard them before.  Thanks Sukey!",1375747200,,278,4.52
8594055,4,B00DJYKAFE,"I didn't let my kids watch TV when they were babies because I read and heard so many worrisome stories about what will happen if you let your child watch TV before the age of two. However, I think if I'd seen Sukey's Circle with Sukey Molloy, I definitely wouldn't have listened to those ""experts!""

Lucky for me, I now have this DVD for number three that is on his way!

These episodes are each super short at under five minutes each so attention span isn't even an issue. The bright colors, fun music and Sukey's soothing voice will draw your baby in and captivate them! Even my three year old who sat down to watch this with me was mesmerized by it.

Since it is supposed to be educational for babies, all of the elements put into the shows are to teach. I also like that they encourage movement, reasoning and problem solving skills at a level for babies to understand and be able to follow.

While watching, I could see things that I have read are good for babies coming to life right before my eyes. Obviously much research was done on educating babies when creating these shows. It creates an environment of peace, calm and teaching.

I am so happy to have Sukey's Circle to show my newest little one when he arrives that I know will be safe and educational for him.",1375228800,,1273,4.377118644067797
