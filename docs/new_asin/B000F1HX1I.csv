2548053,5,B000F1HX1I,"I was interested in incorporating yoga into my training routine, and this program was recommended by a friend. It was exactly what I expected, and after three weeks of use, I can see that I am getting the desired results (greater flexibility, core strength, body control).

Some of the routine was difficult for me at first, and some parts of the routine remain challenging even as I have progressed. The jacket recommends watching the entire video at least once before participating, and I would say that is good advice - when you are working out, it allows you to concentrate on the verbal cues without constantly interrupting the movement/position to look at the tape.",1175731200,19,671,4.885964912280702
2548054,5,B000F1HX1I,This is one of the best Power Yoga DVDs I've seen.,1167782400,4,50,3.6363636363636362
2548055,3,B000F1HX1I,"This is an okay workout but definately nothing serious for Athletes, as advertised. It is a regular yoga class.  Over priced, for what it is.",1165190400,4,141,4.64
2548056,4,B000F1HX1I,"Overall, this is a great, no nonsense yoga video. As it claims, it is about the poses themselves, and not about any philosophies about yoga in general. I do miss Triangle and Revolved Triangle which are not in the video, but it includes most of the other poses I am used to doing, and is a good workout that is a length that most people can accomplish with a bit of yoga experience. I like it and have incorporated it into my regimine as a straight-forward, solid yoga workout.",1165190400,6,477,4.370786516853933
2548057,5,B000F1HX1I,"I've been hearing about this program for some time but was never into the idea of yoga.  Everyone kept telling me, you've got to get this DVD because it will change your life.  I have to say that it has.  I am an athlete and since I started using the Yoga for Athletes DVD I have not been injured, I'm better at my sports and feel amazing.  You have to try it.  It will raise your performance to another level.",1160697600,17,410,4.075
2548058,5,B000F1HX1I,"This is the perfect Yoga DVD for anyone who is athletic and wants to increase their strength and flexiblity. Kimberly Fowler instructs in a no-nonsense, intense way that is very informative for the average person.

I feel energized every time I finish the video and my flexibility has increased immensely.",1160438400,6,305,5.1
2548059,5,B000F1HX1I,"Bought for a high school soccer player.  She liked it and found it VERY challenging, but not too challenging that she never wanted to do it again.  Definitely something to work up to.",1392681600,,183,4.515151515151516
2548060,5,B000F1HX1I,I had never done a day of yoga in my life before purchasing this DVD.  I found it really helped my flexibility and performance on the bike and run by just doing the video 2-3 times a week.  And the instructor is very good to show alternatives to newcomers or those not as flexible.,1390435200,,281,4.185185185185185
2548061,5,B000F1HX1I,"I bought this for my son, who is a collegiate baseball player. He likes it very much - says it's a great workout with lots of core work and stretches that are very good for him.",1389312000,,177,3.9444444444444446
2548062,5,B000F1HX1I,"I tried a couple of yoga classes around 10 years ago when I lived in a more populated area and I was too impatient to deal with it. It was definitely a good workout, but being a neurotic, goal-oriented type, it just wasn't for me.

I am recovering currently from a running injury. Everything I read suggested yoga to help with my flexibility and core strength and I don't have any yoga classes available here. So I looked over several DVDs and purchased this one.

I really like this! She keeps the yammering to a minimum and everything is straightforward. She also suggests several modifications for the different postures depending on your experience and flexibility, which I appreciate.

I've looked for her other DVDs and plan to order the other two. I'm a convert!",1378166400,,769,4.723880597014926
2548063,4,B000F1HX1I,"The workout itself is is pretty good, and it's a nice flow. I finish feeling like I got a good yoga workout. I don't know why the marketing, music (lack there of) and philosophy on the box is so ""anti traditional meditative yoga"" because it's very similar to most yoga classes I go to as far as the sequences and poses. Anyway I enjoy doing it.",1374364800,,344,4.2272727272727275
2548064,5,B000F1HX1I,"Fowler's technique is awesome, especially for beginners. I love incorporating yoga into my weekly routine, the perfect compliment to cardio!  While the ""green screen"" can be a bit odd, the video works wonders!",1342742400,,209,5.333333333333333
2548065,5,B000F1HX1I,"Though I admit the benefits of yoga are tremendous, I've always found it to be
a boring process and usually can't wait for a class to be over. I am definitely a novice
when it comes to yoga. I took this class in person a few times because it was recommended by my rowing coach. When I started the class, I was able to meet the strength demands easily, but I was, by far, the least flexible person in the room. After the first class, I felt amazing - as if I'd just had a massage and chiropractic spinal adjustment.

The instructor has a great voice and is very supportive and motivating. I wasn't
embarrassed to be inflexible (e.g. not able to touch the floor when bending forward) and
she explained why many athletes tend to be inflexible in various parts of the body (esp. hips and hamstrings). I bought the DVD and have been using it for a few months now. The workout seems to be very well-balanced. My flexibility has improved tremendously and my upper body, core strength and balance have increased as well. I'm now able to do most of the positions without feeling like a complete idiot (except standing splits - definitely a long
way from that one..). Frankly, I still find yoga a little boring - but this DVD is the best of those I've made myself work through - and the benefits can't be denied!

2548066,4,B000F1HX1I,"I recently moved from Venice, California to North Carolina. I was truly missing my regular visits to YAS. This video was made in the studio where the yoga classes take place and is the exact format of the actual class. It's like having the studio in my home.
Great Workout - simple, effective and easy to follow.",1325721600,,312,4.491228070175438
2548067,3,B000F1HX1I,"As someone who is training to be a runner and has suffered back and knee injuries in my in devour to remain fit into my 40's and beyond, I needed a trainer to help me with my moderate level of yoga training. My P90x Yoga with Tony Horton can be a bit intense at times. I first found Kimberly on a video by exercise TV. She was great and i purchased a downloadable session of Yoga for Runners which was very helpful in opening up my hips, hamstrings quads and lower back. Since i consider myself ,my own athlete, i thought i would gve this DVD a try. The video starts in a strong yoga pose and continues from there. I've always been under the impression to start slow with warm up moves to allow the body to heat up thereby allowing the muscle to become more flexible. This dvd doesn't do that, it jumps right in. I guess she assumes that u did a warm up before starting her DVD. If ur going to buy this DVD make sure u do a warm up before. Other than that she has a calming voice and takes u through the wrkout slow enough that its easy to follow.",1317081600,4,1047,4.06280193236715
2548068,5,B000F1HX1I,"I've tried about 8 or so yoga DVDs and this one is by far the best.  It's a complete workout that's no nonsense.  The pacing is good and moves along.  It might be too fast at first as you are learning it but you can pause it to catch up.  I really like the format because it feels like you are in a class with an instructor and other students.
The poses flow together in a way that makes sense and it covers most all of the basics.  I keep coming back to this workout and will probably trash my other DVDs and just concentrate on this one.  The No OM zone DVD is also good especially for short, targeted workouts.  I hope K. Fowler will make another DVD.
Thanks.",1313366400,,662,4.046153846153846
2548069,4,B000F1HX1I,"I use this DVD quite a bit. I like the workout. The poses/vinyasas she uses are pretty basic, but incorporate stretching and strengthening. It is a complete yoga session. I have one complaint, tho. What is up with the green color that comes over the screen every time the camera focuses on the instructor? I guess it is meant to be hip and edgy, but is mainly annoying and distracting.

Overall, I do recommend this workout. The instruction is precise and accurate. It is a good addition to a training regimen.",1308700800,,510,4.604395604395604
2548070,5,B000F1HX1I,"I just did this workout for the 1st time yesterday.

It is about 55 minutes long.  The last 5 minutes is the resting pose or relaxation,savasanna.

The instruction is done live rather than voiceover.  As one reviewer mentioned at the beginning of the class and for a little bit throughout there is sort of a greenish tint that is used but that didn't bother me too much.  Fowler's voice is very calm and soothing.  As promised on the cover there is no chanting or saying of the sanskrit names.

It starts out with standing poses after the short segment about the beginning on breathing.  I remember warrior 1, 2, crescent lunge, and warrior 3.  There are chatarungas and upward dogs in between.  After these you have some balancing poses and then some restorative poses like pigeon and plow and shoulderstand.  There are some harder poses like standing splits and dead bug and full wheel.  Fowler does give modifications and points out students not doing the harder ones that stay in the original poses she calls out when introducing the moves.

The music is not distracting.  I wish they had a chaper menu because with as well as the poses were organized it looked like they could have easily incorporated this.

Overall a good DVD that I will do again.  I do think it is harder than her No Om shorter workouts.",1304899200,,1312,4.6147186147186146
2548071,3,B000F1HX1I,"I have only had the DVD for two days and watched the first time to see how the work out will be. It looks like it will meet expectations, but there is a huge distraction -- every once in a while, the screen has a goulish green cast to it, and I don't know if this is done on purpose or if there is a defect with the DVD. I tried going to the website to see if I could get some insight, but there doesn't seem to be any way to get in touch with them via email. Is everyone having this green screen experience? Or is my DVD defective?",1286668800,,532,3.8018018018018016

2548073,5,B000F1HX1I,"I have had this video for some time and feel compelled to leave a 5 star review.  I am a runner and have done yoga on and off for about 7 years.  After I moved, the yoga center was too far away and I found this routine to very close to the work out I would get in a Level 1 - 2 class.  If it's a good day, I do it all and if it's not a perfect day, I can step out of a sun salutation; you can make it fit you too. Overall, I know from experience that doing this routine at least once a week helps my flexibility and running.  Kimberly is very positive and helping.  And after doing this video so many time, I almost feel like I should know my ""classmates"".  This is my favorite yoga video and I would buy another one with different arrangements if it existed.",1268870400,,759,3.8645161290322583
2548074,1,B000F1HX1I,"I am extremely offended by the blurbs used on the cover of this DVD: ""No chanting. No granola. No sanskrit."" I consider them to be racial slurs that are disrespectful to the history of yoga and its rich cultural tradition. If someone wants to produce a practice DVD that strips the substance from the form because they think will successfully reach a market niche, the least they could do is come up with a way to advertise their product that is more respectful to the meaningful content they stripped out. I'm returning this DVD without opening it.",1268784000,2,549,4.670103092783505
2548075,5,B000F1HX1I,"If you want a technically sound yoga workout that skips the incense and incanting, you want Fowler's Yoga for Athletes. I've met several elite athletes who use Fowler's workout in their sports conditioning regimens. You can take it easy doing the series, or work up a serious sweat--whichever works for you. The poses are easy to follow, which I appreciate, and they're clearly demonstrated. If you've wanted to try yoga for a while but have been put off by all the preciousness, you're in luck.

2548076,3,B000F1HX1I,"This dvd was far from challenging and way over priced when compared to Bryan Kest's Power Yoga. I purchased one of Bryan Kest's dvds that came with 3 long sessions. Each session is supposed to be progressively more difficult. It took me months to master the first session alone, but I did the best I could each time and was extremely satisfied with my results. This dvd uses many of the same moves and transitions that Bryan Kest uses so I was familiar with her cues; in other words, the lack of description or demostration of a position was not a problem for me. All in all if you are looking for a yoga dvd that will truly challenge your athleticism, this is not it. Try Bryan Kest's power yoga and you will not only get a great deal but a great work out.",1229904000,7,757,4.263888888888889

2548078,5,B000F1HX1I,"This is an awesome yoga practice for all levels!  While it doesn't take you through the advanced poses like headstands, arm balances, etc., the clever sequencing takes you through every pose that your body really needs - just none of the injury prone poses that help us show off!  This practice will keep you safe while focusing on all the muscle groups the athlete particularly needs - basic stretching, hip openers, Warrior I-III, and plenty of pushups if you choose to accept that challenge:-)  If not, you can always do them on your knees.  Kimberly Fowler's voice and pacing are very nice, and her attitude is encouraging and non-judgemental.  While she doesn't try to provide the spiritual guidance running rampant among yoga teachers, she does say that this is a natural bi-product of a yoga practice in her website Q&A.  Personally, I like that she is cool with letting each of us experience our own personal spiritual journey and focuses on guiding us through a very efficient and focused practice.  I use this DVD regularly and can't wait for the next one!  I liked it so much that I also purchased the IPOD download version!",1203379200,14,1135,4.7846153846153845

8116391,4,B000F1HX1I,"I had it in my mind that I was going to do this workout and suddenly become 20 years younger.
First of all, the instruction is good. I consider myself a complete beginner in the world of yoga, but I was a competitive athlete for over 20 years, just not yoga or aerobics.
After hearing friends, my wife, my wife's friends talk about not liking yoga because it's too slow, I thought it would be perfect for me. My goal wasn't really to feel 20 years younger. It was to limber up my body so I could start working out full-time again, including jogging.
This was my experience the first time I tried this DVD, by the fourth movement, I was saying, ""I should have watched this before trying it"". There's nothing overly slow about this workout. I would even say it's more of a mid-paced workout.
It does help though. I was very happy to see the movement on the floor that causes your back to pop. I couldn't remember how to do that.
After a few weeks of trying to keep up, I decided to take the movements that helped me most and just do those. In that sense, this is a very good instructional video. I picked up some knowledge I can do without watching the video.
I rated it a 4 simply because I don't know how realistic the DVD is. I can actually stretch and bend further than my wife, but there were a few moves on here that I couldn't do. Other than that, it helps me to do it twice a week to stay limber. I would still recommend it for athletes and former athletes. It gives a good stretch.",1400025600,,1488,4.188153310104529

8116393,4,B000F1HX1I,I am an avid yogi and former runner.  I find this video a great addition to my home yoga library- not super intense but good workout and very good guidance.  Only negative is odd green film that the video was shot in during some of the video.,1393372800,,242,4.127659574468085
