3135897,5,B0014WQWCI,"This is by far and away much more intense than Mari's ""Accelerated Body Sculpting"" DVD. It's finally a Pilates dvd that makes me sweat!!  If you have never done Pilates, the Accelerated Body Sculpting dvd is nice, as it is slower-paced and shows proper form & technique for every exercise.  But the Burn DVD does go through technique for the most of the exercises, just not all and not as slowly.
I love this Burn DVD b/c there is little down time between each exercise and because I feel like I get a GREAT workout (sweat included) by the end of the 55 minutes!",1411948800,6,562,4.394230769230769
3135898,5,B0014WQWCI,"This is a MUST have for every Mari Winsor fan!  I have purchased almost every Winsor Pilates tape she has.... and this is ""the"" one workout - you will feel! A must have for your collection!",1389571200,6,189,4.25
3135899,4,B0014WQWCI,It is hard! if you are just starting or your body is not prepared I guess this package is a too-much,1388102400,,100,3.8095238095238093
3135900,5,B0014WQWCI,"I had the VHS version of this and it finally broke apart. I love this workout because it's slightly challenging, unlike most of the other pilates workouts I've seen out there.",1368489600,3,175,4.67741935483871
3135901,4,B0014WQWCI,"I am a former dancer who had previous experience with pilates and power yoga.  Usually, I attended pilates classes with live instruction but I was searching for a dvd to do at home and still be as challenged as a class.  This dvd was perfect.  I own three other pilates/power yoga dvds that I alternate, and this one was a great addition.  It was challenging but you don't feel bad(sore) at the end, unless you are returning to the pilates practice.  I would not recommend this advanced workout to pilates beginners and I agree with the warnings that it is best to do it on an empty stomach.",1325376000,15,591,4.435185185185185

3135903,4,B0014WQWCI,Great video.  Extremely challenging workout -- a little slow and I think too long lasting to hold and maintain your attention but the ab exercises are quite challenging.  Would probably have great abs after repeatedly engaging in workout.,1316995200,2,238,5.2368421052631575
3135904,5,B0014WQWCI,"I have been doing pilots for years and usually go to my gym. This workout was great. She works you on many basics and some advanced. I double up on some of the reps to get a harder workout. The music is kind of lame but the instruction is good, not annoying. Good focus on correct form. Really like this advanced workout.",1302912000,10,321,4.193548387096774

8256515,3,B0014WQWCI,"Disclaimer: I'm very active and compete in marathons and have done an Ironman triathlon. I started doing Pilates during my first pregnancy and continued post-partum. While this ""advanced"" version is more challenging than your usual Pilates and I do like it for core strengthening I wouldn't call it a workout. It may be good if you're injured, early or post-pregnant, new to core exercise or follow a no-calorie diet but it's not for athletes.",1482451200,3,443,5.0
8256516,2,B0014WQWCI,"I want to start off by saying, this isn't really for those who are already doing a high powered work out, or for those that do advanced pilates.
This to me was a full video of warm up moves.
This video is good for those who like gentle workouts, maybe ones that aren't so high impact.",1478476800,,284,4.089285714285714
8256517,5,B0014WQWCI,"This is by far her best dvd. I bought it back in 2005 after O had my baby. Great for flatting the tummy. I stop for couple of years and tried it again. It hurt my abs so bad, but little by little I see my body is getting the shape needed and I'm able to do the V shape.",1453680000,,269,3.5
8256518,3,B0014WQWCI,I have several Windsor Pilates dvds & I do the 20 min versions regularly (3-4 days a week). I was looking for a version to really make me sweat & challange my muscles. This DVD did a good job of that because of its legth of time. I will definitely be incorporation this into my weekly routine.,1453420800,,293,4.157894736842105

8256520,4,B0014WQWCI,It is a great workout for your core. My sister told me that my calves are looking a whole lot better. I had to think about that. It must be due to the articulatio,1441843200,,162,3.7941176470588234
