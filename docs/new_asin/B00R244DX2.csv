6897992,5,B00R244DX2,"It's hard to overstate what an incredible, absorbing, emotional documentary this is.  I'd heard about it for years, but never watched it until I got this new Criterion Blu-ray edition.  I popped it in during the final weekend of the NCAA men's championship, appropriately.  I started with the montage of excerpts from Siskel and Ebert's TV show, where they almost single-handedly (or should I say double-thumbs-up-edly) brought this three-hour doc to the attention of the film-going public; Gene and Roger each named this as the best film of 1994.  Then I watched the film itself, and as Siskel and Ebert had promised, it was as riveting as the best fiction/narrative movies I've seen.  It's all ""real life,"" following two young black men from inner-city Chicago over 5 years, as they hope that their street basketball skills will carry them through high school, into college, and hopefully into the NBA.  We see William, Arthur, their families, friends, and coaches in both big and small moments over the 5 years, with remarkable candor, and since we know this isn't scripted, we're in true suspense about what their futures will hold.  (There aren't any outside ""talking heads"" to force sociological or political viewpoints on us -- we just enter into the participants' world and experience it for ourselves.)

I won't say more about what happens, since it's best to simply watch the movie.  But after the movie was over, I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the extra features (as Criterion is famed for), including an extra documentary that catches up with the men and their families (and the filmmakers) ten years later.  I noticed that the Blu-ray had TWO full-length audio commentaries -- one by the three filmmakers and one by Arthur and William -- and at first thought that, much as I'd loved the film, I wouldn't want to sit through all 3 hours again (let alone twice) so soon.  But I started the filmmakers' commentary and it was so fascinating that I couldn't resist listening to the entire thing -- it's so full of insight about their process and evolution as documentary filmmakers over the 5 years they worked on this, from the technical skills to their relationships with the families and how they gradually earned their trust, to their periodic ethical dilemmas about how involved they should be with the participants, to the unexpected surprises when their cameras happened to capture a revealing moment or conversation that they hadn't anticipated.  If you have *any* interest in documentaries, their audio commentary is as essential as the original movie itself.  And then, I plunged ahead into William and Arthur's commentary as well -- it turns out that they were closer friends during the 5 years of filmmaking than the original film captured (since their stories are largely separate, though parallel), and they've stayed friends to this day; they too provide many fascinating and deeply honest insights from their own unique vantage point as the main participants in the film, looking back on the experience a decade later.

I can't recommend this too highly -- it's one of the best movies (documentary or otherwise) I've ever seen, and the two audio commentaries and other extra features make this Criterion package even a richer experience.  It doesn't matter if you care about basketball, or what your race or politics or gender may be.  This three-hour documentary will enthrall, engage, and move you more than almost any Hollywood movie in theatres.",1429488000,9,3479,5.024347826086957

This Blu-Ray edition is good visually -- but the best thing about it is that it includes a lengthy up-date as to what happened to the two boys after HOOP DREAMS appeared.",1523318400,,351,4.816666666666666

8693785,5,B00R244DX2,"I am no rabid fan of basketball, but I love this documentary. Here's why: basketball in ""Hoop Dreams"" is what Hitchcock called the MacGuffin. It's the thing that the film's protagonists are chasing, which is only a pretext for what moviegoers really want to see: namely, how people in a film, whom they have come to care about deeply, react under pressure. The film follows the lives of young black men from poor neighborhoods, behind society's eight ball, are trying, trying, trying to escape its grind on their souls and the souls of their families by doing superbly the one thing they can do that a larger American society cares about: play ball. We follow their lives over months and years, their stories entwined with those of their families: we feel for them, rejoice with them in small successes, mourn with them in large defeats. The movie is clear-eyed with respect to the kids, their mentors, and their coaches (some of whom are dedicated to their kids; others who, over time, have themselves become worn out by the sausage-grinder of their own lives). The movie never condescends, never patronizes, never condemns, never plays for cheap sentiment. There are no heroes here. There are no villains. This is a human story, or collection of stories, told with honest humanity. In addition to offering us a pristine, remastered version of the film, Criterion spills out its usual cornucopia of extras, which includes a decade-later update of where many of the movie's subjects ended up, as well as the impact that Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel's endorsements of the movie elevated it from a small, obscure indie film to one of the critically recognized best films of 1994. Even if you care not a whit about high school and professional sports, this is a move worth seeing, because what it's really about is a contemporary American culture that exacts a very high price, not only among young people chasing hoop dreams, but also among the rest of us who collude in their fantasies and, truth be told, chase some fantastical dreams of our own.",1506729600,,2045,4.829059829059829

8693790,5,B00R244DX2,"Not sure there is a reason this needs to be on blu ray.... but I will buy anyway because it is the best sports movie of all time, yes better  than Hoosiers! Its real and its raw...and it covers a span of 5 years I believe, you won't see another documentary like this. Im not even going to go into deep detail about it, you just have to buy it and see it!!! I can remember the first time I saw this movie back in 1997 and it made me want to work harder as a basketball player at the time. If you have any young teens that play, this is a good movie for them, and the book is also good as well. Before these 30 for 30 shorts, there was Hoop Dreams, the BEST SPORTS MOVIE EVER...I promise!",1458950400,,686,3.9
8693791,5,B00R244DX2,"I first saw Hoop Dreams when it  came out years ago. I thought at that time, and still feel now,it's one of the best sport documentaries made.
I know of so many kids who aspire to become professional athletes. This documentary gives the gritty truth of how difficult it is to achieve that dream,even if you do have immense talent.
I brought this specifically for my 13 year-old nephew. He had never heard of it before. He loves basketball and is very talented. He was neglecting his academics however. He seemed not to understand that even though he loves basketball,school work needs to come first.
I watched the documentary along with my nephew. He was mesmerized. At the end, he said he realized it takes more than just talent to ""make it"". It helped him understand the importance of getting a good education.
I highly recommend this documentary for both sport and non-sport fans.",1456099200,3,883,4.733766233766234
