8473500,1,B002GU77L2,"My wife and I are going to St Maarten and I purchased a couple of Fodor books and this video.  The video is not worth the money.

If you are concerned about surfing possibly this DVD may be of value.  If you are visiting the island and looking for a dvd about local culture so that your travel experience is enhanced then spend your money someplace else.  My wife and I kept looking at each other while the video was playing.

It does say it's about surfing. It does say it's about music.  But it also says Dutch and French Cultures.  We waited patiently for it to tell us something interesting about the island and when it seemed to prematurely end without doing so we both looked at each other and starting laughing.

There is no ""exploration of Dutch and French Cultures!""",1301529600,,775,4.408450704225352
