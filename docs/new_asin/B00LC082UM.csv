6479424,5,B00LC082UM,Great new series,1424476800,,16,4.666666666666667
6479425,5,B00LC082UM,"Hard child labor drama of 1833 England depicts the struggles of the lower class that was so often shown in the filmed works of Dame Catherine Cookson. It's quite different than the prime/proper affluent upper class so often used on TV today. This is based on the real Quarry Bank Mill, of NW England, west of Cookson's settings (Quarry Bank Mill buildings are preserved.) During the era activists took the cause of relieving children of harsh work conditions. This Series One of `The MILL' deals with British abolition of slavery and an attempt at a child 10-hour work day. The children age 9-17 faced poor living conditions, advances from male overseers, and severe bodily injury, even death.

The Mill includes top acting stars. Teen orphan Esther (Kerrie Hayes -`Lilies') received a nomination for best actress. Loom mechanic/builder Daniel (Matthew McNulty -`The Paradise' `Lark Rise to Candleford'). Activist Doherty (Aidan McArdle -`Mr Selfridge' `Garrows Law' `Ella Enchanted'). The mill owner son Robert (Jamie Draven); worker supervisor (Kevin McNally -`Pirates of the Caribbean'); Mill owner Samuel (Donald Sumpter -`Game of Thrones'); more.

NO SUBTITLES OR CLOSED CAPTIONING. Shame on BFS and Channel 4. Strong accents create the need for subtitles. I had to stop and replay several times, and I'm constantly watching British TV series. Half a star removed for no subtitles, but the story, sets, acting, and period history is so good, it yet rounds up to 5 stars of dramatic entertainment. Series One is 4 episodes, each 48 minutes. I bought mine used.
There IS a second season, 6 more episodes to eventually get on DVD. Hopefully more after that.
It's as well done as Downton, but darker.",1420243200,49,1701,5.115107913669065

6479428,4,B00LC082UM,"It really gives one an idea of how very difficult life was during that period of time especially for children.  The characters all played an excellent role.  However, there were times when I had some difficulty understanding the accent.  The setting was probably very true to life for that period.  I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys history and British drama.",1418169600,23,368,4.887096774193548
6479429,4,B00LC082UM,I thought this was a very good story about how children were treated in working conditions before there were child protections laws in England.,1414972800,8,143,5.0

6479436,5,B00LC082UM,Loved it! Wish there were more episodes! I found myself fighting for some characters and disgusted with others.,1429056000,4,111,5.222222222222222
6479437,4,B00LC082UM,"Acting was amazing and convincing for this true story of a textiles mill in England. It was a very dark time where children as young as 6 years were employed in the mills, working 12 hours a day. Children were treated badly, were hurt on the job, by extremely dangerous surroundings. Women were raped at anytime, and did not report it because they were afraid of losing their jobs. You have to keep in mind while watching this movie, it was true for the times in 19th century England. It was very difficult to watch such human tragedy and what terrible things we can do to each other for money!!!!!",1428710400,6,598,4.445454545454545
6479438,5,B00LC082UM,Very good series.  I love looking back into history for the socio-economic conditions and how they lived.  Quite realistic.,1428451200,3,123,5.421052631578948

8665081,5,B00LC082UM,Interesting historical movie.  I would have enjoyed going further with the story.,1456876800,,81,5.75
8665082,4,B00LC082UM,"Good, but dark.  Dark.  Not one light moment can I remember.  Prepare yourself for REAL.",1454198400,,88,4.733333333333333
8665083,4,B00LC082UM,"This is dark, both in content and visually. Visually it works because it helps to create a woeful atmosphere. Unfortunately, the audio is hard to hear. The background noise of the mill, the music, and the accents were tough to deal with without subtitles.

The human stories are really interesting - in a horrible way. You can read about sweat shops and child labor, but having a visual really brings the horror close to home. The clash of classes, the justice system, the workhouse is absolutely horrendous - but interesting. The acting and sets are so well done that you don't even notice it. It just draws you in carries you along.

Not sure if there is a season two, but if so, I will be checking it out.",1453248000,,708,4.48062015503876
8665084,2,B00LC082UM,"I would buy this series if it had sub-titles.  We are hard of hearing, as most old folks are, and especially with British films, we cannot understand the actors.",1449878400,6,161,4.551724137931035
