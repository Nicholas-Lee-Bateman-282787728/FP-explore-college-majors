7926985,5,B00004Y7HM,"The dancers have mastered moves you will never see in a classic ballet and  deliver programs of utter delight. Cleverly, they start with traditional ballet/classical composers to which they have added their ingenious spin, then move onto modern dance/James Brown/Aretha Franklin music that will have you bouncing in your seat. I said to my self ""I can move like that""in my dreams. If ""Return"" is on the program, don't miss it. Congrats to founder Arthur Mitchell, whom I first saw dance with the New York City Ballet in the 1950s.",1460160000,,530,4.888888888888889
7926986,5,B00004Y7HM,"Dance Theatre of Harlem, founded by Arthur Mitchell AND George Balanchine, is a first rate ballet company and this dvd offers a nice, varied sample of their large body of work, only a small portion of which is available on video(please see my review for ""Fall River Legend"" for more information on DTH).  ""Troy Game"" and ""The Beloved"" are exquisitely choreographed modern dance pieces and ""John Henry"" is a light hearted folk piece choreographed by Arthur Mitchell and the input of the dancers themselves(this bit of information comes from what cast members have told me).  The DTH dancers are all clasically trained(in those days by Arthur Mitchell and George Balanchine himself) and this is quite evident in their dancing.  This production was done in Denmark and is absolutely first rate in quality, from set design to music.",1094169600,6,828,5.029197080291971
7926987,2,B00004Y7HM,"so, i fully acknowledge the historical importance of this company -- arthur miller did something completely revolutionary in his day, and i give him full props for that, but sometimes i think the quality of the actual choreography for this company is not so impressive(but i think that about alvin ailey too)...  it seems that these two companies rely very heavily on the masterpieces that made them big, but that they don't always continue to make equally challenging work later. this dvd isn't terribly interesting or well-produced, but it is still valuable for its historical content.  i recommend it, but not highly, to those interested in dance history, but i warn you that the work is dated and not very challenging to a more accomplished viewer.",1048636800,3,752,4.9603174603174605
