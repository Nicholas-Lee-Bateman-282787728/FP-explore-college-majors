8014382,5,B0001M3XBU,Simplicity and practicability of Aikido!,1412380800,,40,7.2
8014383,4,B0001M3XBU,"It's easy to tell, very early on, that Bob Koga, the instructor in this video, is exceptionally good at what he's teaching and probably a pretty nice guy to boot.

I have Vol.'s 1, 4 and 5 of this series (still waiting on volumes 2 & 3) and all are very informative. Volume one tends to cover quite a bit of warming up and explanation, but that's not a bad thing at all. But I was pleased to see that the following volumes in the series did not rehash every little detail covered before.

The lessons shown are very practical and are geared towards law enforcement personnel. This series purposely omits all of the ceremony and cultural artistic-ness of traditional Aikido. The techniques shown are stripped-down versions of classical Aikido moves. There is very little here that could be called even remotely ""fancy"". It's all very simple and easy to follow.

The only reason I took a star off is because of the somewhat low production values of the dvds. In my DVR vol. 4 froze/glitched a little, but played fine on my laptop and my 99$ dvd player.

All in all, I'd recommend this series to anyone interested in seeing well taught lessons in what is VERY practical Aiki-do.",1212710400,,1175,4.580952380952381

8014385,4,B0001M3XBU,"This was one of the videos I purchased when I started teaching some police officers martial arts. I bought it based on the reputation Koga had from his Weaponless Self Defense manuals used by police officers on the west coast of the U.S.
This video is very well done and the information contained in here is very practical and useful for those looking for how to apply jujutsu and aikido concepts to practical self defense situations. Koga is a very good teacher and an excellent speaker and this helps this video to rise above many other Black Belt videos.
Vol. 5 has the interesting additions of dealing with things such as groundwork and the practical use of weapons which is not often seen aikido videos. After seeing this video I felt that I would really like to have the experience of participating in one of this man's seminars.
This is a video I have watched quite a few times and have no trouble whatsoever recommending to others.",1082851200,4,939,4.62874251497006
