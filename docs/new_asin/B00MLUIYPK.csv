6588559,4,B00MLUIYPK,"The story is interesting and mysterious. The singing and dancing was good, but too much of it for my taste. People who like musicals probably wouldn't find all of the singing and dancing, boring, as I did. Too much time on religion. If it were an option, I'd probably give it a 3.3 stars.",1427241600,,288,4.351851851851852

6588567,5,B00MLUIYPK,"Fantastic movie; one of those great Yash Raj films that you remember forever. Loved it. I'm sure the other reviews have told more about the story, the superb acting of Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan and the beautiful Aishwarya Rai, the fun of the 3 students Uday Chopra, Jimmy Shurgill and Jugal Hansraj and their love interests, one being the beautiful Shamita Shetty. This is one of those movies you could watch many times over a few years and never get tired of. Bollywood movies like this, (and Yash Raj films are cream of the crop usually), have such a mastery of different ranges of feeling without being stuck too long on one emotion; moving from deep and touching to light and fun or funny to meaningful to mundane, from intense to soft as a breeze..., touching the soul with music, heart and often a deeper message. This one does it so well.",1468022400,,851,4.605263157894737

8672941,3,B00MLUIYPK,"Teacher comes to school. Changes things. Everyone is better at the end.

Not the most original plot, but great actors. I liked it. It's worth seeing. It won't make my list of the best of Bollywood.",1510617600,,197,4.472222222222222

8672945,5,B00MLUIYPK,My favorite SRK move by far! This movie is about a music teacher that is hired in a boys private school. What the headmaster knows is the new teacher was once in love with the head master's late daughter who killed herself because he forbade her to be with boy. The head master does not know this is the same guy. The new teacher is determined to bring love back into the school. You will have to watch to see in detail what transpires! Brings me to tears every time I watch it!,1483056000,,478,4.150537634408602
8672946,5,B00MLUIYPK,I loved this movie. I love Shahrukh's story line. Udit  and Lata did great as the play back singers. Yash Raj Films always produce movies you can watch over and over. Finally the subtitles for song lyrics. They don't do it for all films but did for this. I'm happy,1480896000,,264,4.28
