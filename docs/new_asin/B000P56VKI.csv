The little doggies all appear to be perfectly happy, and none are fighting. But there is abit of overcrowding, as there are 9 pups,, and the cage doesn't look to be very big. I love them all. And the puppy i would like to take home, has a fluffy thick coat, a huskie  tail, and an adorable cute face.  This DVD is fine. And I just know that children will love it too. A background noise, that you may hear two or three times, might  be a person speaking softly to the little puppies, occasionally during filming. It could be the pet shop owner, or maybe one of the film crew. But that won't distract you. I found it nothing at all.  Just enjoy all these delightful little puppies, as they play and romp.",1334620800,,879,4.2395209580838324
8188936,2,B000P56VKI,"Since there's not a good description of this DVD here, I thought I'd say a few words about it.  It consists of a bunch of puppies in a glass box, barking and interacting with each other as puppies do.  I think I counted 7 puppies, of various pedigrees, and it appears that it was filmed at a pet store.  There's also some kind of background noise that is very distracting... not sure what it is.  You are given the option to play some canned electronic music instead of the original soundtrack, which helps.

The write-up on the DVD case states that the purpose of this DVD is to enhance one's mood (or something to that effect).  I'm not sure what that means, exactly... but if you want to spend an hour watching pupppies play in a glass box, this is your kind of DVD.",1221350400,2,769,4.305555555555555
