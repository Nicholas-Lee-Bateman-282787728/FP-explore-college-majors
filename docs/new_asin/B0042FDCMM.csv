Jane, I saw you on Oprah.  You were very inspiring for me (I am 57), and I have new motivation to get healthier.  You are wonderful, and thanks for doing these videos.  They look like something I would actually do!  Love the setting and music.",1288224000,31,303,4.2631578947368425

4250425,5,B0042FDCMM,"Like I said on her Trim and Tone, Jane gets right to it.  There is a separate section to listen to her talk and then you can go into the menu and select what workout you want. Once you select the workout, it's just the workout with no time wasted.  They are not very difficult but they are a good workout.  I'm 59, was extremely active until injuries and am trying to get back to it, these are perfect.  I've tried many others by different people but they just collect dust.  I've been doing these for about a month almost every day, and look forward to it.",1493769600,3,557,4.168224299065421
4250426,5,B0042FDCMM,I like doing Jane Fonda workouts because you know you have done something when you get done. I was not disappointed with this. Jane kicks butt.  I'm 54 and it was a challenge.  I definitely was in my aerobic.,1487980800,,208,4.3076923076923075

Only about 30 mins with stretching.  Works for me but it's pretty easy and not for people who need something a little more hard core.",1485734400,,310,4.703703703703703

4250433,3,B0042FDCMM,"I love Jane Fonda's exercise videos and have worked out with them for many years.  This one, however, is not one that I will be using much.
2 reasons:  First, her movements are not on the beat of the background music - that makes me crazy!  I vacillate between staying with the music OR staying with her.  Many times cannot do both.  And second, her cues to change movements arrive - not before - but at the same time, or after she changes steps.  Disappointed.  But overall, still a Jane Fonda exercise fan.",1485302400,,508,4.397849462365591

4250437,5,B0042FDCMM,I love this walking workout video. It is a gentle walking video that is fun to do and easy on the joints. I think it's better for older exercisers or people who are recuperating from an illness as it is slower paced. Having said that I would definitely recommend this walking workout dvd to anyone who wants to get started on an indoor walking program or the older exerciser who wants to burn fat and have fun.,1482019200,,410,4.337662337662338
4250438,5,B0042FDCMM,I have been exercising with Jane Fonda for most of my life. I enjoyed this workout.,1481328000,,83,4.25
4250439,4,B0042FDCMM,Very much like it - only downfall is the second half is quite similar to the first half but still a good work-out if you do the whole thing!,1480723200,,140,3.8620689655172415
4250440,4,B0042FDCMM,"I got this workout dvd, even though I'd heard it was pretty low impact and some didn't find it super helpful, so I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy it or not.  But I found it quite a workout (though I am young but unfit), and it got me huffing and puffing for sure! I think Jane is very clear about what steps we're doing, and it's easy to follow along. I enjoyed the cool down, and the stretching at the end was really in depth which was good. Overall, it's a good workout if you're not super fit or you need something low impact.",1480464000,,523,4.028846153846154
4250441,5,B0042FDCMM,This is a low key aerobic workout that works well for me right now. You can pick it up or take it easy to suit fitness level. It ends with simple stretches and is very helpful.,1478304000,,176,3.9166666666666665

4250446,5,B0042FDCMM,Love this DVD. You get 2 workouts plus Extra by Jane which is kegal exercises. She is down to earth with explaining this exercise (kegal). I did this walk exercise this morning & did both workouts plus the extra. She is explanatory with these as she is doing them.  This will also be great during the cold winter months when you can't get out to walk outside. This is for any age group. You don't have to keep up with Jane as long as you are still moving. All you need is a chair & towel.,1471219200,3,488,4.083333333333333

4250449,5,B0042FDCMM,Jane Fonda:  Walkout is one of the best walking tapes.  Jane Fonda has made four other exercise DVDs while she was in her seventies. Amazon has the DVDs to sell.  I enjoyed all of them. Great investments!,1467849600,,204,4.45945945945946
4250450,4,B0042FDCMM,"I got this one and the ""Fit and Strong"" routine.  I like the Walkout routine much better.  While it is easy, you can go longer if you wish or kick higher or add weights to your workout.  But just as it is, it is fine for seniors or cancer patients who want to get the metabolism going.  As Jane notes, aerobic exercise is even good for the brain.  There are stretches and lifts, but if you can't do anything you just march in place or do something else that you like.  The video takes you through a 20 min walk that you do in front of the tv with Jane, and it's the equivalent of walking a mile.  There is a 2nd video but it is really just a faster version of the main Walkout.  I kinda wish there were a 3rd one added so that I would have something a bit more challenging to look forward to.
My goal is to lose 1/2 pound per week which is 26 pounds in a year.  After 3 weeks of the walkout I still look forward to doing it and I am a bit ahead of my goal already.  I still eat anything and everything, just 2/3 as much as I used to eat.  Yes I even eat ice cream, but just one scoop per day!  Gotta get extra calcium for the bones, after all!",1466899200,,1143,3.8583690987124464

4250454,5,B0042FDCMM,Love it!! It was easy on my knees and I got my 67 year old mother to start working out. We meet every morning in her living room at 8AM sharp. She even reminds me she likes it so much. Level 2 is just a faster version of 1 with a few changes in moves. Thank you Jane!,1465084800,,267,3.6206896551724137
4250455,5,B0042FDCMM,I have done the walk a kilometer for 4 months now and am now a believer that these exercises are helping me keep limber as I am entering older age. Jane ensures that stretching exercises are done after a session of exercise and this is good and helps us not be hurt. Not many teachers stress stretching after exercise and as you get older that this is necessary.,1464652800,,362,4.338235294117647

4250467,2,B0042FDCMM,"I hate giving this 2 stars because I love the fabulous Jane Fonda - she's gorgeous and talented and I love her!  But this walking DVD is not the best.  I have several walking DVDs that I use and bought this one to add variety to my routines.  It is kind of odd because where most instructors move to counts of 4 or 8, it seemed like Jane was moving to a count of 7 - I had a hard time adjusting to this concept.  She didn't cue very well.  It was kind of slow for me - maybe because I have been doing walking DVDs for a very long time to keep in shape.  HOWEVER, she does give very good information as she is walking...pieces of information that I have not heard on any of my other walking instructed workouts...I just wanted to be honest - you may like it...but it's not really for me.",1456876800,2,786,4.006410256410256

I love how the workout is only 20 minutes or so, because between my baby and my job it's hard to find much time to workout.  I love how Jane explains what aerobic means, and explains the different ways working out benefits your body as you work out.  I love how she explains things because it motivates me to want to work out more.  This work out is so good that my dad (who use to hate Jane Fonda) will do it with me and now he loves her.  She is so great at explaining health benefits, that he forgot all about his politics. He also loves her yoga video, because as he gets older, he says stretching his muscles is vital to helping relieve his back and shoulder pain.

4250484,5,B0042FDCMM,"Every since I got hooked on :Grace and Frankie"" on Netflix with Jane Fonda, I have just been in love with her and her attitude! This is the very first workout I have ever done with her. I absolutely love her! I  am very overweight (5 foot 3 inches 234 pounds) and had lap surgery performed February 13, 2015. I have lost a total of 34 pounds since December 11, 2014, when I needed to do the pre surgical weight loss myself. I have a bad right knee and found that this work out was challenging enough yet easy enough for me to complete and look forward to again.  I am sweating up a storm! This video has two parts. The second part is more intense,  I will wait and do that after I've lost a little bit more weight as it will be easier on my joints. I love how she talks to you, she talks to you like she is right there with you and is a dear friend. I love Jane's energy and humor so much, I look forward to working out with all her videos as my weight loss progresses with her help. ",1439856000,3,984,3.979695431472081

4250492,4,B0042FDCMM,"Jane Fonda is in her seventies, and she recognized there are many seniors and others who are couch sitters. We need to get up and move, and what better exercise than walking. Jane Fonda started the exercise video craze years ago. Hers were the first on the market before VHS and DVD's had a name. Now, she has released this relatively new one for those in her age bracket and younger.

Anyone who wants to exercise should be able to do a little. If you can walk a few steps, you can start with this video. It is not just moving your legs, but also moving your arms and more if your body as you become stronger. Getting up off of the couch is the first step. Put your arms on the sides of the couch and push up. Here we go, Jane gives us a little info about the impact of exercising on our physical and mental health. She starts us off slowly, and builds the exercise levels up slowly. This is a video for everyone who wants to start to move. It may not be easy at first, but it is a start, and if you keep up with the walking, you will soon be moving along. This is a start and it will improve your psyche if you keep up wit it.

It has two parts: the fist workout was a good way to start getting back in shape, challenging the further you get into it, but not a killer. The second workout is a little tougher and it was a while before I could move on to that one. Jane is kinda funny to listen to; not annoying at all.

I lost one of my remotes in a move and haven't found one to replace it. There's no problem with most dvds. You can advance them manually. But not Jane's!

She is my go-to instructor because first of all she's cute - acting, looking and talking. When I copy some of the cute ways she moves her body, it makes me feel cute too.  She engages you in her life for that small amount of time by the way she talks to you.  She brings you into her space - a space it appears that she has decorated with her Noguchi table, books that make me wonder what she reads, and comfortable looking sofa and chair.  She makes moving interesting and she doesn't take herself too seriously because sometimes she makes fun of herself, and reminds you to laugh and smile. Her routines are low impact, the steps are easy to follow, she sometimes counts to let you know where you are in the exercise. If you are an avid exerciser, pick up one of her dvd's from the 80's or 90's - her original workout or her complete workout- they are probably more suited for you.  If you are a beginner or need a more ""careful"" workout - Jane is perfect for you.

I decided to give this one a try because I really like the walking dvds. I'm way too clutzy to pick up dance moves.  This dvd is similar to Leslie Sansome as far as moves but I found it a little harder to follow because the cues seemed to come at the last minute.  If you do the dvd several times you will probably have no problem following it however.  There are two segments to this dvd, that will take you for a ""mile"" walk each - one for 20 min, the other for 18 min.  The workouts weren't quite as tough as what I personally need but are great for someone just starting out or who needs a good basic workout that isn't too strenuous.  The steps are basic, fairly easy to do, and low impact.

This workout can be done in a pretty small space.

I prefer working out at home as opposed to the gym and don't have a streaming device but I do have a PC and Amazon Prime so I'm able to view Jane's workouts for free and do them while watching my computer monitor in a small space.

Jane gives clear instructions to ensure you workout safely, and reminds the viewer to properly perform the exercise moves, for me this helps me stay focused and not have floppy arms or get lazy. If you have basic knowledge of aerobic moves(I did not), ever did Jane's old workouts you'll be set, if not you can easily see the moves performed, they're very simple and easy to learn.

Jane begins with standing stretches and throughout the workout instructs marching in place, stepping side to side, heel digs, elbow to knee, and that sort of thing. The hardest part for me was the side lunges because they just felt more strenuous AND I juuuust had enough space. If you can't do any moves in the workout Jane reminds you to just march in place. For Jane's second version of the work out there's a mambo style move, the ""pony"", and stuff like that incorporated into some of the moves from the first work out.  For the stretches(the same for both workouts) you will need a chair and a towel, although I don't use the towel.

After doing the work out just a few days in a row I found it easier, it felt quicker, time was flying by. On top of that I was getting the routine memorized and could turn down the volume on the workout and turn up my own music with out screwing up. Jane is cheery but not annoying, helpful with her encouragement and instructions, easy to follow and motivational. Now I perform the entire workout pretty easily but still feel like I've used my body and worked my muscles and burned calories-it's been about 3 weeks!

I've lost & kept off 4 solid lbs since starting the workout.

At this point I do the first 20 minute workout, go into the 18 minute workout and then do the stretches so I'm doing both workouts almost like they're one.
I feel great after I'm finished, energized.

I'm starting to explore Jane's other workouts available on Prime now and will review those when I'm familiar with them.

For now I recommend the Walk Out.

I'm 32, so don't shy away from this workout if you think it's only for senior citizens. This might help you get back into working out or help raise your fitness level so you can move onto other workouts. The music is a little bit corny & dull but it's really fine and when you get use to the workout you can play your own music and keep Jane's instructions low or mute her.",1404691200,3,2797,4.403100775193798

It's so hot outside and with the humidity and thunderstorms, I needed something inside.  I am 62 and needed something for my age.  I'm not in good enough condition for many of those videos out there, but I'm not sedentary either.

As I exercised to this I was pleasantly surprised.  It incorporated many of the moves from a low impact aerobics class I used to take and loved.  I felt the program kept me motivated and moving.  It got me moving and sweating and I loved doing it.  Also Jane Fonda gave good tips and advice and her presentation was good.

Even though  I'm still not a Jane Fonda fan, I did love this video and highly recommend it.

Due to my high risk of additional hip and spinal fractures, I am not supposed to do any movements that cause my spine or hips to twist or any movements that could cause me to  lose my balance and fall.  For those with risk factors similar to my own, this is not a good video for us - no matter how many viewers describe it as low paced.  Don't be misled by those reviews.

I think she has some of the best on the market and I still work out to them.  This is a good, less strenuous workout, and when you're short on time, it gives you what you need.

My only complaint as some others have mentioned is that it's off sync most of the time in both videos.  (Not moving to the beat of the music.)  My guess is that the music may have been dubbed in after the workout, or the editor didn't do a great job.  I have never seen this occur in any of her other videos, so I was surprised that it happened in this one.  Those who are not dancers or musicians may or may not notice it, but for those of us who are used to doing things by the beat, it was a little distracting.

That said, I can still work out if I do the steps to the beat and not keep up with Jane, so it's still a good workout tape.  And for the price, it's not an issue for me.

I would normally rate her tapes/videos a five, but only gave it a four because of the sync issue.",1392163200,,1096,3.8963963963963963

This DVD with 2 levels of walkout is great. Both feel like a stimulating walk and are easy enough to follow by watching so I can do it my way - which is WATCH with the sound off and listen to an audio book while I'm walking. I'm so entertained by the book, the workout is quickly over and I don't resent the loss of time.

The music is not overwhelming. It's nice and smooth and a good pace. Janes patter is smart and fun and she shows a real knowledge of fitness and health.

She looks great and knows her moves and the workout is fast paced and fun. It's not like Leslie's and personally I like that. She's older and she takes precautions that older people simply need to take.

This will give you a terrific workout in a short time. There are two workouts. One a bit more intense.

Highly recommended.

4250618,5,B0042FDCMM,"So this is a little embarrassing, as I know this workout is geared toward seniors, but I really enjoy this DVD. I was diagnosed with lupus about 3 years ago and have joint pain that makes high-impact workouts difficult for me. My favorite form of exercise is just plain walking, but sometimes it's too dark or cold outside to do so. This DVD is a great wayI to get off the couch for people with joint pain or mobility limitations (or for people who are just kinda lazy).

I'm not overweight or particularly out of shape (5'6"", 130 lbs), but this workout certainly gets my heart rate up. It's also fun to hear Jane remind me ""how aerobic exercise prevents Alzheimers"" and that ""anyone can do this--no matter how old you are!"" Love the motivation, Jane.

All in all this is a great, low-impact workout for people of ALL ages who want to start moving but don't want something too intense.",1390953600,2,885,4.490683229813665

This video is like taking a walk, but less boring. I watched it with sound for first few times, and now I turn down the sound and listen to music or an audiobook while walking along with Jane.

You do not have to be in the gym for hrs to lose weight you just need to get your daily 20 -35 mins of workout in 5 days a week.

4250623,5,B0042FDCMM,"Let me preface this by saying that I'm nearly 43, 5 foot 6 inches, and about 35 pounds over where I should be.  I'm strong, but not really fit and flexible, and I prefer working out at home.  After a lot of experimenting, this is my weekly routine:

M,W,F:  I do the Jane Fonda Walk Out--the WHOLE thing.  It takes about 50 minutes, I recommend snug workout pants.  You need to wear running/walking/tennis shoes and have a sturdy chair with no arms available.  By the time I'm done I feel sweaty, but great.  Not sore, but like I've really done my body a favor.

T, TH, Sat:  I do the Trim, Tone & Flex video.  You need some basic hand weights (I'm on only 2 lbs right now,) and a sturdy chair.  Wear shoes.

Sunday morning:  I do the AM part (the first 3 sections) of the Jane Fonda AM/PM Yoga.  It is a great way to begin the day on a Sunday.  You'll need a mat and hand weights.

EVERY evening, before bed:  I do the PM part (the last 2 sections, and often the balance section, which is only 5 minutes.)

I haven't seen a lot of progress on the scale, but I feel amazing.  I can tell the different in my energy level, my posture, and the quality of my sleeping.  I love the fact that I don't leave the morning workouts feeling sore and unmotivated to do them again.  On the contrary, I wake up looking forward to doing them!

The Jillian Michaels workouts are too much for me at this point and I don't like her attitude.  Denise Austin is way too perky for me and I get too sore.  TRY THIS COMBO.  I've been doing it diligently for 9 straight days now and I feel SO much better!",1390176000,,1581,4.118421052631579

4250644,4,B0042FDCMM,"If you are prone to plantar fasciitis, then you know that often getting out of bed and taking the first few steps in the morning can be quite painful.  I found, quite by accident, that the first workout on this dvd eliminated that for me.  I just happened to do it before going to bed one night, and the next morning as I gingerly stood on my foot bracing for the inevitable tightness that causes limping, found it was completely gone!!

Now, I have to note that the second routine does not have the same results for me.  I think it might have to do with the large number of ""heel digs"" that Jane does in the first routine which causes the first routine to be so effective for this particular issue.

I am knocking one star off because this dvd does have severe editing issues.  It is obvious that they taped Jane a few times doing the routines and then cut and pasted what they thought were the best ""takes"".  However, the cutting and pasting was done poorly with oftentimes no transition from one exercise to the other.  Also, Jane's movements are oftentimes not in time to the music, which on occasion drives me nuts, so I have to look away from the screen.  Finally, in the ""extras"" section, when she describes the Kegel exercises and how you should hold for 10 seconds, she then states that if you are just beginning, you may have to hold for 3 MINUTES and build up.  Woah--can you imagine holding for 3 minutes--especially as a beginner!!  Really, how much would it have taken to have a voice over and have her correctly say ""seconds"" instead of ""minutes"".  Fortunately, later in the routine she does state ""seconds"" but by that time she could have scared someone off. ;)

Despite the editing issues, though, this is definitely my go-to dvd if I feel the calf/heel problems starting and to prevent it from progressing to full blown plantar fasciitis.  If you have a severe case to the point you may be using crutches (been there), this wouldn't work as you do need to move around on your feet.",1388620800,3,1999,4.471074380165289
4250645,4,B0042FDCMM,"I actually expected Walking Out to be an exercise video where I actually walked, perhaps viewing scenic videos behind Jane as she talked, encouraged and motivated. What do I know?

She leads the routine in a studio which resembles a home den, very pretty, and because I used her videos when she first began making them, the routine does seem like a low-level version of her old videos.

I do like the video, however. I'm in my 60s, Jane Fonda is in her 70s and she relates very well to her targeted audience. It doesn't overdo it....20 minutes is long enough for beginners--to get us started and keep our interest. I admit I haven't tried the second, longer walkout yet, but intend to when I feel comfortable with the first and ready to tackle the second. I'm very happy I got this video.",1388102400,,788,4.503496503496503

4250655,5,B0042FDCMM,"I love this video! I do it every Sunday with an old lady. The first couple of times, she couldn't make it all the way through the workout, but we kept trying. Now, she does the whole video without taking a break. We originally had to do it with her holding on to the back of a chair, but she's letting go and following the arm movements now. She can now walk without assistance (no cane, walker or physical support from me). She has used a walker or a cane for the past decade, but we leave it at home when we go out now. Her breathing is better, as is her balance, and she doesn't seem as bothered by her arthritis.

I don't think the video does me much good, but I've found it provides a good recovery for me if I do it the day after my toughest workout. Jane is a ray of sunshine with her quips and encouragement.",1384214400,,816,4.037037037037037

4250676,5,B0042FDCMM,"I'm 37 y/old and for the most part I would avoid anything as old school as Jane Fonda.

In the past I've done Shiva Rhea, Kundalini Yoga, Tennis, etc.  But a few auto accidents into my life my body is now telling me my limitations.  I have a neck injury and now some scoliosis in the neck and upper thoracic and lower area.  I am currently dealing with the neck as even real walking, too fast, causes headaches and neck grinding.  So basically I have the body of a 80 y/old:-) Well, I've seen 80 y/olds get around better than me, so a body of a near deceased person:-)

So thank goodness for YouTube because I had a chance to look at many different fitness videos and I had eyed this video and another Jane Fonda workout.  I decided this would be the best for me because:

1) You don't need a lot of room in your home to do this workout.
2) Its a gentle workout but you can break a sweat

PROS:
1) Its a gentle workout- I didn't get much radiating pain from this workout and she doesn't ask you to do crazy stunts (like stand ontop of your head)
2) I LOVE the fact she has you warm up before walking
3) I LOVE the fact she has you stretch as a cool down
4) I think her cuing isn't bad and the steps she has you do aren't complicated in learning
5) There are two sessions, each only 20 minutes of exercise so you can easily do this before going to work.
6) I enjoy the setting of this video
7) Every part of the exercise program does what she says its suppose to do/feel

CONS:
1) Not many cons.  I just wished she had included a 2 mile walking program too.
2) There are some overhead exercises with the arm (and for me, this causes some discomfort).

She does talk a lot, but its nice mindless chatter for me because its during the walking and its important stuff... sometimes she repeats it over and over again... but I don't mind because I found her DVD to be less annoying than many other aerobic or walking DVDs out there.

I am really happy Jane did this DVD... after my recent accident, other than pilates, this DVD is the only other thing I can do without feeling much pain afterwards.  So this DVD is my personal blessing.",1370736000,3,2130,4.150851581508515

4250680,5,B0042FDCMM,"This is a great exercise video for anyone. There are two workouts... beginner and advanced. Each video moves you the equivalent of one mile... in 23 minutes or 18 minutes.

I find the pace is fast and I have to work to keep up with her - but at the end of the walk I feel like I actually did something.

My mother is overweight and has within the last year gone on blood-pressure medication, and at 62 years old is even having trouble getting around sometime (pain in knees/feet). We both knew that losing a few pounds would do wonders for her blood pressure and joints, so she put these DVDs on her Christmas list. Since I lead a busy life but want her to stick with it, I've been doing the DVDs with her when I can to help encourage her. I'm so happy to say that even with not having exercised in decades, she was able to make it through the entire ""level 1"" workout. She was slightly out of breath and sweaty, but wasn't over-doing it. I decided to try the level 2 workout on my own, which is very similar, just faster paced. I found that one to be above a 60 year old's fitness level, but it really depends on the person.

Overall, if someone is older or really out of shape, I think ALL of these Prime Time DVDs are awesome to get you moving again!",1357689600,,1020,4.204081632653061

Jane Fonda is an inspiration for people of all ages, especially for those of us who have passed 40 and lapsed in our fitness regimes for whatever reasons.

As Jane says, it's never to late. Just give this DVD (and others in the series) a try, you won't be sorry. It just takes the will and determination to begin!

I think it's terrific, not too challenging, and I do feel like I've had a good work-out with it. We've been alternating this one with her Fit and Strong, and we like that one too. Mixing it up keeps our routines less boring. Alas, after about 8-10 times playing this DVD it no longer works - on any one of our machines. Not sure what the problem is, but will order another so we can get back to work. Can one accidentally erase a DVD?

When I saw that she came out with a new slower way of working out, I knew I had to get them all.  I like her calm voice. She is great at constantly telling you how to keep your form and that if your balance is not good (like mine) that it's o.k. to hold onto something so that you don't fall.  I am doing better with her workouts than I did with a Physical Therapist that I was paying $40.00 per 1 hour session 3 times a week.  I can finally move without completely feeling crippled. I love, love, love Jane Fonda and only hope I look as good as her at her age.  I used to look like that before my accident and know that she will get me back to that shape!  She's great!

What I like about each program is that it is exactly the challenge I need and both DVDs come with two exercise levels. Right now the lower ones are perfect for me.

4250738,4,B0042FDCMM,"Even though this work-out is targeted toward seniors, I write this review to let you know that I am NOT a senior and not in bad shape. I do the 2 and 3 mile Leslie Sansone work-outs regularly, as well as her 1 mile work-outs during those times when I have less energy. I also do her work-outs for strength training and I've also managed to get through level 1 of Jillian Michael's Shred work-out, although it was tough, I got through it. So I'm not in the best shape, but I do move my body and get my work-outs in. With that said, I could not BELIEVE how much Jane Fonda had me sweating! How is it possible that this 72 year old lady who hardly seems like she is moving, can get me to sweat so much? She begins by warming up with having us stretch our arms, do shoulder rolls, march in place, then we do some old school grapevines, touch steps, heel digs and hamstring curls, with some elbow to knee moves and easy arm moves. At the end, she takes us through a good thorough stretch routine, and it's then that I notice how much I'm sweating! I mean, it's just one mile and yet, when it's over, I feel like I've worked-out pretty darn good! I feel a little embarrassed that this senior citizen work-out has this affect on me, but it does. She had me seriously sweating. Jane does her job. I recommend that some younger people give it a try. I'd like to hear what they think. Exercise is exercise and ultimately, Jane Fonda rocked it!

They were great workouts and in the 1980's I continued to enjoy her workouts and they certainly delivered the results. The Walk Out workout is quite a change from Jane's old style in that it is fairly gentle and seems almost too easy.  I enjoyed both the workouts on this DVD though they were very similar and the time flew by and I felt really good after both workouts.  Jane looks sensational as ever and is so inspiring.  So many other exercize dvd's have such cheesy presenters but Jane is always natural and intelligent and no matter how many times you do her workouts you never get bored.,1315699200,6,729,4.541984732824427

I lost weight and inches doing the workout every day.  Bless her heart, now in her 70's, she has produced another workout for us older gals.  Just as her earlier workouts, the Walk Out is a challenge to follow until you get familiar with the routine,but once you have it down pat you will be able to keep up to speed with her and be just as happy as she is to reach the cool down segment.  I have bad knees and her workout doesn't give me any problems until the very end in the cool down segment when there is leg bending to stretch the muscles.  I do not do those.  I viewed the second workout and the walking workout is more intense but is only 18 minutes.  It will be a while before I join her in the 2nd workout.  Her workouts are informative yet offer a bit of humor.

4250743,5,B0042FDCMM,"Two great things happened for me this past year.

First, I discovered the books Seasoned Romance, Dr. Ruth's Sex at 50, and Grandpa Does Grandma, each of which helped me realize (to a larger extent than ever before) that seniors could still be excited about sex and romance. One of the main common threads running through each of SR's extraordinary chapter/story, I noticed especially, was the importance of exercise and fitness as a prerequisite to great lovemaking. Needless to say, that got my attention.

Which leads me to number two: I discovered several great exercise DVDs and books specifically for seniors, including the newest DVDs by Jane Fonda. These Prime Time DVDs are obviously for seniors, but you can go from beginning to more advanced.

More than ever, I've become such a cheerleader for seniors to (1) get back in the romance game and (2) focus on fitness.

Thanks, Jane Fonda, for the great work you are doing for seniors like me!",1312243200,,950,4.845679012345679

To get an excellent 20-minute workout, you don't have to go to the gym, do your hair, leave the house, or worry about how you look or what people will think.  Play the DVD, and 20 minutes later you are done.  If you're really ambitious, do the second, more intense 18-minute workout.

I am crazy busy, and even I can manage to fit 20 minutes of exercise into my day.  Even I can manage 20 minutes of the self-discipline needed to do this workout.  If you're more fit, you can add steps and motion and intensity to the workout.  If it's a day you can barely get out of bed, then you can ratchet down the intensity.  Yes, it can get monotonous, like any exercise routine, but I can stand monotony for 20 minutes.  Since buying the DVD several months ago, it has made a significant contribution to my overall fitness.  I have been doing Jane Fonda's workouts since the 80's, but this one is the winner.",1311897600,6,1052,4.257575757575758

I am impressed because although it is low impact, the more advanced workout in her program is plentiful, especially if you pay attention to her movements, and stay strong.  I've been faithful at staying fit through the years, but in my 60's, my life became hectic for a period of time, and I slacked off a bit, and felt like I needed a new program. After a month of using Walkout, followed about Jane's Prime Time Fitness, I've lost weight and inches, and I can see definition coming back, and I feel great, even sleep better.  For me, it's a far better work out than Curve's roundabout. I like Jane's positive attitude, and her encouragement.  She stresses good posture, which after a few weeks became natural.

Jane explains the reason for all of the moves and why cardio is so important for burning calories.  I feel like I'm taking a walk with an old friend.  No doubt about it -- Jane is a great example of how to age gracefully.  Am still working Level 1 (one mile in 20 minutes), but I finish feeling great -- not exhausted.

4250750,4,B0042FDCMM,"I've been fairly active during my adult life but less so recently.  A heart condition and related issues inspired me to join different exercise groups over time.  As a frequent business traveler, I signed up with one because they had many clubs across the country.  The downside was the hassle of being able to use them. I finally quit in frustration.

I bought this CD at a retail store.  I can't attest to the weight loss potential because I need to continually watch for any weight gain.  However,  the cardiovascular element is very good.  It works for me because it's easy to do, requires no special equipment or clothing, it's relatively short in duration per day and the CD can be played on a computer in a hotel room.  Frankly, I need the discipline of the routine and distraction of something to watch to avoid being totally bored.  I do one of the routines every other day when possible.  It's made a positive difference in my medical assessments.

One downside of the CD in my view is that ""Jane"" (with other similar CD's also)  is that the exercise leader talks to the viewer  at times  as if they are with you and evaluating you.  Some people may think it's cute, I find that to be ridiculous.  There are two routines on this CD for  variety.  Another  downside for me is that the second routine is too similar to the first.  More variation and less trite comments would make this CD even better.

It should be seen as one segment of the journey - and as one gets more fit, you increase to the 2-mile portion, and on to another workout after achieving that successfully.

Yes, timing with the music was a little off at times, but not terribly annoying.  I workout in our ""sick room"" at work and keep the volume rather low, so it wasn't an issue.

I don't know of too many walking workouts that have very good music, partly because it's not as conducive to being able to use ""fun"" music.  But then it's only a 20-minute workout (not counting stretching at the end).

4250757,5,B0042FDCMM,"WALK OUT is a work out that YOU CAN DO. At 63, after back surgery, 2 heart attacks, and other common senior-age issues, this proves to be a DVD that is aerobically sound and very doable for me. It brings out a bit of sweat with little pain. It WILL also work for you. Don't forget the stretching before and after.

I do adjust the movements a tiny bit, as my lateral leg movement is limited, compared to Fonda's, even with her joint replacements that I have not as yet needed. Both of the 2 low-impact routines are using the same movements. The second is a bit quicker, covering a mile in 18 minutes. If you think you need more than that, simply add more movement with the arms, or make the movements bigger, adding more energy requirement, thus more strengthening and weight-loss. If you simply want to maintain health, do this exercise daily.

Jane uses a few of dance movements (vine, mambo, and pony) which I simply adjusted to simple step movements, being somewhat dance-challenged. It changes none of the worthwhile exercise and fast-paced workout. It's over before you realize it. I received a high-five from my doctor for using DVD exercises.

This DVD, a good diet, and regular check-ups leads to a fulfilling life. Being joined by my wife in doing the Jane Fonda Prime Time DVD exercises (including WALK OUT + FIT & STRONG) makes it even better.",1302134400,11,1355,4.614107883817427

I was always naturally slender until the past few years when my hips and feet started aching and I also fell and hurt my knees.  Then I started putting on weight as it became increasingly difficult to move and all the dieting in the world has made no difference. Plodding along on the treadmill only made my feet hurt worse. I have no money and haven't had insurance for surgeries, but I can do the exercises in part one and have actually started losing some weight.  At 60 I am now hopeful that I can feel better again.

First of all, Jane Fonda is no young chick, and she ""gets it."" I loved her 5-minute discussion about getting in touch with our bodies, and the way she continued on this theme during the walks.

I'm not sure WHY I love the things she said, but I did. She kept me encouraged throughout the entire workout, and I was able to do the full 1 mile the very first time!  The music was there, but not intrusive, and she varied the routine enough that the muscles I was using never got tired. I loved the fact that she talked through the stretches too - telling you what you were stretching and why.

I was thrilled that even though it is labeled as a Walk Out video it is something you do inside (since our weather can be quite unpredictable in Colorado).  The first workout is one mile in 20 minutes and since Jane keeps things moving and explaining the importance of the moves as she goes along, the time goes by fast.  I'm anxious to work up to the second workout which will be a bit more strenuous. I much prefer her style of filming alone rather than with a room full of 20-year olds which can be discouraging for us older women.

I would highly recommend this to 50-70 aged people who really want to keep healthy. This DVD contains 2 walking workouts. The first is a slower pace: 1 mile in 20 minutes. The second workout is a bit faster pace for 18 minutes. You can pack a lot of punch in a 20 minute workout with Jane Fonda and that she does. She also does a great stretch afterward, which is something that Leslie Sansone DVDs do not do. I had a bit of trouble following Jane's lead with next moves, but after a few times I got it.

up just fine, although I'm not a real aerobics fan.  I will alternate

In spite of that, I still gave her low-impact video 5 stars because *I* like it so much and IN MY OPINION it's worth the money. (Unfortunately for me it's cheaper here on Amazon than what I paid for it at Wally's.)

I enjoy listening to this still-gorgeous 72-year-old motivate me to get off the couch and do something about alzheimer disease as well as get rid of the cellulite! Jane keeps it interesting the whole time, talking about stuff that happens to your body - like her knee and hip replacements. Her voice is pleasant and friendly.  The stretching segments are great. The music is not monotonously boring but unnoticeable in a good way. The stage set is warm and inviting, like your own living room. The video has two levels, levels 1 and 2. I haven't seen level 2 yet. There's also a bonus segment of Kegel exercises that I also haven't seen. The entire video time is ""approx. 61 minutes.""  All in all, the video delivers. Nothing too strenuous or boring or too long that will just sit on the shelf. It's just right for someone like me who's not in the habit of exercising and needs a basic cardio workout. When it's over, Jane & I are both smiling.

UPDATE 2/6/2013:  I had gallbladder surgery a couple of weeks ago and had mostly gotten out of the habit of exercising again.  Yesterday I was so sore and stiff that in desperation I decided I had to exercise (with surgeon's okay).  I have several DVDs and couldn't make up my mind which one to use.  Jane's won.
