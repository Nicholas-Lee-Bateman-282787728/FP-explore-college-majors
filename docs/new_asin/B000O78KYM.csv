2792176,4,B000O78KYM,"Fox finally comes through with a splendid DVD rendering of this long-hidden gem.  I first saw this film on TV in the sixties as a teenager, and it made me as an actor long to do this play, which I subsequently read.  While the Benny film somewhat streamlines the script, eliminating a few minor plot points and characters, the essence remains, as well as most of the great gags that are as funny today as they were over 100 years ago.  Mysteriously (I gather due to rights issues, as the musical ""Where's Charley?"" vanished as well) this film disappeared from television for decades; I subsequently saw a stage production starring Nicky Henson at the Young Vic in London in 1977, and it reconfirmed what a hilarious vehicle Brandon Thomas's play could be.  I finally achieved my dream of playing the role of Fancourt Babberly in 1992, and it is still the funniest comedy I have ever performed.
So it is with complete delight that I report that ""Charley's Aunt"" with Jack Benny, beautifully transferred to DVD, is every bit as funny as I remember, with a splendid cast (including ""Miracle on 34th Street""'s Edmund Gwenn) supporting Benny in his best farcical role.  A special delight is 30's siren Kay Francis, here bringing a sophisticated sensuality as the ""real"" aunt...this is probably her last great film role.",1184371200,6,1314,4.79646017699115
2792177,3,B000O78KYM,"The movie is funny and worth watching. It does not

2792178,4,B000O78KYM,"One of my fondest memories of my mispent youth was on Summer vacation watching re-runs of ""The Jack Benny Program"" on UHF.  Sight unseen, I eagerly awaited the release of ""Charley's Aunt"" on disc.  The film isn't a comic masterwork but it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half.  Benny, predating Jack Lemmon's work in ""Some Like It Hot"", is a marvel as the English Earl posing as an Oxford classmate's aunt.  His enthusiasm makes the film more than the sum of it's parts.  The film also sports a great supporting cast that includes Richard Haydn, Edmund Gwenn(""Miracle on 34th Street"", and the late great Laird Cregar.  If you need to see Cregar at his best check out the vintage noir ""I Wake Up Screaming"".  Now if they would only issue ""Buck Benny Rides Again"" and ""The Horn Blows at Midnight"".  It also wouldn't hurt if ""The Jack Benny Program saw the light of day on disc.",1182470400,10,878,4.44375
2792179,4,B000O78KYM,"Benny's version of the old play was for years unavailable save for the most hideous transfers. Seen on the screen in revival houses it deserved release, but I can't say it is anything earth-shaking. Of the many versions of this play on film I still lean to the earliest - with Charlie Chaplin's brother in the lead - and a now unavailable televised one with Charles Grodin in one of his best roles as an impossibly funny Lord.
  This Benny version lacks the combustible physical qualities all the best versions exploit. Charley's Aunt is a sensational example of that nearly impossible form to pull off - farce - and as each scene builds in silliness it requires a little abandon. Unfortunately for Jack Benny the concept of reckless abandon is almost an undiscovered country. He does his best, but piling up physical stunts and gags is not his chosen metier. Instead, fans of Benny should run, not walk to try the exquisite Lubitsch film, To Be Or Not To Be, where Benny marvelously creates a fopish conceited Polish actor who defines 'ham'. Set just prior to the German invasion of Poland, and with a thrilling and justly legendary opening piece of theater, a tip-off of many such sleight-of-hands to come, To Be Or Not To Be remains by several light years Benny's greatest film role. Cast against a luminous Carole Lombard, who plays his cheating wife, Benny is matchless in his every scene.
  As for Charley's Aunt: There's no one performance on film of Charley's Aunt deserving classic status. An all star cast combining the very best players in each of the famous roles would be fun to put together. You might start with a striking Jeanette MacDonald doing the role of the 'real' Aunt from Brazil opposite her real life husband Gene Raymond in an early highly abridged tv version with Art Carney doing the honors in the title role.
  But if no film version scales the heights don't despair. This is a wonderful can't miss play to see live - if you get a chance even so-so amateur troupes usually shine.",1181088000,4,2008,4.674220963172805
2792180,4,B000O78KYM,"""Charley's Aunt"" is a famous British play which for many years was the staple offering of every English high school drama class. It is a rollicking farce about undergraduates at Oxford University, one of whom, Jack Benny, disguises himself as another's aunt from Brazil ""where the nuts come from"". The plot is full of romantic misunderstandings all of which resolve themselves for a happy ending. Jack Benny is an improbable English student but it does not matter. This was one of Benny's best films because he is hilarious in drag and all scenes with Edmund Gwenn, the enamoured professor determined to win his hand in marriage, are priceless. The other standout performers are Laird Cregar, at the time in his twenties and easily immitating a man twice his age and Kay Francis, a model of class and sophistication as Charley's real aunt. The film is simply directed, maintaining its stage bound roots. The print is immaculate preserving the crystal clear Fox photography and very bright lighting. Only the accents of some of the players betray that this is an American production, released in 1941.

The DVD is a neat package. It includes a commentary, the best of which speaks of Benny and his career and the worst of which methodically rattles off biographical details about all the players and the people behind the camera. This maybe informative but it becomes tedious and although the commentator has clear diction and enthusiastic delivery, he races the clock to get all the information out. There is also a good short with Benny promoting the film, but cleverly using Tyrone Power and Randolph Scott to promote simultaneous Fox productions. Both actors are more relaxed and personable than they often were on screen. A couple of postcard size lobby cards as well as marketing and on-set stills are included. Finally, some excellent liner notes actually provide a much better summary of the production than the verbose commentary.

The film makes an interesting comparison to an English variation on the play released at about the same time, starring Arthur Askey. I like both versions.",1178755200,28,2094,5.014367816091954

2792268,4,B000O78KYM,"The last version I saw of Charley's Aunt was the Broadway musical Where's Charley in which Ray Bolger and Frank Loessers music
made for a memorable evening of theater. I understand there is a film version that is not now available on disc from commercial sources. It is the original non-musical stage version we have here with the inimitable (and, at one time, much imitated) Jack Benny and a company of first  rate players of the day, including Laird Cregar, Edmund Gwenn and Kay Francis. They give their all to the creaky plot and succeed in making it a pleasant interlude but nothing comparable to what it would have been to an audience which was accustomed to watch Weber and Fields, Smith and Dale, Ed Wynn, W.C, Fields, the Marx Brothers, and many others, for whom physical and verbal comedy were always intermixed in vaudeville and Broadway reviews.  Jack Benny, breaking into the game when verbal gags and subtle bodily gestures were coming into vogue, billed himself as the suave comedian in vaudeville and had perfected the creation of his comic personae in that mode over the nine years of radio which preceded this 1941 film.
Its fun, like an extended skit that Benny, Hope, Gleason, and others would do on early TV, but it doesn't have the zing it could have had with others who were top physical and verbal performers (as were the combined skills of the ultimately- three Marx Brothers.
For me, who never fails to be entertained by Mr. Benny, it was worth watching because it shows him in action during the last years of his making films (ending, as so often portrayed on radio, with The Horn Blows at Midnight, ca. 1944, which was not the horrible failure he made it seem). For others, who may have watched him on TV (he died in 1973), it might have a touch of nostalgia, as well as its intrinsic comedy. For younger audiences, well, it might just hit your funny bone in the right way, but I would not want to predict that as the common experience for members of your age cohort.",1316304000,4,1994,4.598314606741573

I could never picture Jack Benny in this role, and yet he was excellent. As for the DVD itself, the audio is a little weak in places, but the picture is remarkably sharp.

2792286,2,B000O78KYM,"Cross dressing men as women to create comedy is an honorable custom that goes back to the Greeks.  It's success depends a lot on the writing, and a great deal on the acting.  ""Charlie's Aunt"" is an English play dating back to the beginning of the last century, well served by an earlier film version starring Charlie Ruggles, and a memorable stage musical starring the great Ray Bolger.  I hoped for years that the Jack Benny version would be revived at some point, and was delighted when it became available, only to have my dreams shattered by what I should have expected, sly comedy turned into broadly coarse burlesque.  Benny, with the right director, such as Lubitsch, was capable of great comedy, but in this, the effort of pushing the point that Benny was really a butch male and couldn't have a gay bone in his body turned the comedy to coarsness which undermines an otherwise splendid cast, including Kay Francis looking her best and most charming....",1212796800,3,961,4.736526946107785

2792288,5,B000O78KYM,"Jack Benny was a very fine comic actor which we all have seemed to forget--his performance in this is execellent..as are the other players.

2792289,3,B000O78KYM,"The filmmakers rode roughshod over the play, adding dialogue and story elements and eliminating a whole character. The production values don't look that great either, with obvious studio settings. Jack Benny's British accent comes and goes - mostly goes - but he's terrific as the cross-dressing ""aunt"" and the comedy is fine. Fun to spot Richard Haydn, who played the agent in The Sound of Music, here as one of the Oxford undergrads. The DVD also includes a wonderful promotional short with Benny, Tyrone Power and Randolph Scott.",1198281600,5,532,5.056818181818182
2792290,4,B000O78KYM,"On stage and competently done, that ancient wheeze, ""Charley's Aunt,"" can still work its magic, reducing whole audiences to howling laughter.

This version, even though it is more faithful to the original material than most screen adaptations, lacks some of that magic.  It's good.  It's funny.  It could have been better.

The main reason to watch this old and nearly forgotten version of the even older farce is its star, Jack Benny.  The main fault of this version of the old farce is its star, Jack Benny.

""Charley's Aunt"" is a classic farce which practically demands a breakneck pace once Babs climbs into the big, black dress.  Jack Benny was a comedian whose comic persona and shtick depended upon slowing the pace down to outright pauses.  If you are at all familiar with the play, you can't help noticing how often the performer and the role are at odds.

This picture isn't bad, not at all, but it could have been a real classic if it had been cast with a more physical comedian than Benny, one with a swifter internal rhythm--the young Danny Kaye, for instance, or even Harold Lloyd, who was just one year older than Benny and still youthful enough to get away with it.

2792293,5,B000O78KYM,"Jack Benny had a checkered movie career and he himself felt most of his films were tripe, but three stand the test of time for hilarity.  Buck Benny Rides Again (wherein it helps if you know his radio persona and his supporting cast), The Horn Blows At Midnight, and Charlie's Aunt.  I would add a fourth - To Be Or Not To Be - which Mr. Benny himself thought his best work, but he didn't regard it as an out and out comedy.  If you're looking for laughs for the whole family you can't go wrong with Charlie's Aunt.  Jack steps out of his character and into a british fop impersonating a grand lady and plays the role terrifically.  This was forty years before Tootsie, or Mrs. Doubtfire, and while Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams were at the top of their game, they relied heavily on prosthetics and modern fx, while Benny relied simply on that ""look"".  The walk alone is worth the price of admission.  The movie is taken from a stage play that became the standard comedy of it's time for colleges and high school revivals, so it's audience was built in in the Forties.  Largely forgotten now because it had the unfortunate timing to come out the year World War II began it is well worth rediscovering.  You'll laugh.  And you'll laugh again. Then you'll laugh some more. And after all, that's what you're paying for.",1185580800,12,1320,4.485355648535565
2792294,4,B000O78KYM,"This comedy, a typical example of a filmed ""stage"" play from the 1930's, is a funny, fast-paced and entertaining. Although Ray Bolger's musical adaptation would become the definative version a decade later - Bolger's portrayal was a triumph on Broadway and film, this is a great chance to see Jack Benny ""out-of-character"" - there is no hint of the preening, self-absorbed, effeminate, cheapskate that would become his ""character"" for the remainder of his career.  Consistant with the nature and tone of a farce, Benny's performance is manic and energetic - he even engages in some slapstick (which he rarely did once he established his character), and as always, his comic timing is perfect. No one could time a ""pause"" or ""react"" like he could.  He was the master.  This atypical role demonstrates what a fine actor Benny was, and like so many other comedians who developed a trademark comic-persona (W.C. Fields, George Burns, Oliver Hardy, Bob Hope, etc.) showed that he was capable of much more when given a change-of-pace role.  Its interesting to note that despite Benny's well-known comic-persona in radio and television, in movies he usually played characters that were very different that image.  George Burns won a well-deserved Academy Award for his portrayal of Al Lewis in ""The Sunshine Boys,"" but it took much convincing for him to accept the role after his life-long best friend Jack Benny died.  Benny was hired to play opposite Walter Matthau and had even begun rehearsals; it would have been interesting to see how he would have played the part.  Even in the twilight of his career, a time when many stars are content to relax and bask in the glow of triumphs past, Benny was poised to re-create his image and delight his legion of fans by tackling new roles and characters.",1185062400,,1793,4.917218543046357
