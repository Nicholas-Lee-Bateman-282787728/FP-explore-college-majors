8193219,1,B000PSQVO6,Not for USA platform. Why sell DVDs that can't be viewed in the US?,1429228800,,67,3.857142857142857
8193220,5,B000PSQVO6,"This, the original film production of Wallender, is vastly superior to the recent PBS remake. Everyone in it does a superb acting job. And the characters just seem more real and human. This is a no-brainer. Get it. Watch it. Enjoy the hell out of it.

I don't know about these DVDs not playing on U.S. dvd players. I borrowed them from my library and they played fine.",1354665600,2,368,4.411764705882353
8193221,5,B000PSQVO6,Branagh in the UK version is so depressing - you could just shake him by the shoulders. Recommend the Swedish version which is much more team centered and with excellent acting.,1311811200,9,177,4.741935483870968
8193222,5,B000PSQVO6,"I've seen most of the Swedish Wallanders on BBC4 in the UK, and much prefer them to the Branagh version. Branagh's Wallander is much more bombastic and actually very un-Swedish. The original Swedish version is much more restrained and subtle.",1287619200,13,242,5.075
8193223,4,B000PSQVO6,"I found the Swedish Wallander DVDs when browsing Amazon UK for the second season of the Kenneth Branagh version.  The BBC has shown the Swedish programs and many of the reviewers praised them highly.  They recommended purchasing them from Swedish websites for a much cheaper price.  I feared the language difficulties, however, and ended up finding them on an Australian website for a reasonable cost.  If you don't mind subtitles, they are excellent.  I'll discuss the differences I noted from the Branagh programs. The Branagh films are visually stunning.  I think the BBC crews landed in Ystad and were blown away by the landscapes.  The locations are gorgeous and lovingly filmed.  The Swedes probably took their own country more for granted and much of the action is indoors.  The BBC films center strongly on Wallander (Branagh); he's a maverick who often goes off solving crimes by himself.  The Swedish films are more team-centered.  They take place kind of late in the Wallander saga, after his daughter has gone to the police academy and joined her father's team.  She and other regular characters are very much involved in the investigations.",1282003200,17,1153,5.042328042328043
