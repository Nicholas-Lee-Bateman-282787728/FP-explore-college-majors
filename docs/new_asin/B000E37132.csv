2485141,2,B000E37132,"The First Show.. The best of them all had about 6 homes on tour.
I see no reason in getting this DVD because its only 3 homes and the curators/historians and same photos/ Videos are on the first DVD. Just a different host reading the same dialog. Why see the same thing twice?
waste of time. (been there done that)
Its just my opinion
If you haven't seen the first one.
This one is ok...",1257724800,4,387,4.173333333333333

8104736,5,B000E37132,"Having just returned from touring several of these mansions, I found the gift shop charging enormous prices for the exact same thing.  Better price at Amazon!  The DVD is limited because of need to condense to one hour, you still get a nice overview of the mansions.  If you ever visit Newport, it will take at least a half day, or more, to see and experience the tour of the mansion you choose.",1434931200,,395,4.383561643835616
