8449767,5,B004ZGVCKW,"I have to admit, up front, that I'm not a big baseball fan these days. But back in the late 1950s and 60s I was a big fan  (and a huge supporter of the Philadelphia Phillies, my local team). And, even though TV host, and interviewer, Ed Randall has logged over 500 half-hour taped TV interviews with baseball's greatest players over a 15 year period, - under the title Talking Baseball - he was new to me. But, after watching this one 129-minute DVD featuring six 20-minute shows recorded in the 1990s (commercials were deleted), I'm a huge fan of Randall's. He's knowledgeable and personable and makes the interviewee and as well as the viewers feel relaxed and entertained. And he knows how to bring the best out of each player.

Anyone who remembers the ""Golden Age of the Yankees"" in the 1950s will definitely want this DVD. Three of the players are ones EVERYONE knows and probably as well known as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig (who I'm sure Randall would have interviewed if they were still alive!). Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra and Phil Rizzuto are the real gems in this set. (Joe Pepitone, Clete Boyer and Whitey Ford are here too.)

While five of the episodes take place in a TV studio (the show was sponsored by Upper Deck for much of its run) Mantle was recorded at own  Mickey Mantle's Restaurant in New York and there are other customers in the room to distract you. The interview is a remix of two interviews - with mantle wearing a different shirt and the customers missing. They are put together like a jigsaw puzzle and that can be a bit distracting. But it's the interviews that count so no points deducted here.  Rizutto started with the Yankees in 1941 and became their announcer after retirement in 1957. The guy has amazing stories to tell. And Berra - who started with the Yankees in 1946 is - well he's Yogi! No one else is like him!

This is one of a series of 13 DVDs of interviews, grouped by teams. Because players moved from team to team during their career, the producers grouped the interviews by the team with which the player was most associated, and not necessarily the team they were with when the interview was recorded (IF they were still playing.).

There is no sports footage included in the shows. It is just Randall and the player talking. But what great talking! Anyone over 50 will remember the moments discussed. And what super Father's Day gifts these will make. (Did the producer's plan the release date with this in mind? Somehow I think so!)

I usually review entertainment products here and this series of DVDs is definitely entertaining!
