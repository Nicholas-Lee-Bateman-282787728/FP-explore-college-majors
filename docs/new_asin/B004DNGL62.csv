8425730,5,B004DNGL62,"This is a fantastic film. I saw it back in the 80's when it came out. It is a wonderful slice of life in London back in the late 80's. And it contains many of the typical elements of British Film such as class struggle and how that relates to race as well. It has never been released in English to my knowledge so I was excited to see it released in Italy. According to the info above it says there are Italian Subtitles. This is not actually correct. This film is dubbed into Italian and I couldn's get any subtitles to come up at all even though it says on the box it has Italian subtitles. But anyway. I made the erroneous assumtion that since it said there were Italian subtitles that the audio would be in the original English, but I was incorrect so now I have a DVD that I cannot understand. LOL. Oh Well. I wanted to let everyone know. Also if you Speak Italian you get some great extras too such as one speaking about Typical British Films.",1317600000,3,949,4.191256830601093
