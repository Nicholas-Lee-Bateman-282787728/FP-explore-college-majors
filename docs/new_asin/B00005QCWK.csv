1647994,4,B00005QCWK,"Y'know, there's one thing I really love bout getting a new DVD box set to replace its old VHS counterpart, and it's not just the superior picture & sound quality, or relatively superior durability. What I really love is the fact that the digital disc box set takes up only half the shelf space of its VHS predecessor! A good example of this wonderful freeing-up of my video shelf is the first series of `Star Blazers', now on the coveted digital format. I can now fit it and the upcoming `Comet Empire' set in the same space that used to be occupied by my old Series 1 VHS set! Boy, if this trend keeps up, my video shelf will eventually be completely empty! Waitaminit-- that doesn't make any sense, does it...? I mean, The new set's gotta take up some shelf space, right? So how can my video shelf get emptier? Man, do I hate these weird paradoxes...
Anyway, on with the relevant info. I was somewhat disappointed that the picture quality hadn't improved much over that of the VHS format, but at least I don't have to worry about it wearing out after endless playings! The sound quality is somewhat better, but like the video quality, it's not too much of an improvement. Each disc includes a special feature, most of which aren't half-bad. Platter One features an exterior tour of the Argo (Yamato), and backstory text regarding the beginnings of the Earth-Gamilon conflict. Disc 2 features one of the longest sequences excised from the US release of the show: the sinking of the original World War II Yamato. Sadly, it's not really all that new to those who've seen the original `Space Battleship Yamato' movie, where it's featured along with a few other moments that were cut from the US adaptation of the series.
Speaking of bonus scenes, I was rather disappointed that Voyager didn't release this as a `Perfect Collection', where both the original, uncut & unaltered Japanese `Yamato' eppies, and `SB' shows are available in the same presentation. You know, a little something for both the anime purist and the average `Blaze-head. Also, the series could use a great deal of restoration, much like what has been done for the original `Macross' series (known state-side and elsewhere as the first part of `Robotech') in an upcoming DVD release. Perhaps some day...
Platter three includes another Argo tour, this time a deck-by-deck look at the interior. Number four gives the viewer a more in-depth look at the Gamilon Empire, including their history, the main antagonists (along with their Japanese `alias' names), warships, bases of operations, weaponry, etc. Number 5 depicts the fighter craft & equipment used by the Star Force, as well as the various supporting characters seen in the show. Finally, platter six includes a step-by-step map of our heroes' voyage.
Another neat little extra is the viewer's guide booklet that's exclusive to the box set. Included here are the lyrics to both the opening & closing English-language themes, as well the story of the development and evolution of `Yamato' into the present show we know & love. Also present is an interview with show designer Leiji Matsumoto (or Matsumoto Leiji to all you surname-first Nipponophile purists out there). His dialogue includes an amazing revelation that involves a certain space pirate captain who would've made his first appearance in this series, but eventually found his way to anime stardom playing in other Matsumoto-created projects. Then there's the postscript, which gives you a bit of a tease regarding the next `Yamato' mo-pic!
Finally, there's a few weird quasi-errors I discovered that you probably could care less about, but I'm gonna tell you anyway, because I just plain feel like it. The cover art on disc 1 isn't from `Quest For Iscandar', but from the fourth Yamato movie, `Be Forever Yamato'. Also, the background art on each volume comes from the second series, `The Comet Empire'. I guess releasing the first series on digital disc with the proper corresponding illustrations was not a primary concern to the distributors. Actually, I couldn't care less myself; I just felt like ending this review with a gripe. So there!

1648001,5,B00005QCWK,"More than 30 years, when I was attending second and third grade in the suburbs of Philadelphia, I would rush home to watch Star Blazers, an epic space opera featuring a brave crew of adventurers traveling across the universe to save Earth. Having recently watched the entire first season, I find it holds up very well--and certainly much better than your humble reviewer has over the last three decades.

Despite animation which is unimpressive by todays standards, the first season of Star Blazers presents an engaging story which will draw viewers interest. The exciting plot and sweeping story will still appeal to younger viewers. So will the characters. One of the major themes of the series is the maturation of young Derek Wildstar who goes from a brash loudmouth to a responsible commander. Even the supporting cast make an impression. So do the villains, including the rash Lysus and the enigmatic but engaging Desslok.

There are many themes here to be sure: courage, sacrifice, commitment, love. Younger viewers may be troubled by the battle scenes (though there is no gore) and not all of our heroes come back alive. Theres certainly more to the story and its pretty clear that Dessolk is a stand-in for Hitler with Lysus as Rommel and other German commanders. Still, most viewers between the ages of 8-12, perhaps a few older ones, will appreciate this epic series. Some of the scenes and the music have been imprinted in my brain for more than 30 years; its that memorable. Highest recommendation.",1402876800,,1511,4.921568627450981
1648002,5,B00005QCWK,"This has been on my wishlist for a VERY long time.  The price was never in range.  Until now.  I'm glad I have added this to my collection.  I remember the series when it debuted a very long time ago.  This was definitely worth the wait.  The story is excellent and the characters are well done.  I can see where some of the later iterations of anime got some of their plot.  If you like Robotech, you'll like this too.",1393027200,,419,4.15
1648003,5,B00005QCWK,"Watching Star Blazers every morning before school when I was a kid was one of the defining times of my life, as well as my future wife.  To this day she can sing the entire theme song, and has been able to as long as I've known her (a long time).  Star Blazers arrived around the time Star War.  Both influenced me greatly, especially Star Blazer with its episodic storytelling.

The problem with these sets is that they are incredibly overpriced.  It feels like they are being released by Paramount who are notorious for over inflating the price of ALL of the Star Trek series.",1376697600,,578,4.466666666666667
1648004,5,B00005QCWK,"This was ""The Cartoon"" growing up!  We would race home after school to catch this cartoon!  Until one day Channel 5 in NY decicded to take it off the air because it was too realistic for young kids to comprehend.

A great thing to show your kids the kinds of movies we watched when we were younger.

Good clean Sci-Fi fun.",1369526400,6,322,4.229508196721311
1648005,5,B00005QCWK,"I remember watching Starblazers, Force Five and Battle of the planet (which I prefer to Gatchaman)  back to back. It is nice to have American dubbed original out on DVD.  Especially since when the animated movies that came later to VHS only got a subtitled release.  Only the Star Force could travel to Iscandar in 25 episodes and return to Earth in only one.

This series brought back such fond memories of my favorite episodes of series one as well as restored memories of episodes I had long forgotten.  I was both surprise and happy that the bonus area included original Space Battle ship Yamato deleted scenes that never reached the American production of the show.

Having heard some comments on pictures quality of the Comet Empire Series 2 release I'm not sure if the opening credits and some of the episodes scenes of this series one are just old compared to modern animated shows and not digitally re mastered but the picture in the set doesn't seem as sharp as I recall watching it on TV.  If that the case for a non-digital remastered piece of work the quality of the picture of such an old series is wonderful to look at.

The set itself is done with six single disks in their own individual cases inside the box set itself so you don't have to worry about the disks themselves if one opens it up like some sets I've seen. IQ-9 in Starblazers gives the humor R2 did to Star Wars, the trip to Iscandar and the aliens the crew meet along the way makes me think of Star Trek drama and the Argo vs the Gamalions has the drama of the classic World War 2 battle films.

In short I think it well worth the money offered on Amazon for it.",1357948800,5,1643,4.378289473684211

1648007,5,B00005QCWK,"In the late 1970s, this futuristic sci-fi show used to send the kids out to school with the words of its majestic anthem: ""We're ought to outer space, we're leaving mother Earth, to save the human race! Our Star Blazers!""' Later the song warns us: ""If not, in just one year, mother Earth will disappear!"" Such a great series, made with so many epic dreams of space colonization. No wonder it groomed an entire generation of authors and filmmakers who believed that ""Humanity is destined for the stars, not for the dust!"" Really, what other option do we have to save ourselves from a major global disaster, other than space colonization? Do we wait for it to happen and then explore space--when it's too late? These are the questions we used to ask back then after watching this show, when we were more futuristic rather than pessimistic about going into space for the right reasons. Great series, though, squeaky clean for the entire family, and pure fun for everyone who truly loves space-oriented and action-packed sci-fi adventures. Godspeed!",1343001600,,1045,4.876404494382022

1648011,5,B00005QCWK,"I do not claim to have written this review, becuase I so often fail with words it would be a shame. This might be shamed upon, but please dont. this reveiw tells how I felt with the whole series.
This is written by Nyron.
After finishing episode 1 of this series, a deep breath was taken. I was so engrossed that apparently I had forgotten to breathe while I was watching.

After finishing episode 26, I finally exhaled. This series was a rush of nonstop emotion all the way through and never faltered for a second. Everything I said here over a half a year ago holds completely true and I can't flaunt my glowing recommendation for this series enough.

Rainbow is definitely one of the best things Japan has put out in a long time, and not in an ironic ""Oh, Japan!"" flashy comedy/campy/ridiculous way. It's a serious story. So serious that the first episode starts off with a disclaimer about explicit content. Think about that for a second. In a medium like anime where there's blood, tits and who knows that else in so many shows, what are they warning you about? Real stuff, that's what. Unlike Lucy ripping the head off some moe girl in Elfen Lied, Rainbow is constantly presented as a brutal, depressing series where the violent content is required to present the story in a proper way.

But don't be put off because it sounds too depressing or even boring(I don't know how anyone could think this, personally), because Rainbow is also a story of true bro-ship. Like Gungrave before it, Rainbow will be bleak. It will be depressing. But through all that, a heartwarming tale of friendship will shine. A tale that's under the perpetual threat of being crushed by the blackened circumstances around it, and that's what will keep you engrossed.

The animation is terrific, as expected of Madhouse by this point. This includes the great still art that pops in during narrated scenes, as seen by the series' title art to the left. The whole episode, and most likely a good portion of the series was depicted with very few colors other than shades of grey and dark blue. Any bright things on screen are bright things in the eyes of the story, like the sunshine outside or the end of a lit cigarette shared between the beaten characters. This was a very fine touch and does nothing but add to the heavy atmosphere of the series.

The audio and the animation work beautifully in tandem, with the music bringing scenes to life by boosting the dank atmosphere. The opening by Coldrain is especially great, bringing a badass touch to the show. Similarly, the voices are gruff and work very well with the rest of the presentation.

The above was stated after watching episode 1, and now that the series is over I think it's time to address these issues. Firstly, Rainbow finished excellently. It did not, however, cover the entire 22 volumes of story and instead opted to stop around volume 12 or so. This is no reason to not watch the series, as the stopping point they chose was pretty tactfully chosen and very satisfying. When it comes to negativrs, Rainbow suffered from two things at certain points: Pacing and over-emotion. Even if you haven't read the manga, there's a good chance you'll notice that certain parts, mostly in the second half, seem rushed or like they crammed too many chapters into an episode and that makes it seem like the story skips around a little too much. It's not a big deal at all and very rarely detracts from anything, but it's a factor you'll probably notice. One of the bigger factors that may not sit well with some is that the series can come off as a little too over-dramatized or sappy at points. Sometimes the manly guitar solos and power ballads work incredibly well and you'll be clenching your teeth with streaming down your cheeks, and other times it doesn't work too well. That's something that'll vary a lot from person to person though. The final thing that bothered me was that one of the characters never gets an episode or arc devoted to him, which is pretty unsettling considering the other six boys got the spotlight multiple times. That was the main casualty of thelong manga->short anime transition, but what can you do?
In closing, Rainbow's definitely in the top 10, maybe even top 5 shows of the year 2010. Not watching it should be a crime.",1311206400,,4294,4.6286089238845145
1648012,5,B00005QCWK,"I am a Japanese Yamato fan and purchased the American Star Blazers, curious to know how different the 2 versions are.
I found several 'bans' in the American version.

Death ban.
In the Japanese version, Homer's father dies.
General Lysis dies with a suicide attack.
Krypt is shot killed by Leader Desslok right after suggesting reconciliation.
Desslok seemingly dies at the battle of Planet Gamillon (though he was actually alive, and finally dies at the last episode).
Nova once dies, not just sleeping, right after operating Cosmo DNA and later returns to life.

Nude ban.
Nova becomes naked during the space warp to Mars with the mysterious effect of warp.
She wears a virtually transparent pajama when she witness Homer's attempt to swim back to the Earth.

Alcohol ban.
Captain Avatar and Wildstar drink Japanese Sake, not the spring water, when saying goodbye to the solar system.
IQ9 is intoxicated with alcohol, not having hiccup, when destroying the Desslok space mine.

Probably the American broadcasting authority insisted `Do not show our children anything harmful!'
However, it was interesting for me to know these alterations, which reflect the difference of broadcasting culture between U.S. and Japan.

Anyway, Yamato/Star Blazers is a masterpiece, isn't it?",1307404800,15,1274,5.25615763546798
1648013,5,B00005QCWK,"Unlike most of its fans, I discovered Starblazers in the mid-90s on VHS and was totally awestruck. A powerful storyline, great characters, beautiful animation and a magnificent score, it came as no surprise that this show launched fandom in both Japan and the US. They simply don't make anime of this caliber anymore.
Voyager needs to remaster the episodes and clean them up like the recently re-released Japanese DVDs. Better yet, Starblazers belongs on blu ray.",1290556800,,463,5.105263157894737
1648014,5,B00005QCWK,passed this down to my son... he loves it as well as I did.  great story telling with all kinds of twists and turns throught the series,1284940800,,135,4.0
1648015,3,B00005QCWK,"People have to Understand that Voyager Entertainment as a small company charge more for their dvd's and have less money to spend on materials or remastering.  They have done a fine job on what they have had access to.

The video masters look the best they can from the ones they own, and they audio English dub has never sounded cleaner.
They don't have the rights to the uncut japanese audio or video masters.

There was a recent expensive season 1 set in japan for an equivalent of 400 american dollars that Had season 1 remastered from the original negative in an HD telecine and 35mm original masters.  What voyager has are video masters probably a dupe of the master 16mm tv negative reduced from the original 35mm one.  And therefore being several generations removed is not the best quality.

This is the best english version you are going to get or see marketed here in America.  To expect voyager to Have the same resources and money as well as the masters that bandai of japan has is ludicrous.

This is a big if.  But if they did get access to the new telecine from japan they would have to recreate the censored and cut starblazers from scratch like the US release of Voltron.  They also don't have the license to the japanese Show Space Battleship Yamato as it was originally and uncut.

One thing the japan releases do have real Dolby Digital stereo mixes not faux Dolby Digital because voyager could not afford to pay Dolby inc for to slap the name on the box.",1238371200,5,1475,4.507518796992481
1648016,4,B00005QCWK,"This set contains all twenty-six episodes that comprise the first Star Blazers series are included.  It should be noted that there are some errors when it comes to the chapter marks on the DVDs.  However, the messed up chapter marks are the only real complaint I have with this set.

The first disc contains the first five episodes of the series, as well as two bonus features.  The first bonus feature is labeled as ""Planet Earth: 2199 A.D.""  This is a text-only feature that talks about the history of the war between Earth and Gamilon.  However, if you just let a page of the text just sit without clicking on ""Next"" after a pre-determined about of time, the DVD will automatically move you onto the next page, whether you're done reading the first page or not.  Personally, I found that aspect of the feature to be rather frustrating.  The second bonus feature is ""The Argo Inspection Tour.""  This is an external visual inspection, where you can choose what area of the Argo you want to see.  From this menu, you are taken to a page that includes stills from the show and production art related to that section of the ship.

The second disc contains four episodes of the series, as well as four bonus features.  The first feature is a ""Crew Roster.""  This feature includes pictures for the major crew members on the ship, as well as a brief write-up for each character (which includes that character's original name from Space Battleship Yamato).  There is a trailer for the third disc of this set, as well as a splash screen that includes the address for the official Star Blazers website.  The best bonus feature on this disc, however, is the inclusion of a scene cut from the second episode of the series; this scene depicts the sinking of the original battleship Yamato in 1944.

The third disc contains four episodes, as well as one bonus feature.  This feature is labeled as ""Interior Deck Configuration.""  This is similar to ""The Argo Inspection Tour"" on disc one.  However, the interface on this feature is terrible.  For whatever reason, I couldn't choose a particular location to look at, even though it has a menu configuration like the inspection tour.  It would only let me select the Captain's Cabin, and you had to progress from there.  This feature also consisted of stills from the show and production art.

The fourth disc contains four episodes, as well as one bonus feature.  Even though it's only one feature, it's a rather extensive feature.  This bonus feature includes several selections to learn more about the Gamilon Empire: history, personnel, spacefleet, fightercraft, bases, weapons, and mecha.  Each section has text, and is illustrated by production art and stills from the show.

The fifth disc in the set contains four episodes, as well as two bonus features.  The first feature is labeled as ""Equipment of the Star Force.""  This feature includes labeled production art of the various mecha, weapons, and equipment used in the series; in fact, it even includes a film projector.  The second feature is labeled as ""Friends & Enemies.""  This is a gallery of the minor characters, done in the same way as the ""Crew Roster"" on disc two.  However, I thought it was rather interesting that Queen Starsha wasn't included in this feature, since it is due to her that the Star Force goes to Iscandar in the first place.

The final disc in the set contains the final five episodes of the series, as well as one bonus feature.  This is the ""Argo Mission Map.""  It's divided into four sections (three for the trip to Iscandar, and one for the return trip to Earth).  There are dots on the maps for each place the Star Force visited in the series.  If you click on a dot, it shows the date(s) they were there, as well as a write-up for what happened at each place.  The write-up is illustrated with stills from the show.

If you're a fan of Star Blazers and want to get all of the Quest for Iscandar series on DVD, then I would recommend purchasing this set.",1237852800,,3983,4.659971305595409

Pathetic, I really hope the rights to Space Battleship Yamato are purchased by a company that actually knows what it's doing.",1220572800,10,379,5.129032258064516

Minor points that have been brought up by others:

1) The series hasn't been digitally cleaned up.  That would have been nice, but it doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of the program.

2) The episodes don't have the part with Wildstar introducing scenes from the next episode.  It doesn't seem to be that great a loss, but one does wonder why they did it.

1648019,2,B00005QCWK,"I remember being enthralled with this series when it came on TV years ago; it was the one show that my son and I would not miss. We awaited each new installment with great anticipation.

So we decided to purchase this series of discs when they were offered; they (the discs) were expensive, but you know what those good memories are like...well, they sometimes have a way of clouding sound judgement.

And with the result...

What a disappointment; what a bore! Have I changed that much with time? I fail to understand how this series could have, at one time, enamoured me so much. Now, this childish, immature cartoon series, that I once thought was so great, has me shaking my head in disbelief.

One of the other reviewers, seemed to indicate that something had been left out; maybe so, because something seems different. But then, maybe it's me. In any event, a major letdown!  2 Stars...1 Star (because it's the least available) plus 1 Star for the memories.",1195776000,4,963,4.674556213017752

Her day was not complete until she watched Geberal Hospital at 3 and than Star Blazers at 4pm.  She would tell me its like a soap opera for guys but there is something that has me hooked and I think you will like it, she was right.

As I watch at an older age I like it even more, the emotional rollercoaster you are taken on makes me wonder if the producers of another great show 24 watched Star Blazers at some point.

Some of the reviews I have read had great insite into the show and its quality.  The DVDs are not too bad considering that years ago people watched on black and white tvs and sometimes no cable its an improvement.

1648021,3,B00005QCWK,"Star Blazers, ah the memories of rushing home from school in the early 80's to catch the next adventure of the Star Force's journey to Iscandar. Knowing the opening and closing themes word for word and even being able to recite the narrator's form intro at the start of every episode (In the year 2199, Earth is under severe attack from the mysterious planet Gamilon...)

So why only the 3 star review? Voyager Entertainment Inc.'s (VEI) horrible handing of the series they unfortunately have the rights to... When they initially acquired the rights from Kidmark they cleaned up the picture and made it more watchable. That was a good thing, for 1994... But for a 2001 DVD release it's unacceptable... Especially for what they charge.

In 1995 I collected VEI's VHS release of this series in the 13 individual volumes (2 eps per volume). What I didn't like about them (I'll use volume 1 as an example) was that they would use the opening theme, show episode 1, then it would just roll into episode 2, and then the ending theme. Back then VEI also offered a more economical 6 volume box set. In doing so some of the opening recaps were cut as they would string 5 episodes together almost like a movie. Example; volume 1 of the box set would go; opening theme, episode 1,2,3,4,5, ending theme. This six volume VHS box set is important in this review because it is THIS very set that VEI ""shoveled"" onto DVD. Yes, they used the old VHS box set masters for this DVD release. There was actually more on the individually sold 2-episode volumes that they released 12 years ago on VHS! Now, on the DVD it seems like you can choose an individual episode and watch it that way (with opening and ending themes). Nope, if you choose episode 1 it will automatically go to episode 2 without opening and ending themes. The going theme for VEI (other than VHS masters shovelware) seems to be treating each VOLUME (whether it has 2 episodes or 5) as one whole smashed together episode. Now? Each disc is treated the same way, as one episode. Very sloppy and very disappointing.

I would've also liked to have seen the commercial bumpers and the ""Stay tuned for scenes to the next Star Blazers!"" in Derek Wildstar's voice. Not vital but goes with the nostalgia that makes this series so special to us fans. They did this for Robotech and the Transformers. Why not Star Blazers?

The extras are nice but be aware that a lot of the last names for a lot of the characters were made up years after the show was off the air. Names like ""Nova Forrester, Dashell Jordan, Abraham Avatar."" These characters among others never had last names in the series as we saw it on TV years ago. It was just ""Nova, Dash, Captain Avatar, Eager, Conroy, etc."" I'm not bashing the invented names but just be aware that they were made up by fans that did a comic for VEI back in 1995-96. On the deleted scene of the sinking of the original battleship Yamato, the scene that was used here is from the Space Battleship Yamato movie and NOT the TV series which was a longer scene.

I see a lot of reviews saying they would've prefered to have the original Japanese episodes on here as well. I couldn't agree more... But the fact is, VEI only owns the rights to Star Blazers NOT the original Japanese TV series. They have the rights to distribute the Yamato films but not the TV series. The other problem is that Star Blazers was heavily edited for time and violence. The episodes would not be compatible for a dual language track. Our best bet for seeing Yamato TV with English subtitles other than illegal bootlegs is for a domestic anime company like AnimEigo or ADV to get the licensing rights. And for Star Blazers to get the proper remastering it deserves? A good anime company would have to buy it from VEI. Unfortunately I just don't see that happening. They've had the rights for 14 years now and still can't get it right.",1175904000,71,3885,4.520625889046942
1648022,3,B00005QCWK,"I'm giving the set three stars based on how much I enjoyed watching Star Blazers as a kid - being 37 years old, I have a lot of pleasant nostalgia for the show - and NOT on the product itself (box art, bonus features, quality of the discs, etc) because I'm not going to buy THIS set. So why am I even writing a review for something I don't even have?

Every early anime that I know of that was shown in early-80's America is out on DVD now - most notably Gatchaman (edited and packaged as both G-Force & Battle Of The Planets) and Voltron. These old shows have been packaged onto DVD's not only completely unedited, but also with the option to watch the show in Japanese with subtitles - you know, the way it originally was. This gave me the option to not only relive old memories by seeing the English version, but also to hear the REAL voices of the characters, and see how different the dialogue was. While Gatchaman was the biggest surprise, seeing Voltron in Japanese was the biggest trip. Also, these shows cost next-to-nothing at a used DVD store, or even here at Amazon.

So why in the world - HOW in the world - could I possibly pay a HUNDRED dollars for edited English-only early anime? Deleted scenes??? Put the friggin' scenes BACK in the episodes and sell us non-wealthy fans unedited episodes! And there's just NO excuse for not having a Japanese soundtrack - every other anime does except for OLD stuff like Astro Boy, Speed Racer, and Gigantor. (And even Speed Racer has a Spanish track...)

I'd have left all of this alone, and not written this review, if not for that unbelievable price tag. It just seems wrong to me. Hopefully someday there'll be an 'ultimate' version - heck, a LOT of anime releases updated boxsets. 'Complete Collection', 'Ultimate Collection', then 'Anime Legends' collection in a thinpack... maybe, hopefully, someday that will happen for Star Blazers too.",1173830400,13,1897,4.606508875739645
1648023,5,B00005QCWK,"Okay, people, stop griping about the small stuff.  I mean, come on - how many people ""hate"" Star Trek because the Klingons changed foreheads?  It's a cartoon, it's made up, we're called on to suspend our disbelief watching anything, so have a little mercy and forgive a couple mistakes.  If you have so much pride or so little self-esteem that you need to point out a couple production flaws or the transfer rate, well, then your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.

Okay, that being said...

I've always been hooked by a great story.  Epic masterpieces are hard to find, especially on TV, and I was hooked by Starblazers immediately.  Of course, at first you get into the Wave Motion Gun blasting things to bits and all the battles with Desslok and the Gamilons.  I watched it in the mornings when I was a kid, and the last episode was on the first day of school.  We were one of the first families to get a VCR, and I begged my mom to tape the last episode for me.  You can imagine the suspense - a whole school day in (I think) 2nd grade waiting to see if they would save the earth with the Cosmo-DNA, and what happens but my mom taped the wrong channel.  AAAAGGH!  I had to wait a year for it to recycle and you better believe I saw it then.

(spoiler alert - this paragraph) I rewatched the series once I received it (now in my 30's) and realized how genius it really was.  It has everything that good epic stories have to have - great character development, a death of a major character, struggles that really mean something, connections to anyone in the audience - you name it, Starblazers has it.  I related to Wildstar - some things in his actions and his family are awfully familiar.  I can relate to his struggles with not having anyone, and that makes it all the more special when Nova likes him for who he is.  The episode where he doesn't have anyone to talk to at home really hits me; it's also probably when Nova realizes he's more than just a flashy guns-blazing type.  Then you get episodes where the unlikely characters are the hero - IQ-9 protecting Nova on the ""Bees"" episode, Royster (I think that was his name - Sandor's helper) with the Wave Motion Gun idea for firing themselves out of the tube thing, and Nova being willing to give herself to save the ship (and earth) by activating the Cosmo-DNA, to name a few.  That whole scene is as brilliant an example of writing as I've ever encountered, including any literature, TV, movies, etc.  Sandor is forced to watch helplessly, and Wildstar has already tried to be the hero and can do nothing more; Nova does what she has to do and willingly gives herself for the crew and the earth.  Stealing a little from the Bible, there's brilliant ending where Avatar sees earth ""one more time"" as he wished (Moses seeing the promised land but not going in), and, the sacrifice having proven successful, Nova comes out of her coma.  It's such a great way to end the series.

I showed Starblazers to a couple friends who had never seen it; one stayed up all night and watched the whole series, and the other finished it over the course of a week, only because he didn't want to lose his job!  He would come home from work and take over the TV.  This is a man in his late 20s at the time.  Five stars, no question.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll sing along.

1648024,4,B00005QCWK,"I am pleased with the overall presentation. Having the original format gives it the feel of retro-realism. My only complaint is that the portion showing the sinking of the Yamato in WWII is corrupted and chops through the entire clip. The only recording flaw I have detected.

I had recollections of Deslock changing from fair skinned to blue skinned. Watching the episodes verified for me that he changed along with other characters to the unifying blue skin color between episode 10 & 11. No explanation for this change is given though (unless I missed it somewhere).

1648026,5,B00005QCWK,"I only caught a few episodes when Star Blazers, the English-dubbed version of Space Battleship Yamato was syndicated in 1979. But everything about it captivated me: the sound, the style, the characters, the story. Later I tried renting episodes on VHS but the cost was prohibitive. When Star Blazers began to be released on single DVDs, I could finally start collecting and watching the entire series.

The sound, the characters, the style and the story were quintessential anime, but even so Star Blazers stands out and holds up against many later, higher tech series. Like American TV cartoons, Star Blazers was limited animation, full theatrical animation being too expensive for a TV budget. But the studios made different choices. Hanna-Barbera and Filmation cartoons are famous for characters running repeatedly by the same house or barber pole; the action is used for the characters and the backgrounds are still.

But in anime the characters are often still or nearly so, while the backgrounds move. The background often becomes a character, setting the stage and sense. The characters' long motionless takes lend themselves to thinking and emotion. The backgrounds, often beautifully painted, provide atmosphere and depth. Shots are filmed at unique angles and from odd perspectives providing the feel of manga or a graphic novel.

For anyone collecting the series, this set includes the first six DVDs, each in its own case in a boxed set at considerable savings over the single discs. This story arc (Series I, parts I-VI) was known as The Quest for Iscandar.  The second six DVDs (Serries II, Parts I-VI) now make up the boxed set of The Comet Empire. The third story arc (Series III, Parts I-VI) known as The Bolar Wars has been remastered for the boxed set release. Extras on The Quest for Iscandar discs include a tour of the Argo, deleted scenes and crew roster, an overview of the Gamilon empire, friends and enemies and equipment of the Star Force, and an interactive mission map of the trip to Iscandar.

Voyager Entertainment has also released the five Yamato films on five DVDs in a boxed set. Space Battleship Yamato: The Movie retells The Quest for Iscandar as a film; Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato: In the Name of Love retells the Comet Empire; Yamato: The New Voyage centers on a return trip to Iscandar; Be Forever Yamato features the young, Iscandar-era Wildstar; the newest entry to DVD is Final Yamato, also known as Space Battleship Yamato: The Final Battle.

As most viewers know, Yamato in the Japanese originals is the Argo in Star Blazers. As with Gatchaman, which arrived in the US variously as Battle of the Planets and G-Force, Star Blazers was the edited and somewhat rewritten version of Yamato. But now with all five Yamato films and all three Star Blazers series on DVD, both Baby Boomers and Gen-X viewers can relive the entire saga of Our Star Blazers.",1151625600,3,2901,4.934426229508197

This primed my mind for even better stuff; I watched Robotech when it first aired in the U.S. and years later I was lucky enough to watch ""Akira"" (the Holy Grail of Anime for most) at the theatre.

So many memorable scenes ... the farewell parade on Earth/Iscandar's dazzling landscape/Derek and Nova at the end. It's a feast for the heart and mind.

This is it, people, the Starblazers Series One set. It's the ""Quest for Iscandar"" storyline and its just as fun to watch now as it was when you were a kid.
Starblazers was a very popular series when shown in the United States in the 1970's. It's very colorfully drawn and importantly, it has a good story to tell.
Basically, the story is this - Earth is attacked and only has one year until it will be destroyed unless the Star Force can fly to a distant planet (Iscandar) and retrieve the machine necessary to removing deadly radiation.
Its just the kind of stuff you want to worry about when you're a kid watching cartoons, right? That's the wonderful thing about anime. It doesn't write ""down"" to its audience. It's as much adult entertainment as it is for the kids.
And this is a special series, because it also has the coolest opening title song ever - its impossible to get out of your head - and I know you're looking for the lyrics so here you go - sing along with the DVDs.
We're off to outer space, we're leaving Mother Earth
To save the human race. Our Star Blazers.
Searching for a distant star, heading off to Iscandar
Leaving all we love behind, who knows what dangers we'll find?
We must be strong and brave, our home we've got to save.
If we don't, in just one year, Mother Earth will disappear
Fighting with the Gamalons, we won't stop until we've won
Then we'll return, and when we arrive
The Earth will survive with our Star Blazers.
I highly recommend this set. Its a must have for any Anime fan.

1648034,5,B00005QCWK,"10 years ago, I bought the VHS versions of StarBlazers and was very disappointed by the lousy quality of the picture and sound.
With the DVD version, you have a crystal sharp picture. The sound, well you can only do so much with the sound, but for a 70's Anime series it's not bad.
If you spent the afternoons when you were a kid cheering for Wildstar, Nova, Venture, and Captain Avatar, this is a MUST HAVE. If your kids have never seen this, it's high time they were introduced to some real adventure from the land of the rising sun.
The special extras are great. I especially suggest check out disc 2's original trailer and scenes that never showed on US tv.
While the price may seem a bit steep, you will NOT be upset with the product.
And to my old friend Kenny, who gave me a copy of Be Forever Yamato almost 20 years ago, thank you. It is now joined be this wonderful series.",1085875200,7,882,4.255952380952381
1648035,5,B00005QCWK,"Now, for the actual DVDs.  Let's be honest, some of the dated animation is quite frankly, laughable by today's standards...and I love it!  What sets this show apart from all the shows of my youth is the simple fact that it doesn't sound like a kid's show.  There are phrases like ""tachyon particles"" and words like ""antiquated"" in a kid's show?  Not likely.  Also, what propells this show are the absolutely great ideas for any science-fiction adventure story.  George Lucas even took ideas from this series and slightly changed them for the first ""Star Wars Trilogy.""  I noticed just the other episode that the ""Star Force"" salute is identical to the ""Thermian"" salute used in the film ""Galaxy Quest."" Coincidence?  There are also many goofy, yet charming phrases strewn throughout, like: ""dynamic do-all"" and the always intimidating ""ultra-menace missle.""  Some of the characters are also comically evil, like Lord Desslok, who sounds more like a demented Roddy Mcdowall on laughing gas than the leader of the Gamilons.  Again, I love it!  Then there are always the gross miscalculations of the crewmembers: ""We went thousands of light-years in less than a minute!""  Of course, Venture was referring to the distance between the Earth's moon and Mars.  Even as a child I knew better than that!  Anyway, this is a priceless piece of nostalgia for me, and for anyone who grew up loving the this series as a child.  They certainly don't make them like this anymore...and that's too bad.",1077926400,5,1484,4.92741935483871

1648037,5,B00005QCWK,"STAR BLAZERS is not for everyone.  Let's get that straight right away.
STAR BLAZERS, despite all of its drawbacks (let's not dwell on those, OK?) is perhaps the GREATEST cartoon of all time.
I make this assertion solely on the quality of the story and the development of the characters.  In fact, one could retell the STAR BLAZERS story the same way Patrick Stewart performs Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol""  (Mr. Stewart portrays all the characters on an empty stage, using different voices and mannerisms to shift from one character to another) and it would work, at least for a die-hard fan.
I am a life-long (at least since age 7) STAR WARS fan, and since this hit the airwaves around the time of SW's 2nd theatrical release (1979?), it was a marketing miracle of Sandy Frank productions (and maybe a little idea theft...have you noticed the similarity between the WAVE MOTION GUN and the DEATH STAR SUPERLASER?).
If you were not totally blown away by Luke, Darth and the whole SW: ANH bit, you probably were not part of the target audience.
In a world where rabbits and birds dropped huge rocks on dim-witted hunters and varmint-slayers (which is not to say it wasn't entertaining, just the same old joke) STAR BLAZERS stood out as quality animated programming.
Despite the fact it relayed adult subjects, like war and the possible extinction of the human race, in a children's format, it did it well, and it too this day is the ONLY cartoon I ever stayed home to watch (I was a good student, and I rarely missed a day of school if I wasn't ill).
Rumor has it that DISNEY bought the rights to a live action theatrical production, but corona ...has listed that effort as in 'development hell.'
My wildest dream would be to complete and sell to a major studio/director a workable script, retelling, in detail, the first STAR BLAZERS story (The Journey to Iscandar).  Heck, I wouldn't do it for the money, just the visual spectacle.
I'd do the sequels for the money.",1032825600,6,1965,4.670520231213873
1648038,5,B00005QCWK,"I bought these disks with some trepidation.  I was about ten years old when Star Blazers seared across my conciousness.  I loved the show deeply at that time.  I finally decided to go ahead and splurge on the DVD's, nervous that I was wasting my money on a half-remembered show that would no longer be impressive to a 30-year old.
I was wrong.  Wonderfully wrong.
Sure, the animation is crude.  You can actually see marks and debris on the glass plates used for the animation.  Sure, some parts are cheesy.  Sure, some of the violence was mitigated for the American version.  Sure the science varies from wonderfully accurate to ludicrous.  But this is still an amazing series -- one of the best pieces of sci-fi to ever reach the small screen.  I watched the last ten episodes in one night.
In brief, this DVD covers the first season of the Americanized version of the classic Japanese anime series Space Battleship Yamato (itself an expansion of a movie).  Earth is under attack by the mysterious Gamilons, who are bombarding the planet with lethal radiation bombs.  The planet has one year of life left.  But a call from a distant planet in the Magellanic Clouds promises a cure to the radiation and provides them with new technology to make the journey.  The star blazers board the resurrected battleship Yamato (rechristened Argo for the American version) and make a desperate trip to save the human race.
I guess the reason this had such appeal to me as a kid and I still love it is that it never talks down.  The characters develop over 26 episodes into fully realized characters.  Complex plotlines (Wildstar's loss of his family, Avatar's sickeness, Wildstar's and Nova's budding romance) develop gently.  Characters have a realistic chance of being killed (many die).  It turns out the Gamilons have reason of their own for invading Earth -- they're not just evil monsters.  And the finale - a desperate battle in the Magellanic Clouds, the arrival at Iscandar, the return to Earth -- is stunning.
This series combines action with drama.  One particularly good episode shows the crew bidding their last farewells to Earth as they leave the solar system.  Another simply details their homesickness.  These episodes exists side by side with a 3-part battle at Pluto, a massive confrontation halfway along the journey and two awesome battles at the conclusion of the journey.
The DVD's come with plenty of interesting extras -- a history of Gamilon, a tour of the Argo, etc.  But that's gravy.
If you've never seen Star Blazers before, you might want to rent the series or buy one disk before making a big financial commitment.  If, like me, you have vague but happy memories of the show, go ahead and splurge.  You won't be sorry.",1022716800,264,2738,4.78678038379531
1648039,5,B00005QCWK,"If you were being packed off to school on innumerable mornings in the late 70s/early 80s, chances are you woke up extra early some mornings to the rousing tones of the ""Star Blazers"" theme:
""We're off to outer space,
Leaving Mother Earth,
To save the human race
Our Star Blazers!""
The half-hour cartoons which ensued were nothing short of miraculous to kids weaned on Looney Tunes: furiously intense little snippets of a small band of heroes in a tricked-out World War Two battleship in a desperate struggle against evil aliens.
This was no ""G.I. Joe,"" folks---the stakes were high, and people got hurt.  The captain of the Argo spent much of the trip battling radiation poisoning, the heroes were invariably placed in precarious situations and occasionally were lost.  While the Star Force won most of the battles, these victories were dearly bought; many episodes ended with the ship limping along leaving enormous smoke trails in its wake.
Now ""Star Blazers"" has finally arrived on DVD.
I started watching the first episode, and wound up sitting in front of the TV oblivious to everything around me until I watched all 6 DVDs (about 12 hrs in all).  Despite a transfer showing no improvement over the muddy images which danced across my 13"" color screen all those years ago, this series STILL has the power to hook the unwary.
In addition to the 26 first series episodes, the DVD edition also includes a ton of nifty special features providing a wealth of background information.  My particular favorite is the interactive mission map detailing the Argo's entire journey to Iscandar and back with episode-specific summaries of key events.
I've seen a lot of Japanese manga since ""Star Blazers"" first bombarded my eyeballs, but slick production and hard-boiled storylines pale in comparison to the ominous warning at the end of each episode:  ""Hurry, Star Force!  Earth has only 256 days left!""

Watching it again for the first time in nearly twenty years, I found myself still enjoying the story. It's human drama and an epic war story that spans the stars.
So why not a higher rating. Simplicity. These days, I do know what anime is, and I've had opportunity to see the original Space Battleship Yamato that this was translated from.
The deleted scenes are restored as extras on the discs. But the original japanese dialogue is not, and in some places the translation was kiddie-fied to make it more saturday morning friendly here in the U.S.
Still a great series, and a must if you're a fan of Leiji Matsumoto's epic form of storytelling.",1019779200,15,841,4.503267973856209
1648041,4,B00005QCWK,"When ""Star Blazers"" first made it's way onto American television, I am proud to say that I was there to enjoy it during its first run. Every day after school it was a religious part of my routine to tune in the adventures of the Argo and the Star Force (along with ""Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", ""Get Smart"", ""Battle of the Planets"", and other shows in the afternoon sci-fi kid's programming out of Boston).
Star Blazers was an experiment. The idea of having an animated kid's series kind of like a soap opera (with a continuing story arc spread out over many episodes), was entirely new at the time. No one else had tried it. No one knew if it would work. Happily, ""Star Blazers"" was a smash, and an unquestionable success.
Every episode would end with the Star Force either victorious over the new Gamelon commander and his evil plot, or with the Argo teetering on the verge of destruction until the next episode.
One facet of the program I really liked was the running tally of ""days remaining"" before the Earth was no longer habitable. It gave the show some added weight, and each delay or threat the Star Force encountered became that much more deadly, more serious. As a youngster, I too worried like the announcer, ""Will the Star Force be able to reach Iscandar, and get the CosmoDNA in time? And what of the long journey back to Earth? Hurry, Star Force! There are only two-hundred and twenty-four days left [or whatever]!""
The DVD set is nicely packaged, as others here have mentioned. The special features are good, especially the history of Earth and the Gamalons. Although the art (especially the opening credits), seems to be a bit muddy at times, overall the transfers are decent. I did think the menus were a bit clunky, but they serve. One thing that annoyed me was that the episodes are designed to play back-to-back continuously without the credits sequences. You have to select each episode individually to watch it complete with the opening and closings. Between that and the clunky menus, I had to detract one star from my rating.
Certainly one of the more serious animated programs I can remember, where they killed people off and blew up bad guys all over the place. The music was at different turns gloomy, scary, thrilling, stirring, and poignant. And the weapon of choice was, of course, the Wave Motion Gun! This was the wild card, the doomsday device, the last resort, last-ditch weapon that would always bust the Gamalons when everything else failed (just about every episode).
After screening the set, the story and art are still awesome, albeit perhaps not quite the same as when I watched it as a wide-eyed kid back in the day. Compared to ""Escaflone"" or ""Princess Mononoke"", the artwork is kinda primative. Of course, ""Star Blazers"" was made well before the advent of computer animation, so for a daily kid's show, it was pretty darn good considering the time constraints (as well as the huge amount of details on the ships), that the animators had to deal with. And the announcer? Boy, he sure does remind me of Gary Owens, that guy who played the radio announcer on ""Laugh-in""! Still, a great, great treasure in my DVD collection, along with a disc or two of ""Battle of the Planets"".
Bottom line; you need to buy this set if you even *pretend* to be into anime. It was a landmark in the world animation, let alone anime. Like ""Speed Racer"" and ""Kimba: the White Lion"" before it, ""Star Blazers"" helped usher in the flood of ""Japanimation"" (remember that old term?), we all loved as kids, and are enjoying even now as adults.

It had space warps, tachyon particles and holo-rooms along with the space storms, massive space battles and Bee-like aliens. Lots of missile attacks, an artificial sun and the powerful Wave-Motion Gun are just some of the plot devices to rush us along. Also full of hate, love and fear, making the characters almost, but not totally realistic. After all, Heros should not be too realistic.  We watch the crew change, some fighting to overcome the problems they face, while others are overwhelmed by the Quest.",1014249600,2,603,4.798076923076923
1648043,5,B00005QCWK,"Let's first get this out of the way. *ahem* This is NOT the best DVD set ever made.  Well, that being said, I can finally get tot he good stuff.  ""Star Blazers"" was one of the greatest(if not ""the greatest"") anime of all time.  Sure, it doesn't reach up to ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" level, but what ""Star Blazers"" lacks, it more than makes up for.
There isn't anything I can say about this title that hasn't been stated before.  It is revolutionary in all aspects.  Calling this ""space opera"" wouldn't do it justice.
""Star Blazers"" (or rather ""Space Battleship Yamoto"" as it was called before the 70's dub) brings all the aspects of a ""human"" story together.
You want love?  It's here!
You want drama?  You got it!
You want excitement? Look no further!
You want heart-wrenching-excitement-and-character-devolpment-beyond-the-naked-eye-can-see?.......okay I'll stop, but you get the idea!
Of course this series is from 70's so the animation seems dated.  But for those of you who CLAIM to know anything about anime, you should know that ""state-of-the-art"" animation is not always the best thing (after all, look at ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" or ""Blue Submarine No. 6""), in the end, it's the story that outshines everything else.
So, if you are an otaku, old or new, buy this and you can die a happy man/woman knowing that you have watched a significant landmark in anime.
""Star Blazers"" I salute you!

My only problem with this disc set is that 1 of the discs (disc 2) has a cover color that doesn't match the others. Maybe it's not a big deal, but it doesn't look nice on the shelf, and for $100, I think it should. Also, it upsets my OCD.",1515974400,,352,4.115942028985507
