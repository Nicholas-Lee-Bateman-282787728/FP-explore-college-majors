8664776,3,B00LA19CNO,Packaging was questionable I let it go. Would not recommend ordering this item to anyone. Just wanted as much Groban material as possible.,1521849600,,138,5.043478260869565
8664777,1,B00LA19CNO,"With word ""Documentary"" in title I thought this was official but DVD begins in middle of Josh interview with no intro or credits.  You can hear Josh's replies, but barely make out the questions he is answering.  All interview taken from one interview but no info on where, when, or who did the interview.  The first four clips are just OK quality wise, but the last three appear to be obtained straight from audience cell phones and like many poor quality seen on U-tube with terrible sound effects and lighting.  Entire thing appears to be downloaded U-Tube video compilation.  Save your money and watch better quality on U-Tube and for free.  Long live Josh!",1471478400,2,660,4.745614035087719
