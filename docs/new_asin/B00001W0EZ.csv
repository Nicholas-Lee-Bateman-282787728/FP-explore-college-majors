8561200,4,B00001W0EZ,"I bought this video for a friend who had helped organize the Unity Fair that year and a couple of others.  We and our friends enjoyed it.  It really took us back to those times.

My friend noted that many of the people interviewed or showcased were not necessarily representative of many of the folks involved who were dealing with ways of producing clean energy and living more in harmony with nature.

We sure enjoyed it though!",1231372800,,430,4.545454545454546
