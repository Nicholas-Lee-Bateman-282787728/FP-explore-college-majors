6198803,1,B00HQRCCV0,"This Jingle story is very different than the books. My 2.5 loves the books, but was very scared by the DVD. There is a mean dogcatcher going around town trying to catch dogs and jumping out at you from the screen. I was very disappointed Hallmark strayed so far from the books for this DVD. I would not recommend it to anyone.",1449187200,,326,4.274193548387097
