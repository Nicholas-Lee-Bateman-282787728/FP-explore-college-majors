547534,3,6303038883,"This 1951 offering from Lippert Pictures takes us 2500 miles underneath the surface with a group of somewhat annoying scientists.  Dr. Morley (dubbed the Prophet of Doom by at least one newspaper reporter) is an obsessive opponent of all things nuclear.  Fearing that atomic weapons will destroy all life on earth, he recruits a group of scientists for his Society to Save Civilization, and they make plans to find a living space deep within the earth where man can survive and rebuild from the nuclear holocaust they see just over the horizon.  After the group fails to secure any funding, a rich newspaper publisher's son forks over the cash and accompanies them on their monumental journey.  It's your typical group of B-movie scientists: there is Morley, who seems lost and mad at the world all the time, a couple of scientists who basically push buttons and read dials, a young and attractive feminist scientist, an explosives man, and the paperboy.  Of course, the group is constantly bickering and fighting, and no one likes the paperboy at all-at first.  This had to change somewhat because, as you would expect, he has to put the moves on the lady scientist and she has to pretend to resist.  How do our intrepid explorers go about their task?  They design a cyclotram, basically a great big ugly metal boxcar with a humongous drill for a nose, ascend to the top of an extinct volcano, go down into the crater and start drilling through rock as they make their way downward.  Every so often, they stop for a minute to fight or to provide an opportunity for one of them to die.  They are rather bumbling amateurs when it comes to the deep exploring gig; you would have thought one of the scientists would have remembered to pack a lot of water.  They sometimes even seem surprised to discover that it's actually pretty dark miles underground.
I was led to believe the group ran into dangerous animals in the depths of the earth, but that is not true.  There are similarities between Unknown World and Jules Verne's Journey to the Centre of the Earth, as you would expect, but this film never develops the aura of plausibility that Verne's work had.  To answer the question of how they will survive the intense heat of the earth's core, the geologist amongst them simply announces the fact that the temperature at the earth's core is actually lower than that on the surface.  This movie is only about 70 minutes long, so it's short enough to not become too aggravating too quickly.  Taken in the context of its time, it's really not such a bad movie.  Some may also be interested to know that part of the movie was actually filmed inside New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns.",1043107200,25,2675,4.683760683760684
547535,4,6303038883,"This is an early Sci Fi film from 1951 and in that context deserves to be appreciated!
Years ago I saw this film on TV and I never forgot it ... there was a kind of lonely mystique about it.
It has a very strong anti-nuclear orientation... The thesis of the film is a group of scientists fearful of nuclear war decide to explore vast caverns under the earth's surface as a refuge.  There are no phoney looking monsters running around... Some of the scenes were taken from actual caverns such as Carlbad Caverns, New Mexico.
The vehicle used for this exploration called a ""Cyclotram"" reminded me a little of a 1950 Lincoln...",1016323200,3,624,4.522123893805309
547536,3,6303038883,"Years before James Mason and Pat Boone undertook a ""Journey to the Center of the Earth,"" a team of resourceful explorers made the same  sort of trip inside a metallic contraption rather resmbling a house-trailer  equipped with a big drill on the front. Their goal is to find underground  caverns large enough to shelter the human race should nuclear war render  the surface of the planet uninhabitable.
Not surprisingly, the low-budget  special effects are amusing rather than impressive, and the no-name cast  can't enliven the uninspired lines they'd asked to deliver.
Despite these  expected failings, ""Unknown World"" earns a recommendation as one  of the early 1950's least-known and most-underrated sci-fi efforts. It has  an imaginative plot which, after awhile, almost seems plausible, and it  avoids the B-movie cliches you might expect in this sort of thing. (No  subterranean dinosaurs, no tribe of lost cavewomen, no signs of Atlantis.)  It also has the sense to stick to business and not detour into romantic  subplots or ""comic relief"" episodes.
If you can see beyond its  dated, low-budget look, you'll find this ""World"" one that's worth  exploring.",967766400,6,1163,5.244565217391305
547621,2,6303038883,"This movie is similar to the classic ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" filmed in 1959, eight years after this film.  However, while that movie is enjoyable because it combines the acceptable naivet&eacute; of Jules Verne's era with straightforward story telling, this movie ignores everything known in the 1950s about the interior of our planet.  Furthermore, this movie completely ignores any serious preparation for exploring the depths.  You can throw on top of this the absurdity of a machine with a drill diameter significantly less than the diameter of the vehicle that follows it.

Dr. Jeremiah Morley (Victor Kilian, a veteran of more than 100 movie and television appearances, including shows such as ""All in the Family"" and ""The Brady Bunch"") has decided that nuclear war will eventually doom humankind.  His solution is to find a home for humans inside the planet, safe from nuclear war.  Dr. Morley begins his project with great hope, but eventually all support is pulled.  Fortunately (or perhaps unfortunately), the millionaire son of a newspaperman decides to fund Dr. Morley's expedition, with the only proviso that he be permitted to go along.

Dr. Morley builds his vehicle, looking much like a spaceship with tail fins (seriously, the vehicle had fins, much like some cars of the 1950s).  The sad thing is that the vehicle's drill was only about half the diameter of the vehicle itself.  Also, the vehicle had a window in front with no shielding.  On the plus side, the vehicle did have a self-contained air supply, water and concentrated food.  On the negative side, the vehicle appeared to have no accommodation for sleeping.  Also, the vehicle seemed to run on an internal combustion engine, and though the explorers seemed to have anticipated toxic gases, the failed to anticipate a lack of oxygen or an explosive atmosphere.

The vehicle travels into the earth, which looks much like the side of a miniature hill much of the time, and a lot like Carlsbad Caverns the rest of the time.  There may have been some studio work thrown in as well.  There are several locations in Carlsbad Caverns that are used more than once, which I always find annoying in a movie.

Some of our explorers die as they encounter toxic gases and cut clotheslines (well, one of the climbing ropes looked a lot like clothesline to me).  However, we kind of expect that sort of thing in an exciting adventure into the unknown.  By using these deaths as inspiration, our explorers eventually find their way into a place where humans can live.

Once in the underground utopia, our explorers anticipate the birth of baby bunnies because that will tell our explorers how suitable man would find this environment.  Unfortunately, the baby bunnies are born dead because, here is a GREAT scientific conclusion, mammals are sterile under ground!  Huh?  I had to wonder what genius came up with sterility as being a cause of death.

Our explorers realize that living underground just is not going to work for humans, so they decide it is time to leave.  Coincidentally, intense volcanic activity begins the moment they decide to leave.  I have noticed that coincidences seem to be common in movies of this type.  The trip back to the surface was likely to be just as thrilling a trip as the descent was.

The principal problem with this movie is that it is just too superficial.  Given the amount of thought that Dr. Morley has put into his underground exploration, I would have thought that the expedition would have been much better prepared.  Compare the preparation of this expedition with the preparation of the expedition in the 1959 movie ""Journey to the Center of the Earth.""

The creatures in the latter movie were fantastic and would have been unbelievable in a supposedly science-based movie, but they added a lot of interest and entertainment to that movie.  I enjoyed the creatures since they were in the spirit of that era and that tale.  Perhaps this movie should have had some creatures thrown in for interest, but the creatures probably would have blown their budget.

This movie was okay for a one-time watch.  I doubt I will spend the time to watch it again because I struggled to maintain my interest.  There was some attempt to take a scientific approach, but ignoring what was known about the interior of the earth in the 1950s and blatant stupidities (the baby bunnies were born dead because creatures underground are sterile) just detracted from any enjoyment.  If you have to watch every movie made about journeys deep into the earth, you have to get this one.  If you want to get a movie that you have plenty of opportunity to pan, this one is good for that.  If you are looking for a good fantasy about exploring the center of the earth (assuming no molten core), then get 1959's ""Journey to the Center of the Earth.""

547622,4,6303038883,An interesting movie that reflects the time it was made in the 1950s when the world was concerned about nuclear war. If you like old sci fi movies you will enjoy this. A group of scientists travel to the centre of the world in a device called the cyclatron looking for a perfect alternate world. Of course what they find isn't the ideal alternative to the world above. If you don't like old sci fi movies then this will not change your mind.,1274918400,3,441,4.325301204819277
547623,4,6303038883,"I made a mistake.... bought this and then remembered that I already had a copy of this film - it was one of the movies in the ""100 Movie Pack Sci-Fi Classics"" mega pack. Anyway, this seems to be a slightly better copy of the film, plus the one 'extra"" is a slideshow catalog of movie posters that Alpha Video offers which I found interesting.

As several of the other reviewers mentioned, this is a 1950's take on the 'Journey to the Center of the Earth"" story. I like old b/w movies like this, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars.",1203724800,6,530,4.196078431372549
547624,2,6303038883,"""Unknown World"" is a 1951 cheapie starring nobody. The subject matter is pretty common by science fiction standards and predates ""At The Earth's Core"" by about twenty years. Though it lacks the unintentional charm of the later film starring Doug McClure and Peter Cushing, it follows a near identical plot.

The film opens with a faux cold war newsreel about the perils of nuclear weapons. The plot hinges on some scientists who form ""The Society to Save Civilization"" and propose building a machine to burrow into the Earth (which they claim is not only hollow, but is cool and full of fresh air) using a giant mechanical platypus called the ""cyclotram"" which ""is an amphibious conveyance based on the principles of an ovoidal atmosphere."" I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean, as my dictionary defines ""ovoidal"" as ""shaped like an egg,"" but I listened to this four times and I'm pretty sure that the secret is somewhere in the ovoidal atmosphere. Anyway...this expedition is the only hope for life on Earth as we know it. The logical proof of this statement is hard to follow, but just trust me: the cyclotram is our only hope.

I am sure this comes as a surprise to nobody, but they choose to begin their journey by burrowing into a volcano. (I'm not a vulcanologist, but this seems like predictably poor planning.) While they are driving the platypusmobile into the core of the Earth, they say things like ""Brother, it's really black out there"" and generally act like nits. It is a given that there is an onboard romance as well as boorish fistfights among the crew to establish who exactly is the Alpha-male. Did I mention that there is also a lengthy discourse on the formation of limestone? Yes, it's that exciting.

Eventually they overcome the travails of life at the cool, hollow Earth's core (which include sterile rabbits, water shortages, gas attacks, and the obligatory volcanic eruption) and, using their instrument made out of handwritten legend on graph paper, find themselves on the surface of the ocean near an island. That's where the film ends, which leads me to a question: what about the atom...am I crazy? Wasn't that the whole point of the movie?

This film is not only very dated and ponderous, but features characters that aren't very likeable. It also features one of the silliest means of conveyance ever filmed, and some extremely bad acting. Now for the good news: it was filmed in the Carlsbad Caverns National Park, so if you ever wanted to see the Carlsbad Caverns National Park, this is an excellent opportunity, though sadly the film is in black and white.",1147305600,4,2605,4.782222222222222

547626,3,6303038883,"I always enjoyed watching this film during the early 1950's.

I had an old ingolsorand power drill that looked like the cyclotram. Why is the quality so bad. I have a vrc copy that in much better? They must have made the DVD from the worst copy they could find.

During the 1960's and 1970's my brother and I were convinced that hollywood must have burned the original of this film, so I was delighted that a copy showed up. It is a great concept and kind of spooky and depressing, after all, it is dark under the earth, and should not be as cozy as a back lit cave as shown in the 1959 Journey to the Center of the Earth, which is another favority of mine anyway.

Soon, our heroic scientists and technicians are drilling through solid rock in their search for a subterranean paradise. It's a rough journey, as they encounter poison gas, cave-ins, floods, and many deaths along the way. UW isn't great, but it is good enough for any sci-fi collection.

There are some stretches of boredom, but at just over an hour in length, it still manages to move rather quickly.

547628,3,6303038883,"Sometimes the reviews I read here amaze me.  I'm not sure how people rate movies but I rate them based on other movies in the same genre.  That being said, Unknown World is definately a three star movie in the world of B grade 50's sci-fi.

These 'ambitious beyond their budget' filmakers chose to take a more serious route and the story is written displaying concern with the H Bomb and it's long term effects on civilization as we know it. It opens with a NewsReel style documentary on the project and makes good use of stock footage throughout.  The casting, acting and script are average for 50's sci-fi.  The drilling machine and scenes of the drilling to the center of the earth are very well done and the special effects are actually probably a bit above average for the time considering that all of the scenes outside the ship are actually filmed in Carlsbad Caverns as opposed to some cheap looking set.  This really gave an authentic and open feel to the film which rarely seen with others films of the time dealing with the same subject matter.  Other location filming also contributed to the larger than budget feel.  No, they never meet inner earth mutants or telepathic dinosaurs or find a lost civilization of amazon women, but that is to the film's advantage. No camp here.

The print is actually probably the worst in the Alphas series that I have seen.  There are several frames missing causing stilted dialouge and although there is severe film damage and discoloration periodically throughout, it is still very, very watchable and not of major concern.

Don't let other reviewers turn you off this one.  If you are a fan of 50's sci fi, you will love it.  Kudos to Alpha for bringing these forgotten classics to DVD at a very affordable price.  I found a new copy at my local video store for only $4.99.  You can hardly rent a movie for that price any more.
