Yes, this movie will affect your sensibilities; your hopes, desires, aversions and aspirations will be kindled and sometimes even questioned. I should also warn you about the 'Bollywood' packaging. But once you surrender yourself to the movie, i.e. accept it with an open mind you won't be disappointed with the 3-hour journey it takes you through - certainly I wasn't:).",1243641600,3,489,5.125

8341673,5,B001TJKW0E,"I have a love/hate relationship with Bollywood movies. Some of them, I love and some not even close to like. Delhi 6 is a wonderful blend of East and West film-making. It addresses the subject of an Indian man who has left India for the US returning to find himself, and of course, love.  You get the usually singing and dancing but with some actual acting in between.",1393804800,,368,4.411764705882353
8341674,5,B001TJKW0E,"Originally bought this to get the subtitles because I couldn't grasp the concept of the movie when I saw it before! Now with this DVD, I finally got the story line about the return of a young Americanized Indian coming back to his roots!",1385769600,,237,4.409090909090909
8341675,4,B001TJKW0E,"We liked this film. It is a family film. No ghosts or magic. No foul language or real violence (thematic 'elements' are present) and of course no sex, drugs, etc. This is a Hindi Film. No 'Bollywood' singing and dancing. It is funny and touching at the same time. The children seemed to enjoy it and we are glad we purchased another Hindi film they will watch over and over again.",1366588800,,380,4.366197183098592
8341676,5,B001TJKW0E,"This movie would of  probably been what we call in the states a sleeper hit if it had been made in english for other nations because it's a good movie with just the right amount of absurdity, laughs, tears and some great scenery of Delhi. I've watched it again and again and each time I see something new. The soundtrak is modern but smooth and upbeat mixed in with great vocals. I swear I thought I heard Sting in there somewhere.

PLOT

Delhi 6 unfolds with superb  cast of quirky characters that become intertwined in  an ongoing thread of idiocy and superstition that is prevailing about a black monkey. It's being featured constantly on the Delhi television stations as the improbable candidate for any number of local crimes that have been committed up to and including  deaths from sillyness . The real story of a homecoming and it's ups and downs is as much a paradigm as the ongoing epic religious play that is featured for the community. You first see the beauty but are also witness to the dangers of ignorance via the good and evil that abides in us all .

 As the story opens Abhi is shown escorting his aging grandmother home to her ancestral home in Delhi. She believes she is soon to die and wishes to re-acquaint herself with the remaining family there and if she is to die she wishes to return her ashes from whence she came . The reunion is sweet and all she could hope for. Abhi is  enchanted with the people of the neighborhood. Clicking away on his cell phone camera while he jogs, he's doing a tour guides job for us through the lens. Joining in the fun but entirely separated by his electronic devices. Ear buds in place. Camera in hand. Present in the moment but not part of it. This is never more apparent than when his ignorance of local police actions are witnessed. Part brutality, part bullying and all bribery. The police are comfortable in their domination of the victims but never seem to physically search for the criminals . The Beauty of this land is now marred like a cold bucket of water across a painted canvass; This beauty that was different and appealing is now oh so surreal.  All around him are the typical signs of sparks waiting to jump across the air to light a powder keg....but they fizzle out..or are they like most embers..waiting for the fuel to be fed . Ignorance and hatred are endless suppliers of energy.  THIS is the  duality that exist in ALL immigrants to all nations; how does one enjoy only the seemingly good things while turning their face away from the pain and need of others.

 Abhi is attracted to a local girl that lives in the house with the next rooftop terrace over ( Sonam Kapoor) . She  has a certain toughness but also an innate grace and innocence that catches his eye. Their families are intermingled in the neighborhood and he is becoming more and more attracted as he keeps running into her. When she is presented with a forced match she runs to the rooftop terrace to seeth in anger. Abi sees her with a bottle of  poison and  thinks she's being funny but then tries to intervene for her when she states she's being forced. She wants to be the next Indian Idol. She is shown practicing with a male friend who is really of poor character and just wants to get in her pants as we say here. She thinks he is going to run away with her and marry her if all HER chosen options are destroyed. All around Abhi people are beginning to act like they have lost their sense of reason and there is little he can do about it, or is there ?...  Hero's sometimes come in the oddest packages.",1337644800,,3555,4.418070444104135
8341677,5,B001TJKW0E,"Delhi 6 is a good movie with great images and music. I liked the views of Delhi as well as the storyline. The acting was pretty good and only added to the visual treat.  This is a movie that tries to illustrate that there is evil in everybody; we should not try to blame others for our own bad/negative behavior.  What most amazed me was the realistic way that a small disagreement can grow and take on a life of its own (especially within a political system that is very ""permissive"" in some respects, but repressive at the same time).  What a great example of the culture shock one experiences when submerged in a foreign culture/society.
Don't be turned off this movie by ho-hum reviews - take a chance and I think that you will not be disappointed.",1298073600,2,752,4.434782608695652
8341678,3,B001TJKW0E,"After the successful Aks and the blockbuster Rang De Basanti Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra directs this one. Delhi 6 follows Abhishek a half hindu and half muslim to come to India to help his grandmother Waheeda Rehman spend her last days in her birthplace. Set in old Delhi hence the zipcode 6. The movie provides a collage of characters and their brief character sketches and thus remains so. It does not come to the point until the end and then leaves us in a lurch wanting some more.
The first half is a gamut of characters from the two brothers Om Puri and Pawan Malhotra, the corrupt politician played by Vijay Raaz, the sultry untouchable Divya Dutta, the wicked money lender Prem Chopra, the idol aspirant Sonam Kapoor and the romantic bachelor Rishi Kapoor, all interesting but underdeveloped characters. The characters interact against the backdrop of a vicious monkey attack which is never solved.
The movie meanders towards the end with a very vague ending. Vijay Raaz is excellent, so is Pawan Malhotra, Abhishek Bachchan is getting better; the rest of the cast is completely wasted. The music and the cinematography are excellent. 3stars 12/28/09",1261958400,2,1154,4.923076923076923
8341679,2,B001TJKW0E,"India is an exotic foreign land to Roshan, a New Yorker of Indian origin (played by Abhishek Bachchan), who brings his sick grandmother back to her Delhi home. Filled with gorgeous urban footage, the film captures the wonder of seeing India for the first time, through an American's eyes, and the initial shock of amazement that any American who's ever been there will never forget. Roshan is thoroughly enchanted by all of it--the crumbling family abode in Chandni Chowk (one of the oldest parts of Delhi), its narrow lanes, its feisty neighbors--particularly the beautiful Bittu (Sonam Kapoor)--and its rich array of traditions. However, he chafes at the injustices he sees that offend his American sense of equality and fairness, putting him at odds with a place he suddenly can't live without. A bizarre subplot about a black monkey that's terrorizing the city--which is supposed to be symbolic of the discord that's always simmering below Delhi's surface--overtakes the main story, culminating in a ludicrous climax that ruins what started out as an intoxicating plunge into the soul of a complicated city. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1256515200,7,1346,5.872448979591836

""Delhi 6"" is a messy and overlong - though frequently appealing - tale of a young American man who travels to India to rediscover his roots.  When his grandmother is diagnosed with diabetes, Roshan agrees to accompany her back to the land of her birth so she can end her life at the same place where she began it.  While there, Roshan learns a thing or two about a culture he's been largely sheltered from in his life in New York.  This includes taking the bad along with the good:  the sense of community along with the antiquated caste system; the respect for tradition along with the adherence to ancient superstitions; the respect for law-and-order along with the corruption and cronyism of the police and politicians; the technological advances along with a scarcity of resources like electricity and water; the arranged marriages along with the flowering of true love.  That latter is particularly crucial to the story as Roshan falls for a beautiful, independent-minded woman whose father wants to marry her off to a man of his choosing even though her heart's desire is to perform as a singer on the popular TV show ""Indian Idol.""

Like most mainstream movies made in India, ""Delhi 6"" provides a relatively upbeat, prettified look at life in that country.  Any hint of poverty is pushed to the background, while the foreground becomes an almost nonstop dizzying swirl of music and color.  And I do mean ""nonstop,"" for if there is one thing ""Delhi 6"" has in abundance it's musical sequences, some of which drag on for an insufferably long time, adding an unnecessary burden to the movie`s overall running time.  The film also culminates in an overwrought scene that feels like a bizarre melding of ""West Side Story"" with ""Carousel.""

So what's likable about ""Delhi 6""?  Well, its cultural observations are sometimes compelling, particularly its portrayal of the tension that exists between Hindus and Muslims in that nation.  Also, the actors (Abhishek Bachchan, Sonam Kapoor, et. al.) are both physically attractive and energetic.  And while the humor occasionally veers towards the goofy and the ""villainous"" figures are largely two-dimensional stereotypes, the movie has a genuine affection for its characters and country (flaws and all) that finally wins us over.",1255219200,2,2281,5.015915119363395
8341681,4,B001TJKW0E,"Little B's acting just gets better and better.  This is another story about people with few special effects.  He goes on a mission to help his grand mother and finds his own mission of falling in love with a girl who hates him.  Somewhat typical story but done very well.

It is unfortunate for us in the health field that the closing scene is so far fetched!

I try to watch all of his movies because of his talent.  He does not disappoint.",1252713600,,441,4.253012048192771
