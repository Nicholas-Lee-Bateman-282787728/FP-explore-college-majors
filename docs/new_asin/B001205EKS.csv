I enjoyed every second!!",1401753600,,223,4.868421052631579

At first her energetic, animated style seemed amusingly over-the top, like a woman in acting school, but as I'm watching and listening to her, I realized how compelling and endearing it was to watch her. I now know this is how she stands out and apart from regular people and holds the attention of RMs! Plain & simply, she's fascinating & adorable, and knows how to use every ounce of her being to her advantage.  Ginie's insights and secrets into getting the upper hand in developing relationships with the Rich are very eye-opening. She not only has excellent advice on how to play your cards and conduct yourself (e.g., exactly how far to stand from them and how to position your body so you don't look intimidated, like the Rich's usual encounters who exhibit intimidation), but so much of her advice comes straight out of the knowledge of psychology. I regret I hadnt learned these skills earlier. She takes you from: How to get your own self (specific looks, attitudes, comfort level) ready, to where to 'mine' for the potential Rich Mates (""RM""s), to how to handle them with an edge over the competition, to getting them to the alter and sustaining their interest (and commitment) once married! I thought I was well-versed and well-experienced in dating, but boy did she make me realize the lifelong mistakes I've made. Now I realize how other potential mates have viewed my own dating behavior in the past, and why I never got them to the alter. She has alot of educated insights into the mindset of RM mates and sustaining relationships with them that I had never heard of, or read anywhere before, not even in Womens magazines. They ARE very different from the common folk. Her charming personality gives me something memorable to aspire to, and I will be channeling Ginie on all my future dates.  THANK YOU GINIE!",1289001600,3,1999,4.6440677966101696
8243240,5,B001205EKS,"What can I say but, ""You Go Girl!"". This book is packed full of insight into relationships. If you're out to marry the rich or not, this book was thoroughly enjoyable. SMART SMART SMART. I love this author. If you have an attitude like hers, the rich will sniff you out like gin. Well, I gotta go check the obituaries to see if there are any new (wealthy) widowers out there that may need a sympathetic shoulder to cry on....tata.",1220572800,3,430,4.3875
