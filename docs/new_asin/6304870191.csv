938086,1,6304870191,"This set is all in the packaging.  The sounds quality is poor, the images have not been enhanced.  Not worth buying.",946598400,12,116,4.476190476190476
938087,1,6304870191,Madacy appears to have quite a history of producing low quality transfers from film to DVD.  All one needs to do is look at other Amazon reviews (look at some of the Charlie Chaplin DVD reviews).  I was extemely  disappointed with this DVD set and wished I could get back my money.  It  was a complete waste of money.  We're lucky that Amazon has the ability to  review these so others don't waste their hard-earned money also.  Also  fortunate that Amazon has technical info so we can see who has produced the  DVD's.,944524800,49,518,4.473118279569892
938088,1,6304870191,"Having seen all these superb Hitchcock films before, I was expecting to enjoy the wonder of DVD viewing to enhance the next times around. No go -- owing to poor encoding problems and horrible packaging from the producers  (resulting in ALL of the discs coming off their spindles and perhaps being  the culprit behing tiny surface scratches), only one of the pictures was  even viewable. A gigantic waste of money. Go ahead and order if you must,  but be prepared for the hassle of sending it right back to Amazon.",941760000,32,513,4.666666666666667
7879143,5,6304870191,This is really great.  Had some VERY EARLY ones that even I hadn't seen!  Wow!,1482105600,,78,4.133333333333334
7879144,4,6304870191,"After reading all the terrible reviews, I had prepared myself for the worst. Actually the films are as good or better than most films of this era. I have all the early Hitchcock films and most of them are of this quality. I guess that some people were expecting quality similar to his later films. Sorry folks, that ain't gonna happen unless someone completely remasters them. These DVD's are fine and can be gotten at very cheap prices because of the terrible reviews. Get them while you can...",1354838400,,495,4.636363636363637

7879146,5,6304870191,"As the next reviewer states, these are recorded in EP mode and the quality suffers, BUT WHAT A COLLECTION! I was especially pleased to see that the 10th tape was Sean O'Casey's Juno and the Paycock. Hitchcock's early films are such a joy: German Expressionism, slapstick comedy, long, long takes that show off the stage sense of the actors and Hitchcock himself, the beginnings of his particular film style, and his deep sense of social justice. If you can afford The Early Years DVD Collection you will get most of the same films, with the exception of The 39 Steps and Juno and the Paycock, but for the price this beats anything.",1137715200,,631,4.642857142857143
7879147,4,6304870191,"These are ten early classic Alfred Hitchcock B&W movies all produced in the 1930s. Each film is close to 1 1/2 hours in length. Unfortunately, the VHS was recorded in EP mode so the quality of the reproduction suffers. However, since the films are all B&W that is not much of a problem. The price is right as the ten movies are available at around $15.",1103500800,,352,4.348484848484849
7879148,4,6304870191,"When I saw this at <unnamed discount DVD site> I had to order, and it just came. The packaging was impressive so I tore off the shrinkwrap. Found reviews for a different product from Madacy Entertainment, and mistakenly thought it was the same item: 5 Hitchcock movies, having the same photo of A.H. on the front, and the reviews were horrible and I went ""OMG, I tore off the shrinkwrap and can't return it! Oh no!"" Well, I popped disk two into my DVD player and watched the first 10 minutes of The Lady Vanishes and that seemed fine. Then I put in disk one and watched the whole thing on my 20"" TV (OK, it's not my front projection system, but I wouldn't expect great quality from an early 1930's movie on that anyway). It looked reasonably OK and the sound was passable, IMO. Watched Sabotage tonight and then The Man Who Know Too Much. Now I don't think I made a mistake. In the future I'll try to read reviews before buying, but I think this is probably a winner.",1102464000,,967,4.318681318681318
7879149,4,6304870191,"This set of Alfred Hitchcock videos is superb. Most of the videos included are his older ones but they are still wonderful. The Lady Vanishes ,Young and Innocent,secret agent,and the 39 steps are my favorite videos in this collection of 10 tapes . They are true Alfred Hitchcocks . They keep you in suspence until the murderer or kidnapper etc. is revealed and caught. I would suggest that if you like Hitchcocks you should definetley get this set it is a must for any Alfred Hitchcock fan . Your collection won't be complete without it!",973296000,5,537,4.663157894736842
7879150,2,6304870191,"I love Hitchcock, but ....  The big disappointment in this set is that all of the movies look like they were copied from old videotapes -- they're out of focus and have an amazing number of dropouts, flashes, and flickers.  Save your money.  Tape them from late night cable.",954115200,12,274,4.551020408163265
7879151,1,6304870191,"The contrast on the films can be poor. Limited special features not necessarily related to the film on the disk. No way to display the time or what chapter you are watching. It seemed that no effort was taken to ensure  a  good print was used to master from. Gosh, I wish I had the money I had  spent on these discs so I could get decent copies of these movies.",951091200,8,361,4.056338028169014
7879152,1,6304870191,"The editorial review from Amazon.com states, ""The prints of the films used in this box set are serviceable and probably comparable to average 16mm classroom or museum presentations.""  All I can think is that Mr.  Keogh is lying or didn't actually watch the discs.  The transfers are among  the worst ever on DVD, which is typical of all Madacy titles.  The films on  the discs are unfortunately great - too bad they're unwatchable.  Avoid  this collection like the plague, and wait for re-releases from reputable  distributors.",950832000,24,527,5.034883720930233
