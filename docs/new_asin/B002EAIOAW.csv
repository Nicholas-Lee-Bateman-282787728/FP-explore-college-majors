8689562,3,B002EAIOAW,"I bought this video because a woman who is a deer hunting course instructor showed the video to a group and I thought it might be a useful reference if I ever needed to hunt for survival.  I have since thought better and realized this is just an awful series of women killing defenseless animals simply for the thrill of killing, and their seemingly faked responses of panting, heavy breathing, high-fiving, etc. after getting the kills became boring and eventually very annoying after the first time or two.

It seems that this version, subtitled ""Dressed to Kill,"" might have been an attempt to duplicate a prior, better video titled ""Dressed to Kill,"" but this version was not nearly as interesting as the prior version.  I bought them at about the same time, but happened to have already viewed this prior to purchasing it.

It seemed fairly obvious in both videos that the women were killing for the thrill of killing, so having viewed this video a couple times, I am pretty sure that I will never view it again.

Would I recommend it to others?  Yes, but only to first-time women hunters or non-hunters who want an idea of what goes on during a modern-day hunt when defenseless wild animals are basically murdered for the entertainment of the hunters.  Murder is a strong word, but that is what most of the kills on this video looked like to me - flat out murder.

It should have been rated two and a half stars, but since this was actually the first time that I ever viewed women hunters, I give it three stars ... for the novelty of it all.",1404345600,,1548,4.523297491039426
8689563,5,B002EAIOAW,"Great DVD.  I didn't buy it online, but am considering purchasing additional copies to share with other females who have an interest in hunting.  I have been going out for years, but I loved seeing the reaction of the women in the video.  Great way to introduce someone to the outdoors and everything you can do.  It isn't just for women either.  I shared it with the guys in camp a couple weeks ago.",1274054400,,400,4.351351351351352
