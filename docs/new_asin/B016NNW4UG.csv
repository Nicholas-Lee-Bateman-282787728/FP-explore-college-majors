8736831,5,B016NNW4UG,"For those (like me) who don't have the videoclips on any format, this is a nice collectors item. Mainly bought it for the older videoclips (don't much care for the newer ones) and the extra features. The Wembley Arena footage is a bit of a letdown; poor video quality and the audio mix is way off. Vocals overall too loud, Rick's guitar being low in volume where the keyboards are too high in volume, not to mention the drummix...

What an excellent reason to buy this dvd is, is the almost 30 minute version of Is it really me?/Gotta go home. Very cool to see and hear what would become integral parts of the 4500 Times live versions.",1501891200,,635,4.38135593220339

8736834,5,B016NNW4UG,"If you're a Status Quo fan, this set is a must. I pretty much spans the history of the Quo in music videos and concert footage. You will definitely get your Status Quo fix watching this DVD set.",1456531200,,194,4.131578947368421
8736835,4,B016NNW4UG,"In short, this is a great DVD set and a must have for any Quo fan. It is also region free so it will play on any player in the world. Just about all of the band's music videos are here and it really presents a great chronological visual history of this underrated and enduring British rock band.

The real gem on here is the 27-minute jam from the Beat Club in Germany in 1970. I had never seen that clip before and it is definitely one of the best early clips of the band ever released. The video quality on this clip is quite good and it captures some rare moments of original bassist Alan Lancaster playing a bass solo and improvising with lead guitarist Francis Rossi. It really shows another side of the band that I hadn't really fully realized, even as a long time fan. I only wish they could have included the other songs from this session. I have seen clips of the band playing ""Spinning Wheel Blues"" and ""April Spring Summer and Wednesdays"" from this same performance and it would have been great to own an uninterrupted complete video of the whole session. Also great on here is the selection of songs from Download Festival 2014 featuring some awesome live footage of the current line up of the band. I was not expecting this footage to be so well filmed and with audio so well mixed. Quo are absolutely killing it here and the footage captures that Quo managed to win over the heavy-metal audience and had them all bouncing and singing along to Rockin' All Over The World. I would love to see this complete show released one day on Blu-ray.

Recent music videos from 2010-2013 are featured here in excellent quality, and look almost as good as Blu-ray. I was actually surprised with how good videos like ""Looking Out For Caroline"" and ""It's Christmas Time"" looked. However, this should make sense seeing as they were shot in HD, as is typical nowadays.

One of the areas this set fall short however is in the quality of music videos pre-2010. A lot of these clips are from the 70s and 80s, and I realize you can't expect amazing quality from films shot during this era, but I'm sure that videos from 2000-2007 especially could have been given an HD transfer or remastered in some way, but it's clear that they were just thrown onto here in their original form along with the earlier clips. When you look at the newly released Beatles ""1"" video anthology, the quality is spectacular because they took the time to remaster all of the original films. These Quo videos here just pale in quality by comparison, and it is a shame because some of their videos are quite good. I also wish they could have been more complete about this collection and included every last video the band made - I can think of a few that are missing like ""In My Chair"" and ""Technicolor Dreams."" It was probably a matter of money time, and disc space, but it really was a missed opportunity to present an ""ultimate video collection"" in as pristine quality as possible.

The footage from Wembley 1996 is good to see if you're a fan, but the audio mix is so poor that it's hard to enjoy listening to, which again is a shame because the band is clearly on fine form at this concert. You will likely only ever watch this once, so it truly is a bonus feature here. There is also a horribly long delay between videos, so trying to ""play all"" and watch them all back to back is pretty tedious and I found myself having to manually go to the next chapter with my remote. As for audio set-up options, there surprisingly are none, and audio quality varies quite a bit from song to song, with songs before 2010 sounding generally poor and worse than they do on their CD versions. This is another area that they could have easily fixed by just replacing the audio tracks with the newer digital masters. The menus in the DVD are also pretty bare bones - nothing really special, though they do play a loop of Quo song snippets in the background, which actually sound much better than the audio on the videos, strangely enough.

I really don't want to sound like I'm complaining, because you do get a lot of stuff here and I think this is generally a good set. The Beat Club session is worth it alone, and the Download Festival footage along with videos from 2010-2013 are here in excellent quality. I should also mention that there are some unreleased videos on here, such as ""Who Asked You?"" which are great to finally see, and though the quality might not be stellar, the band's music videos are entertaining and fun to watch and may bring back memories. There are several that I really particularly love, and it's nice to have them available now. If this set had been released in 2002, I would have given it 10/10 and had no issues with the quality, but in 2015, standards have gone up and this just falls short on the technical side. They should have remastered each video and released this on Blu-Ray. Who knows, maybe we'll see that one day, but for now this is as good as it gets. As something presenting a visual history of a remarkable and criminally underrated band, it succeeds for the most part.

PS - If you own their older DVD ""XS All Areas - The Greatest Hits"" you will have much of this material already, but there is enough new material here for you to find it worth owning both.",1451433600,2,5265,4.439503619441572
