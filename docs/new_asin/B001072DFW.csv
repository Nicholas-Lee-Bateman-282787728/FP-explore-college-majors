3048155,1,B001072DFW,"I bought this DVD set for my grandpa as he enjoys the television show with Rin Tin Tin, Rusty, and Lt. Rip Masters. However those paying attention will have noticed that show is the Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, while this DVD set is the LEGEND of Rin Tin Tin. It is the serial for the movies The Adventures of Rex and Rinty, The Law of the Wild, The Lightening Warrior, and The Lone Defender. These were all made between 1930-1935. The audio and video are terrible quality and the acting is often frantic and I couldn't really follow what was even going on. Never mind my poor 92 year old grandfather who just ended up falling asleep it was so bad. I am extremely disappointed to say the least. Fortunately, I didn't pay much.

3048166,5,B001072DFW,"I've read the reviews and I think that folks need to step back and take a breather here....right there on the box...in pretty good sized print...1930-1935...B&W...and folks were disappointed that there were no tv episodes? THERE WAS NO TV yet!.....ALSO...stated right below the dates.... it said ""movie serials from the golden age of cinema""...What more could you want? They tell you right then and there what year and where they came from...So why all the complaining? I'm terribly sorry that you 'wasted' your $$ on this...but if you don't read the package...you shouldn't really complain!

Now...for the good part...I loved this series, took me back to  my pre-tv days sitting in the darkened theater with my nickel bag of popcorn and soda, awaiting with baited breath for the next exciting adventure to be on the big screen. On many respects the newsreels and the serials were better than the main attraction....

The film quality is definitely NOT Hi Def, and the sound can be a bit muddied on occasion, but the adventure and the excitement of watching something from my childhood trumps those little bits of negativity...Overall, a good value for the dollar...considering you're getting 48 complete episodes...

If you are a true fan f old time movie serials and heroic adventures from days gone by...spend the $$ for this series, you'll not be disappointed.  If...however...you were expecting Hi Def film quality, color and tv segments...it's not to be found in this package.",1364688000,4,1482,5.082304526748971

Could barely understand what was being said, and quickly lost interest. It wound up being on for at least a couple of hours as background noise, only, since we couldn't hear or really understand what was going on. May as well have been a silent movie.

3048173,4,B001072DFW,"I had seen this set and the one that preceded it,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Legend-of-Rin-Tin-Tin/dp/B001072DFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Legend of Rin Tin Tin</a>&nbsp;also by Mill Creek, on store shelves but had overlooked it while assuming that it was 48 episodes of the old Rin Tin Tin TV show of the 1950s. When I happened to look at the fine print, I saw that it was really four full Saturday movie serials. In order, they are:

The Lone Defender (1930, rated 5.4 on IMDB)
The Lightning Warrior (1931, 5.7)
The Law of the Wild (1934, 6.5)
The Adventures of Rex and Rinty (1935, 6.5)

The first two are still steeped in their stagy, silent roots, and the deteriorated quality of the prints doesn't help any. The two more ""modern"" serials, also starring Rex the Wonder Horse, have better prints and more mature acting. But down deep, all of these were designed to amuse children with lots of good guys fighting bad guys.

In an interesting departure, Mill Creek also included a short original documentary (C) 2011. It consists of one unnamed guy seated before a non-moving (green screened?) background, talking to the camera for about a paragraph at a time. He's not an awful reader, but he's no Robert Osborne. Every now and then, he seques into a short clip from one of the serials in the set. All in all, it's a nice gesture, but the insight it added was about what you'd get from reading Wikipedia.

In sum, I rate it five stars for four full classic serials at such a cheap price, then subtract one for the erratic print quality. If you don't like serials, avoid this set. If you do like serials, give it a try.

3048174,5,B001072DFW,I was so excited to see this novel had been published.  Author is excellent writer.  Our granddaughter who loves dogs will enjoy reading this book.,1322352000,7,147,4.84
3048175,5,B001072DFW,"This collection was not what I expected. I thought I was buying the TV series with a Rusty and Rinty as members of the 101st Cavalry. ""The Legend of Rin Tin Tin"" is actually a collection of four movie serials which predate the TV series and are only associated with it via Rin Tin Tin's name, and his equally talented descendents who appear in many episodes of both series.

Although this collection was not what I expected I was not disappointed. If you enjoyed the TV series you will most likely enjoy these movie serials as well.

As with the TV series, some of the dogs used in filming the serials were descendents of the original Rin Tin Tin who as a puppy was rescued from a bombed out kennel in France by an American soldier during World War I, and as a film star was credited with saving Warner Brothers Pictures from bankruptcy.

For future reference: the TV series was called ""The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin"".",1318032000,3,918,4.4523809523809526
3048176,4,B001072DFW,"As long as you realize that this DVD set contains 4 movie serials with 12 chapters each and not the Rin Tin Tin TV series you should be pleased with this DVD set. Mill Creek uses the word ""episodes"" on a number of DVD sets that contain movie seials from the 30's and 40's on what I consider ""chapters"". Technically, the star is Rin Tin Tin Jr. The original Rin Tin Tin starred in silent movies. Mill Creek always does a good job of film to DVD transfer, but there is a quality limit depending on the condition and age of the film.",1271808000,5,530,4.155339805825243

3048178,5,B001072DFW,"These serials show the original Rin Tin Tin and Rin Tin Tin Jr. in action. Rin Tin Tin died in 1930, and so one of his offspring took over the main acting role in the mid 1930s. This is 15 hours of the Original that was the basis of the later on TV series which contained later generations of Rin Tin Tin; I believe 4th generation of Rin Tin Tin were on the TV series.

The video quality starts rough, but smooths out over the first thirty seconds of the serial. No drops of quality from Chapter to Chapter, it stays constant. The audio is descent, especially for the age. Again, we're talking about early 1930s, just crank the volume up on the TV a bit and enjoy these classics. Just watching Rin Tin Tin and his actions are worth the price of admission. This includes some very humorous and interesting actions between Rin Tin Tin and other people as well as animals.

I can honestly say this was the best $5.00 I spent in along time (Wal-mart). If you don't mind the image quality, which I can say is not bad considering its age (main flaw being a slight fade in the center of the film, but it so faint it is barely noticeable), and audio which all the dialogue can be heard with a slight volume boast of your remote then purchase this. This DVD purchase made me a fan of Rin Tin Tin, and i'm sure it will make even more fans in the future.",1264464000,8,1343,4.2015503875969

I will say the color box package does not match the contents. But for $5 its a lot of fun.  I like old movie serials, so to me its not a bad value.  They are what they are...  The transfer quality is okay, at least you can see and hear everything. Again for $5...

3282652,1,B001072DFW,"I bought this DVD set for my grandpa as he enjoys the television show with Rin Tin Tin, Rusty, and Lt. Rip Masters. However those paying attention will have noticed that show is the Adventures of Rin Tin Tin, while this DVD set is the LEGEND of Rin Tin Tin. It is the serial for the movies The Adventures of Rex and Rinty, The Law of the Wild, The Lightening Warrior, and The Lone Defender. These were all made between 1930-1935. The audio and video are terrible quality and the acting is often frantic and I couldn't really follow what was even going on. Never mind my poor 92 year old grandfather who just ended up falling asleep it was so bad. I am extremely disappointed to say the least. Fortunately, I didn't pay much.  Congrats to those of you who got what you were looking for, but for us this wasn't it.",1410393600,,812,4.30718954248366

THERE WAS NO TV yet!.....ALSO...stated right below the dates.... it said ""movie serials from the golden age of cinema""...What more could you want? They tell you right then and there what year and where they came from...So why all the complaining? I'm terribly sorry that you 'wasted' your $$ on this...but if you don't read the package...you shouldn't really complain!

Now...for the good part...I loved this series, took me back to  my pre-tv days sitting in the darkened theater with my nickel bag of popcorn and soda, awaiting with baited breath for the next exciting adventure to be on the big screen. On many respects the newsreels and the serials were better than the main attraction....

The film quality is definitely NOT Hi Def, and the sound can be a bit muddied on occasion, but the adventure and the excitement of watching something from my childhood trumps those little bits of negativity...Overall, a good value for the dollar...considering you're getting 48 complete episodes...

If you are a true fan f old time movie serials and heroic adventures from days gone by...spend the $$ for this series, you'll not be disappointed.  If...however...you were expecting Hi Def film quality, color and tv segments...it's not to be found in this package.",1364688000,4,1482,5.082304526748971

Could barely understand what was being said, and quickly lost interest. It wound up being on for at least a couple of hours as background noise, only, since we couldn't hear or really understand what was going on. May as well have been a silent movie.

When I happened to look at the fine print, I saw that it was really four full Saturday movie serials. In order, they are:

The Lone Defender (1930, rated 5.4 on IMDB)
The Lightning Warrior (1931, 5.7)
The Law of the Wild (1934, 6.5)
The Adventures of Rex and Rinty (1935, 6.5)

The first two are still steeped in their stagy, silent roots, and the deteriorated quality of the prints doesn't help any. The two more ""modern"" serials, also starring Rex the Wonder Horse, have better prints and more mature acting. But down deep, all of these were designed to amuse children with lots of good guys fighting bad guys.

In an interesting departure, Mill Creek also included a short original documentary (C) 2011. It consists of one unnamed guy seated before a non-moving (green screened?) background, talking to the camera for about a paragraph at a time. He's not an awful reader, but he's no Robert Osborne. Every now and then, he seques into a short clip from one of the serials in the set. All in all, it's a nice gesture, but the insight it added was about what you'd get from reading Wikipedia.

In sum, I rate it five stars for four full classic serials at such a cheap price, then subtract one for the erratic print quality. If you don't like serials, avoid this set. If you do like serials, give it a try.

3282672,5,B001072DFW,"This collection was not what I expected. I thought I was buying the TV series with a Rusty and Rinty as members of the 101st Cavalry. ""The Legend of Rin Tin Tin"" is actually a collection of four movie serials which predate the TV series and are only associated with it via Rin Tin Tin's name, and his equally talented descendents who appear in many episodes of both series.

Although this collection was not what I expected I was not disappointed. If you enjoyed the TV series you will most likely enjoy these movie serials as well.

As with the TV series, some of the dogs used in filming the serials were descendents of the original Rin Tin Tin who as a puppy was rescued from a bombed out kennel in France by an American soldier during World War I, and as a film star was credited with saving Warner Brothers Pictures from bankruptcy.

For future reference: the TV series was called ""The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin"".",1318032000,3,918,4.4523809523809526

Technically, the star is Rin Tin Tin Jr. The original Rin Tin Tin starred in silent movies. Mill Creek always does a good job of film to DVD transfer, but there is a quality limit depending on the condition and age of the film.",1271808000,5,530,4.155339805825243

3282675,5,B001072DFW,"These serials show the original Rin Tin Tin and Rin Tin Tin Jr. in action. Rin Tin Tin died in 1930, and so one of his offspring took over the main acting role in the mid 1930s. This is 15 hours of the Original that was the basis of the later on TV series which contained later generations of Rin Tin Tin; I believe 4th generation of Rin Tin Tin were on the TV series.

The video quality starts rough, but smooths out over the first thirty seconds of the serial. No drops of quality from Chapter to Chapter, it stays constant. The audio is descent, especially for the age. Again, we're talking about early 1930s, just crank the volume up on the TV a bit and enjoy these classics. Just watching Rin Tin Tin and his actions are worth the price of admission. This includes some very humorous and interesting actions between Rin Tin Tin and other people as well as animals.

I can honestly say this was the best $5.00 I spent in along time (Wal-mart). If you don't mind the image quality, which I can say is not bad considering its age (main flaw being a slight fade in the center of the film, but it so faint it is barely noticeable), and audio which all the dialogue can be heard with a slight volume boast of your remote then purchase this. This DVD purchase made me a fan of Rin Tin Tin, and i'm sure it will make even more fans in the future.",1264464000,8,1343,4.2015503875969

I will say the color box package does not match the contents. But for $5 its a lot of fun.  I like old movie serials, so to me its not a bad value.  They are what they are...  The transfer quality is okay, at least you can see and hear everything. Again for $5...
