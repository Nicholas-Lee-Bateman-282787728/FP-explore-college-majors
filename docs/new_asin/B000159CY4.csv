8006604,5,B000159CY4,"This is the story of Misaki, she's moved to Tokyo to attend middle school and live with her aunt. On her first day there she sees an ""Angelic Layer"" battle on TV and falls in love with it. In Angelic Layer people compete using dolls they remotely control with their mind to fight. It's a very popular game that has a huge fan base and lots of skilled competitors. Misaki gets an Angel and starts to play Angelic Layer. Through the game she meets lots of new friends and even unlocks secrets about her past, like the true identity of her mother and father.

This anime is mainly a fun & games type show. It has a lot of good lessons to teach about love and friendship with a descent amount of drama, but it's not upsetting drama; it's more fulfilling. I have loved every CLAMP anime I've ever seen and this is no exception. It's not as emotionally heavy as X or Tsubasa, but it's a nice change of pace. It think this is also one you can sit down and watch with the whole family. Young and old can find something charming about this little gem.",1356739200,,1042,4.262626262626263

8006607,5,B000159CY4,"Seriously, I originally bought the first volume because I figured my wife would like it. Lo and Behold I became hooked. The series has humor, action, interesting and dynamic characters and is very well produced. If you are looking for something gory and violent then this is not it. But if you want a fun series that is both good for a date and kids then I highly recommend this series.",1127001600,,386,4.450704225352113
8006608,5,B000159CY4,"Misaki and her Angel Hikaru continue to battle their way to victory.  But they have to be careful.  In the Kanto Regional Games you're out after only one loss.  Just one defeat and Misaki can be disqualified.  But if she makes it then the next stop is the semi-finals!
First she has to go against Ringo Seto, a popular idol, and then she has to go against the Fujisaki sisters (one builds the angels while the other one pilots them).  The sisters want to win at ANY cost and this mini-plot covers two episodes.  After that Sai, one of the other girls she has yet to fight, tells Misaki that is would be interesting to see if she finds out Hikaru's weak point before fighting against Sai and her Angel.
The last episode is about Misaki trying to find what her weak point IS while going on a ""date"" with Kotaro.  Was Sai just trying to freak her out or is there something she still has to work on?
Lots of action, lessons about life and great extras in the form of artwork and commentary about one of the episodes by David Williams (ADR Director) and Shelly Calene-Black (the voice of Madoka - the older Fujisaki sister).  She also happens to be Mireille from ""Noir"", a show that has grown on me, so I was pretty pleased to hear her talk about her voice work.",1086048000,3,1257,4.319148936170213
8006609,5,B000159CY4,"I loved this latest installment of Angelic Layer. There's more exciting angel battles in store, more new friends of course, and perhaps some new romance? The mystery surrounding Misaki's mother unravels a little more in the course of these episodes. Competition is fierce, and not all Deuses play fair. When the Fujisaki sisters break the rules, all bets are off. Will Misaki and Hikaru be able to overcome this new challenge? Misaki and Kotaro spend a day together -- is it a date? Will Kotaro tell Misaki how he feels about her? All this and more are in these four exciting episodes of Angelic Layer!",1075420800,,602,4.742857142857143
