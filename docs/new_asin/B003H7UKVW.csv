8396855,3,B003H7UKVW,"While shot well and with a solid lead actor, a Closed Book never quite delivers. The film is based on an obscure book, which differs from the movie in that the two major characters happen to be men.

The most redeeming quality of the film is the performance by Tom Conti as Sir Paul, the grumpy blind author whom Daryl Hannah's character must assist. Hannah looks noticeably different in Closed Book, apparently the result of recent plastic surgery. Her performance is uninspiring, though it seems to have generated a buzz thanks to several nude scenes. Hannah is still hot for a woman of 50 years, though one of the film's two nude moments clearly involves a younger body double. Sexy blonde actress Ty Glaser is cryptically credited as ""Jane's successor"" for this film, which seems to solve that mystery.

I liked the way the film was shot, and the motive for Jane's sadistic behavior was mildly intriguing, but the movie never really grabbed me. Overall, Closed Book seemed like a film with some potential, but a weak execution. Consider renting it before you decide to buy the DVD, unless you're a serious fan of Tom Conti.",1272067200,,1127,4.744897959183674
