7359952,1,B0131QYG40,Perhaps the lamest thing I've ever seen.  The other reviews HAVE to be from someone with interest in this film.  Your middle school kid could do a much better job.  Don't waste a cent on this,1450915200,6,191,4.25
7359953,5,B0131QYG40,"Great low-budget indie! If you're a fan of the genre & want to see something that is not heavily advertised on TV and in the media, yet really, really good and creative, I absolutely recommend it. Great acting, too. Mark Aaron totally nails it.",1449792000,3,244,4.568181818181818

This movie had this jittery drug double image effect that does make you sort of feel like on drugs.  It worked.

I hate bumping into gun toting strangers while camping.  This is what can go wrong.",1475884800,,275,4.708333333333333
7359958,2,B0131QYG40,"Ed (Paul S. Tracey) and Amy (Lindsay Atwood) need to get away so they go camping in the woods, Ed knew. These are the same woods where we saw Charlie (Mark Aaron) earlier kidnap and rape a woman (Katie Royer). Not to give too much away, but Charlie is simply looking for the right someone to save and be with during the up and coming apocalypse. Having figured out his current squeeze may not be the right one, Charlie turns his eyes to....

I think most of us have this thing pegged early on. The problem I had was that I found Charlie a more likeable person than our bickering camping couple. Their acting won't win any awards. It is a ""been there, done that"" type of film that doesn't have anything new to make it a worth while sitting.

8726894,3,B0131QYG40,"SPOILERS: Two stars for the excellent movie title! Also for naming the Charlie Manson-like main character ""Charlie.""  My beef with this movie is that there were no characters to root for.  The so-called romantic leads were so very deserving of being ritually murdered by Charlie after all their douchebaggery behavior in the city and plain out stupidity in the woods.  It was like watching red riding hood and hansel and Gretel and goldilocks, all rolled up into one huge cautionary tail.  You just want to scream at the screen. Don't do drugs! Don't steal from your dealer! Don't talk to strangers! And def don't go home with strangers to do drugs and play with their guns when they offer!  That is a lure! It is dangerous! How did you survive to adulthood?  Therefore I could not suspend my disbelief and buy into the idea that these nincompoops would actually survive in the end.  Completely unrealistic unending.",1476576000,2,916,4.833333333333333
