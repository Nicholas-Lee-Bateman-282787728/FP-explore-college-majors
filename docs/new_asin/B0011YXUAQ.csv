3070455,5,B0011YXUAQ,"Wanted to learn more about Coach Ladaceour's methods and why his teams win so much.  This documentary is really interesting.  It shows a lot of in the locker room speeches and focus' on 4 players and their stories.

It chronicles the 13 weeks of the 2000 season where De La Salle held the winning streak intact and the teams goes through a lot of adversity during the year - you can feel the pressure that the QB is facing and how difficult it is to live up to expecations and play in big football games.

One of my favorite scenes in the film was when Coach Lad went off on the kids because they had a food fight at one of the player's parent's home during a team meeting.  He really teaches them a lesson here and it has nothing to do with football but more about life...His quote is ""That's a f....ng reality""  its interesting to see all the players not take their eye off him as he reads them the riot act and its well deserved - great drama and its real - no acting.

Again, people interested in coaching or youth sports should watch this film as it is real and raw.  The language is tough so not for young kids although the dvd has a toned down language version.  Amazing to see the hitting going on in HS Football - DJ williams and Simon and Demetrious Williams can really hit on both offense and defense.  You see guys like Maurice Drew, Derek Landri in the film in the background when they were just the role players.  They played against Matt Leinert at Mater Dei and blasted them.  Amazing to see where the 4 players on DLS focused on wind up - you'll have to watch.

some of the games are not pieced together real well - wanted to see the final scores of some games and what happened but overall a fine documentary.  coach eidson was not a good model in this film as he actually calls out guys by their names in front of the whole team - rips them a new one - and embarrasses them in front of the team and cameras - guess they screwed up.

Not sure why not more review on this DVD - I watched it after hearing a KNBR radio interview on Coach Ladeceour and hearing how pleased he was with the film.",1231113600,10,2109,4.172839506172839

3070457,5,B0011YXUAQ,This is a great video for any serious coach or teacher at any level.  The lessons instilled in these players are relevant to anyone in any walk of life.,1354492800,,152,4.241379310344827
3070458,5,B0011YXUAQ,"Kudos to the team that pulled together this fine documentary.  Very inspiring.  I was particularly impressed by the coaches.  They talked about ""perfect effort"" - playing to your ability and being committed to yourself and your teammates - never mentioning the need to win.  I'm reminded of how John Wooden handled his UCLA team during their record setting basketball streak years ago.  The coaches at De La Salle have put together a great program.",1336435200,,448,5.0
3070459,4,B0011YXUAQ,I've watched this at least 10 times since I purchased it. We show it to younger players in our organization. Instant classic. Production and soundtrack work extremely well.,1330128000,,172,5.178571428571429
3070460,5,B0011YXUAQ,This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen regarding what it's like to grow up and feel the pressure that is life. It shows what hard work and leadership can accomplish - it's a must see for any high school athlete or student for that matter.,1308873600,,254,4.204081632653061
3070461,5,B0011YXUAQ,"Bottom line, this is the best football doc I've ever seen.  More importantly, it's the best glimpse into what it takes to be a successful teacher.  Bob LaDouceur is a teacher first and a coach second.  Filmmaker Steve Lilly and his team get unfettered access into what it's like to teach and coach high school kids these days.  The 151 game winning streak is a by-product of LaDouceur's leadership and that's what Perfect Effort proves.

This movie should be required viewing for every young athlete (and their parents).  I can't wait to show this movie to my son when he's age appropriate.

Perfect Effort is just that, a perfect effort.",1306022400,,638,4.745454545454545
3070462,5,B0011YXUAQ,"This is a beautifully written doc about De La Salle High school and their incredible winning streak of 151 games. Living in the Bay Area, I always heard about De La and how invincible they were for all of those years. Stephen Lilly has put a face and more importantly a heart on this institution and shown how and why they are what they are. Truly inspirational and gorgeously shot and narrated. I highly recommend it for any true sports fan.",1302393600,,442,4.469135802469136
3070463,5,B0011YXUAQ,"What made this film stand out from other sports doc types, is the access that the crew had. It is pretty rare to be able to see and hear the locker room discussions and all the on field conversations, etc. This kind of access provided a really human and tangible perspective that keeps the viewer feeling really close to the story.

The De La Salle legacy is a pretty amazing one on it's own- this portrayal gives you the non glamourized, no BS storytelling it deserves. A great watch",1301875200,,484,4.438202247191011
3070464,5,B0011YXUAQ,This is a great video to give you an inside perspective into a great high school football program. This video goes into the mystique during a year where the team went through some struggles with leadership.,1288915200,,206,4.75
3070465,5,B0011YXUAQ,"This is an excellent film about a football program first; the sport of football second. Perfect Effort isn't about the skill of the individual players or about fast-moving football action (although not to worry - there are still some amazing plays that are highlighted) - it's about the program the DLS coaches have developed to create an amazing group of talented young men not just for one season, but year after year.

The respect, the confidence and the drive that Ladouceur commands from his players is something to be applauded. All coaches - high school to pro - should take a page from Ladouceur's book on how to not just teach players how to win a game, but how to instill the pride and motivation in young male and female athletes, regardless of what stage of their life they're in.

This is a must-see for both coaches and players of any program, to emphasize there's much more to being a successful and respected athlete or coach than just the stats you throw up on the board.",1269302400,4,988,4.607954545454546
