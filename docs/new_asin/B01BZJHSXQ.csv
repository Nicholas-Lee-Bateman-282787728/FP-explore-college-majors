7671622,5,B01BZJHSXQ,"With the direction that Hollywood has gone today, it is refreshing to have something of substance to watch.  This may not have the viewership of a ""Scandal"", ""Revenge"", ""Lucifer"", but it is independent movies like this that signal there is redemption for man in this wicked, evil world.  If you need to take a sabbatical away from the filthy, vulgar, depressing nature of television and movies today, then get this movie.  You won't be disappointed.",1456876800,,449,4.96

8751989,5,B01BZJHSXQ,I really enjoyed this movie. I think that they did an awesome job depicting occurrences/stories from scripture to modern day situations.,1519171200,,136,5.523809523809524
8751990,1,B01BZJHSXQ,"I love a good Christian movie, This.... Not so much. I had not watched a trailer for this, I had not heard of it so I really didn't know what to expect. It just showed up on Pureflix so I gave it a shot.  I had not seen that it on prime while browsing there for some reason so I had not seen a review nor were there any stars to let me know what I was in for so this was an accidental watch with no expectations. I think the movie had potential, that is what kept me going through the acting, some wasn't bad and I have seen far worse in the Christian movie sections.  I kept trudging along, but by the end when I really realized what they had done in actually trying to imitate the bible so closely in a modern day adaptation I was becoming very offended in how it was done.

I think maybe this was intended more for black audiences because it seemed that the whites in the movie were the bad guys in this fantasy land, I started feeling like some of it was racially motivated against whites, something not uncommon in hollywood movies but unexpected here.

 I managed to get through it all but towards the end I would have absolutely hit stop if I would have had to turn down the TV even one more time (by at least half) when the black woman (The bleeder) started yelling (screaming) at the top of her lungs. I have no idea why they didn't tone her down in editing, it was way too much and too often.  At the end it is just like they decided the budget was done and it was time to wrap it up. It felt like they drug 20% of the story through all but the last 5 minutes of the movie and then bombed us with a very, very incomplete 80% in hat last 5 minutes.

Over all the story jumped all over and was very poorly executed in every way. The story line might have been acceptable if at the end you didn't realize it had been a very poor adaptation of the Bible being thrown into modern times. They didn't try to follow the Bibles theme, they tried to replace it completely. Had they followed the storyline loosely and not tried to actually remake factual Biblical history happen in modern times using the idea that these people really were blind Bartimaeus, Barabbas, and even quite offensively Jesus in this modern timeline with Him being followed around by a couple of minions it might have worked.

Even as bad as it was, the way that all at once they ended the story, Jesus was in jail, the Jewish leaders threw him there and the repeat black criminal who was only a criminal because of white people was all at once free in a modern court system because Jesus set him free just killed it the rest of the way in the last few minutes.

As you can see with my review it is even hard to explain this mess and what is bad about it just because of how it was thrown together. Poor editing of the story line, funds ran out so they ended all at once, horrible use of biblical history in a modern timeline where it wouldn't fit. What a mess. I can only assume the good reviews were the actors themselves and some other bogus accounts. Some of you guys could do some acting but get a real story line, a director, and a good editor.....",1515369600,2,3128,4.1570247933884295
