8502643,4,B002NXSRCK,"An absolute MUST for fans of the Blues Cruises. Video quality is just average, sound is good but not great BUT the performances are incredible. Amazing energy and jamming on each and every song. And the artist interviews provide real insight into your favorite performers. My only wish is for future videos from other cruises (the band lineups change somewhat on each cruise) with a high-def Blu-ray release incorporating a lossless surround audio track. One can wish, can't they? Overall a very enjoyable DVD that is highly recommended for any fan of the blues music genre. Keep them coming!",1323561600,,592,4.98989898989899
