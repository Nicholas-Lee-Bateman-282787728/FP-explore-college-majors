2876547,3,B000RXZIQQ,"This documentary was a disappointment. Whereas we are flooded with documentaries about the Third Reich, almost nothing exists about Mussolini's Italy so I welcomed the film. First of all, the ""color"" aspect should be reworded as ""colorized"" which always looks mediocre. But, that's a minor point. Interviews with modern Italian scholars is dealt with clumsily because there is a simultaneous English translation, which is normal, except when it is done elsewhere (and efficiently) the language that is being translated is reduced so that there is no incoherent conflict. Another thing: Mussolini was wildly popular in Italy, including by the working class (and the makers of the film try to spin a Marxist class struggle to the film)---and for good reason. Whether you like it or not, prior to WWII Mussolini accomplished many great things for the country; he improved the lives of Italians (I don't have the space here, but just to name a few: he eradicated the Mafia, he wiped out malaria in Italy) . The Corporate State is completely ignored. As late as 1972, I met Italians who still sang his praises (and they were NOT Fascists!), but who said that his greatest mistake was entering the war. There are also mistakes in the film; e.g., Dr. Mallett claims that the invasion of Ethiopia was done for the purpose of defying the international order. What rubbish! Italy had been humiliated in the previous century by being the only European power to have been defeated by Africans and the Italians ever since had been itching for a rematch. Etc. It should be noted that, unlike the Nazis, the Italian Fascists almost never killed their opponents prior to the civil war. Anyway, I could go on and on, but my point is that one must be historically accurate if one is going to portray history.",1303344000,7,1790,4.872131147540983
2876548,5,B000RXZIQQ,"In trying to educate myself more on the causes of WWII, this DVD has been very very helpful. I didn't know why it mattered that it was 'in color,' until I actually watched it. For some reason black and white feels very distant. A dead body in black and white film and one in color is a different thing. Seeing the old soldiers and their leaders in color was stunning to watch. It made it feel more modern. But all of that aside, this is a very informative DVD and is much more graphic than I expected. They show the footage of the fascists lining up Mussolini's brother and law and friends and shooting them all in the back. There are more dead bodies shown in this film than some can handle probably, but I think it adds to the effect. So that you see the utter horror and madness of that era. I highly recommend this DVD both to educate you and to 'feel' that time period.",1266019200,,874,4.208333333333333
2876549,4,B000RXZIQQ,"I really enjoyed this documentary, and it is a product I recommend. The color isn't bad, all things considered and it allows you to look at the dictator in a new light. I found that their was human emotion in it as well and a greater view for understanding what took plae at this time. I found it fascinating really, to look at the developement and views of the Italian people at this time. A job well done, truely!",1260057600,,415,4.265822784810126
2876550,5,B000RXZIQQ,"There are few DVDs showing the rise of Fascism in Italy, as compared to the multitude showing the rise of Hitler in Germany.
This has been corrected somwhat with the release of this DVD, showing the rise of Mussolini and the Fascists in Italy and how this impacted in Europe, and eventually the world.
In two parts, and in colour, we see the rise and eventual destruction of Fascism in Italy. The colourisation, whilst not in the same league as ""World War 1 in Colour"" does not detract from the subject matter, and complements it.
I knew only a little about Mussolini before I bought this DVD, but I learnt a lot from it. As a history lesson it is terrific.
Recommended for those who have had enough of Hiler and the Nazis, and want to know more about a dictator who has become, over the years, a figure of buffoonery, but at the time seen in a very different light.",1212969600,2,866,4.385093167701863
2876551,5,B000RXZIQQ,"I found this documentary to be a fine overview of the history of Italian fascism, and the rise and fall of Benito Mussolini. Although I don't ordinarily favor colorization, this series of films (including World War One in Color, Russian Revolution in Color, etc.) has done a careful job of it, in terms of accuracy. The effect is striking.",1194048000,9,339,4.762711864406779
2876552,3,B000RXZIQQ,"Very little is available in English on Italian Fascism, unlike the veritable flood of books, films, and memorabilia on Nazi Germany.  This documentary attempts to tell the history of Fascist Italy using color (or colorized) newsreels, still photos, modern shots of historical locations, and reinactments under the narration.  It makes this history more real by interweaving the stories of a few representative people--who they were, what they did, how they shaped or reacted to events--into the larger historical story.

The first section of the DVD concentrates on the rise of the Fascists.  It shows how the fascist movement arose from the turmoil and disillusion in Italy following World War I.  Interestingly, in this section of the film Mussolini is mentioned relatively infrequently.  Instead, the documentary concentrates on local or regional fascist ""bosses"" in the cities, and especially on conditions and events in rural areas, where the fascists battle both socialists/communists as well as Catholic organizations. Among other things, it dramatizes the fascist siege of Parma, in which the fascists were defeated by the armed and organized socialists.  As the film makes clear, the fascists and their sympathizers were never in the majority in post-war Italy, and their rise to power was not inevitable.  It was only because of the collusion of established heirachies--the King of Italy, the Vatican--that the fascist were able to take control. I found this section to be very well done and quite interesting.

Unfortunately, the second section of the DVD, Mussolini in Power, was not nearly as well done as the first.  Whereas the section on the rise to power convered a period of perhaps five years, the section on the fascists in power covered some twenty years in the same amount of time.  Instead of being a history of Italy, it becomes the story of Mussolini (these were not the same thing); and even as the story of Mussolini it is rushed and supperficial, recounting only the main events of his rule.  For the most part, we get little idea of what it was like to live in Italy under the fascists, how the fascists operated once in power, or how they changed Italian society.  The documentary still supplements history by focusing on a few individuals, except in this case the individuals are Mussolini and his son-in-law Count Ciano (though, to be fair, it also does complete the story of one of the characters from the first part).  Count Ciano was chosen not only because his diaries provide an insiders account of Mussolini but also because of the natural drama of the story of Mussolini's relationship with his son-in-law (in the end, Mussolini had him executed at the insistance of the Germans).  But by focusing so tightly on these two men (or three, if you include Hitler), the documentary fails to provide the larger picture and historical background.  For example, it covers the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in just a few minutes, neglecting any discussion of prior Italian colonization in the area, and failing to mention that in 1896 the Italians became the only European nation militarily defeated by the ""third world"" peoples they were attempting to colonize (the Ethiopians, at the Battle of Adowa).  Even in its coverage of Italy in World War II there are many interesting stories that the documentary could have included but does not.  For example, in the first section on the fascist rise to power, we see Italo Balbo commanding the losing fascist troups at the battle for Parma.  I was very much looking forward to how the documentary would deal with Balbo's role in the fascist state, and especially the question of whether on not Mussolini had him assassinated.  However, Balbo is not even mentioned in the second section.

Since this is one of the few documentaries in English that deals with Fascist Italy I hate to not recommend it.  The first section on the rise to power is very well done and worth watching.  As for the second section, you would probably learn as much or more from some of the American TV dramas which were made about Mussolini (in one, he was played by George C. Scott; I think there are two in which he was played by Rod Steiger).  The real value of the second section is that it shows footage of acutal people and historic events, and as such is a supplement to a history of the period such as Bosworth's ""Mussolini's Italy"".",1193961600,32,4390,4.909336941813261

8203059,5,B000RXZIQQ,"For the contents of this film, please read the other reviews. They do a pretty good job describing the documentary. The purpose of me writing this review is not to go over the same material as the others, but to alert people that this is the exact same video footage as the Smithsonian Channel's show Mussolini in Color. I have been looking for this video for a long time. I even sent the Smithsonian Channel an email asking if they were going to release Mussolini in Color (Scourge of Fascism and Sword of Fascism) on DVD any time soon. They never replied and that was about two weeks ago.

On a hunch, I did an online search for the distributor (Cineflix) of the Smithsonian Channel's version and I found out they were connected to this studio distributor (Shanachie). I rolled the dice and bought this version hoping it was the same thing. I was happy to find out that it was the same video footage. There is only one odd difference between the two. The narrators are different. What makes it especially odd is that they say the same exact thing, word for word. This version sounds more British (Bill Paterson narrates) while the Smithsonian Channel's version sounds more American (Stephen Buskin narrates). While I usually enjoy British narration, this is a rare exception. I enjoy listening to the Stephen Buskin narration more. Perhaps my American ears are to blame? Overall, they both do a great job so I wasn't disappointed with the version I purchased - especially since the Buskin narrated version never made it to DVD!

This is the best documentary I have seen so far on Mussolini and Italian Fascism. If you like the period between the two world wars and/or World War II, you will most likely find this documentary interesting and worth your time.
