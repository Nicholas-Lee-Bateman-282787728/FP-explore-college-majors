8130478,5,B000GBEWQG,"I love these Benjamin Bear DVD's and so does my grand-daughter.  They are so-o-o great for pre-schoolers and even grandmothers.  I always have to sit down and watch the adventures of Benjamin Bear and Howie whenever my grandchildren come to visit, so I keep a few handy. They are smart, entertaining and delightful adventures.  My grandchildren all cuddle up and they don't move an inch, especially the three year old. I have to just enjoy with them. They are also very educational, teaching about sharing and caring. Thanks you guys!!!!!!",1236556800,3,539,4.966666666666667
8130479,5,B000GBEWQG,"You may have never heard of Benjamin Bear.  I know my family hadn't, but in the past few days this video has become my daughters favorite.

The Secret World of Benjamin Bear introduces you to the secret lives of Teddy Bears, and their many rules.

Benjamin is mentor to a young Teddy names Howie. (Benjamin looks more than a little like Winne the Pooh).

It's a fun video and the simple plots, with themes of helping and doing your best teaches kids valuable lessons.

Cheers!",1205539200,3,476,4.552941176470588
