8198478,5,B000R32MYW,"Received product on time in condition seller posted.  Glad to know there are still a few sellers out there with Integrity!

I have ordered products through Amazon.con from four of their sellers.  I got ""burned"" by two...Woody Jin (Winter Sonata 6 disc DVD set) and the seller of book (Always Wear Clean Underwear and Other Lessons My Mother Taught Me by Lillian Hinds). Buyers beware of these two sellers.",1233878400,,405,4.840579710144928
