1620921,5,B00005LC5R,"I pride myself on not crying at movies...I usually inwardly console myself, saying that it is 'just a movie' that didn't really happen. This movie left me with no such comfort. I read the Diary about two years ago, and it made me think about how this girl changed the world...and how similar she was to many people I know now. A normal teenager. I thought I would watch this movie when it was on TV, because the book was so spectacular. When I started watching, I got caught up in it, as though I was watching this wonderful documentary. I kept hoping that it wasn't true...that they would change the ending. At 9 o clock the next night, I was a totally different person. I saw the brutality and cruelty inflicted on this smart, kind, and powerful girl. She had mature thoughts which she wrote in her diary about love, life and the world around her. She was treated as an object instead of a person. Taken away from everything which she cared about...especially her father. And she died, 2 weeks before her camp was freed. And as I sat there, watching Ben Kingsley (the only actor who surpassed the power of the actress playing Anne) walk down the streets of Amsterdam after the war, the same street I had seen the night before. Anne was sauntering down the lovely walk way. The streets she peeked at through the window in the secret attic. I started to cry. I couldn't help it. It was just such an injustice that this person had to face this. He was so kind...such a good father and strong of character. Kingsley's powerful eyes made mine cringe with an odd pain. It was so hard to sit through this film of awesome standards. It took you to the places after the diary ends...to the places that we have before only imagined before shutting our eyes and telling ourselves that it wasn't like that. It showed the brutality that we couldn't of imagined. The symbolism was powerful..the reality painful. How could someone inflict such pain on others. Strip them of dignity and kill them? Innocent children, women and men. Take a whole community and lower the population of them by the millions. Ben Kingsley, a normally stunning actor was stunning and ominous all at the same time...such a gentle creature of a character he played that it was so obvious the pain he would have to accept.
This movie takes the startlingly poetic diary of a girl, and turns it into a startling portrail of hatred. When someone who doesn't like to cry out of pride, is brought down to sobs...you have something incredibly powerful.",999129600,3,2507,4.573333333333333
1620922,5,B00005LC5R,"Anne Frank: The Whole Story is a movie that goes beyond what almost all Holocaust stories do. It is touching to the human spirit and how Anne's soul never gave up until the very end. Hannah Taylor Gordon, who was in Jakob the Liar, turns in a superb performance as the Anne Frank. She is able to show us how Anne reacted to everyday life and the inevitable death of her sister, Margot. Ben Kingsley is amazing as Otto Frank, a quiet subdued man who loved his family and was the only one to survive.
The most extraordinary part of this miniseries is the fact that the story keeps on going after they are taking to the Nazi concentration camp. We are seeing the unthinkable horrors and how fortunate we are to have not been a Jew prisoner in that camp. The pain and suffering of Anne and Margot is so well brought up that we feel sorry for these girls with dreams of the future. It is no wonder that this earned an Emmy nomination.",999043200,2,929,4.284090909090909

1620924,4,B00005LC5R,"With the TV miniseries quickly becoming a lost genre, it was a nice surprise to see this much better than average retelling of the Anne Frank Story.  Hannah Taylor Gordon & Ben Kinsley as the central charachter's in this heart wrenching story are quite good but it is Lili Taylor's power-house performance as the Frank Family's confident that steals the show.  There will be the inevidable comparison the the Oscar winning film, this production is better, with the exception of Brenda Blythe who can't hold a candle to Shelley Winters.
ABC & Disney shouls be very proud of this fine production which should be mandatory viewing for evey person over the age of 11.",996624000,3,663,4.807017543859649
1620925,5,B00005LC5R,"I found this miniseries to be one fo the most powerful Holocaust movies I have ever seen, and having myself just read the definitive edition of the diary, found such honest and revealing details of Anne's life to be both insightful and moving.  With the original broadcast airing the concentration camp scenes without commerical interruption, I was glad to see the seriousness ABC/Disney took with its subject matter.

1620969,3,B00005LC5R,"I didn't care for this version of the Anne Frank story as much as I did the first time I saw it.  The Anne Frank Foundation protested this movie for some reason and refused to allow any actual excerpts from Anne's diary to be used in the script.  Why?  Who knows because the movie was very respectful.  The movie is handsomely made and Ben Kingsley is the quietly heroic Otto Frank who never gets flustered, never shows any doubts.  The actress playing Anne did well and of course is carrying most of the movie.  I found though that the movie took too long to develop the story.  The section of the movie which deals with the family's imprisonment and Anne and Margot perishing in the hell of Bergen Belsen is difficult to watch and terribly grim.  I'm not sure if it really adds to the Anne Frank story and perhaps that's why the Foundation objected to the making of the movie.  The horrors that awaited the Frank family were probably better left totally to the viewer's imagination.  That's where the film and stage versions of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" left the story, with the Nazis pounding on the door of the Annex.  When audience saw the original play production that scene left much of the audience moaning with grief.",1474934400,,1226,4.527272727272727

I do remember her telling me about some  horrific details that horrified her. This book had a great impact on her as I think it would anyone whom reads it. I donated most all her books to the local library in her memory, I believe this was one of them.

1621044,5,B00005LC5R,"Part Two

The actress, Hannah Gordon plays Anne, the actor Ben Kingsley plays Otto Frank.

The Frank family along with another family of three go into hiding in a secret annex of a building.  Later a dentist joins them.  They receive help from the people who work with Otto Frank.  Tensions run high between the two families.  They have a radio and hear news from the outside world about the armies and the battles they are fighting.  The younger daughter Anne continues her diary and it is thru her eyes she relates the war story in hiding.  She forms a friendship with Peter, the boy from the other family.  He is older than her.  The gestapo finds the families living in the secret annex,  and deports them to concentration camps.

The movie goes beyond Anne's diary which was left in the attic.  Sequences follow the sisters and the mother to different concentration camps, Westerbrok, Aushwitz-Bierknau, and Bergen Belsen.  The acting of Anne in the camps is superb.  The depiction of the life in the camps is portrayed gruesome as actually was.  Many die of starvation and diseases, and others are sent to the gas chambers.

Anne's  diary is found by Miep, a woman who helps them during the war.  She had hoped to return it to her when the war was over.  She gives it to her father instead, upon his return.  At the ending of this movie, I was crying.  Otto Frank stands alone while he learns the fate of his wife, and later his two daughters.  He survives so much sorrow, and goes on to live a long life.",1407542400,,1511,4.4944649446494465

1621046,1,B00005LC5R,"I purchased the movie ""Used but advertised as in ""VERY GOOD"" condition. In fact the movie came with a huge scratch in the middle of the disc. This scratch was so significant it made the movie a true chore to get through with constant stops and then restarts after a few moments. What made this particularly annoying was the fact the movie was ""Wonderful"" and I highly recommend it and you don't mind a few tears as you get into the story. This of course made the stoppages that much more troubling.

I know that when you buy something used you are taking a risk. HOWEVER, when it is advertised as being in ""very good"" condition one would expect to at least be able to watch the movie uninterrupted.

I was wrong.  This part was as dark and graphic as the earlier parts of the movie were light, depicting life in Holland before the family hid in the attic and then during the hiding.

First of all, the casting in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anne-Frank-The-Whole-Story/dp/B00005LC5R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anne Frank - The Whole Story</a>&nbsp;is EXCELLENT and one (of several) best things about this film.

Ben Kingsley (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gandhi/dp/B00190N4E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gandhi</a>&nbsp;fame) and Hannah Taylor-Gordon are OUTSTANDING as Otto Frank & Anne Frank, as is Lili Taylor as the loyal & dependable Miep Gies. The actors & actresses of ALL the other characters -- both the main characters (Edith Frank, Margot Frank, the van Pels family [Auguste, Hermann & Peter van Pels], Fritz Pfeffer) as well as the supporting characters (Bep Voskuijl, Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, Charlotta Kaletta, Jacqueline van Maarsen, the Goslar family [Hans, Ruth, Hannah & Gabi Goslar], Janny Brandes & her sister Lientje, etc.) are also ALL just PERFECT in their respective roles!

Best of all, UNLIKE the other Anne Frank movies (as well as the theatrical plays) this film goes WAY, WAY BEYOND those in its exploration of Anne and her life, and surpasses what everyone already knows about about the famous young diarist.

This film NOT ONLY shows Anne's life during the 25 months she spent hiding in the ""Secret Annexe"" (like all the other films & plays do) but it goes EVEN DEEPER not only by showing her life in the months/years before going into hiding, but also by following Anne & the other residents of the ""Secret Annexe"" to the concentration camps/death camps after they were betrayed by an unknown individual (though this film shows one speculation -- that it was Lena van Bladeren-Hartog, the building's cleaning-woman & wife of Lammert Hartog, the warehouse foreman) and captured by the Nazis.

1621067,2,B00005LC5R,"One would think a story of this magnitude would inspire better acting, as well as better directing and screenplay.  While Kingsley and Taylor-Gordon shine as Otto and Anne Frank, all the other actor's performances were mediocre at best, and leave the viewer with little empathy for the characters when taken in the abstract.  Lili Taylor as Miep Gies was particularly disappointing.  They could have and should have cast a far better actor to play such a pivotal role.

Spoilers Ahead

There is very little tension regarding the serious and eminent threat of danger these people faced.  The Frank family and the others hiding with them were under a constant, looming threat of being discovered, which increased as their months in hiding dragged on, yet little of this is depicted here.  A thief suspects that people are hiding after he discovers a dropped wallet, but he is so unconvincing that you still don't get the sense that something might go wrong with their plan.  The thief later tries to break into the building, but runs away when he sees a flashlight beam from one of the refugees, and a German officer who had been on patrol takes only a cursory glance inside the building.  That is as ""edge-of-your-seat"" as it gets.  You almost forget their very lives hung in the balance.

Throughout the film there is very little sense of urgency, or of food or clothing shortages.  The worst injustice anyone seems to suffer is Mrs. van Pels being forced to sell an expensive mink stole.  Instead the film focuses much more on the numerous petty squabbles between characters, which never seem to compound what should be extreme tension in the air.  It's as if there's no atmosphere.  The insignificant use of amenities such as the bathroom, or the desk Anne used for writing, coveted also by Fritz Pfeffer (aka Albert Dussel), is a main focal point as well.

After being discovered and sent to work/concentration camps, several of the group become sick with scabies, typhoid fever, malnourishment, etc.  The makeup depicting these afflictions is so bad it looks like something directly out of Night Of The Dead, or even Rocky Horror Picture Show.

Overall the movie isn't terrible, it's just not very good, either.  It was made for television, and that flaw shows in every aspect. It has no gravitas whatsoever. I don't know how much of a hand Disney played in its making, but their signature Disneyfying (making lame) of the intensity this subject deserves looks like it's everywhere in this film.",1350864000,,2499,4.865248226950355

1621070,5,B00005LC5R,"This is a Disney version of an Anne Frank biography. But it's a totally straight telling -- not ""Disney-fied"" in the slightest. It tells the familiar story of Anne's life as covered by the diary (a tiny bit of ""normal"" life but primarily the life of her, her family, and four other people for two years while they were hidden in an apartment above Mr. Frank's offices). But it also gives insights into things that the diary doesn't cover, including going's on in the outside world while the Franks were in the hideaway, speculation about who turned them in, and, most movingly, the story of what happened to Anne and her fellow Annex residents after they were captured.

Frankly, if your primary interest is the part of the story that takes place inside the Annex, I think I'd recommend the BBC/Masterpiece Theater version (which is based on Anne's diary). While the casting in the Disney version is good, I thought the characters were a little stronger in the BBC version.

But if you want to get the broader context, this is the one for you. The speculations about who betrayed them are interesting. (Suspicion fell on three people after the war but the case was never proven against any of them.) You also get more information in this movie about what was going on in the outside lives of Miep and their other ""helpers,"" and a few updates on what was happening with Anne's friends.

But the real strength of this movie is the part of the story that happens after their arrest. The stories of life in the camps focuses on Anne, her sister, and mother, and it's one of the most moving pieces of film-making I've ever seen. I recently showed it to a class of high school freshmen who had just finished reading the book, and I've never shown a movie that captured the fuller attention of a roomful of teenagers.",1325980800,,1810,4.580246913580247

What I like about the movie, is that it shows the life of the Franks before going into hiding...then their lives in hiding....then goes on further to show life in the concentration camps and ending with Mr. Frank returning to Mieps to look for his girls.  I didn't like the actor that portrayed Peter, just because he didn't look like what I expected.  There is a brief nudity scene in the concentration camps, but Anne looked so starved and unlike herself, that my kids were questioning if she was really starving.

I decided to watch, and was pleasantly surprised to see they kept to the original story.
  The actors are VERY believeable.  After awhile I had to remind myself, that's NOT the real Anne and Margot, but They both did a BEAUTIFUL job. I never was able to get into the Millie Perkins version.  If you don't look the part, how can you be the part?
  The latter part of this movie is heartwrenching...  Anne being torn away from her father and when Margot dies are equally heartbreaking to watch.  Those two scenes could be scary for little ones.

However, while I watched this, I felt like I was part of their world. I was able to see how carefree Anne was, hanging out with her friends, going to school, just being an every day schoolgirl. The movie is a little over three hours, and divided roughly into three parts, pre-hiding, during hiding, and post-hiding. While all other versions begin the movie with the family going into the secret Annex, and ending with the Nazi's finding them, this went above and beyond. I will not deny the fact that during the whole last hour, I was crying. To see what those poor people went through, just because they were Jewish. It is a movie every person should see. The character of Anne was shown how Anne herself described herself to be, talkative, annoying, and bratty. My boyfriend whom I watched it with kept repeating, she is so annoying. How could she be so annoying? Which I felt was good, because that is how she was, or so she says. Not to mention the actor playing Mr. Frank looked so much like the real Mr. Frank it was uncanny. During the scenes of discovery, you are so drawn in, that you are hoping there is an alternate ending. However, this is real life and there is no alternative ending.",1240012800,6,1455,4.473684210526316
1621091,5,B00005LC5R,"This movie was extremely well done from beginning to end.  Sir Ben Kingsley and Hannah Gordon were splendid in their roles.

The movie progresses quite well.  We see Anne living a somewhat normal life -- living in a comfortable home, first crush, friends, school -- despite her family's Jewish faith.  Slowly, things are being taken away from them ... Anne has to leave her regular school and go to a Jewish school, Anne can no longer be friends with another girl because the other girl's Aryan family is anti-semitic, and now it is mandatory that all Jews wear the Star of David on their clothing.  And quite often, Jews are being rounded up and sent away.  A powerful scene is one in which Anne's teacher starts to sob and can no longer write on the chalkboard -- his wife was just taken away to a labor camp.  One day, the Franks receive a summons for Anne's sister Margot, and Otto decides that his family will hide.  Anne must now leave her home, school, pet, and friends in order to survive The Holocaust.

The Franks offer aid to a few select people -- the Van Pels family (one of which is a young boy a couple of years older than Anne, Peter), and Mr. Pfeffer (a friend of the family), rounding out the whole party to eight people.

We see the time pass in The Annex, and tensions rise amongst the adults.  Personalities clash, and mingle as Peter and Anne fall in love.  Everything is portrayed very believably as Anne, a naive young girl at first, goes from hating Peter to caring for him very much.  Miep and Jans are portrayed as the caring people they were described as being in real life.

Inevitably, the SS arrives for the Frank family based on an anonymous tip.  There is a moment where the SS officer spots Otto's trunk and discovers that Otto was an officer for Germany in WWI.  The SS officer salutes Otto out of respect and allows Otto more time to pack, inquiring why he didn't register as a veteran so that he could have received preferable treatment.  Otto says nothing, but looks at his family ... the meaning is understood.  They are forcibly removed from the Annex and sent to a labor camp, where they are treated as criminals because they hid. Anne assists the teacher in the labor camp school by telling stories to the children.  In one scene, the teacher gives all the children their report cards before they board a train that is supposedly going to another labor camp.  Given  the age of these young children, it is inevitable they are headed to an extermination camp ... but the teacher kindly asks them to make sure they give their report cards to their next teacher, to spare the children any fear. A sad scene.

The Franks end up at Auschwitz-Birkenau ... the final stop for many Jews.  There, the party of eight is divided forever -- with the men going one way, the women another.  Margot and Anne end up at Bergen-Belsen, a camp known for its horrible conditions: filth, squalor, starvation, and sickness.  We see Anne suffer,  her naive beliefs she held at the beginning gone forever as she witnesses extreme desperation and death.  Soon, she herself becomes desperate in order to survive and protect her sister.  She learns of her mother's death from Mrs. Van Pels.

At the very end, we see Otto arrive at a Red Cross location, desperate for any news on his family.  He is informed by a Bergen-Belsen survivor of their fate.  He arrives at the office to inform Miep and gives a description of the destinies of the other occupants of the Annex ... in a voice clearly exhausted with grief and shock.  He is the only survivor.  At a historical moment, Miep presents him with the pages to Anne's diary ....

The two main characters, really, are Otto and Anne.  Pim and Anne adored each other ... and when they are torn out of each other's arms it's the other they cry out for.  At the end, Otto's love for Anne is what leads to the diary's being published.  And it's a great thing that it was -- it's a piece of art.

1621096,5,B00005LC5R,"Anne Frank - The Whole Story

""Anne Frank - the Whole Story"" is a well-acted and beautifully filmed movie based on Melissa Muller's biography of Anne Frank. It basically recounts how the Frank family comprising father Otto, mother Edith and daughters Margot and Anne chose to go into hiding in Amsterdam after the Nazis stepped up their persecution of Jews [and Margot got a summons for deportation].Their hiding place is a secret annex located in the factory run by Otto Frank. The Franks' trusted Gentile friends help them and soon the hiding place is opened to accommodate the Van Pels' [husband, wife and teen son, Peter] and a dentist, Mr Pfeffer. The Jewish refugees spend about 2 yrs in hiding, from July 1942 till Aug 1944 [when they were betrayed].

This was a difficult movie to watch because I was already familiar with Anne's story [having read ""Diary of a Young Girl"" more than two decades ago] and knew what happened to Anne, her family and the rest of the hidden Jews. The movie was beautifully filmed with great attention to period details and the excellent casting choices made this the best movie on Anne Frank I've ever watched.

Ben Kingsley is very credible as Otto Frank, the stoic WW I German veteran who is initially optimistic that the war will soon end. His intense bond and love for Anne is very real in this movie, as is his portrayal of  a protective family man who is determined to keep his family together, no matter what. Hannah Taylor-Gordon plays Anne Frank, and her resemblance to the real-life Anne is quite uncanny. Her portrayal of Anne is simply amazing - strong-willed, impetuous, candid, ambitious, and yet, underlying all that fierceness of spirit is a young girl on the brink of womanhood who yearns to be thought of as a woman and not a girl, and longs for freedom and love. When I read ""Diary of a Young Girl"", I always had a picture of Anne in my  mind and thought that Hannah Taylor Gordon played the role flawlessly.

The supporting cast is also well-played - Tatjana Blacher plays the role of Edith Frank , the unassuming mother who has an abrasive relationship with Anne[ who feels her mother doesn't understand her] yet loves her daughters very much. The loud and aggressive Auguste Van Pels is played to perfection by Brenda Blethyn and her husband, Hermann is credibly portrayed by Joachim Krol. Jessica Manley plays Margot Frank with a quiet calmness that is tinged with sensitivity.

The ""Righteous Gentiles"", those who helped Anne and her family throughout their hiding are well-portrayed as well, especially Lili Taylor as the courageous and devoted Miep Gies.

The narration of the story flows smoothly from Anne's joyful childhood at the beginning of the movie to the fearful period when the Nazis invade and later start their persecution of the Dutch Jews to the awkwardness of the people in hiding [all the tensions between individuals who are forced to live in close quarters], and finally to their betrayal, arrest and deportation. The scenes in the camp are horrific [caution: there are scenes of female nudity] and the squalor in which Anne, Margot and Edith find themselves after being deported to Auschwitz [from the transit camp Westerbork] is terrible to watch. Margot and Anne are later transported to Bergen-Belsen, where conditions are inhuman - starvation is never ceasing, diseases are rampant and hope is dim.

What stayed with me at the end of the movie was the final dialogue between Anne and Margot, where they struggle to remember their hopes and dreams that they once had, trying to imagine a life after the war and how those hopes would remain unfulfilled. It is a tragic testament to all those innocent lives that were lost during the Holocaust - the stolen childhoods, the lost innocence, dashed dreams and of the 1.5 million children who were silenced forever.

1621100,5,B00005LC5R,"The combination of outstanding acting and material from many sources provides a moving, sometimes horrifying, often warm picture of not only Anne Frank but the love and dedication which sustained many during the horrors of the Holocaust. Normally, the very thought of the time and place is enough to make one shudder, and to envision a world of pure evil and hatred. Though there is no gloss on that aspect, and the concentration camp scenes do not minimise the horror, the mutual caring of those in the Annexe and those who assist them (despite huge danger) provides a balance which can restore a picture of the essential goodness of human nature which even the worst conditions do not always destroy.

Though I have not read the particular biography on which this adaptation is based, I had previously seen interviews with those who knew Anne and her family, and memories of theirs are cleverly interwoven into the early sequences. Anne's portrait is frank and largely amusing, and the subtle recognition of how anti-Jewish measures in Amsterdam slowly stripped Jews of rights is well depicted. The gradual restrictions, at first bothersome but not horrid, are a keen reminder both of how respected neighbours can be reduced to outcasts, and, tellingly, of how those such as Otto Frank could initially have felt safe in Amsterdam.

Seeing Anne with friends, at school, in her lovely flat, and at Otto's office makes the impact of the hiding and constant fright understandable - I felt claustrophobic and trapped just watching the relatively peaceful days in the Annexe. Anne's reflections, based on her diary, will strike a chord with anyone. The hatred surrounding her from the invaders is clear, but the other struggles are those all of us face as we come to maturity, and the limited picture one normally could have from having 'seen' only the time in hiding can turn Anne into a monument rather than a cheeky, inspired, boy obsessed, intelligent teenager.

There are times when even brief lines capture a great deal. For example, when Otto Frank, in response to Anne's overall bitterness towards all Germans, reminds her both that the Franks are German and that protector Miep is Austrian (just like Hitler), it is a strong reminder of how coming to maturity means broadening perspective.

The scenes in the concentration camp do not spare the viewer the horror of the reality. Anne's screaming for her father; the tragic sequence when women, stripped of clothes and hair, try to cover themselves to maintain dignity; the utter cruelty of the female who tells Anne the men are already gassed as she tattoos Anne's arm with her identification number, all would cause one to wonder what sort of hatred could lead to so degrading others, even before we see or hear of anyone's dying. Camera angles which capture the chimneys of Auschwitz show us, all too well, the awareness of death with which the prisoners lived at each moment.

I believe that this film is enriching and enlightening, however painful the camp sequences are (and well they should be). My only caution for classroom use is that students need to have previous awareness of the history of the era, and have already braced themselves for scenes of the horror of the camps. Those who have only small familiarity with Anne's diary, which naturally chronicles no nightmarish events, could be very shocked otherwise.",1218499200,2,3380,4.954144620811287

This is, after all, a Disney film.

Would I use it in the classroom?  Probably not, because of (brief) bare breasts in the concentration camp, and because the teleplay by Kirk Ellis [""The Three Stooges"" (2000)] plods toward the inevitable without capturing the irrepressible spirit that the unfinished diary leads us to believe ought to be there.

You feel as if you get a full picture of her life.  The acting was superb, especially Hannah Taylor Gordon as Anne and Ben Kingsley as Otto Frank.  This film makes you feel as though you really got to know Anne, which makes the all too familiar ending that much more heartbreaking.  I was fortunate enough to have been able to visit The Anne Frank House Museum and the Secret Annex in Amsterdam, and the film really brought me back to that place.

This appears to be a lot longer than the first movie and goes into much more detail after the capture.  The harsh nature of the concentration camps after the capture makes this difficult to watch at times.  Kingsley is superb as the father, Otto Frank.  The girl playing Anne Frank is absolutely wonderful too and even looks somewhat like Anne Frank's pictures.  All the cast was excellent.  I liked the original movie, but this is so much better.  I don't know how much was factual, but having seen the Anne Frank house in Amsterdam, I have to say that they really did seem to accurately depict what it looked like; probably made a replica or even possibly filmed it there on site.  The only inaccuracy that I picked up was that they showed who betrayed the Franks; however, that has never been determined with any certainty.  It is a mystery to this day.  The movie feels like it drags on and on and it is a bit slow in places.  It is probably best watched in two parts.  In spite of any minor shortcomings, this is a 5-star movie.  Bring your box of hankies.  It is highly emotional and very sad at the end.  Holocaust deniers should be forced to sit through this movie over and over again, as well as visit some of the still remaining camps.  I visited Dachau last year and seeing it has a profound impact on a person.  Anne Frank reminds us how brutal things can be for the innocent in a war.  I wouldn't watch this with sensitive young children, as it might be too upsetting for them.  I think you will be moved by this film and it should be a part of everyone's film library.

Along with Anne, we also have the opportunity to know the other residents in the Secret Annex, who up until now where little more than caricatures.  Most noteworthy is her mother Edith of whom little was known about.  We see Edith as a woman who lived for her family.  Unfortunately, her husband is not in love with her and Anne constantly rejects her.  For Edith represents a life as Anne states, ""is like being in prison"".  One of the most heart wrenching scenes is at Auschwitz when Edith is informed that her daughters were part of a random selection.  The remnants of Edith's world have just collapsed and she gives a wail that comes from the deepest part of her soul.  I am brought to tears each time I see this. I highly recommend this film.

Seeing Ben Kingsley's name on the credits brought me hope that his inclusion would enhance the film...but I was not prepared for the stunning, moving, and totally compelling piece of movie making i was to see. I must admit my heart sank, when I read it was a Disney production, but full marks to them for such an undertaking, so magnifically produced.

The locations and scenery were totally believable from Anne's flawless descriptions, and the acting from all concerned totally breathtaking. The way that clips from original war scenes were included only served to enhance the belief that one was living it as in a documentary.

The young actress , playing Anne, only fourteen years old, but bringing out a stunning performance that belied her young age. Hannah Taylor - Gordon gave her all in a range of emotions that showed Anne to be a normal teenage girl, with all her doubts, fears, dreams and intentions placed in a totally restrictive situation, as when in hiding, and in adesperate savage situation as when in the concentration camps...she deserves total praise for her role.

Her totally devoted father..Ben Kingsley, played his part as the middle class, reserved  parent with total professionalism..his breaking down at the end of the film, was heartwrenching. Anne's slightly repressed mother..always doing the ""right thing"", was splendidly portrayed by Brenda Blethyn..and all the other characters played their parts so believably.

The film follows the story of anne , from her carefree days, with her school friends to the bitter end..and I cannot say I have seen a film that moved me so much, in all my 56 years.

Like many, I read this book as a young girl and was immediately saddened by Anne's story.  Seeing in graphic detail how a well-adjusted and endearing teenage girl deals with the horrors of persecution as her family is forced into hiding to avoid the Nazi terror cannot fail to engage the heart and mind. It shows Anne before the Nazi invasion of Holland as a bubbling girl eager for education and socialisation. Her indomitable spirit is well portrayed during her family's long months of hiding in the back of a factory in Amsterdam.  For me, the virtual incarceration of her family in the factory was very sad and thought-provoking. Taken from their normal lives and stripped of all those things they held dear, Anne's family strives to remain positive of better times ahead. How would we fare if required to give up all that we possessed and go into hiding for fear of our lives? A totally depressing thought, and yet that is what happened to Anne and her family.

The later scenes, after the family was captured, humiliated, separated and sent to concentration camps, is simply tragic.  The concentration camp scenes are disturbing and Anne's gradual physical deterioration is depressing. It is not a movie to entertain but one to stir the emotions and the resolve to ensure that this sort of persecution and genocide is never again allowed to happen.

At the very end of this movie we are presented with the following words:

""One and a half million children were murdered in the genocide the Nazis called `The Final Solution.'  Anne Frank's story is only one of them.""  (The Nazis' final solution was to exterminate the Jews.)

And what a story it is!  The story is well told through this movie.

At the beginning of this movie we are presented with the following words (information in parentheses is my own additional information):

(i) This movie is based on the book by Melissa Muller called ""Anne Frank: A Biography"" (1998) as well as research and interviews by an independent researcher.  (I have not read this book but from what I have read, it is excellently researched.)

(ii) Some scenes can also be found in ""Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl.""  Note that the actual words from the diary were not used.  (The first diary entry is for mid-June, 1942 and the last one is dated (August 1, 1944).  It is also helpful to know that Anne was born June 12, 1929.)

(iii) There are realistic depictions of concentration camp life--including brief nudity.

The actual movie itself can be divided into four parts:

(1) The time before the German-Jewish Anne Frank (Hannah Taylor-Gordon) and her family go into hiding.  The movie begins Feb., 1939 in Amsterdam, Holland.  Some of this is based on the ten diary entries Anne made before she went into hiding.  (This part of the movie lasts about 55 minutes.)

(2) The time the Frank family of four, another family of three, and an elderly dentist went into hiding in the ""het achterbuis"" which, loosely translated, means ""secret annex"" of an old three-story building.  This part of the movie begins in mid-Nov., 1942 when the elderly dentist joins the two families that have been hiding since early July, 1942.  We are also introduced to the four people who aided the hiding group of eight especially a young women named Miep (Lili Taylor).  There is also some speculation of exactly who betrayed the hiding group.  (Note that this has never been proven.)  This part ends with the group of eight being discovered by the Nazis secret police (Gestapo) and being taken away on Aug. 4, 1944.  (Lasts for about 75 minutes.)

(3) This part of the movie portrays what happened to Anne after the group was discovered.  It ends with the viewer being taken to Amsterdam in 1945, one month after the German surrender. (Lasts about 55 minutes.)

(4) The movie ends with the printed word.  In this part we get snippets of important printed information.  For example:

""In 1957, Otto Frank [Anne's father, played in the movie by Ben Kingsley] established the Anne Frank Foundation, working to educate young people against intolerance and discrimination.""

Another example is the quoted information that begins this review.  (Lasts about 3 minutes.)

What makes this movie so powerful is the contrasts we see in each part.  Part one presents the free, happy Anne; part two, the hiding, hoping Anne; and part three, the fearful, prisoner Anne.

Note that this movie has not been sanctioned by the Anne Frank Foundation.  Personally, I can't understand why because it seems to follow rather closely everything I've read.

The acting in this movie is fantastic.  Kudos should go to Hannah Taylor-Gordon who essentially carries the movie as Anne.

The background music adds to each scene and even the cinematography is well done.

If you haven't actually read Anne's diary, I urge you to do so.  I recommend the 1993 Bantam edition that not only contains the actual diary but also information that puts Anne's diary in historical context and, as well, has pictures that illuminate the diary.

Finally, the DVD itself is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are no extras.

In conclusion, this is a powerful movie, a worthy companion to Anne Frank's diary!!

I also wanted to show them how quickly that freedom could be lost if we were under any other sort of government.  I was not disappointed. After only a few minutes into this movie, the children were entranced.  It is such a ""real life"" drama!  The acting is incredible and the story line, well it sticks quite well to the facts of that time period, according to what i've been taught. It has a few minutes of documentary after the movie about the ""real"" Anne Frank and her family. It was amazing just how close to the character the actress actually looked and acted, according to that information! This movie is definitely too emotional for a small child, but my children are in the 6th grade and after a brief talk about what to expect; the deaths, the hatred, the starvation, I felt it was quite appropriate for their age group.  It would, no doubt, be up to the parent to judge the maturity of the viewer because while watching this movie you feel as though you really ""meet"" Anne Frank and then you watch the suffering that the Jews, including Anne's family, endured.

 The movie tells about a 13 year old Jewish girl living in Holland between 1939 and 1945. The girl's name is Anne Frank. Her nearly perfect world is shattered when the Nazis invade her country and she, along with her mother, father, and older sister, Margot are forced to go into hiding to avoid deportion to concentration camps.

  Anne and her family are joined by 4 other Jews under the same circumstances and together live in a cramped attic for two long years. During those years Anne keeps a diary.

 The film is beautifully made and is a must see for anybody interested in WWII. It is emotionally heart-wrenching but has some humor parts.

 Due to nudity ( womens rears and chests exposed) and brief violence including disterbing images, I would suggest parents watch this movie with their children to help explain some of these difficult issues.

To begin with, Anne and the other members of the Secret Annex look so much like they must have in real life - and the acting is so well done that it's almost easy to forget that these ARE just actors! Anne's multifaceted personality is portrayed very realistically (as a teenage girl, I believe I have the experience to say that), and Ben Kingsley's performance as Otto Frank is heartbreaking. The first time I saw this movie, in fact, I was almost too shocked to cry. Everyone knows the tragic story of the Holocaust, but for once the facts were truly humanized on a personal level.

The events in this film are very well laid out, too. It's important to get to know the Frank family in their happier years before they went into hiding, and of course Anne's story does not end at her arrest. I would DEFINITELY recommend this movie to all mature audiences: Anne Frank fans, World War II buffs, history teachers and classrooms, and anyone who has the slightest interest in realizing the state of the world only sixty years ago.",1102464000,8,1237,4.592760180995475

It is the story of an outwardly ordinary schoolgirl, whose  aspirations of womanhood cruelly denied her by the brutal effects of the

dying Nazi regime.

This splendid film shows how the girl used her writing as a means of self expression, and as a fom of escapism, only to be captured by the Nazi's, and spend her last days in a desperate struggle for salvation. The setting of the family attic is broken by the brutal scenes at the concentration camps, culminating in Otto Franks return to Amsterdam after the war, to discover the truth about his two daughters, and to discover Anne's diary.

Ben Kingsley gives a dignified portrayal of Otto Frank, the man who strives throughout to keep his family together. It is this message of family values which shines through the film to the end. Moving, and near the end, harrowing drama.",1101081600,7,1068,4.725806451612903
1621168,5,B00005LC5R,"I wholeheartedly agree with the majority of reviewers that this is the best account of Anne's life ever made - and one of the best holocaust movies ever made as well.
The acting is top-notch and Hannah Taylor Gordon is a real find -it is amazing how she is able to bring Anne's character to life.
The only thing that could theoretically be improved upon is to do the movie in the language(s) used in the real events - that is, mostly Dutch. As a Dutchman, I may seem prejudiced in favour of my own language but that's not it.
Dutch movies that portray 'international' events or persons almost always use the appropriate language(s) even if that results in a multilingual movie. To me, the story becomes less believable if Dutch and German characters are speaking English to each other, or if they have an unconvincing accent.
The same thing bugged me when I watched ""The Discovery Of Heaven"", which is also mostly set in the Netherlands.
Anyway, this is all hypothetical because: a) I see that a movie in Dutch would probably not be competitive internationally so it could never be made with a similar budget; and b) that would mean that the great cast used in this movie wouldn't have been in it.
So I'm not really complaining; even if some aspect could theoretically be improved upon (at least according to my personal taste and preferences), it remains, in practice, one of the best ever made in its genre, and a must see for anyone seriously interested in that horrible episode in human history.",1088294400,2,1499,4.639097744360902

I think Hannah Taylor Gordon was such a good look-alike to Anne Frank and played her part so well; if the real Anne Frank were still alive, you could put the two girls side by side and they'd look so alike.",1082678400,2,501,4.397849462365591
1621172,5,B00005LC5R,"As i write this review, this film is just finishing up, and I must say, this is one of the most moving accounts of Anne Frank that I've seen to date. We all know the story of Anne Frank, how it started, and what a complete tragic end of her life; and more importantly, what hope she brought to the world that killed her. This film is a remarkable, incredible retelling of the life of Anne Frank.
The reasons why this film soars, aboslutely soars, are numerous. First, the film tells the complete story, from before the Franks hid in the Annex, until her final days in the concentration camp. Whereas some films tend to linger solely on Anne's days in the Annex, this wider focus gives us the larger picture. Anne's time in captivity is heart wrenching; we have fallen in love with the tempestuous, darling girl and to see her solely fade away is devastating. It serves as a testament both to the millions lost, and the one girl that would write a book to change the world.
Secondly, the performances in this movie are amazing. Ben Kingsley and Brenda Blethyn lend their star-stature names to this project, and turn in performances that are real and dignified. Favorite Lili Taylor, who is one of America's most talented actressses, gives a quiet, powerful performance as Miep Gies. It's Hannah Taylor Gorden, as Anne, brings Anne to life with complexity and grace. Gordon honors Anne in every scene, never deifying the girl, but making her real, human. She even writes the way Anne did, holding the pen as Anne would have held it. That attention to detail does not go unnoticed by those of us who love Anne. It was a perfect match of actress and role.
Third, this film is visually beautiful. Often, you expect a ""lower"" standard of technical excellence in a television film. Rightfully so, ABC and the director, Robert Dornhelm, give this film a professional style. There are several scenes where you are just in awe, apart from the incredible story.
It was sad for me to learn that this film was not endorsed by the Anne Frank Foundation, because the film was based on a biography not approved by the foundation. Whereas I think its important to have the Foundation so Anne's life can be told in a honest way, they should have seen the film before making a judgment. This movie is a beautiful testament to a beautiful life, and it should be free from any political wranglings like this.
By the final scene, when Miep gives Otto Frank his daughter's diary, and he travels back into the Annex to look at it, my heart was breaking. Anne didn't live to see the effect she'd have on the world, but I think for all of us, we have adopted Anne as our own daughter or sister. She belongs to the world now, and we are responsible to take care of her, to make sure her story is told generation after generation, to honor her life by ensuring nothing like this ever happens in history again.",1082246400,200,2881,4.531669865642995

If you read just the Diary of Anne Frank, you are left to wonder, If you have read Anne Frank; Diary of a young girl, you get to find out what happened after, but seeing it in motion picture form was something else.  What struck me is how similar the girl playing anne looked to the real anne.  I can watch this movie over and over.  The best adaption from book I have ever seen.",1079654400,,555,3.954954954954955

It took me two evenings to view the the first 1/2 or so of Anne Frank because it seemed to move ever so slowly. What I didn't realize at the time was that the film producers were apparently making sure that the characters were solidly etched in my mind because their later interactions would be critical to fully understanding and appreciating this film.
From the time Anne and her family were finally discovered in their hide-out by the Nazis, the movie was not to be left unfinished again! This later part of the film, which I would estimate at 90-minutes, was probably the best 90-minutes of film I'd ever seen. Hannah Taylor Gordon's (Anne) and Ben Kingsley's (Anne's father, Otto) acting abilities, along with the great movie sets, make this film so realistic, gut-wrenching, and believable.
Bottom line, one of the best films on the Holocaust you'll ever see. Easily stacks-up to Shindler's List. Also, for a simulation of life at a Nazi concentration camp, the Anne Frank film is #1.",1009584000,,1204,4.76555023923445

1621182,5,B00005LC5R,"I loved the film, ANNE FRANK - THE WHOLE STORY so much! I saw it when it aired on ABC and thought it was one of the most beautiful, heartwarming pieces of filmmaking in movie history. This story was about a real girl - Anne Frank - who was a Jewish girl growing up during the Holocaust, one of the most terrible, unthinkable tragedies in history. It was very accurate, considering the fact that I read Melissa Miller's novel right after viewing the film. This is a film Disney and ABC should be proud of! Everyone must see this film...it will change your life and way of thinking forever! The DVD or VHS must be on the shelf in every family's house. The acting performances are absolutely superb and some of the best I've ever seen. Hannah Taylor-Gordon is inspirational and gives an Oscar-winning performance, forget the Emmy Award! If only this had been shown in the theaters. Taylor-Gordon is exactly how I'd picture Anne Frank to be on screen. She is a true teen idol for teenage girls out there - forget those teen ""Pop princesses""...they don't even come close to Hannah Taylor-Gordon! Ben Kingsley is in his best performance yet. And Lili Taylor...what more can I say about her? She is one of those rare, extremely talented actresses, but so underrated. She also deserves an Emmy! The whole cast is superb, like I said before. Oh, and also, to that reviewer who was wondering who played Peter van Pels, it's Nick Audsley. Another truly amazing actor. And I also agree that his chemistry with Hannah Taylor-Gordon in the film was perfect! This is a film of horrifying reality. It is also one of those rare films that made me cry at the ending. I cannot wait to be able to buy this DVD. If I could give ANNE FRANK more than 5 stars, I definitely would. This film may be too tense for very young viewers, so I suggest to parents that they the be cautious of the warnings before letting their children watch the film. If you are over the age of twelve, then I strongly recommend you see ANNK FRANK - THE WHOLE STORY...it goes beyond the treasured, best-selling novel we all know of and is absolutely a beautiful film!",1004140800,3,2119,4.520833333333333
1621183,4,B00005LC5R,"This is a film that needed to be made.  Based on Melissa Muller's biography, it covers Anne's life from the beginning of the war in Europe (1939) through her death in 1945.  Many people are familiar with the contents of the diary but don't have a sense of Anne's life as a whole.  This is a sad shortcoming which is helped by viewing this movie.
There are some things that potential viewers should keep in mind, however.  This is a very long film--a little over three hours.  Additionally, as permission was not given for the film makers to use the content of Anne's diary, the scenes in the secret annex don't have the flavor that a person very familiar with the diary might expect.  Lastly, the cinematography sometimes leaves things to be desired.  Particularly outdoor scenes often have a tinge of unreality about them--as if it actually is a movie set.
On the other hand, there are some very powerful performances here.  Ben Kingsley bears a striking resemblance to Otto Frank and plays the character very well.  He is a fine actor whose skills are well in evidence here.  Ultimately, however, it is Hannah Taylor Gordon as Anne who must make or break this film and she carries the weight of this story beautifully.  It is a performance that people should see.
A final thought: as a high school teacher, I overheard some girls discussing the film after they had seen it.  One of them commented that she liked the film though she felt it was unrealistic.  She mentioned, in particular, the scene in Bergen-Belsen where one of her friends throws Anne food over the fence as being unlikely to have happened; and yet, this is a well-documented event told by survivors.  So many things about the Holocaust seem impossible.  This films reminds us of some of the truths and takes us into the depths of those four simple words that end many editions of the diary-- ""Anne's diary ends here.""",1003017600,8,1887,4.658610271903323

The scenes between him and Anne are some of the most heartwarming in the film because of their shy simplicity.

I have seen other movies about her, but this was by far the best portrayal that I have ever seen.  Hannah Taylor-Gordon was Anne Frank to me. Every character that was selected to play in this movie was excellent.  As to the scenes in the concentration camps, I think it is important to educate people about what happened.  Some people say that it is a little much, but you know what, you can't change history.  That is how it happened, horrible as it is to watch.  Many of the survivors are beginning to die and if people aren't willing to pick up a book and read about it, I think the best way to educate people is to show them.

I got to the part where Anne and her family went to the camps. I couldn't watch any more after they started to cut the hair. I don't think I have ever seen such a depressing,intense,and heart wrenching movie. I'm thirteen,and I'm sure different kids can handle different things.

Of course I'm not against the movie,because I think it's good for adults and kids to see what happened back then. ABC did a wonderful job making this film realistic,and everything it is.

7943640,5,B00005LC5R,"I got this to show my class after we read the play version of the Diary of Anne Frank (I teach 8th grade ELA). This movie is by far my favorite. They cover way before going into hiding, and well into the concentration camps. It truly is the whole story! It's flawlessly done, and even my toughest boys cry every time. I just love how the movie really puts it in perspective for the students.
Two warnings, if you show it for kids, please watch it yourself first. You will want to get some tears out before you watch it with them, and there is a part when they first get to Auschwitz where you see butts and boobs. NOT something you want to spring on a class without preparation!
This movie is excellent and I recommend it to everyone.",1496275200,2,734,4.25
