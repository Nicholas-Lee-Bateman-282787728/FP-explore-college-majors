7902075,4,6305293791,"I should say... Shampoo should have figured out by now that Ranma isn't in love with her!! And never will be... or will he? In the first episode, Shampoo buys ""the red string of fate"", that will make Ranma love her forever! poor Ranma. I was laughing my head off through half this episode, but it also has a more touching side. Akane show how much she actually cares about Ranma, and she'd suffer if he married someone else. (""It's like a bad dream that I can't wake up from"") But never fear Ranma fans... Shampoo's plans are foiled once again as AKANE comes to Ranma's rescue. We also see how Ucchan actually also thinks of Ranma as a friend.. (""I would be the first one to wish Ranma happiness if it was true love!"")...
The second episode was somewhat disappointing. Mousse finally snaps after Shampoo's millionth insult, and decides to leave for China. Obviously he doesn't... but what does he do? A must have for any Ranma fan.",1071532800,,931,4.514792899408284
7902076,4,6305293791,"The first episode, ""Shampoo's Red Thread of Dread,"" has Shampoo trying a new strategy to get Ranma Saotome to marry her.  After buying an item called ""The Red Thread of Fate,"" Shampoo finds that if the thread is tied to two people's pinky fingers, in 5 hours, they will be together forever.  She then take the thread, and is able to snare Ranma, who instantly falls for her, making Akane very angry.  However, this does not sit well with Ukyo (who wants to marry Ranma), Mousse (a young man who wants to wed Shampoo), or Kodachi Kuno (who ALSO wants to marry Ranma).  meanwhile, the stubborn yet heartbroken Akane sits quietly by, wondering if she should take action or not.  Very good storyline, taking an ancient myth (red threads that bind people to their chosen mate), and making it exciting.
  The second episode ""Mousse goes home to the Country,"" is probably one of the worst episodes I've ever seen, with Mousse planing to return home, after he receives a note from his mother.  however, he wants to make sure that Shampoo is taken care of by Ranma, and sets out to foil anything he thinks ranma does is indecent (eating food from someone other than Shampoo is one such idea).",995328000,,1183,4.6
7902077,4,6305293791,"Ranma 1/2 has never been a normal show, but this episode goes beyond the call of duty for the Ranma publishing crew. As every Ranma fan knows  Shampoo is still trying to get the old ball and chain on the ever suffering  Ranma. Shampoo tries as hard as ever to get Ranma to love her and with her  knew string who knows if she'll actually get her man. I won't tell, you'll  have to watch to find out. As far as I'm concerned this one is better then  the last, but of course the shows just keep getting better. I'd say that  this tape warrents owning.",969321600,,548,4.122641509433962
