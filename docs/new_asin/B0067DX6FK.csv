8494282,5,B0067DX6FK,"Again, I say ""Dan Inosanto is a Living Legend!""  If you happen agree with me, these videos are essential for *your* collection.  His martial arts instruction in these videos are straightforward and are simply priceless.

HOWEVER, please NOTE that I gave a ""reluctant 5 stars"" for the video content and the wonderful instruction *BUT* I feel compelled to mention that the video quality appears to be an old VHS video conversion onto DVD media; not broadcast quality (from BETAMAX, etc) but completely viewable and still essential for martial artists/collectors, etc. ... *you* know who you are!

I personally own *ALL* of the videos in this series (6). F.

Cheers,
