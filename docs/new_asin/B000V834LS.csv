as she moves through a basic Yoga session.  The service from the supplier was quick, timely and the product arrived is great shape.  Thank you so much

8217197,3,B000V834LS,"Bought this item for my wife to replace a similar one she wore out and was very surprised at the timeliness of delivery, two days! Excellent. However did encounter an initial slight problem with the video tape. Image not visible and tracking adjustment on VCR did not solve the problem. Just as I was contemplating a return, my wife said the problem improved. Perhaps the video, albeit ""New"",sat on the shelf for years (there are no current tapes or DVD's available. Always have good service from Amazon and they make sure you get good service from the approved vendors they do business with.",1311120000,,592,4.757281553398058
8217198,5,B000V834LS,"i've tried several teachers/styles of yoga, and i like nancy's best.  she's really down to earth (which can be rare sometimes in the yoga world) and very descriptive in the correct postures for each pose.  in her classes she would stress not locking your knees in the poses, but in the video, she didn't use this reminder which is the only thing i would recommend changing.  (i ended up having knee aches, and then remembered what she had said previous in class).  i really am grateful for her instruction.  it has helped me reverse a lot of damage from car accidents in a gentle way.",1221004800,3,584,4.523809523809524
