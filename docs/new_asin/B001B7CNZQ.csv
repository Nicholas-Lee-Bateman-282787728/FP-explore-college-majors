3484397,4,B001B7CNZQ,"My daughter and I were introduced to the Barbie movies last winter and since then have purchased every movie.  I bought this latest one for her two days ago and she has already watched it several times.  She loves the singing (traditional Christmas tunes) and the cat Chuzzlewit.  I did feel as though the animation went back a step from the last few Barbie movies...it could easily be mistaken for one of the older Barbie movies. For this reason, I rated it a 4/5.  The writers do a good job in updating the original classic to make it more appealing to younger viewers.  The original themes are still there, but the characters (especially the ghost of yet to come) are not nearly as terrifying as in the book. My daughter is three and was was able to sit through the entire movie without being scared (she was scared a few times in the Magic of Pegasus and Mariposa).  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the other Barbie movies or has a child that does.

******(SPOILER ALERT***** The part of Ebenezer Scrooge is played by Barbie (as Eden Starlight).  She is a theater diva whose signature line is ""In a selfish world, the selfish succeed"".  She lives her life by this and on Christmas Eve, she receives a visit from her Aunt Marie (dragging her chains of burden), who tells her that she will be visited by three spirits.  She wants Eden to know that she made a mistake in raising her to believe that selfish people succeed.  The first spirit appears (Spirit of Christmas Past) and takes Eden back in time to her childhood.  We see her escaping the house she shares with her Aunt and sledding to visit best friend Catherine.  The girls sing together for Catherine's family and are having a great time when there is a knock on the door.  It is Aunt Marie, who goes in a tantrum.  The spirit brings Eden back to present and Eden explains that she was never allowed any more Christmas get togethers with Catherine and her family.  We begin to see why Eden is the selfish diva who hates Christmas so much.  Not long after, the second spirit (Spirit of Christmas Present) arrives and brings Eden to several different places.  First, to the backstage area where her crew are celebrating in spite of the fact that she demanded they didn't.  They are throwing tomatoes at her picture (her friend Catherine included) and we see her begin to realize how demanding she is.  Then, we are taken to the local orphanage, where Catherine has been helping the kids with Christmas caroling in hopes that the orphanage will not have to close come spring.  One little girl in particular (played by Kelly) captures Eden's heart.  We see some compassion from her and then she is taken back to her room for the last spirit.  The spirit of Christmas future arrives (not scary at all) and tells Eden that she is going to show her the future based on the track that her life is following right now.  We see Eden and Chuzzlewit at the backstage area, which is dirty and secluded.  Eden wonders where her crew are and why everything appears the way it does.  We learn that Eden fired her crew on Christmas for being late and since then lost her status as theater star.  She is poor and alone in a selfish world.  She discovers that Catherine has become a famous fashion designer and Eden decides to pay her old friend a visit.  She is saddened to discover that Catherine has become the woman that Eden used to be(cold hearted and selfish).  She begs the ghost to take her back.  She wants to change!  She awakens to find it is Christmas morning and that she can change her future.  She gives her emplyees gifts, bonuses and the day off.  She goes to the orphanage and adopts it in order to prevent its closing.  She also makes up with Catherine and goes to spend Christmas with her and her family once again.  The movie is narrated by Barbie (wearing the gown from the new Holiday Barbie series).  She is telling the story to her little sister Kelly, who has thrown a fit and declared that she hates Christmas (she wants to stay at home on Christmas Eve instead of attending the hospital charity ball).",1226188800,13,4084,4.507482993197279
3484398,5,B001B7CNZQ,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter and she loves it.  She has watched the movie 3 times in the 3 days that we've had it -- and I've lost count of how many times she's watched the DVD extras.  The older she gets, the pickier she is about what she wants to watch more than once and she clearly wants to watch this one over and over.  She is scared of a lot of movies (including some of the Barbie movies), but not this one.

The story has been masterfully re-crafted so that a younger kid can watch it without getting scared; yet the message of the original tale is beautifully preserved.  The ending leaves one with a happy, positive feeling.

The music is great in this movie -- old Christmas classics like ""We Wish You a Merry Christmas"", ""Jolly Old Saint Nicholas"", etc usually sung by Barbie and Teresa.  The smart people at Mattel figured out a great way to include the ""I Feel Connected"" song from Diamond Castle (which my daughter and her friends can't get enough of) in one of the special features.  The song is used for a humorous scene introduced by Barbie and Teresa and starring those two little dogs (Lilly and Sparkles) from the Diamond Castle.

The disk includes:

* the movie
* a menu to choose one of the several songs from the movie (Carol-oke Party, the disk calls it).
* several trailers
* a ""behind the scenes"" video from the Diamond Castle showing the dogs dancing to ""I Feel Connected""
* a nice documentary about how a Barbie Collector Holiday Doll is designed which is told using a mother and daughter getting a tour of the Barbie factory.  Warning -- your daughter will probably want to start buying those expensive Barbie Collector dolls after seeing this.

This movie is a keeper.  I can heartily (really!) recommend it.",1226016000,43,1752,4.471698113207547

Its an okay version. How close can u come to the original when using Barbie?? Also alot of people have been complaining about content of alot of these Barbie movies yet will let kids watch Disney movies whose themes and plots are not meant for children. Almost everyone i can think of is about some sort of racism that gets worked out in the end and scary villians yet ppl let their kids watch these no problem. Barbie is fantasy which is why she can be a mermaid or musketeer. Even Doras Swiper brings a bad message to my kids and hes not punished in any episose except for brief stint on Santas naughty list. I would let them watch any Barbie movie we own over Dora any day in terms of what acts follow. Swiper was emulated immediately but no acts were emulated from Christmas Carol except fits of laughter whenever Chuzzlewit was mentioned by either and he got his dues cuz whenever he went after smtg he always fell or slid or smtg.,1326240000,3,1172,4.331818181818182

3484669,5,B001B7CNZQ,"For nearly every Barbie movie with a classic story as its inspiration, we get several people complaining about how ""inaccurate"" it is. Good news for them; this movie is probably the most accurate adaptation yet.

Sure, the characters aren't quite the same and a few events have been changed around to make it a bit less scary, but overall it's a brilliant adaptation of ""A Christmas Carol"". Barbie plays Eden Starling (note the initials), a talented singer who believes the world revolves around her (""it's a selfish world, and only the selfish succeed"", she says). After threatening to fire her fellow performers if they don't rehearse on Christmas Day, Eden is visited by her Aunt Marie and three spirits. Will they help Eden see the error of her ways?

The animation isn't perfect - it's a bit too bright in places - but overall it's one of the better Barbie movies. Definitely worth a watch, and a good way of introducing your children to Dickens' classic story.",1290643200,4,966,4.778443113772455

3484675,5,B001B7CNZQ,"What little girl doesn't enjoy her Barbie doll coming to ""life"" on the television screen? In this adorable tale, Barbie is cast as a famous Opera singer who has a vain streak as wide as the ocean. She belittles her employees and best friend as she pushes to remain ""center-stage"" in her life on and off the stage. We discover why she has become that way when her ""Bob Cratchet"" comes in the form of her taskmaster Aunt. Chained to an endless amount of mirrors, her aunt pleads for Barbie to change lest she face the same punishment. Following Dickens tale, Barbie is visited by three spirits that evening. The bonus is none of the spirits are scary in any way, so no need to worry about the Ghost of Christmas Future scaring your little ones. The morals taught are the same as in the Dicken's classic: Greed & Selfishness will lead to folly and misery. Double Bonus: Since this is based off a classical tale, it makes it enjoyable for the whole family.

As a mother and a trial attorney, the movie made me ponder my career driven lifestyle.  I can't wait to watch it again with her.",1258156800,2,443,4.068965517241379
3484678,4,B001B7CNZQ,"My son and I collect holiday DVDs and something possessed me to get Barbie in a Christmas Carol. (Maybe I was a sucker for the colorful cover?)

I admit, I had low expectations. I had never seen a Barbie movie, but A Christmas Carol is such a great story, I didn't think it could really be messed up too badly.

I have to say, I am surprised at this movie! We enjoyed it last year and we watched it again a few days ago (yeah, we bring out the holiday tunes and DVDs pretty early...extra early this year, though!). It was just as good as I remembered it.

I won't bore you with a rehash of this new twist on a classic as the Amazon.com description already describes it. I will say that the CGI animation is quite good, with vivid colors, nice effects and gorgeous embellishments (such as the ghost of Christmas Present's dress).

The story is entertaining and heartwarming--redemptive, as you would expect any version of A Christmas Carol to be. The only reason I give it 4 Stars is because the Ghost of Christmas Past is a bit annoying (less so than last year for some reason).

Unfortunately, there's really no Bonus Features on this DVD but the movie itself is certainly worth the money, in my opinion. (And yes, my 11 year old likes it, too! He's a hopeless romantic...)

In the past, I have enjoyed having my girls watch these movies but this is the first one I am disappointed in because Barbie who is narrating this story and who is also on the cover is dressed immodestly.

3484692,3,B001B7CNZQ,"Since this animated movie was produced in the year 2008, and has such a shiny, professionally made jacket in addition to its equally impressive ""jewel"" case and DVD, I expected the graphics to be among the most impressive I'd ever seen.  They are not.  They remind me of an outdated, ""3D"" video game, with two-dimensional graphics stretched across ""three-dimensional"" cyber objects.  When the ""camera"" pans too quickly, the shapes are distorted in zig-zag patterns as if they were on an analog television screen during static interference.

On the bright side (which reminds me, the computer generated lighting is too bright in places), the plots are complex and intriguing.  I say ""plots"" (plural) because there's a plot within a plot.  The traditional ""Christmas Carol"" story is given several twists, including a female antagonist or ""Scrooge"" and her pet cat, Chuzzlewit - a subtle reference to other literary works by the original ""Christmas Carol"" author, Charles Dickens.

There are several special features on the DVD, besides Spanish audio and English subtitles, including interactive activities, so this DVD seems as much like a computer game as a movie.",1232668800,2,1163,5.254054054054054

I also think that the ideas that this movie portrays, such as giving is better than receiving, treat others the way you want to be treated, and thinking about the choices we make are things that are sorely lacking in today's world.

3484708,5,B001B7CNZQ,"This latest Barbie video, a gender-reversed version of Dickens' story ""A Christmas Carol"", has all the high production values and beautiful animation of the recent films, put together with a wicked sense of humour and with some delightful performances of many favourite Christmas Carols.

I'm not quite sure whether to describe this as a homage to Charles Dickins' original story, a spoof/parody, or something in between. Although most of the Barbie videos have included a few jokes and references which were obviously aimed at any adults watching with their daughters, this one IMHO is far and away the funniest Barbie video to date. Maybe it just particularly hit my sense of humour, but in spite of the fact that I'm forty years older and the wrong sex compared with the target demographic, this film repeatedly had me laughing out loud.

Rather more importantly my seven year old twins also enjoyed this film and laughed at many of the jokes, and although he now feels obliged to protest when we put a Barbie video on, I noted that my son was laughing as much as my daughter.

It's also a really good Christmas family film if you have small children, and one which will probably become part of my family Christmas until the children are too old to appreciate it.

The story is bookended on Christmas Eve in modern America, with Barbie trying to enthuse her little sister Shelley with the Christmas spirit. They are due to go out to a charity auction for a hospital, and Shelley is not happy at the change to her routine. Barbie gives her a snow globe which contains three fairies dancing in the snow and plays ""We wish you a merry Christmas."" Barbie explains how this globe is connected with the story of how one girl learned about the Christmas spirit more than a hundred years ago in Victorian London ...

Eden Starling (who is the Ebenezer scrooge figure) was the most successful opera singer in Britain and ran her own theatre. She was beautiful and had the voice of an angel, but was also ruthless, selfish, and very self-centred. She had been raised by her Aunt Maria (the Marley figure) to work hard to further her career and ignore the needs of everyone else on the basis that ""In a selfish world, the selfish succeed.""

At the start of the story, also on Christmas Eve, Eden is refusing to allow the staff of her theatre to take any holiday over Christmas, and warning them that any who fail to come in and rehearse over the holiday, even on Christmas Day, will face the sack. The only living thing for which she still shows any concern is her snooty cat, Chuzzlewit, and she treats even her childhood friend Catherine Beednall with cruelty and contempt.

But that evening she gets a visit from the ghost of her Aunt Maria. In Dickens' original story, the selfishness which corrupted Scrooge, Marley, and others took the form of greed for gold: in this version it mainly takes the form of vanity and ego, and so instead of chains linked to boxes of gold, Aunt Maria's chains are linked to mirrors in which she is reflected.

Aunt Maria tells Eden that the philosophy of selfishness she had taught Eden in life was wrong, and that three spirits will come to her that evening to show her why. These turn out to look just like the figures in the snow globe which Barbie had given Shelley in the opening scene of the film and which, it transpires, Eden had been given by Catherine when they were both little girls.

The gender-reversed presentation of the spirits of Christmas Past, Christmas Present, and Christmas Future is hysterical. Christmas Past looks like a fairy but talks like a cockney barrow-girl, also happens to be a huge fan of Eden Starling and cannot conceal the fact. Christmas Present is rather like an enormous Essex or Kent farmer's wife, similar to Pam Ferris's character Ma Larkin in ""The Darling Buds of May"". Christmas Future, rather than the sinister hooded figure of the original, is a dignified society lady.

Between them they remind Eden both of the warm-hearted person she used to be, and how and why that spirit was crushed out of her, and warn her of how her cold and ruthless egotism threatens to destroy her.

Instead of Tiny Tim we have Tiny Tammy, one of the orphans for whom Catherine is organising a christmas show, but who like the rest of these orphans faces an uncertain future.

The quality of the animation of this DVD is so good that much of the humour is presented in the expressions and movements of the characters, though there are a few very good lines. For example, as the spirit of Christmas Past is flying with Eden and Chuzzlewit through a sort of extra-dimensional tunnel which is taking them back in time, she tells Eden how big a fan she is of her music and adds that for her to be such a huge fan of Eden's must seem very strange. Eden looks around at their supernatural surroundings and replies with dry understatement that for the spirit to be a fan of hers was not the part of this experience which is strange.

Chuzzlewit the cat also provides some slapstick comic relief throughout the film, with several running gags such as his propersity to jump on anything which looks like food, such as decorations on the elaborate dress worn by the spirit of Christmas Present which look like sweets.

Throughout the DVD there is a string of Christmas music, composed and arranged by Arnie Roth, with delightful performances of carols including ""Deck the Halls"", ""We Wish you a Merry Christmas"", ""O Tannenbaum"", and ""Jolly Old St Nicholas.""

DVD extras on the disc include a medley of the christmas carols on the disc with words on the screen so that the viewer can sing along, a number of Christmas games, and a ""secret scene"" from the previous Barbie DVD, ""The Diamond Castle"" in which the two puppies, Lily and Sparkles, are painting the ballroom of the castle pink.

As usual, those people who enjoy criticising what the Barbie franchise represents will not have much difficulty finding things in this production to sneer at. If you, or more importantly your kids, are allergic to an excess of twee sweetness, then this film and the Barbie videos generally may not be for them. As usual the the female characters are mostly on the thin side of plausibility.

Barbie is often accused of reinforcing gender stereotyping, but I don't think the charge is entirely fair. In the case of this film, in which almost all the characters are female and taking on roles which were male in the original, the charge is just not applicable.

Different people have different senses of humour, so it may be unrealistic to expect that all adults will enjoy this as much as I did, but I'm quite certain that the vast majority of little girls will love this film, and most other people will not find it any hardship to watch this with the little girls in your family, especially at Christmas.",1230508800,,6837,4.6503728251864125

Why would Barbie create something like this for the holidays? I innocently thought this DVD was an adaptation of the Christmas Carol, the beloved Charles Dickens story. But I couldn't have been more misled. In this telling, a sadistic and evil `Barbie Doll' named Eden forces an entire theater company to practice on Christmas day. My God, my God, what have we become?

The three spirits or (ghosts) are really not scary at all for the kids.

Join Barbie and her little sister, Kelly as she tells the story of a scroogified young beauty (Eden) who is a singer in Victorian England. Eden appears selfish, but as the story progresses, and you learn more about her, she seems more sympathetic.

This was a sweet animated Christmas film which teaches that people aren't always what they seem, and the values of generosity, kindness, loyalty and friendship. Barbie tells the story well, and youngsters will be able to learn empathy, as well as see that people can change if they really want to.

This is a film youngsters will enjoy and watch over and over. If had to improve the film, I might give a male character a stronger role, and perhaps show more of the other characters on stage, since the acting troupe had some interesting characters.

3484743,5,B001B7CNZQ,"While other recent Barbie movies have been disappointing lately, Barbie in A Christmas Carol finally lives up to the standard of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbie-As-The-Princess-and-the-Pauper/dp/B0002CHJZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbie As The Princess and the Pauper</a>-- *without* any awkward explaining to do or scary scenes to traumatize.

The story within a story is used to hammer home a lesson (which is pummeled into kids well enough without it), and the Holiday Barbie telling the story is yet another blatant marketing insertion that was completely unnecessary. The accents are mostly done in ""The Queen's English"" and are not really authentic British accents, and once again Kelly Sheridan isn't in the lead (note to Mattel: GRRR!). If you can look past these faults, this is a gem of a children's film.

The colors have been toned down as compared to the other Barbie films, but it still has enough vibrance and movement to hold kids' attention. Aunt Marie subbing for Bob Marley, as well as the Christmas Spirits, are never scary (like Christmas Future in the book was ), and for the most part do things with a sense of humor. Christmas Past is probably my favorite. Chuzzlewit is funny and has a personality very much like my own cat.

Eden makes a fantastic Scrooge, being a delightfully unlikable character who becomes someone for whom you can start to feel some sympathy. Barbie points out to Kelly in the frame story that it's harder to judge someone when you know the whole story. In spite of the fact that I feel that lessons and morals are overdone in all the Barbie movies, this is a lesson I rarely see in any children's movie and is well done. Catherine fills in the role of Bob Cratchitt as Eden's costume designer, and what a refreshing role it is for a Barbie movie! She is darker skinned, as is her family, and they are all good characters that contrast with Eden's selfish ways. I hope Mattel includes more characters like Catherine in the future-- it's definitely a leap forward for a series that has been sorely lacking in the diversity department.

This isn't a musical, but there is enough Christmas music in the movie to make up for it, as well as singalongs in the extras on the DVD. This is a movie anyone can watch. Get it for your kids, and if you find yourself watching it over and over as well, Chuzzlewit and I won't tell. :-)",1227484800,,2421,4.926470588235294

Great movie, good storyline, great songs, and beautiful animation!

A real treat for all those dreaming of sugar plums this time of year.
