3054919,5,B0010XQUAK,"Admittedly, I am no longer a teenager. However, as a volunteer with a public agency who often works with young people, I feel I am qualified to comment on this amazing DVD.

This DVD does not presume to be a simple ""self-help in 10 minutes"" program. Bill Morris effectively lays out the building blocks that today's teenagers must be mindful of as the prepare for and move into adult roles of responsibility. From items as fundamental as nutrition to more in-depth sections on time management, priorities and goal setting, Bill is able to explain in clear, concise terms both HOW to build the framework for success as well as WHY it's important to undertake these steps. More importantly, Bill clearly lays out how all of the elements of the program are intertwined, and build on each other.

I can wholeheartedly say, had I been able to watch a DVD like this when I was in my teenage years, I probably would have had a much easier time in Univeristy. Indeed, some of the DVD was even useful for ME, and I completed my teenage years well over a decade ago.

Definitely a ""must buy"" if you have teenagers.",1197590400,,1104,4.565656565656566
