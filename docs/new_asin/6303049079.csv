543989,4,6303049079,"There's no doubt about it,  modern comedy films about men in drag such as ""Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert"", ""Tootsie"" and ""Mrs Doubtfire"" have all worked beautifully due to carefully  conceived bittersweet scripts and impeccable casting. ""Mrs  Doubtfire"" isn't quite as astute a comedy as ""Tootsie"" but  it's good fun all the way. There could have been no better choice for the  title role than Williams due to his extremely expressionistic face, his  wonderful vocal range and his adeptness with both humour and melancholy.  The story is simple - irresponsible husband dresses up as a housekeeper to  win his family back. The skill of the film is how this implausible plot is  handled. Williams makes ""Daniel Hillard"" the type you could  believe would go to such extremes! Much of the movies fun comes from the  way Daniel/Mrs Doubtfire handles his wifes new love interest - Stu (Pierce  Brosnan) with sly asides. Eg: When Stu steps out of a swimming pool she  says ""From the look of you that water is so cold."" The highlight  is the restuarant sequence where Daniel has appointments as both himself  and his femme half and must continually change identities. The best lines  (and there are many throughout the film) come when Mrs Doubtfire comments  on Stu's gift to Miranda. ""Bit of a down payment eh?"" Like  Tootsie, this film is a gem with pathos, humour and old-fashioned charm.",954720000,3,1384,4.866952789699571
543990,5,6303049079,"I have always loved this movie and have viewed it several times on VHS.  However, being a new DVD owner, I knew it needed to be in my collection.  This was money well spent.
I have viewed several DVD's and one of their  greatest assets is the ""Bonus"" or ""Extra"" material many  of them offer.  They range from simple theatrical trailers to prodution  commentary throughout the film (the film can be watched without the  commentary).  Of all the ones I have observed, Mrs. Doubtfire has the best  ""behind the scenes"" thus far.
I was fascinated by the make-up  artistry, the interviews and the cartoon.  In the final version, the  animation section is not very long.  However, the original ""cut""  is about six minutes long and rather entertaining.
There it is.  If you  enjoy behind the scenes footage and you enjoyed the movie itself, you must  have Mrs. Doubtfire on your shelf at home.",948499200,7,885,4.6797385620915035
543991,5,6303049079,"Dude looks like a lady!  I loved, loved, LOVED this movie!  At times I laughed so hard I cried, and Robin Williams is most definitely at his absolute wacky, zany BEST!  In the film, an estranged husband, (Williams),  wants so desperately to spend time with his three kids, that he goes so far  as to dress up as a kindly, matronly female housekeeper - hence, ""Mrs.  Doubtfire"" is ""born""!  The most hilarious scenes in the  movie involve Williams having to rush in and out of his heavily padded,  Mrs. Doubtfire get-up!  (Just visualizing this in my mind ""cracks me  up"" right now)!  Yet, at the same time, Williams' character also  manages to tug at your heart with his sincerety and good intentions.  If  you haven't yet seen this movie, you're missing out on a real laugh fest.  My advice is to treat yourself to this comedic delight, now, and add it to  your collection of ""feel good"" movies!",948412800,4,895,4.563291139240507

I loved the character of Stewart Dunmire.  It was the first time I ever saw Pierce in a comedy role.
He looked like he was having alot of fun with it.
He  is a sexy, gorgeous, handsome businessman in this one, who tries to win  back the affections of the girl he left go years ago.
There is some of  the Remington Steele comic antics, but it also shows a sensitive, more  romantic side to him.
He did a great job.  There should have been more of  him though.",928454400,2,519,4.029411764705882

544190,4,6303049079,"The early 1990s film, Mrs. Doubtfire, captures the drama of a rocky marriage with the comedic element of impersonation. When first viewing the film, one may consider it a drama/comedy, but upon taking a closer look, one discovers evidence that the film is a subgroup of the Romantic Comedy genre. The film can be viewed as a divorce romantic comedy, in which going through or having had a divorce helps the characters to grow individually, helping them to appreciate their partner more and helping the partner appreciate them more. In Mrs. Doubtfire, the wife (Sally Field), proposes the break up of the marriage. She feels like she does not have support from her husband in taking care of the cleaning, cooking and the kids. The husband (Robin Williams), is out of a job and, missing his kids, impersonates a British nanny who is hired by Fields character. Williams get to be with his kids and learns from his wife what she always wanted from him. Williams acting ability speak for itself as he transforms time and time again between Mrs. Doubtfire and dad. We get to experience the change Williams is able to bring to the screen in voice and body that makes audiences forget that Mrs. Doubtfire and the childrens dad is the same person. The dialogue in the film is able to make the most dramatic of moments humorous and the most humorous of moments dramatic, keeping the viewer engaged throughout.

The film captures the idea of remarriage, written extensively about by Stanley Cavell. Over time, I have interpreted remarriage as a couple who has been in a relationship with one another before, we know that they love each other and are meant to be, but in the present time, we do not know why they are meant to be or how they will realize they are. The film Crazy, Stupid, Love also focuses around a remarriage plot within the sub genre of divorce romantic comedy. Steve Carell and Julianne Moores characters are going to get divorced, but each, throughout the film, grows to have new personality characteristics and traits that helps them to see that they do not want a divorce, but rather each other. Mrs. Doubtfire is similar to that film because both members of the relationship change, resulting in the the partner liking the other better for their new efforts and traits. The main difference in films is the of ambiguity in Mrs. Doubtfire of whether the main couple will get back together again. Mrs. Doubtfire is a critically acclaimed piece, but not for its ability to reinterpret and refreshed the romantic comedy genre. The next time you're at home on a Saturday night and watch the film, you can tell your coworkers on Monday you watched a Rom Com over the weekend.",1523836800,,2679,4.7243589743589745

544285,2,6303049079,"I was expecting much more from a two hour movie but I was surprised that this movie did not meet my expectations.  I remember when this came out in 1993 but I only got around to watching it today based on a review I had recently seen.  I was expecting something along the lines of a Home Alone-type family movie that you could watch with just about anyone just about anytime but this is not exactly that type of movie.

The story itself has some substance but it could have been written better because I just found it to be a little on the boring and predictable side.  I also didn't think they explained Pierce Brosnan's character well enough so he just seemed out of place throughout the whole movie.

There were a few sexual jokes that dropped my jaw because I didn't think the censors circa 1993 would let those get through.  There were also a few shocking racial one-liners cleverly hidden in there that I did not appreciate because they added nothing to the movie other than a cheap laugh at someone else expense. If you think this movie is a timeless classic like Home Alone or Home Alone 2, you will probably be disappointed.

The movie was kinda bland for the most part.  The restaurant scene was probably the highlight but this won't go down as a great movie in my book.  I also wanted more finality to the ending but it ended where I think a few more acts could have taken place to properly give the story a happy ending.

That's my opinion, yours will be different.  I don't plan on watching this again and wish I rented it instead of buying it.",1522195200,,1557,4.371527777777778

544587,4,6303049079,"In Truth, I would love to give this movie a higher rating, but the criminal mistreatment of the ""Good American Husband"", is absolutely appalling.
In a culture where there are so many Men who bail on their families, it is rare and precious to encounter the ""Doubtfire Men"", who are incredible fathers, loving husbands, and yet, they are often treated like criminals.

In this story, the Mother of the family openly ADMITS that she did not like the person she was, and how much her children loved their father, instead of her.
Therefore, she jealously hated her husband, and demanded a divorce.

Shortly thereafter, we find her with a new man, completely unphased by the divorce, while her children suffer, and her husband struggles to see his kids, and maintain their relationship.
This dude loves his kids so much that he concocts a plot to disguise himself as a nanny, and manages to get himself hired by his ex-wife, so that he can not only be closer to his kids, but so that he can try and convince his Ex that she has made a horrifying mistake. (which she did)

First of all, this man is a certified Champion, and Hero, as a father.
I cannot fathom what kind of an insane, selfish, malevolent woman, would not absolutely love their husband for being such a great father, and companion.

Normally, I would question the legitimacy of this archetype, but unfortunately, this is a real, and very common, dynamic in American Culture, today.
People, nowadays, say that it's never just one person, and that it takes two to soil a relationship.

That is not the Truth.
It takes one person to pull the trigger, if they want to, and that's one of the things that made this movie so sad, and painful, because that is exactly what happened.

There is such a thing as a ""Victim"" in any given circumstance, and it's no different with intimate relationships.
Things aren't gonna be picture perfect all the time, but that doesn't mean that you go, and make up lies, and trash your family, just because you wanna be selfish about this or that.

Everybody wants to have a loving family together in this movie, except this harlot of a mother.
It's a crime, I tell you, a crime! (horror)

What does she think is gonna happen, anyways?
Those kids are gonna grow up, and realize their mother willfully ripped their family apart.

I understand that everybody loves this movie for Robin Williams silliness, and antics, but the Truth is that the core of this story is very, very sad, and disappointing.
It's not fun watching a dude get totally emasculated on-screen, to the point where they actually dress him up as an old woman, in order for this chick to open her eyes, and realize that she loves this guy. (but not if he's a man)

Yeah, she has a high-paying, suit-wearing job, so she wants to come home, and play the man, and get all the affection and attention, from her kids, that her husband got, because he was a killer-dad.
That's why she hated him, and destroyed their family, so she could get her kicks; but that didn't actually happen until he started coming in as Mrs. Doubtfire!

You might think that's harsh, but re-watch the movie, and I guarantee you, you will see hard signs of what I'm saying.
What's ironic is they cast a very soft actress to play the dominatrix role of the mother, to give her an empathetic quality, but if you take a hard look at her choices, and the things she openly admitted, it's indisputable that she was a JERK.

She didn't want to be his Wife.
Yet, she wanted him to be her Nanny.
(hear that whip-crack?)

Decent Men have to be extremely careful, nowadays, because unfortunately, there are a surprising number of crazy women out there who are shallow, and have no idea what Real Love is.
How can you NOT Love a man you Loves you like that, and who Loves your Kids like that, and who they are ecstatic to Love, themselves?

That's the core dynamic, here, that I think most people overlook.
Everyone is so fixated on this Doubtfire caricature, but the real Gold is the True Love of a Father, which is so Rare and Precious, in this day-and-age.",1514073600,,4066,4.552054794520548

544658,5,6303049079,"Many families in the United States unfortunately face divorce. Mrs. Doubtfire tells a story that helps young children recognize what kind of effect divorce could have on them and what the actual outcome is. The film teaches it is not important if your parents are together or not whoever you live with you will feel like a family. The film is an inspiration for childrens families who are facing divorce. The movie is very humorous as Williams goes back and forth from being a dad to an old lady. Daniel gets his life together by getting a job in the local station. My favorite scene is at the restaurant when he switches from table to table. Sadly, he fails and his secret is revealed. I was sad when the court did not give him joint custody because he did everything the judge asked him to do. In the end he gets hired as the babysitter and this allows him more time with the children. Divorce can be a hard thing for a family but over time you get use to it.",1512518400,,961,4.314917127071824
544659,5,6303049079,"Mrs. Doubtfire tells the story about a family that is faced with dealing with divorce and custody issues. While the mother believes the divorce is best for the family, the father does not want to accept that the family is broken up and he creates a persona, Mrs. Doubtfire, to remain in the lives of his children and his ex-wife. By the end of the film, he is unsuccessful in rebuilding his family to the way it was before, but he does learn that his wife was right - the divorce was the best decision for the well-being of each family member. The film also explores gender roles. The traditional gender roles of motherhood and fatherhood are rejected in this film as the mother is the breadwinner and the father ends up being the homemaker (after becoming Mrs. Doubtfire). ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" teaches the lesson that a family does not have to consist of a married couple with children, but the definition of family is fluid. The divorce did not change their title as a family. Ultimately, it increased the well-being of the members, which should be a priority in a family.",1512432000,,1070,4.607329842931938

No one but Robin Williams could fill the dual role of himself and a loving nanny. I would recommend this film to everyone.,1509148800,,259,4.3061224489795915
544764,5,6303049079,"You watch a movie like this and miss Robin Williams like you'd known him all your life. The writing is sharp and well balanced between the over the top and the tender. The supporting cast shines, and Robin Williams is at the top of his game in what is one of his greatest roles. This movie handles the subject of a family dealing with divorce almost perfectly, and does so from a very approachable perspective. The over the top humor works because the characters are so authentically written that you go through a wide range of emotions when watching this film. A classic definitely worth watching.",1508371200,,598,4.650943396226415

545063,4,6303049079,"Some very long drawn out , draggy patches, and awkward mix of real and surreal but wonderful acting from all , especially Sally Field . Williams is Williams but the director keeps him just a little low-key. Too bad.
Hippie daddy and pragmatic wife have grown apart, divorce, and a kind of role reversal scenario sustains the family ( and an hilarious denouement ). Daddy is a genius voice over artist who finds he can apply his talents to playing a ""Mrs."" - *acting * as the hired housekeeper , able to get a full week with the kids ,as opposed to just a lousy Saturday. He /she also gets a chance to watch the new suitor , Pierce Brosnan, and we are treated to a screamingly funny poolside scene. Brosnan , looking like Gentlemans Quarterly in his bathing suit and Williams sits off to the side, dressed in his English maid attire, muttering to himself!

545190,5,6303049079,"Anything that the late Robin Williams is in is a winner.  In this movie he's been having a hard time finding and keeping jobs and he's more like a Mr. Mom.  His wife works full time, and has met an old boyfriend.  On his son's birthday he throws a party with an animal petting zoo and break dancing in the house, what a mess.  His wife comes home early and is irate.  She decides to divorce him.  The judge gives the kids to his wife with a few hours a week with his kids.  That's not long enough for him so he had an idea to ask his gay brother to make him look like a housekeeper because his wife is looking for one.  His brother styles him like an older lady and when she calls the advertisement she gets an interview right away.  He plays the part so well that he gets the job.  Now you'll have to see the rest of the movie to learn what happens",1488412800,,849,3.970414201183432

Not only is it a movie with one of the greatest comedians of all time, but it had many other actors and actresses that you couldn't really imagine anyone else doing better than these. I was born the year that it was released, which makes me feel extra sentimental, and this movie actually helped me when my parents divorced 10 years ago.

It makes people laugh, but also has a touching message that can relate to anyone watching. As well as an ending that could be interpreted into what you see. I do not recommend some of the parts for children that don't have a certain maturity level, but it is not as vulgar as some of the other comedies that Robin Williams starred in. Highly recommended and I can watch it over and over again.",1467072000,,752,4.364285714285714

As always, Robin Williams played a wonderful role as a loving father. We were not overly impressed with the Role Sally Field plays. But, it's still a 5 Star movie because of Robin Williams heartfelt acting!",1466294400,,486,4.586206896551724

546554,1,6303049079,"In my opinion, Mrs. Doubtfire is a horrible movie!  Read on to find out why I think so.  Near the end where Robin Williams is granted back into the lives of his children, they look at him questioningly and he says, ""Ask your mom,"" to which Sally Field replies, ""I fixed it.""  The message is that a mother is all-powerful and can bend the will of the courts with a wave of her hand.  I don't care how much or how little this may resemble actual circumstances, it is wrong and sends a disgusting message.  I had custody of and raised my children from my first marriage (I'm their father) and this notion that men are second-class parents is an affront to all loving fathers.

I don't feel like it's appropriate for my kids (9,7, and 5) yet, but in a few years I will show it to them. My husband and I both enjoyed it as well.",1449619200,,476,4.021052631578947

Don't think it's good for young kids because some of the issues regarding divorce and jealousy might be a bit over their heads, but great for middle schoolers and adults with a good sense of humor.  I have seen this movie several times and still find some of the lines witty and clever.  This movie also contains an uplifting message.  In all, it's well done, the acting is good (I mean it's Robin Williams), the script is terrific (I mean it's Robin Williams X2) and the premise, although perhaps unrealistic, is made believable.  Importantly, there's a sense of assuming responsibility for bad choices and accepting consequences for one's choices which makes the film all the more endearing.",1438214400,,710,4.891666666666667

548011,5,6303049079,"This movie had me laughing so hard I actually got a headache! Robin Williams is beyond funny in it, he'll have you rolling on the floor laughing. Sally Field is brilliant in it, along with Mara Wilson and the other actors.

It's a great blend of slapstick, comedy, heartfelt moments, touching scenes, and just downright hilarious lines that today are still classics. If this movie doesn't make you laugh, then you have no sense of humor. Period. That is how funny it is.

Also, the Behind the Seams Edition has TONS of deleted, extended and alternate scenes, along with hilarious outtakes! A couple deleted scenes are hilarious moments where Mrs Doubtfire gets back at the nosy neighbor next door by ruining her garden.

Another hilarious deleted scene includes her messing up the washer, flooding the floor, while on the phone with Sally Field. There's also a deleted scene of the fight between the two at home after the restaurant scene when Sally Field finds out Doubtfire is really Robin.

As I stated, if this movie doesn't make you laugh, you got NO sense of humor whatsoever. It is a brilliant film, one of the late Robin William's BEST.",1437177600,3,1144,4.762626262626263

548365,5,6303049079,"As I embark on my first review of Robin Williams' work since his untimely passing, just in time for the first  Father's Day his children will spend without him, I contemplate how much of himself he brought to his role as Daniel Hillard.
  Daniel Hillard is a voice actor with an unstable employment history. After we are introduced to Daniel as he is dismissed from  a job voicing cartoon characters, we view him in the scenario that fuels the story--the loving relationship he has with his three children--the often subtly petulant Lydia( Lisa Jakub), his soccer-loving son, Chris( Matthew Lawrence), and the wide-eyed, slightly lisping, storybook-loving five-year-old, Natalie(Mara Wilson), despite his many shortcomings.
  On Chris' 12th birthday, his wife, Miranda( Sally Field), an interior designer, is called away from her San Francisco office by her neighbor, Gloria( Polly Holliday), to deal with the party, which especially with the presence of  certain petting zoo animals in violation of city ordinances, has really gotten out of hand. I would have to agree with a recent reviewer's criticisms of Daniel's reckless and sometimes ill-bred character.
  After finding Daniel, the big kid she married in the center of the chaos, an angry Miranda pulls the plug not only on the party, but after what is presumably the last in a long line of many heated arguments, also  on the couple's 14-year marriage as the children watch from the staircase.
  Soon, under the watchful eyes of Miranda's mother(Jessica Myerson), Daniel leaves the family home on Steiner Street, reassuring his children, and being a bit snide towards his ex-mother-in-law-to-be.
  After spending some time with his make-up artist brother, Jack( Harvey Fierstein) and his partner, Jack(Scott Caparro), Daniel takes up residence in a run-down apartment over a store, and spends a marginalized  amount of time with the children, barely masking his despondency over the break-up of his marriage by thinly veiled remarks about his ex- that upset and bewilder his 5-year-old as  she and her siblings dine with him. But he uses a little humor to placate her.
  When Miranda's honking  car horn is heard outside and the kids get up to leave, Daniel's hostility becomes full-blown as he demands they stay put and finish their Chinese take-out, reminding him amid the use of an expletive that they're his children, too.
  Miranda has an angry confrontation with Daniel, and Natalie's repetition of her father's choice phrase does not encourage Miranda to give him more time with the children.
  He learns she is placing an ad for a housekeeper to tend to the children when they come home from school, and fudges the details of the ad submission form when she is not looking.
  Once the ad appears in the paper, Daniel disguises his voice while making anonymous phone calls in response to the ad, horrifying Miranda before creating the persona  that she will want to meet,  selecting the name, ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" from a randomly viewed phrase in a newspaper headline.
  Daniel heads to Frank and Jack's place before his scheduled Monday meeting, and  as the two labor to make him look like a woman who can pass for a suitable nanny , we are led through Williams' trademark comic schtick as we view him as a long-nailed Latina, a Jewish Bubbie, and Barbra Striesand (complete with the blue eyes enabling him to pull off an impressive imitation of his real-life friend) before Frank adds some latex, a grey wig with a winged section and a bun, a body suit, stockings, glasses, and a sweet, preppie ensemble before Luck proves to be a lady.
  The following Monday evening, Miranda and her reluctant young trio are introduced to a  sweet 60-year-old woman with a slight Scottish brogue, who immediately touches on the interests  of the younger two, but will have to work hard to break the ice with Lydia.
  Amid many an ironic quip, Daniel must be careful not to give himself away, keeping a few interesting secrets in a closely held camel-flague bag of considerable size. But Miranda is so impressed and delighted  that she unwittingly hires her ex-husband.
  Daddy's home!
  As Daniel takes on household responsibilities, slowly and finally becoming the husband and father he might have been during the previous 14 years, Miranda's old boyfriend, Stu( Pierce Brosnan) re-enters her life, initially as a client, much to her delight.
  In the meantime, Daniel's  female alter-ego endures a flirtation from a kindly bus driver( Sydney Walker), and the scrutiny of  his court
liason,Mrs. Sellner(Anne Haney). In a riotous scene of immense physical comedy and one-liners, he manages to avoid blowing his cover in Mrs. Sellner's presence, although his latex face mask is destroyed and he will have to replace it. Two laughing young brothers(Kenneth and Jeff Loo) watching from their apartment window observe the hilarity.
  In daylight hours as himself, Daniel takes a job as a shipping clerk at a local TV station, but always manages to become Mrs. Doubtfire in time to be with his children, who become more disciplined .
  Eventually Chris and Lydia stumble upon the secret, and after the startling discovery, are  sworn to secrecy, happy to know their Dad is with them.
  But Miranda's new relationship with the man she regrets not having married progresses. At one point while having tea at the kitchen table with Miranda, Daniel learns some hard truths about himself and the reasons why his marriage failed.
  By this time, his envy of his estranged wife's new beau has surfaced, reaching a high point when he joins the family at Stu's country club where  they cavort in the pool with the athletic suitor. However, Daniel is not above flirting with a bikini clad blonde stunner(Betsy Monroe) as he sits at the poolside bar. A remark Stu makes about his sweetheart's ex sends him over the edge for a moment , but as the sweet elderly Mrs. Doubtfire, Daniel easily staves off Stu from finding out who threw produce at his head from behind.  Williams' real-life half-brother Todd, presides over the scene as the bartender.
  As Daniel's double life continues, he improves his situation at the TV studio, attracting the attention of the executive and station owner, Mr. Lundy( Robert Prosky) while doing an improv bit with dinosaur figurines on the vacant set of a soon-to-be-cancelled  children's show.
  Daniel's ability to continue the ruse reaches a crisis  point when both Miranda and Mr. Lundy want both him and Mrs. Doubtfire to dine with them at Bridges Restaurant on the same evening at the same time. He will now have to placate Mr. Lundy while finding a way to sabotage the rival for his estranged wife's affections.
  Ultimately, the mask is stripped away, and despite  emotional and poignant pleas of fatherly love in court, it appears Daniel is likely to have only supervised weekend visits with his children unless Miranda can be moved by the wittiness that once attracted her to her ex-husband to find humor in the situation.
  Under Chris Columbus' direction, the all-too-frequent social misfortune of the break-up of a family, based on Anne Fine's book, ""Alias Madame Doubtfire"", is given comical treatment, and the children affected are given gentle reassurance by a very special elderly lady.",1434844800,,7267,5.005838198498749

548466,3,6303049079,"I was never a big fan of this movie and I wasn't quite sure why? My wife on the other hand loves it and while flipping around the channels looking for something to watch, we happened across this film, and showed it to our kids. I'm pretty sure that everyone knows the plot of this one, and it's entered the public consciousness, but just in case there are a few cave dwellers out there.

An obnoxious voice-over artist gets fired from his latest job, and travels over to his kids' school to pick them up so that he can throw his 12-year old son a birthday party, even though his son has been told by their mother, that no party's are allowed. The party soon gets out of hand with petting zoo animals running wild, loud music and police arriving to shut everything down. The mom arrives home in time to see kids literally swinging from the chandeliers, and horses roaming through her living room. She is so furious with her oblivious husband she demands a divorce. Instead of learning anything from his wife or the experience, the actor pouts and places all of the blame on the mother. Being without a job and without a decent place for the kids to live, the actor loses custody of the kids. And unless he can prove that he can hold down a job, then his visitation will be restricted. The mother, needing some help with the kids and house, puts an ad in the paper for a housekeeper. Her now ex-husband sabotages the add, and answers the add himself, dressed in an old woman disguise.

I think some age has put into perspective why I never really liked this film. Robin Williams' ""Daniel"" is a horrible person, just completely unlikable. He's a jerk, he's rude, he's awful to the people around him, and he honestly doesn't care. As the film opens we see him wasting thousands of dollars by refusing to stay on script while voicing a cartoon, he the proceeds to throw his wife under the bus by throwing a huge party trashing their house, and then whines when she says she's had enough. Then, instead of securing a job and finding an apartment, he belittles his case worker, refused to clean up his house, and talks trash about his ex-wife to the kids. Then instead of sucking it up, and getting on with his life, he deceives his entire family by showing up in disguise, and then tries to manipulate each of the kids and his ex by insulting the new boyfriend of the mother. Daniel tries to sabotage the relationship at every turn. And, if all of that weren't bad enough, when Daniel does find a new job at the local TV station stockroom, he manages to destroy the career of a long-time TV host by trashing the host's show to the station manager. Daniel deserves none of the good things that happen to him over the course of this film, he's a horrible, manipulative person.

With that said, there are some laughs throughout. Williams' does a fantastic job of bringing the titular character to life, and Sally Field is always fun to watch, it's just a shame she's stuck on one-note for most of the film. Pierce Brosnan doesn't get much to do here but play the generic handsome love interest. If ""Daniel"" were played by someone with less charm than Robin Williams, then this film would be unwatchable, but thanks to the manic energy and humor Williams brings to the role, you can't help but get a smile or two.",1433808000,2,3303,4.46523178807947

I like movies with a more positive message then ""If you make the divorced wife mad, she'll take the kids away from you forever."" This movie makes both men and women look bad and I don't blame the actors, it's a paycheck and they're probably passionate about their careers. So with that inmind, I blame the screenwriters. Mrs. Doubtfire conceals it's lying, deceptive message under one that sounds positive at first glance.

The movie is about a dad who proves that he will do whatever it takes to see his kids. Even if that ""does what it takes"" is crossdressing and humilating himself. In the meantime, the wife proves to be a real witch who is so horrid of a person that she will take a child's birthday away from him. Punishing someone by taking memories that are special away from them, sounds like REAL parenting to me!

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Euphegenia Doubtfire [Robin Williams] joins a long list of comic female characters played by men for narrative purposes. Other memorable cross-dressing film characters include Joe and Jerry who became Josephine and Daphne respectively in Some Like It Hot [1959]; Michael, who became Dorothy in Tootsie [1982]; and Brian and Charlie who became Sisters Euphenia and Inviolata respectively in Nuns On The Run [1990]. When Mrs Doubtfire was released in 1993, another classic performance was born, with Robin Williams playing the lady of the title, whose shining light and comedy genius has now been taken away from us.

Critics were somewhat muted in their response to the film from the perspective of story-line, originality and length, but all agreed that Robin Williams performance was alone responsible for saving the film from failure. His manic delivery, his mastering of a whole range of accents and voices and his very believability as a woman made this one of his most compelling and admired performances. Robin Williams funniest lines were ad-libbed rather than scripted, and that this created a sharper and more hilarious comedy. In this relatively simple tale of marital break-down, and a desperate desire by one partner to maintain contact with the children of that marriage, there was probably little in the original script likely to upset or challenge family audiences. The film was based on Alias Madame Doubtfire by Anne Fine, which was first published in 1987, and became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. The popularity of the book meant that the film was eagerly awaited by many UK families and children as well.

Mrs. Doubtfire is about a man who dresses as a Scottish dowager to invade the household of his estranged wife, who has thrown him out. Here we find Robin Williams lurks behind a latex face mask, ready to scatter wicked jokes and brilliant non sequiturs about whatever crosses his mind. Robin Williams's genius is in these details, and it is given free rein during much of Mrs. Doubtfire, as in the sequence that has him improvising with toy dinosaurs at a television studio and coming up with a Raptor Rap. (""Yo, yo, see me/I'm livin' below the soil/I'll be back/But I'm comin' as oil."") But if this film creates as good a showcase for the Robin Williams zaniness as anything short of the Disney animation Aladdin.

A lot of the film has gone into giving a sitcom shininess to Mrs. Doubtfire, which was directed by Chris Columbus (who also did both Home Alone films). Attention has been paid to everything from the sunny, well-heeled look of the family household to the pert costumes on Sally Field, who plays Robin Williams's careerist wife. The story is that the wife's job alone is enough to villainies her: Miranda Hillard [Ms. Sally Field] is seen doing something terribly important involving fabric swatches, while her sweet, helpless husband, Daniel [Robin Williams], cannot stay employed dubbing voices onto animated films. When Miranda complains about his childishness, kicks him out of the house and keeps him from seeing enough of their three children.

Conveniently, Daniel has a brother [Harvey Fierstein], a right tart and is very funny here, who specialises in makeup effects. And naturally Daniel is an actor, just as Dustin Hoffman's character was in the funnier, more substantial Tootsie, which unavoidably comes to mind. That film made the most of its hero's hostility, allowing it to become part of the joke. This one insists on a veneer of good intentions, which wears thin long before the story culminates in a speech about families and love.

Once the screenplay, by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon, has accomplished the gargantuan job of getting Daniel into a dress (so that he can play nanny to his own children). There's a sequence about how Daniel, now done up as the broad-backed, hairy-legged matron of the title, can't cook dinner for the children, even though he has been feeding and caring for them for years. There are also two separate episodes, one elaborately staged in a restaurant, when Daniel must become a quick-change artist and jump into and out of his Mrs. Doubtfire drag. No audience will believe he can do this in a few seconds' time, but of course in the process is total humorous mayhem.

The film keeps busy by finding Miranda a handsome chump of a boyfriend [Pierce Brosnan], who becomes a fine target for Daniel's insults and the subject of Mrs. Doubtfire's motherly advice to Miranda. (""Once the father of your children is out of the picture, the only solution is lifelong celibacy,"" the nanny says sweetly.) It also lets Daniel's son [Matthew Lawrence] catch his father in the bathroom and discover his disguise, asking nervously: ""You don't really like wearing that stuff, do you, Dad?"" Even then, the comic possibilities posed by letting the children in on the joke are never quite explored, despite this, it worked.

Robin Williams remains the film's main and only real attraction, although Ms. Sally Field tries gamely to generate sitcom-calibre sparks. Robin Williams is definitely well worth seeing whatever he's wearing, but he's most fun in an anarchic mode, threatening to blow the film's illusions wide open. The dress, the mask and Mrs. Doubtfire's gentility are inherently very funny, but nothing holds Robin Williams back when he's on a roll. You may not believe he could pass for a woman, but you'll want to see what he can do with a vacuum cleaner all the same.

One thing Mrs. Doubtfire does well is to avoid the often-used plot device of trying to turn Pierce Brosnan's Stu, who is Miranda's new love interest, trying to turn him into a snake. He never comes across as anything but charming, and Daniel's dislike of him is based on purely selfish reasons. In fact, there really isn't a nasty or mean-spirited character in the film. Imagine that, a film without a villain.

Everything comes back to comedy, and for the most part, that means Robin Williams. Due in part to his ability and in part to Chris Columbus' sense of timing, most of Mrs. Doubtfire works. But to most critics it has been said that is a flawed film, but I totally disagree as there are loads of times it is sheer genius entertainment and enjoyment win out over the technical and intellectual aspects of film making. Few that see the film Mrs. Doubtfire will emerge grumbling about wasting time and money and anyone who doesn't laugh during the course of the whole film are missing something truly special. To me it is Robin Williams funniest hilarious film of all time and gets a generous 5 star rating.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Basically fairly solid 1080p encoded image quality with few weaknesses. Usually good and consistent sharpness and detail drawing. Satisfactory contrast with the 2.35:1 ratio with good black level. Most little pale-looking, but good colour reproduction. Scattered scenes offer solid depth effect. The Master used has not really aged, but at least you can say that the presentation is impressive. Image values move at a satisfactory, sometimes even quite a good level. Especially the sharpness makes at first sight a good impression for the most part and actually acting the 'Mrs. Doubtfire 'picture rarely a little softer. On closer inspection falls on the basis of existing occasionally ghosting and some hard looks of the presentation on but that the image easily sharpened and was also minimal noise filtered. Minimal grain is in place and also a few dirt particles flare up here and there, but the really taboo digital post leaving definite negative traces.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  When it comes to the audio tone, ' Mrs. Doubtfire ' is very satisfactory, and albeit mostly spectacular, which is due to the actual sound design of the film. This comes here, in principle, suitable for the genre of the film, quite front heavy and therefore provides only a few sequences that act a little bit of spatial thanks to the film music and songs and some ambient noise. After scores of sound mix with a good stereo separation which sometimes has a surprisingly good fine detail reproduction, while the balance is quite balanced and excellent intelligibility is guaranteed. It sounds as if the pitch of the dialogue has not been adjusted, but this small and hardly noticeable deficiency becomes rarely noticeable.

This is a really funny hilarious extra, but also very sad at the same time that the talented comedian Robin Williams is no longer with us and a great loss to the comedy world.

Special Feature: On The Set With Euphegenia [1993] [480i] [4:3] [6:12] Once again we go behind-the-scene on location with the film, but we also get more intimate conversations from the likes of Pierce Brosnan [1994/Stu]; Sally Field [1993/Miranda Hillard]; Mathew Lawrence [1994/Chris Hillard]; Chris Columbus [1994/Director]; Robin Williams [1994/Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire] and Harvey Fierstein [1994/Frank].

On the way once again we come into contact with people behind the film and they are as follows: Robin Williams [1994/Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire]; Chris Columbus [1994/Director]; Mathew Lawrence [1994/Chris Hillard]; Lisa Jakub [1993/Lydia Hillard] and Harvey Fierstein [1994/Frank].

Special Feature: Behind-The-Scenes Photo Gallery [1993] [1080p] [16:9] [7:20] Here you get a really nice slide show where you get to view 88 different and interesting images relating to the film. While viewing the images, it would have been nice to have some music playing in the background.

Special Feature: Aging Gracefully: A Look Back At Mrs. Doubtfire [2007] [1080i] [16:9] [13:42] Here we get to see on a sofa Chris Columbus [Director] and Robin Williams [Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire] who talk about the making of the film, that was 10 years ago at the time of recording this video session and it is also a very funny intimate revelation special feature.

Special Feature: ANIMATION STUDIO: A Conversation with Legendary Chuck Jones [1994] [480i] [4:3] [4:16] This is a really nice little feature, because at the start we get to see some extra cartoon footage that was featured at the start of Mrs. Doubtfire where you see Robin Williams trying to dub the voices for the Chuck Jones cartoon. But finally we get to see Chuck Jones talking about how he got involved in the Chris Columbus film. We also get to hear how they wanted Chuck Jones to invent a new cat and bird, which he laughs and says, its like coming up with a new mouse. We also get to see the original pencil test animation. But best of all we get to see Chuck Jones telling us that he felt Robin Williams was a great professional artist and was proud to work with him.

Special Feature: Original Pencil Test [1993] [480i] [4:3] [2:25] With this extra you get to see nearly all of the cartoon, plus you get to hear Robin Williams voice over with the music.

Special Feature: Final Animation Sequence [1993] [480i] [4:3] [5:14] Here you get to see the actual cartoon in full glorious Technicolor and looks stunning, which Chuck Jones excels in. Happy viewing!

Special Feature: Final Animation Sequence with Alternative Background [1993] [480i] [4:3] [5:50] Chuck Jones informs us that this is another version of the cartoon, utilising different colour backgrounds. When Chuck Jones originally completed the cartoon, he felt the original backgrounds were too realistic and did not reflect the Chuck Jones style. But Chris Columbus also informs us that the cartoon was reshot and is now presented in this Blu-ray extra, because Chuck Jones preferred it, and because Chris Columbus thinks it is a fascinating glimpse into the world of animation. Happy viewing!

Special Feature: MAKE-UP DEPARTMENT: Make-Up with Ve Neil [1993] [480i] [4:3] [4:10] Here we get an in-depth look about the long process of turning Robin Williams into Mrs. Doubtfire, with of course the help of the brilliant Ve Neill. And of course we also get contributions from Robin Williams [1994/Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire] and Commentary from Ve Neill [1993/Make-up Artist]. This is really interesting and shows how professional Ve Neill is and also the patient of a saint Robin Williams of going through 3 hours stint to make him look like the fabulous Mrs. Doubtfire.

Special Feature: Make-Up Photo Gallery [1993] [1080p] [16:9] [1:50] Here once again we get another slide show where get to see 22 glorious colourful images of the intricate process of turning Robin Williams into the fabulous Mrs. Doubtfire.

I tell you this is another hilarious funny extra and you will ache with laughter. Happy viewing!

Special Feature: STAGE A: The Improvisation of Mrs. Doubtfire: While filming Mrs. Doubtfire, Director Chris Columbus often encouraged the cast to improvise as a way to heighten the comedy of the film. This feature allows you to view the improvisational abilities of Robin Williams in various scenes from the film. Here you get to view seven different categories and they are as follows: SCENE 26: Another Applicant [1993] [480i] [4:3] [3:33]; SCENE 34HH: A Work In Progress [1993] [480i] [4:3] [3:00]; SCENE 78F: Mrs. Catchfire [1993] [480i] [4:3] [3:10]; SCENE 111B: The Death of Mrs. Doubtfire [1993] [480i] [4:3] [3:45]; SCENE 131: Daniels Show [1993] [480i] [4:3] [8:53]; SCENE 148A: Pitching Mr. Lundy [1993] [480i] [4:3] [6:45] and SCENE 159B: Girlfriends [1993] [480i] [4:3] [7:40].

Special Feature: PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT: Original 1993 Feature: Meet Mrs. Doubtfire [1080i] [16:9/4:3] [5:21] With this extra special video feature, we get a studio session where Robin Williams interviews Mrs. Doubtfire, which of course is done with the very clever split screen trick photography. But in-between you get studio shots and also we get massive clips from the film.

Theatrical Trailers: Theatrical Trailer A [1993] [480i] [4:3] [1:07]; Theatrical Trailer B [1993] [480i] [4:3] [1:59] and Theatrical Trailer C [1993] [480i] [4:3] [1:29]

TV Spots: TV Spot 1 [1993] [480i] [4:3] [00:31] and TV Spot 2 [1993] [480i] [4:3] [00:31]

Theatrical Posters: You get to view just two posters, one entitled Teaser Poster and the other one is entitled Theatrical Poster. But this only lasts about 6 seconds and what a shame they could not have included in this extra some more posters, especially from around the world.

Publicity Photo Gallery: Like the previous slide shows, with this particular one you get to view a total of 100 glorious colour images all relating to all aspects of Mrs. Doubtfire. [1993] [1080p] [16:9] [8:19].

Extra Trailers: Mr. And Mrs. Smith [2004] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:51]; The Devil Wears Prada [2006] [1080p] [16:9] [2:55]; Night At The Museum [2006] [1080p] [16:9] [2:24]; ICE AGE 2: The Meltdown [2005] [1080p] [16:9] [2:09]; ERAGON [2006] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:25] and League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen [2003] [1080p] [2.35:1] [1:04]

Finally, Mrs. Doubtfire provides plenty of hilarious laughs that will make you ache with laughter and a genuine character drama. Most fans of the film will be pleased with this new 2015 Blu-ray release and it features an excellent stunning video transfer, and a very nice 5.1 DTS-HD audio track, and a host of behind-the-scenes bonus extra contents. However, completest will be disappointed by Fox's decision to leave Chris Columbus directors commentary on the cutting room floor. But despite this, I am very proud to finally have this brilliant film in my Blu-ray Collection, and especially starring the brilliant comic genius of Robin Williams.

The cast was excellent and portrayed their parts with honesty.  It was a refreshing change that it didn't end as ""happily ever after"" as we've all come to expect; but was an honest ending; sometimes things in life DON'T work out, no matter how much we want them to or how hard we try to make it so.

549558,5,6303049079,"Just finished watching another Robin Williams movie so naturally I binged and chose to watch another one of his movies. I've seen this movie probably 20 times and it has never gotten old. The comedy is so pure and touching. Yes, it's a ridiculous concept but come on, you have to suspend your disbelief sometimes. The acting is really solid too with Pierce Brosnan playing the perfect role for what the script required. I crack up just thinking about the scene at the restaurant where Robin Williams keeps changing appearances.",1427068800,,527,4.866666666666666

Ratings were different in the early 90's, there are far more swear words than I remember, I guess that's what happens when you watch it with a 6 year old.  She enjoyed it but asked me to fast-forward during the part when the parents argue just prior to separation.  I have watched this movie at least 5 times, probably more.

550802,5,6303049079,I watched this movie so many times when I was younger and loved it immensely now when I revisit it I just want to cry. I miss Robin Williams so much I adore quite a few actors but Robin will never have an equal. On a less depressing note what's not to love about this movie it's not only funny but quite touching and  very entertaining. Plus a father has to be pretty freaking determined to see his kids to undergo a whole woman bodysuit plus makeup I've never encountered someone who would go through such great lengths to see his kids(and his wife of course) more frequently having been divorced. It's a beautiful film one of my favorites. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an appreciation of good film.,1422057600,3,712,4.393939393939394

553000,5,6303049079,"I've never seen this film before. I thought it was going to be sappy and so just skipped it. That was my mistake. The genius to this film is that it lets Robin Williams play two roles in one film. His first role is as the male character, the Dad, who can't stand being separated from his kids. Before you see him transform into their nanny, Mrs. Doubtfire, he shows his male self who is a voice actor. He is voicing an animation as we open. This means every time we see Williams in the male role he has got the opportunity to do all of his comedic riffing and voices. When his brother (Harvey Fierstein), a makeup man, is making him into a woman Williams even gets a chance to mimic famous women in drag. His Barbra Streisand is magnificent.

When he transforms into Mrs. Doubtfire, he becomes an aged Englishwoman who nevertheless has a wicked streak to her, especially when it comes to Pierce Brosnan, his ex-wife's new boyfriend. As Doubtfire, he sabotages the boyfriend left and right plus hits him with zingers at every turn. Doubtfire also becomes closer to the  ex who is played by Sally Field. One mistake the film never makes is that it never turns into a sappy love story b etween Fields and Williams. The accent is that he wants his kids back. There are always doubts about whether the two of them could ever be a successful couple again.

For those who were fans of Mork, this is the closest Williams comes to bringing him back in one of his films.

While there is a lot of humor for adults it doesn't get vulgar, at least by today's standards.  When the news broke out about Robin Williams passing. I thought of him as a standup Comic in the early 80s, My Grandmother (a teacher) loved him in Dead Poets Society, My mom loved him in Mork & Mindy, My Dad loved him in Good Morning Vietnam.  He creaped my wife out in One Hour Photo, My kids knew him as Mrs. Doubtfire. They asked if we could rent it and so we streamed the movie and laughed and cried.  Afterwards my 15 year old daughter asked me how could someone so funny be so sad?  I don't know but he has left us with a wealth of treasures that will at least pick us up when we are sad.

553962,5,6303049079,"The Greatest Performance EVER

I am now 88 years old. My parents could not afford a ""babysitter during the 1930 depression, so they sent me to the local movie houses, (which at that time was less than 25cents admission) for children under the age of 10.
(The movie theaters then opened as early as 9AM and I usually went home about 3PM.)

I was mesmerized by what I saw on the screen and I actually learned a lot from some of the life stories that I saw on the screen in those early days.  At the age of 10 I also had my ""favorite actor,"" who was Paul Muni.

Starting at that early age, I saw most of the greatest actors and also learned a great deal of ""History"" from what I saw on the screen. You can't say that today.

Recently I bought the ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". DVD and I have never seen a more mind-blowing GREATER actor as the late ROBIN WILLIAMS performance in ""Mrs. Doubfire.

I have recently bought multiple (DVD) copies (from Amazon) of the extraordinary  Robin Williams's performance in Mrs. Doubfire for lifetime gifts for as long as my remaining days.

But, I don't see a refund for last weekend's watch failure.  AND, no matter how many minutes I've spent searching HELP for options to ask for help/refund with this topic, I find nothing.  It's very well hidden or non-existent.  No search has turned up the directions I need for my little $3.24 refund.  Like I said, it's happened before but Amazon always sends me an e-mail indicating a credit will be applied before I even have a chance to let them know it happened.

554892,4,6303049079,"""Mrs. Doubtfire"" may be the most beloved character Robin Williams ever created. Watching his transformation from Daniel, a regular guy in the middle of a divorce, to the hip old Scottish nanny is fun no matter how many times you've seen it. Daniel does voices for cartoon characters in the movies. He and his wife Miranda have divorced, and in order to continue seeing his kids every day, he decides to invent the perfect nanny, and arranges things so that Miranda will interview only him. Luckily, his brother also deals in make believe; he's a professional makeup artist. He and his partner try many different looks and styles before they find the winner. This sequence is fun, but it also shows how much work goes into creating a mask, makeup and hairstyles. In real life it isn't done in exactly this way, but that's OK. Later on we see the body suit, padding; every part of this very elaborate disguise. It's a lot of work, but if the payoff is getting to spend every afternoon with the children, it's well worth it.

The children, pre-teens Lydia and Chris, and the 5-year-old Natalie, don't want a nanny. They want their father to look after them, and they get their wish, although they don't know it. Mrs. Doubtfire is firm but fair. She runs a tight ship, requiring the kids to do their homework, but helping them with it, too. She puts elegant dinners on the table, keeps the house spotless, takes the kids on outings -- she's too good to be true. Daniel is a better father as Mrs. Doubtfire than he was as himself. Eventually, Mrs. Doubtfire and Daniel are in the same room at the same time. Miranda, the kids and her new boyfriend are at one end of a fancy restaurant, and a man Daniel is interviewing with about a starring in a new TV show is at the other. Robin Williams has to go back and forth across the restaurant, playing Mrs. Doubtfire one minute and Daniel the next. There is only one way this sequence can end, and that is for one of them to land at the wrong table. All turns out well in the end, however, and while ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is very funny, giving Robin Williams the chance to use all his talents, it's also a celebration of family.

Robin portrays a very loving,  albeit occasionally shortsighted in the expectations of the adult world, father who wants nothing less than all the time in the world with his 3 wonderful children. His wife and polar opposite, played by Sally Fields, wants more of a mature husband and less of a 4th child to support.
If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing Mrs. Doubtfire, I strongly urge the viewer to bring milk, cookies,  and a fresh box of kleenex. This movie will stay with you. It's truly one of Robin's most endearing roles. (RIP:Never forgotten Robin.)",1409616000,,580,4.732673267326732

555130,5,6303049079,"We have watched this movie countless times, and every time we watch it again, we still enjoy the laugh-out-loud entertainment. Robin Williams played the role of not only a loving father with a big heart, but a disguised nanny, who his ex-wife hires when in need of a house-keeper. His perfect plan was to get the live-in nanny job, so that he would remain closer to his 3 children. The movie portrays Robin Williams not only as the funny guy, but as the down-to-earth caring guy, who had enough love in him for the entire family.

Sally Fields plays the ex-wife, who is very serious, and the complete opposite of her ex-husband. The 3 adorable children missed their father, and began to hurt emotionally, when 'Mrs. Doubtfire' was fired, and was forced to leave their home. It took his ex-wife a while to realize how much their children were missing their father, finally realizing that they needed love from both parents.

The funny and sometimes hysterical laughs from certain scenes as we watch the stunts that Robin Williams plans, combined with heartwarming scenes, created a very enjoyable, and entertaining movie. This was one of the best for Robin Williams. Acting performance was superb. Highly recommended!",1409356800,,1216,4.926829268292683

555245,5,6303049079,"I'd forgotten how emotionally-draining this film could be. Its poignant portrayal of a couple who have grown apart and are separating, which sets up the premise of the film, is tear jerking for the Robin Williams' character's reaction to the split. Of course, it's also a fun, rollicking ride with Williams' as the cross-dressing nanny, but the real emotion that drives his actions keeps the story propelled forward so that you can't help but to cheer for him and his kids. Just wonderful. A must-see if, like me, you're now on a journey to explore every film Williams' has ever done; am missing him terribly and this was terrific salve for my sadness.",1409270400,,652,4.778761061946903

Then, after he does a series of ""voices"" for her, she tells him, ""...do you consider yourself to be humorous, Mr. Hillard?"" and he tells her, ""...I used to.  There was a time when I thought of myself as funny.  But, today you have proven me wrong, and for that, I thank you.""

555470,5,6303049079,"Mrs. Doubtfire is about a father who works as a voice actor that disguised as a sixty-year old nanny wanted to spend more time with his children after the courts awarded full custody to his ex-wife and was only allowed a spend time weekly with them. This was a humorous film from beginning to end.

Robin Williams definitely delivered both as a physical comedy actor moving in and out of the drag and elicited a lot of laughter when he said numerous funny lines. Aside from that,it also happens to be a family oriented film as the viewer will definitely feel for the couple who are headed for a divorce and the children who loves their father so much but gets a little time to spend with him. Added to that,we also get to see a realistic screenplay for most part except of course when Daniel is able to fool the people around him as Mrs. Doubtfire for most part. The predicaments that the family members is heartwarming and the emotions that they are feeling will touch the viewer no end. Aside from Williams,Sally Field must also be given credit for being a great in the role of Daniel's ex-wife,Miranda.

This was arguably the funniest film that the late Robin Williams ever made and one of the movies that he will be remembered for after he passed away more than a week ago.",1408838400,,1277,4.476394849785407

555711,4,6303049079,"I watched this this week, after last week's tragic events, so my review may be biased, but I don't think so. Robin Williams was the consummate comedian and dramatic actor. I loved what great lengths his character went to in order to see his kids, and of course as a forensic artist, I always love SFX make-up. I read an article that said that the 'face cream/meringue dropping into the social worker's tea' scene was improvised when Robin (or the room) was too warm and the cream started melting from his face. That was Robin. King of Improv. You will be sorely missed, friend.",1408665600,,577,4.5576923076923075

Mrs. Doubtfire says to the bus driver, ""Well, He broke the mold when He made me dear. He made me very special."" To which the bus driver responds, ""He sure did."" We love you Robin and will never ever forget your brilliance as an actor, comedian, and humanitarian.

This movie has been a favorite of mine since I was a kid, and is a wonderful family movie that shows kids that it's OK to be part of a broken home or other ""unusual"" circumstance. Great message, great comedy, great movie. Show it to your kids.",1408665600,,646,4.428571428571429

556345,5,6303049079,"Robin Williams and the supporting cast are amazing. This is a true classic. I watched it with my partner and her eight-year-old son. We both thought that it would be a good family movie. We ended up fast forwarding over a bed of it. I hadn't anticipated how the content about the divorce, and the custody issues might impact our eight-year-old. I noticed that he looked sad at the beginning of the movie, and I asked him whether he wanted me to fast forward to just the funny parts and he said yes. We didn't end up watching the ending, because I thought that having him see the reunion of the family wasn't the best content for him to watch. I had never looked at the movie through and eight-year-olds eyes who may have been through some of that, and may still have wishes that his parents would reunite on some level.",1408233600,,819,4.394736842105263

Mrs. Doubtfire herself is a conduit to the soft, gentle side of Robin Williams that we have been reading about lately.  My daughter and I happened to watch this movie (and ""The Bird Cage"") a week before he passed; as a result, she had a real sense of his gifts and what a tragedy it is to lose them.  Anyway, this movie is great family entertainment because it shows two divorcing adults (plus one new boyfriend) who put the needs of the kids first.

556903,5,6303049079,"As I write this, I found out that our beloved, multi-talented, loving, awesome comedian Robin Williams just passed away at the age of 63.  :(  It was so sad to hear about that too.  Which is why I'm commenting on this movie.

""Mrs. Doubtfire"" was my favorite Robin Williams movie, hands down.  He really delivered on a lot of his lines -- and I especially loved the rest of the cast:  most notably Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan.  A divorced husband, Robin is scared to lose his children to his ex-wife, so what does he do??  He decides to apply for a nanny position; he tricks his ex-wife by transforming into Mrs. Doubtfire!  He even manages to fool his own boss.

I loved the kitchen scene where Robin was trying to make some dinner but the frying pan and the stove kept getting on fire (along with his wardrobe!!).  He couldn't put it out, so naturally, he orders from a very expensive local restaurant.  But Sally didn't know that!!!  Robin also becomes jealous when Pierce enters the picture; he thinks that he's trying to hit on Sally, so his first order of business is to get him out of the picture!

He has the restaurant kitchen staff put some spice on Pierce's entre.  The minute that Pierce chokes on some shrimp, it's ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" to the rescue!  After performing the Heimlich maneuver, ""Mrs. Doubtfire's"" mask starts to peel off.  And Sally is aghast when she finds out that ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is actually her ex-husband!  I truly enjoyed the shock/paralysis facial expression on Sally's face!!  She could NEVER duplicate that kind of scene -- and to throw fuel to the fire, she chanted ""the whole time, the whole time -- the WHOLE TIME!!"" with such anger and venom.  Sally Field is truly a class of her own right (most noted in 1989's ""Steel Magnolias"").

This is a movie that I've watched over 15 times, and I NEVER get sick of it.  If you are a Robin Williams fan, you definitely need to purchase and/or stream this title.  :)",1407801600,5,1945,4.54178674351585

Living in the Bay Area, it was hard not to have met him a few times, and all I can say is what a wonderful human being.

556907,4,6303049079,"I could not believe the news when I heard that Robin Williams had committed suicide at 63 years old. He was a very funny entertainer in comedy, in laughter but also as a generous human being. It is so sad that whenever someone that young and talented ends their own life. His personal comedy hasn't been as good as it was back in the 80's and 90's, and whatever he was on film or television, he definitely was a unique and brilliant gentleman. Yet, the past few years I definitely do not think Robin had ever got over the strives he had dealt with from losing his sitcom The Crazy Ones and not being renewed, to his marriages failing and going into depression and addiction. But what he did on the big screen in so many films in the 90's like Jumanji, Hook, and Good Will Hunting showed a generous side out of a brilliant comedian and a remarkable actor. One of my favorite films showed that a man can definitely be as a soft as woman.

Mrs. Doubtfire is definitely one of those films that I have definitely adored from Robin as a man gripping with a divorce, still being desperate to have a relationship with his kids and be a father. Robin delivered so well in the film, and showed a side of Robin that can deliver. He got so desperate to have a relationship with being a dad to his kids, that he dresses up as a old-fashioned nanny to still remain to be a dad. The film is absolutely funny and shows that Robin delivers well at heart. It is a great film and one that shows that desperation can come through from the heart. All the slapstick Robin had shown in the film still is absolutely funny, as shows that regardless of what parents go through losing marriage and touch with love, their needs simply needs to be a bond for the sake of the loved one. Sally Field and Robin had really good chemistry in the film, and it still shows after all this time, the classics haven't gone away.

Overall, Robin Williams was a remarkable gem, and the way I want to remember him not just for what he went through, but as a caring individual that really had a gift of caring for others. Whether it was giving back for the troops, Comic Relief, or helping with the sadness of losing his friend Christopher Reeve after being severely injured to a horse-riding accident. But with all that aside, the way I want Robin Williams to be remembered is a funny gentleman who could make you laugh no matter what age, sex, or whatever you are going through in life, you can still have a balance of love. This is my favorite role, Robin has showcased in the movies, and this is a great buy for anyone who had just been introduced to Robin and his untimely loss.

557106,4,6303049079,"While this is without a doubt one of Robin Williams's better comedies, I like the man better in more dramatic roles where he subtly inserts his humor (i.e. Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting.)  But as a comedy, this is still a very good film and it does allow Williams to go a bit more over-the-top than some of his other projects have.  A prime example is his multiple phone calls as various different characters considered unsuitable by the poor soul at the other end of the line.  As for the rest of the cast, they were definitely the collective straight-man to Williams's continuous unpredictability.  Well, that applies to almost everyone...one couple is exempt.  Ultimately, my biggest problem in the film is that, while Robin Williams and his on-screen wife, Sally Field, are obviously unhappy (the divorce is a clue there), we never get a glimpse into what they're losing.  Weren't these two happy with each other at one point?  They had to be, right?  They got three kids out of it, didn't they?  But in the end, it's still a very funny film that kids and parents can watch together.  Enjoy.",1404259200,2,1103,4.697916666666667

557110,4,6303049079,"""Mrs Doubtfire"" is a watered-down version of ""Tootsie"" -- an actor has professional problems (he's ""too serious"" about his work, alienating people), and disguises himself as a woman to obtain employment. In the process of pretending to be someone he isn't, the actor develops a better understanding of himself and his relationship with other people.

""Tootsie"" is rightly considered a classic (it was one of the films analyzed in my screenwriting class), primarily because it's built around the millennia-old issue of how men and women relate to each other, and we accept the preposterous situation, because it is not, per se, the story's focus. ""Mrs Doubtfire"" is about the narrower concern of the place of the wife and husband in a marriage, and how it affects their children. The initial situation is realistic, but the events growing out of are contrived.

""Mrs Doubtfire"" can't decide whether it's a drama about divorce, or a cross-dressing farce. It succeeds almost perfectly at the latter (despite too many scenes of Williams switching his costume), but largely fails at the former. Both Daniel and Miranda need to make attitude adjustments -- he recognizing that he can be an adult with his children (and they'll still love him), she acknowledging that she has largely abandoned her children for her career, and has no right to complain that he's giving the kids the attention they crave. Daniel's change is well-dramatized (eg, when Mrs D tosses the TV remote in the fishtank and insists the kids do their homework), but Miranda's is not. Sally Field's character wavers between firmness and sentimentality, without any plausible conflict. (I ascribe this to Chris Columbus's weak directing. A better director (and possibly a better script) would have found a better balance between the drama and the comedy.)

Robin Williams' makeup is nothing short of startling, rightly winning the Makeup Oscar. Nevertheless, we're expected to believe that, like Clark Kent, his disguise is impenetrable. Williams' voice is instantly recognizable (even when doing impressions), and Mrs Doubtfire is so obviously Williams-in-drag that one wonders how his wife and children could be fooled for more than a few seconds.

There are two major technical errors. The dialog for an animated film is recorded //before// the drawings are made. Cosmetic appliances (especially ones as complex as Daniel's) usually take hours to apply, and are normally thrown away after a single use.

The PG-13 rating is for vulgar and sexually suggestive language that's appropriate for the story. This is not a film for pre-teens.

The Blu-ray image is grainless and creamy-smooth. If there's a loss of sharpness and detail, it isn't obvious or bothersome. There's a lot of supplemental material, including multiple takes of Williams ad-libbing.

I have no problem recommending ""Mrs Doubtfire"" for a single viewing. But (for me) it's not one of those ""annual viewing required"" films.",1402444800,4,2953,5.230443974630021

557578,5,6303049079,"Robin Williams is the king of the slapstick comedy.  He just knows how to move his body and alter his voice and play to every one of his strengths.  That isn't to say that every one of his films works, but he has a knack for creating these characters we can't help but love.

Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire is one of those characters.

Personally, I love this film in all of its silly, schmaltzy ridiculousness.  It is fun and entertaining and heartwarming on many levels.  After Daniel Hillard's reckless behavior moves his uptight yet overworked wife Miranda to push for separation, he feels overwhelmed by the lack of time he is allowed to see his children.  Miranda is unmoved by his pleas, since she considers him incapable of taking care of them.  So, he resorts to a last ditch effort, which seems to work.  He undergoes extensive `creature makeup' to become a woman.  He becomes Mrs. Doubtfire, a strict, fun loving house keeper hired by Miranda to watch the kids while she is at work or out on the town with her new boyfriend, the suave Stu Denmeyer.

Williams is hilarious as Daniel, capturing more than a mere gimmick (sure, he plays up the gimmick for sure) but actually infusing so much heart and humanity into his portrayal.  You believe his every plea, and when he breaks down about the love he has for his kids and the need he has to see them, your heart breaks.  Field, Brosnan, Lawrence, Jakub and Wilson are also great here, adding to a collectively effective ensemble.  The makeup is believable and hilarious, and the gags feel fresh even during the fiftieth viewing.  This is a film that warrants multiple viewings, not because it is required to understand the film but because it is just so much fun!

Not to mention the fact that it's given us a slew of glorious catch-phrases!",1371081600,,1795,4.615141955835962

Williams is classically funny in a way that no one else is and he shows again in Mrs. Doubtfire. Separated from his children in a divorce, he needs a way to see his kids every day, and the idea of Mrs. Doubtfire is born. The cast is a mix of veteran comedy actors and young kids and they all do a phenomenal job. Williams of course is genius and makes the film, in a role that is clearly written for him.

That judge would've been in deep trouble with the gay community had it been real life. Why does no one else mention this in their comments? Cause if it has been mentioned anywhere, I sure missed it! All that aside, overall, I do still adore this film.

557799,5,6303049079,"If you thought Robin Williams was just a short, furry man doing great voices, you'd be wrong.  Robin Williams is a genius.

Daniel (Robin Williams) is a husband and father, and he is a giant man-child.  His wife, Miranda finally has enough and declares she wants a divorce.  Since she brings home the bacon, she gets custody of the kids.  Daniel is desperate to see his kids and devises a way to do just that: by becoming a housekeeper (with the help of a body suit and a mask).

Mrs. Doubtfire is wonderfully charming and one of the most fun family movies.  It suits the kids, it suits the adults...it's a little of everything.  The cast is phenomenal and the script is very intelligent for a family movie.  I love it, love it, love it!",1338940800,,737,4.4
557800,1,6303049079,"A free spirit 'brave' enough to stand up to the expectations of the world - he has his integrity you see - can't hold a job or a marriage (which seems like a useful lesson).  But, instead of man-ing up, getting a job, and doing the things a dad is supposed to do, he embarks on a campaign of lies and deceit, aimed at not only his ex-wife, but his own kids, trying to take a short-cut to Fatherhood.  Hilarity ensues.  Or rather, as you should be able to imagine of a movie made primarily to showcase Robin Williams' vacuous stream-of-consciousness 'comedy,' it doesn't.  Besides the execrable premise, the moviemaking isn't very good.  Situations are contrived and ridiculous, the cast, even Sally Field who is usually an inoffensive and workmanlike actress, fails to achieve any chemistry, and the comic timing is hit-or-miss.  And there is a string of profanity in one scene that's definitely not for kids, who are the only demographic unlearned enough to buy the rest of the movie.  Bad movie.  Horrible message.  Run away.

That was the first of the more darker sided humor of Robin's talents. But THIS movie here, to me was the very best. Patch Adams was good, but too much of a psycotic rollercoaster to really enjoy like Mrs. Doubtfire. If you have not seen this movie, or you have and was not sure how you felt, it is worth another viewing.",1337040000,,459,4.168539325842697
557856,5,6303049079,"I love Robin Williams, and this is a good example of why. Daniel Hillard (Williams) is doing the voices -- all the voices -- for a cartoon as the movie begins. The canary has been singing Figaro, the cat catches him, and rather than permit him a phone call as he requests, offers him a last cigarette. Hillard ad-libs an anti-smoking message for the canary, and the director is furious. Hillard points out that as a cartoon, it is aimed at children, and promoting smoking on a children's movie is unethical. He's told to do the script the way it was written or take a hike. He takes the latter option.

So he's home early, can create a birthday party for his son, and make enough mess for his wife Miranda (Sally Field) to blow her top and ask for a divorce. Well, he did make quite an awful mess, but really!

Anyway, once she's kicked him out, and gotten custody of the three children, and a court order that Daddy sees them only on Saturdays, she needs a housekeeper. After all, she's a successful career woman and can't do everything herself. However, she has the ad copy with her when she comes to pick up the kids at his chaotic apartment, and he manages to change a couple of numbers so that she gets no legitimate calls. Then he calls with a variety of fake voices and successfully creates the impression that only seriously unsuitable people are answering the ad. Then he calls and makes an appointment for an interview for Mrs. Doubtfire.

Fortunately, Daniel's brother is a theatrical makeup artist, really very good at it, and after half a dozen hilarious attempts, comes up with just the right transformation into the dumpy but lovable British Mrs. Doubtfire. Of course she is hired.

No, I have not told you too much. This is just the background to the funniest situation you can imagine. There's some predictable elements, but enough Robin Williams twists to keep you laughing so hard you'll find it hard to breathe. As the perfect ""straight man"" to the best of the jokes Pierce Brosnan plays Stuart, an old boyfriend of Miranda's who comes back into her life and seems prepared to settle down with the whole family. He's wealthy, charming, of course very attractive, and just the perfect foil for some of Robin Williams' best jokes.",1336867200,,2248,4.6125

557859,4,6303049079,"For April Fool's Day ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" seems an appropriate viewing choice.  This film concerns a divorced father Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) who due to irresponsible behavior has limited visitation rights to his three children.  This is unacceptable to him. So when Daniel finds out his ex-wife Miranda (Sally Field) is advertising for a housekeeper, he sabotages the ad, changing the phone #.  He has his brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), a theatrical make up artist come up with literally a new face and look, and voila he's a cozy, grey haired, elderly, soft spoken English matron known as Mrs. Doubtfire.  He completely fools Miranda and the children, and is given the job.  As Mrs. Doubtfire, he is a positive influence on them all, including himself; he becomes a better more responsible individual.  However, Daniel still harbors unrealistic dreams that the family will get back together for the sake of his being with his children, despite the fact that Miranda has moved on with her life.  So, when Miranda starts seeing a handsome, wealthy former boyfriend Stu Dunmeyer (Pierce Brosnan) who gets along well with the children Daniel in his guise of Mrs. Doubtfire jealously does all he can to sabotage the relationship.

When I first saw this film back when it opened in November 1993, I liked it all right, but I thought Robin Williams was way over the top at times, and needed to be reeled in.  While I still think at times there is too much showboating by Williams, after several viewings over the years, I've mellowed I guess and appreciate the film more.  Williams does a very good job delineating the two characters, and his Mrs. Doubtfire is a very believable characterization, he's assisted by excellent makeup and wardrobe of course.

The movie, while definitely a comedy that has its share of slapstick and farcical moments, does in director Christopher Columbus' vision try to deal realistically with the pain of divorce in a family.  This is true particularly in the performances of the three children Lydia (Lisa Jakobs), Chris (Matthew Lawrence) and Natalie (Mara Wilson).  Young Ms. Jakobs is especially effective in bringing out the confusion and conflict in her character even more so in several deleted scenes in which she registers very strongly.  These deleted scenes, which are of one of the excellent special features offered show a film that is much darker in the hurt and anger the children feel at the conflict between their parents during the divorce.  Don't worry though, the finished film is not a downer, and the final resolution is one is which there is a certain hope as evidenced by the title of the review, that their relationship as a family will continue to be strong, and perhaps better even if they can't all live together.  And as I said, earlier, you'll get plenty of laughs.

Most of the time I felt sympathy for Sally Field's Miranda Hillard, having to be the grown up and rule enforcer in the home, in contrast to Daniel's free wheeling free spirit.  Pierce Brosnan does a nice job in a basically thankless part as Stu, but he does get to execute a skillful dive off the high board and exhibit a fine if hirsute physique which would serve him well in his forthcoming role as the new James Bond. Good support is given too by Harvey Fierstein as Daniel's sympathetic brother Frank, Anne Haney as Daniel's stern court liaison, Mrs. Sellner,  Robert Prosky as Mr. Lundy, Daniel's new boss, and Sydney Walker as a bus driver that is attracted to Mrs. Doubtfire.  Regrettably that good comic actress Polly Holliday as Gloria, the Hillards garden loving neighbor, largely wound up on the cutting room floor as you again can see in the deleted scenes.",1333238400,,3698,4.85828025477707

557862,4,6303049079,"When Robin Williams is on his game, it's as good as comedy gets.  And when he's off, or spinning out of control, it's literally unwatchable, but that's a topic for another day.  Fortunately he brings his A Game to MRS. DOUBTFIRE, a timeless comic caper featuring Williams in drag as an elderly British nanny.  It's like putting a fish in fresh water; Williams thrives in this environment, offering countless hilarious lines and gimmicks.  Case in point, while cooking in his garb he accidentally sets his fake bosoms on fire, forcing him to put them out with two pan lids while lamenting, ""My first day as a woman, and I'm already getting hot flashes!""

Funny stuff.

As a bonus, MRS. DOUBTFIRE is more than a vehicle for Williams' antics; it's also a very poignant and tender story, as the comic plays an estranged father willing to stop at nothing to spend more time with his beloved children.  Naturally dressing in drag and pretending to be a woman goes beyond the pale, so when the ruse is discovered Williams' character has a severe price to pay, and his pain is heartfelt.  Yet everything resolves with a feel-good ending and a chance for redemption.  The rest of the cast is topnotch, including Sally Field as the frustrated ex and Pierce Brosnan as Field's suitor (and subsequently Williams' antagonist).  Granted, it's impossible for Williams not to be over the top on occasion, and he does so here, but it's all in good fun.  Sure, Williams has made a plethora of fine comedies, but I'm hard-pressed to think of any funnier than MRS. DOUBTFIRE.

A movie that should go down as one of Robin Williams best pictures.  The story is very interesting, touching and has a lot of meaning to it.  Again, it just depends on the comedy, even though some might be weird, it might still be entertaining, for example the naked gun movies.  Mrs. Doubtfire I think is really in it's own league in that it is quite funny, entertaining and has a touching story to it.

557907,4,6303049079,"I watched Mrs. Doubtfire again with my kids recently. They didn't remember seeing it when they were younger and now that they are adults, it has a slightly different meaning to them anyway.

The basic story is a mother and father are getting a divorce, and the father is given limited visitation and time with his kids, but he misses them and wants to spend more time with them, to see them grow up and to know what they are doing. Plus, part of him probably wants to keep tabs on mom and the family too, from the inside. So, since this father is an actor of sorts--though not really a successful one--he dresses up in stage makeup and costume and becomes a housekeeper/babysitter and applies for the job his wife has posted to help take care of the kids. And he gets the job too.

Then some hilarious stuff ensues as he tries to hide his true identity from the kids and the wife, while also becoming important to the kids and a near best-friend to the wife. That is, until they discover who he really is.

It has a happy ending, but I won't spoil the ending here.

There are some funny moments. It's not what I would consider Robin Williams's finest moments, but there are some chuckle-worthy moments. It's got a lot of slapstick nature to it as well.

Honestly, it's not a spectacular movie, but it's a good, feel-good family movie that you probably won't mind your younger kids watching and that you might enjoy some too.",1325548800,,1424,4.440613026819923

Robin Williams is fantastic as usual and at times I swear you'll actually believe he is a little old woman. It's funny, and heartwarming reflects upon a sad but often best for children type senerio when parents just cannot get along any longer and don't want to see their kids suffer because of it. So they split up and split custody. Which isn't the best of situations for anyone involved, but sometimes marriages just don't work out. Robin Williams character comes up with a solution for that problem. I gave it five stars, as Sally Fields, as well as all the supporting actors and actresses did a wonderful job as well.

""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is centered around a family that is struggling through a divorce. Daniel Hillard is an actor who ""does voices."" His wife is a home designer who believes Daniel takes things too far and that they having nothing in common.
Mrs. Hillard files for divorce. Daniel not able to stand being away from his kids dresses as a 60 year old lady so he can be the house sitter for his wife.

558118,5,6303049079,"In my opinion, one of Robin Williams' best films...and I mean it when I say it's his film all the way. What might have been a one-joke idea about a flaky, unemployed Dad who has a radical makeover in order to be near his kids, Williams makes it an engaging & fun journey, with a sincere & heartful message about why parents sometimes must divorce. The young actors who play Williams' kids are adorable without being precocious, the sturdy ""out"" actor Harvey Fierstein is terrific as his doting make-up artist brother, and the wonderful Sally Field is tops as his estranged wife, a strong actress who can hold her own quite well against Williams' manic genius.
It takes a good comic actor to make a fictional character like Mrs. Doubtfire seem amusing, sympathetic and, above all, tangible. Even in the heart-rending scenes in which Williams expresses his need to be near his children, you feel for him.
Another triumph for both Williams & director Chris Columbus...and a must-have comedy!",1256774400,,988,4.85207100591716

I don't see anybody else doing this movie like that except for him because of the way he is and everything.

This is the kind of movie that I can watch over and over again and still enjoy it. To this day I still genuinely laugh at the things Robin Williams does as Mrs. Doubtfire.

558184,5,6303049079,"This movie takes a hopeless premise,and mixes in two actors - Robin Williams and Sally Fields - who are so dissimilar in their talents that their pairing should be D.O.A., and pulls out a surprisingly funny and effective movie. I am stunned at the quality.  Understand that Robin Williams has very limited range to his acting. See the opening scenes of Mrs. Doubtfire where he quits his job -dubbing voices into cartoons - over a trivial moral issue. Is the scene convincing? Does he appear to have the right level of passion to truly walk out on his job? No. As an actor, he is merely Robin Williams in his films. But his manic side really distinguishes him from any other actor alive.  Sally Field, however, is a great actress (and greatly unappreciated, too.) She has the range to do almost anything - but cracking jokes is not her forte, and manic is not within her range at all.  So what happens? Robin is enormously funny when he is getting his makeup applied by Harvey Fierstein, gigging the court-appointed monitor, and tormenting Pierce Brosnan. But in the Robin-only scenes, the film stands still -as if he is doing a stand-up routine.  But when Sally is on-camera, the story moves.... and there is emotional power in the scenes. She is dead-on convincing in almost every scene, in almost every emotional state. She tells no jokes and creates a realness and a context that brings the best out of Robin's emoting. There would be no movie without Robin, but it is Sally that makes the movie something much more than Three Men and A Baby.  Even Pierce Brosnan works - in an unusual twist he plays a male version of the type of role that many gorgeous actresses are accustomed to play - his role is simply to be good-looking and charming so that other characters can be jealous or lust-filled. And yet, even he shows 3-dimensionality to his character, with the help of some sensitive script-writing.  So its a triumph - a genuinely interesting and fun film. Bravo!",1222560000,2,1970,4.662824207492795

The story in brief, Miranda (Sally Field) is a career woman who's tired of coming home tired from working hard and cleaning up after her actor husband, Daniel (Robin Williams) and their three children.  After a particularly disastrous birthday party for their son that got the police called for a noise complaint, she throws Daniel out and demands a divorce.

This breaks Daniel and the kids' hearts, particularly when he can only see them once a week on Saturdays.  He offers to take care of the kids after school and Miranda the court decline.

When Daniel learns that Miranda is going to hire a housekeeper, he decides to become that housekeeper.  With the help of his brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), Mrs. Doubtfire is born.

Daniel does such a convincing job as Mrs. D that neither the kids nor Miranda realize it's him.  The problem comes in when Stu Dunmeyer (Pierce Brosnan) enters the picture and restart a once-dead relationship with Miranda.

Robin Williams literally makes this show.  I remember back when the movie was first announced, I heard he was walking around Seattle as Mrs. Doubtfire interacting with unwary (and very lucky) citizens.  In the making of secion, the cast comment that there is no Robin in Mrs. Doubtfire.  Many times even knowing who the character was they thought she was a she.

""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is just a brilliant and well-acted tale and always good for a laugh. I recommend this extended version over the others because it does have some fun deleted scenes.",1199491200,11,1729,4.761744966442953

558378,1,6303049079,"I simply can't believe the number of reviews that call this a ""family"" film--the way that Williams' character treats his wife in this movie is one of the most disgusting spectacles I've ever seen, and the kids are witness to it all.  We're supposed to sympathize with a character who is not only is completely irresponsible, but also destructive and manipulative, and we're supposed to see Fields' character as the bad guy?  Sorry--it just doesn't work.  This movie is simply a way for all those immature, infantile men out there who have been left by their wives to say, ""See--that's what I'm going through!"" (And I say that knowing full well that not all divorces are caused by these dynamics, but that many are, so save your angry comments about how unfair the statement is.)  The simple fact is that if Fields' character hadn't left him, the children would have been much more negatively affected by the way their father acted and her acceptance of that behavior.

This all is not to mention that the comedy here is sadly unoriginal and derivative.  The scene in the restaurant is horribly contrived, for example, and not at all believable.  I'm a huge fan of the suspension of disbelief, but this movie makes you put your dunce cap on to accept some of the ""comic"" situations as actually being funny, even though virtually ALL of them can be traced to other movies in which they've been done much better.

All in all, this was one of the few movies I've ever watched that has made me angry at filmmakers for presenting a situation that is incredible devastating to many people and stacking the deck in favor of the character who actually has caused the horrible situation, but who feels wronged, so the audience feels he has been wronged, too.

558427,5,6303049079,"Robin Williams in this movie unfolds, for once more, the charisma he has for comedy. His transforming to Mrs. Doubtfire undoubtly brings to mind Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie. Still this is an original movie since Robin Williams does not do it to launch his carrer as an actor, or to win the heart of a woman but he does it to be close to his children.

The movie is hillarious with timeless funny scenes. Pierce Brosnan seems to feel awkward with the things Robin Williams does and you wonder whether he is just acting or he is REALLY feeling this way since Robin Williams does not seem to follow the script but he does his own things. On the same note the kids (especially the youngest one) give you the impression that they are genuinely amused with the things Robin Williams does.

THe movie is filmed in San Fransisco, which along with New York is my favourite city for shooting films. A very entairtening movie with very positive messages about parenthood or even more specific fatherhood. At the end of the movie you come to love and sympathize with Robin Williams accepting him for what he is: A man with wicknesses but with devotion to his children.",1161561600,2,1154,4.570048309178744
558428,5,6303049079,"Why Robin Williams can't get an Oscar nod for his specialty (comedy) is beyond me.  He's been nominated numerous times, and actually won, for his dramatic roles, but to me Williams will always shine much brighter when making us laugh.  To me, arguably his greatest role was that of Daniel Hillard, a very irresponsible married man, father of three, whose wife Miranda (Field) finally has enough and puts him out.  In an attempt to see more of his children he disguises himself as Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire, an elderly woman who is hired to take care of the children while their mother is at work.  William's is genius as he frantically switches between Daniel and Euphegenia, trying to, through Mrs. Doubtfire, win back his wife and deter her from Stu (Bosnan), the new man in her life.  Hysterical from start to finish, `Mrs. Doubtfire' is a sure fire crowd pleaser.",1160006400,3,867,4.791946308724833

Robin Williams is fantastic.  He is so talented and it shows right from the very start when he's in a recording studio to voice over the cartoon.  The range of his talents is astounding.  His talent for creating different voices and just being so silly that you laugh is amazing.

When he separates from his wife and can't get to see his kids until he gets a suitable job etc, he goes to big extremes to get quality time with them - he totally transforms himself into a female nanny.

However, the message behind this movie is a bit immature; this tries to put a positive spin on divorce, which maybe just can't have a decent positive spin at all.  If you actually follow the story, yes, the wife should be able to get a divorce; the husband's attempts to thwart their divorce would have been much better spent trying to win back the favor of the wife.  And it's not that funny.  If anyone could make it work, it would be Robin Williams, but not even he can make divorce funny.  If you're trying to help a kid through their parents' divorce, maybe watch this one.  Otherwise, look for Robin Williams as the Genie in Disney's Aladdin or as Batty in Fern Gully, for something fun that all ages enjoy.",1147564800,5,796,4.417808219178082

However I can't give this top marks because the attmepts to be ""moving"" often made me wince in embarrasment. The biggest gripe though is that Mrs Doubtfire claims to be from England yet speaks with a Scottish accent. It would be similar if an ""American"" nanny came to England and claimed to be from New York yet spoke with a Texas accent. Even a Brit would know the difference. Are Americans really unable to differentiate such different accents? Whether this is an oversight or intended for comedic effect isn't too clear.

558506,5,6303049079,"Now there are some serious fans of Robin Williams that will give some biased answers but I will look at the good and the bad both.

First this film was not to seem extremely realistic but funny with good morales being taught. The plot is about divorce and how children cope through an event. Now as a film for entertainment it is very good because of the comedic side (that's if you like comedy). As a film just to waste time on and do nothing it's not the film for you because there is lots of morale taught here and role modeling. As a film to help children I would say it is very good for Child psychology because Divorce for children is very difficult for them to understand and this film is good role modeling about the feelings children have.

Let's look at the Pro's and Con's

Pro's (Goods)

1. It is a movie with lots of good morales taught.

2. Is movie that raises hope for children

3. Comedy is done very well with much satire on the old idea of cross dressing.

4. The Actors are very good and experienced so their skill is brought into the film

Con's (Bad)

1. There are a few slip ups on the camera but if you haven't watched it time and time again you won't notice it.

2. Somewhat demonizes the female or single mother. But this depends on point of view. Single mothers are just as good as single fathers

Now this depends on your own personal point of view. Overall if you want a good comedy with some emotions and morals thrown in then this is a very fullfilling movie. If you want only comedy and no meaning and no lessons to be learned then this may not satisfy you.

Personally this is a very good comedy and would be considered a family movie. I give it 5 stars but again this depends on what you want.",1141689600,8,1727,4.21580547112462

558510,4,6303049079,"This was one of my favourite movies as a kid, and I still enjoy it to this day. I recently managed to get it on DVD, and was actually shocked when I turned it over, and discovered it had extras! Wow! And half-decent ones too. This is also one of my favourite Robin Williams movies ever, he's excellent, and shows his wide range of voices during this. And the fact he's also half gorilla. Has no one ever told him to wax?! He got rid of his arm hair for One Hour Photo, but I dread to think where else he's got hair ... :)

It's got such an original storyline to it, but now it's been announced there's going to be a sequel, nearly 14 years after the original! And Bonnie Hunt has written it? It was actually announced on IMDB on 1st April this year, so we'll see :) I honestly cannot see any of the kids coming back, never mind Sally Field, but Robin Williams is pencilled in for it. All the kids have long since grown up and most of them haven't done that much, particularly the actress who played Lydia, and that precocious little brat, Mara Wilson. (Who looks exactly the same.) The son, Matthew Lawrence, has done a few things, but nothing to write home about, but has turned out quite cute.

Mrs Doubtfire is absolutely hilarious, and still makes me laugh years on from watching it on video - which I still actually own. Ugh. It's all the makeup tryouts and everything. And also, I never realised as a young kid that Uncle Frank & the other guy were a couple. How innocent. You'll laugh at the bit where Daniel drops his 'face' - which took 50 takes - and everything else about this film.

Robin Williams is well-known for his improvisation during scenes in this movie but it also got him into trouble! But it was all Christopher Columbus' fault for giving him a chance to do what he wanted to do. His improvisation can occasionally spark off numerous references to other works that prove to be legal headaches for movie studios. The scene where Daniel speaks with his wife and refers to her clothes as ""this lovely Dances With Wolves motif"", required legal clearance for the studio to put it in the film. Associate producer Paula DuPr Pesman later kept track of every reference Williams made while improvising. During the scene when Mrs. Sellner comes to inspect Daniel's apartment and Daniel/Mrs. Doubtfire is serving her tea, the icing on his/her face is melting off. This was not intentional. The heat from the set lights melted the icing on his face and Robin Williams improvised the bulk of that scene.

Much of the extras are your typical deleted scenes, and interviews, but with Robin starring, they're actually funny, and a joy to watch. The makeup tests were filmed, and end on a brilliant note, with Robin telling the cameraman that they ""shot the s**t out of that one"". And also the deleted scenes included some scenes which I reckon should have been kept in the movie. Some were hilarious! And there's 30 minutes of them too, but some are obviously very long - but the subplot with the next door neighbour has to be seen to be believed, and is hilarious.

This movie is a must-have for any fan of Robin's and is well-worth seeing, if, shock horror, you haven't seen it before. You won't regret it.",1127692800,5,3215,4.488888888888889

Field shows why she's won two Oscars as she avoids the cliches her character may have been trapped in by giving us an honest, somewhat tragic, portrayal of a woman who just can't live with her husband and the father of her three children.  But it is the talented Williams whose portrayal of both said husband and the seemingly perfect Mrs. Doubtfire who makes this movie such a joyous treat.  With superb makeup, it's hard to believe that it is Williams nestling under the layers of makeup.

Mrs Doubtfire was a real punch and seems to improve through the ages. Somehow this film was the funny side of Kramer vs Kramer. The solid performance made for Robin Williams to my mind has been his second best achievement after Fisher King to date.

Robin Williams is hilarious as the ex-husband looking for some way to spend more time with the kids.  The plot is far-reaching but, then, so is Robin Williams's humor; his presence gives us a better inclination to just sit back and enjoy rather than figure out how the heck anyone could expect us to believe this plot.

Williams get a removable makeover as a somewhat elderly English nanny.  The possibilities are numerous and Williams gives us a look at plenty of them.  Having willfully given up worrying about reality, we accept the fact that no one is any the wiser to just who is this Mrs. Doubtfire.  He/she becomes the responsible father figure the children never seemed to have had before.  There are antics with the social worker and the ex's new boy friend.  All the while we're laughing hard.

Unfortunately, the writer and director forgot that every movie must have a beginning, middle and ending.  Some might say that two out of three ain't bad but most of us are left wondering which organization sponsored the criptic social message that passes for a conclusion.  Some may appreciate the message that is delivered but it is in total opposition to the mood the movie had so successfully created up to that point.  This is the ending to a drama; not to a comedy and even the loudest appologists have to realize that some one decided to trash the ending to make a point.  Save it for another movie or lose it altogether.  I was seriously considering rating this movie a ""3"" because the ending was that bad.

558581,1,6303049079,"I hate when I expect to be entertained by a movie, and it turns into a propaganda piece.  While there's no argument that there are some sublimely funny moments in this movie, they weave their way through a plot who's message is:  divorce is okay, kids are resilient, and if Mom and Dad are happy, the kids will be, too.

Sally Fields plays a woman who chooses to divorce her husband (Robin Williams) because (1) hubby is immature and (2) wife is tired of always having to play the heavy.  Sounds like good grounds for destroying a family, huh?

Dad moves out of the house, is denied any custody of the children, instead with access to the children limited to a few hours of weekly visitation.  That becomes the catalyst for him to mature, hold down a steady job, and become a responsible parent.  Oh well, too late, his wife decided that she's happier having shed him from her life, and if the kids are a bit sullen and griefstruck, that's tough luck for them too, because Mom's got a new love interest and has moved on from Dad.  Dad also seems to be enjoying his new single status, lusting after women (to great comic effect while in drag), with his primary interest at reconcilliation rooted in getting back to his kids more than his wife.

The most repulsive moment comes at the end, when Williams has landed a new job hosting a kids' TV show, and he works in a little story for the kids about how it's okay if Mom and Dad don't live together...that doesn't mean they don't love you.  Yeah, I'm sure every young child whose life was shattered with the news that their parents are divorcing found comfort in the words ""but we both love you, it's not your fault, it's just that Mommy and Daddy will be happier by living separately.""  Yeah, sure, whatever.

I give this movie 1 star because I can't separate out the funny moments from the wretched happy-divorce propaganda.  It's like saying Hitler was a monster, but he did lovely watercolor paintings.

What woman in today's America would hire a caretaker for her children in, of all places, San Francisco, Freak Central of the entire nation, by placing a classified ad in the newspaper and trying her luck with anyone who would respond? That only makes the wacky answers that Robin Williams in the role of alienated father and unemployed actor Daniel Hilliard gives to the ad totally believable, but it certainly casts quite a few doubts on the sort of mother that Miranda Hilliard (Sally Field) must be in leaving her three children with people she obtains in such a fashion! Then once the rather pachydermal Euphegenia Doubtfire, who is Daniel Hilliard in drag, thanks to the cosmetic genius of gay brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), appears on her doorstep, without bothering to check out her background or references, she hires her on the basis of an initial conversation, not even detecting that this ""woman"" is the man she lived with for years in matrimony. Believable? Not on your life, but it makes for some great entertainment.

Robin Williams is his usual manic comic genius, but Sally Field provides an excellent foil to his excessive manner. Aside from these two, however, the action is limited to none. The three children, Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence), and Nattie (Mara Wilson), play inconsequential children's roles in the film. Pierce Brosnan, as Miranda's old flame, Stu Dunmeyer, who turns up to be the threat to the place Daniel once occupied in her life, plays Pierce Brosnan with nothing spectacular to offer; he is there largely as an object to be attacked. Harvey Fierstein's appearance at the start of the film gives the film its push in the direction that it is inevitably to take -- into the cross-dressing arena -- but after that, the theme is dropped and not resumed.

The film treats the topic of non-custodial parenting and joint parenting in a very kind way, far kinder than the reality that most non-custodial parents face in the real world, and the film ends very happily in a way that is charming and endearing. There is no mistaking that a person watching the film cannot help but come away with a good feeling -- everyone except a parent who has been so severely burned by family court that the parent has lost all rights. It is with that one caveat that I would recommend the movie to everyone without hesitation, as I am also a parent who has faced the horrors of family court and know how brutal it can be. As my son said to me as the divorce proceedings moved forward, ""Face it, Daddy, this isn't going to be like Mrs. Doubtfire."" It certainly wasn't, but with time, my children stood up to their mother and to the court as well. For quite some time after my case had taken all my rights from me, I couldn't bear to watch this film because the pain was so severe that watching it brought tears -- bitter tears -- to my eyes. When a person watches Robin Williams and cries, something is VERY wrong.

Even with these caveats, there is much to enjoy in this film, and those who watch it will surely find much that they will cherish.",1110585600,3,3193,4.647787610619469

558624,3,6303049079,"Somewhere during the mid 1990s, Mrs Doubtfire moved from being a very funny film to being a decent enough way to wile away a couple of hours. Therein lies the big problem with this film. There is no doubt that it is a good comedy, but it simply is not a film that you can watch repeatedly, as it definitely loses its impact if you watch it too often. I really got fed up with this film sometime around 1995 as I had seen it too often (cinema, television, video). I have not watched the film since, until I sat down and watched this DVD for the review. Returning to it after a break of six years certainly has freshened up the comedy a little and it has turned out to be something of a pleasant experience to do this review. I guess now that I should resist the temptation to watch the DVD again until maybe 2006.

Funnily enough I was reminded of this problem with the film by my brother when it was announced that I had the DVD for review: ""Not a film you can watch too often"" he said, and reminded me of the fact that I had not seen it for a while.

That is not to say that it is a bad film, but simply that it is a film that outstays its welcome very quickly in my view. The story is a pretty simple one. Manic but loving father of three and sometime actor Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) has a knack for annoying his busy professional wife Miranda (Sally Field). This is no more evidenced than when he collects his children from school on his son's twelfth birthday and takes them home for a birthday party - a party specifically forbidden by dear old mother - complete with a mobile zoo. Cue one nosey neighbour who drops poor old Daniel in it by telephoning Miranda. Cue the obligatory mid-life marital bust-up and the dreaded D-word. Daniel finds himself in court with a judge passing sentence on him - 90 days to prove he is worthy of joint custody of his children or else: in the interim, Saturday-only visits. Faced with limited options, he gets himself an apartment, gets a job and sets out to impress his case worker. Then, he finds out that Miranda is planning to employ a housekeeper to look after the children and house during the afternoon and evening until Miranda returns from work.

Desperate for more time with his children, Daniel makes the natural choice of gaining the job, which he does by slightly devious means. Thus is born Mrs Doubtfire, the almost perfect housekeeper who miraculously gets everything working almost to perfection, although watching wealthy Stu Dunmire (Pierce Brosnan) muscling in on his ex-wife and children sometimes gets a little too much. The merriment continues as ""she"" gets the opportunity of a new career at the television station where he works.

Just as Tootsie depended entirely on Dustin Hoffman carrying off the role of the cross-dresser, so Mrs Doubtfire depends pretty much entirely upon Robin Williams carrying off the role of the cross-dresser. Since Robin Williams is an extremely talented actor, even if perhaps not so talented chooser of roles, there was little doubt that he had the ability to carry off the role. However, the film was to a large extent made by the performance of Sally Field playing off Robin Williams, and some of their scenes together are about as good as you can see in comedy. Pretty much the rest of the cast were along for the ride, and it would appear to have been a rather enjoyable ride, with only Harvey Fierstein being completely memorable. The direction of Chris Columbus is pretty taut and this generally is a very decent effort across the board.

Certainly a film to be enjoyed, just not every other day in my view. There might be better around but this is still worthy of consideration.",1104364800,4,3686,4.528528528528528

558627,5,6303049079,"Mrs. Doubtfire is a comical film following the life of an actor, named Daniel, played by

Robin Williams.  The audience enjoys in watching Daniel's quite amusing attempts at

getting his life back in order after loosing both his job and his marriage in the same day.

Excellently directed, Mrs. Doubtfire is the perfect combination of both humor and

heartache.  Dealing with issues of a broken home, the movie allows many Americans to

relate to the lives of the characters.

The viewer watches as a father is torn away from his kids, whom he loves dearly.  One can

not help but feel compassion for him as he struggles to find a way back into his children's

lives.  Viewers will feel like they really know Daniel after watching him grow as both a

person and a father.

In desperation, Daniel takes on another identity in effort to spend more time with his

beloved children.  One's stomach will split with laughter watching  him jump from one

identity to the other in attempt to remain unidentified.  The humor involved is clean, yet

hilarious.  Something both kids and their parents can enjoy together.

Mrs. Doubtfire will grip one's heart and hold on tight, until the very end when tears of joy

will slowly well up in every eye.  A perfect film for the whole family, Mrs. Doubtfire is

definitely worth one's time.",1101686400,22,1324,4.726872246696035
558628,5,6303049079,"A first-rate cast and an innovative script helped make 1993's ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" a big movie hit. Robin Williams, Sally Field, and Pierce Brosnan display their individual and collective acting talents in ""Doubtfire"". I enjoyed each of their performances here. Brosnan's quiet, understated, and laid-back portrayal of ""the other man"" in Sally's life might often get overlooked in this film, but I think Brosnan's character plays very nicely against that of Mrs. Doubtfire.

But this film, of course, 'belongs' to Robin Williams. It's a veritable tour-de-force for Robin here, as he manages to juggle two different roles, seemingly with ease. A remarkable ""two-for-the-price-of-one"" performance. He literally ""becomes"" Mrs. Doubtfire when he dons that wardrobe and make-up.

And Sally Field, as always, is outstanding here. In a way, she has the rather thankless job of playing opposite the human twin-tornado (Robin) in this film. But Sally is able to shine through in her own right, in my view. She's always a treat to watch on the screen. And ""Doubtfire"" is no exception.

Sally went from co-starring in one blockbuster movie to yet another -- after wrapping up ""Doubtfire"", she next played Tom Hanks' mom in 1994's mega-hit (and ""Best Picture"" Oscar-winner), ""Forrest Gump"".

The ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" DVD brims over with special stuff. There are more than 30 minutes of ""Deleted Scenes"" on the disc, scenes that Director Chris Columbus was pretty much forced to cut out of the movie due to time constraints. Kind of a shame too, because nearly all of these deleted scenes are very good, and would not have been a detriment to the film at all, IMO.

""Doubtfire"" co-star Polly Holliday, no doubt, is one person who wishes a few of these tossed-out scenes had made it into the final cut of the movie. Because nearly all of Polly's work was left on the cutting room floor it seems. But, at least, these clips ARE available in some fashion -- as an extra bonus on this DVD.

I've found myself watching the ""Deleted Scenes"" area of this disc as much as the film itself. Polly Holliday is an absolute riot in many of these scenes, as she interacts with ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". Polly soon finds out that Mrs. Doubtfire's ""secret"" concoction for keeping her garden looking like a showplace is not exactly the best thing for her plants.  LOL!

The DVD also contains interviews with the cast, Makeup Tests, Storyboards, Trailers, TV Ads, and more.

Video looks quite good here, even though this 1999-produced DVD has not been enhanced for widescreen televisions. But the 2.35:1 non-anamorphic Widescreen picture still looks fairly sharp and clear, with good colors.

There's a Dolby Digital 5.0 Surround soundtrack on the disc; along with a 2.0 DD Surround track. There's also audio in French 2.0 Surround. Plus a Commentary Track by Director Chris Columbus.

558629,5,6303049079,"Robin Williams and Sally Field star as Daniel and Miranda Hillard who start out as a happily married couple, but one day Miranda wakes up and realizes that she is tired of being the only adult in the family, especially after Daniel decided to turn the house into a circus.

So, they get a divorce, but unfortunately for Daniel, he hardly gets to see the kids, who definitely miss him.  Miranda needs to hire some help to watch the kids in the afternoon.  Since Daniel is an actor, he decides to respond to Miranda's ad in the newspaper.  Of course, he goes through several different characters before he becomes Mrs. Eugenia Doubtfire.

By being Mrs. Doubtfire, Daniel is able to see his kids all of the time.  The funny thing is that when he becomes Mrs. Doubtfire, he actually becomes a better parent.  He makes sure that the kids do their homework before anything else.  He sets more limits for the kids as Mrs. Doubtfire than he ever would have as Daniel.

Robin Williams is excellent as Daniel, and Sally Field shines as Miranda.  All of the kids are really good as well.  Pierce Brosnan does a good job as Miranda's future love interest as well as Daniel's nemesis.

Chris Columbus does an excellent job in directing the cast to show a rather positive view of handling a divorce.  Is this situation plausible in real life?  Probably not, but it is nice to see a positive outlook of different families, and the fact that it is all about showing love to your children and making them feel loved and secure.  Because as Mrs. Doubtfire says, sometimes it is better for parents to be away from each other than to constantly fight.

If you want to see Robin Williams doing what he does best, then you will enjoy watching him as Daniel, a father who will go to any lengths to be a part of his kids' lives.",1099785600,12,1804,4.470948012232416

When he starred in ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" in 1993, I became an even bigger fan of his. He has always been histerically funny, but he displays his comical talents in a full performance here.

  Daniel Hillard (played by Robin Williams) is an actor, who has worked several jobs, but has never been able to maintain one for a long period of time. His current profession is lending his voice talents doing the voices of kids' cartoons. After quitting that job, he sets out to pick up his three kids from school. Among his three kids are: Lydia (Lisa Jakob), Chris (played by Matthew Lawrence), & Natalie (played by Maura Wilson). When they return home, Daniel gives Chris the best birthday party ever, until Daniel's wife, Miranda Hillard (played by Sally Field), who is also the mother of Daniel's children, comes home early. Miranda is so sick of Daniel and his games, where she finds herself not loving Daniel anymore, forcing her to file for a divorce. The kids are devastated, for they adore their father, as he does them. Miranda is granted sole custody of their children, but Daniel is allowed visitation rights. This should cheer Daniel up, for he is allowed the chance to see his children, but he can only see them on Saturdays.

  After learning that Miranda is placing a newspaper add for a housekeeper, Daniel makes a few calls to Miranda, speaking in different women voices. He is after the job to see his kids more often. He calls one final time, using the voice of a sweet 60-year-old British nanny. He introduces himself over the phone as Mrs. Doubtfire. Miranda arranges a meeting with the supposed Mrs. Doubtfire for the following Monday night. Daniel goes off to his brother, Frank, who is, number one: gay, and number two: a fantastic make-up artist. Frank provides Daniel with just the right wig, the right outfits, the right glasses, and the right facial mask that will force Miranda to never suspect anything is up.

  Daniel heads over to his old house and goes along with the meeting, where he officially introduces himself as Mrs. Euphegina Doubtfire. Miranda introduces her to the kids. Natalie and Chris take a liking to Mrs. Doubtfire, but Lydia is not impressed. Miranda officially hands Mrs. Doubtfire the job and away we go. Daniel seems to be handling everything fine: working as a shipping clerk by day and then working as a British nanny in drag by night. Lydia finally warms up to Mrs. Doubtfire. The family seems to be getting along just fine, until Daniel learns of Miranda dating her old high school boyfriend, Stuart Dunmeyer (played by the conceited Pierce Brosnan). After meeting Stuart for the first time, Daniel goes about the day as Mrs. Doubtfire, where he tends to giving Lydia an oral spelling test, helping her for school. It is not, until Daniel heads into the bathroom to make a house call, where Chris comes in and finds the secret, well, sort of. Thinking Mrs. Doubtfire is both sort of man and woman, they soon discover that Mrs. Doubtfire is not Mrs. Doubtfire, but their father in drag. Chris and Lydia are more than happy to see their father their and they swear to keep it a secret for him.

  Miranda's birthday is just one day away and Miranda has invited Mrs. Doubtfire to join Miranda, Stu, and the kids for a dinner on the night of Miranda's birthday, where they'll be having dinner at Miranda's favorite restaurant, Bridges. Mrs. Doubtfire tries to back out, but Natalie convinces Mrs. Doubtfire to join them. Mrs. Doubtfire makes the promise of joining them. It turns out that Daniel tried to back out of it because on the same night of Miranda's birthday, he is having a meeting with T.V. executive, Mr. Jonathan Lundy (played by Robert Prosky). Mr. Lundy is interested in Daniel's ideas of a new television daytime show for kids. It turns out that Mr. Lundy has set up a meeting between him and Daniel on the same night as Miranda's birthday, and the meeting will be held at...Bridges Restaurant. Daniel decides to be there for both occasions. He sits with the family and Stu as Mrs. Doubtfire and then heads to make a call to the front desk, asking them to send a message of his late arrival for his meeting with Mr. Lundy. He sits back down with the family, as Miranda takes Natalie on a house call. He then has Lydia and Chris head over to the dessert tray, where he sits alone with Stu. He begins throwing Stu sexual innuendos, but heads off to the bathroom, where changes out of the Mrs. D. outfit and then dresses in a suit and tie, where he heads out to join Mr. Lundy. He does this for the next several occasions, until he comes back to the family as Mrs. D and orders his dinner. Overhearing that Stu requests that there be no pepper in his, Daniel, still dressed as Mrs. D. runs off to change again and sit back down with Mr. Lundy. He gets up not even five minutes later and is back in the Mrs. D. outfit. He walks into the kitchen and secretly and cold-heartedly puts red pepper in Stu's dinner. He comes back out and sits down with Mr. Lundy. But Daniel does not realize is that he is dressed up as Mrs. Doubtfire. He convinces Mr. Lundy that Mrs. Doubtfire is the perfect host for a completely different kids show that'll have the kids immediate attention. That is when Stu begins to choke on his pepper filled dinner. Daniel runs over to Stu, still dressed as Mrs. Doubtfire and gives Stu the heimlick manuever. Stu falls backward and lands ontop of Daniel, coughing up a piece of his dinner. Daniel gets up and realizes that his facial mask, has slipped off of his eyes, causing Miranda to be enraged.

  Back in court, Miranda is granted to maintain her full custody of their children, while Daniel is still granted his one Saturday a week of visitation rights, but the judge has ordered the visits to be supervised. Daniel tries to convince the judge of how much he adores his children, but the judge does not give in. Daniel moves on, with being the new host of a new kids show, but he hosts the show as Mrs. Doubtfire. Miranda and the kids watch everyday, until Miranda heads down to the studio after Daniel finishes up another day's episode. He notices Miranda and looks at her coldfully and hurtful. He goes to get changed as she waits for him. Miranda reveals how much she and the kids miss Mrs. Doubtfire.

  The next afternoon, while watching their father's show, Miranda tells the kids to stand by the front door, for she has found a new babysitter. The new babysitter is...Daniel. He and Miranda have worked out an agreement with the courts, where everyday after school, Daniel will have the kids stay with him at his appartment for a few hours, as Miranda works her long hours. She also reveals that the supervision is done. The visits between father and kids are only between father and kids. The kids run up to get their stuff as Daniel waits outside, where Miranda watches the rest of the day's episode, where Mrs. Doubtfire is reading a letter from a little girl, whose parents had just gotten a divorce. She watches the last of the episode, feeling bad for hurting Daniel the way she did and thinking that she made a mistake in filing for the divorce. As she watches the last bit, the kids run out to their father, where they hug him so passionately and drive off to his appartment.

I had been working with divorced and single fathers for a few years by the time the movie came out and had just released a comprehensive education manual to be distributed by non-profit groups for fathers.

That's why I feel that when someone like me praises a movie of his, it should mean a lot more. Watching Mrs. Doubtfire, I was forced to admire his sheer guts in tackling this Tootsie role (sans roll) despite the huge success Dustin Hoffman already had with it.
Most of Robin's film parts amount to a large junkpile of bad remakes, half-written plots and other ""at least it's a fat paycheck"" duds. It is also mind boggling how he got an Oscar for his minor foul-mouthed cameo in Good Will Hunting. However, every once in a long while he incredibly rises far above his journeyman talents and rightfully dons the mantle of a true master of the art.
(Not that co-star Sally Field was just using up air here, either - she was a great anchor of reality for the film. Which is not an easy task to perform for someone as cute and bubbly as she normally is.)
Robin's actually done five other proper acting jobs, which round out an even half dozen when added to Doubtfire. And these few other fine movies are, not surprisingly, parts where he really doesn't play himself: Good Morning Vietnam, Hook, Jumangi, Dead Poets Society and Cadillac Man.
Well, most actors when their careers are over should consider themselves lucky to even end up with a trilogy of film classics in the can, after doing the usual 25 to 50 major works. But right now Robin's got those six gems, and he still has time to complete a crown of an even dozen.

It's the story of divorce, and mom has custody and prevents dad (Williams) from seeing the kids. So he dresses as a British nanny and is hired to care for them. Beautifully acted by everyone.

558752,5,6303049079,"In 1993, Chris Columbus directed Mrs. Doubtfire, one of the funniest films of the 1990's. It has since become one of my favourite films ever, and never fails to make me laugh every time I watch it. The film became a massive worldwide Box Office success at Christmas and made Robin Williams an even bigger international superstar. The film is very popular amongst the public, but critics often have a hard time giving it any praise at all, because of the acting. Even I admit that the acting in Mrs. Doubtfire is not excellent, but if you can get past that and focus on the jokes and the storyline, then you're onto a real winner.

Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is happily married to his lovely wife Miranda (Sally Field). Together, they have three children. Their only son is Chris (Matthew Lawrence). With him, they have two daughters. The youngest is Natalie (Mara Wilson) and the oldest is Lydia (Lisa Jakub). Miranda is a highly successful designer, and she is the one who runs the household, pays the bills and manages to live in such a massive house. Daniel is constantly between jobs, voicing cartoon characters on kids' television shows. Because of this, he gets to spend much more time with his children than Miranda does. To Daniel, life couldn't be better, but for Miranda life is hell. She constantly works and gets to spend no time with her children. The film begins (after a short introduction) one day when it is Chris' birthday. His mum says they cannot have a party, but Daniel disobeys these rules by going ahead and throwing a street party (complete with Petting Zoo!) while Miranda's at work. She returns home after a tip off from the next door neighbour totally disgusted, later telling Daniel that she wants a divorce. He is heartbroken, as are the kids. Three months later at their divorce, Daniel loses custody of his children to Miranda. He is desperate to be with his children, and no special visitation rights are good enough. So, along with his gay brother (and his partner), they hatch a disguise for Daniel. After many hours of treatment and disguises, Mrs. Doubtfire is finally born...

Daniel catches the advertisement from Miranda for a housekeeper, and rings up to inquire for the job in many awful personas that make Miranda think twice, but then Mrs. Doubtfire inquires. Fooled by Daniel's disguise, Miranda instantly hires Mrs. Doubtfire after one interview. No one knows that Mrs. Doubtfire is indeed Daniel in disguise. His children feel so far away from their father, but he's right with them at all times - well, 3:00pm until 7:00pm. In his real world, Daniel must also get a job and a place of his own and report to a social worker, Mrs. Sellner (Anne Haney). After her divorce, Miranda begins seeing her co-worker, Stu (Pierce Brosnan).

Mrs. Doubtfire contains so many excellent scenes and jokes that it's impossible to fit them all in one review. The scene where Daniel is voicing a bird for a cartoon is hilarious. Chris' birthday party is wonderful, and Daniel's impressions as he applies for a job are hysterical, too. There is also a great part where Aerosmith's ""Dude Looks Like A Lady"" plays in the background as Mrs. Doubtfire goes about her daily arrangements. Playing football with the kids, getting on a bus to an old driver who fancies 'her' and learning how to cook are the highlights. Daniel has to learn how to cook, after his first experience of doing so. The scene is a 'Oh-my-God-this-is-so-funny-I-can't-breathe' type scene! His facial expressions are priceless as Mrs. Doubtfire sets fire to her fake boobs. She screams her head off racing around the kitchen trying desperately to put the fire out with spatulas and pan lids! There's also an excellent scene where Mrs. Sellner visits Daniel to see how he's coping. She catches him in his Mrs. Doubtfire disguise, so he has to constantly change clothes and his voice to keep her fooled - and as if this wasn't funny enough, the scenes where he's making Mrs. Sellner's cup of tea are downright classic. ""Oh, your tea!"" he screams in his voice to fool the woman as she approaches the kitchen to see what's the matter with him. He has no choice but to stuff his face into cake icing to disguise himself after he looses his mask! It really is hilarious stuff. The swimming pool scenes are also excellent, where Stu asks Mrs. Doubtfire to join him and the family in the pool. ""Oh! You wicked, wicked monkey!"" she exclaims. So she sits by the side of the pool watching Stu take over Daniel's family!

The film ends on Miranda's birthday where all the family, Mrs. Doubtfire and Stu are invited to Bridges restaurant for a posh meal. Unfortunately, Daniel has a business meeting with a boss at a television company where he works part-time at the same restaurant. Cue many clothes-changing moments as Mrs. Doubtfire and Daniel swop seating arrangements so they can please everyone. The film then goes onto a huge revelation (obviously that Miranda discovers Mrs. Doubtfire is Daniel in disguise) and then the film finally ends on a positive note with a clear message about divorcing families and that things aren't always as bad as they seem. Overall, an excellent comedy. Highly recommended to people of all ages.",1055894400,7,5222,4.786031042128603
558753,5,6303049079,"In 1993, Chris Columbus directed one of the funniest films that Robin Williams has ever starred in: ""Mrs. Doubtfire"".  Based upon the novel ""Alias Madame Doubtfire"" written by Anne Fine, Robin Williams plays the role of Daniel Hillard, a frequently unemployed actor who specializes in voice impersonations.  He and his wife Miranda (Sally Field) have three children: Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence) and Natalie (Mara Wilson).  With Miranda working as a highly successful designer, Daniel spends more time with the children than she can. After Miranda comes home to find her home in total disarray with an uproarious birthday party for Chris that includes petting-zoo animals, she completely loses her temper and tells Daniel that she wants a divorce.  Daniel is dumbstruck and eventually loses custody of the children to Miranda in court, but wants desperately to spend more time with them than his visitation privileges allow.  Upon learning that Miranda plans to hire a nanny to stay with the children when she's at work, Daniel decides to present himself as a potential nanny to Miranda.  With the aid of his brother Frank (Harvey Fierstein), who is a makeup artist, and his brother's partner Jack (Scott Capurro), Daniel is transformed into a kindly old woman that he names Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire.  Fooled by Daniel's disguise, Miranda hires Mrs. Doubtfire.  The story heats up even more when Miranda is courted by an old friend, Stuart 'Stu' Dunmeyer (Pierce Brosnan).
The acting in the film, especially Sally Field and Robin Williams, is superb and the story is completely engaging.  Memorable scenes in the film include Chris' birthday party, Daniel's first interview with the social worker Mrs. Sellner (Anne Haney), Daniel getting a regular job, Daniel's various impersonations over the telephone, Frank & Jack testing various disguises on Daniel, Mrs. Doubtfire cooking her first dinner, Mrs. Sellner's visit to Daniel's apartment, the country club, and the restaurant.  Other very memorable characters in the film include Jonathan Lundy (Robert Prosky), the bus driver (Sydney Walker), Mr. Sprinkles (William Newman), and Daniel's boss at the TV station (Joe Bellan).
If you enjoy films such as ""Tootsie"" (1982) and ""Some Like It Hot"" (1959), you're sure to enjoy ""Mrs. Doubtfire"".  Overall, I rate ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a funny and engaging comedy.",1054252800,44,2446,5.2301790281329925

558756,5,6303049079,"Although I myself was never a big fan of Mr. Williams, after seeing Mrs. Doubtfire, I changed my mind.

Williams plays Daniel, an actor who is recently unemployed, and a husband and father about to lose his family after pushing his uptight wife Miranda (Sally Field) over the edge.  She has been feeling unhappy for a long time with Daniel, but after a wild childrens Birthday party for his son, replete with barnyard animals in the living room, Miranda calls it quits.  Daniel is lost without his family, so he enlists the expertise of his brother to make him into a woman.  When Miranda interviews for a new housekeeper, there is Daniel as Mrs. Doubtfire at the door.

 This is a wonderful movie for the whole family to enjoy.  Williams is touching as the father who longs for the precious time he can spend with his three beloved children, even if he has to do it in DRAG!  Sally Field is a bit irritating in her intolerance of Daniel at first, but then sweetens to the realization that he is a very special dad who will sacrifice whatever he has to, to get what he wants.

There are many fun comic moments where Williams gets caught between his gender bending dual act, and of course his knack for voices is also showcased here as well.  All in all, a definite treat that you AND your children can enjoy together.",1047254400,10,1317,4.472803347280335

Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) applies for the job disguised as a brittish Nanny with a brittish accent.  My favorite part was when Chris Hillard (Matthew Lawrence) walks into the bathroom and finds Mrs. Doutfire using the toilet.  All in all this is one of my very favorite movies.

Mrs. Doubtfire is about a man who gets divorced but really loves his kids, and goes to extremes to be with them. What does he doe? He pretends to be a maid by dressing up as an old lady. Robin does a great job of playing Mrs. Doubtfire, and changing roles.
I loved this movie. Robin Williams does a great job at playing two people. It's really amazing how he can switch voices (everything from Gandi to a Mafia thug to an old lady, Mrs. Doubtfire). It's really a hilarious movie, and although it's a little old, it's a classic. It was so funny and is suitable for both kids and adults. It's a little bit suggestive in some places (but usually the language is advanced too).

If you have watched Mrs. Doutbfire and wished to have seen more of Polly Hoilday, then I reccomend you to watch the deleted scenes because there are about 4 or 5 scenes (deleted from the movie) with Polly in them. Mrs. Doubtfire is the story of an actor named Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) who has quit in the middle of voicing characters for a cartoon starting a bird and a cat. He gets home in time to meet his 3 kids, Lydia (Lisa Jakub), Chris (Matthew Lawrence and Natalie (Mara Wilson). He throws Chris a party, but when a complaint comes to his wife Miranda Hillard (Sally Field) from a neighbor (Polly Holliday), Miranda comes home early to find her house a zoo. And catches her husband acting like a kid so she ends the birthday party and starts to clean up and gets in a fight with Daniel and decides to get a dirvoce. Daniel loses custody of the three kids and ends up ordered that he cna only see them every Saturday.
Besides the deleted scenes on the dvd, you also have Commentary by Chris Columbus, On Screen interviews with Robin Willaims, Pierce Brosnan, Harvey Fierstein and Chris Columbus. Animation penical tests and more. My Thoughts on the film. This is a great movie to watch if you are either going to become a father (for the first time), going to get married and learn how to be both a good father and husband and not having your marriage ending in a dirovce. The actors and actress give a good performance. But also please remember this movie is rated PG-13 for lanuage and I'm not sure if has that rating for anything else. But if you love to watch movies on dvd with delted scenes or outakes, I also reccomend you to to watch this for that reason. So please to yourself a favor a buy this movie (if you don't own it). But if you have not seen the movie please rent it first to see if you will like this movie. And if you are a fan of ""letterbox"" format, there is a widescreen edition of this film. This is a film I would reccomend to fans of Robin Williams, who really hates the idea of only seeing his kids every Saturday.

Someone who'll make them do their homework, eat dinner, be in bed on time, etc. Meanwhile, the father-who is desperate to see his kids everyday-disguises himself as a woman and is hired as the kids' nanny.

558898,5,6303049079,"""Mrs. Doubtfire"" shows how a father that recently got a divorce, Daniel Hillard, took on a major role to be able to spend quality time with his children. This film shows how good people will put their reputation at stake for the love of others. This is one of the most feel good movies that teaches outstanding morals and is ideal for children and children, but particularly children. When Daniel Hillard gets a divorce from Miranda Hillard, Daniel only gets to see his three children once a week under the supervision of a proffesional hired by the court. Daniel decides that he won't put up with the unfair treatment and he has a plan. Miranda needs to hire a babysitter, and Daniel gets the job. He takes on an alias of Mrs. Doubtfire, a British nanny. This is the start to this family comedy.
 There are many lessons to be learned from this film. One message to be learned is that you should always put the good out in the sake of others to a certain extent. Daniel Hillard went to the extremes so he could spend time with his family. This film also shows how a judge, who knows nothing about the family and the life that the Hillard family had at home, makes a ruling that will change the people of the family's lives forever. This should teach people that our court system doesn't always do the right things. This film is a great family movie that is very funny and has good morals. This movie is not to be missed.

558899,5,6303049079,"This quiet and unassuming movie stormed movie theaters back in the winter of 1993. I don't think anybody had any idea that it would explode into the behemoth smash that it became. It was well deserved. Director Chris Columbus(Home Alone, Harry Potter) directed this charming tale which stars Robin Williams. Robin plays Daniel Hillard, a man who specializes in voice over work for cartoons. He has a wife and three kids. Daniel's world comes crashing down when his wife Miranda(Sally Field)announces that she wants a divorce. Daniel packs his things and moves out of their nice San Francisco home. Daniel is so depressed that he can't see his kids as often anymore, so he sets out to change that. He goes to his make up artist brother(played by Harvey Fierstein)and creates the disguise of an elderly british woman named Mrs. Doubtfire. He applies for the nanny job his wife is hiring for and gets it. From then on, it's madcap situations as Daniel tries to be a part of his family again and to keep his identity a secret from everyone. Williams is a master. What can I say?. They broke the mold when they made him. This is one of his most impressive performances. Ranging from slapstick goofy to seriously emotional drama. Sally Field, while good, seems to have nothing to do but to look sad. Doesn't it look like her mouth is shaped in the form of a frown?. The supporting cast includes Pierce Brosnan, Robert Prosky, and an uncredited cameo by Martin Mull. The movie, while hilariously funny, also shows how hard and emotional a break up and eventual divorce can be on a family. Even tho it is surrounded by funny stuff, it's a subject matter not to be taken lightly. Everyone here pulled it off and did a magnificent job. Mrs. Doubtfire is a movie to enjoy over and over again.",1018051200,5,1781,4.639240506329114
558900,5,6303049079,"If you want a funny movie with a good blend of human emotions and sensitivity, ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" is the one. It is just hysterical, and an excellent film. Robin Williams portrays Daniel Hillard, a laid-back father who is absolutely crazy about his three children, who love him just as much. When Daniel's behavior becomes more than his wife Miranda (Sally Field) can handle, she files a divorce. Daniel is devastated at the loss of his wife, but more than that, he cannot stand to be separated from his children. He is willing to make as many sacrifices as he needs in order to be with them, even if it means putting on a dress, a bodysuit and a little makeup and portraying a devoted old nanny whom Miranda instantly hires to help take care of the kids. In the process, Daniel works hard to shape up his own life and ultimately mature as a parent. You will laugh hysterically at Daniel's attempts as ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" and you will be touched at the special pains he goes to just to see his children every day. Of course, it's not just Robin Williams who supplies the entertainment in this movie. Mara Wilson, who plays Daniel's youngest daughter Nattie, will have you rolling on the floor laughing. With that sweet little lisp and the innocence of a 5-year-old, she almost stole the show (in my opinion). There is a very good cast here, and this movie has everything. Humor, tears, sensitivity....you name it. Do yourself a favor and watch this one. If you haven't seen it yet, now is the time. It's the kind of film that you can watch over and over and laugh just as often every time, if not more.
