6412916,5,B00KB3PZCE,"I'm so happy that these FINALLY got released.  Admittedly, they aren't exactly ""high quality"" (in fact I'd say they are on par with VHS quality video wise), there are no sub-titles and no original Japanese audio, and the censoring done on a few of the episodes is still present...  But in all honesty, I'D RATHER HAVE THESE THAN NOTHING!!!  I bought all three seasons at once and the only gripe I have is that a couple of the disks (across all three sets... and I mean like 2 or 3) had some bad spots where one of the episodes on the disk would glitch for a little bit, but two of them my computer managed to play through though the video was a little garbled, and the third one I think I lost like 5-10 seconds of audio and video.  But other wise they all worked and worked well.

What probably makes me happier than anything is that when I remember these being broadcast on TV as a kid the station that was carrying this series must have skipped a few of the episodes in the second season because there are a few I didn't recognize.  Also the last episode they aired was the episode with Jill on the mountain side and they never showed the ending episodes!  And on top of that, despite the fact that the first season was run two or three times, what little of the second season they aired only aired once and was never shown again.

SOOOOOOO happy to finally see the end of this series!!!",1419206400,,1390,4.278625954198473
6412917,5,B00KB3PZCE,"The second season of Monster Rancher is even better than the first, as it closes in a dramatic, appropriate way for the show. (In fact, Season 2 was the finale to the entire series until Season 3 was made a year later!) Everything had been building up to this point, and while the third season is good, the second season closes on a more powerful, personal note than that one does.  I cried when i first saw it, and sometimes I still do when i think about it! But that's part of what made Monster Rancher so special--the personal connection is there, just like in the games.",1415836800,4,574,4.364485981308412

6412920,5,B00KB3PZCE,"Kudos to Discotek Media / Eastern Star for getting Monster Rancher season 2 and 3 out to the fans!!  We have been waiting many years to watch these episodes in DVD quality.  Easily my favorite anime to date, so I am eagerly awaiting the DVDs.  Many people will compare this show to Pokemon.. but outside of having monsters and humans working together and fighting enemies, this show is nothing like Pokemon.  In fact, it is a little more gritty and dark... and the leads (Genki and Holly) are nowhere near as annoying as Ash and Misty.  :)

I will try to remember to add more to the review once I have actually watched the episodes and can review the quality.",1406592000,4,659,4.45

8657213,5,B00KB3PZCE,"This was such a cool cartoon as a kid. Back than, we loved monsters, well, the kind of monsters from the cartoon that is. I loved everything from this cartoon Monster Rancher, it had action, adventure, drama, comedy and cool characters in this. They had all sorts of adventures that were so cool, so many cool monsters. This is a piece of cartoon history gold here. I'd recommend this cartoon to any kids who love monsters in their own little world.",1455235200,,449,4.555555555555555

8657215,5,B00KB3PZCE,"Glad to have received season 2 of Monster Rancher on DVD, and the delivery and processing were timely and came well within expected time frame. Glad to say that it has more of the same exquisitely done video, audio, and editing (as in editing between ""acts"" or where the commercials used to be when broadcast) as season 1. Eastern Star has set an admirable bar to getting this great ""mon"" series onto DVD, and I'll expect to see more of it in the third and final season (season 3 is all I need now). Thanks again!",1431216000,,513,4.354166666666667
