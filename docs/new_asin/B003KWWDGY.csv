Brilliant music that is expected from Delerium this is no different. Their live performance exceeds any recording in any album and just about all of the songs done here are better sounding. In using live instruments Drums, Guitar Base, keyboards in a live concert gives them a cut above over their musical counterparts in the same genre such as Engima.

Kristy Thirsk and her sexy good looks and moves along with her powerful and beautiful voice add to this performance in this DVD. Lea Nash the same. All of the songs here are excellent, favorites are ""Self Saboteur"", ""Terra Firma"", ""Twilight"", ""Forgotten Worlds"", ""Incantation"" and there are others. The only song that wasn't up to par as the original was ""after all"". Though Kristy did a fantastic job here I felt Jael was a little better. Still I gave this DVD from Delerium five stars and I'm usually a critic and hard to give five stars to anything. This one deserves it. The ambience, the beat, give it try you'll be hooked.",1286409600,14,1096,4.829787234042553

8399019,3,B003KWWDGY,"I was there that night at the 9:30 Club in DC. It was a great show; certainly one of my fondest concert memories. Leigh Nash and Kristy Thirsk did a great job tackling a strong set of Delerium material. While the audio mix on the DVD is a little different than it was the night of the show (the live mix was a little more bass heavy), the DVD does a great job capturing the powerful performance put on that night. Or at least the audio does.

Standing not too far out from Leigh Nash and the bassist, I had a great view of the show that night. But at times watching this DVD I hardly recognized the experience, and I don't mean that in a good way. That night I witnessed a very down to earth performance, with the performers really connecting with the audience. Yes, there was a video playing visuals in the background the whole show, but the performance wasn't about the visuals. It was about sharing great music.

Don't get me wrong, I appreciate art, and visual art. At times the visual effects on the video accent the songs. But most times they're just distracting, and I feel contrary the spirit of that show. Besides Kristy strutting around stage for pretty much the entire show (I remember that vividly), the other performers moved little and were very focused on the music. It wasn't showy, and it certainly wasn't a spectacle. It was all about the music, and the live venue. There are just too many times watching this video that the visual effects distract from that.

So my overall rating is five stars for the music. The audio on this DVD does a fantastic job capturing the performances put forth that night. But the visual effects are far too distracting at times, and don't truly capture what it was like to be there that night. So from a visual perspective I have to bring it down to three stars. The visual effects are just far too jarring, at times pointless, and inconsistent throughout.  Still, if you've never had a chance to see Delerium live, this does offer great audio of a fantastic show.

On a personal note though, I'm not sure why the DVD does not contain all of the songs performed that night. Delerium gave a great performance of ""Run For It"" that night with Leigh Nash rocking the vocals, but that song didn't make it onto the video here. I also remember the third singer featuring earlier in the show, and feel like there was a song from the encore that is also missing. Unfortunately after four years it's hard to remember exactly what the set list was, but I am positive that this isn't the complete set of songs from the show.",1350432000,,2561,4.452025586353945
8399020,3,B003KWWDGY,"The music was great and close to the actual concert I attended at BB Kings in New York City.  I do think they cut the actual show short compared to the NYC show. I remember a full size bass in one of them which wasn't seen in this video. I vaguely remember more songs, but while writing this I just can't remember them.

Here's where they lost 2-stars. What did drive me crazy was the distracting effects that Nasty Byte decided to throw in. If you can remember back when the first camcorders came out with those cheesy special effects? You're going to see every one of them numerous times to the point where it gets annoying and distracting. It could have been cut much better too. I've seen bad wedding videos where the work was more professional than in this product. I guess we should blame the producer/director on this too.

They used at least 2 higher end camcorders because I saw glimpses of them during the session.  Most other shots look as if they were shot on handheld camcorders in the $1000 or less range. The DVD could and should have been shot in HD; it wasn't. There is also substantial grain and pixilation compared to other concert DVDs out there. You'll also see bass drum shake! Thump from the bass drum and you'll get the shockwave though the video.

Delerium was great. They were tight (at least during the NYC show). The vocal mixing was a little off, but that's not them, that's the people that complied all of the material for this DVD. Next time, if there is a next time, RENT a half dozen high end HD cameras and crew. Get a company that will put out a superior product. Sit back and reap the returns and give the fans something they can tolerate sitting through more than once.",1298505600,11,1706,4.420382165605096
8399021,5,B003KWWDGY,"Great video of Delerium in concert, I wish the crowd attending get more into the music instead of looking verey stiff.",1293667200,,118,4.666666666666667
8399022,3,B003KWWDGY,"I love Delerium and heard it since 2000. It has evolutionate from industrial electronic to pop electronic and trance ambient.
This DVD is a concert about the last Deleriun era and is the one i like more.
I missed some very good songs and miss some very good female singers that play in the last albums but these two ladies sing very well too.

But what i more criticise is the length. Only one hour of concert too short for a band that has create more than 15 hours of music",1289520000,2,474,4.208791208791209
8399023,4,B003KWWDGY,"Overall this video is great - I've been a huge fan of Delerium et al. for more than 10 years, and this video does them justice (and is a nice look back at last year's tour/concerts - I went to one, and it was outstanding).

That said, I have one major complaint and one minor.  The major one is that the video mostly just works in DVD players.  I could only get it to work in one out of 3 computers I tried (2 PCs and 1 Mac).  At least I got it to work on one so I could transfer the files to my computer to watch, but that's just inexcusable in this day of digital media.

The minor issue is just the production feel of the box - it feels slightly cheap.  The cover art has pixelated images (as if the cover art designer didn't know how to design for print), there are no liner notes, and the DVD box seems like a generic box with just a sleeve insert.  Of course, the DVD was a bit cheaper ($14) than mainstream movies, but even at that price, it doesn't really feel like a professional production. The DVD content itself seems fine (other than the issue mentioned above) - it's just the box that's not up to par.",1289001600,2,1115,4.063926940639269
8399024,4,B003KWWDGY,"We may call Australia the lucky country, but when it comes to travelling down to your local club to see a quality act like Delerium, we aren't so lucky!! I have been waiting to see and hear Delerium live in the flesh for a longtime now (since the days of Semantic Spaces's release) and to now have the opportunity to finally catch them live in concert has made my year! With Australia being such an expansive country, travelling to see acts when they tour here can be a very daunting experience, especially when they only play in the capital cities (sometimes even just one city on the other side of the country!!)

Kirsti and Leigh do a great job in handling the vocal responsibilities, and it would be asking a big ask to have Jael and Sarah McLachlan on tour to do a couple of songs, but the live mix, faithful reproduction of the music to the note, and the masterful drumming of Ash Sood makes this DVD a must have for any Delerium fan's collection!

Now, let's see if Rhys Fulber can match this!! That would be very good!!",1288137600,5,1027,4.4
