While Pia offers a fair amount of common sense, there is too much talking and too little training to make this your first choice if you are looking to buy.  There are simply better, more professional dog training DVD's on the market.  While almost all the commands you'd want to know are here, too many of the dogs have already learned the commands or seem too preoccupied or bored to be learning what's being offered. The lack of production value shows up in many little ways.  For instance, teaching your dog name recognition, a prerequisite for learning almost everything else, doesn't show up until the middle of the video.",1174262400,4,715,4.606299212598425
8039355,1,B00066TBFS,"I bought this DVD in hopes to learn a few good things to teach my Lab. But that's not what happened.

What I did get out of watching this dvd was that I should have just signed up at Pet Smart for their dog training class.  This didn't have any real life scenarios using an untrained dog.  They used trained dogs throughout the entire thing.

From what I can tell from other's reviews on these ""Fun To Know"" series, the producer Millennum Interactive, Inc. is just out to put something on a dvd and put a pretty label on it and sell it as ""Professional.""  Yep, it's professional all right, professional waste of time in my opinion!",1158969600,6,631,4.358974358974359
