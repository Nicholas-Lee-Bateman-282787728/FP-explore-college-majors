2838220,4,B000QGDY06,"I could not help but remember the wonderfully enigmatic short story by Guy de Maupassant.
  Starring the beautiful Sandra Bullock. One of the few actors in the industry who can hop-scotch from comedy to drama without hesitation...and pull it off.
  Read the other reviews but be careful. You either pay attention to what's going on or you'll be lost within minutes.
  It's a thriller. Do not look for a surprise ending. Do look for an epiphany of sorts that will satisfy the storyline and, more importantly, the viewer.
  Good acting all around. Good direction...except isn't it about time we did away with the CGI quickening clouds that signify...whatever?
  Lots of worthwhile extras on this disc.
  See it.",1184630400,6,709,4.965811965811966
2838221,1,B000QGDY06,"And The Lakehouse was really awful. When is someone going to write a time-travel movie that makes sense? ""The Butterfly Effect"" was far more interesting and more cleanly written and required a little thought on the part of the viewer and *that's* what made it compelling and intriguing and thought-provoking.

My eldest daughter and I were watching Premonition when I explained how I thought the writers would explain the time travel aspect and she replied, ""Mom, that's brilliant, but I don't think this movie is even going to visit the land we call 'brilliant'"".

And she was right. There's no explanation for the mix-up in ""Linda's"" days and no effort to bring a little science into the picture. When Linda feels like she's truly at the end of her rope, she visits the neighborhood priest who tells Linda about a 17th Century woman who had a premonition of a massive storm and was later burned at the stake for being a witch. Huh? All the great stories in the world about people who have jumped around in time and that's all Father Suburban could offer her?

Einstein stated that, the past, present and future are only an illusion, however persistent. So, perhaps this little thing we call time is not really linear (with a past, a now and a future), but that's the way our little brains are designed to interpret it. Perhaps Linda catches a glimpse through the human illusion we call time and sees that time is *not* linear and perhaps she sees, for a moment, that time is *not* moving forward at one speed and one speed only. Perhaps that could explain the mystery and mystique of her experiences.

But this soppy, sappy and sloppy film never even dips a toe in the murky (yet fascinating) waters of quantum physics.

Save yourself two hours and watch the trailer. It's much, much better than the movie.",1184371200,9,1808,4.672955974842767

The next day, he's dead again and funeral arrangements are being made! Every day of the week is a different day, and they are all mixed up! What is going on? Is the woman crazy, confused, or what?

Be prepared to keep guessing and to keep being wrong until the end of the film!

Sandra Bullock gives a great performance as the grief stricken widow Linda Hanson. This is a film you will want to see more than once to put the pieces together. It's part Sixth Sense, part Lake House, part something totally unique. Great movie!",1182729600,73,681,4.354330708661418

2838225,4,B000QGDY06,"Sandra Bullock plays a housewife who finds herself caught between two worlds where she can predict a tragic event before it happens and then where the tragedy has already happened. One day, a police officer comes to her door disclosing the news that her husband was killed in an auto accident. The next day she wakes up, goes downstairs and finds him drinking coffee in the kitchen. Everything seems normal that day until she awakes the next morning to find her friends and family preparing to attend his funeral. Linda(Bullock)continues to feel as if she's in the twilight zone with each waking morning. The days that make up an entire week and the sequence of events that take place within those days come off as choppy and inconsistent until she begins to piece the clues together in an attempt to prevent her husband's death. Without going into more details, Premonition is compelling enough to keep you wondering and guessing what might happen next and which incident could or should follow the other. The end result is a good enough mystery with ties to religion, the supernatural, and twists of fate-some she couldn't change and others, well, you'll see in the end.",1182211200,9,1172,4.835820895522388
2838226,3,B000QGDY06,"I was one of the few critics who actually enjoyed Sandra Bullock's last time travel film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lake-House-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000HEWEE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lake House (Widescreen Edition)</a>. That one was a romance in the vein of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Somewhere-in-Time-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00004W46I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)</a>, while Premonition is a thriller more along the lines of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forgotten/dp/B0006IIKQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forgotten</a>.

Unfortunately, Premonition is no better than The Forgotten (in fact, it has a lot fewer ""scares"") and uses the same loco logic at the end to explain the terrifying time warp (terrifying for Bullock's character, if not the audience).

The story follows happy housewife Linda Hansen and her hunky hubby Jim (Nip/Tuck's Julian McMahon) in their trip through time, following -- and previous to -- Jim's death in a fiery car wreck. Since Linda is the only one aware that the weekdays are all out of order and sometimes repeating themselves with different outcomes, everyone else around her just thinks she's a raving nut-job.

Linda is... sort of cosmically... sent to a psychiatrist (Peter Storemare... c'mon... who'd accept a prescription from that guy?) and put on anti-psychotics. Needless to say, that doesn't help and Linda finds herself jumping all over the calendar again. Unfortunately for loopy Linda, going back and forth in time is hardly helpful -- she's unable to remember what's happened in those alternate realities and is therefore powerless to stop the inevitable.

While there is interesting cinematography and jarring sound design, no amount of visual and aural accoutrements can disguise the fact that not only is Linda's life boring, but so is she. No wonder Jim goes on so many business trips (and we all know what that means!).

The only person who seems to understand what Linda is going through is her priest, who conveniently has several appropriate pages of the Bible bookmarked for her unheralded arrival -- but instead of support, Linda gets a spiritual upbraiding and is sent on her way, answerless.

The same could be said for the audience, many of whom will no doubt exit the theater scratching their heads and cancelling their subscriptions to Christianity Today. Premonition is so bad, there's even a scene mirroring the time when the old nighttime soap Dallas jumped the shark with Bobby Ewing in the shower! And the ending? ...I felt a queasy combination of morning sickness and Deja Vu. **Horror.com's review (2.5 stars)

2838227,3,B000QGDY06,"For those who give this movie on here bad reviews, first off, you people wouldn't know a good movie if it hit you over the head. Why don't you actually give it a chance instead of saying its boring and whatnot. Let me start by saying that Julian McMahon is the best actor in the world. Although I wish there were more of him in this movie, he gives an outstanding performance, and damn, I wish I was playing Sandra Bullock's character. I could watch this movie over and over again, and why? Because it's such a touching yet melancholy love story. The only part I will not watch again is the end. I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it, but if you're a big fan of Julian McMahon, be prepared to do a lot of crying. Good or bad crying? I will not say. All I have to say is that this movie really makes you realize what's important in your life, and anyone who didn't get walk away from this movie with some kind of empathic connection to one of the lead character would have to be crazy.

For those of you who have seen it and love it, good for you! You rock! For those who haven't seen it yet, don't even listen to the bad reviews here because these people don't know what they're talking about. Give the movie a chance, if only to see just what a sweetheart Julian McMahon is as a father. He said that he didn't have to to put on an act when he played, Jim in this role. He just had ""to be,"" and for God's sakes, the man is a sweetheart in real life and has a daughter just like in the movie! And you know...who would pass up the chance to see Julian in the shower? ;D

If you see this movie, SEE IT FOR JULIAN!!!",1176940800,4,1622,4.03416149068323
2838228,2,B000QGDY06,"Ever wake up, go to work, and have a co-worker ask what day it is?  ""Wednesday,"" you tell them.  ""Huh,"" they say.  ""It FEELS like a Thursday.""  Sometimes the ""feel"" of time throws us a little off whack, us wandering through Tuesdays that feel like Fridays, or trying to wrap our minds around the ambiguous dreariness of Sunday afternoons.  ""Time is an illusion,"" Douglas Adams once wrote.  ""Lunchtime doubly so.""

Screenwriter Bill Kelly was probably inspired by similar ideas of time when he wrote ""Premonition,"" a thriller starring Sandra Bullock as Linda, a woman who keeps waking up on the wrong day.  At the beginning of the film, she learns that her husband has died in a car accident, but the next day, she opens her eyes to him lying in bed next to her.  And the next day he's dead.  Then he isn't.  Linda, understandably, is confused.

You will be, too.  The script doesn't bother explaining why Linda is ""unstuck in time."" (I quote the recently deceased Vonnegut's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slaughterhouse-Five/dp/0385333846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slaughterhouse-Five</a>; the movie share's that book's ambition, but certainly not its skill or import)  There's a brief (and laughably cliched) scene where Linda, seeking answers, visits a priest who offers the standard, inoffensive and nondenominational advice that she must have faith ""in something beyond yourself.""  Linda leaves the church, sporting the same expression she utilizes throughout the whole movie: dull consternation.

It's just as well; given the movie's themes, she should've visted a Calvinist.  There's a lot of hooey here about fate and determinism (hard plot points NOT to bring up when you're talking about characters who can see into the future; see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minority-Report/dp/B00005JL78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minority Report</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination/dp/0780631684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination</a>), but all this movie really amounts to is watching Linda try desperately to makes sense of all of the inconsistencies that you yourself will be mulling over by the time the credits close.  Because she leaps forward and then back like a kid on a time-travelling swing set, she must make sense of what has happened and what will.  The film ties some things together (the appearance of Lithium in her medicine cabinet, strange cuts on her daughter, and a dead bird in the yard), but the jagged timeline makes all of it hard to comprehend.  Even harder to understand is how Linda herself fits into the whole thing.  Does she change anything?  Can she change anything?  SHOULD she change anything?

It's a big mess.  A great big mess.  The preponderance of plot holes (which could conveniently be sewn up with a little long-shot rationalizing) is made worse by the emotional monotony of the film.  Not only does Linda teeter on an unoriginal chasm of madness, but she's teased over the edge by a slew of characters straight out of Central Casting.  Say hello to the Patronizing Mother, the Amiable-but-Unhelpful Best Friend, the Precocious Daughters, the Sinister Shrink, the Emotionally Unavailable Husband, the Strange Other Woman Standing Behind a Distant Tree During a Gloomy Funeral Who Suddenly Bolts when She is Spotted by the Dead Man's Wife!

There's a message in Linda's madness, true to form, and just like the characters, it pops up prepackaged and ready for sale.  It is, in fact, the final insult in a movie filled with smug, hallucinatory meandering.  I'm not talking about the climax, where all of the unstuck days finally coalesce in a chubby ball of fire.  I'm talking about, literally, the last shot of the movie, a screen-scene dripping with so much vague and vapid hope, I'm surprised the Kindly Old Priest character isn't in it.

I'm a huge fan of Sandra Bullock (she was my first on-screen crush, actually), but she is lost in the morass of this mind-bender of a movie.  One gets the feeling that her Linda could've benefited from something as simple as a Page-A-Day calendar.  The rest of the movie, though, needs a lot more help.",1176422400,5,4252,5.47926267281106

It is about what appears to be a loving family, husband, wife, and two daughters. One day she is visited by the sheriff who tells her that her husband was killed when his car was hit by a truck. But the question that must be asked in view of what follows is: was she actually visited by the sheriff? For what follows are a day when her husband is alive, followed by one where he had died, followed by one where he is alive again. Days are also out of order. On one day she is at her husbands funeral followed by one where she is making arrangements for the funeral.
There are also some events that do not make sense until the end, such as her husband buying a lot of insurance on his life on the day of the accident, just before driving away. And there is another woman, and this woman shows up at the funeral.",1504051200,2,1025,4.23469387755102

It moves a little slow at times, but her performance balances it out enough to give it 4 stars.",1443139200,,440,4.313253012048193

I'm not saying I enjoyed it, since I was tense from beginning to end but...that is the idea when you watch a psychological thriller. Nevertheless, I have to agree with the naysayers on one issue: I found the unresolved subplots...like Dr. Roth's treatment and her hospitalization...to seriously impede my enjoyment of the movie. Note that I've only subtracted one star, although those faults were major ones, because the sheer keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat was superb and Bullock's acting was excellent. A good movie if you're not bothered by the details. I would have preferred a tighter plot package--like Sixth Sense, as some have mentioned, or Angel Heart. But don't mind me--I watched Something's Gotta Give years ago, and I'm still troubled by the glass of wine that disappears then reappears in the sister's hand during her conversation with Keaton in the kitchen.

2838361,2,B000QGDY06,"Linda Hanson tries to stop her straying husband's death in this somewhat suspenseful thriller starring Sandra Bullock.

Linda (Bullock) wakes up on Thursday, alone. She takes the kids to school, does some laundry and sits down with the answering machine.

After listening to messages - with hidden meaning to the audience, at least at first- she continues her normal routine until the county sheriff appears on her doorstep with devastating news: Her husband, Jim (McMahon), was killed in a horrific car accident.

She sleepwalks through the day, only to wake up - several times - on different days of the week of her husband's death, the symbolic crows dogging her every step. Each day is out of chronological order. One day Jim's alive, the next his severed head is spilling out of his dropped coffin. Linda finds herself desperate for answers, and eventually has to create a calendar of events to figure out exactly what happens the week of Jim's death. Eventually she finds herself in the company of a kind-hearted priest, who talks to her about faith.

Through her painstaking and somewhat suspenseful journey, the audience pieces together the refuse of a marriage gone bad, a woman without a sense of self and a storyline that Rod Sterling or Alfred Hitchcock would have taken to a level only they could create.

Ninety-six minutes in length, Premonition is off to a good start, with string-instrument music and excellent camera work to get the Hitchcock creepiness factor moving. The problem? The last 30 minutes of the movie diverts the plot sharply from creepy to heartbreakingly ironic.

And that just doesn't work. What does work is the ending chosen as a DVD alternate, which offers a Twilight Zone twist that is more consistent with the flow of the rest of the film.

Bullock and the cast offer good performances. If not for fine acting, Premonition would have been a super dud. It is definitely not a ""psychological thriller,"" as promised on the cover, but it's not a mind-numbing Paris Hilton flick, either.

Included with the DVD are the alternate ending, a handful of deleted scenes, a mediocre gag reel, real premonitions and a commentary with Bullock and director Mennan Yapo.

2838371,1,B000QGDY06,"I had heard this movie was terrible, and out of sheer curiosity, i got it and watched it, and oh man.
This movie is terrible, but not because of the sub-par performances, or the ridiculous plot, or the inconsistencies, or even the terrible ending; it is terrible because it misses, or missed better yet, the point of the film it was trying to be.

In the mid to late 2000's, there was a slew of films that came out that tried to be psychological, or mind bending, or just had a stupid twist ending, and to be honest, none of them worked. And here's why...

In Premonition, the plot stops working almost immediately after scenes involving cause and effect.
For all intents and purposes, this is a time travel movie, but remember those inconsistencies I mentioned earlier:

1. If the protagonist starts on a day (the present) and goes back in time over night (none of the time travel-esque elements are ever
  explained) to a day in the past, shouldn't she remember what happened on that day

2. If the protagonist goes back in time to a day she already lived, shouldn't there be two of her

3. If the filmmakers where trying to convey an aspect of reliving a day that the protagonist already lived, doesn't that technically make
  it a different day (doesn't that mean that the films universe/timeline should split into an alternate reality/parallel universe?)

4. If the protagonist interacts with the environment in the past based on circumstances in the future, shouldn't she remember doing
  these things (she finds a torn phonebook page in the trash, and when she goes back in time, she rips the page out of the phone
  book for no reason and throws it in the trash; what would've happened if she hadn't torn it out and threw it in the trash?)

5. If the character meets people in the future that claim they've met her at some point in the past, should't she remember them

6. At no point in the film does the character ever have a ""premonition"" (everything that happens actually happens, she never
  dreams in the course of the film, and she doesn't even see what happens in order to prevent it)

7. If the days are occurring out of chronological order in reality, but are still affected in a manner that portrays chronology, does't that
  technically make them chronological? (this is a bit confusing, but the whole ""not in order gimmick"" is why this movie seems
  jarring at first, until you eventually realize just how convoluted and ridiculous it really is)

8. If the plot starts on the day after the tragedy, then jumps around while leading up tot he day of the tragedy, wouldn't it make sense
  if the plot started on the day of the tragedy (portrays what may happen) and then ends on the day of the tragedy (the protagonist
  figures out what lead up to the events of the tragedy and amended to prevent it)

9. Taking #8 into account, shouldn't the film portray a single isolated open but eventually closed loop? (Think about movies like
  ""Looper"" or ""Donnie Darko"", both of those films kept the audience guessing on where and why it began, and then lead up to an
  ending that explains how we arrived at that point in the first place)

10. Taking the latter of #3 into account, does the film portray a reality different to the one created in the remainder of the film?
  (the day of the tragedy is obviously two different days, because the first time the protagonist wasn't there to see it happen,
  but it was the second time that the protagonist (along with the audience) saw the event occur); given this logic, that would mean
  that the first days of the week are replaced by new days (the ones in the film) and the latter are replaced by days in which the
  protagonist has new memories involving watching the tragedy and trying to prevent it (so, there are actually multiples of each day
  because if the character lived the day once, was sent back in time to live it again, and then jump forward and then backward
  after obtaining new information and memories, they'd live it a third time (actually, they'd live the first day four times given this logic)

I could keep going but It's become to confusing.

This movie doesn't make any sense; as i have deconstructed it above, not only is it lacking any form of logic or reason,
but what makes the movie completely pointless is the fact that she doesn't even prevent the tragedy that kills her husband.
The whole movie is built around her trying to get back to the day on which it occurred, and even after she does, he dies anyway.

So ultimately the climax that would've at the very least given the movie some merit never happens, and really the only thing that the audience was waiting in anticipation for is now gone.

Not only can I not recommend this movie, but I can't even give it a rating that is anything less than

0%- Premonition is a film that tries so hard to confuse the audience just to feel intelligent,
  and in the midst of its horrifically ridiculous plot and execution, all logic, reason and merit
  disappears, leaving a film that is absolutely pointless in every sense of the word",1416700800,5,5073,4.5458563535911605

The movie itself is very entertaining. Mysterious and creepy without falling into the category of horror, so people who don't like ""scary"" movies will probably still enjoy this one. Sandra Bullock does a good job of selling a character in an extremely emotional, scary situation, without over-acting. It's most fun to watch this mystery without knowing anything about it, but read on for a vague description. A woman, married with two daughters, goes about doing her regular routine one day and is interrupted by an officer coming to her door to inform her that her husband was killed in an auto accident the day before. She reaches out to her mother and best friend and breaks the news to her children. The next morning, she wakes up, goes downstairs, and slowly walks into her kitchen to find her husband sitting at the counter watching the morning news. Her friend has no recollection of receiving a phone message from her the day before. The story progresses from there and Bullock's character is alone in facing/figuring out the mystery.

The movie is an easy watch. Entertaining and has twists, but isn't too complicated. Probably won't watch many more times, since I know the ending, but it was still worth the purchase.",1414368000,,1402,4.789256198347108

And the only way to fix it, is to go back in time yourself.....back into these visions your having and make a chart to fix this all yourself. Now I was surprised by this flick......seeing it years ago.....we rented it when I was about 20 to see what it was all about ( and since I've loved scary movies since I was 8 I can always pick good ones...and I've always thought Sandra Bullock was pretty cool. But this didn't have the ending I was expecting. It Really does catch you off guard because in each vision she has....she's slightly off in some way because she keeps trying to save her husband......(and at 1st it's like .....is this a dramatic version of Groundhog day? (Lil joke, But still not a bad comparison) Cause in THIS case NO, and she DEFINITELY wouldn't be playing ""I've got you babe."" When she finds out her husband's been unfaithful 2 her.....Time stops....everything re-sets itself and she can move on with her life.

2838433,3,B000QGDY06,"My bargain-rack movie  for last night was ""Premonition"" starring Sandra Bullock. I found it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart. I have very mixed feelings about the movie. The photography and sound were rather good. The acting was good. The movie was well put together, without question. Yet it just didn't jell as a movie. Well, that's too bad. It looks as if a lot of effort went into this film, but I just didn't care for it.

The basic story is  that a happily married wife with two beautiful little daughters and a nice new home had a dream or premonition that her husband had died. Well, we've probably all had things like this happen and it can be a frightening experience. Okay, from that point on the movie takes on an artsy set of scenes or small stories that go back and forth from his death to his reappearance, to his funeral, to his reappearance and so forth. Back and forth, back and forth, then sideways with little stories about one of his daughters being injured, then she's partly healed, then she's totally healed, then the accident in which she's injured is shown, and so forth. All of this gets to be incredibly complicated, so complicated that the wife (Sandra Bullock) set up a chart to plot all of the events to try to understand and make sense out of it. My advice would be that the viewer set up a similar chart or you're not going to be able to follow the story. Personally, I doubt that you can follow it with the chart.

Well, this could have been a simple and emotional story, well told. But it wasn't well told. It was muddied to the point where it was very difficult to follow. What's the point? All this back and forth, sideways, back and forth, up and down didn't really add anything to the simple story. All it did was take the viewers through a bewildering set of twists and turns. And then there's the end, a tragic car crash and the closing credits appear. Well, best of luck. I hope you enjoy it.

2838461,4,B000QGDY06,"******Contains spoilers******  I thought this movie was pretty good, however there were some pretty big plot holes.  Basically, Linda expieriences a week out of her life in which she lives the days out of order and the main idea is that her husband Jim dies.  The breakdown.  Thursday, Monday, Saturday, Tuesday, Friday, Sunday, Wednesday.  Lets forget for a moment that the previous week, she went to bed on a Saturday night and woke up Thursday morning as Thursday is Day 1 of the week as she experiences it and is the day she finds out her husband is dead.  She did mention to her friend on the phone that she didn't know where the week had gone, but she literally hasn't experienced it yet, so that in itself is wierd.

Ok, instead of breaking this movie down in the way she experienced it, I will break it down according to how it went chronologically to express some plot holes.  I will also add a number value to the date so we know the order Linda experiences it.

Sunday(6): Linda wakes up and asks Jim to spend time with thier two girls.  She goes to a church and speaks with a priest, not sure what to fight for in her life.  She feels lost.  Before the girls go to bed, Jim tells them that he loves them and that he loves thier mother very much.  During a thunderstorm that night a crow is electrocuted and lands in the yard.  Linda misses him and wants things to be the way they were before and they make love.  She knows they don't have much time left.

Monday(2): Linda wakes up and Jim is downstairs drinking coffee.  Day 2 for her, so is shocked to see Jim is still alive.  She figures it must have been a dream.  She goes about her day like any other day.  She gets pulled over by a cop, and it is the cop who told her that Jim had died.  He lets her go with a warning.  While hanging up some sheets to dry, she trips and falls and puts her hands on the dead crow and disposes of it in the trash.

Tuesday(4):  Linda wakes up while Jim is in the shower and holds him.  He goes to work.  She meets Dr. Roth who prescribes her Lithium.  She looks in the trash and the dead crow is being eaten by hundreds of flies.  She meets Claire, her husband's almost other woman, while visiting Jim at his office, trying to pursade him to take a trip with her and the girls.  Later, she ends up dumping the Lithium pills in the sink.  One of the girls, Bridget, runs into the sliding glass door and and is rushed to the emergency room with cuts all over her face.  She thought she had put stickers up on the sliding class door. but none were there.  She tells Bridget she is beautiful and covers up all the mirrors in the house. She also realizes what is happening to her with the days not matching up and draws up a calender week to try and figure out what is happening.  She pleads with Jim that if tomorrow is Wednesday to wake her up before he leaves.

Wednesday(7): Jim is driving in his car, he calls Claire and tell her he can't be with her, as she was waiting for him in a hotel room.  He dials home and leaves a message on the answering machine, but Linda is calling from her cell phone and he picks up the line.  He tells Linda he loves her and then dies after stalling out and being hit by a semi truck.  She witnessed the whole thing.

Thursday(1):  This day is the first day Linda experiences in the week and therein lies the plot holes.  The mirrors in the house are no longer covered, and Bridget has no scars.  She does not notice the Lithium bottle in the sink.  She puts up stickers on the sliding glass door.  She learns Jim died in a car accident after playing the message he left the day before.  The girls work on a puzzle with thier grandmother who is staying the night to help Linda out.  She falls asleep on the couch holding a picture of her and husband when they got married.

Friday(5):  Linda wakes up on the couch.  She pretty much knows what is going on at this point and confronts Claire.  Claire tells her that Jim never cheated on her, although he was going to.  She makes all the funeral arrangements and has some wine before bed, wondering if letting Jim die is the same as killing him.

Saturday(3):  The day of the funeral.  The is the also the day that she first notices Bridget's scars and that the mirrors are all covered.  This is when she also notices the Lithium bottle in the sink.  She is later committed by Dr. Roth

I basically told the story this way to demonstrate the plot holes.  While Thursday is the first day she experiences, she still should have noticed the scars, the mirrors, and the Lithium bottle that day.  I understand in order to make the movie work, she couldn't have discovered them that quickly.  Perhaps I could let the Lithium bottle go if it were in a different place then the sink, a place one wouldn't look at every day, and if the cuts had happened on Friday instead of Tuesday, but that would have changed quite a few of the elements in the movie.

I think Linda could have done more to prevent Jim's death.  Certainly Tuesday or Sunday she could have used what she knows about the future to prevent his death.  She could have taken the girls and told Jim she was going out of town, with or without him, hoping he would join them.  She could have just told him the truth about what she was experiecing but he would probably think she was crazy.  She could have just told him that she had a very vivid dream and plead with him that no matter what happens, to stay away from highway 57 on Wednesday.  Tuesday night, she could have set an alarm to ensure she would wake up on Wednesday before Jim leaves the house.

All in all it was a great movie and I liked it alot!",1346112000,,5643,4.232645403377111

Anyhow, in this pitifully awkward attempt to create a 6th Sense look-alike, the filmmaker came up with a pretty good idea ... and then massacred it. The plot is that Linda (Sandra Bullock)predicts that her husband will die, then he doesn't, and then he does, then he doesn't, then he does.  (Repeat as often as necessary.) Like the stock market, he just crashes, only to return ... to crash again.  The problem is that in a movie like this, it gets just plain confusing when the main character keeps jumping around, not only in time, but into different plots. In one future scenario, she's committed to a mental institution by a shrink who looks like a member of the Russian mafia. In another she's sort of glad her husband is dead after finding out he was going to have an affair. It's no less confusing when she goes back in time, since all of those plots are inconsistent as well. Sometimes he's in the shower when she wakes up, sometimes the kids wake her up, sometimes she calls her friend, jogs, hangs laundry ... you know, all those fascinating things that make up the life of a woman who can predict death. And if the writer was trying to pull off some kind of time line interference story, in which the main character's actions somehow affect the future (which would account for some inconsistencies in the plot), he also needed to provide some kind of background.  Like why was the marriage going sour in the first place? (After all that was an instrinsic part of the story, or at least one of them.)

I got the strong feeling right around the time that the priest actually spells out exactly what this story is about (""Fight For Love""), that the writer was trying to deliver a message, which, in a movie is always a bad idea.  But like the rest of the script, Bill failed at that too, because in the touching reconciliation in which Linda and her hubby work out their relationship on their cell phones, while traveling in tandem, full speed, down the highway, it's Linda who actually ends up getting him killed. Frankly, I would seriously NOT be okay with that if I were the wife... or Sandra Bullock for that matter (I mean, did she actually read the script before she signed on the dotted line??). And I certainly would refuse to participate in any kind of ridiculous, uplifting final shot in which I tangibly and roundly demonstrated the miracle of life. AAAGGHHH!!!

2838479,2,B000QGDY06,"I see plot holes sinking this ship!

Premonition is about a woman, Linda (somewhat believably played by Sandra Bullock) who in some mysterious way is living out another time period where her husband dies about two weeks later.

What gets me about Linda is how it takes her so darn long to figure out what is happening.  For example, she sees a bottle of lithium that was dumped down the drain in her sink and has no idea how it got there.  She looks at the bottle and it has a doctor's name on it, Dr. Roth.  Then later, when she falls asleep she reawakens in her new world, looks up Dr. Roth whom she has not met yet.  She tries to explain what's happening to her, where she believes her husband is dead but he's not really dead.  Dr. Roth thinks she's nuts and gives her a bottle of lithium.  Later in the day, she dumps it in the bathroom sink.

Does she say to herself, ""Wow, that's just like in my earlier dream!"" Or say ""Maybe since I've reliving this before I will see what I can do to change it.""  Nope, no clue.  The audience (me) is frustrated that Linda is not figuring out any of this.

The characters are very cardboard.  Her mom, for example, has her committed to Dr. Roth's care because of something that happened to one of her children (we don't yet know why at this point).  No real explanation other than implying Linda somehow was responsible for her daughter being cut up.  Later in the tale, when she relives the earlier time (yeah, confusing, and convoluted) her daughter goes through a plate glass window.

Now, why would her mother call the psychs to lock up Linda if Linda had nothing to do with her daughter getting cut up.  Don't get it.

Oh wait, gets better!

Linda finally figures out (she's pretty slow) that she's reliving some other time.  She makes a calendar of sorts and starts to figure out what's going on, without telling her mom because of her predilection for locking up daughters in mental hospitals.

Another throw-away scene tries to explain what's going on.  A priest she visits (not sure who or why) opens a book (which is not explained where he got it) that goes over people reliving other times and see them as warnings.  He then goes over how some people can't change this because ""nature abhors a vacuum"" and that if you don't have faith or love then you are doomed to your fate.

OK, fine.  She takes this to heart.  She tries to love her husband and children more.  She tries really hard.  And then [SPOILER] the thing that she fears happens anyway, DESPITE her efforts!  Inexorable fate.  Can't change it, despite faith and hope.  Yuk!  [END SPOILER]

Sandra Bullock walks through her part, a bit clueless and has a cheating husband on her hands who is also clueless.

The script does not have that neat Hollywood polish of a happy ending which, frankly it really needed!

Like Clooney's ""Perfect Storm"", you love the characters and yet they meet their end anyway.  The film makes you feel empty and lifeless.  Not suicidal, but almost.

There are much, much better Bullock movies.  Skip this one.

In any case, blame it on the roses, blame it on the wind but I'm not sure I completely followed what all was going on.  Spoilers ahoy.  Read on if you've already seen the movie.

As far as I can gather, there seem to have been multiple possible histories competing with one another for actuality.  In one possible history, Sandra Bullock is estranged from her husband and they have a crumbling loveless marriage, though he does wind up falling all over himself to give her some head.

In another possible history, which seems not actually to have occurred, a sinister psychiatrist is drugging Bullock with... Lithium?  Did the screenwriter research this at all?  Lithium is not an antipsychotic, nor is it very widely prescribed for people whose heads are coming apart so bad they don't know whether they're Hall or Oates.  But Lithium, nevertheless, is most sinisterly prescribed.  I think the same shrink may have sinisterly suggested magnesium supplements as well, in a vaguely suspicious barely concealed French-Canadian accent no less.  Ah well.  But it was not to be, apparently.  Nor was it quite to be that Bullock gets popped into the loony bin for slicing her daughter's face up.

However the film-makers do at least supply a blooper reel featuring an assortment of mystics culled from the north of Britain (""I sez to me Harry, I sez, Don't let's tonight... it gives me a rum go.  An' that seam night the pub caeved in on isself, teakin' the souls of thirty football supporters down wi' er.""; ""Yar... I seen 'im: the Loch Ness Monster, sure as'm standin' 'ere!""; ""I seen the trein go off the rails, real bloody-like, joos like it duz in me bleedin' paintin's."")

But getting back to the movie, in the end, it does seem to have seemingly come to pass that hubby gets a bionic haircut from a jack-knifing gasoline truck... though one can't be fully sure this really happened.  After all, the movie in its entirety could have been a bad dream that the viewer... I mean Bullock, yes, Bullock, had and was now in the process of being disabused of as she walks out of the theater... I mean prepares to sell the house her husband bought with that raise he got for being promoted at whatever company he worked for selling whatever it was he sold.  It does indeed seem that the house her husband bought for her didn't bring them much happiness, and the poignancy of the movie resides in this subtext of family life gone awry and no possibility of touching those we hold dear.",1258675200,4,2644,4.633047210300429

Linda and Jim lead a perfect life. They live in an impossibly pretty house in the quietest and most picturesque suburb ever invented by Hollywood. They have two adorable daughters. And somehow Jim earns enough money to allow Linda a full-time mommy career without money worries.

The film begins with a tragedy. Linda wakes up and goes about her daily routine, expecting Jim to return from his latest business trip later in the day. She is stunned when a police officer knocks at her door and announces that her husband has been killed in an auto accident.

Linda copes, mainly by giving in to shock. She breaks the terrible news to her kids and asks her mother to stay with the family for a while. Tentatively, the women begin to talk about funeral plans.

The next day Linda wakes up, and cannot find her mother in the house. She goes to the kitchen and finds her husband drinking coffee, preparing for his business trip.

From this point on, the film unfolds in a series of events and possibilities. With each possibility, Linda must re-evaluate her feelings about her husband, the state of their marriage, and the kind of person she is. All of this plays a vital part in unraveling the mystery of her premonition or apprehension of her husband's impending accident. With each step, Linda feels more certain that she can change what is to be. But does she want to?

The producers of Premonition would be justified in wondering why their stab at the New Hollywood Quasi-Horror Genre was not a chart-busting hit. After all, they built in all the requisites:

* likable star (Bullock)
* a fixable family conflict
* something spooky messin' w/ likable star's mind
* complex narrative structure to impress viewers who can't follow it and flatter those who can
* big and accessible message about Life

Unfortunately this story is a bit too clever for its own good. But it isn't ruined by cleverness. It is ruined by sentiment. Cut the unintentionally hilarious funeral scene, a heavy dose of religion supplemented by a family vitamin, and a moment near the end in which Sandra Bullock shouts a phrase one too many times while barreling down the street, limbs Dave Attell-style-akimbo in fuzzy robe and slippers--and this thing might have worked.

But the producers didn't cut these things. Which means they didn't find them as funny as they obviously are. And when you don't know that your operatic funeral scene is guaranteed to elicit belly laughs, you probably shouldn't be dabbling in the New Hollywood Quasi-Horror Genre. Because this kind of film flies or dies on the ability of its creators to recognize humor when it slaps them on the back of the head.

In this regard the creators of Premonition don't seem to have a clue. Their story is so dour, and Linda is so sad, and the kids are so good and precious, and the setting is so perfect, it's borderline daytime TV material. There are no truly ironic or sardonic moments in the script. The characters don't share anything offbeat or charming that might win us over and make us want them to stay together. They're a typical, slightly disillusioned couple with no quirks or aspirations.

At one point the story seems about to get darker and weirder, when Linda appears to be responsible for a child's injury. But this line isn't pursued very far, and we're soon returned to the land of the impossibly pretty suburb of dreams. By the last, sappy scene, I just didn't care any more.",1252713600,5,3481,4.71828665568369
2838510,4,B000QGDY06,"This movie was really good.  Basically, without spoiling the actual storyline, everything you see in the beginning of the movie isn't actually happening.  The question is, WILL it happen, or will Sandra Bullock be able to stop it in time?

There's a twist at the very end of the movie that I NEVER seen coming, and to be totally honest, I don't quite understand what happened during the last two minutes of the movie.  If someone wants to explain it to me in the comment field below, please do!

Anyway, the acting was really good, Sandra's character was in good shape, the guessing game deciding what's happening in the present time and what HASN'T happened yet is something you will be trying to figure out for yourself while watching the movie.

Too many times I was never really sure what was happening for real and what was just a premonition of Sandra's character.  You love movies like this because you just never know if someones premonitions will eventually happen or if the future disasters that come to someones mind can be stopped in time.  This is another one of those movies, but done exceptionally well.  I recommend it.",1249689600,4,1135,4.691919191919192

I was surprised at how tight the story is and every minute, every word, and every movement had a part in this story. They actors were well chosen as from the beginning to end you believe their characters are real and that you are taking part in the story.

House wife Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) finds out that her husband (Julian McMahon) has died. And wake up the next day to find him there. This is only the beginning. Soon she realized that it is probably a premonition. The story is also filled out with what could have been and what may have been. And what should have been. Sandra puts us all in a different Zeite.

2838516,5,B000QGDY06,"I loved this film. It keeps you in tension throughout the movie and without a clear understanding of what is going on. It is an amaizing film, you have to see it and if you like Sandra Bullock, do not think it twice, buy it!!!",1236384000,,226,4.044444444444444
2838517,5,B000QGDY06,"I must say, this is a very welcome departure for Sandra Bullock after the recent romantic comedies and dramas which I have thoroughly enjoyed.  Sandra Bullock is my all time favorite actress, I really like her acting style.  As for Julian McMahon, this is the second role that I know of where he is the object of a premonition.  This movie is very well made.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, it takes another twist and turn.  It is a film that must be watched in its entirety to be enjoyed.  I first saw it on per-per-view (Movies on Demand).  After reading some not-so-favorable reviews, I thought I'd wait until it was available on cable.  I was pleasantly surprised, and then ordered the DVD.  Although we all enjoy the ""happily ever after"" fairytale ending once in a while, it was neat to see that the makers of this movie filmed a couple alternative endings, yet chose the least predictable.  Bravo!  If you adore Sandra Bullock, you won't be disappointed in this piece.  It was nice to see Julian again, too ;)",1234051200,,1033,4.524324324324325
2838528,2,B000QGDY06,"Sandra Bullock plays Linda Hanson, a wife and mother of two daughters. One day, after receiving terrible news about her husband Jim (Julian McMahon), she starts to have promotion - or I should say, she begins to experience things in ""un-chronological"" order.

I know my review is vague, but this is all that I can say without giving away the major plot elements. But I can add these yet: 1) Sandra Bullock is quite convincing as the tormented heroine, whose uncanny ability might or might not change the course of events. Most viewers would be impressed with her solid performance. 2) The material itself is fascinating, but the execution is ineffective with implausible situations and unlikely (even stupid) decisions by the characters. 3) Perhaps this is the most important. Her premonition (or whatever it is) looks convoluted, but the film's plot itself is fairly predictable. When Amber Valletta appears in one scene, most of you will instantly detect the identity of her character.

But what is really annoying is the attempt of the filmmakers trying hard to make the film profound when it is not. Director Mennan Yapo tries to give the film dramatic tension by introducing some elements - psychiatrist and priest - but they not only hit the wrong note, but confuse the already complicated story of the main character Linda. To make matters worse, supports are almost insignificant. Nia Long and Kate Nelligan appear, but their characters have virtually nothing to do.

""Premonition"" is built from several intriguing premises, but it is frustrating to see them wasted in the messy screenplay.

Not to be confused with Japanese film ""Premonition,"" which has nothing to do with this Sandra Bullock film.",1233446400,,1707,5.042553191489362
2838529,2,B000QGDY06,"I gave this story two stars because I actually watched the whole thing instead of turning it off in frustration halfway through.  So, the best I can say about this is that it is watchable.

This isn't so much a time-travel movie, just a time-error movie.  Sandra Bullock plays a woman who lives one of her weeks out of order.  She wakes up on a Thursday and is told by the Sheriff that her husband is dead.  However, after grieving she goes to bed and wakes up earlier in the week only to find him alive.  She thinks she only dreamed the previous day and it takes a few days for her to realize that her days are out of order.

This story could have been better.  The underlying story line is that the husband dies as he is headed out to have an affair.  So, does she let him die or does she try to save him?

The biggest problem is that there are soooo many inconsistencies.  The biggest were some cuts on a girl's face.  This ended up occurring on the Tuesday of that week yet she lives through an entire Thursday where she didn't have cuts.  Sandra Bullock's mother is concerned because she doesn't know how the girl was cut but there were enough witnesses to the account to have told her the truth.  There was one day that started off repeating another day so I'm wondering if the writers were confused... tryng to write a new version of Groundhog's Day but instead changing it to a miss-step in time instead without changing the fundamentals of the story.

And that is not all, but I think you get the idea:

Flaws, flaws, flaws.  Some I can forgive but this movie was riddled with them and it just destroyed it for me and took all the enjoyment out of it.  There was so much more potential than a house-wife losing his man to another girl.  Come on!!  The writers could have come up with something better than this!

Watchable at best, a complete time-travel flop at worst.

Oh, it is beautiful in blu-ray.  If you have the option, watch it in that if you want to catch this movie.",1233100800,3,1986,4.293800539083558

It is entertaining, and you have to stick with it to really see the pay off.  However, the gag reel on this disc's extras made me yearn for what I feel is Bullock's strongest medium:  romantic comedies.  You will enjoy this if you are a fan of hers, and Julian McMahon of ""Charmed"" fame does a great turn portraying her husband.  But somehow I felt this project was far afield of Bullock's best work.

Let's start with the cast.  Sandra Bullock is one of the least interesting actresses on the screen (on a par with Nicole Kidman) and I cannot recall one smile during the movie.  Her husband was also a zombie; well, less zombielike than Bullock.  No passion between them that I could see. I could see why he would want to cheat; she showed as much passion as a cold fish.

I got dizzy with was he dead; wasn't he dead but after ten minutes I didn't care at all.  The ending was no big surprise.

Just seeing him in the shower, lying in bed next to Sandra, etc.  Well  - yum.  Anyway, the story is exciting and intriguing.  Don't let the critics keep you from seeing this; if you like a juicy mystery, you'll like this.  Of course, it's not as touching as The Lake House, which was quite divine, but it had its touching moments, and, again, Bullock was fantastic.

2838560,3,B000QGDY06,"German director Mennan Yapo's first English language feature Premonition is a rather mixed bag. Its not really a thriller, its not really a horror film and it comes off at times as a confused mess.

Sandra Bullock plays Linda Hanson a comfortable suburban woman who at first glance appears to have everything. She lives in a great house, has at first blush a loving husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and two young daughters. One day she gets a knock on the door from the sheriff's department telling her that Jim has been killed in an accident and her seemingly normal life begins to unravel. The next morning she wakes up to find her husband alive and well. Is this a premonition that she has had or is she losing her mind?

Bullock takes on the role quite well but the non linear storytelling gets in the way of the audiences' enjoyment of the film. Days and events happen at random and the end result is more headache inducing than thrilling. Also, there is a tacked on quasi religious theme that is really not necessary to the story. The interesting question is  posed that if one know about future events does one have the power to change them? Sadly, this story line is not well developed.

I saw the regular definition widescreen disc. The transfer is quite good and the audio in 5.1 sound is clear and has no noticible problems. The score by Klaus Badelt is eerie and effective as is the cinematography by
Torsten Lippstock.

The disc comes with an array of extras including a commentary by Yapo and Bullock, deleted scenes with optional commentary, a gag real, a making of featurette, a completely unnecessary feature that tells the story in normal linear order and a double featurette on people who experience real life premonitions. A word on the commentary: it starts quite dry but picks up as the movie goes along.

This is not a bad package for a rental but it is far from one of the best movie of the year. With a lot of work it could have been so much better.",1214438400,,1970,4.519662921348314

Those scenes that don't involve her are totally out of synch with the theory of the film. Director Mennan Yapo did his best, but it was an unformed script and everything was kind of left to the imagination of the general public (those who don't see the ""holes""). Julian McMahon and Nia Long were fine, and the 2 little daughters gave great performances. As I said, it was good, mindless entertainment, but not a work of art.

Ain't gonna happen -- Sandra Bullock notwithstanding.

That, in a nutshell, is the experience of watching ""Premonition.""  The movie tries hard to be clever and thrilling, but just never quite rises to the ocassion.  Likewise, it tries to grapple with difficult issues like faith, God, death, and marital difficulties.  Tries, yes.  Succeeds, no.

This is one movie where a number of alternate endings should have been shot and screened with audience focus groups.  Without giving away a spoiler, I can almost guarantee that what the director/screenwriter chose here is NOT the ending an audience would have chosen.

For a thriller, this movie had a difficult time holding my interest.  I kept hoping that as the film progressed, things would make more sense.  Unfortunately, they never quite did and I had a very difficult time at the conclusion understanding which parts were actually real and which parts were simply ""what might have been.""  Frankly, it just was not possible for all that happened in the film over the course of a week to have actually happened in reality.

No complaints about the acting, the sets, or any of the technical aspects of the movie.  Sandra Bullock is one of my favorites and she does a good job coming across as a midwestern soccer mom who is mildly depressed about her marriage.  And Julian McMahon is believable as the responsible, passionless (at least for his wife) Mister Bland (although you do find it a bit far-fetched that this guy would be tempted to stray with a beautiful, pleasant-demeanored Bullock waiting for him at home every night).

But ultimately, the actors were asked to do the impossible: salvage a fundamentally chaotic and highly unsatisfying story line.

Within the first 20 minutes I had a premonition that this wasn't going to be a very good movie.

2838579,2,B000QGDY06,"This movie came out about the same time as another film called Deja Vu.  Both films dealt with time travel to some degree and centered around preventing a death.  This movie doesn't quite measure up to the other film.

It takes place over a week, however the days occur out of sequence.  Sandra Bullock goes to sleep with a seemingly happy family of two girls and a husband.  She wakes up to find that her husband died during an out of town trip that she doesn't remember.  She then goes to sleep and wakes up to find that her husband is still alive and the days seem to be out of sequence.  Her husband's death apparently occurred on Wednesday and each time Bullock awakes it is first a day later in the week from Wednesday then a day earlier in the week than Wednesday.

When Bullock starts piecing together what is going on with her, she has to decide if she wants to do nothing to prevent her husband from dieing or let things take her course (she learns that he may have been cheating on her).

When all is resolved, the viewer is shaking their head, specifically at Bullocks non-attempt to alter even the smallest thing (she finds a torn out page from the Yellow Pages in a trash can and when she goes back in time she realizes that she is throwing the same page into the trash can.  She could have done a little nuance to change things by removing the paper from the trash).

2838580,3,B000QGDY06,"""Premonition"" in some ways struck me as a more modern, more action-packed version of Thornton Wilder's perennial school drama class favorite ""Our Town."" In Wilder's classic, life is recapitulated and lived out of order as the result of a feverish dream.

In this drama, there is greater mystery and urgency attached to the protagonist's disordered experience of her life. We don't learn what causes the shuffling of days here.  Sandra Bullock's life inexplicably jumps ahead to a day when she is informed of her husband's death in a fiery car crash. When she is backtracked, she must race to see if she can avert the disaster.

Whether she can or not though, she is given a different perspective on her life. She is jerked out of the train of petty household grievance and is allowed to see the bigger picture of her relationship with her husband and family. Through the jolts of these changing gears, she's awakened, sometimes to a greater appreciation of the good, sometimes to a greater understanding of the bad, in her daily interactions. While we are usually told that the secret to living a happy life is to live fully in the ""now,"" this movie might incidentally make a case for being able to live our days as a spill of Scrabble on the table - where we have to search out the possible anagrams ourselves. Through the effort required in that back and forth and lack of linearity, there might actually emerge a greater clarity about what's truly of value in our lives.

This movie is not a sermon on how to live happily though. While I wouldn't quite classify it the way its DVD jacket does, as a ""thriller,"" its emphasis is definitely on the frantic suspense of - Can she or can't she? - of ""Run, Lola, Run!""",1197072000,2,1714,4.609836065573771

Because you experience the tragedy of Linda Hansen's husband's death as a precursor to the actual event, you wonder if the reason for the foreknowledge is to prevent the event if possible.

Then you wonder: If it couldn't have been prevented, what's the point to knowing ahead what would happen? The filmmakers did a good job of bringing meaning to what appears at first as a senseless tragedy. It was well acted and filmed.

I will watch almost anything with Sandra Bullock and I like Julian McMahon generally, but together they had no chemistry.  As much as I like mystery/suspense dramas and plots with twists, this wasn't one of my favorites.  Too many time jumps/flashbacks for my taste.

2838584,1,B000QGDY06,"I enjoy Sandra Bullock's acting and felt she was good in her role in this film, but the film itself was a big disappointment.  The writers wanted a thriller and had no compunction being inconsistent and inacurate in getting there.  They go for the easy shock -- arranging for a severed head to roll out of a dropped casket, without considering the fact that the fire-ball explosion in the accident causing the death would probably not have left anything to roll.

Worst of all, though, is the blatant inaccuracy of the film's title.  It's called ""Premonition"" but there is no premonition present!  The film is not based on what happens to someone faced with the problem of dreaming or otherwise tuning in on a future event and the difficulty of trying to cope with that future possibility in the present.  Instead, it deals with a person effectively stepping into another point in time -- out of normal chronological sequence -- and interacting with friends and family who are living a normal chronology of life. It's an interesting concept, but one having nothing whatsoever to do with premonitions.  The featurette, a  quasi-documentary on people who have had experience with premonitions, was interesting and fairly informative on the subject.  Too bad the writers couldn't have viewed that before creating the film.",1196208000,6,1319,4.986301369863014

Sandra Bullock is wonderful as a woman who is living a week in which every morning she wakes up to a different reality.  Everyone else - her mother, her kids, her girlfriend - seems to know what is going on except her.  She even seems to begin to ride the weirdness a little until the occurence of more sinister events.  There is a mysterious prescription bottle in her sink.  Is she losing her mind or is this a warning?  Even if it is a warning, how can she get out of the cycle if she can't get off the merry go round?

2838587,2,B000QGDY06,"This movie started out interesting enough with the out-of-order days and everything, but the writer missed a couple of things:

1) Why did the cop come to the door to inform Linda that her husband was dead, when, as it turns out, she was there when the accident occurred? You would think she would have called 911 and been there when the cops arrived. She would then be in the police report, and it would have been unnecessary for the sheriff to drive out to her house the next day to tell her the news.

2) OK, the first point was rather trivial, but here's the really annoying part: why the heck did airhead Linda tell Jim to ""turn around"" on the highway RIGHT BY THE HILLTOP? That was really smart! She knew the truck was coming, so she should have told Jim to wait for a truck to zoom by, THEN turn around (or better yet, creep to the top of the hill while remaining on the shoulder so he could see the traffic from BOTH directions)---DUHHHH! If he had done that, the accident would have been averted, and everything would fine. But no, stupid Linda had to BLOW IT!",1194480000,5,1069,4.313432835820896

2838622,2,B000QGDY06,"This movie started out interesting and intriguing.  A wife gets news that her husband has been killed in an accident.  Every time she lies down to go to sleep, when she awakens, she is in a different reality.  Sometimes her husband is alive again when she wakes up; sometimes he is dead.  I think I get the idea of what the movie was trying to convey, but it was done rather poorly and with enough plot holes to drive a semi through.  In her various new realities, she mends fences, ties loose ends and by the end of the movie, what happens is really not a surprise at all.  The problem is, many things are never explained.  For example, once she was committed to an asylum by her psychiatrist (in the dead-husband reality), why did she never again ""wake up"" in that reality?  There was nothing she did in the ""alive-husband"" reality to prevent her going down the road of being committed.  If I were her, actually, I would have resorted to some of the tactics in the old Nightmare on Elm Street movies, where everyone was afraid to go to sleep.  After all, every time she lay down to go to sleep, she never knew what reality she was going to wake up into.

Overall, I found the movie interesting, but annoying because of all of the plot gaps.  It could have been a great movie, if executed properly.  But as it was, it was barely mediocre.",1191369600,4,1339,4.350806451612903
2838623,2,B000QGDY06,"Sandra Bullock puts in a great performance of a confused and conflicted women unsure of reality.  Perhaps she was channelling how she felt about being in the movie, because the script is entirely undeserving of her attentions.
Not that it is completely without merit - the concept of a woman who lives the days of a week out of order giving her first a chance to know her husband is going to die, and then perhaps a chance to change it before it happens, is quite a good one.  The opportunity is wasted though, as plot logic flies through the window, along with our suspension of belief.  Apart from a brief chat with a priest, no explanation is given as to how this premonition happens, or why it would happen to her.  The plot therefore leads you on with the hook of `will she make it?' in a ticking clock sort of way, before fizzling out into a stock-heartwarming message about how we approach life being as important as death etc etc.  Not that it's a bad message, but the movie just does not decide which way it is going until the end... and it is too late to rescue an audiences involvement.
On the plus side, music is good - both suspenseful and melancholic by turns, and the acting across the board is good - with the exception perhaps of the husband, who fails to convince us of being the man that would hold Bullock's devotion the way he does.
Not a complete disaster, but neither is it worthy of a recommendation - for Bullock completists only.",1191196800,4,1455,4.414179104477612
2838624,3,B000QGDY06,"'Premonition' is a suspense film that scores a little low on the suspense-o-meter.  Linda Hanson (the fabulously talented Sandra Bullock) and her husband Jim (Julian McMahon from Nip/Tuck) have a happy life.  Nice home, two beautiful daughters, and a loving marriage.  Then Jim dies in a car accident, leaving Linda trying to cope with her loss.

But, when she wakes up the next morning, Jim is alive again, just like his death never happened.  But Linda remembers everything from the day before.  The film leaves you wondering which side of Linda's life is the real side, the one where she wakes up and Jim is alive, or the one where she wakes up and he's dead.  Small occurrences happen that tie the two realities together, such as a prescription from a psychiatrist and an accident with her oldest daughter.

The suspense of the movie never reaches a gut wrenching level, and the soundtrack became annoying at times with its consistent ""doom-and-gloom"" sounds.  It seems as if there's a message hidden that some things are in our control, and some things are not.  The ending was a little too clichd for my tastes.

Overall, the movie just didn't quite live up to its promises, but the performances by Sandra Bullock and Julian McMahon are exceptional, carrying the weaker direction of the film.  It's not a bad movie, just not a great movie.  Rent before you buy.  Enjoy!",1191110400,13,1375,4.771186440677966
2838625,5,B000QGDY06,"Okay, it's Sunday morning and Sandra Bullock suggests that Julian McMahon take the two little girls out for some Sunday fun, while she makes an emergency Sunday morning visit to her local Catholic Church.  Am I crazy or what?  When she gets to the church, it's completely deserted except for the kindly parish priest who tells her, ""Haven't seen you for a while.""  He has plenty of time to sit her down and tell her historical stories from his research into premonition.  Why didn't the Church have a few parishioners in it--why wasn't the priest saying Mass?  Maybe I had the day wrong, but I tore out a piece of shelf paper and scribbled a rough calendar with magic markers, every time I learned of a new terror for Sandra Bullock I wrote down what date it happened on, and my calendar as well as the screenplay, will swear in court it was Sunday morning.

I know it was before the older little girl flew through the glsss doors and cuts blossomed over her innocent, sulky face.  I think she was expressing the pain of her mom and dad's dissolving marriage.  After THE LAKE HOUSE and CRASH, we all wanted Sandra Bullock to smile again, but this time around she's gone off the deep end into ceaseless, unyielding depression.  Her mouth is pinched, her forehead a giant frown.  her hair is limp, lifeless, and jumps around her head like the strings of a whisk broom.  She's brave, my wife said to me, for she shares a few scenes with former supermodel Amber Valletta, who's lost none of her oomph over the years, and the whole audience is figuring, of course he's going to that motel with Amber Valletta, why put up with Sandra Bullock's frowns and complaints a day longer.

We learn from the priest that it's all about spiritual emptiness.  I think that perhaps the director, Mennon Yappo, was inspired by some of the late Ingmar Bergman's mid-period films like SHAME and THE PASSION OF ANNA and decided that, in Sandra Bullock, he had located the Liv Ullmann of our modern times, so he asked her to look glum, bought that fake bloody blackbird, got Kate Nelligan out of retirement, and hoped for the best.  In my humble opinion it's better than anything Bergman did, though let him rest in peace, in his Lutheran coffin of a churchyard.",1190764800,3,2238,4.576441102756892

In this movie Sandra Bullock, attempts at being psychic, are under played.  Her attempts to reconcile reality with her visions cause many issues.  One never knows wether or not we are in the present or the past, in the middle of a vision, or just a bad a dream.  It does not seem that the star is to aware of it either. In attempt to leave clues of what may happen and what has transpired it gets extremely muddy. But one cannot help but feel as though you were on a roller coaster ride without a seat retraint.

2838649,3,B000QGDY06,"I was looking forward for this movie to come out on DVD/Comcast OnDemand, but after thirty minutes into the movie I became more puzzled than ever.  At the end, I decided to watch it again like was the case of ""The Sixth Sense"" and other movies because maybe I missed something.

It reminded me of a very old episode of the TV series ""Ghost Story"" that featured a woman (Carolyn Jones) who relived over and over a time when she killed her husband, but you never knew if she did it yet or not.  I think that is where the writer got the idea for this movie--only the Ghost Story episode was much better.

I noticed the bong noise at intervals between scenes which may be indications that she was either going back to reality or back to the Twilight Zone.  It was hard to discern this and made me think that there were critical cuts made in the movie that fractured the storyline.  The overuse of fading to white (which is normally used to indicate death in film) also made it more confusing.

It was very difficult to keep up with the ""premonition"" and the real world in this film.  Although very well acted and very strange, I thought the audience deserved a better ending.  I'm thinking of getting the DVD just to see if there are any extras that explain the mystery of this movie as was done with ""The Sixth Sense.""

I give the actors and actresses a high score, but the editing ruined this movie.  I think whatever was left on the cutting-room floor should be put back in unless it is worse than what the audience got to see.",1189382400,6,1526,4.338028169014085

Maybe it's just me i really don't know,but i don't get the whole message,there's a priest in the movie who tells her she needs to decide on what to her is the most important thing in her life,so i'm guessing she chose her kids over her husband....or something? The whole death scene of her husband was down-right hard to believe,who sits in the middle of the road waiting to die. In conclusion,thriller?? by no means is this scary,the only part i saw in this film that they were actually trying to portray as scary was the dead bird.

2838654,4,B000QGDY06,"I was intrigued by the trailer for his film, but I was not able to see it in the theater. The trailer leads you to believe that this movie is a horror film, or at the least, a supernatural thriller.

I'm inclined to catagorize the film with the latter description, although the ""supernatural"" element remains more or less a mystery and the movie does not focus too much on that point.

It does focus, however, on the phenomenon that Sandra Bullock's character is forced to endure over and over again. This phenomenon is never fully explained, only hinted at, and that one fact left me somewhat disappointed.

However, once you get to the end of the movie and realize it's message, that one element lacking explanation doesn't really seem to matter. The movie has a beautiful message and that message is; every day of life that we have is a miracle.

Bullock delivers an excellent performance, as usual, and it was nice to see Julian McMahon portray a character who was actually a decent (if not troubled and confused) man rather than the megalomaniacal jerks he usually plays (such as his role in Nip/Tuck and Fantastic Four).

I enjoyed this film very much as did my wife. The picture and sound quality are both well-done. We especially enjoyed the gag reel after the film was over. It was helpful to get a few genuine laughs after such a tear-jerker of an ending.

The reviews are pretty mixed on this one, so you might want to try giving this one a rental before you buy. Like me, others may have pre-conceived notions about the nature of this film and could possibly be disappointed. I, for one, was pleasantly surprised.",1188777600,3,1625,4.625

2838681,3,B000QGDY06,"Relative newcomers, writer Bill Kelly and director Mennan Yapo, have concocted a testy little conundrum of a movie titled PREMONITION: whether the audience decides to step into their little nightmare or reject the premise that powerful emotions can drive the brain to peculiar directions of functioning will be the divisive break in acceptance of the film's premise. It is a fairly well done, thought provoking experience and is carried by some better than average performances by a strong cast.

The Hanson family is introduced as the husband Jim (Julian McMahon) and wife Linda (Sandra Bullock) buy their new home.  Jump forward after the credits to a family that now includes two young schoolgirls (Shyann McClure and Courtney Taylor Burness), a seemingly mildly depressed Linda and a workaholic Jim.  Abruptly, Linda is informed by a police officer that Jim has died in an auto accident and her close friend (Nia Long) and mother (Irene Ziegler) help Linda through the early moments of the tragedy.  Yet Linda continues to 'relive' moments: one day Jim is dead the next he is alive, and all of the pieces of the puzzle that erode Linda's mind become clues to investigate information she doesn't want to know. She encounters a warped psychiatrist (Peter Stormare) and a possible 'other woman' in Jim's life (Amber Valletta), and as she attempts to mold the puzzle pieces to make sense, she learns about the possible 'why' of the mental state in which she is trapped.

The film has problems holding credibility, but then the premise is a novel enough to allow such missteps.  Sandra Bullock takes over this role completely, gains our empathy, and in the end the film works because of her.  She is becoming an actress who is learning the value of understatement and that aspect of her craft serves her well.  No, this is not a great movie, but it is a well-produced little mystery that asks the audience to engage both mind and imagination, and that is a good thing!

It has a mysterious tone to it, which was nice, althought the first 10 to 15 minutes drag on a bit, as you know the sound of the doorbell is coming.  nonetheless, after finding out her husband is dead, than alive the next day, Sandra Bullock acts very confused and we start getting confused right along with her, which is fine at this point, since things are supposed to be confusing.  The movie and plot go downhill from there.  We never quite understand what is happening, and never really get an explanation as to why something happened.

When my wife made that comment, I was still hoping that at some point, things would become clear.  I was hoping for an ending like the one in the 6th Sense, but that never materializes.  I agree with a previous review that states that the main character knows what will happen, but just acts crazy and confused and does nothing to change the outcome.  This movie feels like it was put together very quickly, without much thought going into it.  Another review states that this is a movie for people who like to think, I could not disagree more, because if you really think about what is happening, this plot falls apart in no time.
In the end, when the abrupt end comes, the viewer is left confused about what just happened, with many questions unanswered, and finally, with the feeling that he/she has just wasted 96 minutes of precious time!  I gave this movie a shot because I liked the idea, and I like Sandra Bullock, but as I said in the title of my review, this movie was very flat, confusing, and not worth wasting your time.  I recommend reading a good book instead!",1187827200,6,1975,4.462395543175488

It is similar to 'The Time Machine' scenario however in that if the event at the end didn't hapen, there would be no premonition so she would be logically unable to prevent it.  In the end..Well, I won't say how it ends, but you could see it coming almost half an hour before it happened and it was completely unsatisfying.  In fact, two of us both had the same reaction:  Didn't this remind you of 'the Lake House?' I was tempted to give this baby only two stars but it was not unwatchable and if you had not seen 'The Lake HOuse' you might not have that feeling of 'Deja vu', which by the way was a pretty good film itself.

Sandra Bullock stars, but this movie lets her down. It's very good up until the last few minutes, when the Time Travel Paradox just doesn't work.

Linda has a premonition of injury to her daughter and fatal crash for her husband Jim, and subsequent events over the rest of the week. She finally puts this all together the previous Sunday, but fails to take any action to prevent it. She ends up causing Jim's death (and the tanker driver's), then leaving the scene of the accident (the police can't find her till next day).

The first time I saw it, happily on the day of its release, I found it tense from the first frame to the last. When it finished, I went home and thought about it for two hours. I love that kind of movie. The next day I thought about it some more, and talked to everyone about it.

The second time I saw it, in the second week of its release, I found the film nothing but pleasant from the first frame to the last. At the end, while I was smiling broadly, everyone else in the audience jumped up exclaiming ""WTF?,"" etc. I heard a few fellow patrons saying the movie should have had a happy ending. I had to answer them, ""It did have a happy ending. Think about it.""

I did not expect to enjoy it as much the third time, but I was wrong: I found it even more pleasant.

This movie got panned by viewers, critics and reviewers who were lost all along. That is only typical. People who are unaccustomed to thinking got their brains hurt, and they naturally blame the storyteller rather than their own underdevelopment. This movie helped me crystalise recent thoughts on the virtue of inaccessibility in art.

2838729,3,B000QGDY06,"We know Linda Hanson's marriage is in trouble from the opening scene in this film. Her husband Jim surprises her by buying her a house. Sure, it's gorgeous, but shouldn't that have been a joint decision? But in no time, Linda has decorated it to Pottery Barn Catalog perfection. She's such a Martha Stewart-style perfectionist that she even hangs her sheets outside to dry. Unfortunately for her, Jim has emotionally abandoned her and is considering an affair with a blonde female co-worker. All Linda's sacrifices to be a stay-at-home mom could come to nothing.

Consciously, Linda is the devoted, downtrodden wife. Unconsciously, things are going differently. She starts having vivid premonitions that Jim is going to die in a car crash and that she's going to be labeled as being crazy when she tries to get help. Are we surprised? Jim provides financially for her and their daughters, but he's a passive-aggressive heel--not only to Linda, but also to his would-be girlfriend. I'm surprised she didn't start having premonitions, too.

Linda's obsessive housekeeping comes to haunt her; her daughter runs into a glass door as they run to get the sheets out of the rain. Her daughter's injured face personifies her mother's wounded marriage. Linda's so upset about her daughter and her premonitions that she does things out of her neat-freak character--she rips a page out of telephone book, dumps pills in the sink and forgets to comb her hair. Linda's character falters here; she's just too self self-sacrificing--she's furious at Jim, can't she show a little anger and insight into her feelings? Also, Linda's mother seems to spend a lot of time at her daughter's house. Could her constant presence be a source of tension in the marriage? Maybe it's not all Jim's fault. The slow pace of this film reminded me of Douglas Sirk's ""Magnificent Obsession,"" where a husband also dies in a car crash, leaving an outwardly devoted wife behind.

Since the policeman at the door in her premonitory dream has given her her the exact location of her husband's upcoming accident, Linda drives to the site and tries to prevent it, but you can't change fate, I guess. And does Linda really want to prevent the accident after all?  As ""Premonition"" ends, Linda is pregnant, financially secure and back with mom. She's had a brief conversation with a handsome, gray-haired man at a lakeside development. Husband number two, perhaps? This time around, she'll be the one picking out the house.",1186531200,,2480,4.983091787439614
2838730,5,B000QGDY06,"The hook for this film, at least for me, was Sandra Bullock. The fact that she is in a reasonably Eerie film is a bonus.
Watching the film is very definitely a stream of consciousness sort of event, and works like a dream ( sort of like a light version of ""1408"" in that respect). So I never felt I was watching it for any sort of morality event, but I guess the key component is make sure you know what you love and care for, and Love and Care for it  every day, since you never know when it will be gone, in part or in full.
The DVD extras are mostly light, and don't add to to the movie experience; however, Making Premonition is a fun collection of documentary like moments, and the Commentary shows some insight about Sandra ( always a plus in my view), but after you have seen the film, check out ""Bringing Order to Chaos"" and ""Real Premonitions""; Bringing Order helps with the film, and Real premonitions show some chilling real life events.
Whilst PREMONITION may have been a relatively low budget film, it works well, it can be seen by many, it is not as Grotesque as the Butterfly Effect, but it is not about that sort of hard handed temporal paradoxes, it is a simple conundrum of what is the most important thing in my life.

Go figure.

I like Sandra Bullock. So I think I'm looking at Premonition through that mindset. I also love suspense and twisty plots. Bullock plays a solid character like she does in each of her films - a woman facing circumstances with varying degrees of self-control and courage. Linda reminded me of Bullock's character in Crash.

The plot had intriguing moments. Daily activities filled with quiet desperation set the scene for an unraveling marriage. Linda's realization of impending tragedy and then the cloud of surreality that surrounded her as she lived one very different day at a time made the movie clip along. The filming tended to be stark and clean which added to the suspense feel and evoked a sense of loneliness.

None of the characters were particularly lovable, even the children took a bit to warm up to.

The element of faith ended up being an empty platitude.

If you hated Lake House -- don't even try with Premonition.

If you are a mistake collector and will likely see the movie with a spread sheet and try to make all the parts create a seamless whole, I don't see how that's going to happen...so don't go there.

2838761,2,B000QGDY06,"A new era of films has arrived. This genre we'd like to call ""Alternate-Universe Melodrama"" that is full of characters that live in impossible situations, incomprehensive plots, cheesy explanation, and last but not least, movie stars with dying careers. The title says it all; Premonition is about a soccer mom who can see the future few days ahead by simple falling asleep. Does it sound like a cool concept? Indeed, but the story is so poorly explained that you'll get frustrated by trying to figure out what day she is in, and why she is having these strange visions--you might also get frustrated by how much screen time Sandra gets in this movie.

Brief Intro Story:
Premonition begins when Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) shows the new house he just bought for his young wife Linda (Sandra Bullock). They are thrilled about the house and this new beginning. Time passes by and now they have two young daughters. Everything seems to be going well for this family, but things are about to get ugly--and strange. On an ordinary Wednesday, Linda gets the worst news of her life. A police officer knocks on her door and tells her that her husband died in a car accident. Linda and her daughters cry their loss. Heart-broken and confused, she goes to sleep on her couch that night--her mom Joanne (Kate Nelligan) is also around the house to help her.

When Linda wakes up the following day, she is in her bed and wearing different clothes. She goes to the kitchen and yes, her husband is alive having breakfast! Was it a nightmare? She thinks so, at least at first, and continues with her day. Goes to bed again that night, wakes up and returns to the ""present"" where she sees family and friends getting ready for the funeral. She freaks out--anyone would, obviously--and tells everyone that her husband is not dead. What is going on here? She wonders. It didn't take long for Linda to discover that she can see the events prior to her husband's death and will try to stop it. As she investigates--one day at a time--she finds some dark secrets about her husband. Will she be able to change the future?

Review:
Unknown director Mennan Yapo brings to the big screen one of the most confusing films of 2007--very little drama and no mystery. It's not just the confusion that turns us off; it's also the plot holes that the movie creates as it goes on. Premonition never explains why she is having these visions--a cheesy explanation by a ""historian"" priest doesn't count. What's so special about Linda that makes her see the future in such a vivid way? Is it God, psychosis or just drugs?

Perhaps Sandra's ego was in charge of this film. She delivers a decent performance, but she is virtually in every frame. We see her running, shopping, sleeping, driving, smoking and even taking a shower three times--sorry guys, very little nudity. The whole story revolves too much on her and not the actual mystery. We know that she looks great for her age and that's fine, but too much of a good thing is bad. Could this be the ""Queen Bee"" Syndrome? I'm sure Jesse James (Monster Garage) is going to have this DVD in his personal collection.

Despite the dullness of this film, we find some scenes that actually worked--the ""open the casket"" moment was pretty dramatic, and the ultimate fate of her husband might shock some people. These dramatic moments gives us some idea of what Linda is going through, but they are short and far between.

The Verdict:
Don't say that we didn't warn you. Premonition is nothing but a dull, long and confusing film about a woman that for some strange reason can see the ultimate fate of her husband. If you watch it, don't try to figure it out because nothing makes any sense. If you're a fan of Sandra Bullock--you know who you are--and don't care about anything about the film, by all means go see this film because she is ""the film.""

2838779,3,B000QGDY06,"This is yet another Sandra Bullock movie I wanted to like, but the movie fought me every step of the way.  She is such a likeable actress and is so enjoyable on the screen.  Why does she end up with so many of these lackluster vehicles?

The movie has such a heavy mood that it would have to give us a big payoff to justify such constant oppression and depression.  But there never is a big payoff.  What there is one has to rationalize into it once the movie is over.

For me the movie was a kind of blend of Groundhog Day without the humor, Frequency without the active sense of doing something about the situation (to her credit, Bullock's Linda Hanson does come to grips with what she is facing.  However, I didn't.).

Screenwriters need to figure out that a sad ending has to be justified by either an uplift that makes it all understandable or an unsparing bleakness that cauterizes as it wounds.  This kind of dripping sadness is typified by Linda's visit with the priest.  She comes away with something that we can't really see and can only project in later, but she continues without any meaningful definition of faith nor is her commitment to God rekindled.

The whole time continuum disruption plot device is interesting and handled with appropriate fuzziness and confusion.  Linda isn't particularly an intellectual or analytical person, so she struggles in putting the pieces together.  Julian McMahon does a fine job as Jim Hanson.  He is a work obsessed man who loves himself and his ideas of his self-importance more than his family.  He flatters himself that he loves them and provides for them so that entitles him to ignore them.  That sounds like reality for too many families!  In the final analysis, this is a film about Jim and Linda and whether they can relocate their love and rekindle their marriage before it is ended one way or the other.

Not a bad movie, but in some ways not worth the work.  Still, it is Sandra Bullock.",1185321600,4,1951,4.586705202312139
2838780,2,B000QGDY06,"Even before the negative reviews and bad word of mouth happened, I knew this film would not be a good one. It just looked like another unnecessary remake of what wasn't even a good Asian horror film in the first place. But let's face it, and I'm probably not the only guy that thinks so, but Hollywood likes familiarity. When certain films get successful, their thinking is ""well the public probably wants more then"". Well no, we don't want tons of remakes; we just want good movies and sadly to say, Premonition isn't one of them.

Linda is a housewife married to Jim and has 2 daughters. One day, Linda receives the shock of her life when Jim dies in a brutal car accident en route to a business meeting. But strangely she wakes up the next day and finds out that he's actually still alive and hasn't even went on his trip yet. This continues as she wakes up and finds it a different day, husband's dead and every time she wakes up she's either seeing Jim still alive or long since dead. Can she change the future and save her husband's life?

In the original, a man loses his wife and child in a car accident but finds it hasn't happened yet however he can also see other's deaths before they happen and even prevent his loss. Here, she's basically caught in a time warp that for some reason just likes to mess with her. It's never really explained right away why she has to experience a certain day before another but then when it is and we see how her knowledge of things helps her in other situations we don't really care since they're kind of distracting. Can she save him or not? That's the whole point but we see other vignettes such as a creepy psychiatrist, a blonde woman, scars on one of her daughter's faces that you feel like ""come on already, get to the point.""

But this is a remake of a horror movie so in that basis: is the film scary? Well no, at times it's not even creepy. This is more a bad character study in how someone can grieve and experience traumatic events and whether you can change them so those of you looking for thrills and scares might look elsewhere. Of course sometimes certain screwy logic and an ever-changing timeline just makes kind of a mess of things.

In Crash, Sandra Bullock did a more dramatic role but thanks to the awful, contrived dialogue she didn't really feel like a full character. Now, since practically every scene has her in it she can flex her muscles although you kind of wish someone else was in it since she's always been that fun gal from Speed and romantic comedies. Julian McMahon, who I really only know as Dr. Doom from Fantastic Four films, is good but he's kind of underutilized. And you can tell Peter Stormare is lazy casting; not that he's bad but he's always played off-center types from Fargo and Armageddon so casting him as a creepy doctor just felt like easy casting.

Should you rent it? No. There are far better movies out there but if you have to absolutely see it, try it but I doubt you'll like it.",1185321600,4,2981,4.393115942028985

She wakes up on Thursday to two unscarred children, except her daughter's accident should've happened already.  If you are going to have a gimmick movie, you better have it thought through more thouroughly than that, because the flaws stand out much more apparently than the attempted message.

Other flaws...how does she need to get told of the accident on Thursday?  Because how does it get from Wednesday on mile marker 220 to her going away from the scene let alone to bed that night?  And the ending was so bad, they lead her away on Saturday night and then jump forward in time to an ending that is just grasping to pull something intellectually pleasing into a movie that has made you put your intellect into a coma in order to get through it.

With a little more planning this could've been a much better movie.  As it is, the only positive thing I can say is that its special features were enjoyable.  The gag reel was really funny, and the true premonitions section was really fascinating.",1185321600,5,1140,4.722222222222222

Bullock and the rest of the cast do the best they can with what they're given; the cast was not the problem. The scenes and music also were done rather well for a thriller. The atmosphere of the film is indeed perfect. But it's the story itself that makes you lose interest eventually. Like others have said here- the bouncing back and forth of days Bullock's character goes through gets confusing and overall tiring. The pieces do come together but by the time it all does start making sense you've already made your decision about how you feel about this film and most will say it was boring, messy and the ending was oh so predictable.

I was counting on Premonition to be a pretty good thriller, and although they set up the movie well to be one, it falls flat unfortunately. I recommend saving your money and just waiting for it to come on cable.

Their criticisms are valid for this film.

I suppose since the classic ""6th Sense"", everybody is trying hard to make films along the same idea (ie.. the ultimate ironic twist), but whereas ""6th Sense"" was unique for NOT being deceptive and actually telling you the punchline all thru the movie and STILL surprising you.......... films like PREMONITION (and many others these past few years) try to deceive the audience with false information that is simply thrown in to fool the viewer (and offers no meaning or content the the film).

PREMONITION is based on a good concept but only has enough substance to fill a 30 minute TWILIGHT ZONE episode.
As a result it really gets longwinded, repetitive and downright boring by the time 2 hours and 12 minutes (and the ending) come along.

The ending is no surprise, however the behaviour and stupidity of the characters at the end is so bad you are either annoyed -or- don't care what happens to them.

A good premise for a 30 minute Twilight Zone TV episode stretched too thin for a 2+ hour long movie... stretched so thin in fact it breaks apart into pieces the viewer probably cares little about.",1184976000,17,1416,4.716599190283401

2838802,5,B000QGDY06,"I really enjoyed this movie, and I like Sandra Bullock's movies anyway. This movie was about a woman who has dreams about her husband's (upcoming?)death. The dreams are in between dreams and reality. It's like she is flipping around between 2 dimentions. In one, he's dead. In another, he's alive. They are somewhat chronological. Each ""dream"" seems so real. Some seem to be visions of things that COULD happen, IF things progress on a certain track. As you expect, she goes through ""am I nuts?"" She tries to get help, but she is getting confused herself as to what is reality and others are not really able to help. Once she begins to track things on a calendar, she begins to get a handle on the situation. Then she starts to ask herself IF this is going to happen, can I stop it? Am I guilty of killing him if I don't? What the heck do I do?

Some people may not like the way this movie seems to flip around a bit, but many people who have premonitions or visions do not have them like a movie.  They are often fragmented and full of symbolism.  This movie spared you the symbolism.  It does jump back and forth in the dream world part, but I believe it is realistic.

2838808,1,B000QGDY06,"There is a skit in the animated program Robot Chicken where a caricature of M. Night Shaymalyn keeps shouting ""what a twist"" when we see little parodies of his films.  This is a poignant piece because it hints at one of the major problems in a post 6th Sense Hollywood, where filmakers feel they can woo in audiences with surprise endings and twists and turns throughout the story.

In films like the 6th Sense, such a device is good.  But that was a carefully laid twist that didn't confuse filmgoers and the director carefully gave you little snippets of the clues that led to the conclusion.  It's an easy to digest 'twist.'  It does not work in a film like Premonition, where the twists and turns contradict logic and further confuse filmgoers.

Premonition begins where Bullock plays a happily homebound housewife who has two children.  She takes the children to school, goes about her daily chores, listens to a voice message from her husband (where plot holes begin - I'll get to that later), and then receives the disturbing news that her husband is dead.  Next day, surprise, he's alive - it must have all been a dream because he's alive and it's a few days before the accident.  Next day (for Bullock's character anyway), it's the funeral, oh and there's a really unintentionally funny scene where she attempts to check out the casket!  Well it ends up being a lot of going back and forth and the filmakers allude that some of the things that occur must be real, but wait, if this was true, then that first day her daughter should've had scars..and didn't she end up going to a mental institution....does this sound confusing to you?  It's how the film operates.  And no - none of it makes sense.

Films dealing with time travel or telling the future in any sort of way must set up rules that the audience can follow - or at least let us in on any known incosistencies ala Back to the Future.  This film does neither and leaves the audience wondering ""huh?""  To further muddy the waters, this film has a number of unresolved subplots, including an aformenetioned scene involving her losing her children and getting commited and an alleged affair her husband may have been having.  As for the plot holes (Here be a spoiler), listen closely to the phone call from the husband in the beginning and hear it repeated towards the end.  Something's wrong.

This film is not recommended.  I swear I have never been more upset and infuriated after watching a movie.  I don't normally rant on films like this, but films of this low quality, robbed of any logic should be avoided.  If the film is recut into some Lifetime movie or even further into a twilight zone episode, it might have some value.  But 100 minutes could be used alot more wisely than watching this jumbled psychic/time travel boggle of a film.",1184803200,31,2811,4.613682092555332
2838809,2,B000QGDY06,"The latest in a string of Sandra Bullock mystery thrillers, Premonition is a jumbled mess of unexplained time travel and its consequent inconsistencies, and while not wholly lacking in entertainment value, does raise more questions than it answers - questions like ""Why is this happening to her again?"" and ""Why can't she change things?"" and possibly ""What made me watch this movie in the first place?""

Jokes aside, on first viewing of this latest addition to the time-traveling suspense film, one has to wonder about the numerous loose ends, plot holes, and disturbingly unsatisfactory resolution. I suppose the film didn't necessarily want the viewer to delve too deep into its mysteries, but the explanation ""some things can't be explained"" only works when the main plot doesn't depend on any reasons. Unfortunately Premonition does and we're left holding the bag - without knowing what's in it.

Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) appears to have the ideal family life - a loving husband, two beautiful daughters, and a brand new house. But one day after receiving a bizarre phone call from her husband Jim (Julian McMahon) she is informed by a police officer that he has died in a car accident. Distraught and in disbelief, Linda attempts to carry out the rest of her day normally, but eventually cries herself to sleep that night. She awakens the next morning to discover Jim is alive and well - it was all just a bad dream. Or was it? Each day she awakens to a new nightmare of inconsistencies traveling back and forth in time and must uncover the terrifying events that lead up to her husband's tragic demise.

The movie begins refreshingly enough with an adequate dose of confusion and disorientation as we learn of Linda's troubling plight. But soon it becomes apparent that the plot is in over its head and more disturbing than the events surrounding the protagonist is the inexplicable direction the film is heading. After each non-sequential day passes, more questions and inconsistencies are created - so many in fact that the audience will realize that there isn't sufficient time left in the two hour flick to resolve them all. So we are left with the inexcusable ""some things are unexplainable"" explanation which will likely cause more frustration than the inherent inevitability of Linda's predicament.

Premonition attempts to be ominous - and succeeds at times - but with several cheap scares and random events that don't add up, appreciation will be lost for the truly foreboding sequences. When the police officer that informs Linda of her husband's death appears on a different day, one might think a conspiracy is in the works, but no, it's just another random occurrence thrown in to add more confusion to an already convoluted premise. Whenever time travel is introduced in a story so are questions about the nature of altering the past, present, and future, but Premonition relies on the audience accepting its fixed rules without pondering their plausibility. Before there can be a ""who,"" ""what,"" or ""where,"" there needs to be a ""why,"" but you won't find one here. The film ends prematurely without divulging any reason for its ""premonition"" and therefore accepting the apparent inevitability of its conclusion and Linda's wanton disregard for trying to change the future and preserve her seemingly perfect life may be disappointingly difficult to swallow.

Though Bullock admirably tries to hold Mennan Yapo's thriller together, this Premonition becomes a little too much time travel and our belief can only be suspended so far before snapping from the weight of the impossibly unexplainable - it will leave you guessing until the very end, and unfortunately quite some time afterwards. While the film traverses seven days of one nightmarish week for Sandra, only about three of them made any sense, hence its score.

The premise draws upon `Dj Vu' and `Medium' with much of the atmosphere of  `The Sixth Sense'.  (There's even a shower scene where the seer comes upon her beloved.)  Can we change events of our loved ones if we can see in the future?  After watching this film I felt like I had been here before.  Despite some retread the movie has some redeeming values.

First of all `Premonition' does live up to its title.  The movie opens with Linda (Sandra Bullock) listening to her husband giving a phone message into their answering machine.  Shortly after she answers the door and is greeted by a police officer.  Somberly, the man tells her that her husband was in a serious car accident, and he didn't survive.  She is incredulous.  Not merely shock, but she understandably thinks it a mistake given the context of her husband's message.

From there we get fragmented events that make it seem like Linda is bumping into the future.  People she doesn't know address her and loved ones provide details she is oblivious about.  Meeting with her mother, who is a significant caretaker for her two children, she seems out of it, forlorned, bewildered.  Then, sleep becomes something of a portal, or maybe a change of consciousness.  When Linda awakes everything is back to normal.  Jim is alive, the children are fine, and the forbidding omens disappear.  Unlike many other films, the time frame gets shuffled, so she often loses track of what day it is and which events are meant to stay in sequence.

Added to her turmoil is the aspect of psychiatric care.  It gives us a sense of ambiguity done in movies like 'Donnie Darko' where we have to figure out what the true source of her problems in the story.  Many of those bumps in the future feature Linda being treated by Dr. Roth (Peter Stormare), a psychiatrist.  Besides sharing with her best friend Annie, she really confides her dilemma with him.  Obviously, not specializing in paranormal psychology, he gives her a prescription for lithium instead of an outlook of the future.

She also seeks advice from the parish priest.  He gives her good advice, but, then, Linda is on her own.  She must decide what to do with the future she's been presented.  Can she save her husband?  Do the visions give her some command of the future?

There are many aspects to admire in `Premonition'.  The movie does keep an up to date standard of edginess.  Even though it relies on music and editing more than most, and there`s one scene that uses a shaky pivoting camera to express the strife when Linda is confronting her family.  Sandra Bollock gives a fine performance as Linda.  Through her we can truly see Linda's grief and frustration.  On the other hand, some of the other omens don't fit in the story as well.  Perhaps disasters come in threes, but when Linda is startled by an explosion of a telephone wire, a crow is killed and lays before her.  It matches an event foreseen before, but it doesn't tell us much.  And that's how I left 'Premonition'.  Surely, most people won't be angry or overly disappointed after having watched this movie, but it leaves a lot of unanswered questions.

I believe the movie will appeal to the masses who are yearning for ""family values"" in their films.  The moviemakers' motives are admirable, but the execution of the story is so riddled with mysterious roadblocks that it made me feel like I had a long and cruel joke played on me.",1184803200,5,3500,4.662847790507365
2838811,5,B000QGDY06,"I really enjoyed this movie, and I like Sandra Bullock's movies anyway.  This movie was about a woman who has dreams about her husband's (upcoming?)death.  The dreams are in between dreams and reality.  It's like she is flipping around between 2 dimentions.  In one, he's dead.  In another, he's alive. They are chronological. They each seem so real. Some seem to be visions of things that COULD happen, IF things progress on a certain track.  As you expect, she goes through ""am I nuts?"" She tries to get help, but she is getting confused herself as to what is reality and others are not really able to help. Once she begins to track things on a calendar, she begins to get a handle on the situation.  Then she starts to ask herself IF this is going to happen, can I stop it?  Am I guilty of killing him if I don't? What the heck do I do?

I found it a very interesting movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought Sandra did a great job.  And the movie leaves you thinking. . . I also loved the ending.",1184803200,5,1002,4.281914893617022
2838812,1,B000QGDY06,Convoluted and completely unbelievable story resulting in an absolutely stupid movie with a poor ending.  Don't waste your time or money.,1184716800,10,137,5.523809523809524
2838813,3,B000QGDY06,"Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) has become unstuck in time.  Actually the time frame is one week in which the days have been shuffled.  She wakes up and it is Thursday, but the next day it is the previous Monday, and the day after that it is the following Saturday.  This is all confusing and quite maddening to Linda, especially since Thursday is the day the sheriff rings the doorbell and tells her that her husband had been killed in a car accident the day before.  That means when she wakes up on Monday Jim (Julian McMahon) is still alive, but on Saturday they are burying him.  Family and friends are starting to think that Linda is having mental problems, and she is having problems wrapping her mind around what is going on herself.  But if she knows what is going to happen, then she can do something about it, right?

This is one of Bullock's better performances as she takes advantage of the opportunity to do something different, but despite her best efforts this film lives and dies by the script by Bill Kelly (""Blast from the Past"").  The basic idea is pretty intriguing: Linda is living the days of this week out of sequence, which gives her the opportunity to do something about Jim's death.  The script even takes a nice twist when Linda starts thinking that maybe she should not do anything and just let it happen.  However, Kelly's script suffers from two fatal flaws, the first having to deal with Linda's ability to change things and the second with the way this twisted time travel tale plays out.

If you have not seen ""Premonition"" then you should look away at this point because THERE BE SPOILERS HERE and I am going to rant and rave about these reasons why I deducted two stars off of this 2007 film's rating.  If you have not seen the film and are interested in the premise and/or actress, then check it out sometime and then come back and read the rest of this review:

My rant is because Linda does not stop Bridgette from going through the plate glass door.  That happens on Tuesday and on Sunday Linda could put the damn flower stickers and save the door.  Bridgette did not have scars on Thursday, which was ""before"" Tuesday, but then she did not have them on Wednesday, which was ""after"" Tuesday.  Clearly Linda can do something about the past (which is where the future is usually found in this movie), and even if she does not want to do anything about Jim, she should want to spare Bridgette from getting her face all cut up.  I go back to the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" when Nancy wakes up and has yanked Freddy's hat back with her from her nightmare.  Nancy knows that this is important and figures out how she can make it work for her.  Linda is given a similar cosmic clue and she does absolutely nothing with it.  I thought preventing her daughter's accident would be the catalyst on Wednesday for Linda deciding to prevent the accident, but

My rave is that we get to the end of this film and it turns out that for all its complexity what with shuffling the days of the week and having Linda wrestle with whether or not she should prevent the accident, ""Premonition"" turns out to be such a variation on the old time traveling story that I have always related with the ""Titanic.""  You go back in time to stop the ""Titanic"" from hitting an iceberg, and while you are yelling, ""Look out for the iceberg!"" you distract the crew so they do not see the iceberg.  So Linda becomes the cause of Jim's death by trying to stop it.  Dramatic irony aside, the theoretical position here is that you cannot change the past because your attempt to change the past is already part of the past, so there.  The theological posturing at the end is too little too late, because I find it hard to believe that Linda would be able to live with what she has done.  Adding insult to injury is the alternate ending, which to me says they did not even have the courage of their conviction with the inadequate resolution of their intriguing premise.  At least the gag reel is about actually gags played on the set and not just flubbed lines, which was a nice touch, but not enough to redeem the flaws in this film.",1184716800,5,4136,4.450928381962865
2838814,1,B000QGDY06,"* SPOILER ALERT *

What is the point of having a 'time travel' type movie where you see the future, but then you do absolutely nothing to change the string of events?!? She sees her husbands death & he still dies exactly the way he is supposed to -- end of story.

That means the whole hook for this movie is that the events occur out of order ... whoopdedoo. The events could just have as easily been shown in order w/out all the flashbacks and flashforwards and you would wind up with the same result -- an enormous amount of suckitude.
