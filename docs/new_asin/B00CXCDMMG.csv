8587214,3,B00CXCDMMG,"It's okay-apparently there isn't a script for the actors and they were just winging it, and it shows. It was nice to see Judd Nelson be a nice guy for a change but Tanna Frederick is so over the top I almost couldn't make it through the movie. Minus a star for the chaos, minus a star for not having subtitles. Seriously? It's 2015. Subtitles should be mandatory.",1426204800,,363,4.352941176470588
8587215,2,B00CXCDMMG,"I've been watching Henry Jaglom's movies since 1984 (never missed a single one), loved them to the extent that I think most of them are masterpieces...but JUST 45 MINUTES FROM BROADWAY has got big problems, starting with the miscasting of Pandy.  The character's stories are seemingly deliberately phony, the acting is weirdly stylized, and--sadly--unlike the vast majority of Jaglom's films, there is no truth in this movie.  Henry, tell me that it ain't so!  For Jaglom's sake, skip this one.  Henry, give us THE TRUTH about life again!",1403308800,,538,5.079545454545454
8587216,4,B00CXCDMMG,Just 45 Minutes From Broadway has a roller coaster of a plot! The story changes frequently and constantly keeps your attention throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and found it very easy to become sucked into the storyline and each of the characters' lives. A must see in my point of view!,1374624000,,295,4.6923076923076925
