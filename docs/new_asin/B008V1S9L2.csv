8530760,5,B008V1S9L2,"Virginia Broitman has created a wonderful series of clicker training DVDs.  The ""Bow Wow"" series will give you a clear example of perfect timing, how to shape behaviors and build behavior chains and put them reliably on cue.  Teach some useful as well as fun behaviors to your dog - or any animal!  These videos are a MUST HAVE for your dog training library! It's hard to choose, but I think the How of Bow Wow is my favorite. - Carol Byrnes, CPDT-KA",1355011200,4,450,4.397590361445783
