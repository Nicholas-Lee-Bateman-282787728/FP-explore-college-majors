2636684,4,B000HEWHJ6,If your looking for a different movie and different storyline that will keep your interest. This is it.,1204588800,,103,4.777777777777778
2636685,4,B000HEWHJ6,"Despite the fact Devil Times Five (1974) aka The Horrible House on the Hill aka People Toys is an extremely inexpensive, independent feature comprised of footage shot during two, obviously separate shoots, and one that suffers from core issues, I still found it an ookie and entertaining nugget of exploitive horror that depicts what happens when five, young, homicidal sociopaths are accidentally released upon an unsuspecting public.  Directed by Sean MacGregor (Gentle Savage), with additional scenes supplied by David Sheldon (Grizzly), the film features Taylor Lacher (Mr. Majestyk), Joan McCall (Grizzly), Carolyn Stellar (Cry Blood, Apache), and Gene Evans (Donovan's Brain).  Also appearing is Sorrell `Boss Hogg' Booke (""The Dukes of Hazzard""), Shelley Morrison (""Will & Grace""), John Durren (The Gumball Rally), Gail Smale, Dawn `Dodie' Lyn (""My Three Sons""), Tierre Turner (Cornbread, Earl and Me), Tia Thompson, and 1970s child star Leif Garrett (Walking Tall Part II).

As the film opens we witness a number of things, the most substantial involving a boogie van with some children and a couple of adults careening off a snowy, California mountain road (the five children survive, while the adults, seemingly, aren't so lucky).  After the accident the children wander through the snow and come upon a very large, isolated house owned by a self-made blowhard named Papa Doc (Evans), who happens to be vacationing with some family and business acquaintances.  In attendance is Papa Doc's daughter Julie (McCall), her hair impaired boyfriend Rick (Lacher), Papa Doc's sleazy trophy wife Lovely (Stellar), who's actually Julie's stepmother, Papa Doc's sycophant Harvey Beckman (Booke), Harvey's boozy wife Ruth (Morrison), and a mentally defective man-child caretaker named Ralph (Durren), who comes off exactly like the character of Lennie from John Steinbeck's novel ""Of Mice and Men"", even to the point where he takes care of some rabbits (I wouldn't have been surprised if he named one of them George).  As far as the children go, there's creepy eyed Sister Hannah (Smale), who's the oldest, claims to be a novice nun, and acts somewhat as the leader, a black kid named Brian (Turner) who's apparently obsessed with the military (he even wears fatigues), Susan (Thompson), the resident pyromaniac, David (Garrett), a habitual liar with cross-dressing tendencies, and the youngest a little girl named Moe (Lyn), who's apparently a non-descript sort of nutty.  Anyway, shortly after the seemingly harmless children are taken in various things start to happen like the phone going dead, the generator supplying the electricity going kaput, the rifles and kitchen cutlery going missing, along with an `accidental' death.  The adults, being incredibly slow on the uptake, don't suspect the children at first, but soon realize the error of their ways once the homicide rate begins to rise...

One should probably know going into this film the first hour or so moves along very slowly, mostly because there's a lot of material involving the adults that doesn't really add anything to the actual plot.  The last twenty minutes or so things do pick up, once the little weirdoes start seriously offing the adults.  There was one painfully tedious sequence upfront and that involved an adult who actually survived the van accident following the children in an effort to keep them from committing harming others, as he obviously knew the danger should they come into contact with `normal' people.  The children realize he's following them and set up a murderous ambush.  The vicious attack scene, which was shot in slow motion and sepia tones, lasts a staggering six minutes (this may not seem like a lot but in movie time it's a huge chunk).  As far as the story the main problem I had was with the children, specifically how they were able to easily deceive the adults for as long as they did.  The children weren't a highly organized collective, especially given their willingness to argue amongst themselves, but they continually managed to outmaneuver the clueless adults at every turn.  I would think some major red flags would have gone up once the phone went dead, the power was killed, the car disabled, and all the rifles and knives disappeared, but whatever...if you can get past this element, the film is actually pretty creepy, especially given the means in which the children dispatched some of their elders (hammers, sickles, axes, spears, guns, piranha, immolation, etc.).  The funniest bit for me in the film, besides seeing a young Leif Garrett donning a wig, makeup, and a dress (his character was one of the creepiest of the little weirdoes), was when Harvey Beckman tries to score with his souse of a wife Ruth, who obviously lost interest in that kind of thing long ago, resulting in the following exchange...

Ruth: Harvey, I have a headache, a toothache, a backache, and I'm expecting the gout.

Harvey: (frustrated) Would an aspirin help?

As I said the story does tend to move along slowly, but I thought the characters were fairly interesting so it wasn't a huge deal for me.  Along with some violence (none of it terribly gory), there's also a small bit of skin from both Joan McCall and Carolyn Stellar.  All in all the film did have some problems, but the performances were fairly solid (for an independently made, exploitative horror film) and the nastiness, once in full swing, was pretty entertaining making it worthy of a look for anyone interested in creepy, somewhat forgotten horror features from the 1970s.

The picture on the DVD, released by Code Red and distributed by Media Blasters, is presented in widescreen anamorphic (1.78:1), and looks decent considering the age of the film and the independent nature of the production.  There is the occasional flaw, but nothing too obtrusive, usually limited to a small scratch or some other, minor marking.  The audio, available in Dolby Digital 2.0, is definitely on the soft side, but otherwise decent enough.  There are a slew of complimentary extras including a short, alternate main sequence, a poster gallery, an original theatrical trailer, interviews with the cast and crew, and an audio commentary track featuring actors Joan McCall, Dawn Lyn, producer Mickey Blowitz, and co-director David Sheldon, moderated by film historian Darren Gross (the original director, Sean MacGregor, is noticeably absent).  Also included are previews for Don't Go in the Woods (1982), Love Me Deadly (1973), School Girls in Chains (1973), Sweet Sixteen (1983), Beyond the Door (1974), and The Secrets of Sweet Sixteen (1973).

2636686,4,B000HEWHJ6,"This is one of my pet favorite films and frankly I was surprised to learn that an actual DVD release was in the works. DEVIL TIMES FIVE is another one of those long lost home video era cult favorites due to what poor taste the film seems to revel in. People often sneer when reading the premise of the film -- especially at the presence of cultural punching bag Leif Garrett -- but once you have seen it you cannot help but be somewhat charmed by it's wickedness.

THE PLOT: Five little psychopathic monsters en-route to a state run mental hospital for the criminally insane survive a horrifying bus accident in the California mountains. The tykes make their way across the frozen winter countryside and take up residence in a resort home owned by a local hospital magnate. They then proceed to terrorize, torture and murder the six adults on-hand in a single minded game to collect ""People Toys"" for a life sized playset up in the loft bungalow of the chalet's caretaker. Creepy, innapropriately entertaining and surprisingly well made, this is a highly recommended shocker for fans of low budget 1970s American horror.

Code Red's DVD is made from a brand new direct to digital transfer from the original negatives, and for anyone who is used to the somewhat murky fullframe VHS prints will be a revelation during some of the darker passages: You can pretty much see everything now. While I am not a big fan of the digital coloring process used to simulate the DeLuxe color process used (including light-through projection: it just doesn't look the same, ever) and am concerned that the LBX cropping to 1:78:1 (anamorphic, 16x9) may have resulted in some loss of information at the top and bottom, it's still a fabulous little DVD version that should suit fans well, and hopefully make some new ones.

The content of the film is about the same as what we know from the older VHS releases, with added bonus features of a theatrical trailer, an alternate opening sequence, and a photo gallery of advertisement art. There are also interview segments featuring some of the original participants and an optional commentary track as well. It's too bad that Leif Garrett -- who could probably have used the money -- was not able to participate due to scheduling conflicts beyond his ability to control (re: prison). Stay in school, kids.

Overall I give the DVD a 4/5. It's worth the money, and those old Media Ent. video tapes still have life yet, with the correct color and the original open matte 4:3 transfer. Some things in life are worth holding onto.",1164412800,23,2552,4.740990990990991

2636700,3,B000HEWHJ6,"Out in the California wilderness, a nun and four children from a mental institution, emerge from a horrific vehicular accident, and are taken in by a group staying at a remote mansion.  Surrounded by snow, the adults are focused on their own personal dramas, and have no clue that they have taken in a group of sociopathic killers, in Devil Times Five (aka Peopletoys, and The House on Horrible Hill (1974)), a film that slowly transforms from a kind of routine drama, to a bloody thriller, as the creepy kids begin to do their thing.  While not a great film, with some nasty kills, and young minors actively engaged in macabre acts, this twisted tale may be of interest to horror buffs, looking for a bloodbath.

The cast has a family connection, as future teen idol Leif Garrett, and his sister Dawn Lyn (Dodie, on My Three Sons) play two of the killer kids, with the siblings real mother Carolyn Stellar, also appearing in the film, and becoming the victim of a vicious animal attack.

The acting isn't very compelling, and the storytelling is often clumsy, but the plot ventures to some unexpected places, and features sudden violence, and sick behavior that seems edgy for 1974.  Definitely not suitable for family viewing, the bloody third act makes this 2.5 star effort, a mild recommendation to horror fans, particularly while it is available to Prime members.",1377993600,,1368,4.804255319148936

This as others have stated is a ""so bad it's good"" type of movie. The deaths are rather unique although unconvincing. It's hilarious how these kids can get away with what they do and there lies the appeal in it.

I'll give it credit, it's a rather different plot and movie than those other horror flicks. It does have the usual formula of other flicks. Many of the characters are unlikable and you don't feel too bad when they meet their end. Leif Garrett is pretty funny as one of the evil brats.",1250553600,,637,4.256198347107438

2636731,3,B000HEWHJ6,"""Devil Times Five"" must have been one of those ""rare gems"" shown in grindhouse theatres in the early seventies.  It is low budget, amoral cinema meant to shock and repulse, which it does in several creative death scenes.  However, the acting is mediocre, and the plot is bogged down with unnecessary promiscuity.  I especially detested the deplorable scene where a rich man's bored trophy wife attempts to sexually seduce a mentally challenged handyman.  Perhaps all of the adults are somewhat mentally challenged.  It's difficult to believe that they didn't realize the bizarre, perverted kids who are literally found on their living room floor are responsible for the strange events surrounding them.  When you are snowbound in a secluded mansion, who else could it be but the strangers?

  I am tempted to give this movie two stars but am giving it three because of the imaginative, gruesome death scenes, especially the one involving the Piranhas attacking someone in the bathtub.

  If you enjoy watching movies about children killing adults, then buy or rent ""Who Can Kill A Child?""  Directed by Ibanez Narcisco Serrador, this movie involves a young British couple who find themselves on a Spanish island where the children have killed all of the adults.  It predates ""Children of the Corn"" by several years and is much better.

  I plan to trade ""Devil Times Five"" faster than you can say ""Devil"" five times.",1218412800,2,1415,5.0042918454935625
2636732,4,B000HEWHJ6,"I feel compelled to write something positive about this DVD release and the company Code Red. Sorry, but the other two reviews on this page are very unkind to this stylish, well acted, accomplished cinematography and very creepy tale. Code Red deserve your support if you are a horror fan, and no I don't work for them, but they are a very small outfit struggling against the big companies. Devil Times Five along with Sole Survivor should be seen by anyone who calls themselves a horror film fan.
So I say 3 stars for the movie and 4 stars for the DVD which has surprising amount of extras, and the box art is great too.

This flick is SLOW! Not much happens until the last 15 minutes or so-- and I had long since lost interest in the annoying characters. Awful acting, horrible dialogue. No suspense.

2636734,4,B000HEWHJ6,"Here is a story of five stark raving mad children while on their way to a mental institute their bus crashes in the snowy mountains. The unaware three couples awaiting in a cabin that they thought was a vacation, have no idea what their in for when the satanic kids arrive. Of course the couples take in the ever so innocent little ones, and become the victims of a unknown evil.

 Although the story starts out very slow, and the adult characters in the movie are over the top ignorant, and quite bad at acting, the children well make up for them in this film. They have a certain way of drawing the audience in, and scaring anyone who watches. You never find out why they are so crazy, which I guess is suppose to be meant for you to use your own imagination. It takes about an hour for anything really bad to happen, except for the killing of the mental institute employee. Once the brutal killings start they never let up. There are some unforgettable murder scenes,(like piranha's in the bathtub) that will leave you feeling like maybe you could pass on the idea of ever giving birth to demented little kids like these.

 Even though Devil Times Five is not quite up there with movies like The Exorcist or Who Can Kill A Child, it still deserves to be in the horror collection. When evil corrupts innocence it becomes very scary indeed. Never underestimate the evil of a child or five. I recommend this for anyone who likes cult movies with children playing the villians. Is also a very low budget film.",1209859200,10,1508,4.472727272727273
8139290,4,B000HEWHJ6,"Devil Times 5 was originally known as Peopletoys which became The Horrible House on the Hill before finally settling on the more common title. Im not sure if you can actually find it under either early titles these days.

It's a disturbing movie, but then evil children movies often are.  Its troubled history causes it to range from so bad its amusing to genuinely good, but either way it ultimately accomplishes what it wants to do which is to create an atmosphere of disturbing tension.

A van carrying 5 kids to a mental institution crashes in the mountains freeing the young prisoners.  They make their way to a secluded mountain resort where a group of people are enjoying (or enduring depending on the perspective) a sort of work vacation.  The kids begin playing with the minds of the adults and murdering them one by one.

The concept itself is disturbing since we generally think of kids as innocent or at least not fully aware of the capacity of mankind to do evil deeds.  These youngsters are more like demonic imps  so disturbed that murder and playing with corpses is their idea of fun.

I didn't expect much out of the performances of the kids.  While they aren't perfect by any means they are better than I thought they would be.  I found the girl pretending to be a nun particularly chilling.  She has a stoicism mixed with an angelic beauty that masks the evil within.  However, all of the kids do a commendable job with their roles. Some have gone on to do other notable work.

In general the cast isn't made up of the unknowns Im used to in these obscure slasher flicks. While Im not very familiar with most of them (the primary exception being Sorrell Booke AKA Boss Hogg) nearly all of them have a respectable list of credits. Many of the performances are quite good and offset the kids and each other surprisingly well.

The characters cover a number of distinct and contrasting personas.  We've got a happy couple against an unhappy one.  There's one with an overabundance of self-confidence and one with none at all.  We've got the faithful and the unfaithful, the drunkard and the more self-controlled.  The interactions between all the different types work well, and their various reactions to the kids are played out in believable fashion (more or less).

Not everything is top-notch though (or even mid-notch, for that matter).  The staging of most of the murders is unconvincing to begin with, but the editing and effects added to some of them makes them worse. The first murder in particular drags on and on in slow-mo with the color changed to an unneeded black-and-white or sepia (depending on the transfer you get). Its the slowed down audio that tips the scene from offbeat to annoying for me and even then primarily because it goes on for so long.

The original director filmed a movie that was unwatchable leading to vast rewrites and the filming of additional scenes. This results in a number of inconsistencies. Youll enjoy this movie more if you don't pay too much attention to those kinds of details.

It has some music in the soundtrack that is stereotypical 70's.  It's dated, but I found it kind of fun.  It's appropriately used at least.  There's no disco when people are being strangled, or that sort of thing.

I've recently learned that this film was part of the inspiration for one of my 2013 favorites, Sinister. Devil Times 5 came to mind as I watched it even before knowing the link so there are definite similarities. If you like the Scott Derrickson chiller you'll probably enjoy this one and vice-versa.

Content:
Its a violent slasher with nudity, sex, and strong language. Its bleak and disturbing. A preview trailer on the Code Red DVD borders on softcore porn.

DVD:
I first saw it in the Chilling Classics 50 mega-pack.  The audio is slightly distorted but mostly OK.  The video is clear enough to be watchable but often too dark.  A Mill Creek logo pops up here and there like an evil imp bent on your destruction.  (Few if any other movies in this set have the watermark though its a problem in some other Mill Creek sets.) Why would I want to know the DVD company in the middle of the movie? There are no extras.

I also got Code Reds DVD. Its a vast improvement. It uses the original title card but is still marketed under the more common title. Nothing other than the title card is different as far as the editing goes.
The video is 1.78 anamorphic widescreen and far cleaner than the other print. Its still not a good looking movie with trash, lots of grain, and a dark edge along the left side occasionally. Colors are not all that vibrant, but I didn't expect high technical quality: good enough to enjoy the movie is all I really wanted, and Code Red delivers.
The audio is 2.0 Dolby. Its not as drastic an improvement as the video is but is still noticeably cleaner and sharper than the other transfer.

Extras include an informative commentary, over 20 minutes of interesting interviews, a small poster gallery, an alternate title sequence, and a trailer (Ill provide a more precise list below). There is a good bit of info on the conflicts with the original director in the commentary and interviews.

American Pop Classic has an edition that is said to be digitally remastered, but that doesnt always mean significantly improved quality. There are a few other options though none promise anything worth getting excited about.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
Devil Times 5 is a good, disturbing, B movie thriller if you can deal with the creepy kids. It's campy and imperfect but effective in its own way with a strong cast and interesting characters. I was originally going to give it 3*, but I found myself enjoying the improved Code Red presentation enough that Im bumping that up a notch (a worthy upgrade from my crappy Chilling Classics print). Its not a movie for everyone, but it might just be my favorite 70s era slasher flick thanks in no small part to the rather twisted ending. Im pleased with the Code Red DVD and recommend it both for the better quality and for its extras. Im not convinced that any other edition available will offer what this one does so you're probably best served going as cheap as possible otherwise.

Code Red DVD Extras:
-Commentary: Joan McCall, Dawn Lyn, producer, co-director, film historian: They have a lot of interesting info about this troubled production. They offer tidbits about who the various actors are, who Dylan Jones is and the problems with the director, why there is missing information, how you can tell the reshoot footage, confusion on set, Sorrell Booke behind the scenes, disguising Sister Hannahs real age, the title changes, and the original idea for a sequel-producing movie.

-Poster Gallery (0:35) This is an automated slideshow using chapter skips as manual controls. It includes posters and what looks like VHS boxes. The images are rather small but good enough to read the text. The DVD stops playback after the feature ends.

-Alternate Main Title Sequence (0:13) This is simply the Devil Times Five title card (the movie itself uses the earlier title).

-Original Trailer (2:15) There is no way to survive the Devil x 5.

-Interviews (21:59) The producer, co-writer/co-director, Joan McCall, Dawn Lyn, and Tierre Turner reminisce about the movie. We get to see what some of the kids looks like as adults. They talk about the trouble with the director and what had to happen to make the movie full length, the original concept of the story, thoughts on and stories about most of the actors, an incident involving piranha, and aspirations for a sequel.

-Previews: 6 set up like a chapter selection menu. Content warning: some bloody violence, sex, nudity, and molestation (the last one is just shy of porn).",1526342400,,7782,4.763961280714818

This flick is SLOW! Not much happens until the last 15 minutes or so-- and I had long since lost interest in the annoying characters. Awful acting, horrible dialogue. No suspense. Don't expect much, but somewhat fun because it's so bad.",1390780800,,482,4.616279069767442
8139297,2,B000HEWHJ6,It was a bit dated. Acting way below average. But the piranhas in the bath tub scene almost made it worth watching.,1387497600,,115,4.2727272727272725
8139298,2,B000HEWHJ6,"I had hoped it was more of a ""The Children"" feel to it, but it was predictable and typical of the American low budget horror films of the era. I had high hopes for this film but it did not deliver.",1382486400,,197,3.8292682926829267
8139299,2,B000HEWHJ6,"This was just a silly movie and there are plenty of others that are better.
I don't recommend you waste your time watching it.",1381449600,,126,4.291666666666667
