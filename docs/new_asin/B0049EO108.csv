4287737,5,B0049EO108,"""The Town"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Doug MacRay is an unrepentant criminal, the de facto leader of a group of ruthless bank robbers who pride themselves in stealing what they want and getting out clean. With no real attachments, Doug never has to fear losing anyone close to him. But that all changed on the gang's latest job, when they briefly took a hostage--bank manager, Claire Keesey. Though they let her go unharmed, Claire is nervously aware that the robbers know her name and where she lives. But she lets her guard down when she meets an unassuming and rather charming man named Doug not realizing that he is the same man who only days earlier had terrorized her. The instant attraction between them gradually turns into a passionate romance that threatens to take them both down a dangerous, and potentially deadly, path.

The cast led by Ben Affleck (who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay) (in an excellent performance as Doug MacRay), Rebecca Hall (as Claire Keesey), Jon Hamm (as Frawley), Jeremy Renner (as Jem), Blake Lively (as Krista), Pete Postlethwaite (as Fergie) & Chris Cooper (as Stephen MacRay) is excellent! The directing by Affleck (who also directed & co-wrote the screenplay to ""Gone Baby Gone"" (2007) is excellent! The screenplay (based on Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince Of Thieves"") by Affleck, Aaron Stockard (who also co-wrote the screenplay to ""Gone Baby Gone"", also an associate producer) & Peter Craig is excellent!

The music by Harry Gregson-Williams (who also did the music to ""Gone Baby Gone"", ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009), ""The Taking Of Pelham 1 2 3"" (2009), ""The Shrek movies"" (2001, 2004, 2007 & 2010), ""Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time"" (2010) & the upcoming ""Unstoppable"" (2010) & David Buckley (who also did the music to ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" (2008) & ""From Paris With Love"" (2010) is excellent! The cinematography by Robert Elswit (who also did the cinematography to ""Michael Clayton"" (2007), ""There Will Be Blood"" (2007), ""Redbelt"" (2008), ""Duplicity"" (2009), ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" (2009), ""Salt"" (2010) & the upcoming ""Mission: Impossible IV"" (2011) is excellent! The film editing by Dylan Tichenor (who also did the film editing to ""Boogie Nights"" (1997), ""Magnolia"" (1999), ""Unbreakable"" (2000), ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" (2001), ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005), ""The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford"" (2007), ""There Will Be Blood"" & ""Doubt"" (2008) is excellent! The casting by Lora Kennedy (who also did the casting to ""Tombstone"" (1993), ""The Boondock Saints"" (1999), ""Swordfish"" (2001), ""Syriana"" (2005) & the upcoming ""Sucker Punch"" (2011) is excellent! The production design by Sharon Seymour (who also did the production design to ""Bad Santa"" (2003), ""Friday Night Lights"" (2004), ""Gone Baby Gone"" & ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"") is excellent! The art direction by Peter Borck (who also did the art direction to ""Bad Santa"", ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Freedom Writers"" (2007) & ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"") is excellent! The set decoration by Maggie Martin (who also did the set decoration to ""Ladder 49"" (2004), ""Red Eye"" (2005) & ""My Sister's Keeper"" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Susan Matheson (who also did the costume design to ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby"" (2006), ""The Kingdom"" (2007), ""Step Brothers"" (2008), ""Couples Retreat"" (2009) & the upcoming ""Fright Night"" (2011) is excellent!

This is a brilliant film that is well-made and well-acted by its cast & director. Ben Affleck's follow-up to his debut with ""Gone Baby Gone"" is brilliant. This is one of the best movies of the year, so far, and it also looks like to be an Oscar contender, as well. This is a little bit better than ""Gone Baby Gone"".",1284768000,,3771,5.069243156199678
4287738,5,B0049EO108,"The first of the 2000s were not kind to Ben Affleck.  After emerging as an actor with some promise in the late 1990s, including an Academy Award for screenwriting, the new Millenium offered up a series of disappointments:  bad or mediocre role choices, the tabloid media spectacle of ""Bennifer"", and ultimately massive overexposure leading to his becoming a punchline (best friend Matt Damon, meanwhile, only kept getting bigger).  I was one of those who thought he had little to offer by mid-decade.  But at that point, he started to turn things around professionally, as an actor and, with the release in 2007 of the brilliant ""Gone Baby, Gone"", as a director.  With ""The Town"", his second feature as a director, he proves that it wasn't just a flash in the pan.  Spoilers follow.

Based on the novel ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan, the setup and a lot of the story here is rather familiar:  Our protagonist is a criminal, born into a life of crime, and is discontentedly looking for a way out of a world that offers nothing but dead ends, but feels bound alternately by threats and his close family ties.  In this case, our main character is Doug McRay (Affleck himself; his brother Casey was busy making a fake documentary about Joaquin Phoenix), the leader of a four-person bank-robbing crew that includes his best friend Jem (""The Hurt Locker""'s Jeremy Renner) and two other disposable guys.  They pull heists for Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite), an old-timer who worked with their fathers.  Jem's sister Krista (Blake Lively) is Doug's sometime squeeze, and would like to be more, but Doug is more interested in Claire (Rebecca Hall, again taking her fake American accent out for a spin), the manager of a bank that the boys rob.  And FBI special agent Adam Frawley (""Mad Men""'s Jon Hamm) is on the McRay crew's case.

The close-knit ethnic crime ring (Irish, in this case; the last decade has seen a burgeoning subgenre of Boston Irish crime films to counter the traditional supremacy of New York Italians) where loyalty is everything is a film staple, as is the criminal lured toward the good side by the prospect of a good relationship.  But originality isn't everything (there are only so many truly original stories, after all), particularly when you execute your story as well as Affleck does here.  While the film isn't as emotional or dark as ""Gone Baby, Gone"", every shot and decision is confidently made; the cast and crew know what they're doing, and Affleck delivers some tense gun battles and car chases, two cinematic staples that under many directors come across as quite rote.  And Affleck the screenwriter (and the novel it's based on) smartly strike a balance between the redemptive and the realistic in crafting the ending - it is nice, incidentally, to see a crime film aimed at adults that doesn't subscribe to the idea that a completely bleak ending is the only 'realistic' option.

The performances are all up to the material.  Affleck the director and screenwriter gives Affleck the actor everything necessary to bring a well-realized character to the screen.  Jeremy Renner is a real livewire, and easily steals the show as Jem, who is easily led to violence but whose hair-trigger is not quite so fine as many movie psychos (refreshing; you wonder why anyone would ever keep Joe Pesci around in most of his movies).  Jon Hamm, so brilliant on ""Mad Men"", takes the standard role of the dogged cop and makes it work (Frawley is the straight arrow that Don Draper only resembles).  Among the women, both Hall and Lively do well; Lively's work here should definitely earn her some credibility as an actress, while Hall continues her series of fine performances (one is constantly waiting for her to get a real breakthrough role).  Postlethwaite and Chris Cooper (as Doug's father) have good cameo roles.

Recommended.",1284768000,,3846,4.865030674846626
4287739,5,B0049EO108,"I've wanted to see The Town ever since I saw the first previews of it. First, the story seemed quite intriguing: what happens if a man falls in love with the woman he anonymously took hostage while robbing a bank? Another thing that made me want to see this film is that, unlike many crime dramas, this one seemed to escape the artificially polished Hollywood-ish feel. I had to see it.

...And I was correct on all counts! The Town, which was co-written, directed, and features by Ben Affleck, was every bit of what I thought it would be. The directing was very ""real"" feeling (especially capturing the working-class feel of Charlestown, MA very well). The script was quite good, not once seeming over-the-top or under-developed. The cast and acting was very good.

But I reserve a separate paragraph for talking about the plot and its execution. This film is somewhere between a crime thriller, a character study, and a romance. It has enough teeth to excite those who like car chases and heists but enough depth of emotion to satisfy those who want strong characters and plot lines. The story revolves around Doug McRay, who robs banks with his friends from Charlestown. On one heist (the movie opener), they deviate from the plan and take a hostage. After letting her go (she never saw them), Doug decides to follow her and talk with her. They end up starting a relationship. The questions: how can Doug keep this secret, and how can he get out of his life of crime?

The plot's execution was very well done: fast enough, slow enough. By the end, you have really identified with Doug McRay and may end up feeling as conflicted as he.

For its great story line, believable direction, and its originality, I give The Town 5 stars and recommend it highly to you.",1284768000,61,1763,4.641025641025641
4287740,5,B0049EO108,"Hard boiled bank heist movie, that's here. Bad guy wants to change, that's here too. Great acting. Even with actors in only a single scene, stick in the memory. Chris Cooper in red, devil or victim? Great action without the computer trash. Chase scenes in Boston's North End that could happen, and that bridge is right there, so it doesn't insult people that know. But above all, Ben creates a film that treats the actors and material well. The crowd at the theatre loved it. Charlestown looks great. Lehane's got a new book coming, let's hope Ben gets a chance at it.",1284768000,5,568,4.578431372549019
4287741,5,B0049EO108,"Until a few years ago Ben Affleck definitly had his ups and downs. Whether it be in tabloids or mediocre movies he never seemed to be making a positive impact on film (though I'll admit to being one of the only people who liked Daredevil). Then a few years ago he gave a fantastic performance in 'Hollywood Land' and wrote and directed the entertaining and thought-provoking crime thriller 'Gone Baby Gone'. 'The Town' (in my opinion) is not only his best film as both director and actor, it's one of the most entertaining and engaging crime films I've ever seen!

The plot of 'The Town' is pretty bare bones: Armed Robbers from Charlestown (a suburb of Boston, MA with a violent reputation) steal from a bank and take a bank teller (Rebecca Hall) hostage. After letting her go, their leader Doug (Affleck) trails her to find out what she knows about them and at the same time starts a relationship with her. There's also an FBI agent (Jon Hamm) on their trail. While this is pretty much the plot of the story it's what we learn about each character and how growing up and living in Charlestown has effected their lives. I read Charles Hogan's novel 'Prince of Thieves' (which this film is based) a while ago but as good as it was it never gripped you the way this film does.

The directing in 'The Town' is masterful. The heist scenes are exciting and never too drawn out and the action is very level-headed without losing the excitement. To add to this and some great character interaction scenes Affleck uses real locations to add to the authentic feel of the setting. Our protagonist visits community centers and meetings that add a flavor to 'The Town' other Boston-based films like 'The Departed' and 'Mystic River' were lacking.

The casting and acting couldn't be better and fits the movie perfectly. Ben Affleck creates a memorable and sympathetic protagonist in Doug, even as we see him do some violent things. Rebecca Hall is both intelligent and strong as Claire the Bank teller who falls for Doug. Jeremy Renner is dynamite as Jem, Doug's life-long friend who's a loose cannon but is a fully fleshed out character. Jon Hamm sheds his 'Mad Men' image and creates an FBI agent who's just as ruthless and tough as the criminals he's after. Chris Cooper has a brief but memorable role as Doug's father. Blake Lively, Pete Postlethwaite, and Titus Welliver also contribute strong performances.

The extended version of The Town is about 30 minutes longer has a few fun scenes with Jem and Doug, and draws out Claire and Doug's relationship. There's also a bit more about Jon Hamm and Blake Lively's characters and it extends some of the montages. None of these scenes seemed drastically necessary (most of them are in the first half of the film) but fans will definitely appreciate some of the more drawn out exposition.

I really can't praise this movie enough. Ben Affleck created one of the most authentic-feeling crime films with 'Gone Baby Gone' but he has not only topped that but managed to make 'The Town' as entertaining as it is an inside look at a community with a violent reputation. You may feel like you've seen this story before but rarely has it been told this well.",1284681600,2,3190,4.679144385026738

4287743,2,B0049EO108,"Maybe I'm just getting wise to Ben Afflecks poor acting, but the story line in this movie seemed choppy. It didn't flow.

And spoilers ahead.......

The lady who gets held hostage at the beginning, who is super pissed to find out that the robber didn't tell her who he was, decides to help him get off the hook and accept a ton of stolen money? Sorry, didn't buy it. They show Ben Affleck the bank robber for about 3 seconds looking out at some beautiful scenery at the end. It just felt lazy at that point.",1524787200,,560,4.273584905660377

I stayed away from this movie when it first came out, the critics damning it with faint praise. I guess they were too busy wetting themselves over the unpleasant misanthropic work of C. Nolan
But even the first time I saw a butchered version of it on cable, I knew this was a classic.
Its one of those flicks you can watch again and again, kudos to Affleck on both directing and acting in this movie.
My beef is with the ""special"" edition I though I was gonna get.
This was supposed to be a two-disc release, extended version, in both DVD and Blu-Ray.
Well, not quite........
This is one of those extra-greedy Hollywood wank jobs.
The DVD in NOT AN EXTENDED VERSION and worse, its some kind of ""digital copy"" that's only good till Dec. 2011, too bad it's 2018 when I bought it.
Worried about even putting it in my DVD player, will it smoke and explode like something from Mission Impossible?  you know like after they listen to their mission......
so not quite a two-disc version and not quite ""special"", and feeling a little burned about it.
Still a great flick, see it if you haven't it and if you have , then pick the extended version.... available only on
Blu-Ray.",1521158400,2,1260,4.5506607929515415

Usually in a movie, you get emotionally attached the protagonist, then if something bad happens to them - you feel bad.  This movie is just a violent story, with minor attachment to the female protagonist, but not Ben Affleck.  I love to stream movies and TV shows on Amazon.  I find less and less new TV shows and movies are NOT included in Amazon Prime.  Luckily, I don't pay for Amazon prime for the streaming, but for the shipping and purchasing benefits.  I have a Kindle Fire as well, and often download movies and such onto my Kindle for travel.  Past that, most of my Amazon Video watching is streaming either on my TiVo or my Roku.  I have looked into getting the Fire TV, but its more expensive than the Roku and cant find anything it does better than my Roku.

4288200,4,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck paces this thriller nicely and has a good eye for the Boston streets.  I liked this better than ""Gone, Baby, Gone,"" his earlier effort.  It's the story of Doug MacRay (Affleck), a young (mid-30s) bank robber from the Charlestown section of Boston, who runs a small operation and reports to Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite, in maybe his last performance), who fronts as a florist while in effect running Doug and his pals.  Doug wants out of the life, especially after he falls for Claire (Rebecca Hall), the bank manager of a bank that the gang has hit in Skeletor disguise, and he doesn't want to end up like his dad (Chris Cooper), who is serving a long jail sentence.  What makes an escape from the life difficult are (a) the hold that Fergie has over him when he finds out about Claire, and (b) his ties to Jem (Jeremy Renner), who claims he served nine years for killing someone to protect Doug, though it becomes clear that Doug never asked for protection and that Jem is a crazily violent man who enjoys hurting and killing -- but he's also the brother of Doug's former girlfriend (Blake Lively), who seems now to be addicted to cocaine and booze.  The cops have their eyes on Doug's gang's doings -- Frawley (John Hamm) and Dino (Titus Welliver) are the cops, and with some good procedural work, they tie Doug's gang to one of the robberies and go after them.  They also soon notice that Doug is connected to Claire -- who has no idea that Doug was involved in the robbery of her bank -- and it's not long before they are using her to tie it all up.  Meanwhile Doug is prodded by Fergie into a big heist at Fenway Park . . .  and that's all I'll say, in order to avoid spoilers.

Doug's reluctance to continue in the life is tied to a backstory that is very well integrated into the main action -- nice work by Affleck there too, as co-writer as well as director.  Doug's visit to his father in jail is one of the most effective scenes, and we realize that Doug is seeking an escape from a traumatic past that an older generation -- Fergie and his dad -- makes both psychologically and logistically difficult for him.  Chris Cooper is a great actor, and we don't see a lot of him here -- one ""cameo scene -- but, like Fergie, he's chilling.  Also very effective is Jeremy Renner as the crazily violent Jem.  Affleck and Hamm are obviously comfortable on screen, but both are rather inexpressive facially and vocally.  Still, given that Affleck is playing a guarded and rather depressed character, these limitations are not damaging.  The young women -- Hall and Lively -- do good work.  There's a nice sentimental undertow to the whole project that makes the ending satisfying without being cloying, and that has been set up by the gradual revelations about Doug's past -- including much that Doug himself didn't know.  Good stuff -- a very solid piece of work.",1464393600,,2876,4.510597302504817
4288201,3,B0049EO108,"Filmed in Boston with a lot of landmarks and an intense scene that takes place inside Fenway Park. Ben Affleck obviously can nail the Boston accent, but Jeremy Renner and Blake Lively do a wicked good job sounding like real Bostonians too.",1464220800,,239,4.714285714285714

The pacing was taut and tight and there was plenty of suspense and drama.  There  was not one wasted, extra minute.

also a quality that reminded me of ""On the Waterfront"": A young man trying to be a man in a tough working-class environment, who meets a soft and gentle woman.",1460332800,2,730,4.5813953488372094

4288374,2,B0049EO108,"Contrived and unconvincing story about a Boston bank robber who wants to turn over a new leaf but keeps getting pulled back. The dialog is embarrassing, the plot is ridiculous (more costume changes than Liberace) and so is a lot of the acting. The theme is pretty similar to Good Will Hunting in its focus on tribal Boston, the bad boy/good girl combination, and someone who wants to leave the tribe but cant quite do it. But this film lacks Matt Damon and Robin Williams, who gave that one its charm. One of the low points is I think it is Blake Lively who is unable to keep in character with her fake Russian accent. But lots of good car chases, car crashes, shootings, and inept police work, if that is what you are into.",1458950400,,724,4.37037037037037

4289113,4,B0049EO108,"Somewhere between Gone, Baby, Gone and Argo, Ben Affleck directed the Town, from a book by Chuck Hogan, about a bank robbing crew screwing itself into a corner. Pete Postelwaite (spelling?) gives his last performance, and he strips the robbers who come to him like he strips flowers; a truly menacing performance.  Titus Welliver (Harry Bosch in the future) and John Hamm play respectively a Boston Detective and an FBI Special Agent who fruitlessly persue Affleck's crew.  Lots of grimy Boston detail and violence keep this tight noir afloat.  I like it.",1437955200,,555,5.010869565217392

I am hugely critical of a great deal of cinema, these days (a lot of ""unoriginal"" material; feeding of action, obvertness instead of suspense and subtlety). I went into this movie expecting the same - and perhaps that's why I could not take my mind away from a single minute of this minute. Of course, the movie is based upon a book - a book I have not read and therefore cannot offer that ""analysis"".

4289299,4,B0049EO108,"The Town
 Now Ben Affleck has some bragging rights in his career that in some small way meets the expectations generated when he and his lifelong pal Matt Damon received Oscars as very young Hollywood successes.  This is one of a very small handful of really good movies that we have been given this year.  It is a gritty heist movie set in Boston and will immediately spur comparisons to The Departed, the enormously successful and brilliant Martin Scorsese film which stared Matt Damon.  The Town doesnt quite rise to the peak ascended by The Departed but it is still a heck of a good movie.
 Affleck stars in this film and also wrote and directed it.  This is a bold and dangerous trifecta for a movie guy to indulge in.  If the film is less than perfect, he has no one to blame but himself.  It puts Affleck all in, as the gamblers say.  And Affleck wins big.
 The movie has two stories that are shuffled together.  In story one, Affleck leads a gang of bank and armored car robbers in Boston.  They are very successful and very disciplined, which is why they are successful.  Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker) is picture perfect as Afflecks friend and dangerously fey second in command.  We have to penetrate the world of criminal class Irish in Boston to understand the motives and aspirations of the robbers.  Renners character is a criminal reflection of the ancient, doomed heroes of Irish lore.  He can think of nothing better to do than push his luck until it runs out.
 In story two, Affleck and bank manager Rebecca Hall become involved when Affleck enters her life to spy on her.  She managed a bank the gang robbed and Affleck hopes to thwart an ongoing FBI investigation.  Their love affair is very carefully and believably crafted.  With such a preposterous premise this is not easy.  Hall is outstanding in a very complex and subtle performance.
 In the film, Affleck is a robber, deceiver and a vengeful murderer, and still we root for him because he shows depth to his personality that we can identify with and support.  We hope that, against the odds, he will find a way to peace and happiness, through the blood, lies and chaos of his life.  It is a very good movie.
 Four stars for this heist flick.  It is rated R for sex, language and adult themes.  We get our moneys worth with a film that runs just over two hours.  With a budget of $37 million and an opening weekend of $24 million, Affleck has justified the producers faith in his skills.",1428451200,,2465,4.515837104072398
4289300,4,B0049EO108,"If you love Heat (De Niro and Pacino, 1995) and that genre, I recommend this movie. I can't remember a better Afflack performance and he directed. Jeremy Renner is great as well. If your from Boston, it's a must see.",1428364800,,216,4.425

4289307,3,B0049EO108,"Elemlements of the story were good, but they were just not executed well.  Ben Afflecks journey out of 'the town' for a better life in the suburbs seems dated and almost like a sub-plot, when that was the actual point of the movie.

Also, as a Bostonian, (and even as not) the setting was / is way too nice to be the 'hard' place they depict. Too much of a stretch of the imagination with no real imagery to support it besides some dirty dishes and a run down bar... I wish I lived there!

4289326,5,B0049EO108,"Not sure why this film got me the way it did. I've watched it at least four times over the years. Suspenseful, very well acted, interesting story, well-developed characters. Affleck plays a guy who is trying to change his life, but his old friends - especially Jeremy Renner's hot-headed character - and his old life of crime keep pulling him back down. I really liked the realistic portrayal of the neighborhoods and the people - gritty and blue-collar, salt of the earth types. Blake Lively is astonishing, Chris Cooper is great, Renner is great, Pete Postelthwaite (RIP) is great. The one weak link was Jon Hamm as an FBI agent - sorry but he's  way too much of a pretty boy to even try to play tough, so his most dramatic lines were a little giggle-inducing. Overall, a very worthwhile film, though. I love the scene where they are about to rob a bank. They are in an SUV wielding AK-47's with nun masks on, and they roll past a ten year old boy on the street who just stares at them with his mouth open. Classic!",1425945600,,1017,4.438502673796791

While more than a little formulaic, this film rolls along nicely with mostly plausible performances and, of course, the compulsory set-piece car chases and shoot-outs. What really stands out, unfortunately, is the constantly mumbled dialogue, the main culprits being Affleck and Renner. The late, great Pete Postlethwaite did his best with a mediocre role but there was no opportunity even for him to shine. All-in-all, a rather disappointing film; without the mumbling it would have been an enjoyable though unremarkable addition to the heist genre despite the woeful lack of originality.",1420934400,,810,5.143939393939394

'The Town' is pretty entertaining and has good acting all-around. However, I was just wanting more. I don't know what it is, but I felt this movie could have been so much better.

Ben Affleck directs a very taught drama here and intertwines complex relationships based on friendships, love and the concept of loyalty to one's roots. I really liked Ben Affleck's performance in this film. It is amazing. He is very stoic and he delivers more here in this performance than he has in any other film of his that I have seen. There is not a wasted frame of film, not a wasted moment of screen time. No matter how insignificant or subtle, it all counts. This is a must see film.

The combined efforts of Ben Affleck's direction, Robert Elswit's cinematography, Sharon Seymour's production design, all the actor's performances and the team of writers' work on this film is brilliant and exceptional.",1413417600,,739,4.818897637795276

4289487,2,B0049EO108,"This review will contain spoilers.

Doug (Ben Affleck) is a member of a bank heist gang in Charlestown Massachusetts. We are told that this is ""the town"" that produces the highest number of bank robbers and it's passed down from one generation to the next. This particular gang is very professional and knows its way around a bank and all the security systems. They are also very ruthless. That is, until Doug falls hard for a beautiful bank manager (Claire) and empathizes with the fear she felt during his gang's heist at her bank. At that point he begins to question the harm he is doing to people. Using his considerable charms, Doug gets involved with Claire, who is certainly an upgrade from the drug-addicted prostitute single mothers he usually hangs out with. Claire empathizes with Doug because he had a tough childhood and, worst of all, lost his mother. Claire is good for Doug and he now wants to get out of the bank heist business, but - surprise, surprise - there are other people who don't want to allow Doug to ride off into the sunset to live happily ever after. And, of course, they threaten to kill Claire.

What seems most annoying to me is the scene when Doug tells Claire he won't lie to her anymore, and she asks if he has ever killed anyone. With a straight face Doug says he hasn't. Maybe he hasn't, maybe he has. It's hard to tell because of all the shooting that goes on. The gang uses automatic machine guns and they don't hesitate to use them when being chased by police. If Doug, or a member of his gang, has somehow managed not to kill anyone, it's pure luck. Claire seems to be perfectly okay with a bank robber who uses assault weapons, but she draws the line at killing. Like I said, she empathizes with his tough childhood.

Doug is a good-looking, charming, intelligent guy. He's got a decent union job and he could have an even better job if he wanted one. It's never really explained why he decided to start robbing banks, but I think we're supposed to believe it has something to do with his father, now in jail for robbing banks and killing people and, of course, because of the loss of his mother. That's a recurring theme. Even Doug's killer father is redeemed a bit with the mother theme.

With so many rave reviews, I expected more from this movie. Even though I knew it was an action film, and even though I don't have high expectations for action films (all I expect, really, is lots of action), the lousy romance and the misguided empathy elements in the plot render this movie ridiculous and unsatisfying.",1412640000,,2554,4.509719222462203

4289508,1,B0049EO108,"I have a great deal of respect for Ben Affleck as an actor and director. This movie is pretty bad though (a very generous 2 stars), though I don't like saying it. The pros are that Ben and other fine actors are in it. Love that it shows a part of Boston many of us are unaware of. But the film suffers from some major braking flaws.

1) It's difficult if not impossible to have any sympathy/empathy for Ben's character - this makes it hard to care that much about what happens.

2) Ben's accomplices, well, one in particular, is so gross that, because Ben does nothing, it puts it on him (the only thing both deserve is to be put away).

3) I used to live in Boston, and there aren't that many women who are as attractive and, yes, unfathomably stupid, as the woman who plays opposite Ben's character. This movie is bad enough that I'm starting to watch it for the sake of humor.",1409356800,2,879,4.251497005988024

Its a robbery movie starring Ben Affleck that takes place in Charlestown, Boston. The guys dress up with masks on their face, go in with a plan, and take the money and cruise out. In one of the robberies the manager trips an alarm and they take the assistant manager as a hostage. Affleck follows her around after the robbery to make sure she doesnt talk but ends up falling for her. They do more robberies and things don't go as right. Eventually theres a shoot out at the end. My description sounds like many movies of this genre but the director (Affleck again) does everything right. The action sequences are well planned out and gets your adrenaline pumping. The storyline may not be the most original but they do it really well and add in a few surprises.

4289610,5,B0049EO108,"What a film!  ""The Town"" is a powerful testament to the skills of Ben Affleck, who did triple duty as the co-writer, director, and star of this taut, exciting crime-thriller.  The film is set in Charlestown, the oldest neighborhood in the city of Boston, a one-square mile hotbed of drugs, muggings, armed robberies and other assorted nefarious activities.  Affleck plays a member of a gang of second-generation criminals who were born and raised in ... and seemingly unable to escape from ... this toxic environment.  Following a daring bank robbery, Affleck makes the mistake of falling in love with one of the bank's employees (Rebecca Hall), who is unaware that he was the thief who took her hostage during the heist.  Complicating matters is the fact that the FBI is closing in, putting all sorts of pressure on the gang, particularly the violent hothead (Jeremy Renner) whose family took Affleck under their wing when his father went to prison.  Now the gang is being pressured by an underworld kingmaker (Pete Postlethwaite) to pull off another huge, tremendously complicated and risky job.

Not only does Affleck do yeoman's service as an actor and director, he manages to pull amazing performances from the rest of the cast, especially Renner who received a boatload of Supporting Actor nominations, including bids for the Oscar and the Golden Globe.  In his penultimate performance (he died before the movie was released), Pete Postlethwaite oozes barely contained menace, and actress Blake Lively is disturbingly effective as Renner's junkie sister.  Kudos also to Rebecca Hall, Jon Hamm (as a hard-nosed FBI agent), and Chris Cooper, who makes a strong impression in his brief scene as Affleck's bitter father.

There are numerous versions of the film available on video, including the theatrical cut, an extended cut, and a special collector's edition.  I viewed the single-disc blu-ray, which offered both the theatrical version and the extended cut on the same disc.  Many enthusiasts were concerned about the possibility of compression issues affecting this release, but I thought it looked and sounded fantastic.  I'm usually kind of picky about such things, but I was so involved in the story and the performances that any flaws went unnoticed.  ""The Town"" is a harbinger of a blossoming film talent that would come to fruition in Affleck's award-winning ""Argo"" two years later.  Highly recommended.",1386892800,7,2417,5.161538461538462

4289626,4,B0049EO108,"A good script, a good cast, lead to a great movie! Ben Affleck proves he knows how to make a movie leaving film lovers glued to the screen. Ben plays a criminal mastermind with a crew that works very well together. Jon Hamm plays an FBI agent who swears to bring him down. When the opening scene of Ben and his crew taking a bank down goes wrong, they take a hostage, an employee from the bank. When they release her they learn she talks to the cops and lives in the vicinity where the crew lives. Fearing she will lead the FBI to them, the crew wants to take her out, but Ben says no. He courts her, dines her, tries to get the feel for what her plans are. Jon Hamm diligently does everything his power allows him to find out who this crew is and bring them down. When Ben tries to get out of town before it's too late, his crew threaten him. He must pull off one last heist before being given his freedom.

The Town is an exciting movie that you will not want to miss. It has action, drama, suspense all rolled into one.

Blake Lively actually gives the best performance, followed by Jeremy Renner (not a big favorite of mine), but knowing that they both had to learn the accent and ""street"" ways they portray in the movie to the point they're so believable actually turned me around and made me a fan of both.  Ben Affleck always does a pretty good job but the other two impressed me where they hadn't really before and the use of relative unknowns was a welcome surprise.  Definitely a good movie for Movie Night at home.  Just not with the kids...",1376524800,,559,4.56

It was cast well, writen well, and the actoes delivered on their roles enough to make you, like in Heat, root for the bad guys. My one star deduction was geared more toward that reason. While original in setting and the dynamic and drive of most of the characters it bares too much resemblence to Heat, and is shot in what is either flattery or ripoff of Michael Manns style. While good, and carried out well, I think it leans a little too much on heist movies that have come before it, and should have stood up on its own accord.",1375920000,,596,4.427272727272728

4289652,4,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck is an interesting talent. Is he better at acting or directing? Maybe he's equally good at both. I believe he wrote this one, as well, so there's the trifecta!

It's a great love story wrapped in a drama wrapped in a crime thriller. Affleck's character is conflicted throughout the film, wanting to get out of the life he's built for himself, and his love interest (Rebecca Hall) is easy to watch on the screen. Her character is strong, but she's also traumatised by her ordeal at the beginning of the film.

The problem with this movie is that it suggest love conquers all - even betrayal. For me, the ending was not realistic, but it's subjective. You might find it satisfying and romantic. Definitely watch it and make up your own minds :)",1375488000,,753,4.57037037037037

4289671,4,B0049EO108,"Good casting and some good writing are what make this film enjoyable through multiple viewings. But it would be hard to sit through even once if it weren't for the lush backdrops of Charlestown and Boston. This is one of the rare caper flicks that have a sense of place. The scenes are not shot in back-alleys in Toronto posing as Chicago, or Vancouver posing as Anytown USA. Even though the streets look a little too chocolate-boxy, like they just had the cleaning people in and took away all the scaffolding and rubbish tips to make it nice for the conventioneers and tourists, it's pleasant to have some verifiable reality up there on the screen.

The best things, beside the location sets, are Jon Hamm being an overbearing FBI jerk, the rubberized zombie-nun disguises, and the grotesque Fergie character talking about gelding a horse (Pete Postlethwaite's last role). Rebecca Hall is nice too. She is English but really has the proper general-American intonation down, neither faux-Boston nor incongruously Midwestern nor that awful crass combination of Brooklyn-Jew and California-zonker that so many Brit and Australian actors come up with when playing Americans (Peter Sellers in 'Lolita,' Rachel Griffiths in 'Blow'). She is pretty and brings off a difficult and rather thankless role of being, well, pretty. And a victim.

Bad things are those elements that beggar belief: Ben Affleck's ridiculous fake tattoos, which seem to have been applied the day before and have all the trite multicolored-dragon elements that will be regrettable in ten years. Jem, the character with the stupid leprechaun tattoo-decal on the back of his neck, would have not been wearing a gold cross on a chain (what is he, Sicilian?), and if he ever acquired that green tattoo, it's a pretty good bet that his associates would make him get it lasered off, if only for the reason that it becomes a minor plot-element in the movie.

I found much of the low-life social atmosphere repellent too. The Affleck character would not have been moving in those circles--how much has his character made by now? two million dollars? Fergie, the English-Irish capo, would have had a different self-presentation too. He's supposed to be a florist in a yuppified neighborhood, but he looks and behaves like the assistant fight-trainer in an old boxing movie.

My husband would easily give this a 5, but the sordid and incredible aspects knock it down a notch for me. Still, I've seen it a dozen times, and rented it on Amazon instant only because we recently lent out the DVD I bought!",1371427200,,2557,4.93953488372093

4289676,4,B0049EO108,"Given Affleck's close association with Matt Damon; it was very hard not to keep comparing this film with Academy Award winning movie THE DEPARTED. The fact that I'm Irish and have a weak spot for films set in Boston makes it even more difficult to say THE DEPARTED was a slightly better film. The love story in THE TOWN is much better, the acting is comparable...maybe that's it. THE TOWN does not have quite the A-List star power that THE DEPARTED did.

It can't be that the action sequences are inferior.  THE TOWN's bank robbery scenes make for some taut action drama.  Maybe I should be comparing this film to HEAT, which is a damn fine film and also about bank robberies. These are some elite company for ANY movie to be traveling in. I guess I would rank HEAT at four stars, THE TOWN at four and a half, and THE DEPARTED as five stars.

There is a sequence in THE TOWN between Affleck's character and his life long friend; played by Academy Award winning actor Jeremy Renner. Not only does this sequence epitomize these nature of these two characters; and the bond between them; feel it should be nominated to the Halls of Vahalla of great Tough Guy Moments:

 [small spoiler]

Doug MacRay: I need your help. I can't tell you what it is, you can never ask me about it later, and we're gonna hurt some people.
[Jem pauses to think for a moment]
James Coughlin: Whose car are we gonna take?

I'm sorry, but that pause there when you're wondering what Renner is going to say, what questions he may ask, what objections he might raise and what reservations he could possibly have.... All those character issues are resolved instantly in what I consider one of the greatest I'VE GOT YOUR BACK, BRO'. moments ever set to celluloid. There is REALLY never any question Rennar's character was going to do it and we the audience are lessened for not having already known that. Tough Guy poetry.",1370044800,2,1890,4.538235294117647

It also comes across naturally that the kingpin might be a low-key small business owner and that the most talented robber might gradually fall in love with a former hostage (partly because he's looking for an excuse to take a pile of cash and sneak out of Boston forever as the feds are hot on their trail.)  The final heist is one of the more creative on film.,1364169600,,487,4.46067415730337

Kudos to Mr. Affleck both for his acting and his directing. Great also is Jeremy Renner as his unstable second in command and Blake Lively as his suffering X. I couldn't believe she was only like 23 when she did this movie. She comes across as someone much older and world weary. The whole movie is full of great supporting performers. Lots of things going on in this movie; struggles between class and family legacy. A great movie I never tire of watching.

Doug refuses to allow Krista to come with him, and even says out of everyone he can think of he should take Shyne away from her and take her with him. Krista gets in a car accident, and desperate to keep custody of Shyne she makes a deal with the FBI, in exchange for them not taking her daughter she tells them about the heist planned.

I liked the characters, the pacing, the set design, the cinematography, most of the dialogue and the locations were excellent. Affleck made a pretty descent back story as well. There are only a small handful of slight changes I felt would have made this movie better.

First, I would suggest they cast Robert DeNiro for Ben Affleck, Al Pacino for Jon Hamm, Val Kilmer for Jeremy Renner, Amy Brenneman for Rebecca Hall, Ashley Judd for Blake Lively, Tom Sizemore for Owen Burke and Jon Voight for Pete Postlethwaite.  Also, I would suggest that they filmed the movie in the backdrop of Los Angeles. Finally, I would suggest they called the movie ""HEAT.""

Because that's what this movie was. Like I said earlier, I really enjoyed this movie, but I couldn't help draw all the parallels to the Michael Mann original.",1363392000,,889,4.685897435897436

As part of ""Digital"" products being offered my Amazon.com, I would like to point out that the XBOX interface is better than netflix, its faster to load and navigate. However, there is no option for subtitles for this movie, which makes it difficult to watch when you have kids or other members of the house sleeping in adjacent rooms. The Amazon app on XBOX lacks the ability to purchase new content, I think thats partly due to the way purchase options are set up on XBOX.

4289764,4,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck's ""The Town"" is based on Chuck Hogan's book ""Prince of Thieves"" (later released under the name ""The Town"" to capitalize on its tie-in to the movie), and it is a remarkably faithful adaptation of a truly engrossing book. I read the book just a couple of weeks before renting the movie, and I often find that this is a recipe for disaster as far as the movie is concerned (it is just very hard to compete with a reader's imagination).

Instead, however, I found that actually seeing the familiar Boston landmarks brought the book alive in a very different way. The story is very well translated to screen and the constant tension from the book manifests itself very well on-screen.

There are a few notable things in the movie: the late Pete Postlethwaite is typically terrific in a small but powerful role, Jeremy Renner plays a slightly out-of-control character that is very different from his Bourne or Hawkeye characters, and Rebecca Hall is nearly perfect in the role of Claire (vulnerable but strong, pretty but not glamorous). It is also interesting to see Jon Hamm (of Mad Men fame) in a current day role as an FBI agent who shares almost nothing with his Don Draper character on the television show.

This is the second of Ben Affleck's movies as a director (""Gone Baby Gone"" was first and ""Argo"" is the third), and it is a terrific piece of work.",1356480000,,1366,4.636363636363637
4289765,4,B0049EO108,"The Town has made it's way into the ranks of the best heist and bank robbery movies ever made. But for a better overall experience, you need to watch the Extended Alternate Cut. The extended portion of the film does more to develop the characters and provide a further backstory and the alternate cut changes the ending to a better, more fitting ending that faithfully reflects the source material.

It may be 'Ben Affleck's' movie, but Jeremy Renner absolutely stole the show. In fact, Affleck may never again want to cast Renner in anything he does ever again because of how much he stole the show from Ben. If you've seen the Theatrical version and enjoyed it, but had issues with the ending, watch the Alternate Cut, it will change everything for you, I know it did for me.",1356393600,14,777,4.589928057553957

4289770,5,B0049EO108,"As good as his first directorial effort was, The Town completely blows it aways.  Ben Affleck plays Doug, a career criminal from Charlestown that is looking for a way out of his dead end life.  He is the leader of a crew that goes around town and robs different banks and armored cars.  One day, his crew robs a bank but things don't go according to plan and they take a hostage.  Since she lives close to where these guys live, Doug decides to keep tabs on her to make sure if she really knows anything.  The problems really start when Doug and the hostage start to develop feelings for each other.  This is when the big question comes:  What will happen if she ever learns the truth about Doug.  The Town is truly one of this year's best films and it is a crying shame that it almost entirely shut out of the Academy Awards expect for Jeremy Renner's strong performance as Doug's frinend, Jem, and it netted him a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  The direction, writing and performance are all first rate.  When you watch this film, it feels real.  The robberies, the settings and the characters all feel reel.  I tip my hat to Mr. Affleck for his excellent direction, strong screenplay and for turning in a great performance as the conflicted bank robbery.  Jeremy Renner was scary as hell because you had no idea what this crazy fool was going to say or do next but you can see the loyalty he has to Doug.  The rest of cast including Blake Lively, Rebecca Hall and John Hamm were all amazing as well.  I highly recommend watching this movie.",1355529600,,1547,4.4361702127659575

4289777,3,B0049EO108,"The bottom line is that The Town is very entertaining, the highlight being the psychotic Jeremy Renner. It's enjoyable as a crime procedural, but I sense Affleck was trying to transcend the crime genre, and for me, he didn't succeed.

First my issues:

My initial problem with the film is the numerous plot holes and strange character motivations. In the movie, one of Affleck's crime buddies sacrifices himself for his team, yet he is not set up as a self-sacrificing character. Affleck hijacks a police car in broad daylight in the middle of a police investigation, and although Jon Hamm notices, he doesn't think it's strange that a cop car is leaving a brand new crime scene. And how does Affleck get access to buses and all those convenient uniforms? These are some issues I wish were addressed and would have been in a better film.

Some scenes are merely expositional, especially the initial scenes between Rebecca Hall and Affleck. They converse about the bank robbery, but we don't see the chemistry build over time. I didn't believe in the relationship because we never saw Blake Lively's character's reaction to Affleck not spending time with her and because Rebecca Hall and Affleck seemed to have gone on six or seven dates before they kissed. Maybe I'm biased, but it seems like that's too long for anyone to wait for a first kiss, especially a Charlestown bankrobber.

The action scenes are adequate, but I become wary of any film that features professional policemen missing targets at close range while firing automatic weapons.

What I liked about the movie:

Jeremy Renner's character brings out the best of the film. You never know when he's going to mess up the situation, and there is one terrific scene where he catches Affleck at lunch with Rebecca Hall. Suspense is built just through a few glances and hand movements. In fact, the movie works best when its being subtle about what's happening. There's another great scene where Jon Hamm threatens Blake Lively with a dollar bill. And another where a cop pretends not to witness a robbery.

The Town, like a lot of Boston movies (Good Will Hunting, The Departed) is about changing your way of life. I'm glad Affleck dove into the motivations of a bank robber. He was raised by a bank robber and is in a situation where he is pressured to steal by his peers (and later we find out what the consequences of him not stealing are). The movie builds upon the classic moral dilemma of a man forced to do evil against his will, and like a Greek tragedy, we see the consequences of his best intentions. The Town is a fine film to watch, gripping and entertaining, but at the end, I was left disappointed by the lazy plot, especially because I felt these issues could have been easily cleaned up. I hope Affleck will continue growing as a director; he is certainly a competent one -- he knows how to build suspense and has a flair for picking good subjects, which is the most important skill a filmmaker can have. After all, you can learn how to write or direct better, but you can never learn good taste.",1353801600,,3071,4.6654343807763405

The story follows an elite mechanic/hitman as he weaves through deception and retribution while mentoring the son (played excellently by Foster) of his former friend and boss (Sutherland). Foster was the reason I watched this and have been a fan of his since 11:14; itself an overlooked but good film. Above all of the usual Statham faces, inept bad guys, great stunts and token eye candy, Foster actually carries this film for me and proves himself again.

The picture quality was average at times, with a great deal of exteriors having that grainy look, but other times the clarity was above par.

4289784,4,B0049EO108,"I have spilled much ink talking about the corner boy society that I grew up in 1950s Olde Saco (that's up in Maine for those interested) where some hard-ass (and soft-ass too) corner boys ripped up the imaginations of wanna-bes like me and my corner boys  who hung around, soft-ass hung around, Mama's Pizza Parlor over on Atlantic Avenue, waiting, well, waiting for some  breathe of fresh air, maybe coming in from the nearby ocean to wash over us and take out of that red scare cold war night. In the meantime we hung out, doing a little of this and a little of that, some stuff legal other stuff well, let's just leave it as other stuff. So on any given night, mostly weekends, from about junior high school on you could find us in those environs playing pinball on Mama's back room machine, the Madame LaRue busty ladies pictured on the scoreboard begging you to play for their favors, play fiercely although empty-handedly (except those seventeen free games you racked up in your, ah, frenzy to please Madame). Or when rock and roll threw its fresh breathe over us we tossed many quarters to hear the latest songs about twelve times straight and hoped that certain shes came in to listen and maybe help make us those selections. Or, on some dark night, we might just be found doing our midnight creep around the neighborhood in order to make ends meet, that little of this and that stuff mentioned early.

As high school turned to work world ,or maybe college world, the old corner boy society, or our generation's chapter of it, went in several difference directions, some good some not so good, including those like the legendary Big Red Dubonnet who graduated to armed robberies of gas stations, liquor stores and Shawshank. Yah, Big Red was tough (I once saw him chain-whip, mercilessly chain-whip, a guy for the simple error of being on the wrong corner, Red's, while breathing), was pretty smart, in a street smart way, knew a couple of things about the world and, and, be still my heart, let me have some free Madame LaRue games after he had racked up a ton and needed to take care of some ever present girl business.

And that is where memories of Big Red and the characters that inhabit The Town intersect in my mind. See Big Red, the late Big Red now, never could find anything better in this whole wide world than being king hell king of the corner boy night. But that takes dough, and so you either work the work-a-day world with the squares or go where the dough is- for Big Red in Podunk gas stations and liquors stores and the guys like Doug and Jem who lead their peoples, their Charlestown corner boy peoples, banks, and other high-stakes projects. Thus this film held me, held me in the thought that for a minute back in the 1950s, hell, more than a minute, I could have been lured to the life, no sweat. And while this film gets wound up in little bizarre love interest between Doug and one of the bank victims and some serious literary license on what was what in that old time Boston Irish neighborhood, Charlestown (where the guys were so tough that even tough guys from Southie, South Boston, had second thoughts about tangling with them, these grown-up corner boys were very recognizable.

Oh yah, I don't know how true the code of omerta (silence) still is in Charlestown (or Southie, or about seventeen other places where corner boys, some corner boys anyway go on to the life) but I am willing to believe that it is honored more in the breech than the observance. At least it was in Podunk.  How do you think they (and you know who the they is just like in film, the cops from the locals to the feds) got the lead that got Big Red after he knocked over the biggest liquor store in Portland that last time before they clipped his wings?",1353196800,,3767,4.5

The characters in The Town are absolutely unmemorable and unlikable. Even bad characters can be sentimental. Affleck just didn't try to make this film better. It's contrived, in every way imaginable.

Nevertheless, The Town showcases some nailed performances - particularly the mentioned Jeremy Renner but also Affleck himself, the reliable Chris Cooper, Blake Lively, and Pete Postlethwaite - characters which anyone familiar with the neighborhoods depicted would recognize, certainly to a greater extent than, say, The Departed.
It is impressively constructed, production-wise and narratively, if a bit less sweeping than some of the influences it echoes (the original Thomas Crown Affair, The Friends Of Eddie Coyle, Heat, Monument Ave, Boondock Saints, The Brinks Job, even Point Break), and perhaps we should take Mr. Affleck seriously as the actual brains behind the Affleck-Damon partnership.",1349913600,,756,5.758928571428571

4289800,1,B0049EO108,"This review applies just to the two disc blue ray extended cut version and I can sum it up in two words - ""DON'T BOTHER"".  Don't get me wrong, ""The Town"" is a great movie even though it softens the character of Doug Macrae AND lets him live at the end.  Also, it eliminates the relationship with the FBI agent and adds some sex.  Still a great gangster movie.  Ben Affleck had the same problem with ""Gone Baby Gone"".  Anyone who read the book knows that Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan were totally wrong as Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro but still it was a fine movie.  The problem with the extended version of ""The Town"" is that the added scenes were added haphazardly and didn't always make sense.  There was one or two scenes that added a little nuance but was not really worth it.  Not like the extended versions of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies which really added to the theatrical releases.  My guess is that Ben Affleck didn't have anything to do with the extended versions because he seem more professional than that.

The other reason I bought the extended version was that I had read somewhere that a version of the movie had been done with a different ending and I was hoping that it was more in keeping with the book.  Unfortunately, the purchase did not fulfill the desire.  So don't bother with the extended version, especially if you already have the regular one.  It is not worth it.

Though I rated this with ""one star"" for the above reason, the movie is actually at least ""four stars"" leaning very heavily into ""five stars"".",1347840000,5,1550,4.489285714285714
4289801,4,B0049EO108,"Early reviewers who deemed this film ""Heat with a Boston accent"" clearly missed a great deal of the subtlety, inflection, and sheer artisanship of The Town. It's actually a highly original piece of work-- a crackling crime thriller with a very cleverly developed script, gritty authenticity, and terrific performances from all hands, especially Rebecca Hall and the late great Peter Postlewaite. Indeed it's the second time that Affleck has taken a beach-read book and constructed a better, more resonant film from it (the first was his underrated debut Gone Baby Gone, based on a Dennis Lehane formula mystery).

On to the details of this edition:

This Blu-Ray version contains most of the same extras as the non Blu-Ray Special Edition-- a disc worth of vignettes that focus on the making of the film. As is typical of films that veer from a central truth in the interest of art, one theme explored is a sort of backhanded apologia: there's a glancing acknowledgement that the Boston neighborhood Charlestown (The Town of the title) is no longer the hotbed of highly skilled bank robbers it was in the Fifties and Sixties.

Technical Notes: Visually, it's a dark film , with a very urban look, so the benefits of added detail take effort to find. The Blu Ray resolution gave me some plot details I had not discerned earlier: in the nuns-with-guns armored car robbery, you can now see gas cans in the rear seat, evidence that the thieves need to torch the getaway vehicle, and are willing to risk self-immolation to assure that trace evidence is consumed.

What is here is an alternate ending that is darker, cleverly interlaced with subplots developed early in the film, and far more faithful to the book, albeit slightly overtold by an unnecessary ""summing up"" fake news report. Oddly enough, the central theme of The Town is little changed by the changed outcome: bad deeds, even those that predate a moral redemption, still have consequences.

Highly recommended.",1347321600,2,1969,4.936555891238671

2)  Streaming quality was pretty bad in spots with noticeable pixallation.  True, this could be my less than adequate dsl, but then again, I never have this problem with Netflix.

4289808,3,B0049EO108,"A group of thugs from Charlestown, Boston, Mass. rob a bank. They take the bank manager (Rebecca Hall) along with them. They take her license and leave her by the ocean, only to find out she lives 4 blocks away. Ben Affleck, the brains of the group, stalks her to find out what she knows. He starts to date her and falls in love, or at least a Charlestown version of love, he buys her dinner, they have sex and he gets her a necklace. The relationship was not well developed due to the bad writing of Affleck who was more concerned about his scene shots than giving us a believable script. Ben and his boys rob more places. The FBI knows everyone in the gang who committed the crimes and start to close in to a final climatic scene.

Not Affleck's best role. Never write, direct and star in the same movie. This movie was referenced by the GOP to describe their relationship to the Tea Party with Affleck being the GOP and the Tea Party being his psycho killer friend...and the Tea Party liked the analogy.(Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger.)

It's very reminiscent of Heat with ingredients from The Departed (one of my tp five favorite films), but still manages to maintain its freshness. Affleck proved with Gone Baby Gone that he could direct, and he solidifies that notion with The Town. The Boston locations were beautiful to look at, with a few nice aerial shots. The tension is suspenseful enough to put a majority of the audience on the edge of its seat. The romantic aspect never got corny, and most of all, the accents never sounded forced to me. I've never been to Boston, but I'd be willing to bet that the actors sounded pretty legit. Jeremy Renner was simply amazing in the movie. He can pretty much play any role. I cannot wait to see him as my favorite Avenger, Hawkeye. John Hamm was great as well. Mr. Mad Men is coming up in the world.

4289816,4,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck's taut, exciting Boston crime thriller THE TOWN has returned to Blu-Ray in a terrific ""Ultimate Edition"" that offers both its theatrical version as well as a superior Director's Cut that enables the film to ""breathe,"" thereby correcting some of the reservations I had about the picture when I first saw it theatrically. It also exclusively adds a never-before-seen, 10 minute alternate ending which is incorporated into its own platter within the Extended cut.

Even more impressive than his prior ""Gone Baby Gone,"" ""The Town"" is a flavorful examination of a group of thieves led by Affleck's conflicted soul and his hothead friend (Jeremy Renner), who brazenly abducts a bank teller (the fetching Rebecca Hall) during a heist. The group lets her go, but worries that she'll talk lead Affleck to strike up a friendship intended to generate information that ultimately turns into a full-fledged relationship between them; meanwhile, the local crime boss (Pete Postelthwaite) forces Affleck and Renner to handle one last score by knocking over Fenway Park, while the FBI (led by ""Mad Men""'s Don Draper, Jon Hamm) closes in on them all.

""The Town"" isn't a revelation as far as its genre goes, but it's nevertheless well-acted, superbly directed and memorably written with Affleck, Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard adapting Chuck Hogan's acclaimed novel ""Prince of Thieves."" Hall is terrific, Affleck is believable, Renner is intense, Postelthwaite adds another villainous role to his long line of characters, and Haam brings equal weight to his part of the FBI agent suspicious of Affleck and his gang. ""The Town"" mixes character development with suspense and a number of crackling good action sequences, including the Fenway climax that's superbly executed on a visceral level.

Affleck's longer Director's Cut lingers on a bit at 153 minutes but overall it adds more depth to the characters than the more confined 125 minute theatrical version allows. Both versions are on-hand in Warner's Ultimate Blu-Ray combo pack, presented on a single BD-50 platter with DTS Master Audio sound. The transfer looks every bit as solid as what I saw theatrically, though tech junkies have noted that both versions, being put on the same disc, suffer because of a low-bit rate encode that could've been improved upon. That said, I'm just going by what I see, and overall I doubt most HD viewers are going to detect any shortcomings with the presentation. The Extended Cut with alternate ending, meanwhile, is housed on both its own Blu-Ray and DVD in the three-disc package, offering a similar 1080p transfer with DTS MA audio (and a higher bit-rate that's not appreciably any better than the regular Blu-Ray).

Extras include new goodies (a brand-new documentary on the film plus ""Ben's Boston"") and fine extras from the prior release, including thoughtful commentaries by Affleck on all versions, a number of solid behind-the-scenes segments, an Ultraviolet digital copy and assorted film prop reproductions: a 15-page FBI report, four mug shot cards, a rub-on tattoo sheet, a letter from Affleck, a 48-page behind-the-scenes photo book, and a poster-sized map reproduction of Charlestown, Mass. with notes from the film incorporated.

4289817,3,B0049EO108,"The actors, especially the leads, were solid, the plot was pretty good and the action scenes were intense (particularly the car chase through the North End). But in the end, the sum of these parts added up to an average movie.

For starters, this movie is derivative of ""Heat"" is almost every way, a point that is hammered home when Affleck's Doug MacRay watches that movie during a brief scene. There's the obligatory stakeout scene with the feds watching the crew, a hardass cop hellbent on bringing the crew down, the narrow miss between the cops and the robbers, and the third party feeding the crew their jobs (all elements ripped from ""Heat""). There's also the ""one final heist"" (ripped from every crime movie ever).

However, ""The Town"" doesn't feature the same character development, pacing or tension that made ""Heat"" such a great film.

It was never clear why MacRay was so enamored of Rebecca Hall's Claire Keesey, other than she represents a straight life that he yearns for. But she is also the one person who can put him and his crew in jail, which one would think would kind of put a damper on things.

MacRay and Jeremy Renner's Jimmy Coughlin are the main characters in the movie and the viewer gets to know them best, but this comes at the expense of the other two guys on the crew, Gloansy and Desmond Eldon. At the end of the film the only thing the viewer can say with certainty is they were bank robbers; we know nothing of their families/friends.

Pacing wise, the movie falls into a pattern of robbery - Doug and Claire doing whatever - Jon Hamm (Agent Frawley) pursuing the crew (and failing) - robbery. It never really breaks from this cycle and it gets kind of monotonous.

It seems like there might have been a deeper story about MacRay's past addictions and how that would be effecting his current mood in the film, but that is hardly explored. Even in the extended edition it accounts for just one scene (he snorts Oxy) but then everything is back to the way it was. It would have been best if this was fleshed out or left out altogether.

On the plus side, Affleck does a wonderful job of featuring the Boston scenery and, as one other reviewer pointed out, really turns the city into another character. Affleck, Renner and Blake Lively turn in solid performances (Lively is almost unrecognizable as Coughlin's addict sister). Hamm's role seemed like a wasted role, and if not that then certainly one-dimensional.

4289834,2,B0049EO108,"As the Coen brothers did in Fargo, Affleck does a wonderful job of making the place character in the movie. High speed chases down narrow Boston streets and the feel of the Charlestown community let you know that this is a story about a place and not just people. But, apparently unlike 90 percent of other viewers, that's about the extent of the praise I can offer this film, one I really wanted and expected to like.

It simply crumbles under the weight of its implausibility and unbelievability. The smart girl gets blinded by the love for an outlaw theme is really played out by now. Like Tara in ""Sons of Anarchy"" Claire makes me want to hit her over the head more than connect with her. I guess Jon Hamm is just too good looking to be portrayed as a bumbling lawman on the tail of a cunning criminal, but that's almost the impression one gets. There's just too much that doesn't makes sense about these two characters to accept what happens in the story.

The ending, if you can call it an ending, while it seems touching on the surface, leaves at least two very important unanswered questions that one has to ask when following through the result to its logical conclusion.

The lead and supporting performers are all strong, and Affleck's handling of the place and action were well-crafted. He needs to pick a better story (and possibly another lead actor) for his next directorial effort though.",1324771200,,1404,4.608

Based on the novel by Chuck Hogan, ""The Town"" is a superb drama set in Charlestown, Massachusetts, a neighborhood in Boston that has the dubious distinction of being the bank and armored-car robbery capital of the world.  Writer/director Ben Affleck plays Doug MacCray, the leader of a sometimes unruly Irish gang that routinely engages in both those activities (the other members of the team include Jeremy Renner, Slaine, and Owen Burke).  On one of their robberies, one of the members goes rogue by kidnapping an attractive bank manager and taking her along with them as a hostage.  Although she is blindfolded the entire time and is eventually set free, several of the robbers fear she may still someday be able to testify against them were they ever to come to trial.  To protect her against the more dangerous members of the group, Doug insinuates himself into her life and quickly finds himself developing a serious attraction to her.

""The Town"" works beautifully on so many different levels at once: as a thrilling crime-and-detection tale, a complex human drama, and a richly textured account of life in an individual neighborhood.  Doug may be torn between his criminal background and the love of a good woman who offers him a chance at a better life - but that doesn't stop him from still partaking in many of the foul deeds that have come to define his life over the years.  If anything, ""The Town"" shows just how deeply planted are the roots that bind us to the soil (i.e., neighborhood) of our past - and how hard it is to rip ourselves free from them and still continue to flourish.  In other words, it may be possible for a man to redeem himself in the eyes of God and his fellow citizens, but it may be a long and faltering journey on the way to that outcome.

As a character, Claire (Rebecca Hall) is equally three-dimensional and complex.  She's a decent, hardworking young woman who tends her own garden in the city and volunteers her time in helping the youth in her community.  When she meets Doug, she is still traumatized by the events that have happened to her and is initially unaware that Doug had any part in them, believing him to be just an easygoing, compassionate man with whom she's falling in love.  How she'll react when she finds out the truth about Doug and how that revelation will affect their burgeoning relationship provides the key emotional focal point of the drama.

Running contrapuntally to the romance is the attempt on the part of the FBI, led by John Hamm (minus his Don Draper Brylcreemed hair), and the Boston Police Department to capture the band of thieves.  There are moments of breath-bating suspense as the law inexorably closes in on its target, and Affleck proves once again that that much abused standby known as the ""car chase"" can still be a potent storytelling device when we actually care about what happens to the characters - even those it is not always all that easy to like.",1322438400,,2951,4.680851063829787
4289837,5,B0049EO108,"I like a good thriller, but sometimes I find there is a bit too much gratuitous violence for my taste or that the plot is thin.  Thankfully for me and this film, neither is true.  I found there was just enough violence to make a point and to further the story, but not so much that it got in the way of the movie.  I also found the plot very compelling.  The romantic subplot to me, balanced things out and added complexity to the relationships and allowed us to see depth in Ben Affleck's character.  It makes him come across as real, as a guy whose life has been to many degrees, highly influenced by his rough home life and lack of positive influences.  He comes across as a guy who knows that what he is doing is wrong and who very much seemed to want to get out and have something more noble to show for himself, but who keeps getting dragged back in.

As a former Charlestown resident, I also really enjoyed the shots of Boston, Charlestown, and Cambridge in the movie.  A lot of times when I see movies set in Boston it's been clear that they do a few money shots in the city to give a sense of place, but that the bulk of shooting is done elsewhere.  This isn't the case of this movie, they show a lot of shots of the city, and to me, it really helped to give the movie a sense of place and authenticity.  I really appreciated seeing the shots of Charlestown.

Overall, whether I lived there or not, I found this a fantastic movie.",1322352000,2,1439,4.177536231884058

4289850,5,B0049EO108,"There are some films that tip the scales one way or the other when it comes to a crime drama.  With The Town, We get a nice balance.  It isn't very heavy in the urban drama department.  It also isn't overly sappy with the crime family element either.  Throw in the fact it could easily rival heist movies like The Dead Presidents and Point Break when it comes to high profile robbery setup and action scenes, and you have a winner.

Affleck is able to introduce a large variety of characters that all have a poignant purpose to the story.  MacRay's father, the lead FBI agent on the case, his former girlfriend, and the bank manager all could have slipped through the cracks like cardboard cutouts, but instead all shine along with the rest of the cast in this film.  Piven is, as always, a great addition to an already stellar story line.

Unlike some films of this genre, The Town is a compelling story that is able to put weight and importance on every scene it doles out.  Highly recommended.

There's a blend of action, romance, and intrigue, the acting is solid, the characters are believable while having depth, and the story is interesting in a Bostonian blue-collar struggle sort of way.  We wind up simultaneously disliking the lead character (because he's a criminal) and liking him (because he clearly still has goodness and moral criteria in him), and that ambivalence nicely ties in with real life.

Though there was a minor plot flaw which my wife picked up also, it wasn't large enough to ruin the movie, and overall I enjoyed the movie enough to readily recommend it.",1320710400,,707,4.723577235772358

Glorifying and romanticizing criminals is not responsible to the culture and kids unless that's what you want kids to become.

4289854,3,B0049EO108,"Excellent Affleck in this, excellent Rebecca Hall, all the performances, actually. It's 15 minutess too long, though, and the Fenway Park sequence was where to cut. (Far too similar to same scene in The Heat.)

But I hate films with shaky plot devices, and this film has one: so the young woman they fleetingly kidnap (Hall) lives in Charlestown? So what? She didn't see them, and it's doubtful they hang out at the same bars. So why would they all be so upset by discovering she might be a neighbor? But Affleck decides to keep an eye on her, see what she knows. Huh? Far better, I think, they bump into each other at same Laundromat -- in the Hollywood world, that's hardly a preposterous scenario -- and the relationship starts there. He is immediately taken by her (this time) and that element, kidnaper/victim, adds more, not detracts.

Loved the line, Affleck to the late great Pete Postlewaite, ""You think you're the only guy in Charlestown with a gun?""",1318982400,,960,4.674556213017752

The bank robberies, car chases and the ending are pure Hollywood and Affleck's character is awfully smart for a thug but hey, that's the story.  Somehow it all comes together rather well.  The Town does invite comparisons to Heat, and the scene where Hamm sits face to face with Affleck, each knowing what the other has done isn't up to the brilliance of the encounter between Pacino and DeNiro in Heat, but that's a pretty high hurdle.  Anyway, the performances are first rate and I see now why they advise you not to drive in Boston.",1318809600,,687,4.5528455284552845
4289856,5,B0049EO108,"I wasn't expecting a classic in the Town.  That's exactly what it is though.  Yup!

It's about a group of mask-wearing bank robbers that take a young woman hostage after collecting a ton of cash, and after the fearful woman is taken to an ocean and dropped off while blindfolded, a few days later the bank robbers finds where the woman lives (thanks to one of them taking her ID card during the hostage situation) and actually becomes romantically involved with her during an emotional meet up at the downtown laundromat.

It's interesting how the storyline only barely touches upon the actual romance.  The Town is most certainly an action/suspense movie because the man continues to rob banks with his buddies even after the involvement with the woman.

Throughout the film he has to try and find clever ways to hide the fact he was the one responsible for making the woman lifes traumatizing during the bank robbery.  Will she ever find out who he really is?  You'll have to watch it to find out.  Without giving anything away, there's some REALLY close calls (such as when the woman was able to identify a tattoo on the neck of one of the bank robbers, and later this very same man makes a surprise appearance when the woman is out on a date and sitting at an outside restaurant).

The future bank robberies really elevated the overall action factor to a new level of excitement and, for that matter, a new level of gun shooting segments.  These particular gun shooting segments are especially graphic and meaningful given the nature of the storyline and how it focuses on one aggressive group of bank robbers doing everything in their power to escape the FBI and defy the odds.

I was really caught up in the plotline and the solid acting abilities of everyone involved while watching the Town this afternoon, and, if anything else, the Town is perhaps a slightly different take on the somewhat tiresome bank robbery routine that's become boring and predictable over the years.  I thoroughly recommend it.",1318550400,,2010,4.741379310344827

4289868,5,B0049EO108,"In Boston's Charlestown neighborhood, robbing banks and armored cars is a cottage industry. This is the story of one of The Town's Gen X crews. This crew is good.

The movie opens with a -- you guessed it -- bank robbery. The bad guys are wearing masks and everything goes according to plan -- until the crew's hothead loses his composure, attacks a bank employee and kidnaps another.

This was not part of the plan.

The kidnapped employee is let go, physically unharmed, but the crew discovers she lives in The Town. Did she see something or hear someting that could identify them to the FBI? Will she recognize one of them at a local pub, laundromat or grocery store and call the police? The crew's ramrod decides to find out, before the crew's hothead solves the problem with murder. Problem is, Ramrod falls in love with the vic.

This was not part of the plan

Now, for the first time, Ramrod starts to see how he could lead a different way of life. But, for now, he's stuck in his current job. This conflict create's the story's central drama. I won't tell you if the conflict is resolved, or how, but if you see this movie you will have fun, and an interesting time, finding out.

The Town is lean and intense, and at times very violent. But the violence seems fairly real. People who get shot actually bleed and sometimes die. When vehicles crash people actually get hurt. The acting is first rate. The movie looks like, feels like and sounds like Boston (my favorite cold weather American city). In fact, it all seems real, quite an achievement given that the love story aspect is improbable.

If you like lean, intense crime thrillers with a love story on the side, this movie is for you. If you don't, well, see it anyway. It's that good.",1317513600,,1750,4.5015772870662465

4289870,5,B0049EO108,"At first this movie seems like another Bank-Robber/Gangster film.

But it quickly changes course, and becomes a fairly deep character-study and a painful, plausible, romance.

It does these last two things beautifully.  The plot, like the character Ben Affleck plays, moves steadily away from robbing and violence, and steadily toward change and honesty.

The heroine, Claire Keesey (played by Rebecca Hall), becomes both the agent and victim of this process, and herself changes and grows, often painfully, in the process.

I have lived in Boston, and I loved the claustrophobic, almost airless, street-level shots of cramped houses and stuffed-together warehouses.

And I LOVED the acting.  I knew Ben Affleck could act (after seeing him in ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""State of Play"") but I also knew he mostly doesn't (after seeing him in much else).  Here he is superb.  He underacts, which is precisely right for this role.

His foil is Jeremy Renner, who is superb.  This guy is the best actor in the world.  Eat your heart out, Kevin Spacey.

And Rebecca Hall, whom I had never seen before, is wonderful.  You can see her transformation happening before your eyes: from insular townie to wide-eyed dupe to shocked victim to sneaky conspirator.

And who knew Affleck could direct?  He does.  The movie works seamlessly.  It is exciting, and painful, and moving, and honest, and involving at every turn.

4289873,4,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck will be forever identified with two powerful influences on his life:  his friendship with fellow Hollywood demigod Matt Damon and his devotion to the city of Boston.  (You could also add the perils of over-exploiting the Hollywood celebrity machine with J-Lo as another influence, but that would be cruel.)

With ""The Town,"" Affleck follows in the footsteps of his friend Damon - is it a coincidence that Hollywood green-lit an Affleck-led Boston crime movie shortly after Damon's performance in ""The Departed""? - by making a terrific cops-and-robbers movie set in Boston.  With ""The Town,"" Affleck famously does the heavy lifting of directing, adapting the screenplay from a novel (""Prince of Thieves""), and starring.  I haven't read the book, but it's safe to say that he did a fine job with at least two of his three roles.

""The Town"" tells the story of a next-generation gang of Boston criminals, led by Doug McCray (Affleck).  His best friend, Jem (James Coughlin), has done nine years hard time after committing a crime to help Doug - think of Jem as a younger Boston-based version of Joe Pesci's various characters.  These guys rob banks and armored cars, and they are good - so good that the FBI is gunning for them.  FBI Agent Frawley (Jon Hamm) is on the case, and he's good at his job, too, so fireworks are guaranteed.

The main storyline involves a girl:  the gang hits a bank and in the process may have allowed the assistant bank manager Claire (Rebecca Hall) to see something incriminating . . . and it turns out she lives in their neighborhood in South Boston.  Jem wants to deal with her so that she's guaranteed never to testify, but Doug tries his own tactics.  Doug quickly falls for Claire and is caught in the web of his own deceit.

""The Town"" is aptly named, as all the characters are caught up by the lives they have already lived in South Boston, where everybody seems to be either a criminal or in love with one.  The town forces you to make choices, and those choices have lingering consequences.

Beautifully shot, ""The Town"" offers a visual tour of Boston and culminates in a daring shoot-out at Fenway Park.  This is an intelligent piece of filmmaking - we're not talking about ""Point Break:  Boston"" here - and the full cast does the story proud.",1315872000,3,2292,4.6875
4289874,3,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck's second directorial effort following the critically lauded GONE BABY GONE is a mostly well-executed affair, but a disappointing change of direction in its final act lands it in a predictable, unfeasible, and morally ambiguous conclusion.  In the end, it feels that Affleck and company felt more compelled to capture the mood and feel of their beloved Boston locale, rather then see the riveting story through to what should have been a better conclusion.

The film follows a band of thieves who hold up banks and armored trucks with expert precision.  Following the film's first robbery, Affleck's ""Doug"" strikes up a quick relationship with one of the hostages (Rebecca Hall as ""Claire"") in an attempt to ensure she doesn't know enough to tip off the feds.  This he does in an effort to prevent his comrade ""Jem"" (Jeremy Renner) from simply killing her for safety's sake.  The first half of the film allows the tension to build, as we the audience know that Claire can ID a tell-tale tattoo on Jem's neck if she ever sees it, and that Jem will surely kill her the moment he believes her to be a liability.

The problem I have with the film is that the third act takes the film in an altogether different direction, echoing the similar denouement of HEAT, whereby the thugs chase ""one last big score,"" regardless of the feds already nipping at their heels.  This, and the inclusion of another threat from the local drug kingpin that only comes to bear in the final act makes it feel like the script went through re-writes before being committed to film (although it is an adaptation of a novel, so the source material may have followed the same path, I don't know).

Affleck, Renner, and Hall play their roles well, as does Blake Lively as the doped-out sometimes girlfriend and Joe Hamm as the G-man hot on the heels of the thugs.  Affleck's direction is certainly competent, suggesting a possible future with more success behind the camera than in front.  If only the story had stayed on task rather than devolving to the predictable anti-climax, this may have been a much better film.  I never felt the sympathy for the characters that the ending demands.  Many of the decisions by the characters in the final parts of the film felt less honest and more like actions taken to serve the convenience of ending the film arbitrarily.

As it is, the film garnered much critical praise - but one can't help but wonder if this wasn't due more to the surprise to be had in seeing that a veteran actor can also pull off a directorial feat such as this.  Were it a no-name director, the film might have been largely overlooked.

It's certainly not a bad film by any stretch, but some tinkering with the script would have made a better final product.  To see a much better heist film with similar beats, (though lacking the ""Bah-ston"" setting) check out Michael Mann's far superior HEAT.",1315872000,5,2892,4.6857707509881426

They should change the writing on Ben Affleck's Oscar award from best screenplay for Good Will Hunting to jack of all trades for this movie because this is his best work by far. For him to star in this movie, write this movie, and direct this movie is very impressive. This movie is very well written and Ben Affleck has put himself in the discussion along with Clint Eastwood for best lead actor to direct a movie. Affleck does a terrific job playing Doug MacRay, the leader of a Charlestown bank robbing crew. He's also a conflicted man with his feelings for a female bank manager named Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), his loyalty to his best friend and fellow crew member Gem (Jeremy Renner), and wanting to get out of the game for good while dealing with his menacing boss Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite). And Doug also has relentless FBI agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) pursuing him along with the fact his father (Chris Cooper) is incarcerated for life. Doug handles everything well and has a lot going for him, yet he has all these problems to deal with. Affleck executes those aspects of his role to perfection. The rest of the performances are superb as well. Rebecca Hall as Claire, Doug's one source of redemption, brings a lot of emotion to her role. Jon Hamm brings a lot of intensity as FBI Agent Adam Frawley. Jeremy Renner is also intense as Gem, Doug's best friend and fellow crew member. Chris Cooper makes the most of his cameo appearance as Stephen MacRay, Doug's incarcerated father. Pete Postlethwaite is down right intimidating as Fergie. And another standout performance is Blake Lively as Krista, Doug's drug addicted ex-girlfriend and Gem's sister. Lively breaks out of The Gossip Girl routine to show something different and her performance is on par with everyone else's. This movie is a character driven movie and it does a great job of mixing the action in. There are few action scenes, but they blend in well with the plot, they are timely, and well executed. If not for this movie, then ""I'm Not Afraid"" by Eminem would be not in my iPod right now. For those of you who don't know, that song played in the previews for this movie.

4289901,5,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck, not only can you act, you have some serious directorial chops.  Case in point:  THE TOWN, a taunt, tight, violent whirlwind of a movie centering around a gang of robbers in the Charlestown projects of Boston.  Affleck plays Doug MacRay, the leader of the gang; MacRay is a most reluctant robber, tormented and troubled by his violent existence, and when he falls in love with the bank manager of one of his heists (Rebecca Hall, who is stellar in her own right), he realizes it's time to leave his turbulent neighborhood behind--except circumstances won't allow, culminating in a Fenway Park heist that goes tragically awry.

Not only is the cast exceptional, but Affleck moves the viewer through the story, the dialogue, the character interactions, and the streets of Beantown with a rugged authenticity that is staggering.  This film gets up and moves, and the action is as intense as it is mesmerizing.  Kudos to the rest of the cast, including Jon Hamm as a tightly wound FBI agent, Chris Cooper in a brief appearance as MacRay's prison-dwelling father, and Pete Postlethwaite as a gum-chewing, almost creepy, mob boss.  Yet Jeremy Renner stands out handsomely as Jem, MacRay's violent, hot-tempered best friend.  Renner is an up-and-coming superstar, and with the look and feel of THE TOWN, Affleck is one impressive director.

4289902,4,B0049EO108,"I'm not a fan of Ben Affleck as an actor since he has no charisma and tends to be wooden. He single handedly made ""Daredevil"" a terrible movie. That being said, after seeing ""Gone Baby Gone"" and ""The Town"", I'm a big fan of Ben Affleck as a movie maker.

""The Town"" takes a simple premise and makes a movie out of it. A masked bank robber who takes a teller hostage, in order to facilitate an escape, subsequently falls in love with her, which creates some complications. How does he keep the relationship going? Does he tell her the truth? How will the other bank robbers feel about this? How does the FBI feel about their victim romancing their target? All of this is entertaining yet hardly break though cinema.

What elevates this film is Affleck's obvious love and ability to cinematically capture Boston. He has a great feel for the working class, Irish element that is the focus of this movie. He also knows how to balance melodrama with some nice action scenes. The movie is somehow glossy and gritty at the same time.

I love his earlier work ""Gone Baby Gone"" which is less flashy and has more substance than ""The Town"". However, the two filmed-in-Boston movies clearly shows that Affleck is the go to guy when it comes to a Boston-themed flick.

His pacing, narration, and understanding of the demographics makes this a highly entertaining movie and, for me, an eager fan of future works.",1313107200,,1398,4.602409638554217

Outside the park, there's a huge line, with folks waiting to see the stars, and hoping to possibly get a ""golden ticket"" into the event; a massive screen erected in the famous ballpark, with the cityscape of Boston above and around it; free popcorn and drinks for everyone; lots of projection and sound equipment, paparazzi, and all sorts of artsy folks who probably know people, who know people, etc.; and everyone got a free black blanket with THE TOWN (in red) embroidered upon it (it's still in the trunk of my car).

4289915,5,B0049EO108,"While it may take a village to raise a child, if the village in question is Charlestown, MA , the child may very well be trained in the modern guild of bank robbers. ""The Town"", Ben Affleck's second film as a rapidly maturing director in the no nonsense mold of Clint Eastwood, gets it right, from the broad ""a""s that trip naturally from Affleck's tongue to the Notre Dame tattoo which simultaneously adorns and identifies the neck of the Jeremy Renner character. Shot largely on location,""The Town"" uses the people, sports facilities/teams and especially the neighborhood bars and strip joints to create a tribal world of crime and corruption,loyalty and omerta which defines and delimits its characters.
In the past filmmaking decade, blue collar MA has become a favored setting for films as diverse as ""Mystic River"", ""The Departed"", ""Gone Baby Gone"" (Affleck's first directorial effort) and ""The Fighter"". Where ""The Town"" has the edge over the Eastwood and Scorsese efforts, and parallels that of David O. Russell/ Mark Wahlberg, involves the question of home turf. From the time of his Oscar winning ""Good Will Hunting"" script to the present film, Affleck has been most successful when he sticks close to home. Here he expertly directs a superb cast which features ""The Hurt Locker""'s Jeremy Renner (in a performance of deeply unsettling precision and nuance) as the always ready to explode character of the best friend, Blake Lively as the sluttish, drug running and addicted single mother (a direct parallel to the Amy Ryan character in ""Gone Baby Gone"")who was once the Affleck character's girlfriend, Jon Hamm as the tenacious but outplayed FBI agent and Pete Postlethwaite in his valedictory performance as the skeletal but lethal crime boss.
The extended Blu-ray version of ""The Town"" deepens the central relationships between the Affleck and Rebecca Hall characters, bank robber and bank robbery victim/hostage who become lovers, and the Affleck and Renner characters, boyhood chums raised in crime school together. The Blu-ray makes additionally fine use of the city of Charlestown/Boston as a main character and punches up the energy level in the film's two most memorable sequences: the ""nuns with guns"" masked robbery and subsequent chase through the narrow and winding historical streets of Boston's North End and the extended robbery of big game(Yankees) receipts from Fenway Park, the cathedral of baseball. In their scripting and directing, but especially in their sound and visual editing, these parts of ""The Town"" belong in the company of ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Heat"". In general, this Blu-ray's images are vivid and almost palpable, the sound track crisp, deep and rich.

This is a review of the 153-minute extended cut. The theatrical 125-minute version is also included in this Blu-ray presentation.

The movie opens with a robbery, but this is not a heist movie. We don't see how it's planned and we don't know who is involved. It's about the consequences of those actions.

Rebecca Hall plays a bank employee who is taken as a hostage. The robbers get away and release her. I'm saying this without spoilers as it happens at the start of the movie and establishes what is to form the main body of the story.

Affleck is one of the robbers. He checks on Hall to make sure she isn't going to turn them in. They start a relationship.

Renner plays a psycho who loves the power that he gets from being part of the robbery. He wants to kill Hall's character to be safe.

The story is essentially about how the situation is resolved. Who lives, who dies, who gets caught and who escapes. How they see their future.

It's set in Boston in Charlestown, an area of one square mile where it's almost a way of life to commit crimes of this nature. The FBI wants to stop it happening.

This is elevated above many movies of this type. There's a lot of time spent on the characters. How they were brought up and why they do what they do now. It's also about change, or the potential for change. The problems of going through such a transition.

Hall is excellent. I enjoyed her role in Vicky Cristina Barcelona and this performance is just as good. She seems real in this role. Affleck isn't bad either and this stays well within his range. There's also a welcome cameo from Chris Cooper.

The story was better than I expected. I felt like I was there and a part of what was happening.

It does have limitations and takes a long time to give us quite a small amount of information. I will watch it again though. There's very little action, but it fits in well when it happens. The theatrical cut has better pacing and is a better option if your friends prefer action over characterization.",1303689600,,2244,4.522277227722772

4289929,3,B0049EO108,"I tried watching this movie a month or so ago with my teenage boys but my 17 year old wanted to switch because of the constant swearing. Yesterday, I watched the whole thing, but this time alone. This heist story is fast-paced and entertaining, the acting is quite good, and the dialogue is great. Good mix of drama, action, tension, suspense and even some humor.

The film is about a group of robbers, led by Doug McRay, brilliantly played by Ben Affleck, who grew up together on the wrong side of the tracks in Charlestown. Doug falls in love with their hostage, Clair, played by Rebecca Hall, from a heist. The robbers let her go but after discovering that she lives in their neighborhood, Doug tracks her down to make sure she won't talk. That part was somewhat unbelievable because first of all, she didn't see their faces since they were wearing masks, and second of all, since Doug's best friend Jem or James, superbly played by Jeremy Renner, does not hesitate to kill at any other point in the movie, it is somewhat far-fetched that he would just let a hostage go if he had any doubts as to whether she could identify them.

Nethertheless, in the process of following Clair, the somewhat vulnerable and sensitive Doug develops a relationship with her which causes him to question his life of crime. The FBI, already suspicious of her since she is the assistant bank manager and the one who opened the vault for the gang, discovers that she is in contact with Doug which causes them to suspect her even more.

At first, she doesn't know that Doug was involved in the robbery but later finds out through the FBI. The edgy and vicious Jem is not happy to learn that Doug is becoming involved with Clair, and even more unhappy when Doug tells him that he wants to leave his life of crime. But the crime bosses won't let him and threaten him that he has to do another job and of course, this time, it all goes bad. Chris Cooper briefly plays McRay's father who has been sentenced to many life sentences and Jon Hamm the FBI agent who is after the group.

What works well in this movie is that even though MacRay is the bad guy, you end up rooting for him all the way.",1303344000,,2171,4.4335839598997495

4289931,5,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck delivers a hardcore film about bank jobs and crime crews in a town that is filled with them. For movie fans who enjoy bank robbery films, you must add this to your list (or queue). The Town may remind viewers of films like Lookout or Thief with a modern feel. The film doesn't focus too much on the bank robbing side of the plot nor the character drama. However, the viewer is given just enough of both to be able to follow the fast moving plot. Also, the methods used during the bank jobs are interesting and original. Overall it is a good movie in the genre and in general.

Unfortunately, Michaelmatician has not commented on The Town. Allegedly he spoke briefly with Affleck about the film's conclusion as well as the benefits of including grapefruit in one's diet.

His friend Matt Damon has distinguished himself as the leading actor of his day,Affleck has made some wrong choices,but started his own return to form in Hollywoodland. Now he is emerging as a superb director too,maybe his real forte as well as writing will crystallise here.

This suspenseful drama set in a crime thriller. Co-writing,directing and starring,Affleck pulls off an admirable heist movie,nodding to the realistic Wire TV series of gritty,well paced actioners,this is set in a notorious area of Boston,crime capital of America. Four lifelong friends and bank robbers,including Jeremy Renner as a wildcard, impulsive,loose-cannon,who overhits and is trigger-happy,carry out a bank robbery that involves hostage bank manager,Rebecca Hall. They wear skeleton masks(later nuns masks) in a nod to this convention. After she is freed

Doug McCray(Affleck)volunteers to keep tabs on her,to make sure she doesn't know anything about them. He finds love and he sees a ticket out of this way of life. This plot mechanism drives the film forward with McCray avoiding the FBI agent(Jon Hamm)looking to bring his crew down and his brother-in-crime Renner,who won't let him leave due to saving his life in the past,also criminal associates Peter Postlethwaite and co. who threatens to keep McCray in his father's way of life,responsible too for his mother's death.

There are some implausibilities and clichs,the one last job,the whore with the heart of gold,the shoot outs,the misty ending, the criminal who wants out,this is a great cast of good performances,including Chris Cooper as McCray's father,Jon Hamm,showing his worth as well as the phenomenal Renner.

When this film was first released I was all kinds of excited since I am a huge Jeremy Renner and a Ben Affleck fan as well. Add in that not only do I like those two as actors but I thought Affleck's first film ""Gone Baby Gone"" was great. So needless to say that we [my little group of friends and such] really wanted to see this movie and were excited about it. Of course we loved it but I must say that this DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack is great with an extended version. Add in the behind the scenes features and you have one great combo pack.

The story follows a group of Charlestown bank robbers as the FBI is looking into them after a recent successful heist. It turns out that while they did this they took a hostage and after letting her go they wonder if she will be a problem. So Doug MacRay [Affleck] takes on the responsibility of finding out what she knows, she won't recognize him because they robbers were wearing masks [of course]. But has the heat from the FBI increases and Doug's feelings for her grow the rest of the crew becomes restless. The problem being of course is has Doug falls for her he wants even more to get out of the game, but they have one more big job to do.

I have to say that while some of not liked this as much as me I really enjoyed this film and found it to be very well done. I have to give Ben create because I really do like this film and as a writer/director he is really becoming a top guy I the business. As an actor I have always liked him, he has a certain charisma that shines through. Of course my boy Jeremy Renner was excellent in this film as James Coughlin, in fact if Bale had not won the best supporting actor award at the Oscars I would say it would have gone to this man. While he brings a nice intensity to the character I actually see the sympatric side of the character that a lesser actor may not have brought out.

Rebecca Hall does a great job as Ben's love interest Claire and plays a very real character, very well done. Jon Hamm is the FBI guy after the crew and does an excellent job here as well as does every one in the film, very well cast and cast with actual residents of Charlestown. I would also like to point out that Renner spent all his time with actual bank robbers from Charlestown to get the character and the accent down right. Based on a novel called ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan Affleck has proven that even if he wants to leave acting he has a career in filmmaking.

This is one of my favorite films and that may be because I have been following Renner's career since his first film but hey I enjoyed it. I also recommend that you check out Renner in ""Dahmer"" as it is one of the best performances ever. I do highly recommend this film and say go ahead and buy it, skip the rental.

4289937,4,B0049EO108,"In 'The Town,' Ben Affleck proves that 'Gone Baby Gone' wasn't a fluke.  He's a top-notch director.  A couple of years back, he suffered from comparisons to erstwhile equal Matt Damon.  Damon seemed to pick all the right projects (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bourne-Trilogy-The-Bourne-Identity-The-Bourne-Supremacy-The-Bourne-Ultimatum/dp/B001F12J0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bourne Trilogy (The Bourne Identity | The Bourne Supremacy | The Bourne Ultimatum)</a>&nbsp;foremost), while Affleck picked dreadful ones (typified by 'Gigli').  Quietly, he started picking better roles and - more importantly - controlling his own destiny.  His presence is in every corner of The Town: screenplay adapter, director, co-star and pseudo-casting agent (he's responsible for many of the Boston authentics that dot both his films).

It's an excellent film, expertly told.  As a director, Affleck has staged some small, thrilling scenes.  Most notable: a light, casual lunch between Affleck's character and Rebecca Hall's character which suddenly turns taut and mesmerizing when Affleck's buddy (and co-conspirator) Jeremy Renner unexpectedly shows up.

In&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vicky-Cristina-Barcelona/dp/B001DJ7PR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>, everyone talked Cruz, Johansson, Bardem, but it was Rebecca Hall whose performance made that film.  She was incredible.  That happens again here.  You have to believe both her fear (and its after-effects) after the initial robbery and her willingness to be smitten soon after by Affleck's character.  She's the single best thing in the movie.

As an actor, Affleck excels, too.  He plays a criminal with a soft heart, albeit well-hidden.  Hall's character sees this side of him, meaning she's got quite a shock coming when the movie's two plotlines intersect.  Affleck has the inherent sensitivity to pull off this dichotomy.

'The Town' refers to 'Charlestown', once a predominantly Irish-Catholic section of Boston known for criminal activity. Crime apparently reached its apotheosis around 1995 in Charlestown when a series of bank robberies were committed. In more recent times, however, the area has become gentrified and probably most of its residents now would express surprise that Charlestown is currently associated with the serious type of crimes depicted in this film. Nonetheless, the filmmakers advise their audience in the trailer that ""there are over 300 bank robberies in Boston every year"" and ""most of these professionals live in a 1-square-mile neighborhood called Charlestown."" According to Wikipedia, however, there were 23 reported bank robberies in the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the first quarter of 2010. So much for verisimilitude!

'The Town' works best when depicting the dark underside of the criminal underclass in Charlestown (albeit, a depiction that is decidedly anachronistic, as discussed above). My favorite character is 'Fergie', played by the late character actor, Pete Postlethwaite. He's a local crime boss who runs a floral shop as a front for his criminal activities. In perhaps the best scene in the film, Fergie confronts Ben Afleck's 'Doug MacRay', insisting that MacRay participate in the next bank robbery he's got planned, despite the fact that MacRay now wants out. MacRay is practically left speechless when Fergie reveals that years ago, he got MacRay's mother hooked on drugs in retaliation for his father wanting to leave Fergie's gang. The kicker is that the mother committed suicide. Fergie ups the stakes (like all good criminals) when he threatens to kill MacRay's girlfriend, Claire, the sweet bank manager turned hostage. Postlethwaite is perfect as the scraggy-faced long-time tough guy who'll stop at nothing to protect his turf.

There are a few other good things about 'The Town' including the excellent performance of Jeremy Renner as 'Jem', Doug's boyhood friend, who's now Doug's right hand man. Renner is utterly believable as the hot-headed psycho who always wants to take things a step further than Doug, his level-headed comrade in crime. There are also a collection of local Boston characters in the form of armored car guards, police officers and Fenway Park workers, who all show up, adding to the foreboding atmosphere. Blake Lively also acquits herself well as the McRay's jealous ex-girlfriend who can't accept the fact that she's the odd woman out. Should I also mention the first two bank robberies are neatly shot and edited and add to the overall fast pace of the film's narrative?

Unfortunately, a good deal of the rest of 'The Town' is typical Hollywood claptrap, which disqualifies it from being in the same league as that old chestnut, the gritty 1970 crime drama shot in the Boston area, 'The Friends of Eddie Coyle'. At the outset, it doesn't make a lot of sense that Jem decides to take Claire hostage as it soon becomes apparent that she lives in the neighborhood and could perhaps identify one (or all of them) as the perpetrators of the bank robbery.

The hostage 'faux pas' is a necessary contrivance in order to allow Doug to hook up with Claire. Many have criticized Affleck's performance, arguing that he seems out of place as a local boy from Charlestown. Maybe so, but Affleck is really saddled by a script that calls for a character working at complete cross purposes. The screenwriters want us to believe that McCray is on one hand, a bit of a psychopath who doesn't hesitate to join his pals in committing bank robberies where people are killed (although McCray insists he never does any killing himself). But when his chivalrous heart is offended after girlfriend Claire informs him some local bully has been harassing her, he has no qualms in breaking into the apartment of the bully in question and beating this guy (along with psycho buddy Jem), to a bloody pulp. As long as he's doing it for 'a good woman', McCray's violent outbursts are 'justified'.

Rebecca Hall is equally saddled by the film's unconvincing script. In one of the worst scenes in the film, when Jem intrudes on Doug and Claire's luncheon date, no bells and whistles go off in Claire's mind after she meets him. It's quite obvious that Jem is not only from 'the other side of the tracks' but is also thoroughly unsavory, and Claire ends up saying nothing to Doug afterward about him. You would think that that it might occur to good girl Claire that Doug's 'buddy' also puts her new boyfriend in a bad light too. The films' scenarists also lose points when they have Claire and the FBI agents standing at an open window where Doug can easily see that they're forcing her to entice him to her apartment. Hey, how about standing inside the living room, away from the window, where Doug can't draw any definitive conclusions as to whether the FBI is at the apartment or not.

'The Town' wears out its welcome completely in the final (third) bank robbery scene. While the first bank robbery was quick and for the most part fairly believable and the second one featured some comic relief with the gang dressed in Nun masks, the third heist appears to be simply derivative. Doug and Jem simply dress up as cops and rob the payroll room at Fenway Park. There is the obligatory shootout, with Jem doing his 'suicide-by-cop' routine. Meanwhile, Special Agent Frawley, stares mindlessly, as Doug makes his getaway in a cop car, right in front of his eyes. In a nod to the 'Shawshank Redemption', all's well that ends well when Claire digs up the stolen cash in her garden and donates it for the renovation of a local kids' hockey rink.

There you have it. 'The Town' manages to entertain in some respects but ultimately must resort to the tired trappings of the heist genre. It's a mixed bag that should at best, engender mixed reviews!",1300147200,,5929,4.922
4289945,5,B0049EO108,"Years ago a young actor named Ben Affleck soared to super stardom with the critically acclaimed film ""Good Will Hunting"". To follow that up Ben starred in a series of very successful (although not always critically appreciated) blockbusters such as ""Armageddon"", ""Pearl Harbor"", and ""Daredevil"". But after suffering a string of box office disappointments (everyone remembers ""Gigli"", need I say more) Ben disappeared for a brief time from the public eye.

Then in 2006, he re-emerged as a talented dramatic actor in his excellent portrayal of the late George Reeves in ""Hollywoodland"". To which he followed up with his surprisingly brilliant big screen directorial debut with ""Gone Baby Gone"". Since that time, Ben has chosen his projects with much more care, and his most recent directing and acting effort is the stellar heist film, ""The Town"".

""The Town"" is the story of a crew of bank robbers that are as close as brothers and led by the increasingly reluctant Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck). Despite their numerous successful heists, Doug has grown tired of ""the life"", and having fallen for a young woman named Claire (Rebecca Hall) he now has a reason to walk away from not only crime, but his ""brothers"" and the only city he's ever known. However, the more Doug tries to break away, the harder his best friend Jimmy (Jeremy Renner) pulls to keep him around for the proverbial ""one last job""; all the while a seasoned FBI agent (Jon Hamm) is closing in on the crew and time is running out.

With so many heist films having been released over the years it's undoubtedly become difficult for any writer to craft a story that can be considered fresh within this sub-genre. However, the approach this movie takes by allowing the viewer a fly-on-the-wall perspective for every step of the crime gave it a more original feel. Of course, having a solid script and top-notch acting didn't hurt either.

The screenplay written by Peter Craig (first-time screenwriter) and the writing duo behind ""Gone Baby Gone"", Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard, is the perfect blend of intensity, drama, action, and even a little bit of romance. Each facet of this film's story works flawlessly together to create one of the strongest entries into the heist film sub-genre in quite some time.

The story for the entire film was perfectly paced to allow for plenty of character development, along with a natural increase in intensity and/or anxiety prior to the heists. Nothing about the film seemed rushed in order to get to the next job, and the intensity (or anxiety, depending) of each character was shared by the audience throughout the film. Truth be told, drawing an audience in to a movie to such a degree is something that not every film manages to accomplish and to do so is an achievement unto itself.

Guiding the story is director Ben Affleck, who was pulling triple duty on this film serving as co-writer, star, and director. With his directorial work here and in his previous film, ""Gone Baby Gone"", Ben is shaping up to become one of the best directors of his time. Some have even gone on to say that he could be the next Clint Eastwood (in terms of directing), and with that statement I would have to agree.

Ben has now shown that he clearly knows how to execute intense dramatic pieces, and even some well orchestrated action sequences as well. Also, his ability to get top-notch performances from his fellow actors is a testament to how respected he is as a director, despite his past as a media lightning rod.

From Ben's previous film and now to ""The Town"" one can clearly see his incredible talent as a filmmaker, and I for one look forward to seeing what he directs next.

While on the subject of Ben Affleck, let's discuss his performance, along with his costars while we're at it. Leading the ensemble cast, as I've already mentioned, is Ben Affleck, and his performance here is one of his best. Actually, it is probably his absolute best so far, narrowly beating out his terrific job in ""Hollywoodland"".

As Doug MacRay, Ben displays a decidedly darker edge, necessary to lead a crew of thieves, but also a surprisingly gentle nature that values life above all. Whether it is the lives of his fellow crew members or their victims, Doug will go to great lengths to plan his heists with every life taken into account.

On the opposite side of that coin is Jeremy Renner's character and Doug's best friend, Jimmy. Jeremy who is no stranger to an excellent performance (see him in ""The Hurt Locker"" for further evidence) truly earned his Academy Award nomination with his fiercely malevolent portrayal. In this role, Jeremy is almost unrecognizable from his Boston accent to his physical appearance to his downright evil nature, this character is as much of a departure from his role in the aforementioned as one can possibly get, and he excels in it at every turn.

In the other primary supporting roles we find even more incredible performances, including one I found to be very surprising. First off, is actor Jon Hamm who has found himself with an incredible surge in his career with a terrific performance in this film coupled with his continued success on AMC's ""Mad Men"". I find myself perplexed by the fact that Jon hasn't been more prominent in feature films prior to this one, a problem that I believe will likely be remedied from now on.

As the lead FBI agent tracking Doug and his crew, Jon exudes authority and strength every step of the way, and an intensity that reveals a man consumed by his work. Jon had moments in the film where he could have played the role more over-the-top and borderline maniacal in his quest for justice, but Jon played everything believably and never once made a moment feel forced.

Serving as Ben's love interest is actress Rebecca Hall (""Frost/Nixon"") who is not the most recognizable of actresses out there, but soon could be with performances like this one. Her performance was incredibly raw in its emotional punch, yet with an inner strength that belied her character's troubled life.

As the most surprising cast member in terms of performance is actress Blake Lively (TV's ""Gossip Girl"") as Doug's off-and-on ""friend with benefits"". Blake's performance as a drug addicted, possibly abused, single mother is unexpectedly profound given that I always felt she seemed like just another pretty face that couldn't act for anything. I now stand corrected, and if her future performances carry as much weight as this one then she will definitely be one to watch.

Lastly, are two always amazing and top-notch character actors that only appear for a short time in this film, Chris Cooper (""The Bourne Identity"") and Pete Postlethwaite (""Inception""). Despite their lack of screen time, both actors make the absolute most of there scenes and deliver terrific performances as well. Typically when actors of their caliber are placed in such small roles, I would have felt disappointed that their talents were used for so little. However, in this film, I think their brief appearances were appropriately limited and served the movie perfectly.

Sadly, the ever-reliable Pete Postlethwaite passed away a month or so ago, but at least he got to appear in two of the best films of 2010, ""Inception"" and of course, ""The Town"". He was never the most well-known of actors, at least not by name, but whenever you would see him in a movie you would always recognize him and know that his would be a performance to watch.

In the end, boasting incredible performances from the entire cast and a terrific story, ""The Town"" is a taut, intense heist thriller that is expertly handled from start to finish courtesy of director, co-writer, and star Ben Affleck. This movie was essentially the shot of adrenaline that was needed to reinvigorate this increasingly generic sub-genre of cinema.

4289946,4,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck's second directorial effort is based on the novel Prince of Thieves by Chuck Hogan, with a screenplay by Peter Craig, Affleck, and Aaron Stockard, who co-wrote the screenplay for Affleck's first film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-Baby-Gone/dp/B0010ZR160/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone Baby Gone</a>. Taking place in Boston, an area which Affleck is quite familiar with, The Town is a heist movie that has been inevitably compared to Heat with few mentioning how it compares to recent ventures into the ""heist"" sub-genre. In comparison to most of the mindless, non-stop action heist movies that have been released in the last few years, The Town is a welcome return to the heist films that had both story and characters that were more than mere pawns of the screenplay. As a whole, The Town is a terrific, though imperfect film expertly handled by its unlikely director who has proven himself a worthy director with his two films.

""One blue-collar Boston neighborhood has produced more bank robbers and armored car thieves than anywhere in the world. Charlestown."" While I can't testify to the accuracy of this, the film's opening title card sets the stage for what's in store and the opening scene puts us right into the middle of a bank robbery, where the robbers expertly infiltrate the bank and make off with the money and a hostage named Claire (Rebecca Hall). The robbers are lead by the level-headed Doug MacRay (Affleck), although commissioned and basically controlled by the florist, Fergie Colm (the late Pete Postlethwaite). The group is paranoid about the wild-card in their group James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), who was responsible for the kidnapping during the robbery and now may need to tie up loose ends when he finds that their hostage lives only a few blocks from them. With their latest job attracting the attention of the F.B.I. and the driven F.B.I. agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), Doug offers to make sure the girl is not a threat. This sets up an unlikely relationship between the former hostage and her kidnapper.

Whether you've been to Boston or not, it's clear that Affleck knows the rhythm and the language of the area very well and his Boston-setting is almost a character itself. While Affleck's acting career soured in the early 2000s due to a string of high-profile flops, it's clear this Boston setting he's in his element both as an actor and director. The Town is a dramatic heist film, certainly not the first of its kind, yet Affleck handles the material with both confidence and skill. With bits of drama, action, romance, and even some humor, Affleck handles these elements capably by establishing strong, distinct characters whose decisions seem natural and not just fueled by what the script requires of them. The heist sequences are tense, exciting, and intelligently executed without sacrificing the story and characters for mindless action. Even the exaggerated masks that are used lend to the tone established and make the scenes more memorable, despite not bringing anything new to the sub-genre. Making its setting such an integral part of the story would not succeed without a strong cast and Affleck has assembled a cast that elevates already strong material.

Affleck and Renner, the latter of whom received a Best Supporting Oscar nomination for his role, brilliantly contrast each other with Renner playing a despicable psychopath allowing a more extroverted, attention-garnering role and Affleck playing the good-hearted, introverted role that tends to garner less acclaim. It's obvious that Affleck's ability as an actor has matured quite gracefully over the last few years and he proves to be an impressive force here. With what seems to be a renewed passion for his craft and the freedom to play by his own rules, he brings both depth and a disarming charm to his role as Doug. Displaying both confidence and vulnerability, he's presents himself as an actor ready to be taken seriously again. Meanwhile, Jeremy Renner manages to upstage nearly everyone with his great performance. A far cry from his role in The Hurt Locker that thrust him into recognition, Renner marvelously alternates between intensely charming and venomous, depending on what the moment calls for. His character is dangerous and unpredictable which Renner makes wholly believable while adding an acute sense of humanity as well. Few performances of this sort are as convincing as Renner's here; you wouldn't want to mess with him and you can see him ready to snap at any moment, yet you feel empathy for him as well. Hamm, Hall, Postlethwaite, Slaine, Blake Lively, and Chris Cooper all do some great work as well, making this a true ensemble effort. As an actor, Affleck knows how to work with actors and he gets impressive the best from all involved.

Quite simply, The Town is fast-paced, very entertaining, and (best of all) well-made. It's not a masterpiece, although I'd be troubled to go on about its imperfections at any great length and Affleck is proving himself to be an impressive filmmaker who has crafted a heist film that stands alongside the few great/really good films of this genre. He tackles his film with passion, energy, and vision proving once-and-for-all that he's worth taking seriously and reassessing. The Town may not be his masterpiece, but it's got me excited for what he'll bring to the film world in the future.

4289949,5,B0049EO108,"THE TOWN is a film you've seen a million times before, but executed so sharply it feels new and fresh all over again.  Ben Affleck wasn't the best choice to play the leading role, a hardened criminal with a speck of decency left in him, but he looks for the unusual sides of the character and finds them.  In a way his role is more difficult than that of the freak Jeremy Renner is playing, where all he has to do is rave and look inhuman and menacing.  Affleck must seem to be growing and changing, as he encounters the beautiful bank manager played by the gorgeous Rebecca Hall.  Somehow she allows him to be a way he has never let himself be before, and he lets his defenses down when he's with her.

Of course the whole romance feels doomed, because we know that somewhere down the line she is going to discovered that Doug is among the gang of foolishly dressed robbers who held her hostage during a brutal armed robbery.

That is the Damocles' sword that propels the tension of the movie.  But there are other sources of tension too, including the presence of beautiful, beatup Blake Lively, who plays the sister of Jeremy Renner, the former girlfriend of Ben Affleck, and the mother of a young child she often deserts in order to carry out her job as runner for an Oxcontin ring.  Blake Lively is great as Serena in GOSSIP GIRL, but until you seen her here you might think she's got willful debutante under her belt and that's all she is.  In her Gloria Grahame role here she knocked me out.  The gossips claim that behind the scenes, she made trouble for Ben Affleck's marriage and watching some of her scenes I can see why!  Both the leading ladies in this film are exemplary and it made me think of how solidly director Affleck elicited strong performances from the women in his previous directorial effort, GONE BABY GONE, in which Michelle Monaghan and Amy Ryan were both really ""on.""  And here Hall and Lively are even better, so what does that tell you?  Maybe Affleck is the new George Cukor!",1299888000,,2007,4.450819672131147
4289950,4,B0049EO108,"Well, there is some talk in this film. There is a tender, albeit somewhat unlikely romance that entails moments of quiet conversation. But for the most part, this is a shoot-`em-up that's set, not in the Wild West, but on the mean streets of Boston. As this crew of bank robbers follow in the presumed tradition of their Charlestown section of Boston and make their living by robbing banks - the bullets fly and the blood spatters. Whatever became of just slipping a note to the teller?

So the violence shown here is rather unlikely. Rarely does even one bank robbery involve so much fire power. It would be rarer yet for a neighborhood to experience a series of bank robberies involving such exchanges of projectiles from heavy artillery. But then this is the movies, and we know we have to be prepared to suspend disbelief.

Actually, the robbery and retribution scenes in ""The Town"" have the quality of a violent video game. For whole sections, it's non-stop gun-fire. An adversary will pop-up and be greeted with blasts of bullets. If I had a dollar for every time someone blew someone else's head off - I'd have more than paid for this DVD.

I personally prefer to learn something from movies about bank hold-ups. I want to be in on the planning and process of pulling off such crimes. For example, we're told the robbers in ""The Town"" disabled phone communication from one targeted bank by ""going into the corner junction box."" I would have liked more details about just how this was accomplished.

I craved even more minutiae of process. I wanted to know where the robbers bought those eerie masks they used. You'd have thought the police could have traced the robbers merely by finding the supplier of those uniquely frightening wizened nun costumes. You don't see such outfits sold at any Halloween store. They must have been custom-made. Instead of just being in on the kills, I would have liked to follow Ben Affleck and the others as they found a supplier of such masks and accessorized themselves accordingly. That would have been Seinfeld-serious fascinating to me.

But if you are action-oriented, this is the movie for you. It has slick production values, good acting, and the violence, as improbable as it is, is well choreographed and arresting.",1299628800,,2264,4.780051150895141

In the beginning, the film makes a (somewhat exaggerated) claim about the vast number of bank robbers who come from this small part of Boston, and that it is a profession that is passed on from father to son. Doug MacRay, played by Ben Afleck, is a career criminal who has come up within this environment. He is quite good at what he does and he is quite close to the other members of his gang--they are like family--yet he is conflicted about being a bank robber. His conflict solidifies to the point that he absolutely wants out after he develops a love interest in a young woman who is a bank manager at a bank which, unknown to her, he has just robbed. Through this relationship, as well as his relationship with his imprisoned father and the contrast with the character Jem, the humanity of ""Dougy"" is revealed. I also found it interesting to learn more about his family and background as the film progressed. In the end, Doug is pressed to participate in one last heist, of none other than Fenway Park, and things get very dicey. Some astute detective work from the FBI headed by Jon Hamm as Special Agent Adam Frawley brings them to a confrontation at Fenway, which complicates things. Will they will get away with the crime, and will Doug will get away from ""The Town"", as he wishes, and what will happen with his ""tuney"" (yuppie) girlfriend?

This is an excellent movie.  The characters are compelling and sympathetic and the script is fast-paced and intensely exciting.  Affleck co-wrote and directed this tale of Charlestown, Boston, an area famous for its high percentage of deadly criminals.  He captures the toughness and desperation of its inhabitants and the viewer  feels a connection to the place and the people.  Affleck is very good in his part and Jeremy Renner, who plays Doug's loyal but vicious buddy, was rightly nominated for Best Supporting Actor.  The wonderful Chris Cooper has a small part as Doug's convict father.

The movie is full of brutal gunplay, car crashes, and bad language and still manages to portray Doug's sensitive side and have him emerge as a kind of hero.

This movie is not different its action, drama, suspense all in one. Its about a group of friends who rob banks in Mass. The two standout performances in my view Go to Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner, their roles were very in depth emotionally and they delivered on the roles. Ben Affleck's character falls for a girl whom was involved in one of the robbery, he begins to feel remorse,saddness, regret and anger sorrounding the events hes partaken in. This was one of the best movies ive seen in regards to an Affleck film. When It comes down to it I highly recommened this movie to anyone, I feel they will be surprised and amused by it. At points it will get your emotions going whether sad, angry, nervous for the characters you really get into it. Go Blu Ray with this movie over dvd the shooting, chase and all around sound and picture will suit the film better on it.

4289962,5,B0049EO108,"At first glance this would NOT have been a movie I'd be interested in. Robbery, violence...no thanks. Once I discovered Ben Affleck was in it, that changed everything.

THE TOWN was nothing short of amazing. Great acting. Great action. A great story to be told. And there was even a bit of romance for the romantic at heart like me.

This movie will take you on a journey into the world of criminal life. One that many of us can't begin to phantom what's entailed. It was equally scary on a realistic level as well as painfully heart breaking. What some people are born into is nothing short of horrific.

Doug is trapped in a world he realizes he no longer wants to be a part of. The only problem is he's not allowed to depart from it. Along the way he makes a few discoveries, falls in love, and wants a new life...to make something of himself.

It's heart wrenchingly sad to see one trapped in a life they no longer want to be a part of. Though very much the bad guy, your heart will bleed for Doug, as you cry out for him to survive so he can have an opportunity to change his life around.

This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. There wasn't a thing I'd change, it was so well thought out with outstanding acting, and a remarkable message of hope and love that will have you thinking of THE TOWN well after it's ended.",1298332800,,1335,4.219607843137255

The acting was unconvincing in other ways, too, as if neighbors getting together and making a play.  The F bomb was dropped every two seconds like seventh graders, but I didn't feel any of the grit you would really find in the city.  So many machine guns fired but nobody was hit! When ""Doug"" says ""Let me explain!""  What was he going to explain??  Luckily the girl says, ""No, Leave!""  so he doesn't have to say anything!! Instead he just backs away out the door.  And then there she is again in that damn pea patch.  And oops! I guess she just decided to quit her job as bank manager.  Not to mention the whole morality issues in this movie.  The main character is somehow supposed to be a ""good guy"" but he's NOT a good guy! You can't just beat people with pipes and shoot them with machine guns over and over and rob so many banks and be a good guy just because your mother left you when you were 6  and you gifted a skating rink with the stolen money!  The whole movie just got on my nerves.  I don't understand it's being so well acclaimed.  I just don't get it. I didn't like it at all!",1298246400,15,1215,4.110638297872341

Yes, there is increasing evidence that ""criminal minds"" have a genetic basis.  However crime is often family and culturally determined.  In some communities it is difficult to escape and complicated by drug dependence, parental abandonment and bonds with bad mentors.  Criminals both in and out of prison are as likely to watch this movie as anything else outside the porn genre.  The film is bringing an important commentary to that audience as well.

The car chases and gunfights in the streets of Boston were the only stretch.  Hard to believe for anyone who has driven in the congestion and narrow streets.  Foot chases, better.

I greatly admire the Novelist and Mr. Affleck, the assembled actors  AND...I wish I could personally apologize to Mr. Affleck for that really weird interviewer from Time Magazine's 10 Questions.  I thought I was watching an SNL sketch.",1298246400,,1088,5.011173184357542

4289967,3,B0049EO108,"I'm not a fan of bank robbery movies, but The Town got 94% on Rotten Tomatoes so I figured something must really set it apart from other bank robbery movies. Wrong. There's nothing bad about The Town. It's well-made and well-acted. But who cares? It's just another bank robbery movie, with one new element. The one new element is that one of the bank robbers (Ben Affleck) takes a liking to a potential witness (Rebecca Hall) after ""accidentally"" running into her so he can find out how much she knows. Yet, there are so many elements that, if you're older, you've seen in other movies, you won't be able to stop thinking of them. There are the nuns' outfits with the presidents' faces. There's the loyal friend who once saved Ben's life, who now thinks Ben owes him. There's the desire to get out of the business completely, but being forced to make one last heist. There's the level-headed leader of the gang with the out-of-control underlings. There's the idea that you have to be able to walk away from a bad situation. The list of regurgitated elements goes on and on and on. The Town is a good showcase of Affleck's skills as a director, but that's what it seems like: an exercise. If you've seen Heat, skip this. If you haven't, see Heat first, then skip this. Only if you're a rabid bank robbery movie fan or rabid fan of one of the elements involved will this be worth your time.

Another film this movie regurgitates elements from and that I liked more was Point Break. See Point Break and Heat, then see if The Town is worth your time.",1298073600,2,1546,4.4822695035460995

4289969,4,B0049EO108,"It seems to me that Ben Affleck, who has been underrated as an actor, redeemed himself with his directorial debut of 2007's GONE, BABY, GONE - and now has proven he is not a one-hit wonder with 2010's THE TOWN. Packed with authentic locations (the rough Charlestown section of Boston), car chases, and rich characters - and mixed with a great story and excellent performances, Affleck just might end up with a hit on his hands. He plays Doug MacRay, a former professional hockey prospect who has turned to crime, namely bank robberies; Rebecca Hall is Claire, Doug's wholesome love interest; and Jeremy Renner is loose canon and Doug's best friend from the neighborhood, James (Gem) Coughlin. Supporting these stars are Chris Cooper as Doug's incarcerated father, Blake Lively as James' drug-addicted sister, and Jon Hamm as the FBI agent who is in hot pursuit. Although this film could sink into cliched Boston bad-guy stereotypes and overly emphasized accents, it doesn't. It feels real and the characters, who are likable and engaging, seem like regular folks, albeit criminals. If you enjoyed the action and suspense of THE DEPARTED with Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, you will surely find THE TOWN to be in the same class - in this case, a sophisticated heist thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat!",1297987200,,1321,4.901785714285714

4289971,4,B0049EO108,"I was harsh with Ben Affleck and his directorial debut, `Gone Baby Gone'.  After reflection, maybe I was a tad too harsh (although the film is still far from anything truly inspired).  That said, one thing I did find commendable in his debut was, well, his direction, which was sharp and thrilling to say the least.  With `The Town', his sophomore effort, Affleck proves that his greatest asset is his knack for creating a riveting film, despite obvious flaws and drawbacks.

I don't think it would be too far fetched to presume Ben Affleck will win an Oscar in the near future for direction; ala Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson and Robert Redford (you know, those other popular actors who never could `act' their way to an Oscar).

Thrusting a little more weight on his shoulders this go around, Ben Affleck not only directs but co-writes and co-stars in this crime thriller that piles on the clich&eacute;s while maintaining a slick and engrossing presence.  The film centers on a Boston thug named Doug MacRay.  Doug and his longtime friends make their money robbing banks.  On the outset of the film, Doug and his posse rob a bank and, when Doug's friend Jem loses his head, they wind up with a hostage.  That hostage is bank manager Claire.  Claire is obviously petrified, but that fear doesn't leave her when the whole episode is over.  She carries the burden with her.  When Jem decides he wants her out of the picture entirely, Doug takes it upon himself and make sure she isn't going to rat them out.  He does this by falling in love with her.  Unfortunately, the cops trailing Doug are smart enough to erode this newfound relationship and use it to their advantage.  Couple that with the fact that Doug's `friends' won't let him just walk away from their way of life and you have major problems for Doug and his perilous search for redemption.

The film's premise and script are littered with holes and clich&eacute; ridden errors that keep the film from being anything truly spectacular.  The dynamics between Claire and Doug and believable in chemistry alone, but their relationship is beyond illogical.  The friendships and loyalties boil down to recklessness and don't carry any true weight because the film isn't beyond turning every character into a liar.  The ensemble cast has received a lot of praise but in all honesty there is really only one performance that actually stands out as heartfelt, and that is Rebecca Hall.  Sure, the character is sadly underwritten in areas (it could have been a drag-down, knockout, Oscar winning piece of work had it had a little more color) but she makes so much out of it.  It bothers me that Jeremy Renner's serviceable performance stole all the media attention.

Really though, this film lives and breathes in the hands of Ben Affleck and his directorial choices.  The film is just so alive.  He really knows how to make every frame sing, and he creates such body out of every surface he films.  The thrills all feel legitimate.  He makes the standard (and overdone) car chase seem fresh and exciting.  He created so many layers out of a script that was, at times, layerless.  It is really a commendable piece of work and one that I think truly deserves the attention and praise it can garner.

He has a skill, and I can't wait to see him fine-tune it even more.",1297641600,,3314,4.694974003466204

4289975,3,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck seems to be building a director's career of crime thrillers based in his native Massachusetts. ""The Town"", like ""Gone Baby Gone"", is based on a novel: ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan. Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is a career bank robber in the employ of an Irish gangster in Charlestown, Massachusetts. In the commission of a bank robbery, Doug's volatile partner Jim Coughlin (Jeremy Renner) impulsively takes the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage. She is released unharmed, but, when Ben follows up to see if she knows anything that could incriminate them, he falls head over heels for Claire. Meanwhile, Jim is becoming increasingly violent, and both he and their vicious employer Fergie Colm (Pete Postlethwaite) are pressuring Doug to take on jobs that he would rather not.

""The Town"" benefits from Ben Affleck's natural affinity with the Irish-Massachusetts working class milieu, but neither characters nor plot are engaging. The film runs over 2 hours and begs to be edited more tightly. Affleck's performance is a bit flat, and dialogue is frequently unnatural. Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), the FBI Agent working on the case, sounds like he can barely get the words out. Jon Hamm doesn't have much to do here, but he is conspicuously leading man material, not suited to a wooden supporting character. Had he and Affleck switched roles, both characters would have come off better. Pete Postlethwaite and Blake Lively are very good as Fergie and Jim's sister Krista, respectively. Those characters are essentially caricatures, but they do make a strong impression. Rebecca Hall is also appealing. But these actors can't make up for an overlong, tedious film.",1297382400,,1689,5.141818181818182

4289977,4,B0049EO108,"After a bank robbery he pulled off with his three lifelong friends, Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) from the tough street of Charlestown, Boston, meets Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), another Charlestown resident. Actually Claire was the manager of the bank they robbed, and they took her as hostage (blindfolded before releasing unharmed) the other day. Not knowing his true identity, Claire starts dating Doug - and Doug dreams of starting a new life - when he is given another assignment to undertake. And the FBI led the agent Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm) is closing in on the robbers.

The strength of Ben Affleck-directed ""The Town,"" however, lies not in this romantic part, which I think is weaker than compared to the drama involving male characters. Jeremy Renner as Doug's friend James ""Jem"" Coughlin, a gang member readier to use violence, and Pete Postlethwaite as Fergie ""the Florist"" deliver standout performances. Blake Lively is also very good as Doug's former lover.

The film is often brutal without showing much blood. The car chases (that take place in the narrow streets) are gripping without using special effects. The slick action sequences are proof of Ben Affleck's talent as director. The locations such as Fenway Park are effectively used as the backdrop for action scenes.

I found ""The Town"" was a gripping experience, but while watching that, I couldn't shake off the impression that I had seen it somewhere else. Maybe it was a certain Michael Mann film or something else. With all fine acting and well-executed action sequences, ""The Town"" did not reinvent the genre.

I am neither a 100% lover or hater of him or his films.  He's done some excellent work that can be considered amongst the classics and some ""not so excellent"" work that is at times, down right embarrassing.

I will say that I thought his directorial debut in Gone Baby Gone was absolutely masterful.  The storyline, pacing, casting, acting and character development were all brilliantly executed in my opinion, (despite the fact that it did not necessarily receive great reviews).

So go figure, when I read most of the reviews for this movie singing its' praises and objecting to those who compare it to Heat, I nearly just said forget it and purchased this without viewing it for myself.  All I can say is, I am so glad I rented this one first.  How can anyone who has seen Heat not feel like this movie is almost a complete rip off?

PLOT SPOILERS

There's the gang of four who specialize in bank heists.  There's the older/wise middle man who helps set up the jobs.  There's the famously unattached leader who all of a sudden finds himself in love and wants to run away from his current life alongside his new found love.  There's the loyal ""gang member"" who tells him he really needs the money.  There's the relentless cop who will stop at nothing to get his man and seems to know just the right punches to pull at just the right time. Then, the ultimate coup de grace.  There's the perfectly planned caper spoiled RIGHT at the last second when a tip puts the cops at the scene of the crime just as it's getting to the finish line.  I could go on, but those highlights really cover enough.

END SPOILERS

And this is coming from someone who loved Ben's first movie and really wanted to like this one too.  I mean come on Ben, did you not see Heat?  If anyone watching this movie didn't see Heat, then this could probably/possibly be a pretty good movie for you.  Even though there wasn't a lot of character development and chemistry between the cast members, the story moves along O.K. and there are very few out and out bad scenes.

Otherwise, for those of you who take objection to the Heat comparisons, add me to the list of people whose reviews you don't like.  Because this was an extremely disappointing, derivative movie that left me feeling totally empty at the end.

I found myself so caught up in the film, I was fearful for the safety of the assistant bank manager who becomes Affleck's girl friend; worrying that if she ever successfully identified Affleck as the bank robber, then Affleck's buddy (Jeremy Renner) would probably end up killing her.

I hope Affleck continues to write and direct movies, he seems to be good at it.  Also, his acting, which was extremely annoying for so long, has matured to the point where he is okay on the screen (although he's still not what I would call a great actor). The Town is gripping, tense stuff, very nicely done.  However, as one reviewer on this site pointed out, ""The Town"" would have been a lot better if he hadn't seen ""Heat"" first.  The Town is really good, but Heat is a total classic.",1296691200,,1073,4.591623036649215

- The shooting and car-chasing scenes are suspenseful and engaging.

- The hot-headed character played by Jeremy Renner delivered some sudden suspense. For example, in the scene where he first met Rebecca sitting with Ben on the side-walk caf. It's very convincing.

THE BAD

- I can see no love chemistry between Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall. Yes, they said they loved each other but I did not feel it.

- There was one big logical hole: The FBI agent was so easily outwitted by Ben with a simple trick.

4289997,3,B0049EO108,"After his success directing the gritty and absorbing 2007 GONE BABY GONE, Ben Affleck's next directorial feature was this over-the-top heist fantasy that's supposed to be in a similar milieu (working class Boston) but which is more of a fantasy thriller. Affleck plays Doug Macray, a handsome working stiff from deepest darkest Charlestown, the notorious crime-ridden neighborhood of Boston around the Bunker Hill Monument; with a father (Chris Cooper) serving multiple life terms in prison and a friend-who-is-all-but-a-brother (Jeremy Renner) pressuring him, he has no choice but to take to the mean streets and rob armored cars and banks in the streets of Boston and Cambridge. But if the cheap pubs and overripe Boston accents suggest realism, the film veers wildly from realism in its portraying of the superheists that Doug plans with the supergenius criminal planning of a Thomas Crown or a Lex Luthor. Constantly changing elaborate disguises and foreseeing every eventuality to the smallest detail, Doug's gang has the FBI (led by Jon Hamm) completely buffaloed, which Doug (a decent sort deep down, of course) falls madly in love, surreptitiously, with a tasteful, accentless bank manager (Rebecca Hall) he in disguise previously took hostage in a heist, and who represents A Better Life for Affleck's character. But (of course), just when he thought he was out, they keep pullin' him back in...

There aren't many heist and gangster movie cliches this film ever avoids, but, mysteriously, critics have taken it very seriously, probably because of the adrenaline charge that Doug's fancy heists admittedly provide. Jeremy Renner is effective in his turn as a mean little thug who starts out like Joe Pesci in GOODFELLAS but by the end is more like the crazed Jimmy Cagney at the end of WHITE HEAT; Affleck himself is quite good in his ridiculous role; and poor Jon Hamm has to wrestle with phrases the screenwriters seem to have trotted out to allow him to flaunt a faux-Boston accent (one of his choicer lines entails both the phrases ""Star Market"" and ""a roll of quarters"").

They're smart and good at what they do--until Ben Affleck's character falls for the bank manager they rob. Wanting to leave his criminal past behind him, he appeals to his cohorts, who refuse to let him get away before pulling off one last job. Commitment to friends becomes compromised with his developing love for the bank manager, and the authorities, in the form of Jon Hamm as an FBI agent and the always underappreciated Titus Welliver as a Boston PD detective, begin closing in. The story is smart and well-developed, and the action sequences are explosive and exciting.

4290001,4,B0049EO108,"The Town was one of the best films of 2010 and given the large number of solid films, especially in the second half of the year when The Town came out, that is saying something.  What I did like is that Ben Affleck the director lets each of these actors play to their strengths so that we are seeing to a large degree Jeremy Renner's performance in Hurt Locker again and we're seeing Jon Hamm channel Don Draper into his role.  I think this is also a great way for Pete Postlethwaite to go out.  His quite menace is amazing.

I can only offer two things that keep this from being 5 stars.  The first is that Ben Affleck as an actor just can not hold his weight with this crowd. He comes across as wooden and stiff and it's obvious that the great performances of others is pulling him along. He needs to stick to directing.  Also, speaking as a native of Boston, I have to say the North End and Fenway Park robberies border on the almost comic. I don't hold it against the film it's one of those things you have to let go to enjoy the film but I did laugh at how they were driving in the North End.

The Town returns to Affleck's roots of Boston and delivers a very good crime drama with some interesting sub plots. I found this film very engrossing, but not perfect.

While lacking the emotional resonance of his first film, The Town still manages to make you care for the characters while providing some of the best action sequences of the year. The film hits all the expected beats - there's really nothing new here; but damn, it's well done. One of the better films this year.

Whether he can direct or not remains to be seen.

The Town shows some good signs and some glaring holes.

What he does well are the action scenes.  He also selected a really good premise, gritty, tough Irish neighborhood where band robbery is a cottage industry.  In any movie this is half the battle.

Where he sucks is in character development and capturing the ambience of this Boston neighborhood.

The female lead, that tall rangy actress whose name I always fail to remember is two dimensional and we have no idea why she would walk out and her job as a bank manager and start hanging out in what looks like a community garden with a bunch of munchkins.  What in the hell is she doing there anyway?  Ben's character is a little too noble as are his friends, who at the end of the day are bank robbers who kill people without a second thought.  There is also some slutty blond that hangs around inferring the child she has in tow is Ben's.  What in the hell is that about?  Don't any of these characters have a back story that is worth more than two sentences?

The neighborhood comes off as too pretty and as a great place to live when he should strive to show the random violence, hopelessness and grinding poverty of the place.

However, like I said, the action scenes are first rate but unfortunately are not enough to sustain the movie.

4290010,5,B0049EO108,"If the previous reviewer 'Dave' was familiar with plot structure, he would realize that the similarity to Heat is mostly aesthetic, and any similarities to The Departed are uh... there are none. Other than the fact that it's about Irish criminals in Boston. Kind of like the way Valkyrie and Inglourious Basterds are 'basically the same movie' because they're both about a plot to kill Hitler...

The Town is a thrilling and dramatic crime picture, with great acting, directed by a steller artist. The critical praise is well deserved. It's a character focused piece, with some stunning action set pieces, and great realistic Boston-Irish atmosphere. There is one scene in this that got me so tense in the theatre that... well that actually happened, that never happens to me! Affleck knows how to build tension, is what I'm saying.

Shades of 'Heat' are surreal, but practically subconscious, they are entirely different movies. If you can get over VERY superficial similarities (bank robberies, some of the costumes, the realism) and look at the finer points that make Ben Affleck's film unique you will not ruin your experience with this one.

Next time I would suggest that Dave actually watch the three movies he is comparing before comparing them.

I don't want to give away the plot, and there will be plenty of synopsis in the future I'm sure. If the worst you can say is 'It reminds me of other crime epics, and most people say it's good.'

4290014,4,B0049EO108,"I like Ben Affleck enough but as an actor he seems to have a knack for showing up in more than his share of lousy movies. As a director, however, he's two for two.

I liked ""Gone Baby Gone"" a lot. I liked the story, the characters, the depiction of life in that part of Boston. It had a smart script and it all felt very real to me. ""The Town"" might not be quite as good but the problems lie more in the script than the direction.

It deals with the Charlestown section of Boston and some successful buddy, bank/ armored car robbers. Their most recent heist ends up requiring them to take a female hostage. She's let go but Affleck is sent to assess if she is a problem or not and neutralize her if necessary. He ends up falling for her and that, plus the FBI and some other unforeseen things, puts Affleck in a seemingly no win situation. Can he beat the FBI, beat the bad guys, get the money and get the girl?

This is an old story. It doesn't hold the surprises enjoyed by ""Gone Baby Gone."" The viewer can pretty much tell where things are going. It's really just finding out how the loose ends are going to be resolved. That is really the only 'so-so' aspect of this project. The story is time worn but the particulars are handled well. Jon Hamm plays a good FBI man. He's smart, tough and he knows what buttons to push with what people to get what he wants. Jeremy Renner is always good and this roll is no exception. He plays a scumbag but not one that's two dimensional. He has a sense of loyalty to his pals as do they all. They've grown up together. Done a handful of jobs together and would do time for one another. Peter Postlethwaite (may he rest in peace) chews on his roll with vigor. The other rolls are good but too many to mention here.

Affleck's direction is assured. Like ""Gone Baby Gone"" he has a good sense of things. I never felt the camera was someplace it shouldn't be. For someone from California he has a good sense of the location. The bars, apartments, etc. all feel right. Some complain that it's too long but it clocks in under two hours which didn't bother me in the least.

The plot wasn't contrived and felt organic.  Similarly, the plot progression was very natural in the chaotic way that is true life.  You didn't quite know what was coming but when you arrived you had that ""it felt right"" feeling.

The incomplete story lines were completed.

A classic tale of being a product of one's environment, this film looks deeply and profoundly into the difficulty of extricating oneself out of the only world one knows, and Afflect does a superb job throughout the film of expressing the angst and frustration of being implanted at birth into a hell hole. It's done well, and none of those restraining forces that typically keep residents glued to the place they are born into are neglected, with friends, indebtedness, women, and tradition combining to keep the would be self reformer from accomplishing his life change efforts.

4290032,1,B0049EO108,"Overall Summary:

I exerted the least amount of force I possibly could by clicking my remote and downloading this movie to my TV and it was still a waste of my energy. Unless you're an Affleck fan or a city of Boston fan, I don't recommend renting this movie.  There are much better crime/police thrillers. Watch Out of Sight, The Usual Suspects, or Heat again instead.

Details:

I saw an interview where Affleck said he actually talked to Charlestown inmates and so I was interested to see this film.  I expected some authentic perspective about bank robberies, the people who plan them and how they are executed.  Sorry, there is very little of that and whenever it comes up and the movie starts getting interesting...it goes away quickly.

The Town has an identity crisis, it doesn't know whether it wants to be a gritty crime thriller or a sweet love story.  I think someone must have pitched it as the perfect date movie but unfortunately, it doesn't do either very well.  This is because The Town would rather take large chunks of time for heavy handed and cliched dialogue scenes that seem to go on forever.  I mean seriously, at one point there is a violin playing when the main character is walking into prison to see his dad.  ""Cue the violins"" is a punch line to a joke, not the direction for a scene.  Every plot point is so telegraphed that you just want the movie to hurry up and end.

With the exception of Pete Postlethwaite (RIP), none of the actors feel correct in their roles and most of their performances are over the top (and not in a powerful Al Pacino way).  Yes people, this includes Jon Hamm.

Not to get too technical but the most surprising bad decision in this movie was to go with such a boring film look.  Get ready for some bland color correction and uninspired cinematography.  Where is the swagger?  Where is the attitude in this movie?  Why are most of the scenes filled with sunshine and happiness?  Was I watching Wedding Crashers or a down and dirty thriller?

Conclusion:

It's a good story but poorly executed.  Don't believe the hype, Affleck is not the next Bryan Singer.  He is still Ben Affleck.",1294099200,14,2142,4.561679790026247

4290036,4,B0049EO108,"I'm not the kind that holds movies up against other movies as a comparision, but with THE TOWN and HEAT, you can't help it because their so similar in many ways. Both movies gives looks into the souls of both sides of bank robbery: the tormented souls who grew up and were raised in a history and an element of bank robbery that was common place and second nature, and the officers saddled with tracking them down.

HEAT had one of the best shoot out scenes in the history of film as the robbers and the police have a shootout that spans a city block and the echoes from the bullets bounce off the tall concrete buildings. Al Pacino ducks from car door to car door as the high powered bank robbers outgun the police. THE TOWN tried to duplicate this, all the way up to the sound of the gunfire bouncing off the tall Boston concrete buildings.

There is much to harold about THE TOWN. It is a tremendous film with great performances that is well filmed, well directed and has zero to miniscule fault about it. In fact, I would even go as far as to say that it is one of the best movies of 2010 by far.

Yet, its similarities to HEAT are too numerous. HEAT, which is longer and grittier, managed to make us care about both sides of the crime in the same way. We saw into the lives of all characters involved with an equal telescope and we sympathized with them equally. THE TOWN only gives you a deep look into the life of Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) and his dilemma to lead a life that isn't so hazardous. The other characters, with the exception of Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) are only given brush strokes.

That makes THE TOWN a good movie and a great movie for 2010, but it pales in comparison to HEAT, which managed to make us care deeper and fuller about all the characters involved, even the bad ones.",1294012800,,1805,4.3

Only the whole is not greater than the sum of its parts.",1293926400,2,363,4.27536231884058

And of course the ""hero"" turns out to be the Ben Affleck character, even though he and his fellow dirt bags have killed and wounded many, and terrorized many more.
I spent 25 years in LE (retired), and the only idiots I ever encountered were on the ""other side"" of the law.

4290039,4,B0049EO108,"""The Town"" is about four guys who play bank robbers for real. One of them, Doug, actually had a way out once upon a time but got sucked back into the criminal ways of his hometown, which, I suppose, explains why Ben Affleck playing Doug looks more like a clean-cut star athlete rather than a hoodlum. Doug's the brain to the brawn of the prerequisite sociopath in the gang, James, played to the hilt by Jeremy Renner, who does look the part. But as anti-heroes, these bank robbers are just misunderstood products of their upbringing. It's the town that made them that way, or rather certain elements (evil villains or more products of their circumstance) in the town who pull the strings behind the crimes. The criminals are victims, too, it seems. So in the cat-and-mouse game between the FBI (led by the smart and handsome John Hamm) and the gang of four, one can't help feeling sorry for the poor suckers who see nothing better to do than to rob banks. The movie doesn't over-sentimentalize this point, which is a good thing. Instead, it puts the heart of the movie on a sweet but a bit contrived romance between Doug and Claire (Rebecca Hall), an actual victim of their first bank robbery in the movie. Through this relationship, Doug is shown to be yearning for a life beyond crime and his past, including James' sister (Doug's ex played by Blake Lively who was surprisingly not bad in the role). So in the climax of the movie, when Doug and his gang are forced into one final heist with the FBI on their tails, it is played out as a tense march into certain doom or rebirth? Overall, ""The Town"" deliveries some genuine moments of heart while trying hard to be gritty and violent, but scales no great heights in terms of the script or the acting.",1293840000,,1751,4.526813880126183

The gun battles aren't as dramatic.  How could one compare Pacino, De Niro, Ashley Judd, Amy Brenneman, and a teen-age Natalie Portman to Affleck, Renner, and  Jon Hamm?  It's not fair.  It's not even close.  The acting in Heat made me feel something.  Affleck and Rebecca Hall were the only actors that moved me, albeit slightly.  I hoped for more from Hamm.

Just an all out great film.  Loved it.  I put the digital copy on my iPad to watch on trips, etc. and have both the Blu-ray extended cut with some extra scenes and the DVD.

4290055,4,B0049EO108,"""The Town"" is an absorbing, suspenseful drama that is taken from the novel, ""Prince of Thieves"" by Chuck Hogan.

The story takes place in Boston, Massachusetts and describes the bank robbing activity of four lifelong friends.

The cast includes;
Ben Affleck who stars as Doug MacRay
Jeremy Renner  stars as James ""Jim"" Coughlin
Albert ""Gloansy"" Magloan is Slane
and Owen Burke  stars as Dez Elden

The men have grown up in Charlestown, a suburb of Boston where crime on the streets is a way of life.

The action opens when the men rob a Charlestown bank while wearing masks that fully cover their faces. Someone trips an alarm and the robbers blindfold the bank manager. Claire Ceesey plays this terrified woman, Rebecca Hall.

When the men discover that they have escaped the police search, they set Rebecca Hall free.  Then, upon thinking of possible consequences and the fear of returning to prison if caught, Jem Coughlin thinks that Hall just may have seen something and should be killed.

Doug MacRay may be the leader of the gang and accepts robbing banks but draws the line at cold blooded murder. He declares that he will watch Hall to see if she makes any contact with the FBI.  In doing this, the characters get to know each other and fall in love.

Doug realizes that he has something that he didn't know he needed, someone who loves him and cares what happens to him. He tells the man who organized the bank, Fergie Colum, that he wants to stop robbing banks and move away so he can start a new life. In one of the best scenes in the movie, we witness Fergie's reaction to Doug's request to allow him to leave and stop his criminal activities.

With excellent drama and believable characters, we see what happens when MacRay is the only one who wants to stop robbing and we watch the police and FBI in their attempt to find someone who will turn on the gang and give law officials a chance to catch them.

A final job is planned. This is to rob Fenway Park after a Boston Red Sox game. There is a confrontation between the robbers, the FBI and Boston Police.

I think that movie fans will love this movie as much as I did. It shows good progress in Ben Affleck both as a dramatic actor and as a director.",1293321600,,2217,4.4689826302729525

Highly recommend - this is in my top 20 movies of all time.  As good as ""Heat"" or other Michael Mann flicks in terms of raw suspense - and as good as ""Good Will Hunting"" in terms of writing/directing.",1293148800,,558,4.336538461538462
4290062,4,B0049EO108,"I always like to give credit where credit is due. And while Ben Affleck has been in a string of box office dissapointments after winning an Oscar for Good Will Hunting, he certainly hit his mark with ""The Town"". For being a first time director, screen writer as well as acting in this film, I think Affleck has hit his mark again in film and I only hope that he continues on his winning streak.

 The Town opens with a quote. I'm summarizing of course, but as quoted, ""No town has produced as many bank robbers as Charlestown. Robbing banks and armoured trucks became a trade passed down from father to son, from one generation to the next.""If that didn't grab your interest, the film opens up with a bank robbery. A quick hit (in&out)a Townie crew leaves with the money and this time a hostage.

Doug McCray is the head of this crew,followed by his life long friend Jem who is a little more itchy on the trigger. Jem is paranoid that the the bank manager they took along for ""a ride"" saw more than she thinks"" and he ""wants to take care of business"".Doug steps in to look into it instead to cool Jem's heals and put his crew at rest.

The flip side of this is the crew paying its dues to Fergi, or ""The Flourist"" who has a tight grip on this Charelstown crew. Well aware that the FBI is on them, in time Doug grows weary of doing any more jobs,and at the same time developes a relationship with the bank manager Clair. Possibly against his better judgent, but  I think he sees her as a means to change, and  to put knocking over banks and armoured cars behind him. Clair, as he sees it, is ""his Eskimo.""

Quiting is not as easy as it seems. Not only will Jem let him leave without doing a few more jobs, but The Flourist won't either. Not without Doug paying dearly for it in the end be it his own life, or someone very close to him. Two more jobs down the line, one nearly getting them pinched and the last...robbing Fenway Park, the biggest heist of all.

The Town is a well rounded film. It is a ""heist"" film on one side, but on the flip side of the coin you have layers of character and conflict. It has some great action with adrenaline pumping car chases and shoot outs. It also has a good dramma side to it. The on screen chemistry between Doug and Clair is realistic and heart felt. You realy want him to ""make right"" as well as the others to pull through at the end. Well acted by a great cast and well directed and adapted to the screen by Affleck, it leaves only one to pause, ""I just wanted you to remember who clipped your nuts first.""",1293062400,9,2549,4.219712525667351
4290063,1,B0049EO108,"a bad,  overrated, cheesy piece of junk that's more like a feature-length made-for TV soap opera than a regular movie, which never, ever should've made it into the cinemas at all, in the first place. Yet, The Town is good, in that it has made for much lively discussions on various movie forums, including amazon.com and others.  I also realize that, in order to get the democratic society that we all long for, different viewpoints have to be aired, no matter how much at odds they may be with each other.

The cast is mediocre at best, the plot and story are overused, the Boston accents, especially on the part of Ben Affleck, are forced and way overdone, and the chemistry between Doug and Claire is non-existent to paltry, at best. One of the most, if not the most bothersome aspects of The Town is the message that it clearly conveys; People don't have to be accountable for their actions and behaviors; that it's okay to steal and rob innocent people of money that they don't deserve to lose, to terrorize, permanently maim, put innocent bank employees and customers' lives and safety at risk, to abet an armed felon and wanted fugitive (Doug MacRay, the ringleader)to escape the law by getting involved romantically with him, allow him to buy expensive Tiffany diamond necklaces for one, and make utter dupes of law enforcement people who've been assigned to bring guys like Doug MacRay to justice and end their robbery careers once and for all, by lying to the Feds, and tipping an armed felon and wanted fugitive (Doug MacRay) off to them and helping them escape, and that it's okay to take the law into one's own hands and to kill a couple of people just because they threatened to do Heaven-knows-what to a girlfriend, or whoever. I think it's totally wrong.

Oh, and why is it okay for good-girl Claire to receive stolen goods and spend that ill-gotten money on the renovation of a seedy hockey rink and dedicate it to her criminal boyfriend's mother who she never knew, instead of arranging to turn it into the police anonymously?

Hey...come on! Doug put the romance moves on Claire when he met her, in order to shut her up and warn her oh, so subtely not to talk to the Feds or else! One's supposed to think that Doug really loves Claire and is attrracted to her by her winsome personality, but nothing could be further from the truth, imo. He found Claire attractive, in that she was clearly vulnerable after being traumatized by him and his guys after they held up her bank at gunpoint, and therefore quite gullible and open to exploitation. Almost as soon as Doug got what he wanted out of Claire (a promise not to go to the cops or the Feds), he left the money in her garden and skipped town for Florida, because he was on the lam from the law and couldn't elope with Claire and exploit her as a bargaining chip, the way he'd wanted to do. Yet, there's another reason why Doug left Claire behind when he skipped town for Florida instead of taking her with him; Doug's days of hiding out down in Florida in a house overlooking a bayou were numbered, that sooner or later he'd be hunted down and caught, perhaps violently, by the Feds, and at some level, both he and Claire must've known that. It was especially obvious when FBI Agt. Frawley said to Claire ""You know the FBI is a national organization"", and then requested that the descriptions and photos of Doug MacRay be circulated. Isn't it funny how the vast majority of people, either naively or in willful ignorance, miss all of the above!

It's funny how most people don't realize that Doug was a sociopath who totally exploited the women in his life; Krista for sex, and he left her with nothing, even though he knew she had a young child to take care of (who might or might not be Doug's), and Claire, who he thought he could elope to Florida with, but could not, after having charmed her into trusting him and then worming his way into her heart so that she'd shut up and not talk to the Feds. One is supposed to sympathize with both Doug and Claire, but, in reality, neither of them deserved any sympathy.

Imho, when the Feds had Claire and Doug meet at her Charlestown condo in a last-ditch effort to nab Doug MacRay and send him off to a Federal penitentiary for his crimes, the Feds should've made Claire keep her big fat trap shut, not call Doug or answer any of his phone calls, and let them do their job of arresting Doug and bringing him to prison for his crimes.

Doug deserved to end up in a federal penitentiary for his crimes, and Claire deserved to be criminally prosecuted herself, or at least put on some sort of probation for abetting Doug and for receiving stolen goods (Doug's illl-gotten heist money).

I'm sorry, folks, but I cannot bring myself to be sympathetic to either Doug or Claire, who, imho, turned out to be the most dislikable, and annoying characters in The Town. I also think the fact that Claire quit her job as a bank manager after the robbery without telling anybody, including the Feds, is also rather suspicious. What most people don't realize is that Doug is an armed felon and wanted fugitive who's on the lam from the law, so he's not going to Florida on vacation. Happily, there's no way that he and Claire will ever meet again, which is what the final ""I'll see you again, this side or the other"" sentence in Doug's ""goodbye, I'll always love you"" letter to Claire before he skipped town for Florida means, but the fact that Claire didn't turn to Frawley for help after learning the truth about Doug and reallizing that she was in over her head, is beyond stupid, and wrong.

The fact that Doug and Jem beat the crap out of two Dominicans from a housing project who'd supposedly thrown bottles at Claire when she'd been stupid enough to walk by herself through a housing project (no woman in her right mind would do that, at any time of night or day) and permanently cripple them, especially since they didn't even tell the two Dominicans why they are beating him up, shows that underneath that smooth, sweet-talking, gentle veneer of his, Doug, as well as Jem, is a man of unprovoked violence, and more like his incarcerated father (who, btw, is serving several life sentences in MCI-Cedar Junction for bank robbery and murder) than he would've liked to admit. My, my...Lady Claire must've felt flattered that two armed felons who were also wanted fugitives from the law came to her defense! Pretty sickening, this whole thing.

This is something that still continues to dog me, even though I've written about it so many times.  Why, oh why do so many people fall for such a hyped-up, cheap, overrated, trashy movie such as The Town, and, more to the point, refuse to accept dissenting opinions on it?  It beats me...I don't know!

I admit to one thing, however:  The Town left me rooting for the cops and the FBI, especially Agt. Adam Frawley and wanting them to catch Doug MacRay and his men  and send them to jail for their crimes, and to have Claire either criminally prosecuted herself for being an accessory to Doug's crimes and for tipping him Doug off with a ""sunny days"" code and enabling him to elude the law as well as her receiving stolen goods, or at least put on some sort of probation for her bulls***.  Sure, I sympathized with Claire at first, because she was the victim of an armed bank robbery, which wasn't her fault, but I completely lost my sympathy for her when she not only got involved, wholesale, in  a romance with Doug, but refused to sever all contacts with him even after she learned through Agt. Frawley who Doug MacRay really was, and what he was up to..  Unlike most people, who are sympathetic with Ben Affleck's character in that film, and with Claire, I am not.

Why should I be sympathetic to either Doug or Claire?  The idea that Doug MacRay wanted to change and redeem himself through Claire is utter bulls***, especially after he engaged in an act of vigilantism by taking the law into his own hands, going back to Charlestown, and gunning down Rusty and Fergie just because they threatened Doug's ladygirl Claire with physical harm.  Come on now! Doug MacRay's still a criminal and he was not the decent guy he came across as when he and Claire met ""by chance"" in a C-Town laundromat.

Doug MacRay, like his friends and partners in crime, are not only skilled, disciplined and ruthless in their quest for quick money through parasitic behaviors such as armed robbery, and who'd unquestionably kill or seriously injure people enough to put them in the hospital if they're considered obstacles to what they want, but Doug knows how to come across as a nice guy, when he's really not.  He may not be crazy like his best friend and righthand man, Jem, but he's a sociopath and a person of unprovoked violence just the same.  The fact that he came across as such a nice, charming guy and deceived Claire by pretending to be an upstanding, law-abiding citizen, when he's really not, is more than disgusting...it's part of his criminal behavior.  As for Claire, the fact that she took Doug's bait and rose to it is pathetic indeed.

If Doug had really wanted to change, imo, he would've turned himself and his guys in, come forward, negociated with the Feds for some protection for himself, been sensitive and caring enough to realize that his actions and behaviors were putting Claire in danger and let her go, and then stopped robbing banks once and for all.  Doug left for Florida without Claire for two reasons:

A)  Doug MacRay was an armed felon and wanted fugitive who'd been on the lam from the law for quite awhile, plus he'd just killed Fergie and Rusty.

B) Doug had gotten what he really wanted out of Claire all along;  a promise from her not to turn him in, which he got.
How can so many people be so naive or willfully stupid as to miss that?

Also, if Doug wanted to redeem himself, he would've come forward, served his time, and after a prison term, found honest ways to raise the funding for the renovation for the C-Town hockey rink himself, instead of using Claire Keesey as a go-between.  What people don't realize is that Doug wasn't a nice guy...even to Claire, even though most people firmly believe that he was.  The fact that he deceived her, seduced her and made a total fool out of her was vicious.  The fact that Claire acted like a poor, confused, dumb-assed adolescent and allowed herself to be manipulated, made a fool out of and taken advantage of by Doug is pitiful, but she doesn't deserve pity, due to the fact that she helped the very guy who turned her life upside down and caused her a ton of grief in the first place escape the law.

As for Kristina, well, I don't like her sordid lifestyle or behavior (drug and alcohol addiction, sleeping around with too many men, and the fact that she was in the business herself by helping to book hotel rooms and get costumes for Doug and his men, and being a drug mule for Fergie and Rusty), but i'll say this:  I feel kind of sorry for Krista, in a way, because she had far fewer choices than Claire;  she'd grown up with Doug and Jem, who, like many other men, abused and exploited her for their own ends.  Krista's daughter, Shyne, still an infant, caught in the middle of all this s***, was innocent, and I felt sorry for her, too.

I'm so sick of people saying that what the white collar criminals (not defending them, btw) are worse than guys like Doug MacRay and his gang, because it's unrelated, and not true.  Neither the book Prince of Thieves, on which The Town was based, or the movie, make any effort to get at causes of bank robbery and other crimes, and the circumstances  under which Doug and his men had grown up under.  Moreover, the movie asks the audience to sympathize with Doug MacRay and his men, as well as Claire, who acted stupidly enough to allow Doug to take advantage of her, and who became an accessory to his crimes, while considering law enforcement officials assigned to bring criminals like MacRay and company to their knees and have them locked up in penetentiaries once and for all.  Dez was a smart (he was college-educated and had a regular job) but stupid guy;  he was pretty much just along for the ride, and did what he was told to do by the gang, and yet, at the same time, he seemed to be pretty much their victim, as well, if one gets the drift.  Dez allowed himself to be taken for a ride, also.
At least the book fleshes out the characters and spends more time on Dez and Krista, and doesn't focus on the viewpoint of Doug and Jem so much, plus the book takes a far less sympathetic outlook towards Doug and his men.  Sorry, folks, but I can't bring myself to like this film, except for the very beginning.

The Town also normalizes the Stockholm Syndrome and its inverse, the Lima Syndrome.  One doesn't have to be in any of the helping professions (i. e. psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, etc.) to realize that, while a person who's taken hostage and falls victim to the Stockholm Syndrome (i. e. falling in love with her captor) or the Lima Syndrome (i. e. accepting the overtures of her captor, who falls in love with her), presumably has a better chance of survival in a hostage situation, the victim, in either case, is turned into a person who is at her captor's beck and call, is manipulated and controlled by him, and is essentially brainwashed into believing that her captor cares enough about her not to kill her, and that he'll always treat her kindly and not abuse her.  This couldn't be farther from the truth, especially because, all too often, the victim is isolated from her friends and loved ones, and begins to blame law officials and other authorities, as well as loved ones and friends for her troubles and turn against them rather than her captor who committed this criminal act against her in the first place.

Common sense is required, in order to at least minimize the possibility of having something like that happen to him or her;  Just because one meets a charming guy or gal, especially in a laundromat, doesn't mean that they're necessarily out for any good, particularly if one is in an area that's known to be tough, with a violent history to it.  Anybody who meets someone that they've never seen before, no matter where they are, or how charming they may  be, should be much more careful, and not be so quick to accept dates with someone or get into things with people they don't know that well.

Claire was a woman who used no common sense what. so. ever, and she ended up having a breakdown when it finally backfired on her.  Hey...if I'd known her in real life, I'd tell her..""Hey..don't you understand that if you play with fire, you're going to get burned? Think about that!""

Supposed the bank manager hadn't been as angelic-looking as Claire, or had been someone with a learning/developmental disability such as autism, Aspergers, dyslexia, ADD/ADHD, or a seizure disorder?  Do people honestly believe that Doug and his men would've even acted the least bit charming and sympathetic towards her?  I personally don't think so.  Doug would've allowed Jem and his other men to do whatever he wanted with her, and she probably would've been gang-raped or ""offed"" by Doug and his posse of armed criminals.  Don't kid yourselves, folks!

Doug, contrary to how he came across to Claire, wasn't a nice guy, even to her.  He was playing her, and anybody who thinks that Doug and his men wouldn't have killed her if she'd resisted and refused to comply with them is just kidding themselves.

4290064,1,B0049EO108,"Bought this movie because I was misdirected by the trailers I saw.  Thought it is an all-action thriller, a movie that will keep you on the edge from start to finish.  Let me put it this way:  For every minute of action you get 20 minutes of drama, plain talk and boredom...  On a scale from 1 to 10, I have to try really hard to give it a 3.  But that's my opinion...",1293062400,8,368,3.918918918918919
4290065,4,B0049EO108,"A strong, fun and very well detailed crime thriller, but not nearly as subtle or emotionally and morally complex as Affleck's earlier 'Gone Baby Gone'.

There's a lot of clichs here, especially in the third act; car chases and huge over-the-top shootouts which, while well handled, make this feel much more like a familiar Hollywood movie.  Also, some of the supporting characters fall into 'types' we've seen many times before.  That was  something Affleck avoided in  'Gone Baby Gone' -- despite that film being a hard boiled detective thriller, hardly an under-done genre.

Indeed, a lot of this film, including the central plot itself treads familiar water, but it does it with enough grown up intelligence, good acting, and specificity to let us get caught up anyway. And at least, by the end, a few of the 'obvious' set ups, have actually led us somewhere quite different than the standard Hollywood treatments we've seen before would lead us to expect.

I just hope Affleck, an obviously extremely talented film-maker, returns to the kind of thematically richer and more original material he mined in his first film.  This shows talent and flair, but I longed for those deeper layers.",1293062400,4,1191,4.97979797979798

I enjoy a story that's able to draw me in to the point where I'm helpless to do anything but root for the bad guy - even though I don't condone their actions - because I've been compelled to see things from their perspective and sympathize with the circumstances that brought them to that point.

I was impressed with the balance of elements that make a film appealing to a broad audience (drama, action, romance, suspense), and look forward to seeing Ben Affleck's future work as a director.",1292976000,3,669,4.528925619834711

4290068,4,B0049EO108,"There's something to be said about The Town, most of which lies with director/co-writer/star Ben Affleck, and what's to be said is that he has risen above his mistakes in the past in terms of career choices.  Anyway, Affleck stars as Doug, a career criminal who after pulling his latest heist with his lifelong and loyal pal Jem (Jeremy Renner) strikes up a romance with the bank manager (Rebecca Hall) he just robbed, while seeking to learn whether or not the FBI and the determined lead agent (Jon Hamm) know anything about him and his crew.  While the theatrical cut runs a bit too long (and the extended cut of the film is practically self-indulgence), The Town is a gripping and surprisingly adrenaline charged film that boasts some of the best work to come from Affleck in years acting-wise, and it shows that as a director he has a keen eye for ultra-compelling action scenes.  It doesn't pack that same kind of punch that Affleck's directorial debut Gone Baby Gone did, but it leaves a lasting impression regardless, even if its slightly upbeat ending (much different than the ending to ""Prince of Thieves"", from which the film is adapted) kind of betrays everything that lead up to it.  Still, The Town is a worthwhile endeavor regardless, and wholeheartedly worth your time.",1292976000,,1284,4.796380090497737

4290071,5,B0049EO108,"I have to admit I was one of those people who didn't expect much from Ben Affleck.  I was wrong.  In ""The Town,"" Affleck reaffirms the values of classic Hollywood genre pictures even as he demonstrates his mastery of the craft.  It's great to experience the arrival of a director capable of continuing the tradition of Walsh, Aldrich, Eastwood, et al!  And ""The Town"" is a great movie experience.

I saw it tonight at a screening at Warner Bros, where the security people had misdirected half the invited audience to the wrong screening room.  So, after watching the fantastic first 15 minutes, the lights came back up and we were asked if we minded if they started the movie over for latecomers.  Nobody objected.

Afterwards,  I took a walk in the rain down the old backlot streets where Edward G. Robinson,  Humphrey Bogart, and George Raft used to shoot 'em up.  All I could think was that somewhere above the rain clouds the old Warner Bros tough guys were smiling!

Bear in mind, I never thought I'd be such a fan of Ben Affleck.  For me, ""Good Will Hunting"" is to independent film what Sarah Palin is to the brain.  But if the success of GWH gives us a director of Affleck's stature (and an actor as good as Matt Damon has become), then all is forgiven!",1292976000,,1260,4.493392070484582
4290072,5,B0049EO108,"Charlestown's claim to fame is producing the most bankrobbers per capita in the United States. That means, amongst other things, that Charlestown has a bad reputation and some pretty interesting lives. Amongst those are the people we pick up with who, along with a few faces that enter in some rather strange ways, as they find themselves doing the job. There are four of them; you have the leader, the wheelman, the guy with the temper, and the other guy. Along with the fact that they are really good is also the fact that they know it. This leads one to cockiness, one to want out, division in the others, and people who don't want them to walk away.

The story is a rather good one with a few flaws that happen to get mixed in along the way. The worst of the flaws comes in the ending, too, when you really have to throw all doubt out the widow to see the scenario they build actually playing out (I am avoiding spoilers, too, so pardon the vague references). Suspension of disbelief is one of those things you have to carry with you into movies, however, and this is more than just a few scenes splashed together by adrenaline junies. You see other sides to the characters, and some of these are really tangled up. Amongst those are relationships that should not be carried out, a bond between thieves, and the question of what you own your home and how much it ultimately owns you.

I have been a J.R. fan but not a Ben fan so it surprised me just how well they fit in. Then again, the role that B.A. got was one that had great support, and he really was the calm one of the bunch. I liked the acting side of the movie, the pace, the story that was going on, and even the look into the culture aroudn these nefarious people. In fact, I'd say the town really got a nice piece of acting out of these various portions of the persona. along with it was also the action which, seeing the pace and seeing the masks they robbed with and realy finding them creepy, playe dout perfectly.
There were flaws and some easy to spot plot transitions but these things happen. Besides, the movie had a great pace and didn't solely rely on these pieces.

If you like action it has it. If you like a mix it has it as well. It isn't mindless but it isn't convoluted and, really, I'm glad that it is not. Too many things are and, well, that hurts. If this seems good then try it on because it kept my interest despite me not thinking it would.

4290075,4,B0049EO108,"The Town is blessed with great acting and a suspenseful, engrossing plot.  The title refers to the Charlestown neighborhood in Boston.  In the first minutes of the film we learn that this neighborhood has produced more bank robbers than any other  place in the US.  This film is about one of these robbers, Doug Macray, who is a mastermind of clever bank heists, and who, after falling in love with a former hostage, wants out.  The movie's strength is in the character development of Doug, movingly brought to life by Ben Affleck, and in the suspense surrounding the bank heists.  Its weakness is that the plot sometimes borders on becoming unbelievable, especially in the chase scenes, which is why I give it 4.5 stars rather than five. That being said, Ben Affleck's characterization of Doug Macray is completely believable. He has managed to create a sympathetic criminal whom we root for in spite of ourselves.",1292803200,,915,4.870967741935484
4290076,4,B0049EO108,"I liked most all of The Town; well-acted for the most part, nice tight script, and Affleck showing more acting chops than usual (ok, not exactly a Herculean task). He also helms this one pretty well; it's clear he's seen plenty of cop and heist flicks, and works with their tropes pretty well. If you love gun porn, there's no shortage here.

But gee whiz, must we be treated/subjected to sooo many ennndless shots of Concerned Ben and Confused Ben and all the other deeply taciturn Bens walking down the street, staring into space from a chair, or otherwise being as quasi-Brandoesque as he can manage? Affleck clearly thinks Affleck is one of the hottest guys around, so we're treated to looong shots of Affleck, over and over. Cut those and this 125 minute movie is suddenly maybe 105, with a lot more edge and impact. As much as I enjoyed many scenes here, it all dragged a fair bit at parts and that really lessened the power for me.

Nonetheless, it's a solid heist/good cop/standard doomed romance flick, with a good blu-ray transfer, and well worth seeing for fans of those genres. There's definitely a large Heat influence, which is not so bad as that's one of the best of this genre. And if you love looking at Ben Affleck as much as Ben Affleck does, then you will absolutely adore this movie. And Ben. He's not only cute, but he's so deeeeep.

  I fell in love with this movie. From Ben Afflack's tough guy character, to Rebecca Hall's innocent character Claire. Most people have their opinions on the movie but the blu ray is what is really special. The Blu ray includes a 30 minute longer extended edition. Any one who has read Chuck Hogan's ""Prince of Thieves"" (The book that the movie is loosely based on) will enjoy the extended scenes that mirror parts in the book better than the theatrical release. I enjoy watching the extended edition because it really feels like a different movie, unlike Avatar, which only added 8 minutes of CGI porn into the theaters.

 To be honest I think that the regular theatrical edition flows better than the extended one. The audio is top notch, the second heist scene and car chase that follows really sounds amazing. And the picture is clear enough that you can see Ben's 5-o'clock shadow perfectly. Over all a good movie, great disc that offers a longer, ( longer ) edition.

So what are the chances that you could find three brave friends that also think robbing banks is a good way to make a living? According to Ben Affleck, if you live in Charlestown, MA, your chances would be better than anywhere else in the US.

So goes the story of The Town. Ben, Jeremy Renner and a couple of other guys hit Boston area banks with spooky looking masks and make off with the loot. Things get complicated when Ben gets too up close and personal with one of the bank managers. So he decides to move up to the ""major leagues"" with one more giant heist before calling it quits.

I think this story has been written many different ways always with a different title: Guy gets wrapped up in crime, sees the light, and wants to get out of crime. But The Town is so well done that as you watch you forget about the familiarity. The Town is well acted and full of action. At times some of the car chasing and shootouts are a little farfetched, but they are certainly thoroughly entertaining...and so is the rest of the movie.

I think they only showed ""the crew"" all together once or twice and I could not tell you a single detail about the other Two members of the crew aside from Affleck and Renner.

4290086,4,B0049EO108,"THE TOWN, the title refers to Charlestown, a section of Boston infamous for the crime and criminals who hail from that area, and Director, Actor, and Co-Writer (with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard) Ben Affleck knows this area well as is evident in not only the  accents of all of his characters but also in the choices of locations for this fast moving bank heist drama.  Affleck knows how to bring out the best in his cast of superb actors - never forgetting that despite the crusty surfaces of his people their lies beneath a bruised psyche.

Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) leads a gang of bank robbers - James Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Gloansy Magloan (Slaine), Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) - carrying off a series of successful heists dressed in costumes to conceal their identity, laundering their stolen money at the guidance of florist Fergie (Pete Postlethwaite) in a manner that eludes the police.  During one of their heists they take a hostage, the bank manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) whom they release after the heist. Knowing that she may inform the FBI Doug decides to makes friends with her  but instead of assuring his fellow gang that she will not be a problem Doug instead falls for her.  The FBI - Frawley (Jon Hamm) and Dino (Titus Welliver) - remain hot on the gang's trail, attempting to get information from Doug's old girlfriend Krista (Blake Lively, in a breakout performance!).  Doug is conflicted and thinks of leaving the gang so that he won't end up like his father (Chris Cooper) who is in jail, but James is the baddy here and demands the gang stay together for at least one last major heist. A schism arises between Doug and Claire and uncovers a deep scar from Doug's past. From that point on through the end of the film the story is filled with conflicts, chases, the gang's outwitting the FBI and Boston police, all with the gang's penchant for changing disguises frequently.  The  ending is full of surprises.

Though not a great movie, THE TOWN is far better a film than many that are gaining award nominations.  One of the reasons is the tight ensemble work by this surprisingly fine cast who together give us a slice of Boston we'll not forget. Well worth watching.

4290087,5,B0049EO108,"THE TOWN follows Doug MacRay, a bank robber, who falls in love with the victim of one of his heists.  It is the story of a man's struggle with his own identity, against the backdrop of the criminal community in which he was raised.

That's a neat summary; really, no more is needed.  THE TOWN is a marvel.  I've never been a fan of Ben Affleck's acting; he's held his own on occasion (DOGMA), but he's let me down quite often.  Here, he shines.  It also helps that he's directing.  TOWN captures the vibe of GONE BABY GONE, without retreading any previous territory.  It is a gripping tale that also features stellar performances from John Hamm, Rebecca Hall, Chris Cooper (grossly underused, as he tends to be), Pete Postlethwaite, Blake Lively, and especially Jeremy Renner as MacRay's psychotic friend.  Almost all of the film's acting is solid; it's rooted deep in the Boston community (again, think GONE BABY GONE, or a watered-down DEPARTED), and the characters jump to life.

It's hard, grasping just what makes this movie stand out.  Yet, it does.  It isn't just another crime thriller.  It isn't on the level of THE DEPARTED or HEAT, or arguably even GONE BABY GONE (which at least benefited from Dennis Lehane's stellar novel); yet, THE TOWN is destined to stand as a classic Boston crime film.  Largely, this is due to Affleck's directing; never entirely comfortable before the camera, he has found his true calling as a director, able to bring about the absolute best from his cast (including himself).  For a film whose ending is predictably violent (yes, you'll see it coming), THE TOWN emerges surprisingly original and fresh.  It's a crime film worth repeated viewing; its characterization, and its immersion in its setting, help it stand out from the pact of films passing themselves off as ""heist capers"" these days.",1292457600,,1834,4.830128205128205

I really didn't like him when he was basically banking his money off the fact that his name was tied to ""Good Will Hunting,"" and just mailed in a few performances. But I must say that now he's come back down to Earth and has settled down with his life it just seems like to me that everything that he's tying his name to has more merit to it than let's say ""Reindeer Games, and Gigli."" What really made me start noticing the change in Affleck was when I went and saw Hollywood Land in theaters a few years ago, and his portrayal of George Reeves was just terrific. But now back to this movie, The Town is an absolute treat for sore eyes. I've seen way too many true crime thrillers over my lifetime and I must say that this one is a must have. I wouldn't be surprised if this film one day is considered an absolute cult classic. The reason why I say this is because one of my personal favorite movies in this genre is Reservoir Dogs, and Goodfellas. To me this film is up there with ether one of them, what it lacks in plot line, makes up with in overall character design and execution. In fact this movie reminds me of a modern day Reservoir Dogs.

4290092,3,B0049EO108,"This is an interesting film, if only due to the strange high-praise it's getting. Gone Baby Gone is a vastly superior film, but it actually got ""worse"" reviews than The Town (though both films were very highly praised).

The film's problems can be overlooked, though there are some glaring weaknesses. Not the least of which is Ben Affleck in the lead of a bank robber with a conscience. The best part of Gone Baby Gone was that Ben Affleck did NOT cast himself in the lead, but he just couldn't resist here. He's just not charismatic and likable. Born to be the villain, but never wanting that role. He should have played the detective, although in reality that would have been the ""good guy"" if this wasn't hollywood trying to make you think that somehow a bank robber is the hero and the man trying to arrest him is the villain.

Jeremy Renner's character is undeveloped. We're not oblivious to films like this, and you get the idea right from the start that there's going to be some sort of betrayal. We've seen it a million times. Unfortunately, since you're looking for that, it's easy to overlook the family-like connection between the two. So there's an issue there. Renner's sister is introduced as a slut and very little is used to get into her and Affleck's backstory until the very end. The film's biggest weakness is definitely how characters are introduced without much explanation, and as such, it's difficult to know where they fit into the big scheme of things. As I said, films like this always seem to go in a certain direction and, when a film doesn't, you need to avoid misdirection - because everyone sitting in that theater was fully aware that Renner and Affleck would be at odds at one point (I'm not saying it does happen, but the seeds are planted from the start that it will happen).

Another issue is the idea of a bank robber falling in love with a hostage. Seen that before, very recently in fact. In fact, a lot of this movie just feels like bits and pieces of other movies. There's not really an original idea to be had anywhere here. It was shot almost exactly like Gone Baby Gone, but it lacks in every category that GBG excelled in.

The final annoyance is tying Fenway Park into the ending. I know that Affleck is Red Sox fan, but the whole parking garage shootout thing wasn't very good. You could tell they said ""Hey, let's put Fenway in the movie"" and then had to write a scene around it. That's not how you make a good movie. It gets better after that, but that scene reminds me of the lame beach battle at the end of Robin Hood (2010). It's just like ""really? that's the best you could do for the CLIMACTIC battle!?""

I'm ripping the film, but it's pretty good. I know others are going to give it high praise, so my review is just to balance them out - to let you know in advance that this isn't a great crime drama like Gone Baby Gone was. There are no amazing performances by people you've never heard of. There's no brilliantly woven story with twists. It's just a movie that tries to be Heat - and on some levels succeeds, but for the most part, it just doesn't need to exist. Easily forgotten and discarded, Affleck needs to figure out why he made Gone Baby Gone and consider those reasons in his future endeavors, because The Town is lacking the soul that GBG had.",1291939200,10,3312,4.449752883031302
4290093,5,B0049EO108,"I have always thought that Ben Affleck's acting skills are mediocre at best.  When watching most of his films, my thought would often turn to how the film in question could have been elevated with someone else in the role.  That was certainly the case when I saw ""State of Play"", in which Russell Crowe acted circles around him, or so I thought.

But then I watched ""Gone Baby Gone"", and started to think that maybe Mr. Affleck's real talent lies behind the camera, not in front of it.  ""Gone Baby Gone"" was a taut, suspenseful thriller that kept me guessing until the end.  And with ""The Town"", Mr. Affleck has proven that he knows his way behind a camera and that his directorial debut was no fluke.

""The Town"" takes place in the seedy underbelly of Boston, where the central character Doug McRay has lived his whole life and where he spends his spare time planning and executing bank robberies.  At the beginning of the film, Doug and gang succeeds in robbing a bank (in rubber masks) but ends up taking the bank manager (Clare) hostage as insurance against the police.  Even though they released her a short time later, it was soon found out that she actually lived only a few blocks from where Doug and gang lived and hung out.  Thinking that he may have seen her around the neighborhood and that she may have recognized him, Doug staged a ""chance meeting"" with her in order to find out what she knows and ends up developing a romantic relationship with her.  To complicate matters further, his best friend Jem is growing increasingly unstable and have become a loose cannon, shooting people and engaging in other sorts of violence acts without the situation calling for it.  With the FBI closing in on them, the woman he likes just one step away from discovering the truth about him, and a friend whose unpredictible behavior may put a lot of people in jeopardy, what is a man to do?

From the surface, ""The Town"" is an old-fashioned cop drama that we have all see a million times before.  What elevates it from the masses, however, is the solid acting, the character-focused plot, and the clean, well-shot action sequences.  This may very well be the best performance I've seen Ben Affleck given, and his supporting cast is equally solid.  The film boasts of several exciting action sequences, and these were all staged in a way that brought a refreshingness and new perspective to what can otherwise be stale material.  Mr. Affleck also understood the importance of creating 3 dimensional characters that the audience can care about; and it is because you care about what happens to these people that you will be kept on the edge of your seat as the plot unfolds on the screen.  Plotwise, the story may be cliched, but the way in which this film was put together certainly was not.

With ""Gone Baby Gone"", Mr. Affleck has proven that he knows his way behind a camera.  With ""The Town"", it is obvious that he has further improved on his craft.  He is no Martin Scorsee, but when it comes to making films with exciting action and likable characters, he is not too shabby...not too shabby at all.",1291852800,5,3102,4.595281306715064
4290094,2,B0049EO108,"Even the music score(action scenes) is similar to Mann's masterpiece...but ""Heat"" remains matchless,well the masks look pretty weird for a change...and the director has completely ignored the idea to put up some fake wigs/beards or even to color the hair of the remaining suspect..& of cos shooting the guy on the head doesn't fit Ben's character + a whole lot more funny things..!",1291680000,3,381,5.063492063492063

While the Town is a good movie and I enjoyed it, I couldn't help feeling that I was watching Heat 2.  Everything was predictable, I wasn't watching anything that hadn't been done before.

4290096,4,B0049EO108,"There have been lots of good heist, bank robber movies and few have matched the intensity and brilliance of the movie Heat(Al Pacino, Robert De Niro). I was really surprised that The Town pretty much hits the nail on the head in all aspects of that film along with some others. Matter a fact, taking ""heat"" is mentioned several times during the film and there are many familiarities in other ways as well. Ben Affleck does a great job as director and actor here. His performance is good but not stellar, as he has a little trouble with the whole Boston accent, which his brother also had in Gone Baby Gone, but thats a small issue. The movie is fairly plausible and there are only a few action scenes in the whole film. I don't think its worth all the hype it got, but i think its more because of its originality than the actual performances here.

On another note, there really haven't been a lot of good bank heist movies for a long time. The reason i call the movie Heat 2 is because they were masks, use the same strong language, burn the vehicles they took off in, same weapons, and even during the end gun fight scenes they sound and have the same weapons. So yes if your a big fan of Heat as i was then you will love The Town. There is also a similar love interest and i'm not really who you think i am theme that goes along with it. So i won't give away every detail but just a little heads up on what your ready to see.

It's good, its very familiar but not so much so that you really know what to expect form moment to moment. The movie isn't perfect but it does the job and Ben Affeck is becoming a better director than most of the pros out there. So with another few films under his belt he should be on his way to a good career in film making. He's only 38 so he's got lots of time to make things a go, so maybe he'll be the next Clint Eastwood. Who knows.",1291248000,,1869,4.103825136612022
4290097,5,B0049EO108,"It seems that most of us grow up with some version of the family business. Hollywood in itself is a prime example. The Barrymore name has been ever present as long as making movies has been a business. As a child is raised into the family business there comes the time to make the ultimate decision. Do you rebel and become something else? Or do you find comfort in the continuation of way of life? But what is a person to do if there is no way to rebel from the family business without dire consequences.

This is the theme explored in Ben Affleck's new film The Town. Ben directed, co-wrote the screenplay adaption and stars in this film about the most dangerous family business: crime. Ben's character, Doug MacRay, is a crook. His one chance to make a difference in his life by being drafted to play professional hockey was stopped short by his own cocky behavior. Left to live in a crime-ridden area of Boston, nothing was left to do, but go into the family business.

Doug belongs to a crew that orchestrates high stakes robberies in return for great riches. But this crew belongs to the old man that Doug's father worked for and with his father in prison for the remainder of his life, Doug knows that it is only time before he will be joining dad in the pen. It's obvious that Doug is the brain of the crew and his best friend James, played perfectly by Jeremy Renner, is the hot-tempered wild card. After Claire, the witness of one heist gets too close, Doug starts following her to make sure that she doesn't know too much. He moves in to acquaint himself with her and a very touching romance develops between the two. Claire is unaware that this man that appears to be a gentle young man is the same masked man that robbed her bank and scared her to the core.

It's obvious that once Doug and Claire become close that Doug is planning to leave. Only one problem: you don't just quit this family business. With his life in danger from his own boss and the FBI closing in, and his unpredictable friend, Doug finds it hard to manipulate the situation to his advantage. Just when his plan is underway, Claire finds out his true identity and a girl from the neighborhood, a drug addict named Krista becomes too talkative, just all may be lost.

But Doug's dream of a new life and a fresh start with the woman he loves propels him to complete his most dangerous job, and find a way to escape the hold his home town has on him. The rest of the film plays out unpredictable in a smart and intriguing way. Perhaps, for a few of those who have gone down the wrong path, a new and more pure path awaits.

Ben Affleck shines on many levels with this film. His acting along with his cast mates is well executed and all the characters are believable. The script, adapted from the book ""The Prince of Thieves,"" by Chuck Hogan is craftily adapted by Affleck, Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard.  The story is well paced and Affleck's direction adds another depth of realism to the film. This is not Affleck's first turn as Director, his film Gone Baby Gone was one of 2007's best film.

This is a great film and should not be missed. I predict that Ben Affleck is on the path of being one of Hollywood's best directors and will have a long presence in Hollywood. His directing method is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's work. For those of you who have not seen Gone Baby Gone, give the DVD a try, you will not be disappointed.

The Buzz: When award season comes around, I don't think The Town will garner any attention. If it does, I see a nomination for best adapted screenplay and /or a nomination to Jeremy Renner for best supporting actor.

4290103,4,B0049EO108,"With GONE, BABY, GONE, Ben Affleck announced himself as a very capable director.  It was a riveting film (even if it had some rather melodramatic turns...more the fault of author Dennis Lehane), and showed an excellent feel for working with actors.  With THE TOWN, Affleck has stepped up his game another notch.

Very little that's truly new happens in THE TOWN.  It tells the story of a small band of bank robbers, the cop who seeks them, and how the leader of the gang wants to get out and go straight, mostly out of love for a woman who is transforming him.  This is a genre film...pulp even.  These kinds of movies have been with us almost since movies began...and yet well-made crime films still grab us (HEAT springs to mind, but there are plenty of others) and poorly made ones are quickly forgotten.  THE TOWN is certainly in the earlier category.  It may not emerge as an all-time classic, but it is a sturdy, solid film with a true feel for its Boston locations and some outstanding performances.

Ben Affleck is Doug, the leader of the gang.  His team wears comical masks and makes fast, non-violent robberies.  But one day, things go a little awry, and the gang grabs a hostage, Claire (Rebecca Hall).  Although she is released safely, there is fear that she may be able to ID her captors.  Doug's childhood friend, and resident psycho,  James (Jeremy Renner) wants her dead.  Doug, taking a more reasonable approach, wants to meet her and talk to her, to see if she recognizes him.  Not only does she not recognize him, but the two fall into a romance.  This doesn't set well with James, who has always imagined that Doug would marry his sister Krista (Blake Lively).  The two have a strained relationship, which is tested more and more as the film progresses.  Hot on their heels is FBI agent Frawley (Jon Hamm); yet at the same time, neighborhood crime boss Fergus (Pete Postlethwaite) insists that the gang keep working, since he always gets a cut of their jobs.  Doug is torn, but agrees to ""one last heist.""

Affleck is from Boston, and his two films show that he knows the neighborhoods very well.  We don't get the glossy, touristy vision of these cities.  We see the tough neighborhoods, the lower-middle class streets and the business districts that are off the main roads. (Although we also get some interesting backstage looks at the baseball stadium.)  THE TOWN has a very strong sense of being in a very specific place.  This gives the entire film a sheen of reality.  It's a genre film with many familiar elements, but the specificity of the surroundings help make it seem more original than perhaps it is.

Affleck also gets solid performances from everyone.  Best of all is Jeremy Renner (THE HURT LOCKER)...he's charming and dangerous in equal measure.  We've sure seen this character in many films before...friend who drags down those closest to him...but Renner makes James a very specific character, and truly makes his role rise above clich level.  Rebecca Hall does nice work, and Jon Hamm is stolid and straight-laced.  Blake Lively plays very effectively against type...she is far from a Gossip Girl.  And special notice goes to the always amazing Postlethwaite (his villain is a truly slimy guy...no one can ooze danger better than this guy) and to Chris Cooper, who plays Affleck's father in one scene that is so well-written and performed, we pretty much learn all we'd ever need to about the relationship between father and son.

Affleck keeps the pace moving along at a decent clip.  He doesn't try anything fancy...his films almost feel like throwbacks to the gritty urban crime movies of the `70s...you can almost imagine Pacino or DeNiro of that era fitting right in here.  And Affleck clearly knows how to work with actors...he's been able to assemble stellar casts in both of his films and to get very nice performances all round.  He handles tone very well...when funny things happen, they are always organic and never take us out of the mood of the film.

Affleck the actor is not quite so hot.  He's better than usual here...but honestly, I wish he would just stay behind the camera.  Ben Affleck seems like a terrific, genuine smart guy with a great wife and an appreciation of how good he has it.  But when he acts, he seems like a charming lug.  He doesn't ruin his own film (not by a long shot), but another, more skillful performer might have elevated THE TOWN another notch.

That being said, this is still an excellent film and is highly recommended for adult audiences looking for some drama and action that actually feels like it might be happening in our world.  I eagerly look forward to Affleck's next effort.",1289174400,2,4671,4.714814814814815
4290104,4,B0049EO108,"** Minor spoilers ahead **

A daring bank heist: four armed robbers in heavy disguises hit a bank in urban Boston, executing every detail with clockwork precision - but despite their precautions, one of the employees manages to trigger a silent alarm, and the cops interrupt them.  Taking one of the managers (Rebecca Hall) as hostage, they flee the scene and manage a getaway without being apparently identified, but paranoid about what the bank manager may have figured out they decide to watch over her.  The leader of the group, Doug (Ben Affleck) takes on the task, and eventually meets her, gets to know her, and...well, you might be able to guess where it's going, as this helps to cause complications with the rest of the group, especially his childhood friend (Jeremy Renner) and as Doug starts to question how much longer he wants to maintain his life of crime.

Ben Affleck's second film as director is a solid genre piece, with good-to-excellent performances for the most part, but there's no question that it's in some ways too beholden to typical crime genre tropes, and rather predictable.  We have Doug, the kid from the old neighborhood (Charlestown, an old neighborhood of Boston that used to be an independent city) who unthinkingly follows a life of crime (bank and armored car robberies) until he realizes there might be a reason to stop; we've got his best buddy (Renner) who keeps guilting him into staying at it, and who is more than a borderline psycho; and the incredibly cold-blooded mob leader who runs the whole operation and won't let anybody leave it (Pete Postlethwaite); the tough FBI agent who has to be almost as dirty as the criminals (Jon Hamm); the victim-girlfriend who doesn't know about the life of crime (Rebecca Hall) and who represents a better life - being educated and not from the projects and all; the scorned, sleazy ex-girlfriend (Blake Lively), and a plot that mostly goes from a to b to c.

But Affleck has a decent visual sense, a really good eye for the neighborhood details, and a solid way of putting together an action sequence - the robberies and car chases are exciting and punchy without relying too much on the typical shaky-cam that to my mind has ruined a lot of action cinema over the past decade.  And he's got an excellent touch with his actors, particularly the women - I would be astonished and disappointed if the British Hall, disappearing completely into an American character, doesn't get some awards attention, despite some thinness in the writing of her character.  I'm not sure that I'm crazy about Affleck's own performance, but his character more than most is hurt by the generic qualities of the script, and the relationship with Hall never comes off as terribly believable from either character's POV.  And there's an attempt I think that grows over the course of the running time at making this story out to be something more than an action-thriller (especially in the rather pretentious snippet of closing narration) that doesn't entirely work - the film can't decide ultimately between being a drama and an action film and isn't capable of handling both smoothly at the same time.  I think we'd have to be more sympathetic to Affleck's character to really get the whole ""tragedy of a life in the projects"" sense that is building; but I for one can't really see a guy who is still willing to fire automatic weapons at cops, with bystanders in close proximity, even after he's claimed that he's going to change his life, as anything like a hero.

Still, despite some fairly significant problems in the screenplay and characterizations, this adds up to a very entertaining piece of work, and Affleck's sense of Boston and the urban terrain is exciting and very solidly real.  I hope he continues to make pictures in the city where he grew up; New York and L.A. get enough visibility in films.  Those who haven't seen a zillion other films of this type and who respond a little bit better to the central romantic/dramatic arc of the story will probably love this film, and I'll certainly be catching up with GONE BABY GONE, Affleck's first film as director, and with Rebecca Hall's earlier performances.",1289174400,3,4181,4.806406685236769

However, what stands out most is the film's production and direction, with which Affleck should also be given accolades.

When I reviewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception/dp/B002ZG980U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception</a>, I called it the best film of the year, citing this film and David Fincher's ""The Social Network"" as the only possible films that could trump Christopher Nolan's sci-fi stunner. While I wasn't as blown away with ""The Town"" as I was with ""Inception"" to make it the best of the year, it still comes in at a very close second. Nevertheless, throughout this crime heist thriller, I couldn't help but be reminded of a 1995 film that paved the way for films like this, Michael Mann's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat-Blu-ray/dp/B0017HRJ04/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat [Blu-ray</a>]. While ""The Town""'s plot is nowhere as intricately expanded as ""Heat,"" the main character of Doug MacRay (Affleck) reminds me a lot of Heat's main character, Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). Both are master thieves who long for a better life, and see that possibility in the form of a woman. Like Amy Brenneman's character in Heat, Rebecca Hall provides the motivation for Affleck's protagonist to want a new life - one that's free from crime. It's the classic hero's journey -- as popularized by mythology maestro Joseph Campbell -- with a protagonist who's not so innocent, looking to better his life. At first, Affleck's MacRay simply sees their hostage (Hall) from their latest heist as a means to an end; he's to check on her and make sure she doesn't talk to the Feds. However, it is through their relationship that he genuinely starts to fall in love with her (of course!).

Like I previously stated, the acting is all good. But the one who really hits it out of the park is Rebecca Hall. Where did this actress come from? She's been in a few hits but this is definitely her breakout role! On the other hand, while Blake Lively does better than anything she's done on her guilty-pleasure television hit ""Gossip Girl,"" her performance here doesn't rank with any of her other co-stars here (let's hope she does better in ""Green Lantern""). The other great thing about the film is the setting itself. Boston and its surrounding areas are itself a character in this film and it adds great depth. Unfortunately, it's not the best of the year, but it's awfully close. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film - and even the ending, I guess - but it didn't fill me with that same viewing pleasure as Inception did. From a technical, overall aspect, there was something slightly amiss just with the ending. I won't give anything away, but I will say it doesn't exactly follow through with the realistic closure.

In a year that has failed to impress me with many standout films, ""The Town"" is one of the best this year, but, then again, it doesn't have much competition. That doesn't sully all of the great reviews for the film nor the film itself. Affleck seems to have found his niche in directing. It's affected his acting for the better and I think we have more to see from this impressive director. ""The Town"" is good entertainment and one of the best films of the year (not the best, though), and I won't be surprised to see it pick up a bunch of nominations come awards season.",1288828800,,5255,6.536585365853658

4290107,4,B0049EO108,"I just saw Ben Affleck's new movie The Town (2010). Absolutely GREAT movie (4 stars out of 5)! It's Affleck's best acting since Good Will Hunting (1997), after years of fair and piss poor acting gigs. The Town is a ""classic"" Hollywood crime/heist/caper movie that follows in the footsteps of Heat (1995), Point Break (1991), Goodfellas (1990), and The Departed (2006). It doesn't have any snazzy new special effects like all the latest Hollywood blockbusters, but this is just good solid movie storytelling. It's clear to me that when Ben writes his roles, he plays his roles the best. And to add direction into the mix, he hit the perfect trifecta with The Town as writer/director/actor. Affleck's directorial debut Gone Baby Gone (2007), with his brother Casey Affleck in the lead role, is also worth checking out. Both Affleck's were in fine form on that flick. It's not quite at the same level as The Town, but it's a darn good movie (3.5 stars out of 5).

I can't say the photography in The Town stood out from the pack, but the movie looked good, gritty and realistic (as the stills below show). The production design made you feel like you were right there in Baaahh-stun (Boston). What strikes me most about The Town is simply good old school movie making on the whole. And that's what I like about this movie. Jeremy Renner is fantastic in his role as Ben Affleck's best friend. He's absolutely believable AND over the top, but you love him for it. Renner's acting in this film is a notch above The Hurt Locker, where I also thought he shined. But in The Hurt Locker, Renner is understated and subtle in his acting compared to The Town. We've now seen an interesting range of skill from Renner and I have a feeling his newly juiced-up career will pay off for years to come, along with Ben Affleck. Jon Hamm plays the good guy in the film, an FBI agent chasing Affleck, Renner and the rest of the crew. It's not Hamm's best work like we've seen in the AMC TV series Mad Men, but it's not bad either. It's just not as well developed of a character since this movie is really centered around the bad guys. But Hamm is good and solid.

While elements of The Town definitely ring familiar from past movies like Heat, Point Break and even Good Will Hunting, those retreads didn't bother me in this film. I think the story and the well-developed characters kept my attention, along with the incredible action scenes and sound. Sure we've seen masked bank robbers before, like the ex-presidents in Point Break, and the magic number of 4 bank robbers in a crew in both Heat and Point Break. Maybe it's just been enough time since those classic 90s movies that it feels nicely retro. And for some reason, I never tire of shoot-em-up scenes in a downtown setting with incredible rapid fire gunplay sounds blasting through the speakers. All in all, The Town is one of the best films of 2010 so far, next to Inception, which is at the top of my list. I hope to see some Oscar love thrown at The Town, but it may get overlooked if the competition heats up with the rest of the movies released in the next 3 months. We'll see!",1286236800,,3120,4.510600706713781
4290108,5,B0049EO108,"First off, let me go ahead and say, The Town is one of the best movies of the year. If that's all you wanted to know, have a nice day. Otherwise, continue on my friend.

I have said it hundreds of times, rather than spell out the plot I prefer to tell you about my experience and feelings about the film. Let's face it - it's a bore to cipher through reviews only to re-read the same material over and over.

The Town is Ben (Gigi) Affleck's second attempt at helming a film, and boy does he succeed. As everyone knows (including Affleck himself, I'm sure) Ol' Ben has been taking heat for his recent choices at the flicker show. Some say it started moments after the final reel of Good Will Hunting had spun. Some say he was doomed once Armageddon entered the scene. I don't know, but I have personally never had a problem with his performances as much as the films themselves. He has been in some doozies, which makes The Town that much more surprising.

I loved the movie. The characters are realistic and strong. The plot is thick and believable. There are moments that I couldn't believe I was seeing, as they harkened back to Hitchcock. If you have seen it, I will only say: Tattoo.

Ben Affleck definitely has his team to thank, but after doing some research I found that he himself may be the reason for the impact of many of the character driven scenes. He told his fellow actors to take the lines they were given, and use improvisation to bookend the lines. This worked extremely well. Instead of the usual cookie cutter deliveries typically found in a film like this, we have a series of smooth real-life conversations that play at a pitch perfect level throughout. The characters seem like they know each other, and speak as if they have history together. And then there is the cool Dark Knight vibe...

There are many scenes that I would love to discuss in detail, but unfortunately I would be considered a jerk to those who haven't seen it. Trust me, though the whole film is great, there are five or more scenes specifically that I could write a hundred pages about. Once you've seen it, you'll probably know what I am referring to.

Suspense is a big word and it's hard to find, at least in movies churned out these days. You'll find it here, drawn out tremendously and then kicked up again. I haven't held my breath during a movie in a long while. When you care about the characters, even when they are villains, it's a natural response... Hollywood, ahem.

In closing, go and see it. Good movies need to be supported, and I for one am looking forward to next Affleckian projecto.

The Town is why I go the movies. `Nuff said.",1285718400,3,2643,4.446280991735537
4290109,5,B0049EO108,"I went into this movie knowing absolutely about it, there was little advance hoopla that I can recall, that usually accompanies a  major motion picture.

The idea of mask wearing, semi automatic toting nuns at once seems invigorating and slightly surreal, but the viciousness, and sloppy impulse control of one of the robbers played brilliantly by Jeremy Renner (of Hurt Locker) immediately brings us crashing into  the reality of what's happening.

These hardened  ruthless criminals hide behind a funny mask, and will eliminate anyone who gets in their way.  So they kidnap the attractive female bank manager played adorably by Rebecca Hall for leverage, and let her go.

Upon checking her drivers license, and discovering she lives in their neighborhood, the psycho wants her eliminated to cover their tracks.  Ben Affleck's character takes the card and decides to investigate her, and discover what she knows. One thing leads to another, and the lives of everyone involved starts to move in ever decreasing circles as the FBI investigation starts closing in.

The story is brilliantly told, and the theater audience responded to the irony of the conversations between the criminal and his unknowing victim.

Ben Affleck's character seems a little at odds with his criminal life, and you wonder why he is a bank robber, nevertheless he has a well developed dark side, and is very resourceful, resourceful enough to be the the architect.

But you also get the sense that here is a guy could go straight if he chose to, and that dilemma of wonder is what makes this movie so great.  He makes the good choice of distancing himself from an addicted ex girlfriend, yet makes bad choices as well. But in order to get to that place of going straight he is forced to make criminal but understandable choices, some of which may surprise you.

You can tell that this is somewhat of a passion project.  The movie is set in Boston as was Goodwill Hunting for which he won the Oscar for Best screenplay with Matt Damon.  Here Affleck  shows he is perhaps the under admired element of that partnership as he wears not only a mask but the multiple hats of Director, Actor, and Writer, and as the architect of this movie pulls all those elements together.

The Town is one of those movies that just works on every level, without falling into the trap of just another formula caper movie.  In some ways the mask wearing robbers reminded me of the the Presidential mask wearing robbers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Point-Break-Pure-Adrenaline-Edition/dp/B000GUJZ4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Point Break (Pure Adrenaline Edition)</a>starring Patrick Swayze and Keanu Reeves.

As I think back on the best movies of the last several months I think of the over the top antics in Machete, the intellectual stimulation of Inception, and now the mystery and dilemmas of The Town.  The Town manages to convey some Indie style while not following the typical Hollywood formula.

It would  be remiss not to mention the brilliant ensemble cast, Jon Hamm of Mad Men as the FBI agent,  and Jeremy Renner.  Particularly though I found Rebecca Hall to be an amazing and beautiful talent.  According to the imdb star meter her popularity has risen 570% in the past week.  She also starred as Vicky in the Woody Allen movie Vicky Christina Barcelona, and I predict her star will continue to rise.

If you like this movie I think you will also love&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Point-Break-Blu-ray/dp/B0016MOWP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Point Break [Blu-ray</a>]<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bank-Job/dp/B0019EXZY4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bank Job</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lookout/dp/B000QFCD8Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lookout</a>, a personal favorite.

And at the end of the movie the audience applauded.  I hope this was helpful.  This is definitely one to catch in the theater. I think you will love it.",1285372800,82,4092,5.563812600969305
4290110,3,B0049EO108,"The premise of this film was good, but overall the story fell short.  Well-directed and well-acted, there was no lack of talent behind or in front of the camera.  However, I didn't feel like there was any chemistry between them all to show for it.  It was as if they were each in their own little movie, not really finding cohesion with each other.  Several holes in the plot left huge leaps, or lacks, in logic on MacRay's part, as well as in the overall assumption around the thieves' skills.  It's one thing to establish the premise that Charlestown creates the world's most accomplished thieves, but that they carry automatic weapons, leap rooftop to rooftop to escape an entire precinct of cops, etc, is a bit fantastic.  In places it can't decide to go for drama or action, all the while trying to be a thriller.  All-in-all the film was well shot and keeps your attention, just don't expect more than that.",1285286400,9,913,4.598765432098766
4290111,4,B0049EO108,"""The Town"" is directed by and stars Ben Affleck.  It is filmed on location in Boston, which gives a tough real feel to the story.  Everything  falls into place and grabs the audience primarily because of the cast.  It is a basic cops and robbers movie, but the characters give it new life and intensity.  There are exceptional performances by Jeremy Remmer and Rebecca Hall.  All the characters hold up as solid, intelligent and spots of dark humor bubble through.

This crime story takes place in Charlestown, the guts of Boston.  Ben plays the genius leader of a gang of bank robbers that the cops have been following, but can't get enough evidence for an arrest.  They dance around the threats and harassment as they continue to plan one big heist after another.  Finally, the FBI task force (led by Chris Cooper from Mad Men)  realize that a former female hostage (Rebecca Hall) is the gang's Achilles Heel.  The FBI zoom in on her and see what she knows.  Initially she does not realize that the man she has been seeing was the gang leader.

The film has three heists, and the last heist is at Fenway Park - they enter the cash room dressed as police and steal over $3 million.  There are many good scenes at Fenway Park.

It is a standard cops and robber story, but the cast makes this special and worth watching.",1285027200,,1319,4.5021097046413505
4290112,4,B0049EO108,"""The Town"" is a perfectly adequate crime drama, although it isn't the compelling masterpiece that director, co-writer, and star Ben Affleck was in all likelihood hoping it would be. Perhaps he was too focused on the crime and not focused enough on the drama. Consider the final shootout scene, which in itself is an overused convention; it doesn't quite become boring, but it definitely goes on longer than it should. Watching it, I was well aware of its technical merits, but at the same time, I was disappointed that it wasn't giving me anything I haven't already seen many times before. This is by no means a bad movie. Far from it - the story is both suspenseful and heartfelt, most of the characters are wonderfully developed, and its raw, gritty look effectively establishes mood. I was just hoping for a film that reached a little higher.

Adapted from Chuck Hogan's novel ""Prince of Thieves,"" ""The Town"" is set in Charlestown, Massachusetts, an area of Boston that has the dubious distinction of being the bank robbery capital of the world. We meet career criminals Doug MacRay (Affleck), Jem Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), Albert Magloan (Slaine), and Desmond Elden (Owen Burke) as they pull off yet another heist, guns in hand and concealed by Halloween masks. The bank manager, Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall), is taken hostage by Jem after the silent alarm is tripped, although she's let go after they escape. Fearing she will go to the cops after discovering she lives within proximity of Albert, Jem decides to confront her. Doug, aware that Jem is a bit unstable and capable of making the situation worse, volunteers himself for the job.

And so, as casually as can be, he enters her life, strikes up a friendship, and then - you guessed it - falls in love with her. He stealthily asks her a number of questions relating to the robbery, trying to see how much she knows and whether or not she's likely to squeal. As it turns out, she did notice something about one of the robbers: A fighting Irish tattoo on the back of his neck. She was noticing Jem. In a contrived but nonetheless carefully crafted scene, Jem suddenly joins Doug and Claire as they eat lunch outdoors; Doug is careful to keep Jem's neck out of Claire's sight, even going so far as to feign a hug as he gets up to leave. Having just described this scene, I realize that there's no way to really convey the tension. One must see the film in order to feel the suspense.

Keeping tabs on Doug and his gang is a ruthless FBI agent named Adam Frawley (Jon Hamm), all threatening words and intimidating poses. It's strange - Hamm's performance is about as decent as anyone could hope for, and yet something about his presence in this film doesn't register with me. He didn't seem credible in the role. Perhaps he's too refined for a character so hard boiled, so rough around the edges, so gruff and unpleasant. There's a scene, for example, in which he interrogates Jem's sister and Doug's ex-girlfriend, Krista (Blake Lively), the drug-addicted single mom; his words are stern and insensitive, and yet his expression exhibits nothing but calm and caring, as if he genuinely wanted to help this woman. Either this character was supposed to be a contradiction, or Hamm was both miscast and misdirected. Whatever the case, it doesn't play as well as it should.

Other subplots weave their way into the story. One involves Doug's incarcerated father (Chris Cooper), who's unwilling to help his son find closure over the disappearance of his mother years earlier. Doug would like to believe that she retreated to Florida, where he was told she had relatives. Another involves Irish crime boss Fergie the Florist (Pete Postlethwaite), who sets up one last job for Doug and his gang at Fenway Park. Doug, as would be expected in a movie like this, feels so strongly for Claire that he no longer wants to be a career criminal. Fergie, in his own nasty and cold-hearted way, insists that Doug take part. How it plays out I leave for you to find out. I will say that, given everything that happened up to that point, the ending isn't all that surprising.

I'm sorry to say that I missed Ben Affleck's previous directorial effort, ""Gone Baby Gone."" But on the basis of this film, it's obvious that he knows what he's doing behind the camera. He also knows how to write, or at least co-write, a screenplay, and we need no further proof of this than the Best Original Screenplay Oscar he earned along with Matt Damon for ""Good Will Hunting."" The long and short of it is, ""The Town"" is a perfectly competent film. My hope is that Affleck will strive for something grander in the future. The film goes through the motions, which is to say that it gets the job done but fails to reach for anything beyond the conventions of typical crime dramas. Considering all the hype generated by the studios, considering the talent involved, can you blame me for wishing someone had tried a little harder?",1284940800,,4947,4.688147295742232
4290113,5,B0049EO108,"I've never been a big fan of Ben Affleck, but if this movie doesn't win the Oscar for best picture, it will be a crime. It's every bit as good as past winners like the Hurt Locker and The Departed. It's non-stop action with a love story mixed in, so women will enjoy it as much as men.",1284940800,3,285,3.9310344827586206
4290114,5,B0049EO108,"Ben Affleck does a great job behind the camera and a good one in front of it. The movie is fast paced with great actors, Jeremy Renner as Jem, Jon Hamm as F.B.I. Agent Adam Frawley, Titus Welliver as Dino Ciampa, and Blake Lively really give great performances, but the use of Boston itself is a great supporting part of the movie, the cityscape,Fenway Park, neighborhoods and even narrow roads make the movie standout. It has twist and turns throughout and the cat and mouse game between the robbers and the F.B.I. is top notch. It is over two hours long, so sit down and enjoy it.",1284854400,,582,4.4485981308411215
4290115,4,B0049EO108,"It was not a fluke folks, because it seems that Ben Affleck has some real talent after all. His directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone, was a very strong effort from behind the camera, but this time around he holds his own in front of it as well. It's not a great performance, but it's probably his personal best. Jeremy Renner, fresh off his Oscar nomination for The Hurt Locker, is the standout for me, but Mad Men's Jon Hamm is equally enjoyable in a different way. Blake Lively, of Gossip Girl fame (come on, I've never seen it), shows some real promise as an actress, but she didn't get as much screen time as the hype behind her performance would suggest. Chris Cooper and Pete Postlethwaite are basically give extended cameos, but they both make the most of it and leave a strong impression. Rebecca Hall was okay as the love interest of Ben Affleck's character, even though her role and acting seemed slightly flat at times.

The city of Boston has been depicted well in movies like The Departed and Mystic River, but it comes to life and shines even more bright through Affleck's vision. I even had a little trouble understanding parts of conversations because the accents were that accurate. The story is pretty basic. Kind of like a mini version of Heat, but the locations and acting from just about everyone really draws you in. I can't forget about the action scenes. The bank heists are gritty, realistic, and at times, pretty darn suspenseful. Oh, how effective were those masks? I thought the skeletons were fairly scary enough, but those deformed nun ones freaked me out.

The Town is just as good if not better than Gone Baby Gone. Inception may top my best of 2010 list, but Scott Pilgrim vs. The World and Toy Story 3 better watch their backs, because the more I think about The Town, the higher on my list it aims to climb.",1284768000,6,1839,4.552870090634441
