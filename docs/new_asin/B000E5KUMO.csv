2493918,3,B000E5KUMO,"Surprisingly enough, this is director Stuart Gordon's best work in years. The first half is really atmospheric,while his trademark gore (and camp) soon follows. If you like Gordon (especially if you enjoyed ""Dagon""),this dvd is a must.",1147132800,4,235,5.378378378378378
2493919,5,B000E5KUMO,"It is often whispered amongst horror aficionados that, in spite of H. P. Lovecraft's unquestionable influence on the genre, the works of the venerable horror author are difficult to translate to either the small or large screen.  Nonetheless, director Stuart Gordon (with more than a little help from his screenwriting partner Dennis Paoli) has built his cinematic reputation around his celluloid interpretations of Lovecraft's work.  And though most of Gordon's Lovecraftian films are well made, commercially successful, and popular with genre fans, few (if any) of them are clear reflections of the Lovecraft pieces that inspired them.  At best, Gordon's films use satire to evoke the nihilistic subtext of the author's original work (e.g., Stuart Gordon's 1985 audience favorite RE-ANIMATOR) or pay simple homage via mood, setting, or character monikers (such as Gordon's 1995 direct-to-video CASTLE FREAK or his 2001 opus DAGON).

However, with ""Dreams in the Witch House"" (a.k.a., ""H. P. Lovecraft's Dreams In The Witch House""), Gordon's 2005 entry in Showtime's cable-TV series MASTERS OF HORROR, Gordon comes closer than ever to actually translating a Lovecraft story to film.  True, the director and his writing partner Paoli have still done a bit of creative redacting--most noticeably, the story is moved forward from the 1930's to the present day, and there is the addition of a few high-profile characters--but most of the changes serve only to overcome the characterization shortcomings of Lovecraft's original work.  (Many literary scholars agree that, while it is an engaging piece thematically, ""Dreams in the Witch House"" is not Lovecraft's best literary work in terms of character and style.)  In truth, this film short is, overall, quite faithful to the plot, mood, and theme of the original short story.

Ezra Godden--who genre fans will recognize from his turn as the lead in the aforementioned DAGON--portrays Walter Gilman, a graduate student at Miskatonic University who seeks a quiet, low-rent flat in Arkham, Massachusetts, where he can work on his physics thesis.  In a rather sinister, miasmic house built sometime during the early 17th century, Gilman finds a room that suits his needs and, after dickering a bit with the churlish landlord, he hastily moves in.

Not long after settling into his new digs, Walter notices that the odd angles that make up one particular corner of his room bear a startling resemblance to the inter-dimensional gateway that he is working on in his thesis.  However, by the time Walter finally accepts that his suspicions are correct and that the corner of his room is, indeed, a doorway to another universe, he fears that he may be too late to stop the witch-like creature that has been surreptitiously slipping through the doorway and terrorizing his neighbor (Chelah Horsdal) and her infant child.

In spite of its short run time (55 mins), small budget, and an excruciatingly short production schedule, ""Dreams in the Witch House"" does not come across as a run-of-the-mill made-for-cable film.  Gordon's direction is tight and skillful, drawing upon his experience in both theater and film to create a perfect mood that, while intricate to the narrative, never upstages the actors or the action.  The acting is top-notch, especially that of leads Godden and Horsdal.  Godden is delightful as a nerdy, contemporary Woody-Allen-esque hero, and Horsdal, in spite of her stunning beauty, is able to believably portray a woman who is strong yet still approachable and vulnerable.  Jon Joffin's often breathtaking cinematography also helps belie the film's meager budget, providing provocative visuals, unusual camera angles, and some in-the-camera trickery that are often only seen in studio blockbusters.

Gordon has stated that he avoided the use of CGI in this film because he feels that Hollywood's ubiquitous use of sterile computer FX is beginning to bore audiences.  Instead, ""Dreams in the Witch House"" features old-school puppetry, trained animals, in-the-camera tricks, and real-time lighting effects. Combined with Gordon's signature use of copious gore--not to mention a short nude scene featuring the gorgeous Ms. Horsdal--the film takes on the delightful and refreshing aura of an '80s horror flick, hearkening back to Gordon's earlier films like RE-ANIMATOR while still exuding the his cinematic maturity as a writer/director.

The DVD from the cool folks at Anchor Bay offers a pristine transfer of ""Dreams in the Witch House"" in anamorphic widescreen (1.77:1 aspect ratio).  In addition, the disc offers loads of cool extras, including a feature commentary with director Gordon and actor Godden; interviews with the director and actors; a featurette on Gordon's career as a director of horror films;  DVD-ROM goodies; and more!  Well worth amazon.com's reasonable asking price.

In short, ""Dreams in the Witch House"" is a highly entertaining and notable entry in the horror genre, and it is arguably the best entry hitherto in Showtime's MASTERS OF HORROR series.  Indeed, in spite of its made-for-cable origins, the film rivals many full-length horror films released in theaters these days, and all serious genre fans should consider adding the film to their growing collections.",1147046400,17,5255,5.349514563106796
2493920,3,B000E5KUMO,"This is a GREAT series on TV.....I've enjoyed creeping out to the updated Twighlight Zone type stories.

However....with all the televised series out there, coming out in ""Season Issues""....are we to be expected to pay this kind of money ""Per episode?"" Think I'll wait for the boxed set.",1146960000,4,287,4.979166666666667
2493921,4,B000E5KUMO,"I was pretty impressed with the first episode of Masters of Horror and soon after I started getting myself ready for what was in store next. So for the second episode Showtime premiered 'Dreams in the Witch House'. Directed by Stuart Gordon (Re-Animator, Dagon) Dreams in the Witch House is based on the short story by beloved author HP Lovecraft. In this story we fallow Walter Gilman, a college student who rents out an apartment in a 300 year old building. With very few house mates he settles in what he thought was a quiet apartment. Till he starts having dreams of this talking rat with a human face. He soon realizes that the room he's renting has a small portal to some other form of universe. He then is being haunted by a witch who wants him to spill innocent blood.

I've always been a big fan of Stuart Gorden and his work. His films like Dolls, From Beyond, Dagon and most of all Re-animator have a special place in my heart. I had high expectations for his episode in the Masters of Horror series. Luckily I did hope for the best because I was both impressed and stunned at the same time. I find Gorden's film career to be very impressive and I love his way of film making. His Masters of Horror Episode is based on the story by HP Lovecraft. If you look at Gorden's film list you'll notice that a lot of work the work that he's done were based on HP Lovecraft tales. I honestly believe that he is the right man to adapt such horror literature. Not only does he stay faithful to the original story but he doesn't really seem to soften any up. What surprises me the most about Dreams In the Witch House is that it ends on such a bad note, yet I find myself so attached to the story and characters that it didn't bother me so much.

There's no happy ending to this story and I'm sure that those of you who've read the original story know exactly what I'm talking about. You can call it rude, messed up or evil. I can't argue with that but in some way I see the art to it, in which how far you can push the envelope. I felt that Stuart Gorden pushed it just a tad bit too far, but I still loved Dreams In the Witch House. It's a film that has you focused on the characters and the actual plot that you ignore all the technical aspects of the picture. A lot of the times when I watch horror pictures I look at certain scenes and I would question how they did that effect. This film however had me glued to the screen where I felt sympathy for the characters. I love seeing blood and gore in genre films. Only this time it was the characters and the actual plot that was more rewarding to me.

If you thought the first episode of Masters of Horror was good, then you haven't seen anything yet. This episode is nothing short of entertaining. The story is good and the overall look of the movie is fantastic. We fallow a character who tries to uncover this strange mystery and what he finds isn't pretty. This episode has blood, nudity and some really interesting characters. Overall I thought this was a great film. I didn't really find anything wrong with it. There are hardly any slow or dull parts. There are even a few jumpy moments which I gladly admit really got to me. Its one of those movie moments where you know whats going to happen and you sit there and wait for something scary to pop up. Even when I expected it, it still made me jump and it freaked me out for a split second. Once again if you thought the first episode was good, then you have to check out Dreams in the Witch House. There's more blood and definitely more scares.

The bonus features on this DVD are amazing. Although it's not jam packed with hours of bonus material Anchor Bay gives us exactly what horror viewers want. There's the usual behind the scenes stuff where we see the film in the making. There are also interviews with the cast and crew as well as interviews with actors from Stuart Gorden's previous films. The audio commentary is great but the feature that I enjoyed the most was the interview with Stuart Gorden. I'm guessing that this feature will be on every single DVD. It's a small documentary which Gorden himself talks about his film career. From stage actor to horror icon, you learn about the success and ups and downs from the director himself and that feature alone made me glad to own the DVD.",1146268800,,4309,4.3160493827160495
2493922,4,B000E5KUMO,"I thought Amazon shoppers might appreciate a quick review from someone who was aware of Stuart Gordon and his works, but who hasn't actually gotten around to seeing any of them yet.  This Gordon newbie found ""Dreams in the Witch House"" to be genuinely unsettling and scary, and- just as importantly- well crafted across the board.  I particularly liked how Gordon- while making sure the story doesn't slow to a crawl- gave us a little time in the beginning to get to know and like the main character, as well as get a sense of some of his neighbors in the world's creepiest boarding house.  By getting to know everyone a bit, when the scares come, they have that much more impact.

Like the DVD for ""Cigarette Burns"" (another title in the ""Masters of Horror"" series), this DVD also gives you a ton of stuff in addition to the fifty-some minute main feature.  I particularly enjoyed the interview with Stuart Gordon, which includes many clips from his movies, including ""Re-Animator"", ""From Beyond"", and ""Dagon"".  Knowing of his reputation for over-the-top gore effects, it was fun to see that Gordon is friendly and soft spoken, comes from a community theatre background, and didn't by any means have a particular ambition to do horror films.  But once a set of circumstances fell into place that lead to him making his first film, the still notorious ""Re-Animator"", he said he found his true calling.

Criticisms of this short film?  Not any of consequence.  Maybe a small one: though I'm usually the first person to complain when a film is too ambiguous in the name of being ""artistic"", perhaps ""Dreams in the Witch House"" might have been a tad more creepy if it was ultimately left up to us whether there genuinely was a witch coming and going through the walls of the creepy boarding house or if it was just the college kid imagining it all due to the stresses of his college workload.  It's fine that the film definitely tells you what the truth of the matter is by the end, but I can't help wondering if things would have been better if we didn't know.

But that's a quibble, and one I may even take back upon a second viewing.  But regardless of how I ultimately feel on that one point, I'm sure I'd still have no reservations in recommending the creepy happenings, genuine scares, and shocking gore effects of ""Dreams in the Witch House"".  And I for one am now going to catch up on all those other Stuart Gordon films I've put off for too long.",1146182400,5,2452,4.581235697940503
2493923,1,B000E5KUMO,"The problem I have is not even that Gordon is not 100% faithful to HPL - he fails, utterly and completely to capture anything I associate with Lovecraft.

He can't resist going for tongue-in-cheek.  Thus Brown Jenkin, rather than being disturbing and weird, is just silly and humorous.  The unappealing lead pops his eyes and shrieks like Bruce Campbell in an ""Evil Dead"" movie.  Most of the dream bits were so over-the-top it's impossible for me to think they were meant to be taken seriously (""No one is suppose to see THE NECRONOMICON!!!!!!! EEEEEEEEK!!!! SECURITY!!! SECURITY!!!!!!""  Gimme a break.)

Meanwhile, he fills in the blanks with hoary horror-movie cliches you can find in 20 million direct-to-video shockers at your local video rental joint: blood,  more blood , icky old lady makeup, attempted baby sacrifice, screaming.  YAWN!

When the lead started having a knife-fight with the witch, I threw in the towel.  This has more in common with ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" than anything out of HPL.

Sorry folks, I just don't get it.  Lovecraft was trying to being an innovator.  All Gordon's doing is taking some of HPL's plot and punching it up with the usual mediocre laughs and shocks that pass for horror nowadays.  I thought ""Dagon"" sucked, but this is much, much worse.",1144281600,10,1285,4.916279069767442
2493924,4,B000E5KUMO,"This is an unusually good little horror flick, with those elements of utter wierdness that only Lovecraft adaptations seem to deliver on these days.  This one is unusal for Lovecraft in that it somewhat ties into traditional Christian mythology.

I agree the library scene was almost incongrous and some backstory would have been welcome, especially something from the original story.  But it was fairly faithful in spirit and though fairly slow in the beginning, has a truly horrific bang-up ending.  I rate this one roughly between re-animator and the recent Dagon which I also liked a lot.",1143936000,15,592,5.072164948453608
2493925,4,B000E5KUMO,"I am a big fan of H.P. Lovecraft and I've seen all of the other Lovecraft-inspired films Stuart Gordon has made (Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dagon) so I knew exactly what contect in which this flick ought to be viewed.

This is a marginally faithful retelling of the short story of the same name. Like the other Lovecraft films by Gordon, it has been placed in a distinctly modern setting. If you've read the original tale, you'll understand why they omitted the name of the witch's familiar and if you've seen the other films mentioned here, you will probably not be suprised to know that they modified the tale to appeal to schlock-horror fans. I wish they had explored the background of ""the Witch"" to any degree at all and the ""library scene"" was poorly executed (though with the trademark corniness that makes you laugh out loud). This is pretty much all the criticism I have for this flick. C'mon, man: it's hack and you know you love it!",1143504000,3,942,4.607142857142857
2493969,2,B000E5KUMO,"An adaptation of one of H. P. Lovecraft's lesser works, ""Dreams in the Witch House"" is a MAJOR disappointment.  Director Stuart Gordon squanders what had the makings of a truly chilling, atmospheric horror story by letting it degenerate into a typical blood fest.  There are many good touches here (good acting, good production values), but the film is done in by Gordon's penchant for gore.  Why can't modern filmmakers understand that blood and guts are not frightening, but simply revolting?

Poor Lovecraft must be worn out by turning over in his grave with each new attempt at bringing his stories to the screen.  It is a shame that film directors don't understand or appreciate Lovecraft well enough to create something that will satisfy his enthusiasts rather than pandering to the bloodthirsty fans of slasher movies.",1327622400,2,825,5.0814814814814815
2493970,5,B000E5KUMO,"Soon after student Walter Gilman moves into a low-rent boarding house and makes friends with a lovely, single mother in the same building, he begins to be plagued by nightmares of an old witch and her familiar, a hideous, rat-like creature with a human face. The demonic entities gradually egg him on to do evil deeds, their ultimate goal being the sacrifice of the infant son of Walter's neighbor.

""Dreams in the Witch House"" was the second episode of Showtime's horror anthology series ""Masters of Horror"", this one helmed by ""Re-Animator"" director Stuart Gordon. While I, personally, love horror anthology shows and movies, I admit that I have never had the pleasure of watching this program regularly before. I did catch bits and pieces at a friend's house from time to time, and my reaction was mixed. However, ""Dreams in the Witch House"" was my first time really sitting to watch a full episode (or maybe my second), which, at just under an hour, manages to feel like watching a feature film (not necessarily in a bad way). I have to say, I was very pleased with this one. Stuart Gordon's creepy Lovecraft adaptations, excellent casting, and practical effects continue to entertain and enthrall. Of course, you'll find mixed reactions from real, hardcore Lovecraft fanatics, but if you're just a horror fan with only a light knowledge of Lovecraft, what you'll find here is an entertaining and creepy story that doesn't wimp out on the ending and contains an ugly rat-creature whom you won`t soon forget.

The DVD is pretty impressive, even if I don't like the idea of single episode releases for TV shows (it's kind of acceptable in this case, as they are approximately an hour long and the series is probably a mixed bag). Besides the anamorphic picture and collectible card, there are a ton of bonus features: trailers, galleries, featurettes, and even a great commentary with Gordon and star Ezra Godden. One of the featurettes is a look back at Stuart Gordon's career with interviews from some of his best loved stars (yeah, I'm talking Jeffrey Combs, Ken Foree, and the scrumdiddlyumptious Barbara Crampton).

This is a decent little horror film, but it has the same flaw as so many horror films: characters are required to behave in unbelievable ways in order to reveal information that the viewer needs to make sense of the plot.  More work should have been done to supply important facts in a more organic manner.  It doesn't help that the rat-man (Yevgen Voronin) effects were more ridiculous than frightening; Voronin should not have played it like a rodent from a cartoon.",1309478400,,621,4.951923076923077
2493972,5,B000E5KUMO,"What is there to say about Stuart Gordon that hasn't already been said before?  The man is a genius within the horror film world, creating masterpieces such as ""Re-Animator"", ""Castle Freak"", ""From Beyond"" and another great Masters of Horror film ""The Black Cat"".  One trademark of the man is to turn short stories (mostly Edgar Allen Poe and H.P. Lovecraft) into films, brilliantly done with extreme detail to the source material while still adding his own take on the tales to make them unique and intriguing.

Already satisfied with his past Masters of Horror release, ""The Black Cat"", and deciding to test out ""Dreams in the Witch House"", the film is definitely one of the better short stories within the Masters of Horror collection.  The film begins by depicting a young student by the name of Walter Gilman.  Walter is looking for a cheap place to live while he attends the local University.  He decides to get a room at a local complex which is stated by the landlord to be over 300 years old.  The building is a very run down, dirty place to live, but due to its price, Walter takes it.

Walter spends his time on his laptop, practicing and trying to understand points of interception for fields within the various planes of our world.  He states that it's part of his studies in string theory (a theory meant to combine quantum mechanics and relativity in order to explain the creation of life through small moving strings that vibrate at different frequencies in order to create different forms of matter).  By locating intercepting fields that connect at just the right place and angle, Walter believes that it is possible to enter into other dimensions (alternate dimensions and reality is a crucial part of string theory).

One night, Walter hears his neighbor screaming in the room next door.  He quickly rushes in to assist the woman, who is screaming due to a large rat on the floor that is attempting to bit her and her baby.  After boarding up the wall, Walter and the woman (Frances) begin to become close, while at the same time, the elderly man who lives downstairs warns Walter that the mouse he saw was no ordinary mouse.  Walter goes upstairs to sleep but is awakened by a rat who crawls up his bed and sits on his chest.  Upon opening his eyes, he notices that the rat has a face of a human and is speaking to him telling him ""She's coming, she's coming for you"".

Night after night, Walter is haunted by the rat and its master, an elderly witch who lives within the house in an alternate dimension.  The witch uses deceit to trick Walter into doing her bidding, marking him for her evil deeds.  Once Walter realizes what the witch is truly after, he begins to search for answers and ways in which he can stop her before it's too late.  It's a fight against time, reality, and evil in order to not only save others, but also to save his own soul from the clutch of the witch.

The film stays very true to the story written by H.P. Lovecraft.  Some points were changed in order to make them more ""modern"" such as the addition of the concept of string theory.  The pacing is fantastic, with great build up and suspense.  The cinematography is well done, and transitions between dimensions, sleep and reality are fluid, leaving the viewer just as mystified and curious as Walter himself.  The film uses gore and nudity to a very minimal level, but it is used to enhance the story as needed.  The depictions of the murders within the story are well done, leaving the audience shocked at every turn.  The setting is spectacular, a run down complex that has a haunting tone in every room.  Dim lighting and dark corridors for the building add to the suspense of the film, and the appearance of the witch along with her rat familiar is always sure to build tension.

A great story, very true to its source material, solid environment and great lighting, coupled with well done acting and good pacing, ""Dreams in the Witch House"" is truly a stand out amongst other Masters of Horror films.  The film will mess with the audience's mind just as much as the witch does with Walter's, adding suspense at every scene.  ""Dreams in the Witch House"" is a must have for anyone who's a fan of H.P.

2493978,2,B000E5KUMO,"Masters of Horror: Dreams in the Witch-House (Stuart Gordon, 2005)

Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away, Stuart Gordon made a couple of really loose, really cheesy, but really good, movies based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft. His non-Lovecraft output was always stronger, but Gordon has been riding the rails of Re-Animator and From Beyond for over twenty years now, and shows no signs at all of letting up-- this despite the fact that Gordon, in the space of two years, released both his worst film to date (the Lovecraft adaptation Dagon) and his best (the non-Lovecraftian King of the Ants). You'd think the guy would have learned by now. But no, such is not the case. When the Masters of Horror folk approached him, did Gordon think ""hey, maybe they really liked Dolls!""? Of course not, and so we get another Lovecraft adaptation. Even better, this one is of a story that most Lovecraft fans seem to consider among his worst. When a guy who hasn't made a good Lovecraft adaptation in two decades meets a bad Lovecraft story, there is the potential for a rip of, well, Lovecraftian proportions in the fabric of space-time.

In this one, Walter Gilman (Dagon's Ezra Godden) takes a room in a cheap house with some very odd boarders. He's next door to Frankie (Chelah Horsdal, recently of AvP2) and her infant son Danny. Downstairs is Masurewicz (Campbell Lane), who's lived in the house just about forever, and fears Gilman will see a rat with a human face. Soon enough, the rat appears and tells Gilman that she's coming for him. She who? The witch, of course!

Why Gordon and longtime partner Dennis Paoli saw fit to deviate so widely from the original story is entirely beyond me. It's not like you couldn't make the original with enough nudity (one does not need to change the sex of Gilman's next-door neighbor to throw in a completely unnecessary love story in order to get nudity; there is, after all, a witch involved) or gore (if anything, the climax of the original story is gorier than the climax of the movie), but that seems to have been the thinking here. As well, Gilman himself is turned from the seeker of arcane knowledge in the original story (where Gilman sought out the room because it was in the witch-house) to a hapless dork (who got a room in the witch-house coincidentally because it's the cheapest place in town). Even the Necronomicon bone Gordon throws Lovecraft fans rings entirely false (in the original story, Gilman had consulted the book previous to related events, rather than sleepwalking to the library and somehow getting inside a locked room in a restricted area of the building without knowing what he's doing).

Not, to be kind, one of Gordon's better offerings. **",1206403200,2,2715,4.7094736842105265
2494029,5,B000E5KUMO,"Lovecraft stories in general have never translated well on screen. While some films which are inspired by Lovecraft have fared well, the ones that really attempt to follow the stories just do not capture the richness and inexplicable sense of dread the short stories convey.

This one comes really close and results in a rather scary entry which at least captures the spirit of Lovecraft's tale. The story is set in the modern times and the director, Stuart Gordon, goes to town on the wierdness aspect and the final product did not disappoint.

Certainly one of the best in the MOH series.",1194739200,,590,4.7745098039215685

An interesting aspect of Gordon is told in the interview done with him here on the DVD. Coming from a theatre background, when he first approached doing film he was told to do a horror piece because he could get instant backing. But the board of the Organic Theatre behind him (he was one of its founding members) wanted him to do an art film. Imagine the surprise of critics when he delivered on both counts. He continues to do so to this day. Gordon's piece for this series is entitled ""H.P.Lovecraft's Dreams in the Witch-House"".

The story revolves around Walter Gilman (Ezzra Godden), a young college student named who studies quantum physics and his move into a low rent apartment. The building has two other occupants we know of, a strange man on the first floor across from the landlord and a young woman named Frances and her baby in the room next to Walter's.

Walter is in the midst of writing his thesis, a paper exploring the possibilities of parallel universes that exist on the same level as ours. What he is searching for is the doorways from one into the other. Using his knowledge, he combines angles and planes in his search, one of which bears the uncanny appearance of the corner walls in his room.

A scream in the night finds Walter running to the aid of Frances when a huge rat appears in her room. Saving her and her child from the rat, Walter wakes later that night to a dream of a rat with a human face foreshadowing events to come.

Walter's dreams continue, growing more urgent with each one. Each offers more clues as to what is going on. Eventually he discovers that a witch has used this portal before. But she needs a male human host to help her return. A male who will in turn sacrifice a young child and through its blood allow her to continue on, reaping souls for her master, Satan.

Walter does his best to battle the witch, seeking more information and doing his best to find a way to close the door. The last pieces he receives come from the old man downstairs who tried to warn him earlier. The old man was marked years before and had done what Walter may now find himself doing, killing a child.

Rent this one and find out if Walter can overcome his nightmares or if he will succumb to what the witch has intended for him. The film is definitely for adults, featuring nudity and enough gore to keep fans of those sorts of special effects happy. But for Lovecraft and Gordon fans, the film features enough story to go around, more than most films can say these days and especially horror films.

No mere naked teens cavorting around waiting for the next slasher franchise. This film has its roots in the tales of Lovecraft, tales of the Necromonicon. It looks at witchcraft from the past filled with blood soaked images and child sacrifices. Stephen King once said that the most terrifying thing for him was something happening to his children. Child sacrifices run rampant with this fear. And Gordon has taken Lovecraft's turn on this fear as well as his witchcraft lore and made one chilling tale.",1191283200,,3442,4.531400966183575
2494031,2,B000E5KUMO,"Walter (Godden) is a graduate student at Miskatonic University, studying String Theory. He's broke and in need of a quiet place to live and study while he finishes up his dissertation. He finds a room for rent in an old, run-down house which has been divided into apartments. It's not pretty, there's a strange man, Masurewicz (Lane), living in apartment two, and the manager, Dombrowski (Brazeau), is a jerk, but it's cheap, so Walter takes it. He soon befriends the woman living in apartment three--Frances (Horsdal)--by chasing off the rat that was menacing her and her baby.

But, as one might expect in this situation, strange things start happening. First, Walter hears some strange banging noises and religious chanting one night. Then, he has some very strange dreams--first, of a rat with a human face, that warns him ""she"" is coming for him. But that's not all. Walter's thesis involves a theory that says if you know where two planes of existence intersect, then you can figure out how to travel from one dimension to the other. And Walter soon discovers that the oddly formed corner of his room is structured like the model in his String Theory work.

Walter's dreams become progressively more and more disturbing and vivid, and Masurewicz, who has lived in the house for nearly his entire life, provides some dire warnings about the sort of thing that goes on there. But these warnings don't do Walter any good, as he finds himself under the thrall of a powerful witch, who is intent on sacrificing Frances's baby...and using Walter as her instrument to do it.

Dreams in the Witch-House was a good choice to adapt, and Stuart Gordon, on paper at least, was a good choice of director--after all, he'd directed two previous adaptations of Lovecraft's work: Re-Animator and Dagon. However, Gordon is more of a ""master of schlock"" than a true master of horror. There's very little that's scary or terrifying here; Gordon's ham-handed filmmaking style robs Lovecraft's story of most of its visceral power.

The mediocre acting of Godden (Walter) doesn't help much either. He's sufficient as the lead when he's just playing the part of the poor college student, but when things start turning hairy and the real horrific elements start making themselves known, all the requisite emoting and reacting are rather beyond his range. Who knows though, he might be capable of real acting; I expect Gordon directed him to act the way he does since it plays into the whole schlock feel the film seems to be going for.

Horsdal and Lane, meanwhile, are solid in their supporting roles, Horsdal as the innocent, down-on-her-luck single mother, Lane as the crazy old man with prophecies of doom. Brazeau chews scenery as the apartment manager, but his role doesn't make or break the film.

There seems to be a large community of horror fans who actually seem to prefer this style of horror filmmaking, so for them this episode might be a big hit. I admit I don't get it. There are also people who still prefer the super-pulpy SF adventure stories of the Golden Age era (the ones devoid of characterization), and I don't get that either. But for the most part print SF has moved beyond that, just as print horror has moved beyond the cheesy/cheap scare. Why is it that Hollywood so often seems out of sync with literature?

It may sound as if I'm being needlessly harsh with Gordon, but the episode is just good enough for the viewer to see what it could have been if it were in the hands of a more competent director, and such films are often more frustrating than those that are complete train wrecks.

For a DVD that's only one episode of a television series, this disc is loaded with extras. It includes commentary by Gordon and Godden, five featurettes, a text biography of Stuart Gordon, and still (yawn) and storyboard galleries (double-yawn).

The disc also features some DVD-ROM extras, including: the episode's screenplay and the complete text of H.P. Lovecraft's original short story (both in PDF format), along with a screensaver, which is basically a slide show trailer for the episode (with music).

The featurettes all serve their purpose, and fans of the episode and/or Stuart Gordon in general will be in heaven. Listening to Gordon speak about filmmaking and horror, it's easy to see why he was chosen to direct this episode. He sounds passionate about Lovecraft and horror, and seems like a sharp guy. But passion and sharpness will only take you so far. In the interview, Gordon also mentions that he wasn't able to get into the only filmmaking class offered by his college; it's shame, really--perhaps there he would have learned the difference between quality and schlock.",1188691200,,5319,4.998870056497175
2494032,5,B000E5KUMO,"This is by far my favorite of the Masters of Horror series to date. Although, my opinion may be biased since I am also a fan of the works of H.P. Lovecraft.

Dreams in the Witch House is a story of a college student who moves into a cheap boarding house so he can concentrate on his college studies. This house turns out to be haunted by an ancient witch named Keziah and her familiar Brown Jenkin, a rat with the face of a man, both of whom can travel across dimensional plains.

Keziah and Brown Jenkin travel through a dimensional barrier and summon the student, Gilman, in his dreams. During these dreams, they prepare him for a pagan ritual that involves the sacrificial murder of an infant. And wouldn't you know it, Gilman's neighbor is a single mother with a, that's right, an infant child.

All in all, I think it's a very good adaptation of Lovecraft's original story, I especially liked the addition of a female protagonist that serves as Gilman's friend (and object of desire), as well as the infant's mother. This character is not found in Lovecraft's original story, but that is typical of most of Lovecraft's work. Female characters with any kind of real depth are almost non-existant in Lovecraft's fiction, which makes his work somewhat one-sided. That is why I enjoy this adaptation so much.",1188691200,,1309,4.658008658008658
2494033,1,B000E5KUMO,"Stuart Gordon is perhaps most famous for his skilled adaptation of Lovecraft's story, ""Re-Animator.""  That movie is an excellent example of how mordantly dark comedy and horror can be blended into a fine cinematic concoction.  Most recently, however, Gordon put ""Edmond,"" a Mamet play, on the big screen, and the result was a jumbled sociological treatise without brains, a tapestry of symbols without referrents.  Basically, bad filmmaking.

He directed this installment of the Showtime series at around the same time with almost exactly the same results.  ""Dreams"" is another Lovecraft tale, this time about a physics student named Walter Gilman (Ezra Godden, who was also in Gordon's ""Dagon"").  Being a typically-poor graduate student, Walter moves into a squalid attic apartment and finds himself plagued by horrible dreams, dark premonitions, and a rat with a human face.

Fans of Lovecraft and Gordon may defend this short film (and it seems many have), but if you don't have a prefabricated love for the story or its director, I'm afraid the only thing to like here is Godden's head's-first portrayal of Walter (and, for those with prurient tastes, some full-frontal witch nudity).  Everything else -- the mood, the directing, the production values, the dialogue -- it's all abysmally bad, watered-down and uninspired.

The story, altered to suit time (and perhaps monetary) constraints, is an unconvincing mess.  It's hard to pin-point why, exactly.  It might be the preponderance of stock characters, or it might be the laughable effects (the several close-ups of the man-rat made me wonder if I wasn't watching a comedy).  Whatever it is, it definitely has something to do with the story-telling.  The plot crumbles as it lengthens, fumbling frantically for some degree of menace but coming up, instead, with handfuls of foolishness.  Ultimately, ""Dreams"" makes about as much sense as an actual dream and is just as substantial.  You'd probably be better entertained if you just took a nap.",1174867200,2,2000,5.225705329153605
2494034,4,B000E5KUMO,"Stuart Gordon, best known for the low-budget shocker classic Re-Animator, not to mention many adaptations of H.P. Lovecraft horror yarns, brings another one to life for Showtime's Masters of Horror.  Dreams in the Witch House re-unites Gordon and his Dagon star Ezra Godden as Godden plays a physics student renting a dingy room in an old house that also has a single mother and a seemingly crazy religious old man as tenants as well.  Soon enough, he's having dreams of a human faced talking rat and an evil witch that wants the baby's blood, and plans on using him as a method to make it happen.  For most of it's running time, Dreams in the Witch House is a compelling and inventive horror yarn that makes the most of it's source material, and the shocker ending sets it apart from other episodes in the series.  Once again, the gore and makeup effects are superbly done by KNB, which just makes the package all the sweeter.  All in all, Dreams in the Witch House is one of the best episodes in Showtime's horror anthology series, and for Lovecraft fans this should prove enjoyable as well.",1160265600,4,1093,4.61340206185567
2494035,2,B000E5KUMO,"Look I'll be honest...this isn't just terrible.  It's just boring as hell with no real build-up.  The direction wasn't bad, you actually enjoy watching the characters---but the script wasn't that polished and the special effects were pretty crappy.  But this IS Stuart Gordon we're talking about.

Worth watching?  Sure.  But probably the worst that I've seen from the ""Masters of Horror"" line.

""Dagon"" was pretty sweet though.",1153612800,3,428,5.298507462686567
2494036,4,B000E5KUMO,"Since Amazon decided not to post my review of the recent Beyond The Wall Of Sleep(which was rotten by the way), I figured the next best thing would be to review another recent Lovecraft adaptation.  The Masters Of Horror series is really a wonderful thing.  No Hollywood b.s., just let the director loose.  Naturally, involving Stuart Gordon was a no-brainer coz he's definitely earned the ""Master Of Horror"" title.  As we all know, Gordon's got a passion for Lovecraft and tends to do above average B movie versions of his stories.  Like any other director who's tackled Lovecraft, Gordon doesn't get it 100% accurate(I doubt any director ever will, but the recent Call Of Cthulhu film by the Lovecraft Preservation Society shows enormous promise).  Gordon tends to update the stories to modern times, adding to and taking away elements from the original story.  In most horror fans' eyes, this is okay coz the movies are good enough to stand on their own even though they may not be accurate.  Dreams In The Witch House may never surpass Re-Animator or From Beyond, but it's what you'd expect from Gordon.  It's solid, well acted, gory, and the fx are pretty good considering the budget, which looks to be on a direct-to-video level.  Ezra Godden, who was also the lead in Gordon's Dagon is really starting to grown on me.  I kind of had mixed feelings on him when I saw Dagon, but I'm actually starting to like the guy.  The story maintains the basic plot of the Lovecraft story.  Godden's character's motives are different from the character in the story's(the guy in the story is actually looking for the witch as opposed to just stumbling upon her) and the woman next door to Godden is an entirely new character.  Lovecraft's stories rarely have dialogue and character development, so it's up to Gordon to give personalities to the landlord and downstairs neighbor.  Whether he does a good job with this is totally up to the viewer, but I'll say this is a pretty good adaptation.  It's a helluva lot better than Beyond The Wall Of Sleep, I'll tell you that!!",1150848000,6,2064,4.739495798319328
2494037,4,B000E5KUMO,"John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, Dario Argento, Joe Dante, Don Coscarelli, Takashi Miike.  These are but some of the powerhouse names in horror that were enlisted to direct episodes of ""Masters of Horror"", a 13-episode series that debuted last fall on the Showtime network.  Comparisons to other TV horror anthologies such as Tales from the Crypt, Twilight Zone and Friday the 13th were inevitably made but ""Masters"" decidedly differs from those in several aspects as there is no host, no commercials and little trace of humour/camp.  No, Masters of Horror is a no-holds barred hardcore horror anthology that gives full creative freedom to its directors, many of them names that have been known to not pull any punches whatsoever.

What I particularly like about the show is that there is no guiding voice, or TV producer, telling the director how things should be.  Each episode has the director's own personal stamp on it, to give us the feeling that ""This is not a masters of horror episode, it's a Dario Argento movie, or a Takashi Miike movie, etc.""  The result of this creative freedom and unique concept is an anthology where every episode feels uniquely distinct from one another.

""Dreams in the witch house"" is an adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft short story directed by, you guessed it, Stuart Gordon.  Gordon has made a career out of adapting Lovecraft, whose tales most thought were nearly impossible to translate to cinema.  Well, Gordon has done a solid job over the years having helmed the all-time horror classic ""Reanimator"" as well as other solid Lovecraft-inspired films such as ""From Beyond"", ""Castle Freak"" and ""Dagon"".

Story: Walter Gilman is a graduate student of inter-dimensional string theory in need of a cheap room to rent.  His search leads him to a decrepit 300 year-old house in the New England town of Arkham.  Walter is soon haunted by terrifying nightmares involving a rat with a human head, a witch and Satanists.  As Walter's sanity begins to disintegrate, he believes his string theory studies have uncovered a portal into a parallel universe full of diabolical forces who are intent on killing his roommate's infant child.  As the story unfolds Walter struggles to understand what differentiates dream from reality and whether he's losing his sanity.

Gordon proves once again that he's the premier adapter of Lovecraft stories with this dreamy, surreal short film.  I found the concept to be fascinating and the lead to be engaging, unlike the bozo who played the lead in Carpenter's Cigarette Burns, this guy can actually act.  Gordon doesn't waste any time with slow development and throws us head-first into his nightmare world.  He achieves great atmosphere despite what was obviously a limited budget.  What I most liked about ""Witch House"" is that unlike other surrealist films, you're not left guessing at the end what is real or not or if the whole darn thing was a dream.  No, Gordon instead rewards our patience with a full explanation and closure at the end and the truth is quite the shocker!  This is pure Gordon, and a treat for his fans as well as fans of Lovecraft.",1150848000,3,3117,4.921606118546845
2494038,5,B000E5KUMO,"This a terrific adaptation of Lovecraft's work. Gordon definitely delivers the goods on it. It helps to be familiar with the writings of HP Lovecraft or this would appear to be dumb. Then again HPL does not appeal to everyone.

8106076,5,B000E5KUMO,"One of my favorite H.P. Lovecraft movie adaptations!  I really like how Stuart Gordon worked in the concept of the physic's M-Theory into this movie.  H.P. Lovecraft's horror stories seem so far out there that many fail to realize that ""The old Ones"" are mentioned in the Bible & Moloch & Dagon were actually worshipped in great antiquity!  I discovered H. P. Lovecraft through Robert E. Howard, they were contemporary's & corresponded by mail.  Both authors wrote horror based on the Cthulu mythos. Author Stephen King also joined the club so to speak with his short story Crouch End.  One thing every H.P. Lovecraft fan knows is its hard to translate his visions of horror to the big screen & becomes used to alterations.  Stuart Gordon seems to be one of the best at bringing Lovecraft tales to the big screen & mercifully adds some humor that is not in the mind bending stories of Lovecraft.  ""Dreams in the Witch House"" has less comic relief than other Gordon / Lovecraft interpretations & ranks near the top of the all time scariest movies, especially if  you believe practitioners of the black occult are still practicing their evil arts!  Alistair Crowley's Grimoir ""The Lesser Key of Solomon"" is still selling thousands of copies a year!  Scary!!!  And the physicist at C.E.R.N. are trying their hardest to open forbidden doorways!!!

8106083,3,B000E5KUMO,"Like Edgar Allen Poe, H.P. Lovecraft is a writer whose essence is always trying to be captured by film makers, all with widely varying degrees of success. This outing is more than watchable.

Here's the scoop. A college graduate student rents a room in an eerie, 300 year old house. As his discipline is physics, certain angles in the house correspond to trajectories he's working on in his thesis. He wonders if he's sitting on a portal to another dimension. That he begins having weird nightmares, seeing rats with faces, and getting his back torn to shreds by a witch is not helping matters. Is this all really happening or is he just really stressed out?

This is not the director, Stuart Gordon's, first outing with Lovecraft. He's a fan and he does his best. Here, I think he suffered under a time restraint. This is a made for TV flick clocking in at just under an hour. It moves quite smoothly in action and tone up until the very end where it starts to feel like a rush job. I haven't read the original story, and it's obviously been updated, but they do a decent job of trying to capture the Lovecraftian mood. The landlord is quite the cliche but the other roles are written and performed well. You like the hero and his fetching next door neighbor. You have hope for them. The steps leading to the hero's madness are cool and the end is a surprise. They just needed one or two more scenes to smooth it all out.

This is more three and a half than the three stars I gave it. If you're a horror fan you can feel comfortable watching this.",1334620800,,1548,4.386759581881533
