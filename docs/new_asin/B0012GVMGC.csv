3089190,1,B0012GVMGC,Can you say boring! I was hoping for more visuals of actual autopsys rather than the dry facts about people who have been gone for a long time.,1363910400,5,143,4.142857142857143
3089191,5,B0012GVMGC,"As will all the episodes in the Autopsy series, this one a masterpiece of all things forensic.  Dr. Baden is the ultimate 'who done it' guy in a forensic science form. Listening to him talk is just as intriguing as the work he does. Adding in that classic Autopsy background music can make you downright jumpy with chills.

Why has HBO not released the entire series (1-8) on DVD? That's very baffling since all are excellent.",1284163200,9,426,4.592105263157895
3089192,5,B0012GVMGC,"I already owed the other ""Autopsy"" DVD availabe and my students loved it and wanted to see another so I purchased this video for my Forensics class to supplement course materials. It is an interesting mix of historical fact and forensics content. My students were engaged during the entire film and were actually upset when it ended (and not just because they did not have a movie to watch any more!)
The content is graphic, but appropriate given the subject matter and prompted some excellent classroom discussions. Dr. Baden is clear in his explainations and interesting to listen to. I can only hope they will make more of these series available on DVD!",1278374400,15,656,4.814159292035399

3089204,4,B0012GVMGC,I'm really a big fan of the show since it's inception but found this dvd kind of blah.

8245922,4,B0012GVMGC,"A very interesting look at long ago autopsy cases.  I do have two small quibbles.  The first one is that while Dr. Baden is very knowledgeable this particular episode is presented as very ""Monday Morning Quarterback"" .  It is always so easy for a person who is not in the moment and required to make snap decisions to come in and criticize other people's work.  The second issue I had was the woman narrator's voice.  It was so droll it annoyed me to no end.  I will be watching other episodes in this series though.",1459641600,,516,4.378947368421053
