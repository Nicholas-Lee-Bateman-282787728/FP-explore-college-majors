7983932,5,B00008GKHG,"Very easy reading, interesting and Historically accurate.  It gives a very complete view of the History, the context and the details of the evolution of the swiss guards, wich by the way, are again responsible of the smooth transition with the new Pope...",1362096000,,255,4.930232558139535
7983933,4,B00008GKHG,"The Swiss Guard? The Vatican? The Pope's Soldiers? How does all this fit together? I'm still not sure. But how interesting even for a non-catholic.
I thought it was well done and informative. The Pope has meetings with most of the head world leaders.",1243728000,,250,4.704545454545454
7983934,5,B00008GKHG,Outstanding documentary on the history and structure of the elite soldiers/secret service agents who swear to protect the Pope with their lives.,1227052800,3,144,5.590909090909091
7983935,3,B00008GKHG,"This almost felt like a recruitment tool for the military or an all-male college.  However, only a few men can join this guard.  This documentary may get visitors to Rome prepared for one of the sites they may see on their trip to the Vatican.

Though Switzerland is trilingual, one never sees these Swiss men speaking French, they speak mostly German or some Italian.  It was unique to hear individuals speaking English as a second language.  One person pronounces the English v like an English w; here's a Western European doing what is thought of as the action of an Eastern European.  One person stated, ""You can have a cup with your peers.""  Fluent Anglophones would have said ""a cup OF WINE"" or ""a drink.""

This work may feel dated in that the pope who died a few years ago is shown, rather than the latest pope.  These soldiers are not ethnically diverse.  In the same way that some argued that the new pope should be from outside of Europe, some could argue that the Catholic population is diverse and only showing whites or giving positions to whites may be a problem.  As Switzerland becomes more diverse through immigration and interracial marriage, maybe there will be guards of color in decades to come.",1187308800,4,1216,4.661971830985915
7983936,5,B00008GKHG,"Warm, personable picture of these ""soldiers of the Pope"" with historical aspects.  The young men's dedication and commitment is well portrayed, as well as true insight into their training and daily tasking.  Pope JPII's appreciation of their service and the soldiers' families is part of this portrayal, especially the Pope's personal visits at their special Vatican Christmas celebrations. It is a well done portrait of the behind-the-scenes protection of the Pope in the Vatican.",1182902400,,481,5.486486486486487
