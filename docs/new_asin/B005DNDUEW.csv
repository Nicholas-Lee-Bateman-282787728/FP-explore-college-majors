4661268,5,B005DNDUEW,"If you are interested in Hans Hofmann, read Hans Hofmann: Color Creates Light by Tina Dickey, then watch this video. PBS has provided fascinating insight into Hofmann's painting and teaching with primary footage of Hofmann at work, and interviews with his students. As a bonus, you get to see the work of his students, and can see Hofmann's influence in their work.",1373241600,4,365,4.903225806451613
4661269,5,B005DNDUEW,"This movie is a gift to anyone who appreciates modern art. Hofman was both artist and teacher, and many of the greats studied under him, including Wolf Kahn. This documentary features many of his students, including Kahn, discussing his technique and sharing how he influenced their work. Highly recommend.",1362441600,5,306,5.26530612244898
4661270,5,B005DNDUEW,"I used this video in a recent workshop I taught on ""Shape and Form as Subject."" The advanced artist-participants in the workshop were able to see and hear about one of the originators of this language of non-representational painting. For this purpose, the video was simply SUPERB!",1093910400,9,281,5.0
4661271,4,B005DNDUEW,"Hofmann is a talented artist and was probably a good teacher.  The film does not, however, teach his methods.  It covers the results and alludes to a ""push-pull"" strategy, but I had to research books to fill in the missing parts.",1438214400,2,229,4.560975609756097
4661272,5,B005DNDUEW,"Hans Hofmann: Artist/Teacher, Teacher/Artist is an assemblage of historic footage shot at his various schools (mostly silent footage) and interviews with several of his students--all of whom are mature artists at the time the movie was shot. Through their anecdotes and passionate descriptions of Hofmann's ""Push-Pull"" theories, we come to understand how amazing Hofmann was as a teacher and artist. While this documentary is not (and could not be) Hofmann talking directly to me as the viewer, I am grateful for the voyeuristic look at his studio classes and the second-hand insights shared by so many of his students. Perhaps most importantly, the movie helped me understand that Hofmann's painted his most significant works during his 70s and 80s. Although he has been gone nearly a half-century, Hofmann's paintings and life continue to inspire.",1432425600,2,849,5.343283582089552
4661273,4,B005DNDUEW,Interesting movie about him and this period,1420675200,,43,5.285714285714286
4661274,5,B005DNDUEW,Excellent !!,1418860800,,12,5.5
4661275,5,B005DNDUEW,Wow!!!  Wish we had teachers like this today.,1409270400,,45,4.625
4661276,5,B005DNDUEW,This man made thick paint look like light filled spaces - like glazes instead of mixed colors. Incredible look into his life and teaching.,1407283200,,138,4.791666666666667
4661277,3,B005DNDUEW,"The video was a history of Han Hofmann and did show some of his paintings and emphasized that the painting had areas that would visually pop out and recede giving motion to the paintings. But there was no information about Hofmann's techniques, color theory, composition or how he achieved the movement in the paintings.

Hofmann's history was interesting but I was looking for more technical information.",1402358400,9,405,5.136363636363637
4661278,5,B005DNDUEW,"Hofmann was a giant as a painter, up there with Matisse and Picasso.  Additionally  he was an amazing teacher who generously  shared his  knowledge with innumerable students over the years.  Hofmann created an unique verbal vocabulary to express his ideas about pictorial and plastic relationships. .  His influence lives on in his students and their students. I was fortunate enough to study  with Hofmann  students James and Nieves Billmyer. This film brought back treasured memories of Bill and Nieves.  It was a great  joy to see so many Hofmann paintings and drawings. The film was well researched and narrated.  I highly recommend it.",1402099200,6,640,5.116504854368932
4661279,2,B005DNDUEW,"barely anything in this video but air. A handful of quotes is all you get of Hofmann's teachings, a shame. Not even a good viewing of his work.",1394668800,4,143,4.142857142857143
4661280,5,B005DNDUEW,Very interesting vid and I learned a lot from it Hans Hoffman is keel dude and a great teacher nice!,1385683200,,100,4.05
8467227,3,B005DNDUEW,"It is excellent background information on a famous artist and teacher we all love and admire, however, the video needs some additional editing aesthetically..",1510358400,,158,5.625
8467228,4,B005DNDUEW,"This DVD offers good insights on Hofmann's teaching style but insights into his own paintings or his life story are very few (at least until the last 20 minutes when we're finally told more about the work). It does show examples of his paintings - I only wish they had been captioned so that viewers can at least research online the ones they found the most compelling. I did enjoy the documentary, though. I first discovered Hofmann in the pages of ""New Art City"" by Jed Perl many years ago and this DVD offers a good complement to the information in the book. What is really missing in the DVD is some explanation of Hofmann's paintings: how they evolved over the years, how did he choose the colors, how did he work to create them. In the DVD the filmmakers show his students painting abstract art from a real-life model and a still life. Was it how Hofmann created his paintings too? But in the second half of the documentary there is a bit of footage of him painting, and also footage of his house in Provincetown (he painted everything in bright colors). Just to show the lack of attention given to his personal life, we go from Hofmann arriving in the US starting his school in Provincetown to, after half an hour about his school, being told of an argument Hofmann, now old, had with his wife. One minute spent on telling us his wife's name and how they met does seem like legitimate information for viewers to have. But I suppose the filmmakers were constrained by time, and they pack a lot of art into 55 minutes. A worthy purchase.",1486252800,,1542,4.471631205673759
8467229,3,B005DNDUEW,"OBNOXIOUS BACKGROUND MUSIC THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NARRATION. When there was an absence of background music I assumed I had gone deaf. Lovely to listen to on its own, I'm sure, but not when you're trying to follow the soft-spoken narration. Cringeworthy combination. Was tempted to turn it off multiple times. Stuck with it but now I have a migraine.",1482192000,,348,4.915254237288136
8467230,5,B005DNDUEW,Beautiful in depth look at the many artists Hofmann influenced / inspired. Packed with interviews and images of Hofmann's paintings. Highly recommended.,1479600000,,152,5.954545454545454
8467231,5,B005DNDUEW,My favorite painter. He was a great teacher and artist.,1467676800,,55,4.6
8467232,5,B005DNDUEW,Wonderful teacher. Wish I could have studied with him!,1467072000,,54,5.111111111111111
8467233,3,B005DNDUEW,"Fascinating! I did not know anything about Hoffman. I recommend it to artists. If you are not interested in art, I don't think you will enjoy it. If you love art, I think you will.
Interesting tidbit-he taught art to Robert De Niro's father.",1464566400,,241,4.5
8467234,5,B005DNDUEW,Wonderful film - an insightful look at a major influence on modern art.,1448409600,,71,4.538461538461538
8467235,1,B005DNDUEW,wouldn't play.  Couldn't tell if is good or not.  Still want to see it,1440374400,,70,3.9285714285714284
8467236,3,B005DNDUEW,"Watched the $2.99 version, generally low quality video. A little more thorough exploration of Hofmann's ideas would be desirable.",1439164800,,129,5.842105263157895
