8511635,2,B0077AYMDW,"Fever Night aka Band of Satanic Outsiders (Jordan Harris and Andrew Schrader, 2009)

I have not seen Band of Outsiders, the Godard film from which Fever Night obviously derives its subtitle, and thus it would be very difficult for me to compare and contrast the two. And yet what I know of Godard films definitely strikes a chord when I watch Fever Night; there's the same general plotlessness, the same overacting, the same feeling of discontinuity from scene to scene. And I have to say that I like it better here than I do in Godard, but not much.

I think there's a plot, kind of, and I think it goes like this: three Satanists, Elliot (Peter Tullio in his first screen appearance), Warren (Doilie's Diner's Philip Marlatt), and Terry (Poker Run's Melanie Wilson, also debuting), head out into the woods to conduct some sort of ritual. (The director's synopsis on IMDB says they actually go through with it; if so, it's a very subtle ritual, because I didn't even notice.) Then Terry disappears. While Elliot and Warren are trying to figure that out, they see a dim light through the trees and pursue it, hoping to find some help (or Terry, maybe).

...and the majority of the movie is Elliot and Warren following this light and arguing with one another. If that's not Godardian, I don't know what is. Horrid memories of forcing myself to sit through Pierrot le Fou, but if both of the main actors were male. And not in a car. Wilson is cute, though for obvious reasons she doesn't get a great deal of screen time, and there are some mildly amusing bits (which is better than I can say for Godard), but overall, this one will confuse you while boring you senseless at the same time. * ",1354406400,2,1689,4.564356435643564
8511636,1,B0077AYMDW,"Never have I wanted to bail on a movie as much as I wanted to bail on this one.  It was obvious from the very first second that Fever Night aka Band of Satanic Outsiders was going to be a thoroughly miserable viewing experience - and it got worse every single second.  The three main characters are instantly unlikeable, and the co-directors' pretentious way of blocking scenes and using odd, extreme close-ups is the equivalent of someone running their nails across a blackboard for almost an hour and a half.  Then, of course, you have several artsy-fartsy psychedelic montages thrown in here and there that - no matter what the directors might think - only highlight the complete lack of talent that went in to the making of this horribly bad movie.  Speaking of no talent, Peter Tullio and Philip Marlatt may be the worst actors I've ever seen in my life.  It doesn't help that the inane script gives them absolutely nothing to work with.  You can't even enjoy the brief sight of Melanie Wilson's, uh, assets because it's followed up with the sight of the last person on earth who should ever appear naked.

Three dumb kids with aspirations of Satanism go out into the woods, burn some stuff while performing Touchdown signals, and then wind up wandering around the middle of nowhere after the girl meets with an accident.  Unfortunately, the guys meet up again to torture the viewer with horrible dialogue, and then weird things happen to them.  Seriously, there's almost no story here whatsoever.  It's like a group of friends somehow got their hands on forty grand (this film's budget), spent every cent of it on pot, and then decided to go out into the woods and make a movie while they were still wasted out of their minds.  As far as I'm concerned that's the only possible explanation for this movie's existence.",1348531200,4,1822,4.69811320754717
8511637,1,B0077AYMDW,"This was the slowest, cheapest, more boring movie I have ever bought, and I have over 1,600 movies.  When you read the description, you think that at least you will see the actors performing the satanic ritual that gets them into trouble. You don't. They go for a ride into the hills. After that, you watch them un-die through what seems like a painfully slow moving 2 hour acid trip.  I don't think I'll even give this movie away to get rid of it: it's going into the round file.",1337385600,2,480,4.322222222222222
