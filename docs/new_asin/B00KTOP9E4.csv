6446275,2,B00KTOP9E4,"Reminds me of that one show Dan Aykroyd did about aliens. The whole thing was made to look serious. And to 'some' peoples surprise it was one long joke making fun of the types of people that get into this kind of thing. One long troll video and it was hilarious. The best comedy Dan has ever made.
This is not that movie. This is just funny for very different reasons.",1425600000,2,368,4.197183098591549

You say you don't believe in Bigfoot, but hundreds of researchers in the field cant be ignored any more.
Bigfoot is real and the evidence is in!
Over 20 researchers and witnesses have come together to present some of their greatest findings in support of this elusive creature that was mostly, until now, believed to be mythical. Evidence such as tracks, stick and rock formations, sound recordings, video of the creature, and more are presented to the viewer. And the evidence comes from all over North America. So sit back, watch, listen, and prepare to Believe!""",1424217600,4,639,4.7657657657657655

6446286,5,B00KTOP9E4,"I have seen some of the reviews on this that imply that this little film is not professionally made. Well, I agree that the transitions and music and interview styles are not as sophisticated as all the other Bigfoot documentaries that are being produced these days yet, this film adds something. This film actually has some credible photo work, field work and just an overall nice body of information to offer. So, for that reason and because they do not seem to have a high level of b.s. involved in their presentation, I gave it 5 stars. I enjoyed each segment and loved the photos from those claiming to have a habituation area. Also, their photos of intrinsic stick figures and structures in the woods was the best I have seen to date.",1458172800,8,740,4.571428571428571
6446287,4,B00KTOP9E4,Not a bad film. Im glad it has some substance and not a bunch of fluff with a Hollywood cast and set.  I look for documentaries on the subject not docu-drama or horror films.  Im glad someone out there is pushing for new info on the subject and not a block buster film. I do research on my own and have my group.  Thanks alot Arla Collett and others for putting this together.,1449878400,5,376,4.123287671232877

8661479,5,B00KTOP9E4,"I enjoyed it. Love anything Bigfoot really. I wish there was an update of the guy interacting with the""Bigfoot"" in the woods. I was waiting for some movement in the far right coming up the slop. Keep up the research. It will only get better. Thanks",1514764800,,248,4.413043478260869

8661481,1,B00KTOP9E4,"I want to say congratulations to the makers of this.  This video single handedly brings incredulity to the subject of Sasquatch. The photos go beyond blurry, the narration is straight out of O Brother, Where Art Thou? The evidence presented is just bad. Holding a clump of plaster and calling it a Bigfoot track is embarrassing. Yes there was a four toed cast but it looked uber fake, much like the grunting of the sounds.  I'm posting my own Bigfoot evidence which is everybit on par with the evidence you'll see in this flick.",1504742400,3,528,4.6063829787234045

8661483,3,B00KTOP9E4,"There's some good evidence but it's very low budget so it's hard to watch. Also, the person who is narrating is stumbling through the script at points. It's also got nothing new in it. However, it's not horrible!",1497657600,,212,4.605263157894737
8661484,4,B00KTOP9E4,"While not a 'professional' documentary, it was still interesting with good information. Deducted one star for poor grammar and spelling and the intro where the kid, bless his heart, tried to act like, not sure, an FBI agent? I enjoyed the film.",1497052800,,244,4.833333333333333
8661485,4,B00KTOP9E4,"The presentation is not the most professionally produced, but the evidence it presents is very good. Probably the best audio samples of what may be a bigfoot that I have heard to date. Certainly worth the hour it takes to watch it.",1489536000,,231,4.523809523809524
