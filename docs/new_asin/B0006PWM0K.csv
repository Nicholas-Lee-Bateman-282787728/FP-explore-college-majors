8042205,5,B0006PWM0K,"This is a great series of childrens videos.  To date we have all five editions and my children love all of them.  My daughter takes all her favorite stuffed animals and sits down and watches them with full attention.  Other videos do not always hold her interest, but my 2 year old plays along and dances to the music.  She loves the alphabet segment and it really has helped her learn the alphabet.  Definately a series to add to your childs video library",1226880000,,456,4.445783132530121
8042206,5,B0006PWM0K,"My son loves this video and all of the Lots To Learn Videos.  Unlike most vidoes, the Lots to Learn vidoes keep his attention the whole time.  The songs are very catchy.  Best of all, they are educational so I don't feel guilty sitting him in front of the TV because I know he is going to learn.  I highly recommend all of these videos.",1226880000,,336,4.123076923076923
8042207,5,B0006PWM0K,"my toddlers (20 months a boy and 35 months a girl) adore these dvd's. we have nature and my house and they cant watch them enough. my little boy doesnt like any other dvd but he will sit through an entire lots to learn.  i have tried the baby mozart dvd's, the meet the colours and found them brain numbing for both parents and babies.  This is far superior.  very well made and totally entrancing for little ones while teaching them on so many levels.  counting, alphabet, fantastic real life visuals, not just moving objects. i doubt you will be sorry if you try this",1225324800,2,569,4.390476190476191
8042208,5,B0006PWM0K,"We all love this refreshing new video! My kids watch it over and over and they love Buster!  This dvd makes a great gift for anyone that has children of various ages (infant-6 yrs old), because they all get something out of it and it makes learning a fun thing!  Great music, colorful images and beautiful children! Thanks, Lots to Learn, for something new and good to watch!",1164844800,,375,4.5
8042209,5,B0006PWM0K,"Lots To Learn ""In My House"" is terrific! It helps small children understand their surroundings with this interactive exploration of the home. Traveling through the kitchen, living room, and garden, this educational tool uses a friendly cast of kids, real life images, and interactive graphics to endow little viewers with a greater perspective on the things around them. Moreover, little puppet friend Buster the Puppy helps to make learning fun! Increasing counting skills in both English and Spanish, and identifying shapes, colors, and sounds. Also love Lots To Learn ""Nature""!",1139961600,3,580,5.455555555555556
8042210,5,B0006PWM0K,"This dvd features Buster the puppy who appears from time to time.  He's a cute puppy puppet that doesn't speak in this movie.  I was told by Lots To Learn that they are making their next movie and that one will have more of Buster and he'll talk.

In this movie kids show you a room in their house (living room, bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, etc).  A child's voice counts from 1 to 10 leaving time for your child to repeat it after each number.  Then they repeat this.  They do it again in Spanish.  There are some neat colorful things in the video, too, such as spinning plates (the patterns on the dishes are so neat when they spin; like a kaleidoscope).  Also the colored bubbles are neat.  This is a nice video, too, but if I had to choose only one of them I would choose the Nature video first.  But, hopefully you can just get both!",1114473600,6,836,4.234177215189874
8042211,5,B0006PWM0K,"I've got two of the Lots To Learn videos for my kids, age 2 and 5, and they absolutely can't get enough of them. I had reviewed Lots To Learn:Nature a while ago, and now we've watched the second video: Lots To Learn: In My House.

They love singing the songs, touching the screen as questions are asked, exercising along with the other kids on-screen.  As a parent, i love it because it's something I can watch along with them, watching them learn and sharing that time together.  other videos I've had while they were growing up, like the Einstein series, seem overly simple, with spinning toys etc.

These Lots To Learn tapes remind me of Sesame street, and even the older stuff like Capt. Kangaroo. Very interactive with many segments that hold my kids attention.  Alphabet, numbers, exercise, shapes, colors, sounds, games...all in one professional looking DVD.

I highly, highly recommend both Lots To Learn: Nature and Lots To Learn: In My House. You'll love them.

Stay at Home Mom.",1108425600,6,989,4.748538011695906
