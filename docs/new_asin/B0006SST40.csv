2194313,5,B0006SST40,Who knew that they made westerns that were modeled after deep works of literature? This is certainly not your standard white hats versus black hats western. Instead it's almost like Tolstoy as the main character has one minor flaw at teh begining of the film and then slowly becomes a terrible corrupt person because he can't help but keep giving into the bad side of her personality. It's a really deep character study and not at all what you would expect from a typical 40s western. I give it five stars for trying to rise above it's genre.,1153785600,2,542,4.540816326530612
2194314,5,B0006SST40,"When I ordered American Empire I thought that it would be a standard western of good guys and bad guys shooting each other outside the saloon. To say that this film is not that is putting it lightly. Instead, it's a metaphor for man's inhumanity to man. Imagine ""It's A Wonderful Life"" if it had been told from the point of view of the Potter character. I liked seeing a  movie that took the Western motif and tried to make a point with it rather than just giving us another shoot em up. Of coruse there is some shooting eventually, it's just not the entire point of the film the way it is with so many other westerns from this era. It represents a nice, interesting change for the better.",1148342400,,689,4.3
2194315,5,B0006SST40,"""This is a wonderful example of how a man's uncontrolled passions and greed can destroy him completely. Director McGann has handled the narrative beautifully, inspiring his cast to give memorable performances. Although I had never viewed a Preston Foster movie before, I have just added his name to my all-time favorite lists of actors. Thanks a2zcds for preserving this amazing offbeat, yet enthralling Western on DVDs.""",1146528000,2,421,5.393939393939394

8042892,4,B0006SST40,"An illustrated chapter of early cattle history in Texas. Despite the stagey quality of much of the action, the back-and-forth moralizing, and the big villain being (who else? A Frenchman from Louisiana,) there is still much to be enjoyed about this movie. 3 1/2 stars",1474502400,,267,4.955555555555556
8042893,4,B0006SST40,This is a good vintage western with a good cast and story. I would recommend it for fans of westerns from the 40's.,1408752000,,115,4.043478260869565

8042895,1,B0006SST40,"The DVD I received is horribly blurred and unpleasant to watch. It plays without hesitation and the sound is passable, but the picture is the worst I have seen on a DVD.",1368921600,,169,4.3125

8042897,5,B0006SST40,"Don't be fooled by the old B&W version here -- this story is one of the BEST stories about the old west -- and the days of riverboats, etc; After watching this, you can quickly understand the roots of long-loved ""fables"" like Mark Twain's ""Huck Finn""; It was an age of ""first come, first serve"" -- meaning, that the open ranges of the west were still pretty much ""up for grabs"" to anyone willing to weather the ""wild Indians"", the ""cattle-barons"", and all the other things that made life hard back then -- This movie is a MUST GET for anyone who loves old westerns, and history as it was! Wonderful movie -- !!! Don't cheat yourself out of this gem! Promise??? !!!",1362182400,,664,4.40650406504065

This story begins along the Sabine River, between Texas and Louisiana. The owners of a paddlewheel steamboat discuss their business. There is a herd of short-horned cattle being driven to market. The owner will pay for transport. There is a disagreement over payment, the boat owners are paid in stock. They decide on a new business. There is entertainment in town. They buy land for their cattle business, there is a market in the North. Bryce & Taylor expand their lands and claim ownership of all cattle found there. [Do cattle recognize the boundaries?] They will drive their herd to Abilene market and collect for their months of work. But Beauchard has been rustling cattle, they want to catch him in the act. There are shots and a chase for action. Abby gives birth to a son. Years go by, their ranch expands.

But there is a shortage in beef totals, somebody is taking them. Can they close their range? Texas is all open country. The ranchers gather to plan a railroad, they need a right of way. The small ranchers would prefer to ship their cattle instead of driving them overland to Abilene. Young Pat has an accident during this incident. There is a conflict over business direction, and the partnership ends. Sailaway discovers an interesting fact: Beauchard is alive. Bryce captures Beauchard for a trial. Will he escape? Bryce buys barbed wire to enclose his land, the other ranchers decide to act. Will Beauchard take advantage of this opportunity? Will the people be warned in time? Will they believe the messenger? Bryce's men use a barricade to block the road. There is a lot of shooting and an explosion. There is a final agreement among the ranchers for a happy ending.

This historical drama uses the cattle business as a background for personal conflict. Since the railroads didn't arrive in Texas until the 1880s that would date this picture.",1271721600,,1893,4.818461538461539
