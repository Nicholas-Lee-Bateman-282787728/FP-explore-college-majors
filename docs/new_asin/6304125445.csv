Even though I owned the ""Fist of Legend"" (Jet Li) DVD, I also purchased a VHS copy because it was in Cantonese.  What a world of difference in the translation.  It's so much better that I don't mind sacrificing the picture quality.
You just have to know where to find the original language versions on the internet when Amazon doesn't carry them.  ....",1000771200,,463,4.679012345679013
7861984,2,6304125445,"It's too bad that no one sells the cantonese version of this movie because it appears to be a very solid movie that has some excellent even above par fights from Yuen Woo-Ping with the best stuff I have ever seen Yuen Biao do. Unfortunatley the dubbing shoots this one dead and turns it in to a  comedical act,no joke I guarantee that you have never heard a worse dubbed  movie than this one, not even in the Wu-Tang series. The dubbing seems to be  done by a bunch of college students sitting in a basement saying what they  think would be funny at any given moment,and to make it worse they forgot  to remove the subtitles so you know they are making fun of it,for example  in the beggining some chinese guys are counting on an abacus and say  ""so who do you want to bet on the Suns or the Lakers?""Then there  are a couple voices obviously dubbed by a black guy who crack such remarks  in the movie as ""Slow your roll""and""don't move or I'll smoke  everyone in here foo"".And Yuen Biao calls some one ""dude""  and gets drunk and starts singing ""sweet Chariot"",I mean this is  a 1800's period piece ,come on. But like I said the fights ae some excellent  Yuen Woo-Ping stuff and this movie would probably be 5-stars in  cantonese. To end this fiasco someone please call Yuen Woo-Ping and tell him  some punk kids got a hold of his movie...",960854400,,1337,4.334677419354839
