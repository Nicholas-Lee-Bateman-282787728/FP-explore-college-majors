8576387,1,B00C25O714,"I am most unsatisfied with this product. The price charges is  way too expensive for such poor quality. l expect picture issues with bootlegs but these audio problems are absurd to say the least. The price paid for these problems make it basically nothing more than a ""rip-off"". Avoid at all costs...and I am not one to usually make any bad reviews..but this is very bad. Just watch the show on youtube instead...not worth it. The audio is badly out of sync, and missing in places...and the copies are glitchy as well....not worth it..shouldnt be selling this here period.",1399680000,2,572,4.777777777777778
8576388,2,B00C25O714,Several of the episodes were not properly encoded on the disc and thus won't play the audio. I expected better.,1392854400,2,111,4.6
8576389,5,B00C25O714,I received these DVDs in within the expected time. They were also the quality I was hoping to receive. The quality was excellent.,1392076800,5,129,4.6521739130434785
8576390,3,B00C25O714,some of the episodes are missing in the 1st season and some were okay they could have taken out the old ABC tv commercials  I should recieve some discount for not recieving all the episodes or send me the rest of the episodes.,1385424000,5,226,4.255813953488372
8576391,5,B00C25O714,"It took me a while to make up my mind about buying this series as I kept having doubts about the quality of the reproduction, after buying pirated shows from a firm peddling rubbish from China.

The series arrived 12 September and I immediately set to watching the discs. I have just finished and must say I am quite pleased about the reproduction. As stated they are not remastered, so you will have to be contented with the way things used to be, but the best part is for those interested, they are region free.

I am very pleased I purchased the series and the quality of the shows, but they come in twelve indivual cases taped together, so it makes it harder to store them.

It was a pity when Robert Lansing left the show, but that happens for the good or the bad, this time it was for the bad.

Some of the regulars were Frank Overton, John Larkin, Bruce Dern, Paul Burke, Paul Newlan, Lew Gallo, Barney Phillips, Andrew Duggan, Lee Meriwether, Robert Dorman and more. This fine cast had an even finer list of co-stars, who among many were, Peter Fonda, John van Dreelen, Fritz Weaver, Nancy Kovack, Michael Callan, Glen Corbett, Hazel Court, Earl Holliman, Gary Lockwood, James Forrest, Chris Robinson, Andrew Pine, Judy Crane, Claudine Longet, James MacArthur, Edward Mulhare, Kevin McCathy, Roy Thinnes, Marlyn Mason and James Whitmore.

The only three war series I watched were ""Combat"" (Vic Morrow), ""The Rat Patrol"" (Christopher George) and ""12 O'Clock High"" (Robert Lansing). When Paul Burke started giving the orders it was not the same any more, but still very enjoyable.

I was going to deduct one star for this series, but changed my mind and gave it five. My reason is because in this day and age we are lucky to get some of the old great shows of the past, and we should be thankful for what we get, and the dedication Classic Video LLC has put in finding what they could of the series for the public deserves full marks.

Anyone interested in war shows should not be disappointed with this set, but if you are not used to quality of shows of the past, then this may not appeal to you, but give it a chance, you may enjoy the way television shows were before all the over-the-top graphics were even thought of.",1379203200,14,2229,4.543640897755611
8576392,5,B00C25O714,"Excellent set of dvd's.  This set did not have all of Robert Lansing's seasons.  The rest of 12 O'clock High with Burk 's
take over role for Robert Lansing as General Savage were interesting to watch.  Burk's acting did not measure up to Lansings abilities.  The scenes and stories were very interesting.  Good writers and good filming aspects .",1375315200,10,345,4.779661016949152
8576393,5,B00C25O714,It was well done. I'm a fan of the series. There were only a couple of episodes I would have liked to have been included.,1373241600,9,121,3.88
8576394,1,B00C25O714,"There is NO sound on 4 out of the 8 episodes I have tried to watch so far!  I am on the verge of giving up.  This is so disappointing that I cannot recommend it to anyone at this time, given this completely unacceptable situation.  I realize this product was taken from un-remastered footage, but if it was going to include entire episodes with no sound, that fact should have been disclosed by the seller.  This is by far the worst quality experience I have ever encountered on Amazon, and anything you can do to prevent others from being so cheated would be doing future customers a great service.  Thank you.",1368057600,29,611,4.468468468468468
