She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurable powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

In this volume we learn the identity of the man who created all the chaos 50 years ago. Consumed by his lust for Kikyo, Naraku set all the evil loose onto the world. He confrosts our heroes and nearly kills them all.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353196800,,1362,4.31640625

7987763,5,B00008XRZ3,"As our heroes battle for their lives against Sesshomaru, who can now utilize Tetsusaiga, and Naraku, the demon who tricked Inuyasha and Kikyo into killing each other, Inuyasha begins to believe that Kagome is in too much danger in his world. After the battle he takes the Sacred Jewel shards from her, pushes her into the well, and seals it with an entire tree! After returning to Kaede's village, Inuyasha looks for the true identity of who Naraku is. Kaede tells him about a burned and paralyzed man that Kikyo cared for long ago named Onigumo who just might be the suspect they're looking for. But will Inuyasha be able to defeat him without Kagome?

Excellent battle scenes and depths of storytelling seldom seen in other anime. Also, the demon designs, drawn from traditional Japanese art, are interesting. There's a little more emotion going on between Inuyasha and Kagome in this volume, especially when he draws her to him in an embrace because he feared for her life. But as always, he can play it off by saying he just wanted to get close to her to steal the jewel shards, but we all know the truth. It's little nuances like this that make this show special.",1122768000,,1168,4.642512077294686
7987764,5,B00008XRZ3,"this vol. is like the best of all 6 vols., in this vol it shows inuyasha battling sesshoumaru, and how inuyasha loves kagome and cares for what happens to her. It also shows how  inuyasha starts to find out the truth about Naraku and how he was onigumo, the simple human who became an unbeatable demon , it really is a sad story cause inuyasha throws kagome back in the well and takes the jewel so she can't come back, but she does come back thanks to shippo,what would happen if her weren't around. I recommend for inuyasha fans to watch it, there are some sad parts and a funny part in there, but you have to own it.",1058918400,10,618,4.19327731092437
