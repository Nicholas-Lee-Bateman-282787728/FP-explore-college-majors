8678749,1,B00NJYGUEO,"Mr Goodwin's presentation is very poorly done - both content and technically. Advertising promises are creating expectations which are far from being met. He repeats himself endlessly, has a very poor rhetoric and a boring, many times unclear, way of speaking. If he would abide by basic rules of public speaking, he could condense his message into ONE Dvd rather then trying to sell  six of them. Technically, the product is a desaster: volume too low, poor sound quality, one camera fixed on Mr Goodwin fulltime and not one single visual insert - in short, one feels cheated having bought this product.",1419811200,6,604,4.921568627450981
