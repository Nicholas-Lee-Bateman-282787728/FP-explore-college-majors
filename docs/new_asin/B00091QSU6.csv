8056447,5,B00091QSU6,Very interesting. Our church library had the videos so we decided to update to the dvd's. The script is almost the same as the video's so we decided to keep the video leaders guide and workbooks.,1456099200,,195,4.444444444444445

8056449,3,B00091QSU6,"First, I think this is a great idea; a quick overview of Christian History.  The DVD works fine and is professionally done. Doctor George speaks clearly and slowly, though his accent has him pronunce some names a tad differently than most. Overall, this is a fantastic dvd.... However, after only watching the first two sections out of six I have already found some glaring mistakes.  One example: in the second section regarding the Middle Ages, the DVD correctly shows, in the form of a written timeline, the date for the Battle of Poitiers as having taken place in 732. Unfortunately, during the oral presentation, the narrator, not the host, states that the battle took place in 1732.  If the viewer was new to Christian history and did not read the chart at the beginning, then they may mistakenly think that the battle took place a thousand years later. Of course anyone who is a history buff, be it of Christian or Medieval history, would know that no such battle between the West and Islam took place at that time and would see the mistake right away.",1275609600,11,1059,4.682795698924731

Timothy George, a Protestant believer and Ph. D. in Church History (from Harvard University) does an excellent job at presenting Church History in a concise yet meaningful manner.  The presentation is broken up into six period, each of 30 minutes.  Because of the rich and detailed history of the ""one holy catholic and apostolic Church,"" Dr. George can only do an overview of each period and cover at least one person as a highlight representative of each.  The DVD includes a PDF guide for students and one for instructor, in case this DVD will be used in a Christian school curriculum or church classroom setting.

Section I: The Early Church

Section II: The Church in the Middle Ages

Section III: The Reformation

Section IV: The Age of Reason and Piety

Section V: Christianity in the New World

Section VI: Christian Movement in an Age of Uncertainty

In CONCLUSION, since so many Protestants and Catholics (and some Orthodox) American believers are so clueless as to how and when our New Testament was compiled (and formed into a canon), how the Church has always existed as ""one holy catholic [universal] and apostolic Church"", how politics, economics, sciences and arts have been influenced by Christian thought and doctrine, and how we ended up to be so diverse this DVD is a unique source in the marketplace.  Besides the format improvements, a wider subject-breath, and more info on the history of the Orthodox Church, this is an excellent source for both student and teacher, Christian and non-Christian, viewer and reader.

THANK YOU for your VOTES (up or down)!",1168819200,21,1639,4.930656934306569
8056451,5,B00091QSU6,"This series flies through the centuries hitting highlights of great events and personages in church history.  Although it is probably slanted more toward evangelicals than other groups, it seeks to accomodate other branches of Christianity and treats all groups with respect.

Most Christians are completely clueless when it comes to church history.  Although this is a greatly simplfied survey (covering 2,000 years in 3 hours), the average layman can understand and enjoy such a presentation without it seeming long or boring.

We used the series on Sunday nights, and I would sub-divide each 30 minute subject into two and, after 15 minutes of viewing, I would use the workbook material for another 15 to 25 minutes of discussion and additional information. I believe that the workbook material/teacher's guide now comes as a PDF file (I had the older video tape version).

This series could be expanded greatly if the leader has some background in church history and students were eager to learn, or it could be viewed straight through without comment (or you could use my more modest approach).  Either way, I highly recommend it for individuals, home study groups, Sunday School classes, or evening service presentations.",1140566400,30,1227,5.2030456852791875
