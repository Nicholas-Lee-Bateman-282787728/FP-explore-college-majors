8496056,2,B003XP2Z20,"From the DVD cover: ""Visual highlights and interviews""

From the DVD booklet: ""10 films by Peider A. Defilla covering the most important concerts of the festival. Interviews with the composers, conductors and performers, as well as numerous music excerpts""

Note that it says ""visual highlights"" and ""music excerpts"". You will NOT be getting any complete, uninterrupted performances on this DVD. Each of the 10 pieces is repeatedly interrupted with cuts to interview snippets. Why on Earth did they think people would want to see the performances butchered like this?

I regret this purchase. Two stars only because the source material is highly interesting, if you can sit through the interruptions.",1460505600,,700,5.345454545454546
