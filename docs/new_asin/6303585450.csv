7852040,5,6303585450,This is brilliantly funny.  It shows how poorly informed many of our legislators truly are. And how pompous most of them and our executive people are.  This should be made into DVD format.,1375660800,,188,4.666666666666667
7852041,5,6303585450,"Presented as TV coverage of a Congressional hearing, Mastergate describes an elaborate parody of Iran-Contra, in which illegal arms shipments are made using a big budget Hollywood action film as cover.  The inspiration for this satire is the Iran Contra and Watergate hearings but the lesson to be learned is that this could be any serious governmental misstep of recent years.  The hypocrites of one party attacking the hypocrites of the opposition, instead of focusing on the real issues.  Using the temporary emergency to settle old political scores, etc.  Most of the actors in this film are TV character actors from at least 30 years ago, so it's appeal may be lost on new viewers, but the real star of the film is the brilliant use of language--the politicians on both sides of the gavel speak as much as they can while saying as little as possible.  There's enough doublespeak to put George Orwell to shame, all delivered by a top-notch cast.  You will enjoy this film if you pay attention, and believe me you will, wondering what they will say next and what does it mean!",1359849600,2,1079,4.74331550802139
7852042,4,6303585450,I had first seen this film on HBO and I enjoyed it right away.  I also thought that it was quite an ingenious idea for a movie.  The idea to turn a Congressional Hearing for a scandal involving the President of the United States and members of his Cabinet into a political satire was very amusing.  I personally enjoyed the subject of this film.  It had both humorous and dramatic moments that were really exciting.  This film was well-written and presented.  It also had a great cast which gave convincing and effective performances.  I really liked this film and I think that it's worth watching.,980121600,3,598,4.6380952380952385
7852043,5,6303585450,This is the BEST video spoof that I have ever seen!  After about 10min. you begin to think this is REAL coverage.  I watched it back in 1993 and just loved it! -,961286400,3,161,3.8484848484848486
7852044,5,6303585450,"I, PERSONALLY AND MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY THOUGHT THIS TO BE THE MOST INFORMATIVE, AND POSSIBLY THE MOST ACCURATE OF ALL MOVIES MADE ON POLITICS IN WASHINGTON, D.C.  THE INS AND OUTS OF POLITICAL DEALING HAS  NEVER BEEN SHOWN IN SUCH  GRAPHIC DETAIL.  COMBINE THIS WITH THE  ""PERFECT"" SELECTION OF GREAT ACTORS, AND YOU HAVE A WINNER AND  POSSIBLY ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES OF IT'S TYPE EVER MADE.  I THINK IT  SHOULD BE ""REQUIRED VIEWING"" BY ALL HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE  STUDENTS
TO BETTER INTRODUCE THEM TO ""REAL LIFE""
