8142631,5,B000I00PE8,I love Johnny Depp and these shows takes me back to my childhood :),1416009600,,67,3.857142857142857
8142632,4,B000I00PE8,"Well I cannot believe I paid so much for this- don't really like the packaging and I read reviews that if I purchase this, I'm missing an important J Depp episode. I have enjoyed re-watching the episodes though. I wish the price were better. It's not worth the price...but I'm still enjoying watching",1389052800,,300,4.679245283018868
8142633,5,B000I00PE8,"I only have the first three seasons of this series but it is still good.  I have run into many series that i remember liking back when and them turning out not as i remembered as not wanting to watch more then a few episodes, but this series is still great.  I need to get the last seasons.",1345593600,,290,3.9827586206896552

8142635,5,B000I00PE8,"The cast of this show worked really well together, and the bond of friendship that they developed was strong. The reality that the series projected really touched me. When members of the cast were lost, they were replaced with strong actors that filled the void quickly. Shows that different personalities are a must to make something work.",1275696000,2,340,4.982456140350878
8142636,5,B000I00PE8,"i still did not watch it as yet, but it is very good show, if you like Miami vice or the Wire or shows like that you will like this",1260057600,,131,3.4
8142637,5,B000I00PE8,"This is a great show. Mostly I love it because the 80's were an awesome decade and because Johnny Depp was so hot. So were Dustin Nguyen and Peter DeLuise, but mostly Johnny.
The DVDs were in brand new condition and arrived promptly. They were well worth the price.",1228780800,,265,4.428571428571429
8142638,5,B000I00PE8,I bought this for my husband as he was a big fan when it was on tv. I really enjoyed watching it myself.,1220745600,,104,3.5652173913043477
8142639,4,B000I00PE8,"Personally, I feel producers had nothing to say sometimes and they create sort of phantasies aka ""Space Odyssey-2001"" speculating on future of the characters.

Cast is good, Depp is out of any comment, and Dustin Nguyen's hero is very nice lad in this mob-the best to my opinion.",1209427200,,279,4.8125
