8396629,4,B003GXEA2C,"The videos offer great material with practical exercises to connect with the faery realm, and Orion is a wonderful teacher who brings real magical tradition to the modern world. I would give this video set five stars, except for the unprofessional audio/video quality. Having been filmed in Hollywood, you would think they could have found a good videographer! For most of the workshop, participants did not have microphones, so I couldn't understand their questions and comments. Though on one of the disks I could hear the participants, but then it was hard to understand Orion. Occasionally there are long moments where the camera seems to be held by a three-year-old, swirling around aimlessly. Other times it remains focused on something unrelated to what Orion is talking about, as if it was just set and left to run on its own.

That being said, I found the content compelling and fascinating. I think it is an excellent introduction to faery lore and it provides a good basis for exploring the world of faery for those who cannot study with Orion Foxwood in person. All in all I would highly recommend it, but don't expect Hollywood film quality.",1278720000,4,1154,4.887755102040816

I highly recommend this DVD collection for anyone who is interested in the Faery realm and working with them.  Orion's is an amazing teacher, who brings this path to clear understanding with a down to earth approach.  You will want to own this DVD collection, because you'll want to take notes and review is always good!  :)  This is one of the DVDs I have in my permanent, must have Craft resources library.

This is from a 2 day intensive with Orion Foxwood, these intesives are, well intense.  I am working through the Seership apprentice program and this DVD is great to have on hand.

Blessings,
Mary",1271980800,,619,4.614678899082569
