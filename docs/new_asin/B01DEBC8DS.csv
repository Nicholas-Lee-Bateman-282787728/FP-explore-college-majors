7711897,1,B01DEBC8DS,The Movie is great and fills all the plot holes but the Superman statue is ridiculous. The problem is the skin tone is completely washed out or basically to white. Its close to T-shirt white. I would recommend people go with the Batman one instead. I'm still debating what to do with mine. I've been a fan of Superman ever since I was a kid but DC really screwed up this statue with the skin color. The rest of it looks good. So buyer beware!,1472428800,,442,4.211764705882353

The only issue was that for an item that was pre-ordered it was sad to receive the item two weeks after it was available for general purchase.

Still, great movie, did not deserve the criticism that it received.",1470614400,,369,4.6923076923076925

7711919,5,B01DEBC8DS,"Hi Amazon readers,
I just purchased this product and received it yesterday. First of all before I start writing my thoughts about this product, there are 2 parts I like to write about.
1. The movie - Although this is an Ultimate Edition which contains 30 mins of extra footage, plus the mystery Jena Malone role we been waiting to see. I seriously don't find anything special or feels that I've missed a great deal while watching the theater edition. So don't expect a great deal of 30 mins extra. I've expected some extra action scene or they show the part whereby how Batman get his hand on the kyptonite but I was kinda disappointed...
2. The Status - This is the reason why I'm writing this and why you are reading this.
I love the statue... It is a solid, heavy, nice great statue. I got the Batman statue and although I got friends telling me the detail of the face is not very fine. Well first of all this isn't sideshow or premium statue. Yes I do agree the face detail is slightly out. But overall the statue is still a nice great solid statue to add to your collection. Apart from the face, the body, Batsuit, is really really great. It is does gives a premium look or rather should I say the overall quality is excellent and won't lost out to other ""premium statue"" or figures.

So if you were to ask me is this worth buying???
Definitely YES for the statue! But I won't say the same for the 30 mins extra footage of the film... I somehow feel disappointed by the ""ultimate"" edition...",1470096000,,1496,4.362007168458781
7711920,5,B01DEBC8DS,I am very happy with my package. Showed up the day the app said it would. Well packed and the statue is awesome. I love it!,1470009600,2,123,3.769230769230769
7711921,5,B01DEBC8DS,"For die hard fans of Batman, or Superman,........this movie is amazing in every way. This is more of a review for the Batman statue that came as an Amazon limited edition,.......it's worth putting down the extra 70 to 80 dollars in my opinion. Great detail. The pack was great!! not only that, but it comes with a mini poster/blow up of the artwork of the back side of your Blu-ray/dvd case. This would look great behind your statue in a display case,.......",1469923200,2,458,4.597560975609756

7711923,4,B01DEBC8DS,"The statue came well packed I love the size as it is bigger than the dc collectible. The paint is well done on the suit and belt, a lot of nice little detailing was done. I also like how the cape is part of the mold, however I was surprised that the suit, belt, gauntlets and boots where do detailed but the face.....  MY GOD the face It looks like my 5 year old painted the face on for them, that was disappointing so I have to mark it down a star. why so much detail on everything but the face? I guess because they feel batman is a butterface? ... The movie comes with 1 standard dvd theater disc I assume this is to throw at your wife or dog while because they are talking and/or barking while you are busy watching the extended cut blu Ray disc. Also the digital downloads provides you access to both the theatrical and extended cut once again I assume this is because no one cares about the theater cut so and wanted to see if you would notice they gave you two copy's or piss you off and laugh when you accidentally watch the wrong one .. The ultimate edition is awesome with extra footage and batmans Fight scenes had more blood, which confirmed he so smashed  a dudes head with that create he flings across the room because in ultimate edition you get the blood splatter, so no denying it now batman had zero f's given",1469491200,2,1327,4.2

7711934,1,B01DEBC8DS,The statue is so poorly done!  You can see the areas where it has been painted and it looks horrible!  I wish I would have just bought The movie And spent a 100 bucks on another statute by a better manufacturers!  Horrible do not buy!,1469059200,2,234,4.155555555555556
7711935,5,B01DEBC8DS,"So Ultimate edition of this movie is better, still not has some story problems but it flows a whole lot better then the theatrical release. I give it a B- which is a whole lot better than the what it was originally. I haven't watched the special features but I am sure they are good. The main attraction for this product is the statue it comes with it. I got the Batman statue, it is a two piece (batman connects to the rock). When its put together simply, it is a solid piece. Its not Hot Toys detailed but I find it to be well detailed for what you get compared to others. Wish I could afford the superman on cause they are awesome. I recommend the buy!",1469059200,,655,4.125

7711944,5,B01DEBC8DS,"This is a review of the collector's edition and not the movie itself, to start the statue is really good quality for what you are paying for, is around 12"" tall , and has great detail, easy you would normally pay more than a $100 bucks for one like this, if you think about it you're actually paying around $90 dolares discounting the price of the blu-ray ( $25) , so to sum up, a great deal if you like to collect this kind of stuff.",1468886400,2,434,4.058139534883721
7711945,5,B01DEBC8DS,I know the price is a little too high and you're gonna think it's not worth it but believe me it is. The movie is amazing way better than the theater one because a lot of the extra scenes now make sense!!! I'm always a big DC fan and I absolutely love this movie. And also the figure is not small I thought it was gonna be but it's actually big. I display it proudly with my funko pop  If you are a DC fan this is a must have,1468886400,27,425,3.7222222222222223
7711946,5,B01DEBC8DS,"First, I understand that the title of the movie is ""Batman vs. Superman""...but to not even MENTION Gal Gadot in the description of the movie, NOR the credits?  How much more of a slap in the face can you give the woman?  And I'm not sure about anyone else that saw the movie, but the only time that the theater I was in started clapping and standing on their feet, was when Gal appeared on screen in full Wonder Woman glory.  Not Ben as Batman, not Henry as Superman - but WONDER WOMAN.

And yes, I *loved* the entire movie, but why is it that credit can't be given where it's rightfully due?  Did she not save both of them from Doomsday?  Or was I watching an entirely different movie...",1468022400,,688,4.253846153846154
7711947,5,B01DEBC8DS,good movie,1467763200,,10,4.5
7711948,5,B01DEBC8DS,"I wasn't into the gimmicky BVS idea at first, but halfway through I found myself enjoying this film, kind of a mystery with storylines and emotions.  Z.Snyders artistic style and choreographed fights are pure eye candy, is he Ron Howard when it comes to telling stories, no, but he has enough going for him here to get my credit. It's a superhero flick, it's not like he butchered Braveheart or something. Not everything is going to be fleshed out in these types of movies, there's too many roads to take. It has darker tones which is what I dig and the Batman angle worked well. Nice to see Superman showing his fears too. And the critics who griped about too much noisy action seem to love it in any Marvel movie. Hulk can tear up a building and it's a splendid time at the cinema, Batman does it and it's for moronic teeny boppers with zits. Go figure. BVS flies by and it's a fun ride. Solid final shot with emotional impact.",1467158400,2,929,4.401162790697675
7711949,5,B01DEBC8DS,"I admit, I was not looking forward to this film when I first heard about it.  It had Alien Vs Predator written al over it.  To me, it felt like the people at DC wanted to rush and play catch up.  Boy was I wrong!  Although this movie may be about 20 minutes too long, I love the fact that Zack Snyder was able to pull off not only a great story between batman.and superman, but he also discreetly interjected Flash, Cyborg, aquaman, and most importantly Wonder Woman. All the actors are to notch here, especially Ben Afleck as Bruce Wayne/batman. He embraces the role and takes it seriously. I absolutely love this film, and it gets my highest reccomendation. As mentioned in other reviews here, Wonder Woman pretty much comes out of nowhere and assists bats and sup in the final act.  There's a wonderful moment when superman looks over at batman and asks ""is she with you?"" And batman answers ""no, I thought she was with you.  Christopher Nolan is involved so you get a bit more of a tinge of reality and it feels like a James Bond film more than a comic book movie!  A lot of the source material came from the graphic novel Batman: the dark night returns!  DC hit this one out of the park!  Not bashing marvel movies at all... I love them... But seeing my favorite character having to join a team and play as a team member adds a whole new dynamic to the Batman franchise!",1466985600,,1375,4.33984375
7711950,5,B01DEBC8DS,"Loved this movie. Was geeking out every time I watched it, which was a grand total of 3; kinda wish it was more. That's how much I loved it. Ben Affleck is the best Batman to date. His combat techniques as well as his Bat suits are ripped directly from the comics, and it's awesome to see him in action. Henry Cavill continues to thrive as Supes, striving to be the savior the world wants and needs. Jesse as Lex comes along and decides to get rid of Supes, manipulating Supes and Bats to war. Jesse's Lex, while some may call it too over the top, was fantastically dark and sets his version apart from Gene Hackman's version from the Christopher Reeve days. However, regardless of what I say, watch it for yourself and form your own opinion.",1465948800,,742,4.384057971014493
7711951,2,B01DEBC8DS,"The stars this has are not accurate to the quality of the film. Who do you think is more likely to recommend this on Amazon? People who loved it and saw it several times, or people who were disappointed and forgot it existed?

Instead of looking at review scores like most buffoons, read what critics actually say. That is the key to getting an idea of what a film is like.

As for the film itself: A deeply flawed and sometimes comically (ha!) bad film that was clearly made with a lot of effort and care, but falls short of nearly every goal it set for itself.

The cast is hit and miss, with Ben Affleck being the best fit by far.

Henry Cavill is basically a handsome robot when he would be much better served reusing his performance from 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E'

Gal Gadot (I think that's her name but forgive me if I'm wrong) fits her role like a glove in what little time she has on screen.

Jesse Eisenberg is just a mess in his scenes. He most likely just did what he was told, which is reprise his Mark Zuckerberg, but this time on lot's of drugs.

The cinematography is absurdly good most of the time but gets messy during action scenes. There are some lovely shots and this is Zack Snyder's greatest (only?) strength.

The pacing and script are an absolute catastrophe. So much is going on at once that the film buckles under it's workload, leaving you bored until someone does something cool (which does happen, thankfully).

Plot threads are being set-up while other films are being hinted at and fan-pleasing easter eggs are shown and heard. All this is going on while the film's main plot is trying and failing to happen without boring the audience.

Batman is angry at Superman for stupid reasons and Superman is kind of just doing nothing the whole time but hanging out with/saving Lois Lane. They meet and eventually fight each other once the movie remembers it's name.

The characters don't have arcs and motivations so much as loose excuses to brood/fight/ramble/be rescued.

The battles in this film are flashy and brutal spectacles that are cool but short-lived compared to the much less stimulating 'Let's talk about basically nothing over and over again' that makes up the other 75% of the runtime.

Everything that follows the titular character's showdown is quite embarrassing to watch, even as a DC fan. I'll leave it at that.

The idea that this is the poster for the new DCEU is a sad one that leaves me hopelessly disappointed.

I'd say skip this unless the very idea of Batman and/or Superman punching each other in a film makes you lose your mind with excitement. Wait, that happened to me and I hate it.

Just skip it.",1465862400,4,2653,4.553684210526316
7711952,3,B01DEBC8DS,Anyone that gives this movie 5 stars has something wrong with their brain. This is like a 2.6 star movie but had to bump it up to 3. There are so many things that are non sensical and betray the long establish characterization of both batman and superman but I could not bring myself to hate this movie. I doubt a 6 hour cut of this movie would really improve it unless a lot of what was in the theatrical version was cut out.,1464912000,6,426,4.083333333333333

So many plot holes, bad writing and dream crap that its hard to totally enjoy this movie especially if you have been reading DC Comics for years and years and I don't mean the lame New52 comics either. The effects (except Doomsday) and the outfits were incredible, the actual characters and great DC story lines all squashed together was just lazy story telling.

I'm a hardcore DC fan and this DCEU is not the DC Universe that should be on the big screen, its more like a Frank Miller Universe with other stuff all thrown in. I'm sad to say Civil War was so much better, 10x if not more a better movie than BVS and that hurts me to say that.

The best parts of the movie are the Batman and Wonder Woman scenes. I personally hated and was very annoyed with the use of Lois Lane and Superman. The story implies Batman has been around for 20 years but Metropolis and the world apparently were kept in the dark about him since they react like someone taking action is something new. The story should have just been called Dawn of Justice and had no Batman in the title. Doomsday looked horrible. Aquaman apparently has nothing better to do with his time. Ben Affleck needs a standalone Batman movie with no Superman. Movie was too long and had too many one liners that they tried to turn into two lines. The story was slow and should have been two different movies. If it wasn't for the inclusion of Superman stories it would have been the best Batman since Keaton.,1462579200,,946,4.505813953488372

7711966,5,B01DEBC8DS,"Stunning film and I'm completely saddened by the negativity this film has received on social media mostly, but the hatred could not keep me from enjoying this film immensely. Full disclosure: I am a DC fan, through and through. So I went into this film with huge expectations. And for the most part, WB succeeded on every level. The film opens with a strong callback to Man of Steel. And from the opening minutes my heart was racing.

Shortly came two scenes that were completely unexpected and perhaps the most enjoyable of the film, and I never even saw it coming: I'm referring to the ""Knightmare"" scene followed immediately by the Flash cameo. One scene fed the other. And this scene was so incredible that I couldn't stop thinking about it during the movie, after the movie was over, and well into the next day and I anxiously awaited for this scene when I watched the film again two days later. It's difficult for me to describe here my personal infatuation with these two scenes, but it was these scenes that made me believe that Zack Snyder had done his job and had done it well. He understood the JL and the DC Universe and presented it perfectly to us as the opening salvo in a very in-Marvel way of making comic book films. And I love it!

Also, this is the most fascinating and fun and awesome and generally badass Batman we have ever seen on film before. The fighting should win awards. The costumes should win awards. And Ben Affleck's Bruce Wayne/Batman should win as well. It was a stunning role from Ben, and I do not want to wait until 2018 for his solo Bat film. But now I have faith that it will rock the world... I enjoyed this film at 2 1/2 hours and it could have went to 3 to smooth out some of the plot a bit, but that's where this DVD comes in...

7711975,5,B01DEBC8DS,"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge Batman fan and always have been. I'd heard many complaints from the beginning about how Ben Affleck would be horrible, how they treat Superman too dark, how DC movies can't live up to Marvel's movies.  I don't understand why they should. This was a fabulous movie. Zach Snyder did a wonderful job bring these characters to life. Ben Affleck was superb. His Batman was spot on, as the brooding , angry crime fighter he should be. His Bruce Wayne was just as good, suave , charming and dedicated to his family name.  Henry Cavill's Superman is also great. For me personally, I don't think any actor could match the late great Christopher Reeve as the Man of Steel, but Cavill's Last Son of Krypton is perfect for this movie. Gal Gadot brings it all together. She was equally as wonderful as her male co-stars. Can't wait for her solo movie. Stunning and beautiful as Diana Prince and yet very capable and believable as the Warrior Princess. I was reminded of how Diana Rigg brought to life a heroine in Emma Peel who was both very sexy and feminine and yet could kick some serious butt. I'm still on the fence about Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. I think he may be a little too young, but he does a great job at bringing a psychotic tech genius to life. The action is great, the fight scenes are great, everything moves along at a crisp pace. I'm very thankful that Snyder didn't take the time to bog down the film with back stories. This is a movie made for comic fans. If you don't know who these characters are by now, why are you going to this movie?

7711979,5,B01DEBC8DS,"There are a lot of negative reviews out there of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. And I almost believed them. Until I went and saw the movie for myself. I loved it. The biggest problem I saw was the pacing. There were times where some scenes would come and go before you had time to process what was going on. Which only lasts the first part of the movie. Once things really hit the fan, things are paced pretty nicely.

Let me start by saying Ben Affleck surprised me as Batman. I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt but I was still worried he'd be terrible. But I can safely say he did a good job as Batman. As of right now he's my second favorite live-action Batman. I'll have to see more of him in his solo movie before I can say if he's as good or better
than Christian Bale.

Superman was one of my issues with the first half of the movie. He seemed to be glossed over a lot. Where his scenes would zip by. Like a rescue of a girl trapped in a burning building. Instead of getting to see him save her, we see as he's returning her to her family. I would have liked to see him in action more than what he was in the earlier parts
of the film.

Wonder Woman has a fairly small role. But people clapped when she first entered the final battle of the movie. I didn't join in, but finally seeing Wonder Woman on the big screen was epic enough to warrant it.

There is a conspiracy against Superman where he is framed to appear like he killed some terrorists that led to corrupt governments having villagers killed in retaliation. We see why Batman wants to beat Superman's brains in, which was evident in the trailers.

The fight between Batman and Superman was epic. Batman utilized Kryptonite to give him a fighting chance. Kryptonite came into play after some was recovered from the World Engine from Man of Steel that crashed in the Indian Ocean after Superman destroyed it. Lex got his hands on it, and Batman stole it from him so he could use it in his fight against Superman. No spoilers about who won the fight.

We all saw Doomsday in the trailer. And all I'll say here is that the fight is pretty awesome. Wonder Woman and Superman slug it out with Doomsday and Batman spawn camps him with a Kryptonite smoke grenade. It was nice to see a group of heroes fight a bad guy without it being nameless henchman or drone copies of the villain or it didn't involve a dance-off like in certain Marvel movies. And the bad guy wasn't defeated in a ""Comedy"" segment like Loki in the first Avengers movie.

I don't want to give too much away. But all of the negative reviews are unwarranted. It seems like if something doesn't have Marvel Studios in the title it is already under extreme scrutiny. Since the movie has a dark tone and isn't full of knock-knock jokes and fart jokes like the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies (an exaggeration, but those movies do get carried away with the jokes), people seem to have a negative opinion. People had already written off the movie because of Affleck's casting, which isn't fair considering people gave wooden acting Chris Evans a chance as Captain America (which he gives a wooden performance there).

I have seen people whine about the plot holes. And there are a couple. How does Lex find out Clark is Superman? How did Clark find out Bruce was Batman? How did Lois know to get the Kryptonite spear? But I can look past those because they weren't as massive a plot hole as the end of Thor: The Dark World where Thor couldn't see through Loki's disguise after seeing through his illusions earlier in the same movie.

Frankly, this movie had the guts to do what Marvel doesn't. There is a death in this movie that shocked me. Don't want to give too much away, but people aren't going to be happy because he didn't have baseball cards on him and he didn't pop up peachy-keen in the next scene like every character killed in the Marvel Cinematic Universe movie except for Quicksilver in Age of Ultron (which they originally planned to reveal in the New Avengers scene at the end that he somehow made it out alive without explanation).

As I said, my biggest issue with the movie was the pacing. There were rumors late 2014 and early 2015 that Batman v. Superman was going to be broken up into two movies. And I wish they had done that. Then the pacing wouldn't have been an issue. There were parts of this movie where it felt like two movies being played out in one movie. But what can you do? Seems they only break movies into two parters when it's a young adult novel series.

Give this movie a chance. Frankly, I don't trust professional critics anymore. Seeing as how they act like every Marvel Cinematic Universe movie is solid gold when most of them have 1 dimensional villains and always have to rely on a MaGuffin to move the plot along. And none of the critics slammed Thor: The Dark World for the Grand Canyon Sized plot hole at the end. People go into those movies with an automatic positive view just because critics give them all stellar reviews, even when they are complete garbage like Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. And people seem to only want to go into DC movies with a negative outlook these days. All I can say is watch the movie for yourself. The pacing is a little quick, but the action is great, Ben Affleck actually did a good job, and the movie has a shocking moment that I know I'll be talking about for a long time at the end.

And not to bash people who liked it, but how can critics slam this movie while praising Star Wars Ep. VII which most of that was a rehash of A New Hope? And those same critics will no doubt sing the praise of that new Ghostbusters movie that everyone is throwing up about.

I'm curious to see the extended edition. My guess is they didn't want to hear people whining about a really long movie so they cut the crap out of it to trim the run time down. People seem to want to only sit through a 3 hour movie if it's got Hobbit's walking toward a volcano or if it's a biopic that people only love because the Academy tells them to.

And people taking Rotten Tomatoes rating as gospel? Let's look at the facts. Avatar has a rating of over 80%. And everyone knows the only good thing about that movie was the special effects. So who would believe Rotten Tomatoes?",1460246400,10,6274,4.3467122117848

7711983,4,B01DEBC8DS,"Great movie overall. I really don't understand why the critics panned it like that. Now who would have thought that Ben Affleck could have pulled off such a visceral Batman? Excellent performance on this part. Of course I had some issues with it, but no movie is perfect. Cavill's Superman comes across as kind of detached and separate from humanity in this movie, which I don't mind and actually is plausible, whether this was a deliberate effort or not. He seems to act out of an obligatory sense of doing right, as opposed to caring about humanity (a la Chris Reeve). If he loses his anchor (Lois), I'm not sure this Superman will care much about the rest of us, and I definitely see him killing people if her death was deliberate.

And Ben Affleck's Batman, while completely a physical powerhouse and a smooth (though somewhat slightly lacking/ underdeveloped  Bruce Wayne) did not come off the intelligent detective of the comics. I half expected/ hoped he would have discovered Superman's secret identity almost as easily as Lois did. However, I don't consider this to be Ben Affleck's fault, but one of the writer's.

7711987,4,B01DEBC8DS,"Unless you've been in a coma for the past week or so, it's kind of hard to miss the massive amounts of reviews slamming DC Comics' latest cinematic entry, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" It's not the worst comic book adaptation ever -- ""Spider-Man 3,"" ""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" ""Hulk,"" ""Green Lantern,"" ""Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,"" the Joel Schumacher-directed Batman films (""Batman Forever"" and ""Batman & Robin""), ""Ghost Rider,"" ""Jonah Hex,"" and all of the Fantastic Four films fit up on that mantle -- nevertheless, I think the negative reviews are a bit extreme and critics are definitely over-exaggerating. Now, don't get me wrong. Critics and viewers have the right to not like this film. Batman v Superman (BvS) is not one of the greatest comic book films ever -- it's not as good as ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" nor does it even come close to the best comic book adaptation to date: ""The Dark Knight."" However, BvS is not the dull let-down the naysayers would have you believe it is.

First off, let me say I enjoyed BvS! Despite its title, I'm happy it was more than some rock-'em-sock-'em action flick. Besides the much-talked-about action near the end, there was an actual story (which is more than I can say for Peter Jackson's ""The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies"") -- this time around inevitably having Superman dealing with the aftermath/fallout of his battle royale with General Zod (Michael Shannon), Ursa, and the rest of their Kryptonian criminal crew at the end of ""Man of Steel."" I particularly liked the fact that this film addressed the almost vilifying of Superman, which perfectly reminds audiences of why Superman -- despite his few allies -- is one of the most alienated comic book characters. Despite his attempts to do good ever since the Kryptonian attack in Man of Steel (MoS), there is always some group of people he's offending or accused of attacking. This comes to a head when he is framed for murdering a group of African villagers and criminal soldiers (although, there is no shown casualities other than the criminals), and his actions get the attention of Senator Finch (Holly Hunter), who heads a Congressional subcommittee investigating Superman and believes he should understandably be held accountable for his actions or, in this case, inadvertent actions. While this is going on, spoiled rich boy (who tries not to act spoiled) Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) exploits the public's fear of Superman by using some Kryptonite found in the Indian Ocean to create a ""final solution"" to end Superman. As for his actual motivation, Luthor simply envies what he cannot have: Superman's power. It's the same motivation every Superman fan and anyone who's read a Superman comic knows. While this is all happening, Superman also has gotten the attention of another billionaire, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), who, after suffering his own personal losses in the Kryptonian attack, has it out to destroy the man of steel.

The paramount thing to remember about DC's current cinematic universe is these films are exploring origins of characters that have been told and retold a dozen times or more by many different writers and in many different fashions. The only exception is Affleck's Batman, who has been doing his vigilante crime-fighting for quite some time -- as evidenced by visual (Robin's suit with Joker's spray-painted taunt) and spoken references (Wayne to Kent: ""Maybe it's the Gotham City in me ... we just have a bad history with freaks dressed like clowns.""). So, the critics' argument that -- particularly in MoS -- Superman doesn't act like Superman is a bit unfounded or, at best, moot as Superman is growing into and learning to be the hero us comic fans know. For fans who so adoringly remember and love Richard Donner's 1978 ""Superman,"" starring Christopher Reeve (who will always be the true Superman), MoS and this film are probably a bitter pill to swallow as this interpretation is definitely not the same. The origin may be there but the production, writing, acting and overall feel of the films are different. Again, I'm a huge fan of the Donner film, but if you go into MoS and/or BvS with the same kind of expectation, prepare to be thoroughly disappointed. If Donner's Superman was the golden and silver age comics version of Superman, then MoS and BvS are the New 52 comics version. And I think that is wherein mostly lies the problem for critics and fans. But I'll come back to that later.

There is certainly a lot to enjoy in BvS. Affleck's turn as Bruce Wayne has him comfortably portraying a hardened, weary, alcohol-for-breakfast-swigging Wayne while his version of Batman is darker, more ruthless, showing off his many years of fighting crime. He is the embodiment of Nietzsche's warning of becoming a monster after fighting them for too long. While we are briefly shown Batman's traumatic origin, I'm happy it will not take center point when or if a solo Affleck Batman film is released (I heard a 2018 or 2019 with Geoff Johns' assistance on the script is on the roster). This is a technique being used nowadays with comic book characters whose origin story is widely known and/or has been recreated on film a few times. Case in point, Marvel Comics' The Punisher's origin (which has been shown on film three times) is merely talked about on the hit Netflix series, ""Daredevil""; and Spider-Man (whose origin has been shown on film two times) will be rebooted and reintroduced to filmgoers in this year's ""Captain America: Civil War"" and eventually in his own standalone film, which has already been announced will not be an origin story. Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Wayne's butler, Alfred, was good as he vocalizes the central theme to BvS: fear. ""That's how it starts. The fever, the rage, the feeling of powerlessness that turns good men ... cruel.""

Gal Gadot's Diana Prince/Wonder Woman is the mysterious figure to intrigue audiences, getting them pumped up not just for the upcoming Justice League film but also for her long overdue standalone film (look closely and you'll spot a slightly blurry pic of Chris Pine as Steve Trevor). I found the photographic hint of her history was certainly enough to get me excited for the films and I think her role in the final battle is integral to showing audiences just how powerful she is (some don't know her power almost equals that of Superman's). I think not fully utilizing her in this film was a wise move as the filmmakers had, they would've risked jamming too much into a film with already a lot going on. There's a moment during her battle with the major baddie -- those who've seen the trailer know it's Doomsday (as in the monster who was responsible for killing Superman in the 1990s comic book run) -- when she actually smiles after being hit by the monster, and I couldn't help but smile myself. Also, when she, Batman and Superman first share screen time before their battle, even though there is little dialogue, their chemistry together feels, looks and sounds like what they are known for in the comics. Amy Adams' Lois Lane worked in BvS and she proves she is one of Superman's few tethers to a world in which he still doesn't feel comfortable yet; plus, her chemistry with Henry Cavill improved. I also loved the intriguing twist of Jimmy Olsen as a spy. What got me most excited, though, were the cameos of a majority of the rest of the Justice League: Ezra Miller's Flash, Jason Mamoa's Aquaman, and Ray Fisher's Cyborg (which all ran longer than I thought).

As for the two more contentious characters (and their portrayals), Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor has drawn the most ire as many didn't take well to his particular brand of acting. Some have compared him to his Mark Zuckerberg portrayal from ""The Social Network"": a nerdy, awkward, fidgeting dork doing his best to be threatening. While Eisenberg's portrayal (as any of the other parts in the film) is more a testament to the writers' version of Luthor, it should also be said that this Luthor is not the brawny, intimidating Luthor currently shown in DC's comic but rather the younger Lex prominently featured in Geoff Johns' ""Secret Origin"" comic. While that may be no excuse for letting down people's expectation, the fact that this is Luthor's introduction to the new cinematic universe and he's young proves that the Luthor all fans have grown to love to hate still has to do a bit more growing himself. What I do find ironic is that people/fans who are so in love with Donner's film would be so critical of this film, but expectations are high. It's a good thing Donner's Superman and Superman II weren't released today -- as critics would pan those films! I can hear it now. ""Isn't Luthor's ultimate plan of sinking California a bit too simple a plot point?"" ""Turning the earth backward to turn back time? Seriously!?"" ""A super kiss that makes Lois forget? C'mon!"" ""Margot Kidder's acting?"" And ""Gene Hackman's comedic approach to portraying Lex Luthor?"" Nevertheless, I can understand people's issues with Eisenberg's portrayal and if it's not for you, it's easy to see why. One of my biggest complaints was the sore underusage of Luthor's assistant, Mercy Graves (Tao Okamoto), who was first created for ""Superman: The Animated Series"" and is quite a formidable foe!

The second supposedly abused character usage is of Doomsday, the Luthor-created Kryptonian monster best known for his introduction by killing Superman in the 1992 DC Comics storyline, ""The Death of Superman."" Critics are quick to point out they thought the character was some mindless, horrible-looking thing which resembled the dopey Bane in Schumacher's ""Batman & Robin."" However, unlike Bane in the comics, the comics version of Doomsday, when first introduced, does not talk and is merely a rage-filled killing machine that simply wants to destroy, there is no other motivation. So the portrayal of Doomsday here is quite on the mark. If there is one minor issue I had about BvS it's the inconsistency of teetering between origin story and throwing in what only comic fans would most likely know. Most of us know the basics of why Luthor first dislikes Superman, but if BvS is supposed to be an origin story for the two characters -- and especially their relationship -- I feel the filmmakers could or should have written some kind of more obvious scene to better explain Luthor's jealousy as the scene at the benefit gala did not cut it. Still, it's extremely difficult to make a film about a character who's already been portrayed so many times before. Another element I didn't care for was the writers' weakening of Superman, which has been shown on film ever since the Modern Age (mid-1980s), and is shown in BvS when a non-Kryptonite bomb explodes near him.

What I loved most about BvS was the final battle scenes. I won't get into too much detail as I don't want to spoil anything but I thought both were well-executed with great pacing and acting thrown in for good measure. The bottom line is: BvS is not the spectacular film everyone hyped it up in their minds to be, but it's also not the snore-fest most critics are painting it to be. If you're a fan of Superman and/or DC Comics, you're gonna most likely enjoy this film. If not, at least DC Comics and Warner Bros. have given us a barrage of characters (stemming from BvS) whose films will be forthcoming and can thus give us high hopes from this point on!",1459468800,8,11410,4.827286663260092

I left nearly three hours later stunned at having watched the DC Universe successfully jump from the comic book page to the screen in an emotionally charged, operatic epic that even when it failed or misfired, was shooting for the heavens with its scope, intent, and moxie! This is a film that wears its emotions on its sleeve and its ideas are huge and thought provoking. This film has stayed in my imagination since I saw it and I thoroughly believe it will be with me for a long, long time to come. There's enough substance and gravitas in this film to fill a dozen Hollywood blockbusters and that's the ultimate compliment. The world building, the character arcs, the realistic portrayal of a world where the DC Trinity (and their entire universe) exists is absolutely extraordinary. No more does Batman or Superman stand alone in their own films. No, they are superbly realized TOGETHER for the first time along with a massive cast and stage to stand on that connects and weaves a tapestry of backstory and possibility that is only beginning to take shape. And this film adds to and enhances what was a fine film in its own right in Man of Steel. And Dawn of Justice is a film that pulls no punches either. Its dark, dangerous and serious. But its pure, modern DC Universe from Post Crisis to New 52 filtered through a massive IMAX camera lens. Wow. What a film. I personally cannot wait to own the three hour R-rated director's cut come July. For now, I'll just have to settle with going to see it at my local cinema's IMAX theatre.",1459209600,8,1660,4.592592592592593

7712006,5,B01DEBC8DS,"Batman Vs Superman
 I might be the only reviewer on the planet that liked this movie and I liked it a lot.  This thing is, as they used to say in the 1950s, Stupendous.  It really is.  It feels like getting thrown into a tornado and spun around for two and a half hours.  It is the loudest movie I have seen, maybe ever, and the pace does not slacken at all.  It doesn't slow down to develop the characters.  It doesn't slow down to explain plot events.  Like an avalanche it just keeps on rolling, ignoring our conventions and even our wishes.
 Israeli actress Gal Gadot, late of the 'Fast and Furious' fabulously successful films, plays Wonder Woman.  She just pops up in the story, totally from nowhere.  She sees that Superman and Batman have screwed things up so completely that she finds her self compelled to come out of retirement after almost 100 years to lend a hand.  Critics didn't much like that but I am perfectly OK with a 100 year old or older super hero entering the story full blown with no good explanation.
 I am OK with Batman-by the way, wonderfully acted by Ben Affleck, who would have guessed?-having very serious mental issues.  A stack of his friends at Wayne Enterprises died in the last film as collateral damage.  Batman blames their demise on Superman.  He thinks Superman should have been more careful of human life.  He comes to believe that Superman doesn't care much about human life, as he is after all a space alien from a different planet, Kyrpton.
 Superman, again played by Henry Cavill and well played, buys into that sad look at things to a degree.  He thinks that he perhaps does more harm than good and perhaps should step back, to fade into retirement and stop the Super Hero business entirely.  It is always useful to question our own actions and motives.  But he does not go nearly as far as Batman would like.  Batman thinks that Superman, with his Godlike powers, has become Godlike to too many people.  Batman wants to take Superman off the board, for the public good, of course.  He has his famous Batman gadgets to help him, but now re-enforced with Kyrptonite.
 Amy Adams does her best in the smaller role as Lois, the intrepid reporter who loves Superman.  Lawrence Fishburne plays the angry, driven, cynical news editor Perry White with a believable vigor.  Diane Lane fills the role of Martha Kent, Superman's adopted mom.  Jeremy Irons has a much too small role as Alfred, the Wayne family butler.  Holly Hunter gets to play a powerful senator.  All these seasoned professional actors come up to the mark.
 But Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor makes the most of his time on screen.  His Lex Luthor brings that character into the new century.  His Lex is a tech-wizard, perhaps a genius and as played by Eisenberg, absolutely insane.  He lets his crazy out at a public gathering in a scene that makes the film for me.
 Co-writer Chris Terrio has a slender resume in Hollywood but did pen the script for ""Argo"" to excellent success.  His team mate David S. Goyer has a lot more experience as a writer.  He has about 30 writing credits including seven credits for either Batman or Superman related films.  They produced a script that allowed director Zack Snyder to craft the scope and pace of the film to his vision.  Other critics also didn't much like the lack of dialog in the film.  Terrio and Goyer wrote in enough dialog so that we could tell what was what, but left enough as blank pages so that director Snyder could fill in the space with amazing action.  Known for his innovation and imagination, Zack Snyder has directed such films as ""300"", ""The Watchmen"", the 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" and the 2013 prequel to this film, ""Man of Steel"".  He can do it.
 The people seem to like this kind of film, a film that simply sweeps the viewer up in the action and carries him away.  Many skeptics thought that spending a quarter of a billion dollars to make a movie was the very definition of folly.  But people are lining up.  ""Batman vs Superman"" had the sixth largest domestic opening week end of all time and took in an enormous $424 million world wide.  The PG-13 film lasts a very long two hours and 31 minutes, but believe me it does not run too long.  The studio is projected to release an even longer 'directors cut' version in due time.
 I think this is an amazing film and give it an outstanding four out of five saw-blades.  It is the most important film of the year so far.",1459209600,112,4449,4.5
7712007,5,B01DEBC8DS,Absolutely loved this movie.  This blu ray will be playing all of the time when it comes out.

7712011,3,B01DEBC8DS,"You may inwardly groan, as did I, in the first couple of minutes of ""Batman V. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" as we are once again taken through a cinematic narrative of the loss of Bruce Wayne's parents.  But this is mercifully short and the remainder of the introduction which finds Metropolis in the middle of the duel between Superman and Zod as witnessed in ""Man of Steel"" comes to us via an adult Bruce Wayne rushing into the carnage and we get to experience it, including the loss, from his perspective as he watches gods do battle in this shining city.  We get to experience the horrific and have a sense of its aftermath and this is an important moment in the film as it gives the viewer Batman's impetus and emotional weight to bring Superman ""down to earth"".  It's a clever way, a good way to start the film.  What follows is a patchwork of moving pieces that detail Batman's movements to gear up to defeat Krypton's last son (including a couple of nightmarish, brutal dreams that he has that almost feel like premonitions), that show Clark Kent/ Superman saving the day and being worshipped as a savior on the one hand while on the other the government is calling for him to not act unilaterally (a great storyline which, unfortunately, literally burns out--you'll see what I mean--and so ultimately goes nowhere), and that chronicle Lex Luthor's scheming efforts to bring down both the Bat and the god (there is a lot of religious/ theological associations and questions that the film asks/ makes including derivations on the classic ""If God is perfectly good and all-powerful then why doesn't he stop evil?  If he doesn't stop evil then he isn't all-powerful, or  he isn't perfectly good.""  Although while the film plays with these notions it seems obvious that the director sees Superman in Christological terms).  The ending turns into the requisite superhero slugfest with Batman and Supes initially duking it out (which was kinda cool and well-done) and then joining forces, along with Wonder Woman, to defeat a monstrous threat (which was kinda lame).

""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"" has some things going for it and some against it but ultimately suffers under the weight of heavy-handed direction that tries to imbue each scene with dense emotional weight (emphasize that).  The end result of this effort strangely denudes the film of its emotional significance, as if your emotional receptors get burnt out waiting for the pay-off and so when it comes it doesn't resonate.  Is it because every moment hangs with a heaviness, an intended significance, and that there aren't recognitions of lighter or different moods?  Possibly.  But probably just as much it's because the whole film's color palette is dark and/or de-saturated in tone and that not only sets but sustains a dour, heavy mood which can wear a viewer out.  It also reaches for too much (insert ""Spider-man 3"" or ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" criticism here).  The narrative conflict of man versus god as embodied by Batman fighting Superman is made to give way to the service of bringing them together so that a cinematic Justice League could come into being and one of the film's missed moments, that scene where Batman is about to end it with Superman but stops cold in his tracks, doesn't quite jibe with everything we'd been given up to that point in the film.  If they would have spent more time on that and cut out the ending as it was then I think the movie would have been better for it (coulda even been a two-parter!).  All that being said the movie does have its strong points, and strong scenes too.  The central story including how Lex Luthor is used is actually quite good and the relationships between characters is natural and on point (I love Laurence Fishburne's portrayal of Lois Lane's boss, Daily Planet editor Perry White).  There are also some great scenes/ good pay-offs such as when Superman does willingly appear before a Senate hearing.  Senator Finch's (a sharp Holly Hunter) un-nerving moments in the presence of Superman as she attempts to lead court against him is explosive, surprising, and an important and shocking moment in the film.

But this type of movie will be mainly judged on how it conveys an audience's conception of who these iconic characters should be, not a little based on the actors filling out the suits.  I think that Henry Cavill (Clark Kent/ Superman) has the right look for Superman and plays him with a measured reserve appropriate for an alien man whose heart lives between two worlds (and that suit looks great).  He and Lois Lane (played by Amy Adams who has grown on me though she still plays a supposed-to-be-surging Lane too demurely) are most definitely an item here, no ifs ands or buts, and that's satisfying.  Ben Affleck plays Bruce Wayne/ the Batman and he's a little stiff.  I don't mind him in the part because it is modeled here after comic scribe Frank Miller's version of Batman (older, wearied, grizzled, and devoid of sympathy).  Though he's physically imposing I question his gravitas in being able to lead what will become the Justice League.  ""Batfleck"" isn't who he is without Alfred (Jeremy Irons, given short-shrift overall), the technician behind the scenes.  Wonder Woman/ Diana Prince is played by the attractive Gal Gadot who does okay with what little she is given to do.  There is a moment in the final battle where she gets knocked back and she crooks her head and gives off a wry smile.  That was a nice note for her character, but it was also easy to miss.  Rounding out the main cast is Jesse Eisenberg playing the villainous Lex Luthor with a younger, on-the-verge of developing a psychosis verve.  He's conniving and is the funnest thing to watch on the screen.  He'll be back.  I won't comment on the three future members of the Justice League introduced herein as they are not given enough meaningful screen time for criticism.

In summary BVS:DOJ is a dense if not over-stuffed superhero character study that suffers from its overly emotionally weighting every scene but which does its job in setting up a wider DC cinematic superhero universe.  3.5 stars.",1458950400,4,6135,4.798479087452471
