Experts on photographing Yellowstone use the video as a reference when you visit the park.  Presented clearly, photographers can learn from the Gerlachs from beginner to pro.  Must view material.",1433808000,,310,5.019607843137255
8186384,4,B000OR4EUG,Very informative video.  The Gerlach's provide lots of tips in everyday language.  I just wish they'd included more locations in Yellowstone!,1394236800,,141,5.666666666666667
8186385,4,B000OR4EUG,"Photographing Yellowstone Park DVD is good, could have been better with more detail and helpful hints. Travel with John & Barbara on their photo shoot as they travel the region. DVD contains great footage of the park. You will learn much to plan your own photo shoot to the area and/or appreciate the beauty with some photo tips. They do describe their equipment and make suggestions on exposure and scene composition and off trail locations to visit to get that unusual shot.",1271721600,5,476,4.817073170731708
8186386,5,B000OR4EUG,"I've been photographing for a long time, and have perhaps become a bit smug about certain subject matter.  Take waterfalls, for example.  ""I know how to photograph those!""  Well, I don't.  The tips in this DVD proved that.

There are many other great tips in this DVD, meaning I'll need to watch it several times to take them all in.

I recommend this DVD to anyone considering a photo trip to Yellowstone National Park, even for advanced photographers.  Aside from the fine content, this DVD is professionally produced.  In fact, the tips presented have broad applicability beyond Yellowstone.  You won't be sorry buying this one.",1178409600,13,631,4.933333333333334
