8288041,1,B001CK7OKQ,"I'm not sure why this DVD has duplicate listings on Amazon, but at least it gives me another opportunity to post a warning. There is an inexplicable cut in the middle of this production, an entire duet cut from what is already a very short one-act opera, which excises the heart right out of the piece. Unthinkable and unforgivable. But regardless of the cut, this production has grave problems. ""Trouble in Tahiti"" is a wonderful piece, as accessible as anything Bernstein ever wrote. It's a shame to think that this musically butchered, operatically ""acted,"" poorly-sung production might be someone's first (and probably last) exposure to the piece.",1458950400,,651,5.093457943925234

8288043,2,B001CK7OKQ,"Was excited to get this DVD, but had to return it because it wouldn't play on any of my DVD players. I made sure to check which regions and it said all, but still no go. Hopefully it will get resolved.",1364428800,2,201,3.926829268292683
8288044,3,B001CK7OKQ,"Although it will play on my computer's DVD player. I've tried it on two different DVD players...neither work with my television. Love the music, love the opera...just disappointed I can't play it on my television - without connecting my computer to it.",1280534400,2,252,5.023809523809524
