7958227,5,B0000633TV,Very excellent movie about based on life of boy born with rare birth defect. The 13 yr old actor was the actual boy the movie was about. He can do whatever he chooses and is not stopped by having only half a body. Very well done. I also recommend documentary done when he was 35 yrs old.,1390435200,,287,4.052631578947368
7958228,5,B0000633TV,"Kenny is my cousin, he is great guy to hang out with always makes u laugh. My mom Georgia Easterday use to take care of him when was small. I remember going to family reunions when I was kid and Kenny would always tease the crap out of me. He can run faster on two hands than u can run with your legs. Haven't seen him in while hope he doing fine.",1360627200,2,347,3.8333333333333335
7958229,3,B0000633TV,"This DVD looks like a vhs rip, so a/v is bad quality. Film is low budget but still fine if that's your style.",1346112000,,109,3.782608695652174
7958230,4,B0000633TV,"This is a film that everyone should watch if they think they have a hard life. The mind set of the young boy is far above most of us much older. Very good story line the acting is raw,But that's what makes it so good. A must see film don't miss it you won't be sorry!",1106006400,4,267,3.7857142857142856
