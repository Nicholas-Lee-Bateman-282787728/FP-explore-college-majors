I wish I could license to make it available to American audiences. I'm sure it would be a great hit. Really don't know why we don't get these in US. There is a reason why this ran for 373 episodes and 18 seasons. Great plots, great acting, great, great, great, all around. This complete collection of 99 DVDs is bound to become a phenomenal collector's edition. Why is is NOT available? And why is it not available in US (non-PAL) format?",1472601600,,596,4.527777777777778
