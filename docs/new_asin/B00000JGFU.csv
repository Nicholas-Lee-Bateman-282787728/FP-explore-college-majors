7943628,5,B00000JGFU,"In ""Under The Gun"", Sammy teaches simple, yet effective, techniques on how to how to disarm a firearm. Like all of his DVDs, Sammy only uses straightforward techniques that work, nothing complicated or ineffective. I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to protect themselves.",1415232000,,278,5.2
7943629,5,B00000JGFU,"Simply excellent.  Trinity follows Ben Chamberlain (Henry Fonda) around wanting him to take on the Wild Bunch.  Reasoning is simple:  1 Legend vs. 1 Wild Bunch = 1 Historical GunFight.
Simple as that...  Little more to it but ya gotta see the flic.",1016582400,2,248,4.6976744186046515
7943630,3,B00000JGFU,"This February 1st, 1982 video presents the story of a small town who takes on the NRA and 2nd amendment proponents when they completely ban handguns in the city limits.  While this story is 18 years old, it proves that the  controversy and the debate over the interpretation over the Second  Amendment is not a newly debated topic, but rather a heated issue that  provokes citizens and lawmakers to meet at the arena of passionate  opposition.  The arguments that each side use are still the same used by  the National Rifle Association and the National Coalition to Ban Handguns,  and their advocates today.  This Nightline ABC video, with a much younger  Ted Koppel, clearly outlines the controversy over the right to protect  oneself and the right of a city to do what they feel is necessary to  curb/prevent violent crime.  I would definitely purchase an updated video  on this topic, but I would surely find that the old arguments are still  used on both sides.",956275200,,966,4.7696969696969695
