7868665,5,6304359772,"Designed for men in mind, ""Esquire Fitness for Men - All Abs Workout"" is an excellent video for anyone interested in getting their abdominals in great shape. The video, which features a lead instructor and two other men, gives the viewer an idea of what they'll be doing in order to reach their goals.
From warm-ups to intense sit-ups and leg raises, this video did make me feel that I did major work on my midsection than the previous exercise routines I learned from reading books and magazines. Compared to an ""Abs of Steel"" video I had purchased previously, I felt that this video did a whole lot of more good than most other similar videos on the market.
Overall, an excellent way to get in shape all on a sixty-minute video, ""Esquire Fitness for Men - All Abs Workout"" is a great way to get fit. I also recommend the newly revised edition of the "" Complete Book of Abs"" by Kurt Brungardt which is a must have for any fitness enthusiast.",975024000,20,942,4.4508670520231215
