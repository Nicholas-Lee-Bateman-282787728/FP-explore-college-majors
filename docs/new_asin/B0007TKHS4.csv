2242756,5,B0007TKHS4,"The Leningrad Cowboys: Total Balalaika Show constitutes wonderful irony.  I served as a US Air Force officer from 1969 to 1990, much of that time as a Soviet specialist and nuclear targeting officer.  The Cold War was America's longest war, (1946 to 1991) and our third most costly with 100,000 American service personnel giving their lives on battlefields from Greece and Yugoslavia to Korea, the Congo, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and scores of other places you may never hear about.  As students in my college class in ""Russia under the Tsars"" was filing in for the first day of classes, they were greeted by the Leningrad Cowboys and the Red Army Chorus hamming it up with ""Sweet Home Alabama,""  I began class by saying, ""Russia, what we think we know about that riddle wrapped in an enigma usually is wrong.  Welcome to the history of Russia.""

Five star fun!

2242757,4,B0007TKHS4,I enjoyed the show but felt there was too much editing between the musical items,1185753600,,80,4.4
2242758,4,B0007TKHS4,"This is such a strange performance piece. The Alexandrov Russian Army ensemble is a great surprise in that they seem to ""get"" what is going on. As the Cowboys stated in an interview, they were all musicians just in different uniforms so everybody got it in short order. Musicianship is very good. Makes one frustrated they virtually never never seen in America.

The extras are amusing. The additional videos of their more recent material are on their own almost worth the price. Leningrad, Where's the Moon, and Jupiter Calling are twists from a twisted band. My favorite though is Happy Being Miserable which is so descriptive of people I know, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.",1169424000,5,685,4.805084745762712
2242759,5,B0007TKHS4,"A prior reviewer wrote that the Leningrad Cowboys ""parodied"" rock music.  Their outrageous hairdos and stage antics may be a parody, but this reviewer believes they were dead serious about their music.  A group does not enlist the Red Army Choir for parody.  The performance was excellent, the singers nearly beyond dispute, and the music inspired.

A copy of Happy Together was not available. But the Total Balalakia Show was, and featured two versions of  ""Happy Together"": an original opening piece for the show and the original version.

The Leningrad Cowboys combine comedy and excellent renditions of rock music from my age of the world.  Long may they wave.",1156636800,6,664,5.036697247706422
2242760,5,B0007TKHS4,"Life time experience. It's unlikely you'll ever see a concert film quite like the one shot in Helsinki, with the Leningrad Cowboys and the Alexandrov Red Army Choir and  folk dancers.

Is absolutely awesome. The extras also is ""very juiced"".",1124841600,7,241,5.0
2242761,4,B0007TKHS4,"The Leningrad Cowboys are one of the strangest bands ever to emerge from Finland. Well, upon reconsideration, they are actually one of the oddest bands ever, anywhere. This concert was filmed in 1993 in Helsinki, Finland when the Leningrad Cowboys joined the Alexandrov Red Army Ensemble in what is one of the most otherworldly musical experiences imaginable.

This huge and diverse band performed a lot of Russian standards, which after a while begin to sound rather similar (at least to ears outside of continental Europe) but also feature cover versions of ""Stairway to Heaven"" and ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" among other rock standards. These western rockers are a sight to behold and a sound to be savored. I am particularly impressed (and amazed) by the rather extreme hair styles of the band members and the fact that they don't trip over their unwieldy footwear.

I recommend this DVD highly. It is fun and has many extras, such as four music videos, behind the scenes features, and five bonus shorts. I would have given it five stars easily if it had had a few more rock covers, and a few less Russian folksongs. Still this DVD is an absolute treasure and I highly recommend it to any music lover with a sense of humor or a taste for the surreal.",1119744000,12,1249,4.724770642201835
2242762,4,B0007TKHS4,"First the disclaimers: 1- There's no 'Stairway to Heaven' on this DVD. That performance shows up on a couple of their cd's, but not here. 2- A couple of the bonus music videos have sound that's slightly out of sync w/ the image (at least on my copy). 3- The remaining bonus materials are kind of 'fluffy', or a bit spare. I would have preferred interviews & behind-the-scenes that were more 'straight', not merely this 'montage of wackiness' approach.

But having said all this, my recommendation would be for you to purchase this dvd right away, and share it with anyone you can grab. I've never seen a concert film quite like this, or one that would seem less likely to be so much fun.

Turns out that the odd-looking Leningrad Cowboys - - with their sunglasses, pointed hair and pointed shoes - - were the most normal part of this show.

What you get here is spectacle. Thousands of people rocking out in Senate Square in Helsinki while an enormous Russian Military Chorus and Orchestra (and accompanying folk dancers) gleefully share the stage with the big weirdo Finnish showband doing rock covers.

No, you don't get 'Stairway', but you do get the Turtles' 'Happy Together', Dylan's 'Knocking on Heaven's Door', Tom Jones' 'Delilah', ZZ Top's 'Gimme All Your Loving' (w/ accordions), Skynyrd's 'Sweet Home Alabama' and others, trading off w/ your basic (but none the less bombastic) 'greatest hits' of Russian folk music including Kalinka, Volga Boatmen, Dark Eyes, and such.

The real surprise is how joyously earnest it all appears. Most of the songs may be American, but I didn't catch any cynical tongue-in-cheek 'kitsch factor' that might have occurred had this been a US production. Despite the rock show glitz, this still feels very much like a foreign film. There's just a different sensibility to the performances and to the way they've been captured.

If you enjoyed Aki Kaurismaki's ""Leningrad Cowboys Go America"", you should love this, even though this is almost an entirely different vibe. So actually, even if you didn't enjoy that movie, you still might want to check this out.

The Leningrad Cowboys have always been something of a quirky enigma for me. I enjoyed that first movie years ago, and was later surprised to hear about the existence of other movies and a bunch of albums. As there's been next to nothing easily available in the US, the mystery has continued. I'm happy now to have had the opportunity to fill in some of the blanks.

Now if we can just get a Region 1 dvd release for ""Leningrad Cowboys Go America""... (and the rest of the Kaurismaki catalog as well!)",1117324800,20,2599,4.785714285714286
8051563,5,B0007TKHS4,"I've been around. Music has always been my passion. I've seen all the ""classic greats"" and still  keep up with the modern scene. But I'VE NEVER, I REPEAT, NEVER, SEEN *ANYTHING* LIKE THIS!!!  Don't get me wrong, the music of THE LENINGRAD COWBOYS is really tight.  But when you combine it with a 100+ member Russian military chorus and orchestra. covering ZZ TOP (including costumed Russian folk dancers) this has GOT to be on the outer fringe of bizarre.  It's not only a hoot to watch but the music is actually spot-on.. ROCKIN' AND EXTREAMLY VISUAL!!!  The wild hair dues, the tractor drum set, the solid power of that HUGE, well trained, Soviet Military ensemble makes for an evening of entertainment the likes of which  I, or anyone else I know,  have EVER seen.  Included are LENINGRAD COWBOYS videos and a short ""history(?)"" of the origin of THE LENINGRAD COWBOYS.  If you can find this, love rockin' music, and, enjoy things that are TRULY off-the-wall,,,,,,,,,,,,,BUY IT!!!",1422576000,,982,4.867469879518072
8051564,2,B0007TKHS4,"I love this movie, but this copy was pretty much unplayable.  The menu showed up but did not allow me to choose anyof the selections and the same part (not the movie but the concert) kept playing no matter what I selected.  To top it off, when I let the concert roll, it wouldn't get past the first few minutes.  I am not pleased but I understand the risk in ordering a  foreign film that is pretty old to begin with.  The FILM is great!  But this copy was a complete disappointment.",1377993600,,483,4.195652173913044
8051565,5,B0007TKHS4,"SIMPLY KILLER GREAT from this little known bunch of musicians from Finland, performing with the Soviet Army orchestra, choir, dancers and what-all. Highest suggestions you run out and get this!",1355011200,,193,5.466666666666667
8051566,1,B0007TKHS4,The quality of this DVD is shocking. Even the titles are Blurred. I tried everything but it's just a poor copy. It's a shame because the concert (what I can see of it)is great.,1329177600,,176,4.205882352941177
8051567,5,B0007TKHS4,"Talk about ""Ice cream and pickles""! The ""Leningrad Cowboys"" (Of Finland) teamed up with The Alexandrov Red Army chorus and Dance ensemble! I bought this for the song, ""Those were the days"" that I saw on Youtube. Most of it consists of Popular American songs and the rest, Russian. The ""Cowboys' looked the lunatic with their silly hair pieces, insanely long shoes, and goofy antics. There is a distant ""Monty Python"" sort of madness level to this.

Besides the concert, there is additional content; Music videos and film shorts. This is not for everyone. preview on Youtube before you rush out to buy this.",1320192000,,606,4.826923076923077
8051568,5,B0007TKHS4,"I have been a fan of this band from Finland for quite a while.  You will probably never see this performed in the USA, it is way too big a production.  Highly entertaining.  This is a fine compilation of some of their best tunes.",1319068800,,229,4.159090909090909
8051569,2,B0007TKHS4,"The content was good, however the quality of the video was poor. Although recorded live, the sharpness, sound quality and the recording in general could have been much better.

The Leningrad Cowboys have better video on You Tube.",1302825600,,229,5.026315789473684
8051570,5,B0007TKHS4,"I was only disappointed in that I thought I was getting the show I saw posted on U-tube. The 'Total Balalkai' show is on U-tube, but the clips I am referring has female dancers. Not sure which show they are on and would love to get it, whatever it may be. The camera work seemed to be better, with many more closeups of the Red ARmy band. Marvelous close-ups in particular, of an ever-smiling, upright bass player just having a wonderful time. And the two female dancers were fantastic. But the 'Total Balalkai' show is a must have. There has never been anything like it before. It's like a fun nightmare. The lead singer is one of the best front men I have ever seen, the drummer's time is impeccable, the costumes are an absolute riot, and 'some' of the renditions are better, I think, than the originals. Don't miss this one!",1292371200,2,828,4.453947368421052
8051571,3,B0007TKHS4,"The Leningrad Cowboys are a throwback to the Elvis time, with costumes and all. The combination of the Russian Military Choir with this Rock Band is entertaining, if you like good oldies and traditional Rock. I enjoy it truly.",1211846400,,226,4.82051282051282
8051572,5,B0007TKHS4,"This DVD, as you know from the other reviews features the ""Cowboys"" and the Red Army Choir.

The satire of western rock music is absolutley wonderful.  The way the band dresses is absolutely hysterical.  The 'Cowboys' have 50's and early 60's American teenage boys style down dead perfect. Of course, the ""Cowboy's"" are over-the-top. Wouldn't be satire otherwise.

The band itself, consists of some truly capable musicians.  The drummer couldn't lose the beat if you held a gun to his head.  They work flawlessly withe Red Army Choir and Ensemble.  The arrangements for the 'Red Army' play off the 'Cowboys' satire perfectly on the pop numbers.  The Red Army Choirs 'hallelujahs' on Dylan's 'Knocking on Heavens Door' couldn't be funnier.

The band's stage antics are a dead-on parody of every rock band that has ever existed. Except the ""Cowboys"" don't do it quite right. Wouldn't be satire otherwise.

The most amazing thing is with each performance you think the band can't get any more over-the-top. But somehow they amaze and go even further. I laughed until I couldn't breath. A friend that watched this at my house  actually stopped breathing for several minutes from laughing. After he got out of the hospital,he bought his sister and himself a copy. I'm buying a second copy for another friend.  What better review can you have then multiple word of mouth sales.

P.S. the ""Cowboys"" have a web site. Get your Leningrad Cowboys gear!",1210982400,2,1441,4.929460580912863
