7858200,4,6303944795,"This is one of my favourites TNG episodes. There isn't a great deal of action in it, and if you aren't a fan of Data you might not find it so interesting. But it is a good story in its own right, well-written and with some excellent set design. There is also some significant character insight and background explanation, with the seeds of future events being sown. You do need to have seen ""Datalore"" first.
A near-tragedy has struck the Enterprise. Jake Potts played a practical joke on his brother Willie - and now Willie is in quarantine, infected with a parasite that will kill him if he does not receive medical help beyond the abilities of the crew to provide. But as the Enterprise is en route to a Starbase medical facility, everything goes wrong as Data easily and inexplicably seizes control of the ship. I like to see what an android can really do! Despite all efforts to stop him, he pilots the ship to an unidentified planet. He beams down to the surface, where he is restored to his usual self by his creator, Dr Soong (previously unseen in the series). Soong has summoned Data via his ""homing circuitry"" to give him a gift - but with the unexpected arrival of Lore, Data's insane older brother, sparks begin to fly.
The framing story with Jake and Willie is somewhat irritating for the lines given to Dr Crusher and the artifical time pressure it exerts on the whole episode. Yet in showing up an alternative brotherly relationship, it does serve its purpose.
The interactions between the two androids and their creator are at the heart of this episode, though. We get more insight into Lore, into Soong, and into Data - who, surprisingly, does not come out of this episode very well, at least in my opinion. Lore is hurt, desperate and full of questions. By contrast, Soong is a megalomaniac, indifferent, at heart, to the suffering he has caused throughout his life, and blind to the implications of his own behaviour; while Data is self-absorbed and equally blind. Yes, as ""Datalore"" established, Lore is a monster - but he cannot help that, and he did not deserve what his father and brother have inflicted on him. Sadly, the end of the episode makes it clear that it is Data alone we are meant to feel for, with all questions about past dubious behaviour conveniently ignored. More courage from the writers on this point would have made ""Brothers"" an even stronger episode.
Even if the plot does not grab you, it's worth watching this episode for Brent Spiner's acting alone. He plays Data, Lore, and Soong, but does it so well that you never think of it as one actor playing three roles at the same time - you immediately accept them as three distinct characters.
Give it a try.",1026086400,2,2700,4.6037344398340245
7858201,5,6303944795,"This is one of my favorite Next Generation episodes because it features Brent Spiner in three roles: Data, Lore and Dr. Soong.  It's amazing to me, when I watch all three characters in the same scene -- all played by the  same actor -- to realize that each character's personality and each  performance is so distinctly different from the others.  A lesser actor  couldn't have pulled this off... This episode (along with ones like  ""Datalore"" and ""Masks"", which allow Spiner to play  multiple characters in the space of a 45-minute episode) is a gem.  A  must-have for all Spiner and Trek fans.  Buy this one.",948326400,8,610,4.723809523809524
