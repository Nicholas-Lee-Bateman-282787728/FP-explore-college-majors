8177248,5,B000NDJPT6,"This video has easy to follow instructions, and breaks down the dance by the woman's part and the man's part.  The instructos show each move from several angles.  They demonstrate each partner's part first and then together without music, then together with music.  An absolute beginner could learn the dance from scratch, and, with practice, could go to a wedding or other event and impress people with smooth moves.  I had previously taken dance lessons, so this was a refresher for me, but it also worked well for that.  And much cheaper than professional dance lessons with a live instructor.",1436313600,,596,4.92
8177249,5,B000NDJPT6,"My partner and I enjoy trying to imitate the couple dancing on this DVD! We take it one move at a time, like they do, and eventually figure out what they're doing.  I would say you can learn a lot by watching this DVD.",1370908800,,218,3.9545454545454546
8177250,3,B000NDJPT6,"It is a good dvd, however, the woman's dress is so long it is difficult to see any of her leg and hip movements.",1343865600,,112,3.7083333333333335
8177251,4,B000NDJPT6,This is an excellent first step to learning foxtrot.  The DVD only covers the introduction to the Bronze Level of Foxtrot.  I woulh have liked to see an outline of all the moves in the entire series and to be shown where to go to get additional DVDs.  The teaching angles and instructors are great and do a thorough job.,1202515200,4,320,4.3
8177252,5,B000NDJPT6,"I have always loved the big band music of yesteryear and so, what better way to enjoy the music than by dancing along. My wife and I are really into dance right now. So, this was a great video for us. Sometimes, I felt like a kid, listening to the music that my parents used to listen to. It was a lot of fun for us to glide around our living room. We had a ball (pun intended)! We highly recommend this video!",1201132800,3,410,3.9518072289156625
