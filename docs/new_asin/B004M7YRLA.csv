4428738,5,B004M7YRLA,"I first watched this movie on the boob tube. I fell in love with it. Great love story taking place in the mediterranean.

4428739,4,B004M7YRLA,Beautiful filmography from Greece. The beauty of this film will catch your attention. I only wish the dialogue was all in English. Its a little hard to follow in Greek.,1309564800,,168,4.633333333333334
4428740,4,B004M7YRLA,"I came across this movie kind of by accident, and really enjoyed it. Since I am of Greek descent, I was attracted by the title, which for a Greek is like yelling , ""Yippee!"" The actors were great, particularly the 3 women dressed entirely in black,( which signifies they were all widows, as women customarily wear black for the rest of their lives at least more traditionally minded women do) who show up throughout the movie, as a humorous Greek chorus. The location shots are gorgeous, the food and restaurant traditional. Made me want to run away to Patmos.",1306022400,12,560,4.666666666666667
4428741,4,B004M7YRLA,"Archeology, like most sciences, has changed over time.  No longer do all archeologists grab shovel and brush, ready to dig, clean, and interpret.  Some use satellite imagery, ground-penetrating radar, and other remote sensing devices to uncover our history.  Eventually, however, it comes back to the person with the shovel and the brush.

In Opa!, Eric (Matthew Modine), a remote sensing specialist, is searching for ""St. John's Cup,"" a religious artifact that was also sought by his late father on a Greek island.  He partners with one of his father's colleagues, Tierrney (a morbidly obese Richard Griffiths), to discover the Cup, but the location is beneath the island community's favorite taverna, a lively restaurant with music and dancing.  The taverna owner, Katerina (Agni Scott) is a gregarious single mother, and her manager, Spiros (Alki David) is ferociously protective of her.

Katerina and Eric enjoy each other's company.  ""Never lie to her,"" counsels Spiros.  But everyone watching this movie can predict the conflict that will happen as Katerina learns that Eric is behind the plans to destroy her beloved traverna to find St. John's Cup.

Will their relationship survive?  Will the Cup be found?  Will Tierrney ever be able to pay his bar bill?  Does Eric have more than one expression?  Can I go swimming with Katerina?

Regardless of this predictability, I still enjoyed the film.  In both English and Greek, with subtitles.

4428746,5,B004M7YRLA,"Yes, and old kind of movie comedy, but it bears the freshness of enchanting open air sets, and the precious work of very good acting. Worth to be rewatched sometimes.",1461801600,,166,4.566666666666666
4428747,5,B004M7YRLA,Wonderful movie which gives a great depiction of life in the Greek Isles.,1461456000,,73,4.6923076923076925

4428749,3,B004M7YRLA,"Predictable romance and ending, but the scenery was wonderful and worth the price of the DVD",1441324800,,92,4.8125

4428752,5,B004M7YRLA,"An underrated sleeper.  Unique story with delightful quirky characters.  Good casting.  A little predictable, but only a little.  We were very entertained . . . and that's what movies are all about.",1433548800,4,198,5.09375
4428753,4,B004M7YRLA,"The major draw in this totally harmless and formulaic romantic comedy is the absolutely effervescent Agni Scott as the female lead.

Her strong, independent character, charming allure and healthy beauty are reminiscent of 80s  actress Diane Franklin, who unfortunately was never given the opportunity to carry a film such as this.

The plot, which is inconsequential in these kinds of films, concerns an American archaeologist who travels to a Greek island in search of the biblical cup of poison rejected by St. John the Evangelist (who appears to be some kind of patron saint in this community).

Romance and complications arise when he falls for a local widow whose popular restaurant apparently sits just above the ruins where the artifact may lay buried.

Its an inane premise that only serves to justify the romantic story, and it mostly works, thanks to an almost alchemically charming turn by Scott.

Unfortunately, as he does in almost every movie hes in, Matthew Modine practically ruins it with his whiny schlub schtick thats grown more tiresome and annoying ever since it kind of worked for him that one time in Married to the Mob. Even if his character weren't written as a selfish jerk that even his colleagues don't like, its hard to picture anyone falling for this nasally-voiced, hair-dyed pill.

But if you can overlook that  close your eyes and picture, say, Tim Matheson in the part, instead  the rest of the movie is a pleasant, albeit familiar, delight.

The Greek isles backdrop is a beautiful picture-postcard of a country that really only exists in movies like this and yogurt commercials. The running gag of the three nuns making facetious observations about the story is reminiscent of a 60s Audrey Hepburnish romcom. And the incidental Greek characters are suitably bombastic caricatures.

The late Richard Griffiths is unfortunately unsettling as Modines fellow scholar. Youll recognize him as Uncle Vernon Dursley from the Harry Potter movies. As depicted here, its not hard to surmise why this talented actor died at the relatively young age of 65. Hes positively elephantine, and its sad to see him uncomfortably moving about, climbing stairs and hobbling along a dock. Its too bad, because his character is delightful and his portrayal quite charming. Youll want to like him, but all youll feel is pity.

But all thats neither here nor there, because this is totally Agni Scotts show, and she lights up every frame shes in. When shes Greek-dancing on her birthday, youll wish her hand was on your shoulder instead of on that goofball Modines. When shes cruising down a Greek country mile on her bicycle, lifts her arms from the handlebars and cries Opa! as the wind blows her curly hair behind her, youll wish it were you sitting behind her, your arms around her waist, instead of that goofball Modines.

Why this gal isn't in all the movies is a puzzle to me, and will be to you, too, once you watch it.",1427932800,4,2937,4.897177419354839
4428754,2,B004M7YRLA,You cannot bypass all the ads that are shown before the movie starts. Otherwise a cute film.,1426636800,,92,4.470588235294118

4428758,2,B004M7YRLA,"The DVD forces you to watch 5 commercials for other movies. You can't skip them.

I'm OK with commercials when they go to pay for things that are otherwise free, like over-the-air TV or web sites. But I *paid* for this DVD. To force me to *pay* to watch commercials is, in my opinion, evil.

Also, the English subtitles are not correctly on a subtitles track where you can turn them on and off. They are recorded right into the actual video of the movie. I bought this to help me learn Greek by listening to natural Greek conversations. Having the English translation shoved right up there in my face short-circuits the mental exercise of trying to hear and interpret the Greek. I should be able to turn the subtitles track off, if this DVD had been properly mastered.

None of this is a comment on the movie itself. I can't watch it. It fails at the purpose for which I bought it.",1416355200,2,881,4.392638036809816

4428763,5,B004M7YRLA,This is actually my favorite movie.  The story is romantic.  I could live in the taverna/restaurant.  The dancing and bouzouki scene makes you feel as if you went on vacation to the Hellenic Republic.  The one question is...althought the video quality is spectacular...does it come in bluray?,1384128000,2,292,5.148936170212766

4428770,1,B004M7YRLA,"Beautiful scenery, Greek musical equivalent of Finiculi, Finicula for near eternity, script unchanged from ""Two Weeks Notice"" with Sandra Bullock, even the time frame, two weeks, was unaltered, bad science which should not matter if the film didn't culminate in a Power Point presentation of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR).  I thought it might be possible to pick a most tedious clich but the second grade class that wrote the script outdid themselves.  One honorable mention should suffice, the demolition expert who shows up to excavate the taverna, is armless.
Since half the movie is filmed on a bike going downhill, it was hard to understand why nobody ever had to pedal. They just opened their arms in one of the poignant moments of philosophical insight and yelled opa!
What keeps the movie from being a pleasant comedic diversion is that the cast was unable to awaken either Mathew Modine or Richard Griffiths, during the filming.  Angi Scott was the bright point of the movie and it could almost be worthwhile just to watch her energy and vibrant performance.  Even that doesn't lift spirits in a morgue.
The movie resists any temptation for meaningful dialogue, any real search for the object of the study (St John's cup).  Modine just sits on a rock and maps archeological sites using Infared Imaging from a sattelite mapping provider that he subscribes to while the alcoholic professor guzzles ouzo.  And it's about that compelling, although I did find griffiths weight a distraction as well.  Other notably fat actors, like John Candy and Chris Farley, are svelte by comparison and it was almost phisically painful to see his second and larger stomach so close to the ground.",1361318400,,1688,4.98576512455516
4428771,3,B004M7YRLA,"I have watched this twice and enjoy it.  I first saw the male lead in another film, WIND.  That is why I bought this one.  He has a better roll in WIND.  If you speak Greek, you will find this even better than three stars.",1357776000,,222,3.8666666666666667
