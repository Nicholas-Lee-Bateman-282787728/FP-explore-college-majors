8067263,4,B0009V78P0,"Thin Lizzy toured Australia in 1978 and this gig filmed on the steps of the iconic Sydney Opera House is what has come down to posterity from that tour. Originally released as a VHS release and still periodically surfacing in that format the release comprises only eight tracks;

Jailbreak
Bad Reputation
Cowboy Song
The Boys Are Back In Town
Waiting For An Alibi
Are You Ready
Me And The Boys Were Wondering
Baby Drives Me Crazy

As such it only cruises to 55 minutes and I have no idea whether that was the full gig or not. If there was more to this gig and the whole thing was filmed it's a miracle nobody has re-released it in a longer format so perhaps this was just a promo gig. And it was 1978 - back when bands weren't necessarily on stage for two hours.

The gig itself was performed in front of 26,000 fans who pretty much go off for the whole gig the band seem on form though of course one must forgive the 70's stage clobber which at the end of the day isn't too bad I suppose. I mean, I remember the 80's....  The stage show is fairly minimal as this isn't a normal venue for music, the stage was a mock up done for this gig so there is no massive light show or anything like that and in fact this outdoor gig starts in daylight.

At the time of writing some people are asking stupid amounts of cash for this thing on VHS. A remastered DVD transfer with a brief biography and picture gallery is quite freely available in Australia, I scored one at a clearance sale for not even A$5. So if you are desperate to have thing get an Australian friend to try and source it for you but of course then you'd need a multi region DVD player.",1254873600,,1644,4.189873417721519
