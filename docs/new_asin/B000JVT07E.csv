2679806,4,B000JVT07E,"... which was why we bought this DVD for. However, the fishtank was a little disappointing as I expected more active fishes. Also the camera didn't cover the entire width of the tank, so the fishes could disappear momentarily when they swim to the edges of the tank ... well ... overall, still a good buy for me since the fireplace is what I am aiming for.",1198886400,3,356,4.3283582089552235
2679807,5,B000JVT07E,"I thought this was a great DVD.  It's a DVD you have on and just look at now and then ... nothing to stare at.  My guests enjoyed is as well, listening the crackling wood while Christmas music played on the CD player.",1198540800,13,217,4.023255813953488
2679808,1,B000JVT07E,"The fire is OK, but nothing to write home about. The fish tank is the problem and was the reason I purchased the DVD. Someone went into a pet shop and set up a cheap camera focused at an ill-maintained tank with three fish in it that look like they were high on meth. Total waste of my money!",1196640000,15,292,3.9661016949152543
2679809,4,B000JVT07E,"This is a DVD containing 5 short videos, each about 30 minutes long. They are closeups of a two fireplaces (classic and modern), a campfire, a saltwater aquarium, and a lava lamp. The fire and fishtank videos are excellent, in sharp focus and with good, realistic sound quality. There are many active fish in the aquarium, plus some coral and a shrimp. While the DVD is standard def (480i), everything looks pretty good on an HDTV with a quality upconverter in the TV or DVD player. If you want a DVD with fireplaces and an aquarium, this is a good choice.

In comparison to the ""Fun View TV v. 1"", the fireplaces are similar, and perhaps a little better on this disc. ""Fun View"" only has one fireplace, equivalent to the ""classic"" on this disc, and the video of it is only 2 1/2 minutes long. ""Fun View"" has a single goldfish against a white background instead of an aquarium, and has goofy sound effects instead of the aquarium's realistic pump and filter noises. Both discs have a lava lamp. (I'd have preferred a freshwater aquarium.) This disc is a clear winner over ""Fun View"" in the ""fireplaces and fish"" department.

However, ""Fun View"" does have a lot more variety of TV ""screensavers"". Most of them are literally computer-style screensavers (zooming starfield, snowscape, etc.), and are literally computer-generated. Many are a static image with a computer-generated foreground (for example, the snowscape is a picture of some snow-covered trees, with computer-generated snowflakes falling in front of the picture). They're well-done, but do look a little fake. There are a couple of oddballs, such as the video of the running microwave. Plus there are seasonal ones, such as a jack-o-lantern with lightning in the background. They might be useful to play as a sort of animated decoration for a party. For variety at the expense of quality, ""Fun View"" is a reasonable choice.

Since neither is terribly expensive, a third option is to simply get both.",1192060800,64,1961,4.865269461077844
2679810,5,B000JVT07E,"When I found the lava bubble dvd, I was really excited and jazzed about finding some artsy visual to project for my up coming christmas bash. I actually wanted to see what other products vjworld put out and found the fireplace and fishtank that looks so cool!! I've already visualized when I will play the fireplace at my party - when I need everyone to relax and wind down - sweet.

It's definitely a must have classic and it has a variety of fireplaces to choose from, making it incredibly versatile.  I just ordered my copy and I can't wait! My family and friends are really going to enjoy this dvd.

keep it up, I can't wait to find more about you guys, we need more stuff like this!  I just found a bit of heaven for me and my new projector.

I expected a true outdoor fire, with logs that look like they were just cut for that purpose, maybe rocks around it. The aquarium was a disappointment, too. The tank is boring and the equipment slightly dirty. I wish they'd disguised it with something. I'd prefer an aquarium with a lot of green plants and fresh water fish. The salt water fish are few and far between in this, and not the greatest or colorful choices. The only part I watch is the CLASSIC fireplace, which is very nice. I love NOT having any music, and just listening to the crackling of the fire while drawing or writing.",1457654400,3,709,4.503875968992248

Maybe it was mind over matter, but a neat effect.  There are 2 fireplace videos: one classic and the other one is modern.  Both have great sound effects, with the popping and crackling of the fire.  There is also a campfire, which was filmed at night, and has the sounds of the crackling fire and the sound of crickets chirping in the background, which was a nice touch.  The next video is the fishtank which has a beautiful and colorful background with tropical fish.  You can hear the aerator bubbling in the background.  The last video is the lava lamp, which is cool, but absolutely no sound effects at all.  It is completely silent.  Overall, I highly recommend this DVD, which does play each video continuously, until you hit the stop button.",1425600000,,888,4.634615384615385

2679920,5,B000JVT07E,"My Daddy loves a fire but he was in poor health and wanted the room very cold all the time, so no wood fire. When we moved him to hospice I took it with us. He loved it. If my brother had turned on a football game or something he would ask that the fire be turned back on when it was over. I kept it going much of the time. It was neat to wake up in the middle of the night (I stayed there with him) and have the fire going. By the time I left most of the staff had ordered this DVD.

Be advised that the gain is pretty low so you have to crank the volume to here the snap and crackle. The sounds were so realistic that once when it popped it scared the nurse in the room.  It even has several types of fires which seems strange but they do look a bit different. Although I really bought this for the fireplaces the aquarium isn't bad  (Aquariums DVD - Aquarium TV Jukebox - 8 Fish Tanks with Natural Sounds and Music is better for just fishies) and the lava lamp is soothing. I think it would be great for a babies/kid's room. Lava lamp doesn't have any sound.",1418169600,4,1061,3.925581395348837

It has just the right crackle and look to be perfect.  I swear it makes us feel warmer.  And it has turned our dining room into a cozy destination, when it was not before.  In the winter, we turn it on every morning, and enjoy it thought the day.

The other options are fine - and the lava lamp is cool - but we always have the classic fireplace on so we don't use them. (I suspect there are less irritating fish tank options, though, if that is what you are after; the fish in this one are fast and nervous, and the sound is grating.  Nothing is tranquil about that fish tank.)

I am surprised their aren't far more videos like this, i.e. with more options for art, etc.  It is a nice mood setter and a great use for TVs which are otherwise black, drab room dominators when turned off.",1391212800,,908,4.090395480225989

You can hear crickets and other night sounds. Very cool. I only gave the disc 4 stars because the lava is kinda lame, and the fish tank is a bit boring. If there had been more fish and a longer loop, it would have earned 5 stars. Still, worth the money. I don't have a fireplace but love the look/sound of them. So...on a large TV, it does the trick.

Unfortunately, the aquarium is rather dull, even to me, and they rapidly lost interest in it (as opposed to a hummingbird video from PBS that they love).  The videos do a continuous loop of each one which is a good idea but I definitely could tell when the loop started over.  The fireplaces are nice and there is a choice.  Sound effects do sound like a real fire.  Not crazy about the lava video.

I would really love to see more of this kind of video showcasing things like thunderstorms and waterfalls....there probably already are DVDs of these but I haven't found them yet...will be looking.  Suggestions, anyone?",1387929600,,698,4.626016260162602

I am also looking to get a fish tank, but wanted to start out with a small tank which would go in one room and I would use this dvd in another. I was highly disappointed in how cheap the fish tank in the view was. The items in the tank looked were bland and I was hoping there would be some background lights in the tank. I had a small lava vase growing up so I was kinda looking forward to this, but it also seemed underwhelming. The fireplace may make this worth the $9..over time.

I also really enjoy how it just continues forever until I push the stop button.,1357603200,,511,4.111111111111111
2680061,5,B000JVT07E,"Introducing the best way to enjoy a relaxing fireplace fire without the hassle of adding wood, stoking, or having the smoke detector go off! This DVD also includes ""Fishtank"" and ""Lava"", with two fireplaces: ""Classic"", and ""Modern"". Also included is ""Campfire"".

""Classic Fireplace"": A very relaxing version of the fireplaces. With the constant loop function, the fire never dies out!
""Modern Fireplace"": Same as ""Classic"", except a different look.
""Campfire"": A very nice feature! With the sound of crickets in the background, the crackling campfire can definatly be a favorite!
""Fishtank"": A beautiful and very realistic feature! Like the fires, ""Fishtank"" has a constant loop function so you can enjoy it all day!
""Lava"": This feature is mesmerizing. It adds a great accent to you're T.V. room.",1357516800,,797,5.275590551181103

2680065,5,B000JVT07E,Awesome tape!  I love the fire choices and the sound effects are perfect.  It was a great addition to the Holidays and for those of us without fireplaces (or Acquariums) it made the room cozy and some said they could even feel the heat!!,1357084800,,237,4.363636363636363

It provided a fun atmosphere addition to the room.  Had several people ask where I got the DVD and wouldn't be surprised if some of them went home and purchased one off Amazon as well.
I've used it several times throughout this past holiday season and was thrilled with the overall DVD.
The 'crackling' noise of the fire also added a fun effect.
Would definitely recommend it.",1357084800,,543,4.520408163265306

The loop is pretty long (have not timed it) and there is sound that when turned up looks like a realistic fireplace. There are three versions of the fireplace, a traditional, classical, and a firepit. The fishtank and lava lamp is an exceptional addition.",1356912000,,407,4.746478873239437

There are only a couple minor issues for me, 1) They chop off the tops of the flames in the fireplace. 2) The aquarium pump is really loud, you have to turn it down. 3) The campfire's cricket sounds are too quiet. But those are minor issues.",1356652800,,309,4.166666666666667

2680079,3,B000JVT07E,They must have a fan blowing underneath these fires as they are burning at high speed which is not exactly relaxing.  The campfire is the best except for the irritating crickets.  You can keep the fish and lava.  Rather disappointing as I've found better amateur videos on the internet.  Video and sound quality is good however.,1356134400,,328,4.803571428571429
2680080,5,B000JVT07E,"I bought this DVD to use at Christmas Eve and Christmas morning so it would seem like I had my own fireplace. You can adjust the volume on the crackling sound of the fire.  My favorite fireplace is the ""classic"".  I put this DVD on during the winter or just to relax while reading at night. My Mom liked this so much she is asking for the DVD for a Christmas gift. I've only looked at the fish tank video twice - it's very relaxing and fun to watch the fish.  I don't like looking at the lava lamp video - the colors aren't very calming - not sure why they didn't use some softer colors, blues or violets like you see in some lava lamps.  Overall this DVD is worth the price.",1356134400,,675,4.052631578947368
2680081,4,B000JVT07E,"This product is worth the money don't get me wrong. I love the different scenes I can play on my 55"" TV and surround sound. The only one that seems a little cheesy is the aquarium. I got the sense it was filmed at a fish store in the corner. Also the fish had to have consumed large amounts of energy drinks as they dart across the screen at sprint speed. That or they were watching a DVD of sharks swimming in front of them. Either way - its hard to relax with the fish practicing for the olympics...what really saves this DVD is the fire scenes. If this is what you really were looking for when this DVD popped up - get it. Perfect scenes, fire crackling, and the campfire scene also has crickets chirping in the background. Well made, high quality HD, and for the money well worth it. The fifth star didn't get colored in because of the lava lamp (zzzzz) and the poor fish on caffine...",1356048000,,889,4.235294117647059

2680086,4,B000JVT07E,"Excellent video. The fireplace crackles great and is great quality.

The only thing that prevents 5 stars is that the fire does not die down to embers...obscure hwy I should have expected that but was disappointed to see it loop before that.

No regrets at all.

I love that you can play in a continuous loop. I saw ""fireplace for your home"" on Netflix, and was so addicted to it, that I decided shop for some alternative and similar fireplace/ambient whatnot dvd's, & I picked this one up. Its really entertaining for the $.
Unlike ""fireplace for your home"" the 3 fires don't get too stale too fast because you can swap around and watch the various ones, Plus they loop, so you can let it stay on for hours! I like having the fireplaces on while I read a book, or while Im serving dinner, you can hear the crackling wood in the background and watching the flames is quite mesmerizing!",1337731200,3,722,4.395522388059701

2680097,3,B000JVT07E,"We played our video at a kids birthday party and it became quite the conversation piece for the adults.  Something that was subtle in the corner, where it didn't matter it could not be heard over the noise of the conversation.  But otherwise, it is not something I would sit and watch for hours.  It is more of a 'novelty' movie that looped endlessly.  I liked how you put the movie in, and it would start automatically playing the fish tank.  The video lasted about 30 min and looped.  The loop was not a drastic change, and the quality was okay.  Nothing outstanding.  I admit I like the fish the best, but my husband says the fish tank is kind of lame... a tank you may see at anyones house, not a cool impressive tank.  But then I am thinking the point is for it to be a fish tank that may be at your house!  I was kind of disappointed in the campfire videos, which was the reason I got it in the first place.  I like watching the campfire on cable where occassionally an arm in a flannel shirt would appear to stir the fire or add a log.  In this video, the fires aren't as 'entertaining'.  No one appearring to spice it up!  The only fire we watched for an extended time was the classic, as the modern one did not have a very impressive flame, and the campfire one was kind of annoying to listen to.  The lava lamp is kind of pointless.  So it is a fun thing, but not quite sure it was worth the price tag.  It may make a good white elephant gift.",1326326400,2,1453,4.1138790035587185

I like this DVD for what it offers (3 fireplaces, 1 fish tank and 1 lava lamp).  All of the screen savers (except lava lamp) have audio with them (crackling fire / bubbling aquarium), but I'm not all that impressed with the quality of the video.  I don't have the best flat screen TV, but video generally looks pretty good on there.  The video on this DVD appears faded, so my only complaint with it is that the colors aren't as vibrant and the picture isn't as ""HD"" as I would like it to be, but I think it definitely does what I wanted something like this to do.

I'm not really into lava lamps, but it is high quality as well and have no complaints. I have a 46"" HDTV and am completely satisfied with both the video and audio quality of this CD.

Likes:

-the price

- the campfire had me laughing at myself. I was just about to put my hand over my mouth to cough as the smoke blew in my  direction - no I kid you not! And jumped as the fire spat sparks at me. Daft! It also has the sounds of crickets in the audio background and the crackling of the fire is slow and relaxing. Lovely!

-the lava I could watch for hours. For some reason, which escapes me, I find it sooooooooooooo relaxing, almost mesmerising.

Dislikes:

-Fish - they look as though they are having anxiety attacks! Swimming at top speed around the tank! Not what I was looking for at all. I started to tense-up just watching them.

-The classic and modern fires -  they look great - but - now this is going to sound silly - the crackling sound that accompanies them sounds like it is playing on fast forward and I found it stressful rather than relaxing. I had just been watching another Fire DVD, which had a great fire (only one) with slow relaxing sounds of the fire which really relaxed me. I put this on and immediately noticed the difference. Will never play them or the stressed out fish! Only the campfire and Lava.

Having said all that. This DVD, for the price is a steal. You won't regret the campfire!",1323561600,5,1426,4.2481481481481485

Along with not 1, but 3 fireplaces to choose from...it had all the extra things like a salt water fish tank and a lava lamp, that were icing on the cake.  One of the fireplaces was exactly what I had hoped for.  The other two are really good too.  One of the fires is a little cut off on the top which was slightly disappointing, but certainly not enough to make me regret the purchase.  Overall...this is a great pick and I plan to buy another one as a gift.",1322006400,,487,4.03125

So I got the idea to eliminate the armiore that held my flatscreen and instead, mount my flatscreen IN the fireplace. The fieplace no longer competes with the tv. The down side.....no fire in the fireplace. So I purchased this DVD along with three others as you can just never tell which will be the best. This one is my absolute favorite!!!!! The picture is amazing! I bought a sound bar (with cordless subwoofer) from Best Buy so the crackle of the wood is sooooo realistic!!! So when I want ambiance, I'll toss in the DVD. I swear I think I can feel it getting hot!!! When it's not cold enough for a ""fire"", I love the aquarium. It takes people a minute or two to realize it's not real. It's great and I absolutley love it. It's a great conversation piece and many of my friends have purchased the dvd after being a guest in my home.",1294012800,5,933,4.27683615819209

I tried a couple of fireplace DVDs, but preferred this one - the ""classic"" fireplace is exactly what I was looking for, filling the screen of my TV with a welcoming fire that pops and crackles. I've given this DVD as a gift, and the recipient was equally delighted. All I can say is: don't knock it until you try it!",1293408000,3,494,4.103092783505154

I was alittle concerned about some review that said the picture was not good-BUT IT IS JUST WONDERFUL---I don't know how it could be any better. I have 32 inch Samsung flat screen HD.

On the other hand, the quality is poor, the fireplaces flames are cut off so you can't see the entire fire (and it's not because my aspect ratio is wrong), the fish tank is very lame and you can see this very dirty filter right in the middle of the fishtank, and the lava..  I'm not real sure why that's even on there.  You get a bright yellow screen with a few lava circles moving around.  Overall, I wouldn't purchase this DVD if I were you!

It is strange how I feel warmed and soothed just by playing this. It is great when reading or doing computer work ---nice atmosphere. I am not bothered by the fact that the tippy top of the flame is cut off. I like the way it fills my whole TV screen. My cat (who happens to be 15 years old) went wild with the aquarium--he was fascinated by the fish. The aquarium is a little noisy, but the water sound might help as a noise maker to block out other sounds.  The lava lamp thing could be used as just a cool changing picture to decorate your room ;-).",1291248000,2,710,4.071428571428571

When you live in a place that does not have a fireplace and you want that warm comforting feeling around the Holidays especially, then this is not to bad. It looks nice on a flat screen TV and the crackling sounds are a nice touch to make it feel more realistic. The fish tank is not bad, but you can tell when it restarts. I don't care for the lava at all. But I've never wanted a lava lamp either..",1290556800,,440,4.057471264367816

But I want to see the flickering glow, hear the cracks, listen to it burn while I read a good book.  Now I can.  The DVD holds three fires, one lava lamp and a fish tank.  I find myself playing the campfire a lot.  The only problem with it is the idea behind it is that the campfire is in the woods at night.  Of course, that makes sense, but there is a very loud cricket in the soundtrack which kind of drives me nuts.
Also every once and a while the picture, as it loops, seems to pixel.  You only notice it if you are looking right at it when it loops, in that one tiny second of time, which is rare, but I feel that I did need to take a point away.
It isn't perfect but for the price, when compared to the other DVDs, I think it is the best pick.  Also I glanced at many of the reviews and, overall, this one seems to have the best rating.",1287792000,,955,3.8564102564102565

Then the neighbor kids came over, tried to ""feel"" the fire in the TV! What a hoot! Then when I changed views of ""my"" fire, I could even hear crickets as I was mesmerized by the ""bonfire"" that took place while making sommores!
Anyone who has half a sense of humor and needs to feel a little warmer on these cold winter days and nights, just put in your fireplace DVD and sit back and enjoy!

So when I put this on I was very pleasantly surprised to see such good definition and color, I am using a Samsung DVD player into a 32"" LCD FSTV, perhaps the key is that I am using a HDMI connection which I find improves my standard DVD's  greatly as well.

I got concerned when I pressed play and it literally said this ""tape"" was copyrighted and I realized when viewing the image quality, which completely pixelates into little squares on my 47 inch LCD TV, that a low resolution VHS tape was transferred to a DVD. I do still play the traditional fireplace from time to time when company comes as a conversation piece, it is pretty amusing. The fishtank visual is very funny, the production value is terrible and the tank pipes and filters are filthy. The scant fish seem very agitated. This too can be amusing though, in the sense that you cant believe that someone produced this, and that even more shocking, that you paid for it and are actually watching it. The third feature, the red and yellow extreme closeup of the lava lamp is just way too intense on a big TV screen. It does seem to be shot in a higher resolution than the fireplace. For a small, low resolution screen though, the fireplace would be pretty decent for its long burn time, and natural sounds.",1236124800,4,1123,4.564356435643564

2680153,5,B000JVT07E,"This is the second fireplace DVD we've purchased. The first was a disappointing thing with horrid music that you couldn't turn off, of which there was no mention on the label. We wanted to have a ""crackling"" fire, and that's what we got with this Vjworld DVD. We played it during our family Christmas parties, as we do not have a fireplace in our great room. People said they felt warmer when it was on - I thought it was only in my head, so this was confirmation for me that I wasn't going crazy. The fire is mesmerizing, as well as gorgeous and calming. I noticed people just staring into it as the festivities were going on, and several of them asked where we bought it.  The aquarium is also beautiful and calming; I'm sure we'll get more use out of it in the warmer months. We watched for quite a while, trying to see where the loop started over, and never did see a repeat.
We enjoy the fire in the evenings while we read - so cozy - all it lacks is the wonderful smell of a wood fire (got a wood-wick candle for this). I wasn't sure that we'd ever use the lava lamp - we are a little past our ""groovy"" stage, but our baby granddaughter just loved it! Highly recommended.",1232323200,87,1177,4.207964601769912

Fishtank = boring, had expected more of an aspect of a larger aqaurium, like looking through the window into a tropical fish aquarium - to me this may as well have been looking at a goldfish in a little, round bowl.
Also disappointed with lava.  Had expected some footage of erupting volanoes...not a flippin' lava lamp.

Anyway..musta ordered this in a rush without reading too much.  Like I said, fireplaces (which was my primary goal) are good.  Looked at the rest one time and no more.",1231804800,2,505,4.640449438202247

The fire is very life-like and the sound effects of the fire crackling and popping make it very realistic. The campfire even has the sound of the crickets and tree frogs in the backgound. The fish tank also has the sound of the water pump in the background. The fire burns with a great picture of the flames and logs.

It's sad because I love the footage, the other ones do not have all three options (usually just one), they are not as realistically shot (they look like Discovery Channel, not like a fish tank), but the quality of the others is superior.

The Lava Lamp is so bad on my 52"" TV that it almost looks like it was made for a 14 inch computer monitor and then stretched (you can easily see the ""pixelation"").

If you have a small TV, then the video quality is probably ok; and maybe get it anyway since there is no competition for the footage... but keep your eye out on an HD version because I sure am!
