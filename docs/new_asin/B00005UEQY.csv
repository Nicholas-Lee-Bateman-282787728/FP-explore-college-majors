1665540,1,B00005UEQY,I laugh at almost anything.  This movie was supposed to be a comedy?  The characters were annoying and it seemed like a kindergartner wrote it.  Simple.  There was not much too it.  Do not buy or rent this movie for that matter.  I couldn't stand to finish the movie.  I shut it off before it ended...It was a failed attempt at comedy.,1049068800,4,335,4.306451612903226
1665541,2,B00005UEQY,"A dissapointment from Harry Connick Jr., but then I guess he doesn't get offered the A-roles at the moment.  Oh but Harry, when you read the screenplay, didn't you see the train wreck coming?  The screenwriting has horrible for this film.  Perhaps the blame could be shifted to the editing if there were critical scenes left out that would have made the film's transistions and plausibility smoother.  I doubt it.  Poor writing for a black comedy with able actors makes for a poor movie that very few actors can pull out of a pit of mediocrity.
Sarah Jessica Parker does an excellent job at portraying herself, and Harry Connick Jr. seems a bit confused onscreen at times, I think wondering like myself why he ever let his agent talk him into this role.
Harry Connick Jr. lovers: go see Hope Floats or Copy Cat and save your money on this one.",1023235200,5,843,4.556291390728477
1665542,3,B00005UEQY,"This movie wasn't great...but it wasn't horrible either. The only reason I rented it was because I'm madly in love with Harry Connick Jr. To tell you the truth, he acted better in Hope Floats and Memphis Belle.
In this movie, he plays a hit man who, unfortunately, can't bring himself to kill anyone. The role didn't suit him at all. All he really did was stand around and look pretty...and sing. Sarah Jessica Parker plays his love interest, a nice girl who accidentally kills her loser boyfriend. She's  a little off balance throughout the movie, though. Like she's been handed this role and she doesn't know what to do with it. And Johnny Knoxville...he was in the first half hour and that was it. Why in the world is his name on the cover along with Parker and Connick, Jr.? He's a minor character at best.
But still, the movie wasn't a total loss. There are some hilarious scenes that save the movie and make up for everything else. Rent it if you plan on wasting an afternoon.",1020556800,8,982,4.4860335195530725
1665543,3,B00005UEQY,"Director debut for Bix Skahill, ""Life Without Dick"" reminded me of ""Death Becomes Her,"" that Robert Zemeckis movie with Bruce Willis and Meryl Streep. This one stars Sex and the City's Sarah Jessica Parker and singer Harry Connick Jr. She plays the role of a nice girl who accidentally kills her boyfriend Dick, because she's been ""informed"" that he's cheating on her by a Tarot Card reader. He, in turn, is a hit-man with no future as such, because he can't pull the trigger on his victims. Twists of fate make them meet and get involved in a romance that will promise to be full of surprises and black humor.
Not the best black comedy I've seen, but not a bad ""B"" film either. Rent it for watching it on a Sunday afternoon if you got nothing better to do: you'll be sure to get a few laughs out of it.",1016323200,7,803,4.324503311258278
1665544,5,B00005UEQY,"This movie was really well done. The cast was perfect and there were actually some laugh out loud scenes.  Harry Connick plays a hit man that can't kill. He meets Sarah Jessica Parker, they fall in love, and she starts killing for him. Lots of cute twists and turns, and some sarcastic humor as well. For fans of these two actors, I definitely recommend this movie!",1013126400,9,365,4.53030303030303
7954666,2,B00005UEQY,"the best part of the movie is when harry connick jr. sings. this has to be the most boring movie, on the face of the earth, or at least the first hour: we fell asleep...",1517443200,,169,3.857142857142857

7954668,5,B00005UEQY,"This comic flashback movie goes around in a circle and ends up back at the beginning! Sarah Jessica Parker and Harry
Connick Jr. are a perfect match in this underrated gem!",1358726400,,172,4.580645161290323
7954669,4,B00005UEQY,"Camp comedy doesn't appeal to everyone. I'm not some pretentious snob or anything who pretends to get stuff when no one else does. Seriously. Camp comedy is defined as ""an aesthetic sensibility that regards something as appealing or humorous because of its ridiculousness to the viewer"". There is nothing to get. It is suppose to be stupid, stilted and unrealistic. It is either something people like or they don't. It just so happens, I like camp comedy. And yeah, the plot here is ridiculous.

Basic plot. Colleen (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) accidently murders her boyfriend. She doesn't know what to do. Daniel Gallagher (Harry Connick, Jr.) is interested in Colleen and is a failure of a hit-man/wanna be singer that is suppose to kill Colleen's boyfriend. He won't kill anyone, she doesn't mind. They fall in love and team up. He gets the orders from his boss (Craig Ferguson) and she carries them out.

And for what it is, everyone cast in this movie plays their roles almost to perfection. Over acting is the key to camp comedy and almost everyone nailed it. One star off because Johnny Knoxville seemed a little too serious, as did Claudia Schiffer. In a movie like this, one should over act and these two seemed liked they bought into the characters and where way too toned down.",1354924800,,1293,4.767857142857143
7954670,2,B00005UEQY,"I think that I fast forward through much of the movie. The best parts for me were
the unexpected skills that the character Sarah Jessica Parker displayed from time to time.",1350086400,,172,4.580645161290323
7954671,5,B00005UEQY,"By accident, Colleen Gibson shoots and kills her gold-digging cheating boyfriend, Dick, a private eye who happens to have a hitman on his tail. Danny the hitman works for his brother-in-law, a cheerful but nasty Irish mobster, hasn't actually killed anyone, and wants to be a singer. He falls for Colleen. she likes him, too. He can solve her problem Dick's body, she can solve his meeting the mobster's demands that he kill people like Dick. Danny has an ex-girlfriend, who might still hold the key to his heart, two cops are sniffing around for Dick, a junk yard owner gets a conscience, and a talent show is coming up. Bullets, music, and true love are set to collide. ""Life Without Dick"" is a wild love-story, murder mystery that has layers of interesting characters and plot twists. The casting is incredible. Sarah Jessica Parker is funny. Good comedy for a nice evening.",1266969600,2,877,4.776315789473684

A great Harry Connick Jr. movie with a wonderful quirky cast.",1223769600,,213,11.529411764705882
7954674,2,B00005UEQY,"This 2001 film has some pretty big stars---Harry Connick, Jr., Sarah Jessica Parker, Teri Garr, Johnny Knoxville and Craig Ferguson.  You'd think their agents would have been more selective.  Sarah Jessica Parker plays Colleen, who believes her boyfriend, the big Dick (Johnny Knoxville) is cheating on her after a fortune teller had revealed.  She just wants to scare him a little and gets her gun.  It accidently fires and Dick is killed.  What to do with the body?  Colleen accidently meets a hit man, Danny Gallagher (Harry Connick, Jr.), from the Irish mob, that never has killed anyone.  It seems the head Irish mobster, Jared (Craig Ferguson) wanted Dick dead anyway. Danny gets rid of the body and takes the credit for the killing.  This black comedy does have its moments with its twists and turns, but I nearly fell asleep waiting for them. I happened to pick this up for $[...], so I didn't lose anything.  It's not as funny as I expected, but mildly entertaining. Oh and guys, get your mind out of the gutter, it has nothing to do with a dick...",1187568000,,1057,4.6702702702702705
7954675,1,B00005UEQY,"Okay, granted this is probably one of Harry's first movies so we can excuse the fact that he simply cannot act in it.....BUT....what was Sarah Jessica Parker thinking of!  She is the bright spot in this painfully dull movie and unfortunately she cannot carry the entire thing.  I actually felt uncomfortable when Harry Connick Jr. attempted to say his lines.  He was stiff and just plain bad.  Even his gratuitous singing didn't fit in.  And bear in mind that I LOVE Harry!!  But this movie is a real groaner. Let's let it die a dignified death.....leave it on the shelf!",1149379200,4,571,4.66
