4690673,5,B005GI60VO,"HAPPINESS IS...PEANUTS FRIENDS FOREVER pairs the tv special ""You're In Love, Charlie Brown"" with episode thirteen of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW.
""You're in Love, Charlie Brown"" first aired on tv in 1967. It's the second-to-last day of the school year and Charlie Brown realizes he's in love with the Little Red-Haired Girl. He spends the next two days trying to get up the nerve to the speak to the girl and let her know how he feels. Meanwhile, Lucy keeps telling Schroeder how much she loves him. One of my favorite parts of the special is when Peppermint Patty (in her on-screen debut) agrees to help Chuck out meeting that special Someone. The conclusion of the scene is classic comedy at its best.

Episode thirteen of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW includes five segments:

""Kite-Eating Tree"" - Charlie Brown gets in a fight with the kite-eating tree and makes it cry. Charlie visits Lucy.

""Sally"" - Snoopy steals Sally's report for school. So, she takes Snoopy to school with her.

""Camp"" - Charlie Brown & Linus go to camp for the summer. Charlie Brown gets sent home because he's ""trouble"".

""Lucy Loves Schroeder"" - Lucy gets upset with Schroeder.

""Scared Snoopy"" - Snoopy goes to see Lucy after hearing noises at night that scare him. He can't pay his bill and Lucy confiscates his supper dish until his bill is paid.

YOU'RE IN LOVE, CHARLIE BROWN is a great Peanuts episode. It's been released several times already, but it never grows old. The pairing with Episode thirteen of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW is a good match. This is a good DVD if you aren't a major Peanuts fan. However, for true Peanuts fans, the only reason to purchase this DVD is for the episode of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW which has never been released on DVD in the U.S. I wish Warner Brother would go ahead and release a complete set of THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW instead of nickel & diming themout like this with previously released tv specials.",1330646400,9,1955,4.600574712643678
4690674,3,B005GI60VO,"This was a very basic Peanuts compilation that those who fondly remember the comic strip will enjoy. However, kids who are used to more high-tech animation may not appreciate it in the same way. I was also a little disappointed with how many times the word ""stupid"" was used. In fact, in one scene it seemed like that word was used in every single sentence which I think was unnecessary. Other than that, it was a great trip down memory lane when life was simpler.",1326585600,2,464,4.470588235294118
4690675,2,B005GI60VO,"Please don't buy this or they'll never release anymore chronological sets.  The main episode is on one of the sets I have (think 70's PT 2  And the Saturday morning shows aren't all that great from what I've seen.  Not that the main episode is one of the better ones either....

Please go back and release 1980's PT1 and then PT2.",1318464000,10,330,4.360655737704918
4690676,5,B005GI60VO,"Good grief! In ""You're In Love Charlie Brown"", love's a funny thing, especially when Charlie Brown tries to tell the Little Red-Haired Girl he likes her. Finally in ""The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show episode, ""Lucy Loves Schroeder"", Lucy adores Schroeder, Schroeder ignores Lucy. It's another Happiness Is Peanuts DVD you'll never forget. Hope to see more Happiness Is Peanuts DVD's come out in the future.",1316044800,3,406,5.166666666666667
