2125370,5,B0002VEYUO,"This was the first introduction to these Christmas Special music for my 2 yo and 4 yo.  They both loved it and asked to see it again and again.  It brought back memories for my husband and me when these were (are) aired on TV.  It is a great introduction to these great songs.  Just wished that ""Heat Miser"" or any from ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" were included.

Great collection none the less.",1231804800,,400,4.28
2125371,4,B0002VEYUO,"Wonderful footage directly out of the TV specials.  However, would love to have more (this is a fairly short video)",1207267200,8,115,4.75
2125372,4,B0002VEYUO,"Well worth it.  It has the actual scenes from the movies, with the words in all caps along the bottom of the screen.

Would have liked it to have a little more, even an introduction for each song - but it's good the way it is.",1200700800,16,226,3.891304347826087
2125373,5,B0002VEYUO,"my 11 month old son loves this dvd. When it comes on it holds his attention,unlike other videos. It was a good purchase.",1200614400,2,120,4.260869565217392
2125374,5,B0002VEYUO,"This is the perfect family DVD. All ages enjoyed it over and over.
Perfect tradition to look forward to each year.
Unable to find anywhere and thrilled to have it.",1200441600,,163,4.466666666666667
2125375,4,B0002VEYUO,"My recently turned 3 yr old son has developed a taste for sing-a-longs, and I thought this would entertain him.  It worked so well in that respect that I fear I will be hearing Frosty the Snowman and Rudolph well into the next Christmas season!  It is a little shorter than other DVDs of this genre, which means I have to hear the same songs repeatedly when he returns to the beginning and starts it over again.  However, it has music and video directly from the TV specials, which means he gets very excited when ""his"" songs come on the television.  All in all, a good purchase.",1200355200,5,579,4.383177570093458
2125376,5,B0002VEYUO,"I bought this for my daughter for xmas, so we haven't been able to watch it yet so I can't really review it, but I am sure we will love it.",1190937600,,139,3.5161290322580645
2125377,5,B0002VEYUO,"This 30 minute DVD is a little gem, filled with Christmas songs from many of the classic Christmas specials, all with the words on the bottom of the screen.  I enjoy it, and my 3 1/2 year old does too.  Plus, I love these types of shows playing in the background when we have company over during the holiday season (like the Disney Christmas Sing Along and the like) since the children enjoy them and adults to too.

This DVD contains the following songs (included with footage from the shows):

Holly Jolly Christmas

Santa Claus is Coming to Town

First Toy Maker to the King

Jingle Jingle Jingle

The Most Wonderful Time of the Year

Put One Foot in Front of the Other

Frosty the Snowman

We are Santa's Elves

Give A Little Love

Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer

The Little Drummer Boy

All sung by classics like Fred Astaire, Burl Ives, Mickey Rooney, and Jimmy Durante.

Enjoy!",1134950400,91,884,4.5

2125441,1,B0002VEYUO,There are maybe 3 songs on here that are actually classics.  Some  of the songs I never even heard before.  Very misleading.,1419552000,,124,4.545454545454546
2125442,2,B0002VEYUO,"The only reason I didn't give this DVD a one star is because most of it is five star material, however, there is one ""classic"" included here that seems a bit creepy in this day and age. The song talks about ""kisses being the price for a toy"" and I do not find giving a stranger kisses in exchange for a toy an acceptable mind set to encourage in my toddler.",1419379200,2,357,4.042253521126761
2125443,5,B0002VEYUO,Great for kids.,1416528000,,15,4.333333333333333
2125454,5,B0002VEYUO,"My children are big fans of sing along DVDs. They love to sing and dance. So with Christmas coming up and the great price I decided to go with!  The kids love it and sometimes watch it 2 or 3 times in a row. I enjoy the the music as well. There are 11 songs as follows:
Holly Jolly Christmas (feat. Burl Ives)
Santa Claus is Comin' to Town (feat. Fred Astaire)
First Toy Maker tot the King
Jingle Jingle Jingle
The Most Wonderful Time of the Year
Put One Foot in Front of the Other (feat. Mickey Rooney)
Frosty the Snowman (feat. Jimmy Durante)
We Are Santa's Elves
Give a Little Love (feat. Mickey Rooney)
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer
The Little Drummer Boy (feat. The Vienna Boys Choir)",1416528000,10,690,4.348837209302325
2125455,1,B0002VEYUO,"I would like this if it stuck to the better songs on the DVD but I have to give it one star because of the song ""Give a Little Love"".  It is super creepy. Basically a Santa singing to street kids about how the price they have to pay for a toy is a kiss.  ""if you sit on my lap today, a kiss a toy is the price you pay. When you sit on my left knee don't be stingy be prepared to pay""  Because of that I can't allow the video to play straight through.  They should delete that song and re-release it.",1416268800,15,499,3.723809523809524
2125456,5,B0002VEYUO,This dvd just makes me happy.  It reminds me of my own childhood and my children love it as well.,1415059200,,97,3.85

2125461,3,B0002VEYUO,"The variety of songs was limited to a few animated Christmas songs from several older cartoons. I was disappointed, only played it once.",1389830400,,136,4.956521739130435
2125462,5,B0002VEYUO,"Exactly what I wanted, my daughter can read and wanted to learn songs, I printed out the words, but my tone deaf self could not help her, so she got to read along with the words on the screen and hear the right tone.",1389312000,,216,3.9318181818181817

2125484,1,B0002VEYUO,I didn't rate it because I haven't opened it may as well wait til next year! I wanted it for Christmas Eve and it arrived on the 12/29/13 oops too late. It was suppose to arrive on 12/5/13,1388448000,,188,3.973684210526316
2125485,5,B0002VEYUO,Very good for holiday fun. Granddaughter loves it and sings along with the songs..I will recommend to friends and family.,1376524800,,121,5.1
2125486,5,B0002VEYUO,I bought this for our 14 month old grandaughter We danced and sang the whole Christmas season!  This shows the classics still have a place in our modern world.,1358467200,,159,4.482758620689655
2125487,5,B0002VEYUO,I played this for a Christmas party I had and everyone loved how the movie scenes played in the background and it was fun to sing to songs we've known all our lives. And each song had its individual bouncing type over the words from a bel to a present it's a lot of fun and highly recommended.,1356220800,,293,4.068965517241379
2125488,5,B0002VEYUO,Super good tape for children. Keeps their attention and they are able to interact with it too. Tapes like this were made just for children. They are able to sing along with it.,1324252800,,176,4.363636363636363
2125489,5,B0002VEYUO,"This dvd is very cute for small kids learning how 2 talk. It has good songs and it also comes with a christmas movie which is also cool, this dvd is a super old school version tho, so if your looking for an updated version, this product isn't it. Overall very cute and fun sing along dvd.",1322179200,,288,4.0701754385964914
2125490,4,B0002VEYUO,"After opening presents and eating dinner on Christmas Day, the whole family - three generations - gathered in the family room to sing these Christmas carols.  At first some of the twenty -somethings were not eager but played along.  We found most of them were familiar to us.  At the end, the five-year old shouted, ""Let's do it again!""  He really got into the spirit of family doing something together.  Grandma loved it, too.",1294099200,5,427,4.716216216216216
2125491,4,B0002VEYUO,"This is a delightful holiday time DVD for kids and nostalgia junkies.  I love the songs featured (except for Drummer Boy -- I've never liked that song), especially all the classics from the original stop-motion Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer.  My biggest beef is that this is a very short DVD -- 20 minutes or so, tops.  But my kids loved it and played it a lot over the holidays.",1293667200,2,380,4.478260869565218

8032926,2,B0002VEYUO,Since it's Burl Ives--it's old but good.  Unfortunately they spend a looong time advertising other DVD's on this recording.  I didn't buy it for lots of commercials.,1520899200,,165,5.074074074074074
8032927,2,B0002VEYUO,"Lyrics are not easy to anticipate.  Words are sometimes a bit delayed.  Okay for the price.  Kids had fun with it, despite the poor quality.",1513123200,,140,4.52
