3630518,5,B001HM2CAG,"This is a documentary of two women  - one who wants her implants out, and one who wants them in. The women who wants them out wants to ""explant"" due to illness of a several ruptured silicone implant. It takes her through her journey with pain and suffering, and her doctor appointments. It also shows her rejection from the medical community, and most women for believing her implants are making her sick. It's truly a wake up call for women. We cannot keep torturing our bodies like this. The movie is primarily biased against implants, but does show equally a woman who wants implants, and the benefit it has brought to her life. If you are considering breast implants, or considering removal, or believe you are sick from your implants and feel alone, I reccommend this dvd.",1356480000,8,777,4.671532846715328
3630519,5,B001HM2CAG,This is a very important documentary.  I wish it was longer.  It was very informative.  Every woman should view this.,1262995200,5,117,4.75
3630520,5,B001HM2CAG,"This film by Carol Ciancutti-Leyva truly opened my eyes to the debate about breast implants, their consequences, and what the different motivations are for women to get them.

Not only does it take an unbiased and objective approach (one mark of an outstanding documentary), but it also weaves the personal stories of several women into its narrative.  Because of this, the film resonates as more than just an essay on the history of breast implants and becomes a powerful expression of how a woman's self-image can be shaped by society, leading her to have a potentially risky procedure performed on her and all for the sake of meeting our culture's standards of ""beauty.""

Overall, I found this film to be both thought-provoking and endearing and well worth the purchase of the DVD.  If you are interested in the history of breast implants or in gaining a new perspective on the complicated relationship between women and the appearance-driven society we live, or even if you merely have a fondness for real-life personal stories, then ABSOLUTELY SAFE is definitely a must-see.

I give it FIVE STARS.",1232496000,9,1102,4.967391304347826
8308927,5,B001HM2CAG,"After watching this documentary I literally booked my breast explant surgery the next day.  I'd been considering explant for a couple of years, but was on the fence.  I read Dr. Kolb's book, The Naked Truth About Breast Implants and just needed to be sure that I wasn't wasting money on an unnecessary procedure.  This documentary sealed the deal.  Since removal, I'm happy I followed my gut - my 9 year old saline implants had a moldy valve and I had a biofilm infection that made me feel like I was DYING!  My health has done a complete turnaround and wish I'd never gotten these nasty, toxic monsters in the first place!",1518307200,,623,4.526785714285714
8308928,5,B001HM2CAG,"I show this film to clients and give away so many copies of it and so many say they wished they had seen it before they got the implants. Many decide not to get them. If you are thinking of getting breast implants, please watch this. You deserve to know all the facts. This film will show you the procedure of putting the implants in and what it takes to get them out.",1500508800,,368,4.054794520547945
8308929,5,B001HM2CAG,"Want implants? Watch this. You will not want implants after, after you see what actually comes out of a woman's body upon explant. I have never seen something so disgusting. The malignant Dr. Rose needs bitch-slapped then placed in prison. Do consider real, genuine ways to raise your self-esteem and skip the shallowness American society advocates. I'll be keeping my B-cup not only in this lifetime, but any succeeding. As one professional put it in this film, ""Men would never put up with this"" in reference to the horrific  life-altering disease that implants cause, and the hypocrisy of so-called plastic ""surgeons"". Filmmaker interviews both sides, and shows footage of corporate attorneys versus activists, as well as a woman getting implants, and one getting them out. Surgery scenes alone are worth the ticket price. Make sure you're sitting down for those.",1496707200,,866,5.185714285714286

8308931,4,B001HM2CAG,"Examines the safety of implants. Features some women who have had implants installed and have gotten sick and demanded they be removed. Features a woman who has them installed. Insightful, some bare skin. At times not easy to watch.

Includes medical board review.",1463356800,,264,5.1395348837209305
8308932,5,B001HM2CAG,"I never right reviews but felt compelled to after watching this eye opening film. Very well done with voices from different angles and perspectives. My jaw was on the floor when the surgeon who removed the woman's ruptured silicone showed the gooey mess it had become inside her. I am a 33 year old woman who has been contemplating breast surgery for over 10 years and who hasn't gotten enough nerve to do it. I was always weary of putting something foreign in my body but had no idea of the serious complications. Frankly, this film holds a mirror to aspects of this surgical phenomenon that you will not hear from any plastic surgeon or find in any manual. After watching this film I know for sure I will not go forth with this surgery. Not to mention, the surgeon from Texas who advocates breast surgery in this documentary, I believe his name was Dr. Rose or something, really skeeved me. The only explanation he had for why silicone implants are safe was simply ""because it's safe"". He was also very condescending toward the film maker. As the creator of the documentary if he had called me ""sweety"" or ""hunny"" one more time I would've seriously clocked him.",1460160000,5,1163,4.596153846153846

8308936,5,B001HM2CAG,"I think every woman should watch this movie. And men too, it is important for them to understand issues presented here as well. It was shown to me in a class, and although I consider myself fairly well informed overall, I had no knowledge on this subject. I think it is important to show this to people to really get them to be reflective. I bought it so I can spread the knowledge amongst my family and friends. I would recommend it!",1386892800,3,434,4.304878048780488
