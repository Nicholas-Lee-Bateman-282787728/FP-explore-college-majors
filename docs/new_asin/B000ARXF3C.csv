2390476,5,B000ARXF3C,"Essentially, the choice is between this Bolshoi production of 1978 (Kultur) and the Mariinsky Theatre Tarkovsky production of 1990 (Philips).  The 2004 Boris Godunov at Barcelona with Matti Salminen is not comparable: the characters walk around in business suits and the experience is quite some distance away from Pushkin's play and Mussgorsky's opera.  Other DVDs on the market are either only of selections from the 1954 production, or without sub-titles (cheaper, but unless you follow Russian not much use), or from the mid- to late-1980s when the structural decay of the Bolshoi and continuous in-fighting had considerably lowered  quality.

I have no hesitation in recommending the Kultur DVD.  The production is traditional, the stage-sets are appropriate, the singing and acting are brilliant, and the conducting by Khaikin is impeccable.  Yes, it's the Rimsky-Korsakov version of Mussorgsky's work. As Sir Denis Forman comments in ""A Night at the Opera"": 'in nearly every respect Rimsky's version wins.  It depends whether you would spend a night on Balakirev's bare mountain or in the company of Scheherezade'.  So I certainly don't agree with the over-heated comment of the reviewer who gave this DVD only one star because he considers that any presentation of the Rimsky-Korsakov version is a ""crime"".

Nesterenko, who plays Boris Godunov, is convincing and deeply tragic.  Other reviewers seem to be put off by minor details - the quality of wigs, for instance.  Don't let this kind of comment deter you from choosing this DVD.  The power of the opera comes though fully, and it's a magnificent experience to which you'll want to return often.  To quote Forman again, ""It makes the Switzerland of 'William Tell', that most nationalistic of operas, seem like toytown.  It makes Italian opera seem like light music.  Its simplicity and directness make Wagner seem like Mad Max.""

Unfortunately, as an earlier reviewer has commented, what's usually the first scene of Act 3 (Marina with the Jesuit Rangoni) has been cut in this production.  But there's so much left to appreciate that this is an omission which can be overlooked.

Others have reviewed the DVD of the 1990 Tarkovsky production.  Despite their glowing praise(I have this DVD also, but prefer the Bolshoi production), the choice is between a more operatic (the Bolshoi) and a more cinematic (the Mariinsky) production.  The latter has typical Tarkowsky slow shots, a fair amount of overacting, and is unusually, weirdly, plush.  Robert Lloyd is an acquired taste in the role of Boris.  Olga Borodina in the role of Marina is very pretty, but at least to my ears Irina Arkhipova carries the music better.  The panning in the scene with the vagabond monks in the inn is really ""over the top"", just like when Robert Lloyd just after his coronation rolls his eyes because the appearance of a beggar-boy happens to remind him of the murder of the legitimate heir.  The liberties taken with the opera are many in the Tarkovsky production - there's no map in Boris' scene with his son; the old monk Pimen is not seated writing his endless chronicle, the simpleton whose tin hat is the object of the urchins' mockery doesn't have a tin hat, but a cowl.  So the fit between what you hear and what you see is not great.

If you must see a DVD of Mussorgsky's (rather than Rimsky-Korsakov's) version, then by all means you should get the Philips DVD of the Mariinsky Theatre production.  But an alternative to just hear Gergiev's masterly conducting of both the 1869 and 1874 (longer) versions by Mussorgsky is to buy the five CD set.

That way you'd get the chance to appreciate three versions - two on CD and one on DVD if you also get the Kultur DVD.

In short: if you're wondering which to buy, get the Kultur (Bolshoi, 1978) DVD.  Don't take my word for it - you can watch a number of excerpts on Youtube, and compare them with a couple from the Mariinsky Theatre production, say of the coronation scene and the scene of the false Dmitri with Marina.",1241049600,24,4019,4.884955752212389

2390478,4,B000ARXF3C,"The performance in this DVD is superb throughout.  This is a very strong cast vocally. The sets and costumes are magnificent, yet somber, reflecting the overall mood of the work.  I thought the portrayal of Xenia should have been more emotional as she pours out her grief, but otherwise, the characterizations were very good.  Nesterenko's portrayal of Boris is excellent, second only to Christoff who, in my opinion, was the greatest exponent of this role in the 20th century.

  My concerns about this DVD stem from the extremely poor quality of the master tape from which it was made.  Dropouts, glitches, and time base problems (mainly in the Coronation Scene) abound thoughout the recording, and are a constant distraction.  I was grateful for the mostly undistorted sound, but found that I had to adjust the gain in my system frequently because of the uneven audio levels.  The fact that the sound track is monaural is not unexpected given the date of this recording.",1175904000,25,973,4.920245398773006

Aspects of the staging (e.g. makeup) are at times a little crude, BUT the performance is utterly superb. There has never been a Boris like Nesterenko - a latter-day Chaliapin without the melodrama - and this is Nesterenko at the absolute height of his powers as an artist.

Another credit to this superb ensemble is Aleksei Maslennikkov (the Simpleton), whose plaintive cries echo in the mind long after the performance is ended. The comic scene at the country inn is as memorable as the marvelous coronation, and the dialogue between Pimen and the false Dmitri. There is not a discordant note.

8079125,5,B000ARXF3C,"What I will say here is primarily to supplement a couple of the longer and quite able reviews already posted.

First, as another person has already warned, get this version in preference to the shoddy release on the Empire Masterworks label, which has no subtitles or other information.

Second, do not confuse this performance with the 1987 DVD of the same production, with many of the same singers.  By then the sets and costumes have become badly worn.  Much worse, so have many of the singers' voices; e.g., the once mighty Yevgeny Nesterenko is in an almost shocking state of decline, with a dry hollowness and pronounced wobble.  The conductor there (Alexander Lazarev) is also much inferior to Boris Khaikin here.

Third, Kultur as usual is embarrassingly shy in its documentation, providing the names of only a handful of singers and almost no other production information.  This production was broadcast by the BBC in the UK on 5 November 1977; this commercial release is almost certainly taken from that broadcast (a second-hand source that accounts for some of the flaws noted by others).  The complete cast list (taken from a copy of the BBC program announcement) is as follows:

Boris Godunov - Yevgeny Nesterenko (bass)
Grigori/Dmitri - Vladislav Piavko (tenor)
Pimen - Valery Yaroslavtsev (bass)
Marina - Irina Arkhipova (mezzo-soprano)
Feodor - Glafira Koroleva (soprano)
Xenia - Galina Kalinina (soprano)
Nurse - Nina Grigorieva (contralto)
Hostess - Larissa Nikitina (contralto)
Shuisky - Andrei Sokolov (tenor)
Simpleton - Alexei Maslennikov (tenor)
Missail - Vitaly Vlasov (tenor)
Varlaam - Artur Eisen (bass)
Rangoni - Alexei Rumyantsev (baritone) [silent role here due to cuts]
Shchelkalov - Vladimir Malchenko (baritone)
Mitiukh - Mikhail Shkaptsov (baritone)
Nikitch - Vladimir Filippov (baritone)
Krushchov - Konstantin Baskov (tenor)
Boyar - Konstantin Baskov (tenor)
Levitsky - [unnamed] (tenor)
Chernikovsky - [unnamed] (baritone)

Fourth, the performance itself is an instance in which the sum is greater than the individual parts. The version of the score is primarily that of the 1872 revision, as edited by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov; the St. Basil Cathedral scene from the 1869 version is included, but act III, scene 1 from 1872 is omitted. Production values are completely traditional. The staging is from the pre-glasnost and pre-perestroika Soviet Union -- by which I mean that, lacking the means to employ the most up-to-date Western technology, the sets are very old-fashioned, being mostly painted curtain backdrops, though those are not without a certain nostalgic charm. Costumes are a treat, being extremely varied and colorful, though sometimes showing their age. Acting consists of stock poses and gestures, though most of the singers manage not to be too wooden about them. The film quality is a bit unfocused even by standards of the time, and the recorded sound somewhat on the dry side, though both are adequate.

The singing is generally good if seldom outstanding. Yevgeny Nesterenko was a leading Boris of his generation, and is caught here still in his prime. His voice does not have the fullness and resonance of a Nicolai Ghiaurov, but he is a convincing interpreter both vocally and visually. Irina Arkhipova, in my estimation the greatest female singer from Russia in the post-World War II era, is a suitably regal (if visually rather elderly) Marina, in resplendent voice. Her husband, Vladislav Piavko, is the monk Grigori who becomes the false Dmitri. I am convinced that (shades of Richard Bonynge) he gained a prominence he never deserved due to his marriage. While he styled himself a heroic tenor (Radames was also one of his roles), he always sounded overparted. Here he is serviceable, albeit not ingratiating in his lower and middle registers, but his upper register is strained and less than ideally steady. The Pimen is solid, with a slight spread in his top notes; the Varlaam is somewhat crude vocally but dispatches his aria with gusto. Among the other female singers, the Feodor is excellent, and the Nurse and Xenia secure, but the Hostess overripe. Among the comprimario male singers, Alexei Maslennikov is as always a superlative Simpleton, and the others good to acceptable except for an overly whiny Missail and excessively grating Shuisky. While the casting of Rangoni is listed, his is a mute part here, limited to walking onstage to make the sign of the cross from a distance over Marina and the false Dmitri as they embrace. However, the overall ensemble tends to minimize the defects and emphasize the strengths. The chorus is quite fine, and veteran maestro Boris Khaikin has matters well in hand from the orchestral pit.

Fifth and last, this is the best choice for a traditional Boris, which is why I give it five stars despite some flaws, though admittedly the competition is limited.  I have already dismissed the inferior 1987 version of this same production.  The 1954 studio film is a fascinating document but too heavily cut to be competitive.  The Mariinsky staging by Andrei Tarkowsky and conducted by Valery Gergiev has a fine vocal cast, headed by a terrific Robert Lloyd, and presents the score complete and uncut, but it is a curiously mannered mixture of traditional and modernist stage elements.  It is, however, a necessary acquisition for those who want a complete Boris on DVD. The 2004 Arthaus release is an ugly modern dress staging by Wily Decker and presents Mussorgsky's far shorter original 1869 version of the score.  The recent Opus Arte release conducted by Gianandrea Noseda of the 1869 version has traditional costumes but non-traditional sets and is afflicted with uniformly mediocre singing.  There is also an extremely little-known film version of Mussorgsky's 1869 version, made at the Stanislavsky Theater in 1991, on the import Videoland label, with bass Victor Matorin in the title role and conducted by Yevgeny Kolobov.  I have reviewed that in detail elsewhere; briefly, while the packaging and extras leave much to be desired (no cast list as here, no English subtitles, some printing errors, etc.), it is very well sung and given a riveting staging (giving prominence to the Eastern Orthodox faith by extensive use of iconostases for backdrops), and should be sought out by anyone who loves this opera.",1366502400,12,6353,5.168451801363194

Most all of these recordings are of the Rimsky-Korsikov reorchestration and that to me is the most familiar version. I was absolutely awestruck by this DVD and the power of the superb bass Yevgeni Nesterenko. His death scene brought tears to my eyes. Such power, such majesty, such dignity! The production is also majestic. The crowd scenes, the palace etc. no expense too great to make this a complete operatic experience. Unfortunately this was made in 1978 so the sound and color are not up to 21st century standards. But no matter the drama is there.
In the last couple of decades I've become accustomed to the original scoring by Mussorgsky to the point that I think it is the raw authentic voice that the composer was trying to convey. In spite of what other reviwers have said, I am thrilled by Robert Lloyd's Boris that I've heard and seen and have the DVD with the Marinsky conducted by Gergiev.

8079128,5,B000ARXF3C,"This is an awesome opera and production, which warrants a contemplation on the historic and artistic background of the characters and events.

Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov is based on a libretto linked to the Pushkin's play (tragedy in verses) on the same name.  Pushkin made a careful study of Shakespeare's history plays, the works of the Russian historian Karamzin, and the old Russian chronicles. He wished to provide a true version of events in a natural dramatic form. His play Boris Godunov was published in 1830, but there was no public performance of the work until Tsar Nicholas II allowed one in 1870, 40 years later and 33 years after Pushkin's death, in the same year as Musorgsky offered the first version of his opera to the management of the Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg. Pushkin's drama met with severe criticism. The dangerous democratic statement it made was censored, and it could be staged only with cuts (7 of the 23 scenes were omitted, most of them involving the common people). In Pushkin's interpretation of the story, the greatness of the historical Boris Godunov was unimaginable without his people's support.

Mussorgsky's Boris was rejected by the theatrical management in 1870, on the grounds that there were too many crowd scenes and that it lacked an important female role -- or such, at least, was the official reason given. Mussorgsky at first meant to follow Pushkin's original intentions and make the opera a tragedy without any love interest. When he revised the opera in 1871--72, he added the Polish scenes and the love affair between Dmitry and Marina; they enlarge the historical horizon of the work, but are not part of the fundamental mood of the opera, which is dominated by the figure of Boris and by the Russian people. Rimsky-Korsakov suggested to his friend Mussorgsky that he could end the opera not with Boris's death but with the scene of revolution in Kromy. It was in this revised form that the opera had its premiere in 1874.

Rimsky-Korsakov revised the work in the 1890's, reorchestrating it and making some radical cuts. His revision was criticized, and he produced another version in 1906 - 08, adding the solemn coronation music and the polonaise.

These insertions are typical of Rimsky-Korsakov's style of revision, nudging Mussorgsky's music drama in the direction of grand Romantic opera. That impression is reinforced by his colorful, bright instrumentation, his harmonic and rhythmic refinements and simplifications, and a division into acts and scenes which runs counter to the through-composed flow of Mussorgsky's music. At the Paris premiere in 1908, Shalyapin made Rimsky-Korsakov's version of Boris Godunov an outstanding international success, and for decades the opera was known only in this, the most popular version.

In the 1920s the scene outside St. Basil's Cathedral was added to Rimsky-Korsakov's version, although not in Mussorgsky's own orchestration (the contrast with Rimsky-Korsakov would have been too obvious) but in its orchestration by Mikhail lppolitov-lvanov. Mussorgsky's original score was published in 1928. Performed in Moscow and Leningrad, it was produced with increasing frequency in many different opera houses of western Europe from the 1930s onward. Meanwhile, the work was also staged in other orchestrations (by Emil Meingailis in Riga in 1924, by Dmitry Shostakovich in Leningrad in 1940, and by Karol Rathaus in New York in 1952).

The historical facts:

Ivan the Terrible left his son Fyodor an unenviable inheritance in 1584. Fyodor himself had been weak-minded from birth, and a regent was appointed to govern for him: Boris Godunov, a minor nobleman of humble origins. When Fyodor died in 1598, Boris ensured that he had the backing of the church and the people of Moscow (through some clever manipulation) and was crowned tsar.

Dmitry, the son of Ivan the Terrible's third marriage, not yet of age on his father's death, was brought up in Uglich, far away from Moscow. He died in mysterious circumstances in 1591. The commission of investigation sent to Uglich and led by the powerful boyar Shuysky could establish only that the nine-year-old child, who suffered severely from epilepsy, had probably given himself a mortal wound with his toy dagger. Nonetheless, rumours circulated that Boris had ordered Dmitry's murder in order to get the throne for himself, and the hypothesis is mentioned in Nikolay Karamzin's multi-volume history of Russia, which appeared early in the nineteenth century and was an important historical source for both Pushkin and Musorgsky.

According to contemporary chronicles and other accounts, Boris was a very suitable incumbent of the throne, a good and ambitious tsar. With his many virtues as a ruler, he towered above the legitimate tsars who had preceded him. But the time and circumstances were against him. Early in 1600 a catastrophic drought caused terrible famine, fires raged in Moscow, and the peasants and the of the city rebelled.

At this point the Polish army crossed the western border intending to set a pretender on the throne -- a young man claiming to be Dmitry, the youngest son of Ivan the Terrible. In 1605 and in the middle of this crisis, Boris Godunov suddenly died. There were suspicions that he had been poisoned. The Polish army, with the False Dmitry at its head, entered Moscow. The Poles killed Boris Godunov's son Fyodor, the heir to the throne, and crowned their own ""Dmitry"" tsar. To seal the alliance between Poland and Russia he immediately married Marina, daughter of the Sandomierz commander Mniszek, who was one of his supporters.

In the following years - the ""time of troubles"" - three other tsars seized the Russian throne, one of them being Vasily Shuysky. Marina Mniszek, apparently no beauty in real life, married two of these tsars in succession after the murder of her first husband, the False Dmitry, and even had a child by the third. The opera seems accurate, at least, in dwelling on her desire to occupy the throne of Russia.

The first Boris was Ivan Melnikov, by special permission of the censor, since it was usually forbidden to represent members of the tsar's family on stage. However, it was Fyodor Shalyapin who made the character of the powerful yet troubled tsar internationally famous when he sang the part at the Paris premiere of Rimsky Korsakov's second version in 1908. His large-scale and emotionally theatrical performance determined the interpretation of the role for decades. In 1 952 Boris Christoff made a recording of the opera, conducted by lssay Dobrowen, in which he sang three of the bass parts: Tsar Boris, Varlaam, and Pimen. In the second half of the twentieth century, with the decline in the tradition of the great Slavonic bass, the brooding and thoughtful aspect of the character has taken precedence over Boris's stature as a great ruler. Although Musorgsky, a realist, depicted his heroes impartially, it is impossible to miss his sympathy for Boris, which is evident in the tsar's monologue and death scene.

A critic who attended the premiere accused Musorgsky of presenting the people as ""unruly, drunkards, oppressed, and desperate."" Nor was that all: he added that ""the composer also depicts them as completely stupid, superstitious, simple, and good for nothing."" It is true that the people who are commanded to break into hymns of praise (in the scenes outside the Novodevichiy Monastery, the Kremlin in Moscow, and St. Basil's Cathedral) do prove to be simple-minded and good for very little, while certain other characters, such as Varlaam and Missail, are unruly drunkards. All this is in both Pushkin's and Musorgsky's version of the story. Theirs was a realistic picture, whether the critics praised or blamed playwright or composer. Under the surface of the crowd's simple-minded passivity, elemental powers seethe. They are apparent in the scene outside St. Basil's Cathedral, and break into open rebellion in the forest near Kromy. The Russian people are not depicted in a sympathetic light in this scene, where they are about to lynch one man and hang two others. However, Mussorgsky did draw distinctions: the poor people of Moscow are described as the ""people"" (""narod""), while the rebels of Kromy are called ""vagabonds,"" meaning a rabble or mob (""brodyagi"").

Musorgsky also used several genuine folk songs, such as the mocking song in the forest near Kromy.
Another authentic folk song is the basis for the chorus in the coronation scene. Beethoven used the same theme in the second movement of his string quartet op. 59, no. 2 (dedicated to the Russian Prince Razumovsky). The melody was originally a Christmas carol, and was promoted to the status of a general hymn of praise in nineteenth-century Russian opera, also featuring in Anton Rubinstein's The Merchant Kalashnikov (1879), Tchaikovsky's --Mazeppa (1884), and Rimsky-Korsakov's The Tsar's Bride (1899).

The characteristic harmonies of Slavonic church music have also infiltrated Musorgsky's music (for instance in the scene in the Chudov Monastery, and in Boris's death scene). The chorus of blind pilgrims in the prologue combines the polyphony of Russian folk song with the style of Orthodox sacred music.
For many of the aforementioned reasons, and because of the fusion of Pushkin and Mussorgsky genius, Boris Godunov makes the most Russian opera.  Pushkin's texts were obviously used for other Russian operas, such as Eugene Onegin and the Dame of Pique by Tchaikovsky, yet although Tchaikovsky is a  Russian composer, he made a point of writing  in Western Romantic style,  while Mussorgsky with the Mighty Handful (which included Rimsky-korsakov) aimed to create a distinctively Russian opera and music, with no Western influence.  In fact, comparing music by Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky, the greatest Russian composers of the 19th century, one understands the rift between two movements.  Without a doubt, Boris Godunov is another expression of Russian nationalism, and serves as an illustration how this feeling,  currently considered politically incorrect while being another side of patriotism, can create immortal masterpieces, expressing the spirit of the nation in a most profound way.

Mussorgsky's musical mastery is phenomenal.  The music changes drastically from quintessential Mussorgsky, unconventional, sewn with folk songs and spirit,  full of chaos, piety, brutality, barbarity, disorder, vastness and somber grandeur to  the perfectly orderly court of Poland.  The scene with now fashionable Grigory and Western-European polished plush Polish court, crowned by a perfect Western Lady Marina Mniszech, opens with a Polonaise, reminding of its Polish origins and sounding somewhat like Chopin;  Tchaikovsky's Polonaise from Eugene Onegin (1868) is not far from this one.

The civility, order, Western-European coldness, self-control and duplicity as seen by a Russian eyes are so genially painted by Mussorgsky using  references to the French music - perhaps we hear Charles Gounod here, and some Verdi - the elegance of the dialog reminds strongly of a few of those in Don Carlos, for example, between Marquis de Posa and Princess Eboli; in fact, the whole scene opens somewhat similarly on how Scene 2 in Act II of Don Carlos does - with a highly elegant atmosphere of the Spanish court, with ladies singing and Princess Eboli starring with her famous Veil Song ((""Au palais des fes"" / ""Nel giardin del bello"").  Given the timeline of both operas, it could be no surprise, since Don Carlos was premiered in 1868, six years before Boris (Premiere in 1874).

Profound traditional Russian fear and mistrust to the West, so splendidly and hilariously depicted by Gogol in literature, is given to us by Pushkin's influence in the libretto here - while Grigory, who, despite his treachery, is still Russian in character, speaks passionately of love, the coldly calculating Polish noble lady is mocking this useless emotion; she is interested only in power and position, in her case, becoming a Tsaritsa.  I completely adore subtle ways  Mussorgsky uses to express his distaste for everything West, including Verdi - and he utilizing only music to do so; nowhere in the text any overtly negative statements towards anything foreign can be found.  What mastery of conveying the emotion!

Speaking of Verdi and Shakespeare, one cannot fail to notice parallels between Boris Godunov and Macbeth, the tormented conscience, the remorse, and finally, attacks of insanity. Although romanticized, these characters both express  another eternal dilemma of crime and punishment.

Another stunning discovery is the distinct sound of Stravinsky ""Le sacre du printemps"" and ""Oedipus Rex"" in the first half of the opera especially; it is ever more astonishing as Stravinsky never mentioned Mussorgsky as a source of his inspiration; he used to nominate Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov.  At a second thought, his secrecy is not that surprising - with all due respect and admiration, it is a known fact that he played such games and innuendos, concealing the truth and passing tales for reality.  Nonetheless, I was struck  by a revelation of how much material Stravinsky mined at this opera for his own creations.

This particular production is of paramount importance due to the following reasons:

1). The opera is sung by the best at a time ensemble AND by the all-Russian-speaking cast; there is no accent whatsoever with any of characters, and this is a huge advantage.

2).  All the characters sing from extraordinary (Boris) to very good (Grigory); I was amazed at the quality of their diction - I understood every word, and the trouble begins only with a choir where the words are blurred.  We must also remember that this performance takes place in 1978, at the height and weight of Iron Curtain, when contacts with the West were almost nonexistent; yet the operatic tradition and school remained strong enough to produce such quality of singing; no wonder that after the fall of USSR many Russian singers became primadonnas/uomos of opera houses worldwide.

3). This performance was done in Moscow at the pinnacle of USSR might;  the was probably unlimited budget for this production, something even Ponnelle could not dream about, maybe only Leni Riefenstahl could get the same bottomless barrel for her creations; it is simply GRANDIOSE.  Everything is authentic, including REAL mink collars on the costumes of Boris and boyars; I would not be surprised to learn that their magnificent robes studded with precious stones were taken from The Armoury (Oruzheynaya Palata) in Moscow.  No Mariinsky or Bolshoi performance today could compare.  Watching this is like watching  Moteveri's L'Orfeo in Mantua in Palazzo Ducale - although we do not have such a DVD, alas.

4). It gives an interesting insight into Bolshoi Theater atmosphere of those days;  the public is dressed very festively, and the only liberty a few men take is to show up without a tie; but there is none without a jacket. This is exactly how it was in those days, and no one would take his coat into the sala; somehow people knew that they should check their stuff into the coat check; it was, naturally, free.

The only disadvantage is that the quality of recording and sound is not up to today's standards;  subtitles cannot be turned off; the sound fades at times, and is markedly lower in the last act, so you'll need to adjust the volume.  But this is still a minor nuisance considering the past grandeur of this staging.
