7871007,5,6304429835,"Two boys, one Jewish and the other Gentile, run off on an adventure only to return to their village which has been destroyed by the Germans. No violent or brutal scenes this is one of the most powerful films I've ever watched about WW II. In watching the film and the reaction of the boys to the destroyed village, we understand how the hatred and violence of WW II and the destruction of Jews has changed Europe, and how the continent will never be the same.",1464393600,,459,4.348837209302325
7871008,1,6304429835,"Poor character development and an inferior script combine to make this film a big disappointment.  Quite boring.  The writer/s have no idea how to build a story.  Don't get nostolgic...Jewish characters are presented inaccurately and with distain [except for the Communist lover & other characters who reject their Jewish identity].

One of the worst films i've seen in a while.",1287878400,,378,5.25
7871009,5,6304429835,"An extraordinarily rare film-- a movie shot in the 1990s with a gorgeous cast of young people speaking Yiddish. To see Yiddish as a living language, to see unfurled in the glory of modern cinematography a world that might have been and might still be is a truly magical experience. The film itself is good, and the cinematography is excellent. There is one of the most tasteful and beautiful love scenes of recent memory. It is a story of life in an Eastern European shtetl. The movie follows several plots, the central one a friendship between two young boys-- Ivan and Abraham, one Jewish, one non-Jewish. This story is encircled by a series of romances between two beautiful young people (both speaking Yiddish!), and a middle-aged married couple (also very sweet). The movie has elements of fairy-tale like lyricism tempered by brutal reality (who could make a story about the shtetl without a pogrom?) Only one facet of the film is  an elegy. Mostly it sparkles a prayer of remembrance, a piece of art that gives testament to human kindness and endurance.",996105600,8,1060,4.824175824175824
