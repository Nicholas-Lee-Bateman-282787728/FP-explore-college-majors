6423688,1,B00KE7PC6Q,Dreadful movie despite a decent cast. Not even the usually reliable Susan Sarandon can breathe life into this by-the-numbers crime thriller that is completely devoid of thrills or suspense. Wait for this one to appear for free...which be should sooner than later. And don't believe you're seeing this before it gets a theatrical run. There's no chance in hell The Calling will get a theatrical release.,1406937600,9,402,5.106060606060606

6423728,2,B00KE7PC6Q,"Not a good movie. It was slow, It was not well put together. Neither Susan Sarandon, nor Donald Sutherland belonged in this movie. I replayed the last part of the movie four times, because I thought I had missed something that would resolve the mystery. It was never resolved. I feel like I was taken for my money, which is why I had recently cancelled my Prime subscription. After a year with Amazon Prime, I was not willing to pay $99.00 to keep it. I still had to pay extra for the better movies. I originally thought a Prime subscription was better than Netflix. Now, I'll stick to Youtube and
Redbox and pay to watch. maybe I'll consider a monthly subscription to Prime and decide each month if it is worth keeping.",1494547200,,720,4.462121212121212

6423746,1,B00KE7PC6Q,Great cast and taken from a compelling book. Good for 20 minutes until the plot  and characterization break down in TV cop show clich and the film becomes almost unwatchable. I hope the author of the book was well compensated..A supernatural element introduced at the end is hokey and totally out of character for a police procedural and belongs in another movie.,1473120000,,363,4.854838709677419

6423769,4,B00KE7PC6Q,"I think of this film as a sort of Canadian 'Silence of the Lambs', that is a story of a serial killer without the slick, knife-edged Hollywood cutting and editing.  While it is appropriately horrifying and really scary at  climactic intense moments, the storytelling has an attractively muted quality which goes with the context of small Canadian town and slightly shabby local law enforcement. It is lightly seasoned with Canadian accent, which is also nice. In the end, police chief Sarandon, ends up sending ( standing in for Clarisse Starling) an earnest and inexperienced young recruit into the jaws of the monster.  Sarandon's lieutenant is shouting into the phone, 'Wait for backup!' while Sarandon is insisting, 'We've gotta get this guy now..."" And the sweet young policeman says, ' I going in...'
Yeah, right. I'm going to the fridge for a snack.",1444521600,5,856,5.014084507042254

Then I get it - there are so many nuances and personality traits I like to understand.  This movie is intelligent, and has a cast that is first class in every way.  The plot and twists kept my attention and the second time I watched it I realized how the characters interacted, with Susan Sarandon and Ellen Burstyn showing the closest relationship in the whole movie.

I just wanted to yell at Sarandon's character to get excited about the horrible crimes being committed, but booze and pills will dull your responses.  She played that so well!

6423775,5,B00KE7PC6Q,"I enjoyed this movie. Detective Inspector Hazel Micallef (Susan Sarandon) moved slow, bad back and drank but her mind was quick. Reminds me of Jesse Stone (Tom Selleck)",1440547200,,168,5.035714285714286
6423776,3,B00KE7PC6Q,"From the vast number of crime novels and films like the film under review, The Calling, centered on serial killers you would think that (1) this wicked old world is a much more misogynous place that it really is and, (2) that it would be hard to come up with a new plotline to provide a rationale for the killers motives and for the inevitable hand of law enforcement (after some scares of course) to bring the miscreant to justice (or at least out of harms way, ours). So what the makers of this film have done is to go back that old tried and true plot producer, the Bible, to grab odd-ball motivation.

Heres how it plays out. A Podunk town pill-popping, too many pill-poppings if anybody is asking, chief police officer (played by Susan Sarandon), this time said Podunk town being in Canada just to show that serial killers know no borders when they get their blood lusts up, or whatever drives them to homicidal impulses, finds a body of a town resident gruesomely and apparently randomly murdered. Random until other murders showing some of the same kinds of patterns keep popping up in the area and beyond. After much investigation the pattern becomes clear-the killings are related and the killer whether, as the psychological profiles for serial killers go, is looking to be caught or not, has a message that he (or she) wants an indifferent world to hear about. Wants the world to feel his (or her) pain. As it turns out from the clues this killer has some religious motivation, big time religious motivation taking on the concept of the Christian version of resurrection.

Of course if you are in Canada trying to solve what looks like some archaic ritual religious murders (or anywhere else for that matter) then checking into some clerical expertise makes sense. So the good chief checks in with a bible scholar (played by Donald Sutherland) who spins a tale about lost off-the-wall ancient sects who believed that a series of signs could bring the dead back, or rather one dead person back-replicating the Christian experience-a version of the second coming. Like I said the good priest spins a nice tale because he is into the whole scheme up to his eyeballs. Seems that one of his old-time orphanage charges is out to avenge his brothers suicide committed in adulthood after having been farmed out as a child to some sexual pervert and is using the biblical playbook provide by the good priest to bring him back.

Not going to happen right, no way but as the plot thickened things looked very dicey. The serial killer does come very close but no the dear chief will survive to grab a fistful of pills and some well-deserved kudos another day. Like I say times are tough finding new plotlines for fictional serial killers. This one only worked so-so.",1440547200,,2765,4.685185185185185

6423795,4,B00KE7PC6Q,"The Calling is a pretty awesome suspense, but the ending could've been better I think.  The plot builds in such a splendid and ominous way that it deserved a more fulfilling ending.  That's the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars.  Susan Sarandon plays the role of a woman who obviously had a troubled past- she was either someone who relied heavily on medication based on the very first scene where she's lying on her bedroom floor struggling to stand up, and perhaps she was an alcoholic too.  Her history was never discussed in detail so we can only guess.  She's not someone I usually look forward to in movies, but in this particular role she's really good.  While everyone else is apparently familiar with her history, she surprises everyone by revealing she's actually a very responsible cop and does intelligent research pertaining to her investigative work solving a string of murders around town.

Topher Grace playing the role of a cop is somewhat hilarious to me.  You see I still remember him as Eric from his famous That 70's Show years, so it's hard to take him seriously as a police officer.  Even when needles are getting injected into his neck and he's putting his life on the line, I'm waiting for a punch line or for him to reveal some kind of elaborate or sarcastic prank is occurring.  He even acts the same way in this movie with his stone-faced facial expressions.  Clearly the wrong guy for the role!  Anyway he's definitely a good actor- it's just me who has to adjust to well, the fact that That 70's Show has been off the air for 7 years now and I need to get with the times for one thing, but also that he's trying to take himself seriously as an actor in a suspenseful movie.  I still have trouble making that adjustment.

Anyway I'm rambling needless crap.  I didn't have a good day today.  I enjoyed this movie but soon after I got really tired and needed to take a nap.  I'm not feeling 100% today.  Perhaps I stayed up too late last night listening to Al Di Meola, lol.  I didn't realize it at first but the gloomy setting of this movie matched the damp and cloudy setting outside my window while watching it.  It was an ideal setting!

Did I even get to the story yet?  It's about a religious fanatic played by Christopher Heyerdahl who goes to great lengths to kill victims since he believes doing so will bring his brother back.  I'm sure it's more elaborate than that, but hey, religion can be a *very* difficult subject to follow for me since I'm not familiar with the subject.  This movie usually avoids being confusing thankfully, but every so often the story can be tricky to follow.  There's clearly a lot of religion talk taking place however.  Donald Sutherland playing the role of a priest is a surprise.  He's very good at it.  I've never noticed any similarities between him and his son Keifer until now- I can finally tell they are in fact father and son while watching Donald's facial expressions and body movements.

Overall this movie succeeds at telling a fairly easy to follow story without resorting to heavy religious talk that can often times confuse viewers, Susan's character is really good, the actor who plays her mother is really good too (she likes to reminisce a lot and wishes her daughter Susan would loosen up and smile like she used to, obviously an indication that Susan takes her job too seriously and that something happened in her past).  Christopher Heyerdahl is the best actor in the film easily however, because he's VERY good at being conniving.  I was seriously baffled for a while because he looked more like a saint rather than a sinner.  Like someone coming along to brighten people's day.  I was shocked at the sudden change his character partook in, and what he did to a sick little girl.

But yeah, Topher Grace is out of place being a police officer.  I like the scene when he discovered dead bodies in a home.  He got sick which was a normal reaction, but he didn't express as much shock as a person is supposed to (police officer or not).  Also admired the way he and Susan would work together trying to figure out how the murderer functions by sorting through words on a chalkboard concerning the lip movements of the victims. Turns out Topher was way off with his logic!

The suspense factor is really high, the setting is terrific taking place in a small town where nothing out of the ordinary has happened until this recent string of murders, and the acting is terrific all around.  Highly recommended.",1428969600,,4494,4.563046192259676
6423796,4,B00KE7PC6Q,"I cannot stand Susan Sarandon or her P.C. liberal politics. That being said, I bought this movie based on a preview of it on another DVD. I was not disappointed.

I love the way the story evolves and how we follow these characters, yes, even the bad guy through all the paces. Bravo for all the performances and the story and the direction. since it is a mystery of sorts, I won't say much more except we even have a very fine support cast. Why 4 stars instead of 5?

All of the characters are essential parts of this story.  No wasted time.  No eye-rolling ""surprises.""  This is a well-done movie about a sicko serial killer whose motives make sense and mirror what many religious people believe today.  His personal need is understandable but terrible.  And he is played by a phenomenal actor.  As is his nemesis (Susan Sarandon) and her crew.  You will care about each of the good guys, which makes a few scenes very suspenseful.

6423932,3,B00KE7PC6Q,"Susan Sarandon is the broken-down, moderately corrupt, alcoholic sheriff of a small, snowy Canadian town.  She is suddenly faced with a grotesque murder of a life-long friend of hers, and, then, she is called in to another murder of a victim completely dissimilar to the first victim, except for the strange distortion of the face. Clearly, she concludes, there is a serial killer afoot, notwithstanding the fact that her supervisor attempts to dissuade her by telling her that serial killers want to advertise their killers.

Because, obviously, cops and serial killers read from the same ""Serial Killing for Dummies"" handbook.

The mystery is mediocre but nonetheless workable.  The trail is followed sensibly. Clues are acquired without much deus ex machina.  Red herrings are dragged across the trail. There is a conclusion, albeit there is also an open-ended facet to the conclusion, which is provided for final shock value, albeit I was not very intrigued by it.

For me, however, a major drawback was the absurd use of the Catholic Church to provide the mystery element.  It seems that there is a Catholic tradition - or an early Christian tradition existing before the Vatican but known to Catholics - of a ""prayer of resurrection,"" which, if said by twelve people who are sacrificed will resurrect one dead person.

Okey-dokey.

Forget the whole, you know, Christian notion of Christ's sacrifice supposedly being sufficient by itself, we get this bizarre, made up out of cloth nonsense, and then it is ascribed to the Catholic Church, consisting of 1.2 billion people, including 25% of the population of Canada and the United States as if it is the most natural thing in the world.  At which point, 25% of the population must be going ""WTF?"" and the 75% must be saying ""Silly Catholics and their crazy superstitions.""

Why not ascribe this crazy serial killer and his crazy belief to some unidentified fundamentalist sect?  Then the viewer might be willing to suspend their disbelief about this crazy belief having some traction among that group.  Heaven knows that history has given the world more than sufficient crazy splinter groups with crazy ideas, but to treat the Catholic Church as if it was a community of 100 inbred, non-literate fanatics living in the wilds of Manitoba is a bit of a stretch, and more than a bit unnecessary in its insults.

You have to wonder if anyone involved in the film knew any Catholics.  There is a sense that the filmmakers were discussing a headhunter tribe in Borneo and not the single largest church in America and Canada. Thus, characters have an arch bit of condescension for religion, and, although the main character is supposedly Catholic, she treats her own church as if it was a bizarre cult. This gets translated into clunker lines like a nun talking about a ""Sunday Service.""  Excuse me, but ""service""? Protestants have ""services""; Catholics have ""masses.""

As a Catholic, this kind of thing just gets old to me. I understand that filmmakers are looking for instant credibility for their product, but is it impossible for them to do even a little research?",1413590400,3,3115,4.959615384615384

Detective Hazel Micallef , played by Susan Sarandon polices the sleepy town of Fort Dundas. The small Canadian town doesnt need much police work, and so the fact that the back pain and alcoholism doesnt impact her day job much. Ray Green, played by Gil Bellows, is second in command. Into the mix comes officer Ben Wingate, played by Topher Grace, the only one beside Hazel who has much get up and go. And, on this day, an elderly lady neighbor of Hazels is found dead under very suspicious circumstances. Two days later another death. This small town has a reckoning, and Hazel goes to work. Of note, Hazel's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn, a retired judge, seems smart and together with not much to do. Such a fine cast, such a poorly written and directed film.

I tried to like it, and I did in parts, but on the whole thumbs down, all two of them. This was a film that went straight to DVD.

It was complicated and had depth, which is very rare for a female role.  Usually, Woody Allen is the only writer/director who does a good female role.  Not only was she complicated, but she was over  30.  Very impressive.  In fact, if you made the character's mother more exaggerated, a man could have slid right into that role.  These characters were very real.

The one thing that keeps it from being a movie I want to see over and over again was it's pace.  It walked where other serial killer movies run.  It needed a pinch more suspense.",1411862400,3,653,4.4491525423728815
6423960,4,B00KE7PC6Q,"At first you might think this is going to be a dreary rip-off of Fargo. We have Susan Sarandon as small town Chief of Police in place of Frances McDormand, and shes in Ontario instead of North Dakota. But as she sets off through the cold to investigate the grisly murder, in her thick jacket and earmuffs, she definitely recalls McDormands figure. But she doesnt have the appeal of McDormands Fargo character. Sarandon is lumbered with portraying an acid-tongued alcoholic here, someone the viewer is inclined not to care much about or want to follow.

But a few more sympathetic characters turn up to capture our interest. One is a young policeman transferred from Toronto. The other is, surprisingly enough, the serial killer himself. While this killer poses his victims in the unrealistic, elaborate ways of a CSI episode, he is unique in other ways. He has a soft sincerity that is likely to seduce, to hypnotize viewers into wanting to lend themselves to his plan.

A kind of unexpected humanity emerges in the course of the police pursuit of the killer. Even Susan Sarandons character becomes almost likeable along the way.",1411862400,8,1129,4.875

6423972,4,B00KE7PC6Q,"The Calling is a smart little Canadian thriller based upon the novel of the same name and featuring a stellar cast which includes Susan Sarandon, Gil Bellows, Ellen Burstyn, Topher Grace, Donald Sutherland, and Christopher Heyerdahl.  Sarandon plays Hazel Micallef, a police inspector in the rural Canadian town of Fort Dundas.  The tiny community is rocked by the grisly murder of an elderly resident.  A second murder in a neighboring community leads Hazel and her partner Ray (Bellows) to believe the murders are connected.  Both bodies were found with their mouths frozen as if screaming or talking.  Young detective Ben Wingate (Grace) transfers to Fort Dundas from Toronto and discovers a string of murders have taken place across all of Canada, each with the same circumstances.

In playing the victims photos in slideshow sequence they discover that each victim was uttering a different syllable of a Latin phrase.  Hazel consults with linguistics expert Father Price (Sutherland) who tells her the phrase is an ancient prayer of resurrection that required a dozen willing sacrifices to bring the intended person back from the dead.  The detectives race to try and stop the killer before he can reach his final victim.

The Calling can be cracked on the knuckles for having some significant plot holes and unanswered questions but its easy to overlook its imperfections with a sterling cast that propels this thriller from the opening scene.  Weve seen the alcoholic cop routine a million times in other films but rarely with a female cop.  Sarandon plays her character as flawed as possible but shes propped up by those that care for her including mother Emily played by Ellen Burstyn who is enjoying a career rebirth at the age of 82.  Quirky Donald Sutherland, celebrating 50 years in film, always manages to elevate any film in which he stars.  But perhaps the best performance comes from Christopher Heyerdahl.  Heyerdahl has made a career out of playing sinister and creepy characters in both films and TV including appearances in Supernatural, Hell on Wheels, True Blood, and the Twilight film series.  Once again Heyerdahl steps in with a truly menacing and oddball character.  The Calling doesnt break any new ground in the thriller genre but its a textbook example of how to do one right.",1411776000,3,2306,5.028947368421052

However, the 'shock' is not as shocking as it could have been, and suffice it to say that there was an entire twist that could have made this a five-star movie that I guess no one else considered (it's how I would have written the ending). Still, phenomenal movie, and definitely worth the time.",1410652800,6,537,4.489795918367347

Fantastic to see a strong woman having the lead in a crime drama/thriller.  Topher Grace surprised me with his nuanced performance, I had only previously seen him in ""fun"" films, so his serious role here was a switch.  He pulled it off with a lot of skill, had me drawn in to find out his character's motivations and fate.

6424011,4,B00KE7PC6Q,"Inger Ash Wolfe's novel by the same name has been transformed into a screenplay by Scott Abramovitch and directed by Jason Stone and acted by an excellent cast. The problem with the film as with the book is that it is more an examination of religious myths and beliefs than a murder mystery and keeping the tow parallel stories aligned hampers the end result.

In a small wintry town close to the Canadian border Hazel Metcalf (Susan Sarandon) is the alcoholic Detective Inspector still recovering from a suicide attempt and held under tight control by her immediate adjunct Detective Ray Green (Gil Bellows). A new detective is sent in to help - Ben Wingate (Topher Grace)  - who is smarter than his youth would suggest. Hazel couples analgesics with alcohol to diminish her back pain but still manages to stay on top of the law in the little town where she practices. Her supportive mother (Ellen Burstyn) is her only backup system and that relationship is strained. A series of murders begins to unfold, all tied together with oral manipulation of the corpse to form a Latin saying. There is a stranger in town, a gentle, bearded man named Simon (Christopher Heyerdahl) who is well known to the local priest Father Price (Donald Sutherland); the priest had to chose between two orphan boys when they were young an done died. Simon is the survivor and we begin to understand the religious secret that asks for twelve people to willingly die so that one dead soul can be resurrected.  Enough said.

The story is dark, the theme somewhat unbelievable, but if you give in to the magic of the ritual that is perpetrating the serial killings the film makes a rather solid statement (until the last imagery...). Sarandon, Sutherland and Burstyn save the day with quality acting. Grady Harp, September 14",1409875200,15,1799,4.7935483870967746

6424033,4,B00KE7PC6Q,"A thriller for people over 40 -- how rad is that! Marvelous twists plus brilliant acting from three American movie legends kept me guessing. Great story. The logic of the ritual --with its alleged origins among the Apostles-- is bound to shock both atheists and religionists. Is it *How could you be so stoopid?* or *How could you have so much faith?* While there was plenty of graphic death going on, how effing refreshing it was to not be engulfed by gore and useless violence... for a change. Getting the chance to see Donald Sutherland and Susan Sarandon and Ellen Burstyn is a thrill of another sort. Topher Grace plays a fully drawn character this time, and wasn't allowed by the clever director to simply pimp his Topher Graceness, as so often happens. Then, I could say from experience, the everyday small town sheriff's office [Canadian, semi-rural, so it's not overrun by mafia and gangbangers yet] was funny and deep, full of old resentments and little everyday annoyances, and the too-flirty receptionist. Everything that goes on here is believable. The best thriller-horror films always rate high on the believability of the everyday walking-around reality. For those who argue it isn't horror, and deny any supernatural element, take another look at what happens in one of the cures.",1409011200,28,1297,4.981566820276497
