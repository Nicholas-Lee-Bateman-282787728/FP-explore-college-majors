7975253,2,B00007AJDZ,"This video tells a story of the Island of Ibiza vai some chill out tunes. If you're into the sounds of Ian Van Dahl, DJ Armin Van Buren, DJ Tiesto, Kate Ryan and other Euro sounds of a similar variety, this DVD isn't for you.  If you were looking for a video that describes the tourism of the Island this isn't for you either. It's a chill out trippy video that functions great as a back drop to a home or workspace while you're doing something else. This sound has more of a chill out, almost trippy sound to it with pictures. It's okay for the VJ scene but not something similar to the stuff put out by Moonshine. After watching this I was not impressed and would not recommend buying this DVD, but it was an okay rent if you're looking for some of the scenes. It does add to the mystery of this island. If you're an American consider Ibiza (pronounced Ibetha) the South Padre Island or Myrtle Beach of Spain with a bit more of a clubber's flair (Think Vegas with out the gambling). It's very classiy. Lots of young people there. There is a freak show, people watching element to many of the things there kind of like a Bourbon Street in New Orleans or the Carnival in Rio. This is an amazing place if you're interested in going. It is all abou the clubs, clubbing and beautiful people.",1150329600,2,1288,4.300411522633745
7975254,1,B00007AJDZ,"this was a very poor poor experience. and it was worth the low rating. ultra repetitive scenes, nauseating insipid scenes of people sleeping on the beach, and wow we get to see the same scenes but in a different video effect. let the music do the looping, don't loop the same images. in fact, never do that again. or do a entire video on people bumming on the beach. need people talking, what r the stores like down there, culture? ive never been.",1134432000,2,447,4.397590361445783
7975255,2,B00007AJDZ,"If you have yet to go to Ibiza you might find this DVD slightly entertaining... assuming you like pixelated 1970's effects applied to stock party footage, mixed with footage of people looking bored as they eat or sleep. In my opinion it is a dis-service to the most magic place on this earth. A place full of diverse and wonderful people, music, and scenery - something this dvd fails to convey. The most frustrating and surprising thing about this DVD is that begining to end the footage is destroyed by the most horrble and garish color ""effect"" that also manages to ruin the image quality. I honestly thought my DVD player was not playing it properly, so I tried it on a friends which produced the same results. The music would have been great about 10 years ago but does the modern/current sound of Ibiza no justice. It should be retitled Ibiza Vs. Atari. Unfortunatly Atari wins...
And another thing, it was so dissapointing that when I go back next summer I'm taking a video camera. Look for my DVD next year.
As an artist I have to give props to the package design, the only reason I gave it 2 stars...
E-mail me if ya want info on Ibiza, it really is an amazing place. (current e-mail can be found at my personal site digitalcrafter.com)",1066262400,,1245,4.513274336283186
