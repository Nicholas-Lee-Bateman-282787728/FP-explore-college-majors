7306980,4,B010BCBHH6,"Intercontinental Champion Ryback vs. Kevin Owens - Ryback was in control with his power early on before Owens was able to single out a specific body part & heavily work it over throughout the matches using various areas of the ring along with offense from stretch submissions to strikes & moves hybrid together to directly effect that part of the body to the point where Ryback showed effects executing attempting his power offense & signature moveset in what was a good opening match that was all about telling a story of working over a body part.

Dolph Ziggler vs. Rusev - Dolph debuted new ring gear while Summer Rae was wearing the earrings Dolph gave her previously as both men started brawling right away before Rusev was able to gain control using the ringside environment to work over an area of the body along with his strength & weight advantage while Dolph was able to use Rusev's momentum against him & hit quick moves as they continued to trade momentum throughout the rest of the contest in a solid match that came down to everyone questioning weather the actions at the end were intended for the effects it had.

WWE Tag Team Champions The New Day vs. Dudley Boyz - The Dudleys returned to WWE after SummerSlam to capture their 10th tag team championship in WWE as Kofi started out disrespecting Devon & later Big E doing the same to Bubba which only fired them up taking control in dominate fashion with impactful offense & double team maneuvers before the New Day took control using whatever they could from their numbers advantage to using their individual strengths & double teaming in their own entertaining way in a good match with the only thing negative I can say was the result depending on how you want to look at it.

Divas Champion Nikki Bella vs. Charlotte - Nikki broke the record for the longest reigning Divas Champion (another story for another time) earlier in the week through tactics that caused this match to be where she lost her champions advantage by being able to lose the title on a disqualification or count out.  Charlotte had the early advantage before Nikki was able to take advantage of an opening working over her knee relentlessly using the environment around her from the bottom ring rope to ring post while using Charlotte's & her own weight along with submissions in what was without a doubt the best performance from Nikki Bella as champion being a dominate heel here & telling the story of being completely ruthless in working over an area of the body but also conscience of not trying to get unintentionally disqualified.

Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, Chris Jericho vs. The Wyatt Family - It should be noted since this would be edited out that another incident similar to the past couple of weeks happened where a fan jumped the rail attempting to be the partner for the former Shield members only for the real partner to be revealed as Chris Jericho.  Jericho & Reigns & Ambrose were in control early before Braun Stroman stopped their momentum dead easily overpowering everyone & tossing them around as both teams traded momentum Stroman giving the advantage back to his team singling out one member in their half of the ring working him over both in the ring legally & outside illegally while still overpowering them including dumping one opponent into the front row only for the ex-Shield & Jericho to finally gain momentum using a series of non-stop offense getting the advantage over Stroman in what was a good six man tag that did it's job in establishing Stroman as a monster & reestablishing the Wyatts as a very dangerous group since before their breakup.

United States Champion Seth Rollins vs. John Cena - The first of two back to back scheduled title defenses for Seth Rollins as Cena started off brawling aggressively before Seth took control with some aerial offense but being distracted ""directing"" the crowd & mocking Cena which opened the door for Cena to take advantage including using various counters showcasing an array of new & rarely seen moves from him as they traded momentum throughout the contest including doing each other's moves & each man going aerial at some point in what was a step below the SummerSlam match but still another really good match in their series.

WWE Champion Seth Rollins vs. Sting - Seth's own attitude & actions after his previous match caused Cena to react in a way that left him at even more of a disadvantage coming into this encounter with Sting capitalizing right away both in & outside of the ring until Seth was able to catch a break & realize that he had Sting where he wanted him heavily working over an area of Sting's body with Sting coming back including taking some high risk moves to the outside before one impactful move directly to that area caused Sting intense pain that he tried to fight through but was clear that he was seriously injured in what was definitely Sting's best performance dating back to the last year of his run in TNA with the bigger story being the aftermath of one man following up on his guarantee to follow up on this opportunity while another came for unfinished business.

(Kickoff Match) Neville & Lucha Dragons vs. Stardust & The Ascension - Neville & The Dragons relied on their various aerial offense both in the ring & going to the outside while Stardust & Ascension relied on their power advantage to single out one opponent in their corner using frequent tags in a basic back & forth encounter.

This was a solid show which didn't have any bad matches but endings that could be either good or bad depending on how you want to look at it however things in particular standing out was the high amount of matches that focused on telling an in-ring story of working over a specific part of the body that I honestly can't remember from an WWE event in recent history along with Seth Rollins having two back to back matches for close to 45 minutes so it's something I would check out.",1443916800,4,5936,4.6772030651340994
7306981,4,B010BCBHH6,"The Intercontinental Championship match between Ryback & Kevin Owens was a solid match with Owens working over the arm all match long, which played into the finish with Ryback being unable to lift him up to hit Shellshock. They didn't have a lot of great nearfalls, but there were a few decent moments. Thats the end of Rybacks IC Title reign, which was pretty forgettable. It wasn't Ezekiel Jackson-like bad, but it wasn't something people are going to remember for a long time. It was the right time for the title change and Owens is the right guy to win it. The Dolph Ziggler-Rusev match was a really good power wrestler vs. speed wrestler type of match. Thats what they're both good at it. They really picked up the pace in the last five minutes with all of the believable nearfalls and the crowd got into it a lot. Zigglers offense is great. Rusevs power moves are outstanding. Im a huge fan of both guys. I know I mentioned a few times that moves didn't look great. Its not that big of a deal. That just happens sometimes when they're not showing the right camera or the spot is off a bit. As for the booking, that was the right finish since the whole thing started months ago because Rusev injured Ziggler. This is the babyface payback for Ziggler. Its also a way to end the storyline with Rusev blaming Summer for costing him the match. The WWE Tag Team Championship match between The New Days Big E & Kofi Kingston against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray & Devon) was a predictable match and finish, but thats not a bad thing. Both teams worked hard, they set up the spots well, there were some fun moments and that finish was the right thing to do. The feud just started with New Day winning back the Tag Team Titles last month, so theres no need to rush a title change. Build it up some more. They can do a match with a stipulation down the road. The Divas Championship match between Nikki Bella & Charlotte was a good match with some smart psychology with Nikki working over the leg for nearly the entire match. I just thought the ending could have been better because it only took a couple of moves to beat Nikki. They should have done a spot where Charlotte wasn't able to apply the Figure Eight to sell the pain of her leg. When a wrestler is selling moves, they should sell on defense and even on offense too. It also hurt Nikki to tap out so quickly. Have Charlotte apply it once, Nikki gets to the ropes, then Charlotte does it again and thats how it should have ended. Those aren't major gripes, though. They worked hard and I thought it was a well built match. I just think they could have built up some nearfalls more to make it a more exciting finish. The Six Man Tag Team match between The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper & Braun Strowman) against Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose & Chris Jericho was a pretty intense match with a hot crowd that was excited to see Jericho there. The big story of the match was that the faces had the momentum when Jericho tagged in and thats the mistake because Reigns was in full control. It can keep the Reigns feud with Wyatt going because it wasn't Reigns that was pinned in this match. I admit my foolishness in thinking The Wyatt Family might lose this match. My initial thought was that WWE made such a big deal out of the mystery partner and normally the mystery performer gets the win. However, its so early in Braun Strowmans career that it would have been the wrong move to have him get pinned. The United States Championship match Seth Rollins & John Cena was a great match just like they always have. The year has been loaded with epic matches, so I wouldnt call it a match of the year contender. It was still great, though. Im not sure how many of their matches Ive reviewed, but this was at the same level if not better than their other matches. The outcome didn't surprise me at all because Rollins already has the WWE Title, so why keep the US Title on him long term? Plus, apparently WWE ordered a new batch of Cena US Title shirts, which is another reason why the title change was obvious. Im so impressed with Rollins every time he gets the chance to have a long match like this. Cenas had a very good year too, but Rollins makes everything look so easy. Im looking forward to the return of the Cena US Open Challenge because it was a highlight on Raw for much of the year. The World Heavyweight Championship match between Seth Rollins & Sting was a very good match that was entertaining the whole way although the Sting injury was a bit scary. Stings injury was apparently legitimate and to his neck, but as of Monday we don't know the severity of it. The Buckle Bomb spot by Rollins looks cool although theres a chance that it could hurt somebody just because of the force of being driven into the turnbuckle. Plus, with Sting in his 50s hes more susceptible to injuries. Hopefully hes okay. Anyway, as a match it was a lot of fun. I loved the story of Rollins possibly being tired after having the other match before this one, so it added to the intrigue of this match. I didn't think Sting would win. Im glad he didnt. His age is a major reason why. Rollins winning clean is better than most of his wins, so Im cool with the rollup ending. It also may have been improvised if Sting was legitimately hurt. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1443312000,5,5311,4.354838709677419

8721734,3,B010BCBHH6,its was a pretty decent show the opening match against Kevin Owens and Ryback was bad they have bad chemistry in my opinion. 4.5 /10as much as I like Kevin Owens I did not enjoy this match. Dolph Ziggler and Rusev's match was ok but their match at Summerslam was better 6/10. The tag title match was ok could have been better but still good accept for the BS ending with a disqualification 5.5/10.the divas title match was the worst match of the night their match at hell in a cell was so much better but congrats to the winner but still one of the worst ppv matches of the year 3/10.next a great match between Chris Jericho and Roman Reigns and Dean Ambrose vs the Wyatt Family it was fast paced action and I really liked it with 5 great wrestlers not including Brawn Strowman 8/10 great stuff here. Next up the United States title match between John Cena and my favorite wrestler on the roster Seth Rollins and this was the match of the night no doubt great counters and really good chemistry in their matches and this did not beg to differ. They have had so many great matches their Smackdown match their raw matches and their ppv matches different stuff from these two each time they face off. So great I have to give it a 9/10. Since this is Night Of Champions Seth Rollins right after had to face Sting in a match for the World Heavyweight championship. This was a disappointment and this ended up to be Sting's last match and it was ok Sting suffered a injury Halfway through the match and it went slow from their on ok a 5/10. Overall it was an ok show that had in my opinion a total of 3 out of 5 stars.,1463270400,,1612,4.254071661237785

NIGHT OF CHAMPIONS 2015

Spoilers

I was looking forward to this event so much when it was first announced. Sting was getting that title shot against Rollins and although we all knew Rollins would keep it there was still that little doubt. The event turned out to be a real fun one with a sad ending with what happened to Sting. Still a good event that I would recommend.

1. STARDUST & THE ASCENTION VS THE LUCHA DRAGONS & NEVILLE-good opening contest that gets the crowd pumped up. The Dragons and Neville fly all over the place but it isn't enough to keep the stronger team down. Stardust uses his own teammate to get the win in a good back and forth opener.

2.[I-C TITLE]RYBACK VS KEVIN OWENS-I am a huge Owens fan so I was looking forward to this match. Although I will say that I was happy Ryback had a little push and got the title. Still I was rooting for Owens. This was a good match that had to powerful guys going at it. I like that Owens was old school heel here and used that rake to get the win and the title.

3. DOLPH ZIGGLER VS RUSEV-another good match with another favorite of mine, Ziggler. Great back and forth here with Summer Rae on the outside. Rusev is the bigger stronger guy but Ziggler holds his own the entire time. In the end Rae hits Rusev with her shoe costing her guy the match, Ziggler gets the win.

4.[TAG TITLE]THE NEW DAY VS THE DUDLEY BOYZ-the most entertaining guys in the WWE are the tag champs, the New Day. I absolutely LOVE these guys, best thing in WWE by far. I also love them Dudleys so this was a hard one to watch. This of course was one of the main reasons I was watching this event, highly anticipated for me. This was a great match with both teams looking great. It would end in a DQ after Woods keeps them from losing the belts after Kofi took a 3-D. they would put Woods threw a table afterwards for his troubles.

5.[DIVAS TITLE]NIKKI BELLA VS CHARLOTTE-I badly wanted Bella to lose the title here. I thought it was crap that they had her beat AJs record for holding the title. Now I knew Charlotte was going to be great but Bella did well here as well, she has gotten better over the years. Good match that would see the young Flair win her first Divas title with the figure 8, thankfully.

6. THE WYATT FAMILY VD CHRIS JERICHO, DEAN AMBROSE, & ROMSN REIGNS-if the New Day aren't the best thing the WWE has it is without  doubt Bray Wyatt. Another match I was very much looking forward to. Great action in this one as the pace is fast and it goes everywhere. This one would end with The Wyatts getting the win after Y2J gets put to sleep.

7.[US TITLE]SETH ROLLINS VS JOHN CENA-these two always have a good match and this was just like those previous. Rollins is great and Cena really stepped up once he had won the US title prior to Rollins taking it from him. This was a great back and forth match and Rollinss first of two back to back. Both looked great here with Cena once again winning the US title.

8.[WWE TITLE]SETH ROLLINS VS STING-great match and another I was looking forward to. I knew that Rollins was going to retain but I didn't think Sting was going to get seriously injured. Prior to that this was a really good match and highly entertaining. But after that second powerbomb into the corner you could tell Sting was really hurt. Sting of course continued the match but not too long after he was rolled up for Rollins to retain. Afterwards Sheamus tries to cash in only for Kane to chokeslam both Rollins and Sheamus.
