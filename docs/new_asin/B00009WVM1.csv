1895212,5,B00009WVM1,"I'm not a Sherlock Holmes fan.  I watched this DVD solely because it was produced by the BBC.  What a surprise it turned out to be!

The DVD provides background information Doyle and how he became the writer of the Holmes novels.

The acting is superb, the filming remarkable, and the viewer really feels like he/she is in Victorian England.

Another reviewer says that this isn't the only episode and one can only hope that the others will become available in the US.",1120348800,8,468,4.590361445783133
1895213,5,B00009WVM1,"This is not a Sherlock Holmes movie, but it is a top-pick for any Sherlock Holmes fan. In fact, I would go as far as saying it is the best Sherlock Holmes movie I ever saw, even though Holmes is hardly mentioned.

Basically, the movie shows the early life of A.C. Doyle, the author of Sherlock Holmes, who apparently met a professor at the university that inspired him to write his novels. This movie shows a case Doyle and Dr. Bell solved and clearly, it is a story one could describe as a ""best of Sherlock Holmes"". Apparently it is based on fact. Whether that is true or not, I do not know.

This movie represents what I like best about Sherlock Holmes and it in many way is what I wanted other Sherlock Holmes movies to be.",1114992000,5,727,4.260869565217392

The MOVIE- My biggest complaint is that they haven't released the rest.  If you like mysteries in general, or Sherlock Holmes specifically, then you'll find Dr. Bell & Mr. Doyle a great little film.  I found the whole premise of the origins of the idea of the Holmes character to be great plot.  The acting is wonderful.

Although this subsequent effort doesn't provide Richardson with as delightfully colorful a role, it's quite interesting in its own right.

The film -- which is directed by Paul Seed, who helmed the first two ""House of Card"" installments -- takes the facts of Arthur Conan Doyle's early life and adds a bit of conjecture to forge a convincing mystery. It's very well done, and the viewer is expertly manipulated into jumping to wrong conclusions in order to stay surprised at the end.

What gives the film added depth is the sense of period it gives, as well as the historical perspective on forensic investigation. And Doyle fans will enjoy seeing the parallels between Dr. Bell and Sherlock Holmes.

Anyone with an interest in any of the above will find this DVD worth getting.",1071964800,20,1123,5.962732919254658
1895217,5,B00009WVM1,"Aurthur Conan Doyle, the author who ""created"" Sherlocke Holmes was a Scotsman who studied at the Medical College in Edinburgh in the late 19th Century, and became a physician in real life (was he Watson?). Ian Richardson plays a top professor at the college. Some speculate that the Richardson character was the basis for Sherlock Holmes.
The professor (Richardson) is called to help the police when foul play is suspected in a murder investigation. Several good tales are told in this series involving the death of a woman student at the medical college, the betrayal of a married woman, and seances with a medium.
I found the tales as fascinating if not more fascinating than the ""original"" Holmes tales because they provide some insight into the forensics of the period. This forensic detail is much more than you'd find in a Holmes story...but just what would have been available in 19th Century Scotland when people were beginning to think about the application of science to crime solving.
Several interesting actors populate the stories including Richardson who starred in the trilogy ""to play the king...the final cut"" about the Prime Minister of the UK.",1064620800,73,1162,5.025906735751295

Bell uses much of Sherlock Holmes deductive logic to solve mysteries for the police, and we are led to believe that Dr. Bell was the prototype for Holmes.  At least one Holmes tale is used in the exposition of this DVD, that is, The Blue Carbunkle.  There may be other tales spread out in this story, but I m not expert enough to identify them.  Sherlock Holmes fans will like this.

1895223,4,B00009WVM1,Puts historical perspective on Arthur Conan Doyle to help explain the influences former teachers had on his literary works of Sherlock Holmes.

1895224,4,B00009WVM1,"Unfortunately this is a very limited series consisting of this almost two hour feature and a handful of additional episodes. It is based upon an imaginative reconstruction of the teacher-student relationship that did not in reality exist between medical student Conan Doyle and one of his Professors Dr. Bell. We know from Doyle that he was a student of Bell and based some aspects of Holmes  upon him. The nature of their interaction with each other and between them and others on this mini-series is purely fiction as are the 'cases' to which Bell, with Doyle's assistance, was involved.
As  was true of the excellent Sherlock Holmes series BBC put out some decades ago, Bell and Doyle is interesting but not exciting, there are no truly explosive incidents, no raw sex,  no shoot-outs, no cussin', just solid character development, realistic scenic design, and interactions on a plain human level.
Those who crave fast action and contemporary ethos will not be satisfied. Those who liked Inspector Morse, Inspector Lewis, and others of the staid school of law enforcement should find it nourishing fare.",1377820800,8,1106,5.065934065934066

Doyles' love/hate relationship with his famous character who took over his life to some degree. I will say that this production comes very close to meeting the level of production excellence of the Granada series starring Jeremy Brett, the consummate Holmes.

1895230,5,B00009WVM1,I'm a Sherlock fan.  This is good.  Gives you an idea of where the Sherlock stories came from as there really was a Dr. Bell.,1357948800,,125,3.96
1895231,5,B00009WVM1,"If you are looking at the original cover than I must tell you that, the female picture on the front is not Mr. Doyle. This is not a ""Glen or Glenda"" (1953) movie. Unless you are extraordinarily perceptive or well read, you need to read the rest of the title ""Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle - The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes"" (2000). The story almost plays and the unsaturated biography of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle with a few embellishments.

I will not go through the details, as they are fun to watch as the story unfolds. Needles to say we get to see how the different characters meet as a mystery unfolds. Moreover, of course there are plenty of suspects before it is always the last person you suspect. The story takes place in 1878, when medical student Mr. Doyle (Charles Dance) meets brilliant but quirky teacher Dr. Bell. Dr. Bell (Charles Dance) has a side project and recruits Mr. Doyle as his clerk. This is the main thread of the story as the mystery unfolds other threads and suspicious characters turn up. This mystery takes a backseat or parallels the fact that at this time and date ""Women"" are allowed but not approved as medical students. One particular woman struggling student from South Africa Elspeth Scott (Dolly Wells) strikes Mr. Doyle's fancy and becomes a woman in distress.

This film is packed with fine lesser-known actors. In fact, Dolly Wells lead me to this film as I was looking at information on Midsomer Murders: Death in Disguise (1999 TV episode) when it mentioned this movie.

At first, I thought it was a bit bloody and gory. However, there is nothing to outbalance the telling of the story. The only drawback is the heavy-handed background musing that tries to lead you mood wise as if you cannot think for yourself. The film would have been better off without it.

Be sure to read the cast profiles on the DVD as it contributes to the experience.",1353801600,,1885,4.601190476190476
1895232,5,B00009WVM1,"Very enjoyable and entertaining. Honestly, I find the mysterious 'Dark Beginnings' to be great relief from most mainstream productions today, which either involve predictable gore, special effects wizardry, or the 'boom' factor to keep one focused on the screen.
I won't pretend to be an expert on Sherlock Holmes, or any of the history or characters involved over the years. Instead I will say, if you like the theme behind Sherlock Holmes, you will find this story to be good, well produced, and enjoyable all around.",1341792000,,519,5.046511627906977
1895233,5,B00009WVM1,"This is a fascinating movie about the British author who created the much loved private detective, Sherlock Hoklmes.  According to lore (much if spawned by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself in a 1927 sound film in which he discusses his creation & psychic beliefs) a Dr. William Bell inspired Doyle.  Dr. Bell would often observe people and tell them which route they'd taken, or what they'd eaten, or --well, if you have read Sherlock Holmes, you know all those deductions.  They started with Bell.
The odd thing is we now know Bell may have actually aided authorities deal with some criminal matters in a way not dissimilar to Doyle's imaginative detective.  This movie is more than entertainment; it may actually have some basis in fact!  And one of those facts deals with one of the most notorious criminals of Victorian Society!

1895235,5,B00009WVM1,"I own all the Jeremy Brett ""Sherlock Holmes"" dvd's.  They are the best representation of Conan Doyle's stories.  This series is even darker but it also is very realistic.  It is a prequel to all the other stories from Conan Doyle's perspective.  It is very insightful into Doyle's background for his stories.",1317513600,11,308,4.865384615384615
1895236,5,B00009WVM1,"Judge James A. Stewart, DVD Verdict--It begins with Doyle (Robin Laing, Band of Brothers) telling a story while hiding out from enraged readers after bumping off Sherlock Holmes. He recalls his early meeting with Bell, whom he initially thought was rather, well, nuts. Bell's doing tests with whips and bullets on a dead body, and his reading of someone's life history from observations has the air of psychic parlor games. There's enough oddity and theatricality in the performance by Ian Richardson (Brazil) as Bell to make that initial underestimation believable, and enough passion and determination to make Doyle's later admiration believable as well. Doyle's impression of Bell changes when he sees the body of a beggar and realizes that the police aren't really looking too hard at the facts. Laing's Doyle is a fairly typical student, skeptical but willing to learn and genuinely caring about people.

From there, Doyle becomes Bell's clerk, and they head off in search of a serial killer with a mystery involving a bloody room, some possible poisonings, and severed ears. There's a solution, but Bell doesn't believe it, and that will make an impact on Doyle's life.

The picture and sound are quietly well-done, with no noticeable problems. Extras include a text biography of Doyle and production notes, both of which will help viewers to piece together what was real and what was fiction in Dark Beginnings. Cast bios and a DVD-ROM edition of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are also included. It's a decent DVD package, although viewers might be distressed to learn it only contains the initial movie, and not the follow-up series.

I don't believe Doyle was really out there playing Watson to Bell's Holmes, but the performances make the unlikely into something entertaining to contemplate.

1895237,5,B00009WVM1,"As I learned from a little research after viewing this new 2011 DVD release, the 117 minute film was produced by the BBC in 2000 as the pilot for TV series titled Murder Rooms. There were four subsequent hour-long episodes that were released on DVD (but not this pilot). This film - like most ""pilots"" stands on its own, though I might want to seek out the others - based on the high production values of the film.

The subject here is how author Arthur Conan Doyle created his character, Sherlock Holmes. Because of a restriction on Doyle's personal papers, there is not a lot of evidence of Doyle's early life. So the script is based on an ""idea"", rather than fact. But as a ""mystery"" this film is highly recommended. Ian Richardson, as Dr. Bell - for whom Doyle (allegedly) was a clerk while in medical college - is superb. And the much lesser known Robin Laing (as Doyle) is nearly as good. The cleverness of Bell's deductions which help find the serial killer are what keep you interested. And, since this is a ""period piece"", the film - at least in this transfer - doesn't appear dated.

There is the requisite ""romantic angle"" to the story but this is carried out without destroying the mystery.

The BFS release adds a few ""special features"" including ""text on screen"" Production Notes, Actor bios and - as a DVD-ROM bonus, the full text of the novel The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.

I enjoyed this and any Holmes fan - or lover of high quality BBC-TV dramas - should as well.

Yes, the episodes are utterly fascinating in terms of details and atmospherics. Yes, Ian Richardson would have made a terrific Holmes with his smouldering passion for justice working in tandem with his analytical mind. Yes, the story is very well crafted, and the film is one of the all-time best Sherlock Holmes-pastiches that has been made. My only regret is, this excellent film is devoid of subtitles, which often act as an invaluable tool for us, the non-English admirers of Holmes who are not used to hearing and comprehending even the ""British"" English when it is spoken fast & colloquially.

1895244,4,B00009WVM1,"I was wondering how much artistic license was taken with this series which imagines Conan Doyle solving mysteries with his medical school professor, Dr. Bell, played by Ian Richardson.  So I read up on it on Wikepedia.  Well, yes license has been taken but more with some parts of their pasts rather than others. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote Doyle from the South Seas, upon reading the Holmes tales, saying, ""Hey, I spotted my old pal, Joe Bell, in your stories."" Thus, Bell seems more authentic in the series than Doyle does.  Doyle is a mishmash of truth and fiction in the series.  True, he did become a believer in spiritualism (seances and such) influenced by deaths in his own life, his first wife and other relatives.  However, the fictional Doyle in the series is drawn to it because a serial killer murdered his first love, an utter fabrication! Basically as a vehicle to view Dr. Joseph Bell, this series succeeds very well. Ian Richardson as Bell is excellent.  However, the qualifier is that the Sherlock Holmes tales are even better, especially the ones as played by Jeremy Brett. One thing that is very authentic is that both Bell and Doyle were Scots.  Bell was a professor at Glasgow University.  In the series, everyone else is a Scot as well.  Holmes, however, was an Englishman but that was probably done to make him more accessible to readers around the world.

The story begins with Mr. Doyle in Edinburgh's medical school under the tutelage of Dr. Joseph Bell (Ian Richardson).  This is a tumultuous time for the school, since it's just been ruled women can be admitted.  Tempers run high as some instructors refuse to teach and fellow medical students cast imprecations upon their new colleagues.

Doyle, who is initially suspicious of Dr. Bell's methods considers the man a wizard or a charlatan. As Doyle follows Bell's early forensic investigations, he realizes there is a science to what initially appears divination. For example, a referred-to 'unseen killer' turns out to be a gas furnace rigged to asphyxiate an inconvenient wife sleeping in her bedchamber.

Both men become entangled in a serial murder case involving beggars and prostitutes.  The case gets politically shrouded when Sir Henry Carlyle's (Charles Dance) young wife comes down with syphilis and is slowly dying.

""Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle"" is a fascinating study of history.  Womens rights are birthing at the same time as the science of forensics and the way the two tie together fuses a riveting story.  I rented this film initially, but am planning to add it to my mystery collection.  The program is very well done and worth owning.

In that spirit I sought out ""Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle: The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes.""  The sub-title is necessary for those who do not know that Doyle's inspiration for Holmes came, in part, from Dr. Joseph Bell, one of Doyle's teachers.

Bell was a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh's medical school, where he taught students the importance of close observation in making a diagnosis.  This made him a forerunner in forensic pathology at a time when science was not yet a crucial part of solving crimes.  Today we live in the world of what is called the ""C.S.I. Effect,"" where juries demand the same sort of detailed forensic evidence they see on television, but Bell was breaking new ground.  Doyle met Bell in 1877 when the future author was a medical student, and served for a while as his clerk at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.  Much of Sherlock Holmes was clearly inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's creation, C. Auguste Dupin, but it was Dr. Bell's cutting edge work in deductive reasoning that gave the master detective his chief skill.

The conceit of ""Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle"" is that the young Doyle (Robin Laing) does more than study with Dr. Bell (Ian Richardson), becoming, in this fictional narrative, the ""Watson"" to the good Doctor's ""Holmes.""  That should be enough to whet your appetite to check out this British made for television movie, originally shown as ""Murder Rooms: ""The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes.""  The biggest the literary creations and the ""real"" Bell and Doyle is that even though Bell is called upon as a consultant the police find his every hypotheses to be preposterous and the young Doyle has trouble believing Bell's deductions are anything more than cheap parlor trips.  Another key elements in the initial story are the admittance of women to the University of Edinburgh's medical school.  Doyle becomes enamored with one of the new students, Elspeth Scott (Dolly Wells), who is a target of the Bible quoting misogynist, Crawford (Joel Strachan).  Meanwhile, Lady Sarah Carlisle (Ruth Platt), the wife of Sir Henry Carlyle (Charles Dance), has become ill and Bell's diagnosis becomes another point of contention between the student and his would be mentor.  These plot elements underscore the critique of Victorian society as having little regard for women, whether they are prostitutes or the wives of members of Parliament.  So there are myriad ways in which Bell is swimming against the tide.

Having thoroughly enjoyed Ian Richardson as Francis Urquhart in the ""House of Cards"" trilogy, seeing him play a more traditional hero rather than one more reminiscent of Shakespeare's Richard the III is an absolute treat, even if it means Laing's Doyle has a hard time being near the same playing field.  The game afoot in this 2000 BBC production is within the Holmes tradition, although my favorite moment is when Bell makes the mistake of offering some devastating deductions regarding Doyle's pocket watch.  I round down on this one only because the ending was too reminiscent of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Young-Sherlock-Holmes/dp/B0000AUHPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Young Sherlock Holmes</a>"" for my taste.  I was also at a loss to explain why the minimal framing device for the story was Doyle's decision to kill off his creation in ""The Final Problem,"" and the angry reaction of his readers.  But now that I am aware that this is but the opening gambit in a series of mysteries to be solved by Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle, I will defer judgment on that score until the others are available on DVD on this side of the pond (although I certainly share the impulse to just get a new toy that can handle PAL-discs so that I do not have to wait for shows that might never become available in the U.S.",1179532800,3,4485,5.406025824964132
1895253,5,B00009WVM1,Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle - The Dark Beginnings of Sherlock Holmes is one of two DVD's I have featuring Ian Richardson as Dr. Bell.  Both DVD's are fantastic.  The story is intriging and actually takes place before the Holmes stories were written.  The film features Dr. Arthur Conan Doyle and his teacher Dr. Bell.  Bell was the basis of Doyle's Sherlock Holmes character and was one of the first to use forensics to help solve crimes.  I highly recommend this DVD to any Sherlock fan.  I hope more are coming.,1172275200,,508,4.527472527472527

1895255,4,B00009WVM1,"On its own, or combined with the follow-up series Murder Rooms, 'Dr. Bell and Mr. Doyle' is well worth the price.  While I was already familiar with the follow up series, I was sadly unaware of the telefilm that started it all.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.

Fine sound and video quality, though lacking in other features.  You get what you pay for, it seems.  I recommend it as I recommended the Murder Rooms DVD.  If you like Holmes and Victoriana, it's a sure bet.  If not, look elsewhere.",1163030400,9,499,4.477777777777778
