It was a luxurios totally clean classic fashioable upper class house that the story was taking place.
The story was about upper class wholes who live and work in this house call <HOUSE OF TOLERNACE>.
The owner is a lady who has kids to feed and she knows how to control the ladies till she has trouble with budget and has to end up with closing down the house.

There are two particularly beautiful women I noticed. One was Cline Sallette who has a speck on her right side of her nose and the other was Adle Haenel who is now very very famous with Darden brother's movie <La fille inconnue> that went to Canne and almost won the best picture award. She is not untoucheable.

Two ladies are just exquisite and elegant.

The great about this movie is when the prostitutes are greeting their clients, they are not beeing nude at all.
Maybe beeing nude takes more money and that's the reason. Each men have sex with the ladies wearing their clothes on.
I don't even know how the men getting excited without seeing women naked though.
But whenever women are with their colleague, they are not afraid being naked. They chage clothes, look at theri bodies, talking about their breasts, and so on.
The movie is tend to be a softcore and the director wanted not to show the sex shots wthout women being naked at all I guess that make this movie differ from all the other erotic movies.

The music are full of old pop songs that are actually not matched with the era but still enjoyable very much.

The ending seems quite questionable when the main actress appears in the 21th century street wandering around looking for a client.
It is not possible since she was living in the early 20 century and even late 19th century. She should have been a woman who look similar to the woman we know.

Anyway, this movie is more for male and maybe those who are interested in night life in a whole house.
Very classy art style film you will face with.",1464652800,,2042,4.432

8515116,1,B007E88B02,"Yes, I did a mistake and bought this flick and, as I said its boring, slow and primitive; and in addition all movie confined  to a couple rooms and there is nothing to please eyes and nudity  limited to upper parts etc...in other words producer did everything possible to offend my intelligence.
I've seen about ten movies about houses of ill repute and most of them lousy except the one done by Tinto Brass which I consider my benchmark.
Yes, if you are under age of 18 you may learn something but I learned to read small prints where it says the movie has been nominated for...in other words its considered mainstream propaganda and sure such things as sex should be strongly suppressed by all and any means. Have a nice day.",1359331200,4,727,4.5
