2604573,5,B000GBEWP2,"Cedric Klapisch's 2005 film LES POUPEES RUSSES is a sequel to his effort of three years before, L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE (""The Spanish Apartment""). It's a very different sort of story. While the first film centered on the zany camaraderie that developed between several European students in Barcelona, LES POUPEES RUSSES focuses on the lovelives of a selected few characters, though Klapisch does briefly reunite the cast of the Spanish apartment. This review assumes that the reader has already seen L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE, a fine film I do recommend.

As LES POUPEES RUSSES opens, Xavier is now thirty, making his living in Paris ghostwriting celebrity autobiographies and scripting soap operas, while the manuscript of his Barcelona novel languishes in neglect. He has gone through numerous relationships since his return from Spain, and wallows in self-pity with Isabelle and Martine, both still alone as well. After an exposition on the misery of these characters, the main plot is set into motion by two events. One is Xavier's commute to London to work on a script with Wendy, now a writer herself. The other is William's engagement to a Russian dancer and move to Saint Petersburg, where he invites all his friends for the wedding. Though I shall avoid spoilers here, I can say that it is through his involvement in these goings-on that Xavier finally finds the stability he was looking for.

Lars, Tobias, Soledad, and Alessando only appear in the Saint Petersburg scenes, and are granted only a few lines each. Though it is rather curious that these characters were brought for probably the most expensive filming in spite of their peripheral roles, the viewer feels no outrage that they get so little screen time. At this point, one's sympathy is entirely with Xavier, Wendy, and William and his Russian bride, and so seeing some of the faces from L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE adds only a nice highlight on the years that have gone by.

For this reviewer, intrigued by the references to the building of a united Europe in L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE, the comments on society and politics in this film were powerful as well. If LES POUPEES RUSSES does not overtly speak of Europe's future, as in the first film when the students question the place of Catalan, the story is nonetheless based on growing changes in European youth. One is increased mobility. That a bunch of old friends from Spain can reunite in Saint Petersburg is a plausible development speaks much of how much young people travel now. Another is multilingualism, dialogues in LES POUPEES RUSSES are in English, French, Spanish, or Russian (with subtitles where necessary). And through the involvement of William's engagement to a Russian, the film shows that European integration goes beyond the borders of merely the EU.

But LES POUPEES RUSSES is also a beautiful love story. I was never content with the other portion of the plot of the first film, where alongside European changes we viewed the story of a young man finding himself. In Barcelona, the twenty-five year-old Xavier was acting like someone several years younger and some of the twists were silly. Here, however, the relationship between Xavier and the women he meets is entirely convincing, and the ending is one of the most satisfying and heartwarming I know of in film.

This reviewer finds himself at around the same point in life as Xavier, and resides in Europe with a similar multilingual and mobile lifestyle. Perhaps that is why the film is so touching for me, but I regrettably can't say what younger viewers in the United States might think of the film. Still, anyone is sure to finds LES POUPEES RUSSES a well-made and entertaining production.",1168041600,34,3674,4.98694942903752

2604575,3,B000GBEWP2,"Cdric Klapisch reassembled most of the cast of `L'Auberge espagnole' (`Spanish Apartment'), but it is Xavier (Roman Duris), French wannabe writer who holds the center of `Russian Dolls,' its sequel. That means, you don't have to watch `Spanish Apartment' to see it: what you see in `Russian Dolls' is the life of a struggling author who finds it very hard to find a true love after flirting with women around Europe.

Roman Duris plays again Xavier, no longer a student studying abroad, but working as a writer for magazines. He has been writing love stories, even ghost-writing for someone else and recently got a job as writer for a TV drama. Xavier, who is going to be 30, is aware that he is getting recognized professionally ... but of course not in the way he wanted. Still he has a good job, and he knows it, too, and he is ready to tell a lie or two before the executives if he can get another job that would bring him money.

But Klapisch's meandering script is more concerned with Xavier's love life which seems endless and pointless. It seems as if Xavier must go out with anyone around him in order to find a true love for him. That does not mean he is a Don Juan. It is more like he wants to really settle down, but just does not know with whom. Thus Xavier is seen sleeping with ladies, sometimes cheating on someone else. You may say (and director may say) he is just confused; I would say he is just irresponsible, only repeating the clichd image of certain types of males.

There are supports from two famous players: Audrey Tautou and Ccile De France. Not much can be said about their small roles except that Tautou plays a mother for the first time in her career.

There are good things in `Russian Dolls' I admit. The story about Russian ballet dancer is a sweet one, perhaps a better story than the main one; Xavier's attitudes to his profession have a ring of truth (and I personally experienced similar things). All the episodes about the marriage in Russia have humor and pathos, which Xavier's lengthy and sometimes boring story needs more. Xavier's indecisiveness about life is understandable, but his confused idea about love is just incomprehensible. I think I know the film's title refers to Russian toy; I understand the `doll-within-doll-within doll' image, but to understand someone deeper is one thing, to keep looking for another girl is absolutely another.",1164326400,11,2391,4.658767772511848
2604576,5,B000GBEWP2,"A worthy sequel to The Spanish Apartment, this is a mature love story. Complex, a little nasty, a little dirty, a little bit like life itself. I really loved it.",1163894400,4,161,4.4
2604577,4,B000GBEWP2,"If you're like me, you will seek out ""Russian Dolls"" once you realize that it's a sequel to director/writer Cdric Klapisch's 2002 breakout hit ""L'Auberge Espagnole.""  Now, that was a great movie - funny, wildly inventive (I still remember with perfect clarity four years later how Klapisch depicted Parisian bureaucracy - slapping form after form on the screen), likable characters...the works.

So, the obvious question will be: How does 'Dolls' measure up? Sorry to say it just doesn't have the same energy or likability.  It's _okay_ on its own, frankly, but ""L'Auberge"" gives it a high bar to aim for and it falls short of the mark.  Romain Duris' character, Xavier - the guy we want to root for - has become very unlikeable here (and I'm a big Duris fan), passing up Audrey Tautou (hello?) then Kelly Reilly on his way to...well, he's not really sure.  This is where the title comes into play...he keeps looking for the next girl, who surely will be the perfect one (""You just keep opening them like Russian nested dolls hoping that the one in the center will be your choice"").  Okay, that's a good one.  But, my wife and I watched and felt Klapisch had lost the audience: we no longer wanted Xavier to succeed (or perhaps we wish he had succeeded in somewhat less than 125 minutes).

Kudos to Klapisch though for bringing back Kevin Bishop's brilliant 'William' character and making him a major part of the movie.  He's great once again here.

Also, if you want to check out Romain Duris in quite a different role, don't miss him in Jacques Audiard ""The Beat That My Heart Skipped.""",1163376000,2,1588,4.679856115107913
2604578,4,B000GBEWP2,"RUSSIAN DOLLS ('Les Poup&eacute;es russes') is the full of love folllowup by C&eacute;dric Klapisch to his highly successful 2002 film 'L'Auberge Espagnole', the film that tossed multinational young people together in a Barcelona apartment and watched them interact and create some sense out of the havoc that was their lives.  Klapisch has fine comic timing, a sense of spontaneity, and a cast lifted from his previous film - all ingredients for a fine little spin on current relationships.  If the film is too much in love with itself, (the self-indulgent multiple split screen viewing and back and forth pacing tends to be a bit cutesy), in the end there is so much fun and wry wisdom to spread around that many of the holes in the script can be forgiven.

The story focuses on event five years after the Barcelona doings in 'L'Auberge Espagnole' and yet as the main character Xavier Rousseau (Romain Duris) narrates the current tale he finds the need for flashbacks to explain current circumstances. William (Kevin Bishop), the bigot from before who labeled roommate Tobias (Barnaby Metschurat) as a Nazi, has smoothed out a bit and in fact has found love in a Russian girl Natacha (Evguenya Obraztsova), a Russian ballet dancer who lives in St. Petersburg and the current story is supposed to be about their wedding in St. Petersburg which will also be a reunion for all the roommates from Barcelona. Xavier is a writer who is forced to be a ghostwriter for celebrities who want to publish memoirs because he has difficulty writing a silly television love series and is stuck in his writing of his own novel.  He cannot keep relationships (but then very few in this group of friends can) and he teeters between his allegiance to his ex Martine (Audrey Tautou), while moving in on one of the celebrity interviewees Celia (Lucy Gordon).  He is warned by his lesbian roommate Isabelle (C&eacute;cile De France) about his wanton ways but Xavier uses Isabelle as cover for his 98-year-old grandfather (Pierre G&eacute;rald), who insists he marry. Xavier toys with a beautiful black girl Kassia (Assa Maga) and is rejected, and just about the time when Xavier feels as though he will never find the right girl ('You just keep opening them like Russian nested dolls hoping that the one in the center will be your choice'), his script is picked up by BBC and he flies to London to work with Wendy (Kelly Reilly - William's attractive sister, unsuccessful in finding a decent mate) and voila!  The rest of the intrigue is best left to the viewer: it does become complicated and multilingual and hilarious...and touching.

Weaving all the cast members form his first film into the resolution of the second film proves to have some problems in continuity, but then this is not great writing nor was it meant to be. This is French comedy in fine form and is a thoroughly entertaining film and the chance to watch some beautiful people display how crazy relationships today have become.

2604579,5,B000GBEWP2,I think this may even be better than L'Auberge.  This is a laugh-out-loud at the awkwardness of real life situations film.  You do not have to be a francophile to enjoy this film - my husband loved it as well.,1158192000,,209,4.2
2604580,5,B000GBEWP2,"""Les poupees russes"" (= ""Russian dolls"") is the sequel to ""L Aubergue espagnole"" (= ""The Spanish apartment""), an entertaining film about young people living in a foreign country and trying to find their path in life.

The director of both films is Cedric Klapisch, the subject is more or less the same, and all the actors of the first movie are present in the sequel. The difference is that ""Les poupees russes"" is better than ""L Aubergue espagnole"", due to the fact that it ties some plot holes, and allows us to see what happens to the characters. Are they mature, or merely older? And what happened to Xavier (Romain Duris), the young man from France who wanted to be a writer?

I thoroughly enjoyed discovering the answers to those questions, and I think the same thing will happen to you. All in all, ""Les poupees russes"" is not an excellent movie, but it is a very entertaining one, and I am pretty sure you will like it. Recommended!

The international collectors edition is a region 2 enoded movie, but if you have one of many dvd players that through a little passcode on the controller will play any movie of any region.

2604582,5,B000GBEWP2,"Let me begin by saying that I am not often compelled to review films, mostly because let's face it, people really cannot care that much about whatever it is that I (or anyone else) has to say about someone else's work. However, I write this brief review for those of you who would have otherwise overlooked this strangely compelling movie. This movie successfully depicts the idiosyncrasies of love and relationships through a rather complex and quirky network of stories. Stylistically this movie is young, and fast- something resembling the ethereal nature and nostalgia of a collection of unforgettable memories. The acting is strong, as is the directing, and cinematography. The soundtrack is delightful and plays a substantial role in the development of the film. Even though this movie is not without its flaws,  Les Poupees Russes succeeds at presenting a compelling and touching story about the power (destructive as it may be) of raw, cliche-free (or often unapologetically  clichd) love.",1155340800,4,997,5.225

2604610,2,B000GBEWP2,"The eagerly awaited sequel (though you can still watch this one without having seen the first one) of ""L'Auberge Espagnole"". In this one, Xavier (Romain Duris) plays the part of a male diva who can't find any satisfaction or happiness in life, or women as he is always pursuing some ideal fantasy while ignoring and hurting the ones closest to him. Audrey Tautou returns, for no apparent reason i this film as her part both here and in the previous film could have been played by anyone - no doubt to cash in on her popularity after ""Amelie"" - as a bitter unmarried or divorced b-word for a difficult woman, with an ugly kid, dumping him on Xavier while she flies to brazil, pretending to take up A Cause to save whatever they need saving in the 3rd world, so that people in rich countries like France can feel ""better"" about ""saving humanity"". The film is 90% about Xavier, and the rest of the cast have to split the difference. The German, Spanish and Italian characters are practically ignored here, but brought out in the last 5 minutes of the film to complete the presence of the whole group. While in the first film it was all fun and pretty much evenly divided, in this one, Xavier comes off as a selfish, unkind rat who, like Gene Simmons - is just too ugly in real life to get the beautiful women he gets in the film. Suspension of disbelief indeed. I came out of the theater feeling kind of cheated, and bitter after seeing it. It wasn't a bad movie, it's just it wasn't even close to being as good as the first one. I missed ""Chinese Puzzle"" (2013) which is the sequel to THIS ONE, but I'll try to rent it or borrow it to see if the next one is any better. From what I've read, Xavier and I guess the whole cast move to New York. Why not? Even Jason Vorhees and Charles Bronson moved to NYC to make follow up films in their respective series. I lived in NY for 26 years. I now live in FL. I cannot believe to this day I lived in that ghetto. But I guess the promise of NYC in films is that ""anything can happen"" there rather than make the film in Chattanooga, Tennessee or Jacksonville FL. I'll give it a shot this weekend but I think it will probably fall prey to the siren call of repeating decades of NYC film cliches and utter lies, like finding a parking space in front of the loft the star of the film lives in on his/her minimum wage job at a magazine gopher or serving tables.",1431388800,,2395,4.254385964912281

2604647,4,B000GBEWP2,"In anticipation of seeing the latest installment in this franchise, 2013's ""Chinese Puzzle"", I decided to re-watch the first two movies, the 2002 ""L'auberge espagnol"" and this one. I hadn't seen either of them since they first came out, and was curious to see how well they'd stand up after all these years.

""Russian Dolls"" (2005 release from France; 120 min.; original title ""Les poup&eacute;es russes"") takes place 5 years after the first movie. Our main man, Xavier, is now approaching 30, and his life is as unsettled as ever. As the movie opens, we see the entire gang of Barcelona getting together for a wedding in St. Petersburg, Russia (we don't know whose wedding), and then in a flashback, Xavier recounts the story of how it all came to this. Given that this is a plot-heavy movie, to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll really want to see for yourself how it all unfolds.

Couple of comments: the first movie was an unexpected box office bonanza in Europe (and did quite well also in the US at the art-house theater circuit), so it's not a surprise that writer-director C&eacute;dric Klapisch came up with the idea for a sequel. Xavier, played by the charming Romain Duris carries this movie on his back, and very well so. The great thing is that Klapisch has matured the Xavier character and exposes us to him as a real person, with real flaws. It would've been so much easier to avoid those complications, as Xavier, warts and all, is a very likeable character, but it adds to the depth (and the enjoyment) of the movie. Unlike the first movie, when Wendy (played by British actress Kelly Reilly) was barely on the radar screen, she gets a huge, and frankly pivotal, role in the movie. Also interesting is that her brother William (played by Kevin Bishop), who was such an unlikeable character in the first movie, gets an almost complete transformation in this. The movie takes places in Paris, London, and St. Petersburg, and as such it becomes a very enjoyable travelogue for those cities, and make you want to visit these places.

Bottom line: I really enjoyed seeing ""Russian Dolls"" again after all these years, although I still feel that it doesn't quite capture the magic that was the first movie. If, on the other hand, you haven't seen this, by all means, check it out, I think you will enjoy it quite a bit (but make sure you see ""L'auberge espagnol"" first).",1403395200,,2404,4.691943127962086

Added to this fact, the main characters from ""L'auberge Espagnol"", much like acquaintances I  haven't seen for a while,  and which I found appealing and interesting the first time around, continue their story in ""Russian Dolls"".  While Audrey Tatou and Cecile De France perform quite well in their roles, I found Kelly Reilly's performance, in the role of Wendy, to be the most compelling.  A pleasure to the eyes, as well as to listen to, she offers a superb low-key portrayal as the plot twists unexpectedly toward her, as the unsuspecting love of Xavier's life.  Delightful cinematography, well-acted, entertaining plot.  If you only see one french romantic movie, you won't go wrong by choosing to make it this one.",1389657600,,1080,4.988826815642458

Some think this is because Romain Duris is a bad actor, but as a matter of fact, it is not because he is a bad actor, it is because he is a great actor for this role that people hate this character. Xavier is an egoist character that starts out as a selfish jerk that wants a girly girl princess for a girlfriend. It's a movie about Xavier's growth as a person, as a functioning adult. As the name suggests, he opens each new layer of his russian doll (his love life, life, etc, whatever you might think it is) thinking he needs more than this, only to discover that there is another layer. At the end, he finds the itty bitty russian doll inside all the other ones and tries to open it yet again in hopes of finding more, and fails.

The major portion of LES POUPEES RUSSES (RUSSIAN DOLLS) deals with Xavier's (Romain Duris) inability to find success as a serious writer and happiness in his unsuccessful search for true love, Wendy's (Kelly Reilly) involvement in a disastrous relationship with a verbally abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Isabelle's (Cecile de France) troubles with lesbian love interests, and Martine's (Audrey Tautou) problems with past lovers while raising her very young son.

2604709,5,B000GBEWP2,"This is gratifying, intelligent and challenging comedy, that explores zealously the masculine universe with all its hidden contradictions. The Epicurean desire to resume the pretended happiness around the possession of all kind of women makes us to reflect around what is the final goal of this man, accustomed to obtain a yes as answer, but that in the eve of his thirty years old, begins to wonder what's going on. And, since he is a hired writer of love stories, the contradiction is even major.

There is a narrow resemblance respect that classic film of Truffaut, ""The man who loved the women"" , but this bitter comedy carves in relief these intimacies, this nestled sense of possession to reaffirm oneself as man, and curiously the woman he will chose at the end is certainly the distilled result of his work, a sort of dynamic and ceaseless energy, afar from social conventionalism and able to think and even face him from time to time, but all the way through he will experience winning and falling the bitter taste of the possession by itself without major concessions.

The cast is extraordinary, but Audrey Tatoo and Reilly shine with radiant splendor. The locations in Paris, San Petersburg and London are a big frame in which we will delight and enjoy more than once the contradictions of this man trapped in what we should call the globalization of the feeling, perhaps?

2604712,5,B000GBEWP2,"Cedric Klapisch's 2005 film LES POUPEES RUSSES is a sequel to his effort of three years before, L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE (""The Spanish Apartment""). It's a very different sort of story. While the first film centered on the zany camaraderie that developed between several European students in Barcelona, LES POUPEES RUSSES focuses on the lovelives of a selected few characters, though Klapisch does briefly reunite the cast of the Spanish apartment. This review assumes that the reader has already seen L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE, a fine film I do recommend.

As LES POUPEES RUSSES opens, Xavier is now thirty, making his living in Paris ghostwriting celebrity autobiographies and scripting soap operas, while the manuscript of his Barcelona novel languishes in neglect. He has gone through numerous relationships since his return from Spain, and wallows in self-pity with Isabelle and Martine, both still alone as well. After an exposition on the misery of these characters, the main plot is set into motion by two events. One is Xavier's commute to London to work on a script with Wendy, now a writer herself. The other is William's engagement to a Russian dancer and move to Saint Petersburg, where he invites all his friends for the wedding. Though I shall avoid spoilers here, I can say that it is through his involvement in these goings-on that Xavier finally finds the stability he was looking for.

Lars, Tobias, Soledad, and Alessando only appear in the Saint Petersburg scenes, and are granted only a few lines each. Though it is rather curious that these characters were brought for probably the most expensive filming in spite of their peripheral roles, the viewer feels no outrage that they get so little screen time. At this point, one's sympathy is entirely with Xavier, Wendy, and William and his Russian bride, and so seeing some of the faces from L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE adds only a nice highlight on the years that have gone by.

For this reviewer, intrigued by the references to the building of a united Europe in L'AUBERGE ESPAGNOLE, the comments on society and politics in this film were powerful as well. If LES POUPEES RUSSES does not overtly speak of Europe's future, as in the first film when the students question the place of Catalan, the story is nonetheless based on growing changes in European youth. One is increased mobility. That a bunch of old friends from Spain can reunite in Saint Petersburg is a plausible development speaks much of how much young people travel now. Another is multilingualism, dialogues in LES POUPEES RUSSES are in English, French, Spanish, or Russian (with subtitles where necessary). And through the involvement of William's engagement to a Russian, the film shows that European integration goes beyond the borders of merely the EU.

But LES POUPEES RUSSES is also a beautiful love story. I was never content with the other portion of the plot of the first film, where alongside European changes we viewed the story of a young man finding himself. In Barcelona, the twenty-five year-old Xavier was acting like someone several years younger and some of the twists were silly. Here, however, the relationship between Xavier and the women he meets is entirely convincing, and the ending is one of the most satisfying and heartwarming I know of in film.

This reviewer finds himself at around the same point in life as Xavier, and resides in Europe with a similar multilingual and mobile lifestyle. Perhaps that is why the film is so touching for me, but I regrettably can't say what younger viewers in the United States might think of the film. Still, anyone is sure to finds LES POUPEES RUSSES a well-made and entertaining production.",1168041600,,3674,4.98694942903752

This film is #2 in a trilogy of films by director Cedric Klapisch. The trilogy consists of L'auberge espagnole (2002). Russian Dolls (2005), and Chinese Puzzle (2013). Each film in the trilogy is a ""stand alone"" film, which means that you can completely enjoy each film without needing to see either of the others. However, I would strongly urge you to see all three & view them all in a short span of time, #1, then #2, then #3. This trilogy is a True Cinematic Masterpiece in my opinion. The way Klapisch was able to make 3 distinct stand alone films, whose main characters are the same, and whose story lines fit seamlessly from one film to the next is a work of Genius. You will probably never have a film viewing experience as unique & interesting as viewing this entire trilogy. I HIGHLY Recommend it.

The entire trilogy experience was great, and each story can standalone on its own. This particular piece, Russian Dolls, is very integral though as it ties the story together.
With Xavier and his friends now in their 30s, this was especially relatable. It can be cheesy and cliched in some parts, but even those parts lend a certain comic balance to what could otherwise be an emotional experience.

And this is a characteristic I noticed of the series, that as they completed the trilogy in over a decade, they also let the authenticity of the actors' real age and life stage shine through.",1465516800,,724,4.700787401574803
