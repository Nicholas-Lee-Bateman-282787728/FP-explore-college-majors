music of this area is outstanding.  I will

3068955,5,B0011UY65I,"This is a wonderful performance, my favorite of all of Andre Rieu's videos.  Combination of beautiful music, breathtaking scenery and sets, and wonderful dancing and costumes.  Five stars all the way, very highly recommended.",1227398400,6,225,5.588235294117647
3068956,5,B0011UY65I,"In my opinion, Live in Vienna and Home Coming are his best Videos. The two songs I like best are Wien,du Stadt Meiner Traume(Vienna,City and My Dreams) and ""Lippen schweigen"" from the Merry Widow.",1227312000,,196,4.794117647058823
3068957,5,B0011UY65I,"Tastes are, of course, subjective, but, in my opinion, ""Live in Vienna"" is far and away the best concert ever performed by Andre' Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra. (My second favorite would be ""At the Schoennbrunn"" - Andre' is always at his best performing in the Land of Strauss).

I first saw this concert advertiesed by my local PBS channel during one of their fund drives and assumed that it was one I had already seen (after all, he has certainly performed in Vienna enough times.) Much to my pleasant surprise the very first selection. Vienna Citizens"" was a waltz I had not heard in 20 years and I had never heard performed by Andre' Rieu. I remembered it as one of my all time favorite ""Strauss waltzes"" Imagine my chagrin when I subsequently discovered that it had been composed by Carl Michael Ziehrer, a younger contemporary of Johann Straus II. Oh well, it's a beautiful waltz anyway.

Early on a number of young ladies in evening gowns and young men in ""Hapsburg"" uniforms performed a visually beautiful ""Fledermaus Quadrille"" in the sumptious ballrooms of the Imperial Apartments. Thirty years ago my late wife and I went to Vienna and saw what may have been the precursors to this group. It certainmly brought back pleasant memories. This was followed by more waltz music including the ""Gold and Silver Waltz by Lehar (another one on my favorites.)

A change of pace was introduced at this point with a Mozart medley during which the orchestra mirthfully played a few bars of that well known Mozart melody ""Twinkle, Twinkle
Little Star"" while a large portrait of Mozart ""winked"" at the audience. Most impressive during the Mozart segment was the piano solo by a lovely young pianist whose keyboard stylings
were surehanded as well as delicate. I imagined that she played it pretty much the way that Mozart wanted it played.

After Mozart we returned to Strauss and his most famous operetta ""Die Fledermaus."" My favorite Andre Rieu vocalist, Carla Maffioletti, always bursting with personality, gave us
her lovingly flirtatious rendition of ""The Laughing Song"" (you guessed it - one of my favorites). There are fewer more pleasurable events in the musical world than watching
and listening to Carla Maffioletti in action.

As I said at the olutset tastes are subjective and my reasons for giving this DVD five stars is very subjective. How could I give anything less to a DVD that is nothing less than a non-stop rendition of all my favorite melodies. In addition to those mentioned I'll just list ""The Merry ""Widow,"" ""Treasure"" waltz, ""Morning Papers"" waltz and the hauntingly beautiful ""Vienna, City of My Dreams.""

The usual cast of Andre Rieu characters are present here including vocalists Karl Moik, The Platin Tenors, Carmen Monarcha, the lovely Suzanne Ehrens, Roger the trumpet player, the fellow who does tricks with his trombone, the pretty blonde cellist who always looks like she's having the time of her life, and, of course, the great Andre' Rieu himself.",1225584000,29,2989,4.908910891089109
3068958,5,B0011UY65I,"My wife and I have enjoyed viewing this DVD production very much.  We watched it again last night.  The music is excellent.  The staging is excellent, set in the site of the Vienna palace.  The ""debutante couples"" waltzing on stage and in the Emperor's Ballroom, additional dancers from the Vienna Ballet and Folk Dance Group, scenes from Vienna and Austria, great performances by singers Carla Mafioletti, Carmen Monarcha, Susan Erens, and the Australian Marusia (I didn't get her last name) add to the orchestal excellence of the Johann Strauss Orchestra.  I think this DVD is the best one yet that Andre Rieu has produced.",1225497600,12,625,4.971153846153846
3068959,5,B0011UY65I,"Again,this was a second gift from myself to my Mother,and she loved it! It is far more complete than the version shown recently on PBS T.V.stations,the video/audio are of very good top quality,over all,if you enjoy Andre Rieu concerts,and his music,you will love this! Buy it and enjoy it! My Mother is a number#1 fan of Andre Rieu!",1225238400,3,332,4.741379310344827
3068960,5,B0011UY65I,"I recieved this newly released DVD (30 Sept 2008) as a pleasant surprise gift from a very good friend of mine(EC)who also caught the virus of classical music being spread worldwide by Andre Rieu.

Overall,compared with previous Andre's Concert DVD's,there is a marked increase of the usual elegance and finesse in the innovated presentation of Andre Rieu being accompanied by the Johann Strauss orchestra and choir. It is more apparent when we consider the concert is being held in Vienna, the home of the Strauss family and the birthplace of the waltz.

The stage is set up in Michaeler Square on the doorsteps(literally) of the Imperial Hofburg Palace in Vienna city center. A big 'Bravo' to the Stage Designer Marianne & Johny Lochner for their innovation about setting up two dance floors,one on each side of the orchestra bay. An extension of the dance floors is inside the original magnificent dance floor of the Imperial Hofburg Palace with its numerous classical chandeliers. This latter is shown on widescreens provided for the spectators. As expected, the inside ballroom of the palace displays all the sumptuous splendour and grandeur as it did in the 19th Century when Johann Strauss was teaching the world and Queen Victoria to waltz!

The performers on the dance floors are the outstanding Ballet group of The Vienna State Opera, Thomas Elmeyer group of Debutante Couples and the Folk Opera group of Vienna. In the various appropriate traditional costumes they open the show/concert with  a pre-Strauss era ,Church approved 'strict' Quadrille formation dancing  which easily  transport the spectators to the time and place.

 Andre's brief historical account of how the Waltz caused 'all hell to break loose' and 'stormed the world' has his usually witty sense of humour.

 The repertoire, once again , has been very carefully and appropriately chosen to reflect the time and place with the usual high standard. The first waltz is the 'Gold and Silver Waltz' which gives us an almost complete reconstruction of the original time and place when it was composed and played thereafter.

 Throughout the concert/show the same standard is meticulously maintained.
The soloists adapt beautifully to that era. The manner in which Carmen,Carla and Suzan thank the audience has innovated in a more elegant way that belongs to that time. The Australian newcomer Mirusia has joined the group very smoothly . The new hairstyle of the soloists and members of the orchestra perhaps appear to be more suited for the 2007 midsummer one(the date of the concert) rather than one of that time.

 I must accept that I fail to understand the short Moulin Rouge type of show at the end of The Platin's Tenors and The Soloists fantastic and serious interpretation from 'The Merry Widow'. Somehow I feel that these latter might not have felt at ease as they were still on stage.

 Suzan Erens is ,once again, fabulous in her interpretation of 'Sound of Music ' which is a tribute to Austria where the movie was made in the midst of its breathtaking sceneries in the valleys of the Alps.

 Carmen Monarcha's interpretation of 'Meine Lippen sie Kussen so heiss' displays an outstandingly perfect inovated stage show. She excels and surpasses herself with  a high degree of impressive perfection. She very well deserves the standing ovation she gets from the orchestra,Andre and the audience.

 The interpretation of 'The Waltz of All Waltzes' took  new higher dimensions with the waltzing ( Floating and swaying) of the dancers on the dance floors on the sides of the orchestra bay. The costumes of Elmeyer's dancing group 'Debutante Couples' are perfectly appropriate and they manage the cheeky hesitation beats of Andre Rieu very well. They are outstanding again in 'Morgen bluner'.It is a pity that M.Krammer( the main cameraman) did not give us more wideangle views, from 60 degrees above the horizontal specially that the DVD is excellent in the 16:9 format. I feel we had too many closeups views and not enough of the orchestra together with the two dance floors.

 With Andre's touch of humour he gets Thomas Elmeyer to issue an anti aging and increasing longetivity prescription to all concerned!

 The usual cheerful,lively and joyful feeling among the members of the orchestra and choir and, of course, Andre's become contagious and overcome the spectators who joins in a swaying frenzy throughout and,more so,towards the end of the show.

 The guest artist Dagmer Koller lives up very well to her name of 'La Grande Dame de Vienne' in her interpretation of 'Vienna,City of My Dreams'. She joins in the grande finale 'Adieu,mein kliner Gardeoffizier'.

 There is a banner in the audience that summarises this very successful Concert/Show appropriately .It shows a picture of Andre and it reads ""DON'T STOP"". At least we have it for 135 minutes on DVD(containing extra tracks not shown on public television).

 So enjoy it again and again....",1224633600,38,4939,5.044334975369458
3068961,5,B0011UY65I,I grew up listening to classical music. My parents are pretty hard core classical music listeners. All of my family enjoyed this awesome DVD. the scenery is beautiful and songs and pieces they play are very familar pieces. It actually makes you feel like you are actually there at the concert. There's brazilian singer in this performance - she's amazingly good!,1224633600,2,362,4.950819672131147
3068962,5,B0011UY65I,"This is a 2007 mid-summer concert which took place in front of imperial Hofburg Palace in the center of Vienna.

DVD (DVD9) is in Widescreen (16:9) format with DD5.1 and DD2.0 sound option. Andre Rieu speaks in German but subtitles are available. Main feature runs for 135mins. There are no extra features.

Playlist selection is wonderful with 25 classical hits. Some of them we know from other DVDs of Rieu, but there are some new pieces we will hear in this DVD. There are waltzes, polkas, arias and musical pieces. According to me highlights are All Strauss Waltzes, Eine kleine Nachtmusik (Mozart Medley), The Sound of Music, and Arias. The Johann Strauss Orchestra is accompanied by Choir and joined by guest stars namely The Platine Tenors, Dogmar Koller, Carmen Monarcha, Carla Maffioletti, Mirusia Louwerse and Suzan Erens. They all have wonderful performances. Also the Ballet of the Vienna State Opera, the Vienna debutantes from the Elmayer Dance School joins the Viennese ambient with their waltzes.

One of the best of Andre Rieu's (according to me the other bests are Homecoming and the Schonbrunn Concerts). Especially if you love the waltzing themes, this one is for you with lots of waltzes in the heart of waltz-capital of Europe, Vienna. You will enjoy a real Viennese Night in your homes.

3068963,5,B0011UY65I,"All the previous reviews have approximated justice for the DVD and I do definitely agree with them although I don't speak German and depend on Closed Captions (CC). And that in no way interferes with the performance.
However, I purchased the DVD not for any of the other performances on the DVD, but for Tiffany's rendering of Ballade pour Adeline.  Never before have I heard musical notes played like raindrops on the keyboard.  Cleyderman- Eat your heart out!  Although  his fame and technical mastery of the piece is without fault, he in no way delivers - as the lady above stated - as the author must have intended for it to be played.  Andre, she's amazing and you hide her up there almost out of sight! Fie!  I would love to hear her play Claire de Lune.
Tiffany I'm in love with you.  You can play my piano anytime... cut an album... do a single... I'll buy them.
And that's all I got to say about that.",1468108800,,910,4.413173652694611

3069021,1,B0011UY65I,"When I immigrated from Germany to Hamburg in 2002, Andr Rieu was already famous and touring Germany. However, I never went to one of his concerts and as I hardly ever watch TV, I didn't see his orchestra on TV either.

So last week we finally got his CD from the public library totally unbiased and listened to it.
We are both Strauss fans and love the Strauss waltzes from the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

We listened to the first waltz on the Rieu CD (On the beautiful blue Danube) and shook our heads. What happened to this once so lovely and energetic waltz? This sounded as if a 3 man band played it. Waltzes HAVE to be played by a huge orchestra in order to sound right!!! This is not what Strauss had on his mind when he composed his waltzes.

Well, we listened to a few more waltzes (Voices of Spring is usually my favorite waltz), but with every new song we got the feeling, we heard the previous song. Totally uninspired music. There was absolutely no difference between each waltz. Very repetitive.
A small chamber orchestra really shouldn't play waltzes.
If I could give zero stars, I would have done it.
This kind of music is an affront/insult to every waltz lover!",1339372800,5,1181,4.509345794392523

3069027,5,B0011UY65I,"Another great Andre Rieu DVD, thus 5 stars. But why does he limit his repertoire? We all love Lehar and Strauss but there were other composers of light Viennese music? Has Andre ever heard of Karl Ziehrer, Leo Fall, Heinrich Reinhardt, Leon Jessel or any other not to famous composers? And what about Oskar Nedbal, though Czech, who wrote such glorious music in the same vein? He lets Lehar and Strauss drown almost everything else. Hopefully this will someday change as he could do do much for minor composers.

Possibly he may also discover Victor Herbert, whose delightful American music has been forgotten by even American conductors. Herbert and Rieu were made for each other. If only they were acquainted.",1268006400,,711,4.925
3069028,5,B0011UY65I,"'Andre Rieu: Live from Vienna' is, without question, one of the most outstanding Andre concerts I've had the privilege to watch.

The setting is the plaza in front of the beautiful Hofburg Palace in central Vienna. Recorded on a quiet, beautiful and warm (audience and ladies of the orchestra in bare shoulders) summer evening; a perfect set of conditions for a concert such as this.

First, the technical:

It's hard to imagine all the technical and logistical happenings that had to occur to make this evening a success. The plaza had a false floor inserted for seating accommodations and traffic was apparently rerouted around the area for a week in advance of the concert to allow the structural changes needed in the plaza to occur. The lighting, cameras were all perfectly placed, helping give that subtle, wonderful ambiance to the evening as night gradually overtook the concert.

Then there was the coordination of the different concert elements...the orchestral, the costumes, the dancers. The number of rehearsals and the amount of time involved must have been staggering to get a concert of this size and magnitude to come off without an apparent hitch (even though I realize the final DVD product probably received major editing.

I also like the candid shots of the audience...some caught singing, dancing and just generally enjoying themselves; and oh yes, there was the occasional tear.

Second, the performance:

The concert program featured several of Vienna's (plus surrounding areas) own historically prominent musicians; the most famous being Johann Strauss and W. A. Mozart, just to mention two. In fact the theme of the night was predominantly Strauss waltzes. One great melody after another, enhanced by the wonderful locale, costumes, players and dancers.

But, more than just the setting and the music, the intangible quality that sets Andre Rieu's shows apart, is the obvious and sincere fun everyone on stage is having during the performance. And make no mistake about it, no one is having more fun than Andre, and this attitude seems to radiate from him and infects the rest of his cast. A joy to watch, as well as hear.

Conclusion:

A stunning DVD. Filled with all the pomp and pageantry that gives the viewer a small glimpse of what the old Austrian empire must have been like at its zenith, when it was considered to be the cultural center of the world.

A couple of things regarding Andre Rieu.
A tip of the hat for his foresight and perseverance to pull a show like this off; the worries and concerns must have been enormous, but you'd never know it to watch him on-stage.  Always smiling and directing his charges with a smile,  a look , an eyebrow or a stroke of his bow...all with the confidence of the consummate professional.

Three personal favorite moments (from many):

1.)Andre's short solo performance of the violin sonata/concerto during the Mozart medley.
2.)Carla Maffioletti's 'Mein Herr Marquis' from Stauss's 'Die Fledermaus'.
3.)The ballet by the Vienna Ballet and Folk Dance group of 'Ganz onhe Weiber geht die Chose nicht' from 'The Gypsy Princess'. (stunning costumes that flowed and moved perfectly with the music)

P.S.
And for all that I loved this performance, it still comes in second place among all other Andre Rieu's DVDs. My favorite is the show from Tuscany, Italy...a smaller, more intimate setting that oozes unbridled joy and spontaneity.",1266105600,,3421,5.0265486725663715

3069042,5,B0011UY65I,"In my opinion this video rates in the same class as The Homecoming, that is to say one of his best efforts.

The setting, in front of the Imperial Palace is splendid.  The sound and video work is superlative, as always.

In this video one can see a more mature set of singers, their voices and manners even more accomplished.  The two ladies from Brazil have always been wonderful performers, but here they display a more refined and effusive delivery.  Besides those two there are other singers, including some from Austria, who add color and luster to an already outstanding effort.

One is treated to dancers as well, in period costume and dancing in the imperial palace!  A visual treat to say the least; radiant Austrian girls, stunning in their lovely ball gowns and accompanied by gallant gentlemen.  Breathtaking!

At the beginning one can note a hint of tension in Andre as he comes on stage and addresses the musicians.  Clearly he is playing the  worldwide capital of music, and the very soul of Austria is going to judge his efforts. The mayor of the city is in attendance and the audience is critical to say the least.

In addition, he alludes briefly during his comments to having had to block traffic in one of the most crowded areas of the city, and the problems that caused him and his people.  So certainly there is good reason for his tension.

The listeners are more jaded here, the music of Strauss runs in their veins.  It would take a superlative performance just to satisfy them, let alone genuinely impress.  So ones sees a more reserved audience than is normal in his other videos.  However, by the end of the tape he has even those people standing, a real tribute to a master showman!

I cannot recommend this video more highly, it is not a simple duplicate of previous music in a different setting, it is a totally new effort,with new songs, different singers and dancers who sincerely delight in the waltz.

In the end he carries it off flawlessly, a magnificent performance in every sense.",1229558400,6,2019,4.6525423728813555

3303453,5,B0011UY65I,"In my opinion, Live in Vienna and Home Coming are his best Videos. The two songs I like best are Wien,du Stadt Meiner Traume(Vienna,City and My Dreams) and ""Lippen schweigen"" from the Merry Widow.",1227312000,,196,4.794117647058823
3303454,5,B0011UY65I,"Tastes are, of course, subjective, but, in my opinion, ""Live in Vienna"" is far and away the best concert ever performed by Andre' Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra. (My second favorite would be ""At the Schoennbrunn"" - Andre' is always at his best performing in the Land of Strauss).

I first saw this concert advertiesed by my local PBS channel during one of their fund drives and assumed that it was one I had already seen (after all, he has certainly performed in Vienna enough times.) Much to my pleasant surprise the very first selection. Vienna Citizens"" was a waltz I had not heard in 20 years and I had never heard performed by Andre' Rieu. I remembered it as one of my all time favorite ""Strauss waltzes"" Imagine my chagrin when I subsequently discovered that it had been composed by Carl Michael Ziehrer, a younger contemporary of Johann Straus II. Oh well, it's a beautiful waltz anyway.

Early on a number of young ladies in evening gowns and young men in ""Hapsburg"" uniforms performed a visually beautiful ""Fledermaus Quadrille"" in the sumptious ballrooms of the Imperial Apartments. Thirty years ago my late wife and I went to Vienna and saw what may have been the precursors to this group. It certainmly brought back pleasant memories. This was followed by more waltz music including the ""Gold and Silver Waltz by Lehar (another one on my favorites.)

A change of pace was introduced at this point with a Mozart medley during which the orchestra mirthfully played a few bars of that well known Mozart melody ""Twinkle, Twinkle
Little Star"" while a large portrait of Mozart ""winked"" at the audience. Most impressive during the Mozart segment was the piano solo by a lovely young pianist whose keyboard stylings
were surehanded as well as delicate. I imagined that she played it pretty much the way that Mozart wanted it played.

After Mozart we returned to Strauss and his most famous operetta ""Die Fledermaus."" My favorite Andre Rieu vocalist, Carla Maffioletti, always bursting with personality, gave us
her lovingly flirtatious rendition of ""The Laughing Song"" (you guessed it - one of my favorites). There are fewer more pleasurable events in the musical world than watching
and listening to Carla Maffioletti in action.

As I said at the olutset tastes are subjective and my reasons for giving this DVD five stars is very subjective. How could I give anything less to a DVD that is nothing less than a non-stop rendition of all my favorite melodies. In addition to those mentioned I'll just list ""The Merry ""Widow,"" ""Treasure"" waltz, ""Morning Papers"" waltz and the hauntingly beautiful ""Vienna, City of My Dreams.""

The usual cast of Andre Rieu characters are present here including vocalists Karl Moik, The Platin Tenors, Carmen Monarcha, the lovely Suzanne Ehrens, Roger the trumpet player, the fellow who does tricks with his trombone, the pretty blonde cellist who always looks like she's having the time of her life, and, of course, the great Andre' Rieu himself.",1225584000,29,2989,4.908910891089109
3303455,5,B0011UY65I,"My wife and I have enjoyed viewing this DVD production very much.  We watched it again last night.  The music is excellent.  The staging is excellent, set in the site of the Vienna palace.  The ""debutante couples"" waltzing on stage and in the Emperor's Ballroom, additional dancers from the Vienna Ballet and Folk Dance Group, scenes from Vienna and Austria, great performances by singers Carla Mafioletti, Carmen Monarcha, Susan Erens, and the Australian Marusia (I didn't get her last name) add to the orchestal excellence of the Johann Strauss Orchestra.

3303457,5,B0011UY65I,"I recieved this newly released DVD (30 Sept 2008) as a pleasant surprise gift from a very good friend of mine(EC)who also caught the virus of classical music being spread worldwide by Andre Rieu.

Overall,compared with previous Andre's Concert DVD's,there is a marked increase of the usual elegance and finesse in the innovated presentation of Andre Rieu being accompanied by the Johann Strauss orchestra and choir. It is more apparent when we consider the concert is being held in Vienna, the home of the Strauss family and the birthplace of the waltz.

The stage is set up in Michaeler Square on the doorsteps(literally) of the Imperial Hofburg Palace in Vienna city center. A big 'Bravo' to the Stage Designer Marianne & Johny Lochner for their innovation about setting up two dance floors,one on each side of the orchestra bay. An extension of the dance floors is inside the original magnificent dance floor of the Imperial Hofburg Palace with its numerous classical chandeliers. This latter is shown on widescreens provided for the spectators. As expected, the inside ballroom of the palace displays all the sumptuous splendour and grandeur as it did in the 19th Century when Johann Strauss was teaching the world and Queen Victoria to waltz!

The performers on the dance floors are the outstanding Ballet group of The Vienna State Opera, Thomas Elmeyer group of Debutante Couples and the Folk Opera group of Vienna. In the various appropriate traditional costumes they open the show/concert with  a pre-Strauss era ,Church approved 'strict' Quadrille formation dancing  which easily  transport the spectators to the time and place.

 Andre's brief historical account of how the Waltz caused 'all hell to break loose' and 'stormed the world' has his usually witty sense of humour.

 The repertoire, once again , has been very carefully and appropriately chosen to reflect the time and place with the usual high standard. The first waltz is the 'Gold and Silver Waltz' which gives us an almost complete reconstruction of the original time and place when it was composed and played thereafter.

 Throughout the concert/show the same standard is meticulously maintained.
The soloists adapt beautifully to that era. The manner in which Carmen,Carla and Suzan thank the audience has innovated in a more elegant way that belongs to that time. The Australian newcomer Mirusia has joined the group very smoothly . The new hairstyle of the soloists and members of the orchestra perhaps appear to be more suited for the 2007 midsummer one(the date of the concert) rather than one of that time.

 I must accept that I fail to understand the short Moulin Rouge type of show at the end of The Platin's Tenors and The Soloists fantastic and serious interpretation from 'The Merry Widow'. Somehow I feel that these latter might not have felt at ease as they were still on stage.

 Suzan Erens is ,once again, fabulous in her interpretation of 'Sound of Music ' which is a tribute to Austria where the movie was made in the midst of its breathtaking sceneries in the valleys of the Alps.

 Carmen Monarcha's interpretation of 'Meine Lippen sie Kussen so heiss' displays an outstandingly perfect inovated stage show. She excels and surpasses herself with  a high degree of impressive perfection. She very well deserves the standing ovation she gets from the orchestra,Andre and the audience.

 The interpretation of 'The Waltz of All Waltzes' took  new higher dimensions with the waltzing ( Floating and swaying) of the dancers on the dance floors on the sides of the orchestra bay. The costumes of Elmeyer's dancing group 'Debutante Couples' are perfectly appropriate and they manage the cheeky hesitation beats of Andre Rieu very well. They are outstanding again in 'Morgen bluner'.It is a pity that M.Krammer( the main cameraman) did not give us more wideangle views, from 60 degrees above the horizontal specially that the DVD is excellent in the 16:9 format. I feel we had too many closeups views and not enough of the orchestra together with the two dance floors.

 With Andre's touch of humour he gets Thomas Elmeyer to issue an anti aging and increasing longetivity prescription to all concerned!

 The usual cheerful,lively and joyful feeling among the members of the orchestra and choir and, of course, Andre's become contagious and overcome the spectators who joins in a swaying frenzy throughout and,more so,towards the end of the show.

 The guest artist Dagmer Koller lives up very well to her name of 'La Grande Dame de Vienne' in her interpretation of 'Vienna,City of My Dreams'. She joins in the grande finale 'Adieu,mein kliner Gardeoffizier'.

 There is a banner in the audience that summarises this very successful Concert/Show appropriately .It shows a picture of Andre and it reads ""DON'T STOP"". At least we have it for 135 minutes on DVD(containing extra tracks not shown on public television).

 So enjoy it again and again....",1224633600,38,4939,5.044334975369458

3303459,5,B0011UY65I,"This is a 2007 mid-summer concert which took place in front of imperial Hofburg Palace in the center of Vienna.

DVD (DVD9) is in Widescreen (16:9) format with DD5.1 and DD2.0 sound option. Andre Rieu speaks in German but subtitles are available. Main feature runs for 135mins. There are no extra features.

Playlist selection is wonderful with 25 classical hits. Some of them we know from other DVDs of Rieu, but there are some new pieces we will hear in this DVD. There are waltzes, polkas, arias and musical pieces. According to me highlights are All Strauss Waltzes, Eine kleine Nachtmusik (Mozart Medley), The Sound of Music, and Arias. The Johann Strauss Orchestra is accompanied by Choir and joined by guest stars namely The Platine Tenors, Dogmar Koller, Carmen Monarcha, Carla Maffioletti, Mirusia Louwerse and Suzan Erens. They all have wonderful performances. Also the Ballet of the Vienna State Opera, the Vienna debutantes from the Elmayer Dance School joins the Viennese ambient with their waltzes.

One of the best of Andre Rieu's (according to me the other bests are Homecoming and the Schonbrunn Concerts). Especially if you love the waltzing themes, this one is for you with lots of waltzes in the heart of waltz-capital of Europe, Vienna. You will enjoy a real Viennese Night in your homes.

Andre, she's amazing and you hide her up there almost out of sight! Fie!  I would love to hear her play Claire de Lune.

So last week we finally got his CD from the public library totally unbiased and listened to it.
We are both Strauss fans and love the Strauss waltzes from the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

We listened to the first waltz on the Rieu CD (On the beautiful blue Danube) and shook our heads. What happened to this once so lovely and energetic waltz? This sounded as if a 3 man band played it. Waltzes HAVE to be played by a huge orchestra in order to sound right!!! This is not what Strauss had on his mind when he composed his waltzes.

Well, we listened to a few more waltzes (Voices of Spring is usually my favorite waltz), but with every new song we got the feeling, we heard the previous song. Totally uninspired music. There was absolutely no difference between each waltz. Very repetitive.
A small chamber orchestra really shouldn't play waltzes.
If I could give zero stars, I would have done it.
This kind of music is an affront/insult to every waltz lover!",1339372800,5,1181,4.509345794392523

3303524,5,B0011UY65I,"Another great Andre Rieu DVD, thus 5 stars. But why does he limit his repertoire? We all love Lehar and Strauss but there were other composers of light Viennese music? Has Andre ever heard of Karl Ziehrer, Leo Fall, Heinrich Reinhardt, Leon Jessel or any other not to famous composers? And what about Oskar Nedbal, though Czech, who wrote such glorious music in the same vein? He lets Lehar and Strauss drown almost everything else. Hopefully this will someday change as he could do do much for minor composers.

Possibly he may also discover Victor Herbert, whose delightful American music has been forgotten by even American conductors. Herbert and Rieu were made for each other. If only they were acquainted.",1268006400,,711,4.925
3303525,5,B0011UY65I,"'Andre Rieu: Live from Vienna' is, without question, one of the most outstanding Andre concerts I've had the privilege to watch.

The setting is the plaza in front of the beautiful Hofburg Palace in central Vienna. Recorded on a quiet, beautiful and warm (audience and ladies of the orchestra in bare shoulders) summer evening; a perfect set of conditions for a concert such as this.

First, the technical:

It's hard to imagine all the technical and logistical happenings that had to occur to make this evening a success. The plaza had a false floor inserted for seating accommodations and traffic was apparently rerouted around the area for a week in advance of the concert to allow the structural changes needed in the plaza to occur. The lighting, cameras were all perfectly placed, helping give that subtle, wonderful ambiance to the evening as night gradually overtook the concert.

Then there was the coordination of the different concert elements...the orchestral, the costumes, the dancers. The number of rehearsals and the amount of time involved must have been staggering to get a concert of this size and magnitude to come off without an apparent hitch (even though I realize the final DVD product probably received major editing.

I also like the candid shots of the audience...some caught singing, dancing and just generally enjoying themselves; and oh yes, there was the occasional tear.

Second, the performance:

The concert program featured several of Vienna's (plus surrounding areas) own historically prominent musicians; the most famous being Johann Strauss and W. A. Mozart, just to mention two. In fact the theme of the night was predominantly Strauss waltzes. One great melody after another, enhanced by the wonderful locale, costumes, players and dancers.

But, more than just the setting and the music, the intangible quality that sets Andre Rieu's shows apart, is the obvious and sincere fun everyone on stage is having during the performance. And make no mistake about it, no one is having more fun than Andre, and this attitude seems to radiate from him and infects the rest of his cast. A joy to watch, as well as hear.

Conclusion:

A stunning DVD. Filled with all the pomp and pageantry that gives the viewer a small glimpse of what the old Austrian empire must have been like at its zenith, when it was considered to be the cultural center of the world.

A couple of things regarding Andre Rieu.
A tip of the hat for his foresight and perseverance to pull a show like this off; the worries and concerns must have been enormous, but you'd never know it to watch him on-stage.  Always smiling and directing his charges with a smile,  a look , an eyebrow or a stroke of his bow...all with the confidence of the consummate professional.

Three personal favorite moments (from many):

1.)Andre's short solo performance of the violin sonata/concerto during the Mozart medley.
2.)Carla Maffioletti's 'Mein Herr Marquis' from Stauss's 'Die Fledermaus'.
3.)The ballet by the Vienna Ballet and Folk Dance group of 'Ganz onhe Weiber geht die Chose nicht' from 'The Gypsy Princess'. (stunning costumes that flowed and moved perfectly with the music)

Ray Nicholson

P.S.
And for all that I loved this performance, it still comes in second place among all other Andre Rieu's DVDs. My favorite is the show from Tuscany, Italy...a smaller, more intimate setting that oozes unbridled joy and spontaneity.",1266105600,,3421,5.0265486725663715

3303539,5,B0011UY65I,"In my opinion this video rates in the same class as The Homecoming, that is to say one of his best efforts.

The setting, in front of the Imperial Palace is splendid.  The sound and video work is superlative, as always.

In this video one can see a more mature set of singers, their voices and manners even more accomplished.  The two ladies from Brazil have always been wonderful performers, but here they display a more refined and effusive delivery.  Besides those two there are other singers, including some from Austria, who add color and luster to an already outstanding effort.

One is treated to dancers as well, in period costume and dancing in the imperial palace!  A visual treat to say the least; radiant Austrian girls, stunning in their lovely ball gowns and accompanied by gallant gentlemen.  Breathtaking!

At the beginning one can note a hint of tension in Andre as he comes on stage and addresses the musicians.  Clearly he is playing the  worldwide capital of music, and the very soul of Austria is going to judge his efforts. The mayor of the city is in attendance and the audience is critical to say the least.

In addition, he alludes briefly during his comments to having had to block traffic in one of the most crowded areas of the city, and the problems that caused him and his people.  So certainly there is good reason for his tension.

The listeners are more jaded here, the music of Strauss runs in their veins.  It would take a superlative performance just to satisfy them, let alone genuinely impress.  So ones sees a more reserved audience than is normal in his other videos.  However, by the end of the tape he has even those people standing, a real tribute to a master showman!

I cannot recommend this video more highly, it is not a simple duplicate of previous music in a different setting, it is a totally new effort,with new songs, different singers and dancers who sincerely delight in the waltz.

In the end he carries it off flawlessly, a magnificent performance in every sense.",1229558400,6,2019,4.6525423728813555
