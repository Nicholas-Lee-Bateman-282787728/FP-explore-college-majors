2560255,5,B000FBWDC2,"This movie is the ""BOMB"".
For me, brings back memories of the early 80's, Sunday mornings they would play Kung Fu Movies.

This is a classic.
Great entertainment.",1304467200,,162,4.785714285714286
2560256,5,B000FBWDC2,"This movie has good dialogue and an excellent plot, and as part of that plot has an organized competition a la Karate Kid or Bloodsport which is as cool as that one from that movie which I wish I could remember where guys from all countries come together to compete and then the one guy from India comes strutting in playing the recorder type thing before he declares that he is going to kick a$$ all around, and besides all of that it has great kung fu.  So you can judge my tastes, I also like Shaolin Temple Against Lama, Iron Monkey, Wheels on Meals, and Fist of Legend.  I have seen a lot of kung fu movies, and this movie is among the best, upper ninety five percentile, of all kung fu movies.  Maybe it's not Citizen Kane, but the director understood that the viewer wants to see action and not BS.  Two bucks at the thrift store.",1279065600,,837,4.245283018867925
2560257,1,B000FBWDC2,"This is an illegal bootleg DVD, check out the offical release ""Heroes of the East"" the movie is excellent but we need to support the offical releases of the Shaw Brothers classics not these cheap bootlegs.",1225238400,8,205,4.722222222222222
2560258,3,B000FBWDC2,"Nice family film, which is rare for a flick from this genre. I would definitely recommend it. The storyline can be applied to in modern kungfu films of today.",1200787200,,158,4.482758620689655
2560259,5,B000FBWDC2,"I'm not a man of many words, so I don't think I'll say too much.  But not enough can be said about this awesome martial arts flick!  First of all, it stars Gordon Liu, whose martial arts career rivals that of Jackie Chan.  Second it is a fantanstic display of the differences between Chinese and Japanese martial arts.  It's got jian (straight sword) versus katana, butterfly swords versus sai, karate versus zui quan (drunken fist), and an awesome confrontation between Chinese kung fu and ninja!

Some might call the plot weak, but I've seen weaker.  Besides, it's usually not about the plot, but the kung fu fights, in which case this film is excellent.",1199232000,,656,4.7105263157894735
2560260,4,B000FBWDC2,"What's refreshing about this movie is that its sense of humor transcends culture and geography.  I can deal with the fact that kung fu films are just an extension of the Chinese Opera, but often the humor doesn't translate.  Then again, I find most modern American comedies anything but funny.  And let's look at American martial arts flicks.  No, I'm not gonna do that.  Blecchh!

Gordon Liu is arranged to be married to a Japanese woman, which he ain't thrilled about until he sees how pretty she is.  So he goes through with it and all is well until they start debating on the superiority of Chinese or Japanese styles.  Eventually they spar and Gordo wins.  She goes back to Japan and he issues her a challenge to try and get her to return.  Unfortunately the letter is intercepted by some of her superiors thinking he is challenging them and insulting their martial arts.

A group of Japanese fighters soon show up on Gordon's door looking for a rumble.  He has to fight one a day until he is defeated or takes them all out.  Not an easy task, even for an expert.

There are some great and inventive fights in this movie.  And each one is different from the last as he has to use a different style and/or weapon for each of his opponents.

A beautiful, restored DVD only adds to the excitement of owning this movie.  Colorful in picture, humor, and style.  This is quite a bit different than most Shaw Brothers movies I've seen and is recommended.

1978.  aka:  Heroes of the East; Challenge of the Ninja",1195862400,4,1509,4.4944649446494465
2560261,4,B000FBWDC2,"All the reviews listed here say it very well.  This movie portrays the mythos between Japanese and Chinese fighting very well.  It compares and contrasts them through the discovery between a newly wed husband and wife.  It is playful and humorous in spots, without being the least corny.  It is one of my favorite Shaw releases.  If you are trying to get your girlfriend to watch old school kung fu, start with this one.  If you have a girl that likes kung fu, she's a keeper.  If you are a single girl that likes kung fu..... how YOU doin'?  Anywho, the Japanese wife who is skilled in martial arts and playful with it early in the movie will appeal to the female gender.

The Red Sun release is a little sketchy.  As stated in another review, this dvd has original language with subtitles, even though my dvd cover says english language with no subtitles.  Color reproduction and sharpness are fairly good.  Also, my dvd wouldn't work in one player, but did in another.  For the money, and to have original language, I am most pleased though.",1193616000,,1044,4.548387096774194
2560262,5,B000FBWDC2,"Apples vs. oranges, Chevy vs. Ford, Yankees vs. Red Sox, vanilla vs. chocolate... all great debates to be sure, but they pale in comparison to the best debate of them all, Chinese Martial Arts vs. Japanese Martial Arts!  This Lau Kar-Leung (who also appears as a drunken master!) film, also known by the much better title, ""Heroes of the East,"" delivers this battle in fantastic fashion with tons of style and charm to spare.  The plot has Gordon Liu in an arranged marriage to Japanese actress Yuko Mizuno and instantly their cultures and beliefs clash, most importantly when it comes to just who has the best fighting techniques the world over.  In typical Kar-Leung film fashion the movie has a light playful tone, however; unlike some of his other attempts it's never corny and obnoxious and Gordon and Yuko in particular have fun with the situations while still keeping a serious tone about everything.  The Japanese masters that are brought in to challenge Gordon are all great and bring personality and flavor with the small amount of screen time each is given (by actual Japanese actors).  When these duels occur we get everything you could ever hope for including Kung Fu vs. Karate, Long Sword vs. Kitana, Butterfly Knives vs. Sais, 3 Section Staff vs. Nunchuku (in the closest we'll ever get to seeing Liu take on Bruce Lee... and this guy is an obvious clone), and more!  One knock I do have with the movie is that Chinese master Liu tends to pawn the Japanese masters in exciting but fairly one-sided duels.  Still, this is a Chinese film (if it was Japanese I'm sure things would be quite the opposite) and the Japanese masters are all treated respectfully even in defeat.  This is a top 10 martial arts movie for myself and many other fans of Kung Fu cinema so if you haven't seen this yet then do yourself a favor and check it out ASAP!  As far as the DVD by bargain-bin bootleg company Red Sun goes, it looks unbelievably good in a crisp, clean widescreen presentation and comes with 2 language tracks (original and English dub... the dub has a pretty solid hissing behind it) and can be bought for next to nothing.  That being said I advise buying this only if you have never seen it and until Image or another respectable company rereleases it... then crush this bootleg copy with a rock (means of destruction completely up to you.  The rock is just a sugestion LOL!).",1192406400,5,2387,4.646080760095012
2560263,4,B000FBWDC2,"This flick definately reflects Gordon Liu in a positive light since ""The Master Killer"".  I thought his flick was a great old school story,,,very entertaining.  This flick was directed by the great Leung Kar Yan, one of his best production,,no question.  Definately a must see,,really great movie!!",1152662400,4,298,5.297872340425532
2560264,5,B000FBWDC2,"If you know kung fu films then you must know Gordon Liu, and this is one of my favorite movies of his. Gordon Liu is an awesome martial artist. In this film he demonstrate many martial arts techniques such a drunken boxing and other kung fu styles. In this movie Gordon Liu is forced to marry a Japanese woman who is skilled and proud of her Japenese fighting skills and customs. This couple eventually quarrells over whos style is better. The Japenese wife's masters come from Japan to teach Gordon Liu a lesson. A beautiful display of spear, sword, staff, Judo, karete, ninjitsu, and other fighting styles are displayed. The movie is english dubbed, and the option of clear subtitles is available. The movie is digitally restored so it is fairly clear when compared to other old school kung fu films. Simply, buy this movie if you enjoy good kung fu movies, a must have for all fans!!",1149465600,13,886,4.613924050632911

again. If you enjoy classical matial arts films, you will love this one.",1400198400,,198,4.2368421052631575
8120527,5,B000FBWDC2,"I my opinion, this is the best film that Gordon Liu ever made. Sure I liked the 36 chambers but this movie is deep.
The story is a typical clash of cultures when the son of a Chinese business man is arranged to marry the daughter of his Japanese business partner. What is lost in the english translation is the language barrier, duh... But I am getting ahead of the story. The two happily marry, but not long after, the cultural differences that were apparent at the wedding cause the two love birds to compare who's fighting style is better. (Gordon: Whoa, my wife is a black belt in karate, darned arranged marriages, why didn't anyone tell me! Good thing I am Kung-Fu at fighting.)

He loves is beautiful wife who is also a very good martial artist (no stunt double) but she is stubborn and goes back home to Japan where a misunderstanding (you think...) causes seven Japanese masters to show up at the husbands door and the Epic battles begin!

Once again I have to mention that what is lost in the english translation is the fact the there is a language barrier between the Japanese masters and Gordon's character with the exception of his wife.

(this writer assures that no one was killed in the story of this film)

This is the exact same film as ""Heroes of the East,"" I know, I have both. the latter title has some bonus features that SvN does not. Either way this movie gets my HIGHLY RECOMMENDED rating!",1377734400,,1414,4.4689922480620154
8120528,5,B000FBWDC2,"I love these movies.  I use to watch Kung Fu Theatre every Saturday Afternoon as a boy.  I remember the 5 Fingers of Death, Five Deadly Venoms and the Challenge of the Ninja.  The latter is the best in my opinion.  Chinese versus Japanese fighting styles...classic movie.  One of the greatest martial arts movie ever made.",1363564800,,322,4.678571428571429
