1173011,5,9089700579,"This DVD is great! I love the visuals, sound effects & music. I appreciate that you can choose music, sound effects or both. The images of the koi are clear. You get all the benefits of a koi pond without the space or effort!",1393459200,,225,4.136363636363637
1173012,5,9089700579,"If you need to relax or perhaps lower high blood pressure, this video is for you. It is pure relaxation and absolutely beautiful. Just sit back and watch the most amazing koi fish swimming peacefully and oh so tranquil in their lovely pond enclosure. You can watch them while listening to gorgeous oriental music which fits perfectly with the theme or you can enjoy the natural noises from the pond and/or waterfall. I love this! I highly recommend this very elegant dvd to all...:)",1387843200,,482,4.75
1173013,5,9089700579,"I have this DVD and I love it! Within 5 minutes you are transported to a Japanese Koi Fish Pond.. The water sounds(including fish splashing and insects, birds  in the background) sooth's your soul and calms your mind. Just let go and feel your stress melt away! Very tranquil and meditative.....",1382745600,2,295,4.784313725490196
1173014,5,9089700579,"Koi are both highly social and intelligent, so they are a lot of fun to watch.  Aquariums are artificial and cramped, and even in the videos, the behavior of the fish reflect that.  I love this pond video not just for its lush and relaxing location in a Zen garden, but because the fish are relaxed and happy.

There is a scenic choice of numerous angles of the pond, plus footage where you only see fish and water.  The colorful fish are close up and personal, and over time you come to recognize favorites-nice to see freshwater fish for a change instead of those exotic tropical ones.  No humans in sight, with just a hint of garden architecture.

The audio offers two music tracks and one ""pond sounds"" track (my favorite) complete with gurgles, soft waterfalls, and fishy splashes.

Totally relaxing and SO much easier then aquarium upkeep.",1249084800,2,845,4.668918918918919

1173017,4,9089700579,"Koi Fish pond DVD was what I expected, beautiful scenery with koi and nice music. Nice to play as background entertainment while having a Koi club meeting at my home. Played with and without music (just pond sounds). everyone loved the different koi that were shown.",1424044800,,266,4.804347826086956
1173018,5,9089700579,"I'm not sure where to even begin to give praise to this product. The colors are vivid, the clarity excels, and I am amazed how perfectly the water sounds go with the activity of these fish.  I feel particularly blessed to have this DVD, because I often have difficulty falling asleep. Now I can just turn this DVD on and it lulls me to sleep.  My recommendation is a definite ""thumbs up!""",1418860800,,388,4.375
1173019,5,9089700579,This Koi Pond DVD is fantastic!  It has music but my choice for this particular DVD is always the water sounds.  Amazing scenes where the Koi fill up the entire screen or you can choose a pond scene where you get greenery and the outdoors along with the Koi.  I would recommend this DVD!,1415664000,,287,4.277777777777778
1173020,5,9089700579,"I have always loved Koi fish and this DVD is exceptional!  There are so many films and changing images on this disc.  The ponds are exquisite and have the most beautiful vivid colored Koi.  In a few of the tracks, the Koi are so large.  I had never realized before how big they actually get.  You get very up-close scenes as well as distance which also shows the elegant gardens.  Excellent DVD!  A must have!!!",1414022400,,411,4.4
1173021,5,9089700579,Very nice!!!,1410220800,,12,5.5
1173022,5,9089700579,"This Koi video shows you up close the beauty of the koi fish. Unlike other types of fish, these fish meander around slowly so you get to see the beautiful colors and designs on the fish. There are so many different looking fish and it's fascinating to watch them slowly skim the top of the water. There's such a peacefulness to them that it's hard not to get so relaxed you almost drift off. The sounds of the water enhances this video too - I really prefer nature sounds over music almost all the time. It's like you're right there and seeing them in person. This is a wonderful video if you're interested in Koi fish. I highly doubt you'd be disappointed in it. The photography, as usual with Tony Helsloot's videos, is outstanding. All in all, this video is definitely a keeper.",1402099200,,781,4.468531468531468

1173024,5,9089700579,"I enjoy playing these nature DVD's while reading; and this is my new favorite.  So relaxing.  I find this one absolutely hypnotic. Read a little, watch the koi a little.  Personally I enjoy listening to the water sounds, I don't listen to the music so can't comment on that.  I only put it in and start reading when I know I have time to doze off and take a little nap. Just bought another one to give to my mother.",1397520000,,415,4.15
1173025,5,9089700579,"this is great close up view of koi swimming, you can watch with no sound, water sound, with 2 music choices, and more than one video choices. I think it would be great with dim lighting with a special someone, just leave on if you have some people over, I think kids would like it (babysit), and of course cats would love it. great buy.",1396828800,,336,4.184615384615385
7901636,5,9089700579,This CD has to be the best depiction of a real koi pond and having the relaxing sounds to go with it are ideal for relaxation and meditation. I highly recommend it.,1497571200,,164,4.15625

7901644,5,9089700579,"This DVD offers you several options for sound effects ( music (kind of a relaxing generic Asian-sounding music), water sounds, both, or no sound) and scenes allowing you to pick out what you like best and make up your ""best case scenario"" relaxation video. There are natural pond scenes and some scenes looking down on fish with just a plain blue background.  They are different enough that I can imagine someone having a preference.  The video has koi of every shape and color.  If you have a favorite, just wait.  It will swim by eventually.  The video is really quite mesmerizing and runs on a loop.",1442275200,3,602,4.6415094339622645
