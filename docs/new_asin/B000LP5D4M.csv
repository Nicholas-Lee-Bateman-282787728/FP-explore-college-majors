8162832,4,B000LP5D4M,"I give this only **** 4 stars because most of these have already been released on DVD restored from 35mm.  There is little new here.

The thought is that Kids won't watch B&W movies, so lets colorize The Little Rascals/Our Gang.  Purists will be glad that they can watch these in their original B&W, which is good since the colorization looks cartoony & unnatural.

The title of this set is a little mis-leading, some of the better Spanky comedies are on the other colorized DVDs from this distributor.

I just could not pass up the extras that are included on these DVDs.

BEST OF SPANKY has
General Spanky Trailer,
Home Movies of Spanky wrestling with a boy ( possibly his stand-in ),
Speedo Bike Commercial,
Clip from Peck's Bad Boy.

Oh, yes.. there are the comedy shorts.  These are all from 35mm 1950's RE-ISSUE PRINTS, not the same MGM transfers as the Cabin Fever / Hallmark DVDs.  But they are 35mm prints and they look very good.  There is a variety of title sections representing almost every company that re-issued these shorts in 35mm, including Official Films which I never knew made 35mm prints.

BEST OF SPANKY
""LITTLE RASCALS FOLLIES"" - Monogram titles - Originally titles Our Gang Follies of 1936, the gang puts on a show.

""WASHEE IRONEE"" - Official 'Famous Kids' titles - The gang starts their own laundry service.  While the title is politically incorrect today, the short has few jokes that wouldn't be acceptable.  So this one can be enjoyed by all.

""SHRIMPS FOR A DAY"" - Monogram titles - This fantasy story has a rich couple finding a magic lamp and wishing they were kids again. Their wish backfires as they are mistaken for orphans and are forced to join Spanky & the gang at the orphanage run by a mean miser.  The truth eventually comes out with a happy ending.

""CHOO CHOO"" - Official 'Famous Kids' titles - An early Spank entry, back when he was a little face-punching brat. Children could pick up some bad behaviors watching this, but it is great fun for adults.  The gang brings havoc to an overnight train ride.

""NIGHT 'N' GALES "" - Official 'Famous Kids' titles (1st time on DVD?) - ""Oh, mama..."" cries Darla's Dad when Alfalfa, Buckwheat, & Porky come over for a visit with music in their hands.  A timeless classic.

The shorts are offered in both Colorized & original B&W restored versions, but switching back & forth while playing the short is not possible.  The bonus material is B&W only.",1170979200,6,2431,4.630841121495327
