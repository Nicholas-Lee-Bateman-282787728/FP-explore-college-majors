8326730,4,B001NFNS6O,"The story is snappy with lots of intrigue and spies listening in closets.  Our enjoyment now is ruined by poor sound and visuals, plus an odd intervention at the climax, apparently by the studio itself.  In the original theatrical release (and according to historical accounts), Robespierre was sentenced to death by the assembly because he couldn't get his hands on the bell that by tradition was handed from speaker to speaker in orderly fashion, entitling the new person to take the floor to speak.  In this crucial instance, the bell was tossed back and forth across the room over the heads of the delegates, with Robespierre chasing it around the hall in vain and deprived of the opportunity to intimidate from the podium.  In the end, it became a spectacle with Robespierre looking ridiculous and becoming the target of roaring laughter.  This entire dramatic scene (absolutely made in heaven for a film director of imagination) is excised from my copy and replaced with the most innocuous, flacid, shrug off of the assembly's action, letting the air out of the film's balloon.

When this fine film is remastered, the original ending needs to be located and restored or it's hardly worth the bother.

The 4* are  awarded for the rollicking story & what it can become again after remastering.  Those 4* are meant to encourage a good remaster.  In its present sad state, as it's offered for sale here, it deserves only 1* because of its dilapidated-mutilated condition.",1388534400,,1473,4.9271255060728745

The story begins on July 26, 1794 in Revolutionary France when Maximilien Robespierre was in power, but had his enemies. The Marquis de la Fayette sent an envoy to France. Danton is condemned to death by Robespierre. Did he outlive his usefulness? Can Robespierre become dictator? Du Valle from Strasbourg arrives at an inn. Will he be disturbed? A woman brings a message from Barras. Next Fouchet, the head of the Secret Police, visits him. Robespierre wants his missing black book, a list of enemies who will meet the guillotine. Du Valle must find it in 24 hours, or else. Charles meets Madeline again. The ""Black Book"" can be used against Robespierre. There is a surprising upset to their plans. Will those who could have the ""Black Book"" be silenced? ""Dead enemies make good friends.""

Du Valle visits Barras in prison. The murders were to spread fear and distrust among Barras' party. What will happen when Du Valle's wife arrives in Paris? Will there be a surprise? There is a chase for action. Charles makes a deal with Fouchet, and they search a room for the Black Book in a room full of books. There is fighting, Charles escapes again. But the soldiers search near where he is hidden. They escape from Paris after showing their papers. Soldiers follow to the farm, but they stay hidden. When questioning a young boy St. Just shows his character. There is drama in simply taking a nap! Can they recover the Black Book (which lists Robespierre's enemies) and get away to Paris? Fouchet has a plan to get the Black Book.

The Convention meets with cheering for Robespierre, the Friend of the People. That Black Book is passed around to the representatives, who scan its contents. Whose names are recorded there? This has a revolutionary effect on the representatives, they now oppose Robespierre. Can his rhetoric turn the situation around? No, a shot muffles his voice. Now it is Robespierre's turn to meet the guillotine. Fouchet talks to a soldier. ""I'll try to remember your name.""

This is a very good dramatic story that is based on the events of July 1794 when the reign of Robespierre came to an end. It was followed by a committee or directorate that ruled France. France continued to be threatened by its enemies, the aristocracy that wanted to keep its powers and privileges to exploit people. In time, France was conquered and a king put back on the throne. But the slogans of ""liberty, equality, fraternity"" won the hearts and minds of the people. A good history book will give you the facts behind this movie. [I wonder if this story reflected the concerns of 1949 America? Were there those who spoke against past politicians to gain power and privileges for their selfish interests.]
This film was also titled ""The Black Book"".",1300060800,,2777,4.767151767151767
8326732,2,B001NFNS6O,"This film is well acted,photographed (John Alton) and directed. The transfer is horrendous. This is the reason I can only give this DVD two stars. This film should be re-mastered. I would purchase it again if this were ever done. The plot is very interesting as it concerns the French Revolution as Film Noir. Great script,snappy dialogue.",1208995200,4,339,4.964912280701754
8326733,2,B001NFNS6O,"This film (a.k.a. ""Black Book"") is good and very interesting for many reasons: direction (great Anthony Mann), actors (Richard Basehart and special mention for one of my favorites: Charles McGraw), photography (wonderful John Alton) and artistic direction (E.I. Ilou and W.C. Menzies), among others. I recommend the film but this copy do not respect de original ratio of photogram: the true format it is 1:37. The image it is deformed because Reel Classics Films print a copy in panoramic format!!. Best regards.",1200268800,7,512,5.2560975609756095
