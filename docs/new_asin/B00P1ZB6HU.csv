8686147,2,B00P1ZB6HU,"My review is about this new 10-DVD set, currently priced at $39.99 here on amazon, rather than about the series itself. My 2-star rating is because this premium-priced set is not a good buy considering the video quality and packaging. The series itself would warrant 5 stars.

This is the most expensive set of the complete series ever issued on DVD. The company is Topics Entertainment, which is promoting this set as being ""Remastered for Best Quality"", plus the 39 episodes are spread out over 10 DVDs. I've bought about 6 sets of episodes from this series over the past decade from Madacy, Mill Creek, Pop Flix and Platinum/Echo Bridge, all budget priced before this set, trying to find one with  better video quality.  Some of the releases have packed the entire 39 episodes onto as few as three DVDs, which is too much compression, especially for old film prints that have never been good video quality in the first place.  ALL of these releases (including this new one) are sourced from the same set of film prints.  Based on the ""Remastered"" claim, the 10 DVDs, and that this was released by a different company than those that issued the series previously, I had high hopes that we would finally see a significant improvement in video quality over everything that has been issued before.

1)-VIDEO QUALITY AND CONTENT:

The good news is that some of the episodes on this set are slightly better quality than the prior releases from the other companies.

Most of the episodes are acceptable, some remain poor quality. The opening titles and some of the episodes also have some pixel/image shifting. Some episodes look like there is a light screen over the video. This company may have made some adjustments when transferring the video or film prints to  DVD to brighten them up a bit, but the claim the episodes are ""remastered"" doesn't  live up to what you would expect based on that term, and definitely doesn't mean ""restored"".

Also the company's claim these are ""complete"" episodes is not exactly true. The alternative piano version title theme music for ""The Case of Harry Crocker"" is absent, and replaced with the standard theme. To the company's credit, it appears they looked for a slightly better opening title sequence from one of the episodes and duplicated it onto all the other 38 episodes. But it is too bad that they thoughtlessly removed the unique variation on the opening theme music for ""Harry Crocker"". There may be other missing parts, it seems to me most all the episodes had the spoken mid-show return from the commercial break, ""We now return to the Case of the...."" but I've only seen that on several episodes on this set.

2): DVD PACKAGING/CASE:

The DVD packaging is poor. The long flat rectangular outer box can't be placed alongside your other DVDs on a shelf, but you can remove the inner two DVD cases and discard the outer box.  The long box reminds me of those ""deluxe collector's DVD gift sets"" of old public domain western TV shows and World War II newsreel footage and the like that are sold during the holidays at discount retailers, which ""black Friday"" shoppers grab as an obligatory gift for dad or uncle Joe, and seldom get played by the recipients due to the poor quality.

The two DVD cases each hold 5 DVDs stacked on a single center hub, and the hub is extremely tight on the discs - it's VERY difficult to remove a disc from the hub without needing to pry it out, and you will usually need to pry several out to find the one you want. And I mean PRY, it's that difficult to remove a disc from the hub, I've never had this much difficulty removing a disc from a case. Completely bad packaging, and for the high price of the set you'd think the company could have provided a quality disc holding package.

3): SUMMARY:

The question as to whether or not this set from Topics Entertainment is worth paying a premium price of $39.99 is answered NO for most buyers.

It's very overpriced for the minor improvement of some of the episodes, and the bad DVD box and cases is consumer unfriendly and further discounts its value.  If the price eventually is reduced to $19.99, then it would be worth the money.  But the bottom line is that it's simply not worth paying a premium price for this set of old black and white public domain videos, as it's not premium quality. You are better off just staying with one of the much cheaper sets from one of the other companies.

4): RECOMMENDATION:

You can find the entire series on DVD sets for under $12.00 here on amazon. Try to pick one that has at least 4 one-sided DVDs, that way the video is less compressed.  The POP FLIX company's set on 4 DVDs is a reasonable choice, it's not good video quality either, but seems just a hair better than the Madacy and Mill Creek releases and will get you by. The PLATINUM/ECHO BRIDGE company also has released several sets of episodes that may be a better pick than the frequently issued Madacy and Mill Creek sets.

Hopefully one of the companies will eventually locate original prints or better film sources for this excellent TV series and give them a decent release, which this show deserves. Until then, we're stuck with the same poor video quality on all these releases.",1430352000,15,5211,4.63300760043431
