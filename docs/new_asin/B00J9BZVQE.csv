6340106,5,B00J9BZVQE,Best TV show out there!!!!,1411430400,,26,4.4
6340107,5,B00J9BZVQE,my most favorite show of all time.  does not come close to Friends or Seinfeld.,1411344000,2,79,4.266666666666667

6340140,3,B00J9BZVQE,I watch this show and I wonder why it has been on the air so long.  It is not that funny and Sheldon can even get on my nerves and its only a TV show.  I think its OK and only watch it when I can't find anything else.  I guess its nice occasionally because it is not violent or bloody and pretty light harted.  Still I don't understand its appeal to be on for so many seasons.  At least Penny stopped wearing those ridiculous tank tops all the time.  Ha,1522454400,,453,3.923076923076923

I love to see how he was so indifferent towards everything around him then he slowly became a more emotional and mature person why Amy came along. All the other casts continue to be perfect too! Love the plot, love the show, really hope I can get some friends like them too lol.",1518134400,,448,4.22093023255814

6340187,5,B00J9BZVQE,"What can I say. I get more laughs per hour from this show than anything else on TV. I'm not going to analyze it too much for fear I'll quit laughing. I've  always enjoyed sarcasm. Probably not something I should admit, and Sheldon pulls it off so well. All the characters have their moments, and somehow I believe there are a bunch of socially awkward geniuses watching it going HUH ? and analyzing the equations on the chalk boards.
I was one of the few guys in my High School who wrestled and played football and did Gymnastics, and also loves Math and Physics. I get the humor in Big Bang. I hope it stays around a few more seasons.",1511740800,,635,4.291666666666667

6340545,3,B00J9BZVQE,What happened to my fav programme? Did you know that Howard was an engineer?  He only tells us in every episode.  Why does he wear those awful clothes - they look terrible and affect his walk. Why has Bernadette's voice gotten higher and squeakier - it's not funny; it's irritating and she didn't speak that way when she first joined the cast. Most of the time we can't understand a word she says it's just a mumble of squeaks. Aargh. The actress playing Amy is one dimensional and her one tone voice is expressionless. There are some funny moments (the colonisation application),1481414400,,579,4.666666666666667

6340564,3,B00J9BZVQE,"Very disappointed in the ""included with purchase"" digital HD download.  You cannot download this to a computer that does not have a DVD player like they make it sound.  First you have to create an account that you don't want, which entails reading several pages of ""terms of service"" etc., then you need to download an app that you don't want taking up space on your computer, probably doing things you don't want to your machine and data.  Then, and I never got past their TOS, you may possibly be able to download it.  But then I tried one of the other ""services"" that said you could download it, but then they said the code was invalid, so I guess, the first place showed it as used, even though I never even got to a place where it could be downloaded.  In the TOS it says you will be charged a ""locker access charge"" after one year.  That wasted an hour of my life.

On the DVD, the Blue Ray picture is noticeably better than the regular DVD.  I also enjoyed the gag reel that comes on the disk.",1480464000,2,1000,4.253968253968254

6340649,3,B00J9BZVQE,"We are huge Big Bang Theory fans, having watched most of the seasons 2 if not 3 times.  But I feel this show is starting to wane in humor and grow in annoying personalities.  Way back in season 1, Penny was a kind-hearted, innocent character that brought a softness and warmth to the silliness and social ineptitude of the nerd guys.  Most of the jokes and story elements revolved around nerdy activities, from LAN parties to scientific experiments.  This was the heart of the show and why it was so appealing in a time when most TV shows are either crime drama or reality shows.  More female characters were slowly introduced, and for the most part they have added to the show.  Yet for some reason the writers are making each of the characters more whiny, self-entitled, and mean-spirited with time.  The most glaring example is season 8 Penny.  Instead of kind and a little bumbling in an endearing way, she cuts her hair short, shows zero affection or chemistry toward Leonard, and basically becomes a mean, self-centered, ungrateful rich person that somehow forgot she ate the guys' food for free for 7 years.  Bernadette has also become a snippy little creature, for whom the main gag is how cruel and scary she can be.  Amy has slowly morphed from a shy, socially obtuse nerd girl to being really gross in her numerous sexual comments, particularly to Penny.  And I can't fathom the appeal of Raj's new flame.  It seems they just don't know what to do with his character.

All I can say is, I don't like what they have done with the show and the characters.  They need to get back to their roots of geeky humor and situations, and bring a sweetness back to the female characters.  Otherwise we just have yet another sitcom with no distinct flavor.",1475884800,2,1754,4.594855305466238

6340857,3,B00J9BZVQE,"This season was just.. ""EH""
If you go back and watch season 1 compared to Season 8 this season is terrible.  Not to mention Penny looks horrible with short hair.  EW!
OK so, my issue with this season is that they completely change the characters whole personalities.  In real life people DON'T fundamentally change who they are at their very core.  They toned down Howard when they married him off so he is no longer funny in his usual 'creepy' way.  They made Sheldon more 'human' which in turn makes him not funny either.  Raj can talk... big deal.  It was funny that he couldn't without being drunk and now that he can talk normal like everyone else... I wish his character was mute.  Bernadette is funny but really not necessary.  Amy is just... filler.  Lenord (sp) is well... annoying and not even in all of reality would he wind up with a girl like Penny.  Not to mention they made him less of a nerd by being with Penny.  I'll get the next season just because but I think this is where the whole series took a gigantic dive.  You can change scenarios and plots but you can't change who they characters are at their very core.  That is what made it good.  Now its just a disappointment all around.  I can even watch this season because its boring and just status quo for making more money because people liked the other seasons.  That is just My opinion.",1468800000,,1361,4.401606425702811

6340889,4,B00J9BZVQE,"By now we all know what Big Bang Theory is so I can skip the synopsis piece.

To begin - I have watched this show since day one. I have absorbed everything that the crew has to offer and I have grown with the characters on the show. This season, although decent, felt like the characters weren't themselves. Leonard seems to be getting weaker as a character, even though I felt like overall he was the most interesting. THey make it seem like he simply bows to Penny's every wim.. while also bowing to Sheldon's every wim.. it's like he has become the ""b----"" character of the group instead of the interesting one. Raj is a helpless horndog, Howard has become whiny at every turn and overly jealous of Stewart to the point of being excessive, and Sheldon seems confused on what direction they want to take his character.

I still enjoyed the season, but I would like to see the characters return to form and progress in a more natural path instead of just randomly jumping around.",1467849600,2,980,4.5

6340894,1,B00J9BZVQE,"What a waste after a brilliant season 7. All the characters do is fight. There is a war between Howard and Stewart. Penny and Bernadette. I'm sure there are others, but every episode is based on a fight. We aren't too partial to the bromance of Sheldon and Leonard, but characters develop and Amy has softened Sheldon so its to be expected, but it has become a little too extreme, too quickly. The fighting is sickening and the cliff hangers are ridiculous. The episodes tend to take on a plot, but the writers never develop the whole thing and the episode ends. The series is doomed to failure if they can't reinvent the brilliance of season 7 and the other predecessor seasons.",1467676800,,679,4.573770491803279

6341129,5,B00J9BZVQE,"I was so excited and did not hesitate at all when I saw the Amazon Prime price tag of $14.95 on this Blu-Ray DVD. I have been waiting what feels like forever to see all of the Season 8 episodes of the Big Bang Theory!

The DVD was delivered on time by the UPS. The product was packaged appropriately for shipping. On arrival, the product was in perfect condition with no visible damages to DVD case.

There was a slip inside the case with a code for a digital copy of Season 8, which I immediately claimed and added to my Vudu library. There was also an insert included inside the DVD case which gave an individual description of each episode. There was a total of 2 blu-ray discs which contained all 24 of the Season 8 episodes. Both discs were in perfect condition, free from scratches and imperfections, and played smoothly all the way to the end.

What's my opinion of the Big Bang Theory Season 8 episodes? Well, keep in mind that I am a HUGE fan of the show and even have a life-size cardboard cutout of Sheldon Cooper in my bedroom... Enough said :)

The Big Bang Theory Season 8 is a must see for anyone who hasn't seen any or all of the episodes yet. And if you have already seen these 24 episodes, but haven't yet purchased this for your collection...go ahead and click ""Buy Now"". And, if you're not already a member, sign up for an Amazon Prime membership so you can score the free 2-day shipping (plus a ton of other perks!).",1461888000,2,1437,4.311111111111111

I watched a couple of episodes and just like that I was hooked. I would say The Big Bang Theory is on par with ""That 70's Show"" and ""Friends.""  After seven seasons one would think that the show would have grown a little stale or have begun to lose its appeal (like That 70's Show). I mean, how long can you watch the hilarious misadventures of nerds and not get tired of it? Turns out to season eight and beyond. Season eight is every bit as funny as the first few seasons. The characters have grown and evolved but the hilarity continues.  If you don't already own the eighth season I highly recommend it.",1461024000,,737,4.333333333333333

6341190,4,B00J9BZVQE,"Season 8s finale is one of the best episodes yet and entirely whets your appetite to season 9 and whats on point with the finale is that by-and-large a lot of the plot actually carries through toward building to the finale.  Amy is becoming more and more of Americas sweetheart as she continues to put up with Sheldons nonsenseer, difficulties and eccentricities.  The break in their relationship doesnt come so much as a shock as does the reveal of what Sheldon was contemplating.  And then there is Raj and Emily.  Emily is adorable/ creepy, and she doesnt really fit, but can Raj get rid of her?  The heart of the season, though, is found in the relationship and trials of Howard and Bernadette.  These two are comic gold and always play superbly off of each other and when you throw glum chum Stuart into the mix, he whos just happy to be there, it creates a fresh dynamic that is fun but allows some serious tension to underlie the increasingly complicated relationship.  Of course, Howards mom passes this season, and the shows writers and performers honor her memory in a funny way that is completely respectful and will bring tears to fans eyes.  The weak point of the season really is the old hash of Penny and Leonards relationship which loses some luster this season.  Their relationship starts to feel a little doughy.  But overall the laughs are still there and these are characters that we (mostly) come to care about.  Im rooting for Stuart.  I hope he gets his own show (but I wouldnt watch it).  4.5 stars.",1460160000,,1523,4.617100371747212

I connected my Pandora to it and all my stations come through just fine. I also have my audible account set up and it plays my audiobooks as well.

I thought the price was a little high but after getting it I am not even fretting on the price. I listen to music and podcasts again.

I can make appointment reminders. Make a shopping list. Set alarms and timers. And the list goes on.

I recommend the echo to anyone who would like a personal assistant.",1455580800,,611,4.1525423728813555

Either way I am a huge die hard fan so I'll still buy every season and watch every single episode. Also Bernadette made me so incredibly mad by how insensitive she was being towards Howard.

6341609,5,B00J9BZVQE,"I purchased the Big Bang Theory, Season 8 and I'm very happy that I did. I have been watching a lot of other shows, but this one is awesome because it centers around a group of roommates who are physicist.
Leading the pack are roommates Leonard and Sheldon who are friends with Raj  and Howard, Howard being the only engineer. Penny moved across the hall from Leonard and Sheldon. Leonard and Penny got engaged, and still live across the hall from each other. Over the years, Howard has married Bernadette and Sheldon has started dating Amy. And Raj has a steady girlfriend, Emily.

Sheldons left town on a cross country train trip. He gets robbed!  And he goes back to Pasadena, California. He goes through a lot of facing his fears and changeds in is life and one is teaching a class at CalTech for the first time. His only student is Howard! Howard, meanwhile, has to find a way to throw out the first pitch at a baseball game. Penny leaves behind her dream of acting for a job working pharmaceutical sales at the same company where Bernadette works, although the door might not quite be closed on acting. Raj has to deal with the fall out of his parents divorce. The ladies spend an evening uncovering each others shameful secrets. And the entire gang puts on a prom on their roof with hilarious results. And we got more of Stuart, the owner of the local comic book store, who was living with Howards mother while his store was rebuilt, much to Howards dismay.

This is as far as I've gotten! But this purchase is a perfect gift to others and for your household! It's funny!! It's entertaining! It's a great addition to my DVD collection! Non stop laughs!

I  received this product at a discount rate for my honest and unbiased review.",1453334400,,1739,4.522292993630574
6341610,5,B00J9BZVQE,I've been a big fan of BBT since the beginning and season 8 was great.  I love the growing relationship between Sheldon and Amy and the crazy girlfriend of Raz.  My only complaint would be the relationship between Leonard and Penny.  For awhile they seemed very distructive towards each other but thankfully in season 8 it seemed to start to get back on the right track with them and their relationship was more reminiscent of the first season.  As far as the dvd itself goes... it doesn't have anything amazing or unique but it is packaged nicely and all the discs work great so that works for me!,1453334400,,598,4.5092592592592595

They have the girls all fully involved now, and the relationships are all evolving well.
The cliffhanger is interesting.  Well, for those who don't have TV anyway!
Can't wait for Season 9 to get released.  Hard to believe they've been at it for this long.
STILL an excellent show, and I rank it up there with the Sopranos and The Good Wife.

I now own season 1-8 and never tire of watching them. Every time you see an episode again there is something you missed, a new laugh. At 53 I have watched decades of sitcoms from B&W to HD.

You mentioned a brother for Sheldon? New one on me... I know he has a twin sister (fraternal only - thankfully, for the BBT CREW. Don't think they could survive Sheldon 2.0!), and at the time, all the other guys were single and hitting on her! Can't remember her name, tho. And I still want to know what happened between Sheldon's mom and the president of their college. Did he ever become Sheldon's new Dr. Daddy? Or is that scheduled for a future episode?! LOLq

As for my rating of season 8? How could it possibly be anything less than a 5.5, OR 10.9 on the Richter Scale?!! (Qualifying/ correcting that --- all BBT seasons are, indeed, stellar!)
Signed, - Super Fan, TCK

While I still feel that the show has dipped, I don't think London Bridge is falling down as I had feared. Upon watching the DVDs of this season, I found that there were a number of humorous moments such as: the interaction between Sheldon and Leonards moms for example. It just often episode wide laughter like was experienced in the first few years of the show.",1449619200,,522,4.447916666666667

If you are not familiar with the series yet, it started out as a story of four super nerds who struggle with having relationships with girls and dealing with everyday life. As the seasons progress they all are involved in long term relationships but still battle with maintaining them and other life problems. In my opinion the show is losing a lot of it's great comedy. I know characters have to evolve and cannot stay the same 8 years straight, but now the show has lost what originally made it great.

I appreciated how the show gave each character new roles, and challenges instead of staying stagnant. For example (spoiler alert), Penny's developing career places her as more than the dependent actress, and causes Leonard to question his role in their relationship (is he more than the $ he can provide). These weightier moments are pleasantly surrounded with classic BBT style humor, and a chance to peak into nerd heaven. Sheldon at Skywalker ranch had to be my favorite moment.",1446768000,,571,5.285714285714286

6342306,3,B00J9BZVQE,"Although the BBT is one of my alltime favorite series, season 8 was disapointing. I have all 8 series and will puchase the next.  The creative writing and acting has somewhat run its course.  As with most series that have been on for years, tlhe spark seems to be somewhat gone. I predict the end of the series will be coming soon. I am sad since I so love that show but all things, even good things, do come to an end.  It probably would be best if they ended it while on a high. The characters have become redundant, somewhat uninteresting, and no longer as brilliant and funny.  These are all wonderful brilliant great actors but perhaps it's time they moved on as well. Unlike All in the Family, the Goldern Girls, or MASH, etc.,which either had offshoots that failed or MASH, another of my favoites, which simply should have ended a season or two before they did. My view is not to bash BBT just to encourage everyone involved  to end one of the most sucessful and brilliant TV series of all time so I can remember its genius, not its demise. Thanks.

6342355,3,B00J9BZVQE,"This season was just ok.  This show is just all about everyone's relationships now.  It's getting boring and old.  Gone are the chauvinistic wise cracks from Howard.  The interesting geekiness and science is dwindling as well.  The jokes are predictable and not very funny.  I predict a pregnancy next season and that'll be all she wrote for this show.  Have you ever noticed when writers run out of ideas for a show, that someone has a baby and shortly thereafter the show is canceled?  BBT is headed down that road quickly.

Anyways, BBT is still better than all sitcoms on tv currently (They have no competition).

Edit:  See, I called the baby well ahead of time.  It is just how these shows go.  They will milk out a season 10 and then that'll be all she wrote for BBT.  The formula for this show is good, but the formula is tired.",1444780800,3,836,4.450331125827814

The cast members' tears were genuine and obviously for Carol Ann Susi.  Mine were too. The show did not mention Carol Ann Susi's passing when the episode aired. I thought it should have. Her voice characterization was truly memorable. Melissa Rauch does a very accurate imitation of Susi's voice as Mrs Wolowitz.

Mayim Bialik has caused Amy Farrah Fowler's character to ""Blossom"". She is funny without overdoing it. I feel for Amy's lonely childhood and unrequited love of Sheldon. Yet she is forever optimistic. A role model for young girls. Thank you Mayim.",1444348800,,687,4.913793103448276

Big Bang 8 is just what the doctor ordered, so to speak. Except maybe the doctor wasn't called in time to save the great Ms. Wolowitz, Carol Ann Susi. This was a great actress, and a wonderful lady, with a memorable voice. I do hate we lost her off screen, on screen, and real world- but I know she is happier than we are.

6342577,5,B00J9BZVQE,"I've been following the Big Bang Theory since the first season and to my surprise it hasn't lost it's essence and magic after 7 seasons of clever writing, lovely relatable characters and funny jokes. Unlike many other TV series, you don't need to commit to this show in order to enjoy it. With short episodes, having usually independent storylines, you can always watch an episode, or even a scene, whenever you get some free time and want to have some pure fun. Nonetheless, this is one of the best series for binge-watching on weekends or vacation days.

However, you might ask yourself why you need to buy the Blu-rays or DVDs after watching the show on TV or DVR? Other than the joy of collecting such an amazing show, an important thing to know is the show's re-watching value. Even today, I can go back and watch an episode from the first season and enjoy the characters I've been following for all these years.

6342626,5,B00J9BZVQE,"If you like mathematical humor, social awkwardness, and random facts about trains or flags, then The Big Bang Theory is the show for you! It is a comedy show that airs on CBS but you can also catch reruns on TBS or FOX. This show offers comedic relief in the form of everyday life.
 The eighth season follows the lives of seven friends, living in California, as they go through the trials and tribulations of life, work, and love. Penny is looking for a new job and trying to navigate her elevated relationship with Leonard. Meanwhile, Amy and Sheldon are working on taking their relationship to the next level while Sheldon is re-evaluating his career change. Raj has a new girlfriend and is now trying to balance both her and the rest of his friends. Bernadette and Howard are working their way through the marital bliss while keeping their careers alive.
 This season has 24 episodes, spaced between 3 discs, which flow smoothly from one to the next. Every episode will make you laugh at least once and they all continue building on the series as a whole. This season will also make you cry multiple times because of how attached you get to the characters and their relationships.
 I bought this season because I started watching The Big Bang Theory when it first aired eight years ago and I got hooked. I got attached to the characters and became addicted to watching it. Getting attached to the characters is easy because every character has some trait that you can also see in yourself. For me, it was the social awkwardness of Sheldon mixed with the brain of Amy and the sarcastic nature of Leonard. This season is ideal for those who just want to go home after school or work, sit back, relax, and laugh because all discs have a play all option. You wouldnt have to move for hours, unless you chose to do so.
 If this sounds like a show that interests you, Friends is another, similar show, which you might appreciate. If this does not sound interesting to you, then there are many other shows that might interest you like Criminal Minds or Bar Rescue.",1443052800,2,2060,4.574525745257453
6342627,4,B00J9BZVQE,"I never thought Penny was pretty but in that haircut she is outright ugly. Leonard still wants to marry her so I guess love really is blind.
In seasons 3-5 they slowly removed the science from the show. I guess enough people complained because in seasons 6-8 it's been making a comeback, YAY!
The writers are getting sloppy. No way Sheldon would call a tortoise a turtle. Neither would Amy.
Howard and Bernadette make a great couple, it's hilarious to see her morphing into his mother.
Sheldon and Amy are awesome!
Leonard and Penny do not in any way shape or form belong together and they know it. Leonard is just persisting because it strokes his ego to have her. In a few years when she puts on some weight he'll realize what a terrible mistake she is. The show won't run that long but we all know it.
It's not just that she's stupid. She's also a drunk, and has rage issues.
Hopefully Alex will be around to pick up the pieces when he finally gets it.",1443052800,,955,4.370786516853933

Leonard is the only character I still like. Sheldon, Howard and Bernadette are mean, cruel and manipulative, while Amy is so desperate to remain in with the in crowd that she has become vicious and backstabbing. Raj won't stand up for his best friend, and Penny is becoming more expedient and, like Bernadette, willing to let people suffer by using drugs they make and sell, knowing that some are deadly. Leonard is the only one who seems to still have a conscience, a heart and a sense of decency. Too bad that the writing has gone so far downhill.",1442707200,,716,4.431818181818182

6342715,5,B00J9BZVQE,"+++Warning+++  The review contains spoilers from prior seasons and hints, but no major giveaways, from season 8.  If you have not seen the previous season proceed with caution.

The show seems to be one that people either really love or really hate.  Luckily it has been around long enough that most people know where they fall.  It continues to focus on the relationships between the main characters, then tells various ancillary stories of the week while working in some larger ongoing themes.  This season the big stories are Leonard and Penny's ongoing engagement and not setting a date for the wedding, Leonard and Sheldon co-authoring a physics paper which gets them some notoriety, and Sheldon and Amy's relationship.  There are other stories about Stuart mooching off Howard's mom following the destruction of the comic book store last season, Raj's parents  and his new relationship that develops now that he can actually talk to girls without being drunk.  A couple of the stand out episodes of the season are the Billy Bob Thornton guest appearance, Sheldon and Leonard's mothers meeting, and the season finale which ends on a pretty big Sheldon/Amy cliffhanger.  There is also a story line that occurs about 2/3 of the way into the season that leads to some great Howard and Bernadette scenes, and shows off the acting chops of Simon Helberg in general.

For those who get the actual discs, if you get the blu ray, the transfer seems very good, and the show looks and sounds great.  For extras, on disc one there is a relatively short writers panel (and Wil Wheton appearance) from comic-con, and a behind the scenes feature on Billy Bob Thornton's guest appearance.  The second disc has a feature on a group of contest winners who were taken to the set and sit in the studio audience, a short feature on Kaley Cuoco, Jim Parsons and Chuck Lorre getting stars on the Walk of Fame, a tribute to Carol Ann Susi, and a gag reel.  Definitely good for what is there.

If you have loved the show and do not think it has gone stale then you will love this season.  If you have hated the show either because of the laugh track or any other reason, this season is not really going to do anything to change your mind.  Thankfully the show is popular enough that the studio is still released on blu ray, for those of us who get the discs and prefer that format.  The show definitely lays the groundwork for where it is going next season.  As other reviewers have said it would be good if the show took some of the focus off the relationship of the main characters and incorporated more of their families into some episodes.  That said however, if you love the show this is definitely worth adding to your collection.",1442534400,2,2717,4.644351464435147

6342762,2,B00J9BZVQE,"The seventh season of the show is my favorite.  After that I found season eight a big disappointment.

Only episode I really liked was episode 19 ""The Skywalker Incursion.""

Now, what happened to a blu ray/DVD set?  SAME PRICE but we ONLY get blu rays in this package.  What a major league let down and a waste of money.

Since when is Billy Bob Thornton, or as I call him Billy Bob Divorce, a big name?  How many years ago was his Oscar & how many wives ago was that?  What the D list was made for.

The extras with the set.  The Walk of Fame.  Kaley got one?  Did not know that & why?  Jim the multiple Emmy winner & Chuck I understand but Kaley & the mans hair cut?

Glad they did a tribute Carol Ann Susi after she past away.

Again, a disappointing season & this set without the DVDs this year is a big disappointment and waste of money.",1442275200,4,842,4.079754601226994

6342764,5,B00J9BZVQE,"At some point, all shows go through a slump.  Its almost impossible to keep the quality of the laughs up year and year no matter how great the team is behind the show.  Honestly, Im still waiting for that to happen with The Big Bang Theory.  Here we are at season 8, and Im still loving it.

For those who have missed the show, it centers on a bunch of physicist.  Leading the pack are roommates Leonard (Johnny Galecki) and Sheldon (Jim Parons) who are friends with Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg), Howard being the only engineer of the core group.  The series started when Penny (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting) moved in across the hall from Leonard and Sheldon.  Things have changed, and now Leonard and Penny are engaged, although they still have the same living arrangements.  Over the years, Howard has married Bernadette (Melissa Rauch) and Sheldon has started dating Amy (Mayim Bailik).  Even Raj has a steady girlfriend this year in the form of recurring character Emily (Laura Spencer).

At the end of season seven, Sheldons reaction to changes in his life lead him to leave town on a cross country train trip.  As the season opens, he calls requesting to be picked up.  Why?  Hes been robbed.  That brings him back to the characters home base of Pasadena, California, but he has to start processing the changes in his life.  One of those changes finds him teaching a class at CalTech for the first time.  The catch?  His only student is Howard.  Howard, meanwhile, has to find a way to throw out the first pitch at a baseball game.  Penny leaves behind her dream of acting for a job working pharmaceutical sales at the same company where Bernadette works, although the door might not quite be closed on acting.  Raj has to deal with the fall out of his parents divorce.  The ladies spend an evening uncovering each others shameful secrets.  And the entire gang puts on a prom on their roof with hilarious results.  And we got more of Stuart (Kevin Sussman), the owner of the local comic book store, who was living with Howards mother while his store was rebuilt, much to Howards dismay.

The season took a bit of a somber note when actress Carol Ann Susi died in November.  While never seen, she had provided the off screen voice of Howards mother since the start of the show.  As a result, the writers killed off her character mid-season, providing some well done more somber moments.  It also provided some great storylines late in the season as Howard and Bernadette started working on moving into her home.  I especially loved a ping pong battle episode.

The shows detractors complain that, while it started out as a love letter to geeks, it has now evolved into a show about the characters and their relationships with their significant others.  They do have a valid point.  If you go back and watch the early episodes, the subject matter is often different.

But heres the thing  I don't care.  And why not?  Because Im still laughing.  The jokes are just as funny.  Even if I see them coming, I still cant help but laugh as the characters deliver the lines.

And heres another reason it is a good thing.  Humans grow and change.  The best characters, the ones I love the most, grow and change as well.  If the show tried to stay to the same with the same characters and relationships they had in the first few years, I would be bored with it by now.  Instead, its a show I look forward to watching every Thursday night and the only show I have my DVR record the reruns for.  Thats right, I laugh just as hard at the reruns as I do the first airings of the show, and I never miss a chance to watch the reruns.

Despite the changes, there are still plenty of jokes at geek culture and geeky things.  After all, they built an entire episode around Leonard and Sheldon trying to visit Skywalker Ranch.  The ladies know more than they are willing to admit about the things their men love.  Its a fun show with a fun dynamic.

And the acting continues to be great.  All the main actors know their characters by this point, and their portrayals are perfect.  The recurring characters are fantastic as well and Laura Spencers Emily fits right in as well.  Honestly, I wish wed see more of her.

This season consisted of 24 episodes, which are all included here in their wide screen and full surround.  Extras include a salute to the fans, highlights from the 2014 ComicCon panel, a tribute to Carol Ann Susi, and a gag reel.

So if you need to laugh, I highly recommend The Big Bang Theorys eighth season.  These episodes will fly by all too quickly, and youll be left wanting to know what happens to everyones favorite geeks next.",1442188800,8,4646,4.525872442839952
6342765,5,B00J9BZVQE,"I love this show but will not buy the Blue Ray DVD as it does not come with an iTunes digital copy.

6342766,5,B00J9BZVQE,"Just a really fun show to watch. Must pay attention to capture all the jokes; so I must watch several times to get all the punch lines. Obviously sad about the loss of Carol Ann Susi as Mrs. Wolowitz. She was a fun, and funny part of the Big Bang Family, though we never got to see her character live. Part of the comedy was to image what she must really look like with all the jokes made about her weight. Looking forward to season nine in a couple weeks.

They're all separate and not together much anymore, it's all relationships and such now. And Raj.... break up with Emily please. Cause some friction between Bernadette and Howard to get them to break up, get rid of Amy as well.... then it'll be funny again.

6342959,4,B00J9BZVQE,"This show has been my #1 favorite show for a long time now. The Big Bang Theory is honestly a show I can relate to (im a bit of a nerd myself). Leonard and Sheldon are a funny duo and Raj and Howard are the perfect addition to their group. Penny is delightfully funny and Amy and Bernadette are also hilarious characters. From seasons 1-7, the show was at its best, but when Season 8 came along, it went downhill. Now the show focuses on the relationships and not the nerdiness. But I am a Big Bang Theory fan for life and no matter what happens, I am still hooked to this great, nerdy comedy!!!!! (and that is not a bazinga)",1437004800,,625,4.1735537190082646

6342961,3,B00J9BZVQE,"The show just isn't working anymore. It is so sad. I absolutely LOVED this show. I watch very little television but BBT has been one of four shows I use to watch religiously. I would wait anxiously for each season to come out, buy it and then invite my friends over to for a marathon weekend. This is the first year I will not do this. The show is just not funny anymore and it is painful to watch. It use to be so good. Here is why: Penny and Leonard: Seriously, this just isn't working. Holy cow, have them get married or break them up. This relationship is so stilted, unromantic and just stuck in a quagmire. Sheldon: Sheldon, this season is just mean. Before he was just kind of clueless but still loveable. The way he treats Howard this season is just horrible. And speaking of Howard, holy cow, give the guy a break. He doesn't have to always be the butt of the joke. The very first episode of the season would have been so much better had they just let him have him moment of glory. Raj: Dump the girlfriend. Emily is just not working. I thought they were going to give Raj some juevos this season but no, when it came time for the big break-up, he backed down. (Sorry Spoiler) I could go on but this show is definitely not what it was. I re-watch the first few seasons and I cringe to think how good it is and just how bad it is becoming. Please, bring back the ""nerdiness"" and have some real growth with these characters or I am going to stop watching.",1436659200,15,1462,4.2064056939501775

I have caught up on all of the seasons and this show has had me almost on the floor laughing. What is unfortunately going on now in season 8 is that the relationships are getting in the way of what made this show funny. The nerdiness of the characters is gone. This season had some good episodes, but they were few and far between. I really hope the writers can get this show back on track, because this show is one of my favorites.

6343210,5,B00J9BZVQE,"I've never missed an episode and have preordered every season's blu-ray.  My hubby, son and I binge-watch seasons. Best show on TV!! Happily, it's going for at least 3 more years...Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting and Johnny Galecki all signed on for a MILLION dollars per episode. They're worth it. There's a reason they're stacking up Emmy's, particularly Jim Parsons whose comedic timing and refusal to be a one-note clich are stellar (as Raj would appreciate).

I really enjoy the growth of each character each season (though I roll my eyes every time they tease Howard and Raj for being, virtually, a lesbian couple. That bit is getting to be a yawner). Sheldon had to switch his whole course of research; Leonard got more props for his innovative dissertation; Penny finally got a ""real"" job; Howard lost his mom (RIP Carol Ann Susi); Bernadette is a b-- ... er ... pretty scary to her coworkers; Raj finally got a new, albeit creepy, girlfriend. And Amy...well...after 6 years she's finally lost patience waiting for Sheldon to grow up. But what's this??

SHELDON HAD A BREAK-THROUGH. Cliff-hanger. No spoilers.

I liked the interplay between Sheldon's and Leonard's mothers. Too bad about Raj's parents. We only saw Bernadette's dad once this season, saw Amy's mom and Penny's dad just once a few years ago; and have seen nothing of Penny's mom, or Amy's dad. (We know about Howard's and Sheldon's dads.) Penny and Sheldon each has a brother and Leonard has a couple siblings we've never seen--maybe they'll crop up this season or next. (The only sibs we've ever seen are Raj's and Sheldon's sisters.)

And I'm liking Stuart more and more! (Do you know his last name on the show? See Comment below.)

And Stephen Hawking. Ya gotta love how they incorporate that genius into the show.

Sure, there is only so much comedy you can place into a show before it becomes a little stagnant and some of the relationships drag out at times, but still cute to watch.  What makes this show very appealing to many (in my opinion) is that the characters are rather ""average"" looking and so most mortals can relate -vs- the series ""Friends"" which didn't have an average looking person in the crowd, plus how'd they all afford that lifestyle in NYC?

Each episode is a half hour long which isn't bad. That means more adventures and they can have a lot more different stories. This isn't just a nerd show. You'll fall in love with all of the characters and you can watch it with your kids and family. The show makes me laugh and i put the theme song as my ring tone on my phone.

As someone with degrees in both math and physics, I have to say that the characters in this show are ridiculously 2-dimensional, and thier references to theoretical physics and advanced mathematics are shallow and inconsistent.

All the ""pretty"" women are idiots and most of the jokes revolve around the fact that these guys are so much smarter than everyone else.

The writing is terrible.

He was becoming too much of the focus of the last couple seasons, but making his air time comparable to the other characters has really brought the show back to it's roots.

Penny's career takes a different turn. Raj and Howard both continue to develop as characters.

The show continues to be really funny and creative. It's well worth hanging on to even if you were starting to waiver after season 7.

Often when a show gets a refresh it's changed around so much that it practically becomes a different series. Big Bang Theory managed to freshed things up without making major changed to the look and feel of the show so it continues to flow nicely with the rest of the series.",1428624000,38,843,4.532894736842105

6343646,4,B00J9BZVQE,"Unlike many shows, this show stays strong through season 8. I like how Penny and Leonard's relationship is progressing (although I would like more detail on this), and that Raj is getting meaningful storylines. Plus, the show is dealing with the death of the actress who voices Howard's mom beautifully - they are paying tribute to her in the show and giving her a meaningful goodbye.

Sheldon and Amy have great parts this season, and the most recent episode (regarding Mars) is laugh out loud funny.

A major problem I am having is Penny's hair. I just can't get into it. Penny's long, fun hair was a big part of her character, and the short hair just isn't suited to her. I don't find it cute or sexy or fun - it takes away from Penny's character. Maybe it works for Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, but it doesn't work for Penny.

I'm also a little weirded out by Emily this season - she jokes about killing people in a recent episode and it's not funny, it's creepy. And she seemed very real in prior episodes and this just makes her more of a 'character' and less of a 'real' person. Does that make sense? Unless they're going to turn her into some crazy murderer (which I really hope not) it didn't play out well.

All criticism aside, this show is fantastic - must watch for any comedy fan.",1425600000,,1287,4.440677966101695

6343706,3,B00J9BZVQE,"Right off the bat, I want to say that BBT is one of the best comedy series of all time.  Its merits are so golden I'm even happy to ""get through"" season 8's sudden fall from comedic grace with optimistic anticipation of season 9!

What went right: Season 1-7

What went wrong: Season 8 (details below)

1. From the very first episode, there was an extraordinarily powerful ""aura"" of discomfort between the previously ""close/warm"" familiarity of the characters.  I remember being uncomfortably aware of it and considering the fact that I'm not a director or ""professional movie staff"" of any kind, it hit me rather hard that everybody on the show seemed like strangers all of a sudden just in the ""energy"" between them.

2. Penny's hair (and personality) appear to have been cut from the show.  Now, I don't know how much getting an eight dollar snip affects anybody else's personality, but it sure as 7734 upside down affected Penny's!  Not only does the ""Miley Cyrus Do"" make her LOOK gawky and lanky, it also seems to have made her project that with body language and dialogue delivery.  What I don't know is whether or not that is a deliberate character change intended or just the result of a fashion choice.

3. Finally, when I tune in to watch a comedy on television, I am looking to escape the drama and pains of real life and just have fun, thus my selection of a ""comedy"" on the tube.  And while I DO understand that a ""wee bit o' drama"" (nothing too heavy!) to initiate and instigate growing affection for characters is likely to make a better comedy than without, I resent heavy hits of real drama and depressive material.  It's like cheating.  If I WANTED to watch a drama, I'd be tuned into one.  HEAVY drama, in my opinion, is a betrayal of trust against the viewers on the part of the writers and anybody else involved in script production.  --I do realize there will probably be a bunch of ""hate replies"" to this last statement I've made indicating my apparent lack of humanity and heart because I resent heavy sadness, disease or any other awful life plight in my 22 minute comedy shows, but I have to represent at least a couple of watchers out there in TV land.

Like I said, I'll keep watching because I feel enough loyalty to the characters to stick with them while the going is rough but I sure would love to see the comedy come back.

Another viewer mentioned the under-utilization of Amy and Bernadette--hear hear!  Amy is my favorite character hands down, particularly when she's irritated with/then forgiving poor Sheldon!

A toast!  To another 8 years of BBT!",1424995200,25,2586,4.604803493449782
6343707,5,B00J9BZVQE,"Always fun. Even though the dynamics are different as everyone pairs off, the chemistry of great friendships is still there.",1424908800,,124,5.25
6343708,5,B00J9BZVQE,"Season 8 is staying fresh. Sheldon has been toned down a bit and is becoming more of a dynamic character, rather than just repeating the same situations over and over. He was becoming too much of the focus of the last couple seasons, but making his air time comparable to the other characters has really brought the show back to it's roots.

The show continues to be really funny and creative. It's well worth hanging on to even if you were starting to waiver after season 7.",1424908800,,475,4.459770114942529

6343794,5,B00J9BZVQE,"I've been following the Big Bang Theory since the first season and to my surprise it hasn't lost it's essence and magic after 7 seasons of clever writing, lovely relatable characters and funny jokes. Unlike many other TV series, you don't need to commit to this show in order to enjoy it. With short episodes, having usually independent storylines, you can always watch an episode, or even a scene, whenever you get some free time and want to have some pure fun. Nonetheless, this is one of the best series for binge-watching on weekends or vacation days.

However, you might ask yourself why you need to buy the Blu-rays or DVDs after watching the show on TV or DVR? Other than the joy of collecting such an amazing show, an important thing to know is the show's re-watching value. Even today, I can go back and watch an episode from the first season and enjoy the characters I've been following for all these years.

I find it interesting that right after Kelly Kualco (sic) gets married they change her character from catty and flirty to a more mature, professional persona, perhaps for the sake of her marriage. The main beef I have with the show is the network who constantly trumpets the airing of ""special"" episodes which turn out to be reruns (and often times not of the current season as well.) I hope that the network would also take note that I am willing to pay $2.99 to watch the show FREE OF COMMERCIALS, the number of which drive me absolutely crazy. I continue watch the show since this seems to be the best quality of sitcom that America can offer, however I'm not laughing as much this season as I did in previous seasons.

Why not just let this show die a natural death, or maybe it's dong it.

Homer never got smarter, Bart and Lisa never grew up. Hank Hill never had to ""move on"", Bobby never got engaged.

I'm suspect that all the cast of this ""friends=Geek"" spin off are rich enough that they, (and the writers) just don't care any more. I'd be surprised if this show goes on to season 9......",1419897600,3,617,4.651376146788991

The last episode I saw before writing this review (episode 16, The intimacy acceleration) went nowhere. A story about Penny and Sheldon bonding, Howard retrieving his mother's ashes, and the rest of the gang going to a mystery game - which had the only funny moments in the entire show with the ""zombie's"" warnings about not getting a refund if you solve the mystery too fast. The other episodes this season have really not impressed me either. Time for some new writers and some fun plot twists.

The characters are still wonderful but the size of ensemble cast and the multiple story lines are making it apparent to me at least that we have to feed so many lines to each, wait for the laugh, move on to next character's line, etc.  Still enjoyable and has some wonderful moments, but it is losing its freshness.  Once the guys get the girls, or it is the other way around, most of the positive tension and character development has ebbed.

I'm glad to know it's going to be around for another couple of years as that gives them time to resolve story lines, but I think by the time it hits the ten year mark it will be time to put it out to pasture.",1415836800,,682,4.2153846153846155

6344257,1,B00J9BZVQE,"Free of that fresh wit, that energized banter and delightful geek humor that was the driving force behind BBT, Season 8 has deteriorated into tired cliches and a barely disguised platform for feminist gender politics. It was funny when Amy would complain about Sheldon's lack of amorous advances; it is tedious and offputting for the for a song I'd change my gender preference Amy to sabotage a magazine article which promoted Bernadette's looks as a scientist. A dull thud was heard for miles as that subplot fell more than flat. Compare that to the irony of S6E18 Contractual Obligation Implementation with Amy & Bernadette as Disney dressup princesses advising preteen girls on science careers. Penny's character as sexy worldly wise bimbo in the world of geeks has been seriously compromised.  Her having to explain the obvious to Leonard - and even scripting that - since the cast previously stated there is no adlibbing - provided the second (at least) dull thud. And that is a sad commentary. Oh - and Penny's hair - speaks more to this debimboizing subtext this show wants to provide. She was cute as hell with that long hair. The new direction & new hair robs her of that freshness she had. And the tiresome jokes about Howard & his mother - been there, used that. What was with that contrived plot where Sheldon & Koothrapali 'simulated' an underground expedition. I felt bad Raj's character was given such hackeyed dialogue. Any feature which fails to utilize a newly facially reconstructed Billy Bob Thornton - given his tremendous skill as an actor and ability to do droll so well - obviously someone killed off the competent script writers. I own all 7 previous seasons, and have enjoyed them. Not one episode of season 8 is a must have. Obviously Sheldon lost something more than his luggage at the end of Season 7. He lost the creative wellspring of the entire enterprise. I love these characters. They deserve better dialogue, better plots, less politics, more fun.",1414627200,16,1982,4.863905325443787

6344261,2,B00J9BZVQE,"Inevitably, the characters become caricatures, and the humor has become less subtle: more easy vulgar laughs. 'Modern Family' sustains itself much more effectively. It's amazing that BBT kept up a reasonable standard for so long!",1414454400,5,229,5.571428571428571

6344263,2,B00J9BZVQE,"Pay attention:  the show is going downhill because the real world is intruding on the fantasy world.  Early in the show, if you'll remember, there was plenty of touching and kissing and talk about sex between the two actors Johnny Galecki (as Leonard) and Kaley Cuoco (as Penny).  Then it was revealed that in real life these two actors had an affair that they'd kept secret.  Not long after that, Kaley Cuoco got married to another man, changed her name to Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting, and from that time on the fantasy relationship between Leonard and Penny has become very tame, tepid, and hands-off.  Notice how all the touching, kissing, and references to sex are completely watered down?  The writers have created a distance between them physically, possibly at the request of the actors themselves.  Who knows.  Now the show focuses on the other actors' relationships, but there's no tension or emotional upset there.  Raj finally gets a girlfriend whom we almost never see.  Howard and Bernadette have become a comfortably married couple.  Sheldon and Amy are going nowhere, as usual.  Ho-Hum.  Much of the appeal of the show used to be based on the ""Will they? or Won't they?"" plots, none of which hold any interest any more.  The writers may try to pump up the show's appeal by using the same old story lines:  Leonard and Penny break up for some reason, Howard and Bernadette have a crisis of some kind, Sheldon and Amy go one step farther, Raj and his girlfriend??  Same old, same old.  Time to move on.  I'm done watching.  The show is tired and the writers are uninspired.",1414281600,19,1579,4.738970588235294

6344383,4,B00J9BZVQE,"Like many, I am a huge fan of this show.  This episode, ""The Hook-Up Reverberation"" left me with some doubt about the direction of the story line to come.  99% was good old fashion comedy we have all come to love about this group of actors and the lives the lead.  However, this friction between Penny and Emily where they ""hate"" each other is truly unnecessary and has the potential to sour the love for the show if they continue along this story line.

Every week many of us turn to this show simply for the pure enjoyment.  Some tune in for the nostalgia for our own past and our ability to connect with these characters in one or another.  We want to cheer for these nerds that overcame adversity and are now able to have successful personal lives.  Aren't we all happy that the nerds all have girl friends and are finding happiness?  Can most of us relate to this?  This is one of the factors that has made this show the ultimate success

This is one of those shows we don't want to see a long running conflict between characters.  The audience wants these characters to find there happiness, we cheer for these characters because we can in fact relate to them from some of our personal experiences.  I recognize that conflict makes for good story lines...such as Penny and Sheldon when she had three strikes and was banished from the apartment.  But the conflict was brilliantly resolved within that episode.

A continuation of conflict between Penny and Emily is not what the viewers want.

Jim Parsons deservedly won his 4th Emmy playing Sheldon Cooper as of Season 7. This matches the all-time record set by Michael J. Fox, Kelsey Grammer and Carroll O'Connor (are you guys too young for Archie Bunker of All in the Family?). It would be fantastic if he won one more. Parsons, Johnny Galecki (Leonard Hofstsadler) and Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting (Penny NO LAST NAME) signed on for 3 more seasons and will make $1 million PER episode!!! Whoo hoo hoooooo! This show will beat the 10-year record of Friends which has a similar set-up: 6 friends, 2 of whom get married to each other, with each episode usually having 3 story arcs.

I haven't missed an episode since the first one and have purchased each season's HD DVD set by pre-ordering on Amazon. The reason you want to get the set is not only for repeated viewing but also the special features. They've gotten better and better with each new season.
