8052372,5,B0007VY4ZY,"Greg Mullavy gives an excellent performance as a haunted, guilt-ridden Vietnam veteran who decides to track down and kill the men who forced him to commit atrocities during the war.

This is a straightforward, no -frills, zero budget enterprise. The camera-work is competent, if a bit simple. The acting is acceptable, and in the case of Mullavy, quite excellent. The only trouble, really, is the generic and corny sounding music, which completely destroys ANY sense of foreboding or menace and really makes you yearn for the sort of spare sinister synth soundtracks that would become all the rage a few yrs later in almost all low-budget exploitation films.",1187136000,2,658,5.092592592592593
