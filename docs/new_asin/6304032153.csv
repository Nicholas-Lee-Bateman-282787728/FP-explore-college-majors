7859387,2,6304032153,While I  loved the timon and pumbaa series as a child I can't review the episodes on here due to the tape itself getting stuck in and breaking my vcr to the point we actually had to find a replacement. Also even for a used copy the box was in really bad shape i'll update the review when I get a new copy of the tape.,1474416000,,317,3.803030303030303

This is the sixth and final volume in the series. A great way to end the videos with this tape. It's a tape definitely for die hard Disney and Lion King fans.",1346112000,,255,4.3125
