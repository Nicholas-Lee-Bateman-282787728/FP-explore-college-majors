8204463,5,B000S60TJI,"This well produced video helped convince my daughter that school would be a happy, fun experience.  It's a montage of actual footage portraying a typical school experience, from saying goodbye to mom to going home.  Kids narrate, talking about how they feel about their teachers, friends, reading, art and other school elements.  No particular school activity is overemphasized, so it's no big deal if your own child's school day won't include a bus ride or lunch or whatever.  It appears to have been shot at several schools.  It's scrupulously diverse, with images of children, teachers and school workers of all races and both genders.  We used it when my daughter was 3 and entering junior kindergarten; seems it would help kids to age 6 or so.",1231632000,2,748,4.896825396825397
