8085942,3,B000BF2KCK,"Star Wait is a documentary about a group of hardcore Star Wars fans who have gotten together through  the website liningup.net and have been literally camping outside of Graman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood for 2-6 weeks in anticipation for Star Wars II:  Attack of the Clones.

  The documentary features the experiences for several of these men and women.. Some have found love, some have met people they can not stand (and yes, this DVD features some of that drama).  Focusing on the friendships, the making of lightsabers, how people can get volatile without decent sleep and the complaint of bad body odor.

  Also, you get to see the news crews interviewing the fans and Christians reaching out to these fans through music.

  One of the most interesting scenes is when a group of punks began badmouthing the Star Wars fans and among the ""Star Wars nerds"" is a very muscular individual who knocks out one of the instigators after being pushed.

  Needless to say, Star Wait is not for children. This DVD features profanity, mooning and adult humor.

  One scene featured the fans getting tattoos and a girl jokingly talking about getting a tattoo of Darth Vader on her butt and open the crack to find a tattoo of Annakin during anal sex.  Let's just hope she's really joking.

  As for DVD quality, it was shot on DV and it's a documentary.  Menu layout is plain and simple.

  The DVD does feature plenty of special features which include Star Wait Again which features a short  look at the lineup for Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith (which the film was not even showing at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre but out of tradition, many fans wanted to partake in the final Star Wars lineup).

  As for other special features, plenty of deleted scenes and celebrity DVD commentaries from Amy Allen (Aayla Secura of SWII & SWIII), three original members of Mystery Science Theater 3000,  Samm Levine and John Daley (Freaks and Geeks), Jason Guy of Big Brother 3, Paul F. Tompkins of Mr. Show, Paget Brewster and Dana Gould.

  All in all, the DVD's intention of filming a documentary on hardcore Star Wars fans who wait  and camp out in line for hundreds of hours to watch a film is accomplished.  It's actually pretty fun to watch.

  If you have an open mind and want to see a perspective of Star Wars fandom, definitely check this DVD out.",1220400000,3,2345,4.654411764705882
8085943,2,B000BF2KCK,"I went to the Star Wars Celebration III convention last April and waited in line all night to see George Lucas. So I understand the geek inside all Star Wars fans to want to wait in line for a Star Wars film. I don't think I'd wait weeks though. But more power to those who do!

Anyhow, I found this film interesting, but surprisingly it doesn't have much to do with Star Wars. It's more about certain people in the line and what they had to put up with for the few weeks they were out there. It's more of a reality TV show than a documentary on Star Wars fans. And ultimately, I found myself not caring much for some of the fans, so I wouldn't really watch it again.

Worth checking out, but I'd recommend ""A Galaxy Far, Far Away"" for a much better documentary about SW fans.",1135296000,3,776,4.166666666666667
8085944,3,B000BF2KCK,"Okay.  I couldn't resist.  I was walking up the DVD aisle in the local Target the other day and I saw this DVD for $2.99.  I said to myself, ""You've got to be kidding me.  How did this movie ever get marketed?""  But, I soon found myself, copy in hand, waiting in the checkout line.

Upon playing the movie, I was worried.  It took quite a while to get introduced to all of the ""important players"" in the line and, for the first half hour, I was pretty bored and didn't think I would make it all the way through.  But then, as time rolled on, I found myself getting absorbed in the lives of these people who had travelled to Hollywood in order to stand in line for six weeks.  There is plenty of drama in this reality-based movie, as the people get pretty frazzled by each other after being in a closed space for weeks on end with one another.

Some of the characters are funny, some are laid back, and some are real jerks.  It is hard to watch a film that tends to focus on the jerks, lovingly following them around to pick up on the random rants and tantrums they throw about various issues.  You just end up wondering what these guys problem is.  But fortunately, there is other content in the film to make up for these tense moments.

In conclusion, I'm not sure why I found STAR WAIT interesting.  One sort of wishes to follow up on these folks and see where they are and the included ""sequel"" to the film is not enough.  It seems sad that the energy is gone, even if these individuals are a bit geeky and can spend six weeks of their lives waiting on a street corner.  If you are a Star Wars fan, you should get the movie.  If you are a fan of reality tv and documentaries, you will also find it strangely entertaining.  And hey, for under five dollars, you can't go wrong.",1133049600,4,1778,4.191740412979351
8085945,3,B000BF2KCK,"If you have ever wondered what fellow Star Wars fans do when they wait all of those weeks in a line to see the Star Wars movies, then this movie is for you. Star Wait is a documentary on just that, people waiting in line to see Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. On this movie, fans are followed as they spend days and weeks in line and the movie ends when they go into the theater, with their thoughts of Episode II during the end credits. This is more interesting than it may sound. While they wait in line, they are confronted by onlookers and a fight actually breaks out towards the end. The fans themselves are interesting, especially Grimlock, he rocks! George Lucas phones in and calls the fans in line, his voice isn't heard but it is told that that's who's speaking.

But, this is not a movie for underage kids. Foul language flies all over the film, with the occasional butt moonings thrown in to boot and anti-religion comments are made. So you may want to be a little catious before viewing in front of a younger audience.

Overall this movie is pretty good, it tries to be Trekkies but falls a little short of the goal. One of my favorite parts is when the Star Wars singer plays his guitar to the song ""The Ballad of Han and Leia"". It's a catchy song indeed.

This DVD comes with extras; an hour of deleted scenes, Star Wait Again: Waiting in Line for Episode III, and commentary by various celebrities such as Joel from Mystery Science Theater 3000.

So I do recommend this movie, especially for the people who I mentioned who were like myself wondering what the fans who wait in line do for all of those weeks. I think it's only available at Target and it's worth getting because it only costs $5.99. To have an almost hour and half movie with extras, it's worth $6 for sure",1132099200,3,1799,4.361194029850746
8085946,3,B000BF2KCK,"This is available at TARGET stores for $4.99 (look for it next to STAR WARS Episode III, which incidentally comes with a TARGET-exclusive collectible coin) and is a fairly interesting look at crazy STAR WARS fans as they wait in line to see STAR WARS Episode II.  The language is often pretty foul, so this is absolutely NOT for the kids.  There's plenty of bonus material, but it's rather boring.  The feature itself is watchable, but there is no footage whatsoever of the fans actually getting to see the film.  Copyright issues are probably to blame, and you do see that the theater won't even allow cameras into the lobby, but after all that build-up of seeing the fans wait outside the theater, there's no real payoff.  The only evidence that they've even made it in to see the film is a few brief clips during the credits where a handful of fans talk about the film after leaving the theater.  Still, if you must have any and all DVD documentaries on STAR WARS, this disc is well worth a trip to TARGET and $4.99 plus tax.",1130889600,6,1028,4.470588235294118
