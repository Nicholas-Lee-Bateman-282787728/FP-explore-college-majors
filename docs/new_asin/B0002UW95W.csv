2120816,4,B0002UW95W,"Yes, what you've read is true -- this collection offers only the FULL-FRAME versions of both films, no widescreen. The Spanish 5.1 audio for the original is now just in 2.0 stereo, and while the bonus disc is nice, you won't find any really well-developed features that last very long. If you want Shrek 3D (only 15 minutes), then buy it used with the original full-frame Shrek for a cheap price, since this is the ONLY way to get this short-film so far. The movies do deserve 5-stars, even in full-frame, but the lack of extras and no widescreen version of the the two feature films knock this pacaked down one star. If you just don't like widescreen -- this is the ultimate package for you. Everyone else will need to buy them individualy to get want they want. Sorry, hardcore fan.",1099267200,83,784,4.528169014084507
2120817,3,B0002UW95W,"One of the reviewers comments that the Dreamworks website shows that the set is widescreen.  I can't find that information on either dreamworks.com OR Shrek2.com

But if you check out [...]

They seem to have the information correct and it looks like only the 3-D feature is in widescreen.  THAT is going to stop me from buying this set.",1098489600,23,337,4.661016949152542
2120818,4,B0002UW95W,"As far as I know, Shrek comes as a 2 disk set.  Disk 1 has the full screen movie, Disk 2 has the widescreen version.  I do hope they have a widescreen version of ""The Story So Far.""",1098144000,3,181,3.736842105263158
2120819,5,B0002UW95W,"FYI, the amazon product description says this is full screen.

Later note added: Thanks Amazon for updating the information to properly describe that most of these discs are fullscreen (not wide)

2120822,5,B0002UW95W,"It's about time DreamWorks gave Shrek the full gift box treatment.  This should be a hot seller for the holidays.

Shrek 3-D is hard to find, where it was a promotional special when it came out in stores.  Basically, Shrek 3-D is a home video version of the Shrek 4-D attraction at Universal Studios Florida (and probably in California too).  It basically picks up where the first Shrek left off, where Shrek and Fiona are celebrating their ""happily ever after"" and Lord Farquard comes back to ruin their honeymoon.

While that film is only about 15-20 minutes long, the 3-D effects are really nice.  For the best picture, make sure you either watch it on a larger screen TV or sit up a little closer.  It obviously doesn't replace the whole theme park experience, but it is a very entertaining little feature.  If you missed out on owning it, here's your chance.

The other two movies are Shrek and Shrek 2, which you probably have heard about (unless you've been under a rock).  And at the price Amazon.com is offering it, I this is the right package to buy.  Truly, I think the wait is finally ogre.",1095206400,32,1102,4.543147208121828
2120823,5,B0002UW95W,"Why would you buy something then complain about it? It's clearly marked Full Screen. If you buy it full screen and movie plays in full screen then you got what you paid for. Or don't buy it.

2120825,1,B0002UW95W,"I've been waiting and waiting and waiting impatiently for Dreamworks to release this gift set in widescreen edition, but I guess I will just have to forget all about it! I still can't bring myself to buy Shrek 1 & 2 separately either. I guess no Shrek for me at the moment... :-(

Dreamworks, please take note that I pre-ordered this set at the moment it was announced, but sadly I had to cancel it. Fortunately it wasn't gone through the shipping preparation at that time. What a relief!

DO NOT BUY THIS SET BECAUSE IT'S JUST FULLSCREEN GARBAGE!",1105747200,16,547,4.515151515151516

2120828,2,B0002UW95W,"When Dreamworks released the first Shrek movie a few years ago, they bundled both the Full Screen and the Wide Screen versions in one single package. This time around I believe they have become a little greedy because the only widecreen version included is the short Shrek 3D film.
Very disappointing. A Deluxe box set should be... Deluxe !",1104105600,13,340,4.779661016949152
2120829,1,B0002UW95W,"I wish I'd come here before I bought this set.  I found out too late they were all fullscreen, and of course, once opened these things can't be returned.  I've had to pay for the movies twice now, just to get the widescreen, and now I am really pissed off.  Kinda ruins the movie for me, now that I have to think about this every time I watch it.",1102032000,23,346,3.9855072463768115
2120830,1,B0002UW95W,"Amazon: If you sell a version that has been altered from the original, you MUST make that clear in the listing! It is not enough to mark the individual discs deep in the fine print.

I didn't pick up on the format problem until I glanced at the forum. I would not hesitate to return the package and demand a refund if I had ordered this thing by mistake. Thanks, all, for saving me the aggravation

Let's get this straight. I won't buy ANY full-frame edition (unless the original is 4:3) because I really hate the idea of some schmuck panning the frame and superimposing his/her sensibility over the director's. And the Shrek films are totally professional, not throw-away kiddie drivel. They deserve some respect.",1101686400,26,714,4.704
2120831,5,B0002UW95W,"Are you seriously fighting about this. It's a movie to watch for fun, not gripe over! Instead of getting all bent out of shape and telling someone to die, you big loser, maybe leave the review writing for those who are intelligent people.",1101513600,4,238,4.558139534883721
2120832,2,B0002UW95W,"First off, Brett - Stuff it! I'm stuck with a 13"" television with no remote and I still prefer watching Widescreen over full screen. In a lto of movies it makes a alot of difference. Especially in comedies where there's something happening in the background off to the sides. fullscreen versions just leave off a lot of jokes or interesting points in movies.

  I saw this set in stores and picked it up. I was really excited until I scrutinized the box (I've learned to do this before I buy a DVD) and finally found in REALLY smal print the specifications. I was really dissapointed to learn that There is no Widescreen (not even an anamorphic widescreen) version of this Box set. Why Dreamworks would do this is beyond me. I really wanted to get that bonus disc though which sounded good, but I already have Shrek 3-D and I'm not about to pay $40 bucks for one stupid bonus disc. I'll wait to see if they correct this huge flaw after the next movie and a Trilogy set comes out.",1101513600,11,979,4.397790055248619
2120833,1,B0002UW95W,"Why fullscreen only?  Any why does it not clearly statethis on the package?!! This is a major disappointment that I retruned becuase it was not widescreen. Why no widescreen version (i.e. the theatrical version kept whole)?  That's what the movie is supposed to look like.  Why supply only the chopped-at-the-sides fullscreen version.  Very, very disappointing!  Dreamworks release this set in widescreen and I'll buy it!",1101340800,12,421,5.415384615384616
2120834,1,B0002UW95W,"I just bought this package at Sams Club.  Upon further review, I noticed that the two movies are in fullscreen.  I did a search and could not find the Widescreen available anywhere for this package.  What a waste.  Guess I'll take it back and wait for a package to be released in Widescreen.

2120837,2,B0002UW95W,"If i remember correctly, Katzenberg was quoted in an interview stating that Shrek was planned as 5 movies in total. 2 are available so far. 3 movies more to go. The last movie is supposed to deal with how Shrek came to live in the swamp (prequel story).

Anyways, instead of double-dipping, we just have to wait until all 5 movies are out in a super-duper collector's set. And this time, hopefully, Dreamworks will get it right and release separate WIDESCREEN and fullscreen versions.",1099699200,53,484,4.761904761904762

For me, it was an inexpensive way to get all 3 quickly, but really you should be getting the WS versions for full content.",1099612800,5,366,4.515151515151516

2120842,1,B0002UW95W,I was so excited to be able to purchase this and rushed to the computer to do so.  I won't be buying it now.  Why make a big set of dvds with lots of extras if the films aren't widescreen?  What a waste!,1099612800,13,203,3.6744186046511627
