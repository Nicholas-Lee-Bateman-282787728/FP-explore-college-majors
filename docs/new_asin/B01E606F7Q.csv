7730432,4,B01E606F7Q,"I am always intrigued when a series I love is turned into a movie, so I knew Id have to watch Murder She Baked: Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery as soon as I heard about it.  After all, Ive been reading Joanne Flukes Hannah Swensen series since that book, the first in the series, came out.  As I expected, they definitely made some changes to the book and characters, but I really did enjoy it.

Hannah Swensen (Alison Sweeney) lives in Eden Lake, Minnesota, where she runs The Cookie Jar, a popular cookie shop.  The worst thing she faces is her mother Deloress (Barbara Niven) attempts to set her up.  The latest is the new dentist in town, Norman (Gabriel Hogan).

However, one day Ron LaSalle (Jason Cremak), the deliveryman from the local dairy, is late with the order for The Cookie Jar.  When Hannah goes out back, she finds Ron shot next to some of her Chocolate Chip Crunch Cookies.  Despite warnings from Mike (Cameron Mathison), a state detective brought in to work the case, Hannah starts poking her nose into the mystery.  Will she figure out what happened?

Despite the fact that I first read the book back in 2001, I actually remember the plot fairly well (my reread in 2006 might help with that), and Im happy to say the movie stuck close to it.  Im sure there were details and suspects they cut out for time, but it unfolded pretty much as I remembered it.  Thats impressive since they played up the new romances that begin between Hannah and both Mike and Norman here.

Of course, in almost any movie, the details are going to be changed.  I can sit here and start listing them for you.  Hannah lives in a house instead of a condo.  Lisa, Hannahs employee later partner at the bakery played by Juliana Wimbles, is too old for the character in the series.  And on and on.

But you know what?  It really didn't care.  Every time a new character from the series popped up, I smiled.  I was just having too much fun seeing these characters I love brought to life.  And there were plenty of great nods to the series in the movie.  I loved that all the desserts and cookies mentioned have been made it in the series.  While the actual recipes are missing (obviously), we even heard the secret ingredient in the title cookies.

The characters were a tad off from how I picture their personalities, but I think that was a result of the acting.  Everyone just seemed a tad over enthusiastic.  It was the style they were going for, and as I got in to the movie, it didn't bother me nearly as much.

No, this isn't a great movie, but it is fun.  If you are a fan of Hannah, youll enjoy it.  And if you are looking for a light, fun mystery, then Murder She Baked: Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery will fill that need and leave you craving the books.",1462233600,8,2750,4.3881188118811885
7730433,5,B01E606F7Q,"A Chocolate Chip Murder Mystery is the first in the series of Hannah Swensen movie mysteries by Hallmark.  The book is actually based on the first book in the Joanne Fluke series about the same character.  As I have not read the books in the series, I cannot say whether or not the movie stays true to the book, however, in reading the synopsis of the book, it seems pretty similar in overall theme.

The setting for the movie is a small town in Minnesota and the casting of Alison Sweeney for the character of Hannah seems really spot on.  She brings a real gung-ho spirit to the character that makes it easy to believe that she could start up her own successful business and evade her mother's match-making attempts at the same time.

I was thrilled to see that one of my favorite actors from a variety of Hallmark movies is an integral character in the movie, Cameron Mathison plays Detective Mike Kingston.  Detective Kingston is called in from Minnesota to investigate the murder of Hannah's good and lifelong friend who is the local dairy deliveryman.  I really enjoyed Mr. Mathison in The Christmas Ornament, a Hallmark Christmas movie from 2014.

Hannah decides to investigate her friends murder and keeps crossing paths with the detective  who warns her repeatedly to stop getting in harm's way.  Unfortunately, Hannah chooses to ignore the warning and, as expected, gets in harms way before the movie ends.  The relationship between the two characters is both believable and enjoyable.  I also loved the way Hannah would talk issues out with her cat.  I think a lot of us with pets do something similar.

I really did not figure out the whodunnit until the reveal though there were hints left in the movie.  Once the reveal happened, I thought, well of course so and so was whodunnit!  I enjoy it when a movie or book can stump me as I have been reading and watching mysteries for a long time and it doesn't happen very often anymore.

The series fits right in with Hallmark's family friendly genre and is a good alternating series in their new movie line up on Hallmark's Movies and Mysteries channel.  I now check every weekend to see if there is something new and fun to watch.  Half the time, I'm now drawn in to an older, classic mystery movie or series so it has quickly become one of my favorite channels.  I'm looking forward to more movies in this series and for other series that are running or are in development for the future.",1461369600,22,2449,4.599078341013825
7730434,3,B01E606F7Q,"Most cozy murder mysteries now have some kind of overarching theme -- tea, knitting, bookstores, needlework, florist shops, weddings, coffee, soup -- and are usually set in some quaint little town full of quirky people.

So somehow it doesn't surprise me that the Hallmark Channel has decided to pounce on some of these cozies for TV-movie adaptation, especially cozies like Joanne Fluke's Hannah Swenson series. ""Murder She Baked: A Chocolate Chip Mystery"" is a pleasant little whodunnit about a baker determined to find the person who killed her friend, but inevitably finds herself in way over her head. Also add two cups of love triangle and a teaspoon of family comedy, and bake until golden brown.

Hannah (Alison Sweeney) spends most of her time running her quaint cookie shop and dodging her mother's attempts to get her married off to the eligible new dentist Norman (Gabriel Hogan). But when she finds her old friend Ron shot dead behind her bakery, Hannah can't believe that anyone would want to kill Ron -- or that anyone in idyllic Eden Falls could be a cold-blooded killer. So she begins investigating the crime herself.

This inevitably causes her to butt heads with new-in-town detective Mike Kingston (Cameron Mathison), who is currently investigating the murder on an official basis, but Hannah is convinced that her knowledge of Eden Falls' people gives her insights that he doesn't have. But as she winds her way through a tangled web of pink lipstick, loan sharking, mysterious black cars and a second corpse, she may just end up in over her head.

""Murder She Baked: A Chocolate Chip Mystery"" is roughly what you'd expect from a Hallmark Channel murder mystery -- it's not very dark or deep, and it happily immerses itself in the charming small-town locale with quirky good-hearted residents and lots of comfort food. This is a story that would fit in easily alongside the Cabot Cove episodes of ""Murder She Wrote,"" because despite the presence of dead bodies and murderers, it always feels comfortable and cozy, like a well-worn sweater that smells of cinnamon.

The murder mystery is also woven in with some comedic cliches, such as Hannah fending off her mother's attempts to marry her off to an eligible man, and hints of a brewing love triangle between her, the amiable dentist and the detective with a tragic past. The story isn't terribly complicated, so it sometimes happily veers off into little side-plots like the other women of Eden Falls (including Hannah's sister and mother) itching to put Hannah in sexier clothes and give her a proper makeover, before swerving back into the hunt for Ron's murderer.

However... it felt like something was lost in translation from novel to TV movie. Specifically, while there is a clear motive given for why the second victim died... I don't remember any actual explanation for why Ron was killed. And the second victim's death doesn't make much impact because we never actually see him beforehand, only hear that he's cheap and nasty.

Alison Sweeney does a pretty good job as Hannah -- she's quirkily charming, although the talking-to-her-cat thing is a bit much. And she is particularly good at showing Hannah's doubts about what she's doing and whether she's screwing everything up, especially since she is clearly not very experienced at this whole mystery-solving thing. The rest of the cast also does a fairly uniformly decent job -- nothing particularly good or bad, but serviceable.

""Murder She Baked: A Chocolate Chip Mystery"" is a pleasant little cozy mystery with enough cookies to give you diabeetus, even though the adaptation seems to lose some vital details. But it's enough to make you want to return to Eden Falls.",1461369600,5,3705,4.974151857835218

Yeah, I know that all movies take liberty in making it the way they want. But seriously, they didn't have to have Hannah be so different. Why is she a runner now? Why not a redhead?

7730463,5,B01E606F7Q,"I'm so surprised at how much I loved this series! It is indeed a ""cozy"" mystery. Besides the great chemistry between the two romantic leads, I really liked her relationship with her sister (Gotta have good sidekicks for a truly ""cozy"" feel). I also liked that their mother is presented as an overall harmless but nonetheless slightly snooty woman. And the dad is dead. I know I certainly can't relate to characters who have perfect relationships with both of their parents, LOL.

And as for the romance, what single lady out there doesn't wish a guy like Cameron Mathison shows up in her boring town and falls in love with her? I also liked how it was portrayed. While there was an attraction from the start, Mathison's character was still focused on a job and wasn't just unrealistically falling all over himself to be with Hannah right away (like in the Aurora Teagarden series). It develops over time.

I will say that I find it a little off-putting how, in these cozy mysteries, murder is sort of glossed over. It's just a plot device for the heroine to solve a mystery, get into some hijinx and fall in love. That's why I liked the show Cold Case, because it centered the plots around the actual people who were killed and made you feel for them  more (even though they're fictional).

Speaking of which, how realistic is it that five seemingly sane people in this small and otherwise quaint town have all been driven to murder within, what, a few months? A year? That's a crazy amount of murders for a town that's small and generally low on crime, and it's not even like the victims are drug-dealers or other people you expect might get killed because of their dangerous lifestyles. It's always just some secretly angry/jilted/greedy townsperson turning to murder after an apparent life free of crime. I know that's a known critique of this type of fiction, not just the MSB series, but I just thought they might find a way to make it a little less formulaic, given that reputation for cozies. Does it always have to be murder? What about a missing person? A jewel heist? A strings of arsons? Not sure what the fixation is on murder, and that's why it concerns me that people will become desensitized to it with this sort of treatment.",1516147200,,2241,4.609022556390977

In any case, it sure isn't the rural minnesota portrayed in the book, and shes no Hannah swenson. I like the actress well enough, but whoever wrote her character was way off base. Her age, look, habits, apartment, her shop even her cat is all wrong. And she runs every morning?! Hahaha!! She was lucky if she was fully awake and dressed before she went out the door. She was always late in a messy, cliche, thrift store sweatshirt and worn out jeans with frizzy unkempt hair (lisa was the one who was on time and ran the place). And they screwed up Norman too. What happened to the short, balding slightly pudgy sweetheart? Replaced with a 6ft, fit handsome dude with no receding hairline. Im sorry but these details are important and this movie missed the mark big time. They took waaaaay to many liberties. Very sad. If you really like the book, you shouldn't watch this hack piece of crap. And in typical, shallow hallmark fashion everyone is over botoxed, gorgeous and beautifully groomed and dressed and there is corny music playing throughout the ENTIRE movie. Its annoying.

7730488,5,B01E606F7Q,"This film Murder She Baked; A Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery is an enjoyable film to watch and it was fun guessing what was to become of Hannah Swensen (Allison Sweeney). Swensen played a very courage baker who goes above and beyond what most people would die in order to find out who murdered her friend Ron Lasalle (Jason Cermak). As a matter of fact, Swensens dangerous work catches the concern of Mike Kingston (Cameron Mathison) who sees the good in what Swensen is doing yet is also understandably concerned as how she might be putting her life in danger. Hannah Swensen is also popular with both her coworkers and many people in her town because she bakes very delicious cookies, cakes, and other sweet treats. Swensen also has a very close relationship with her mother Delores Swensen (Barbara Niven) and is also close to Andrea Todd (Lisa Durupt). Of course, there are other key players in the Murder She Baked film yet my intuition is indirectly influencing me to avoid listing more names due to me wanting to be considerate of people who have yet to see the film and may want to see Murder She Baked: A Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery.",1499558400,,1143,4.663366336633663

Utterly aside from the tiny fact that this lady is a beautiful woman, she is talented, carries her persona with skill and casts just the right aura for Hannah Swensen. I believe we realize that in real life none of these sleuthing heroines would get to first base interfering in a serious law enforcement investigation of a murder, BUT...that's the fun of the movie and reflects the skill of the author, script writers and the actors. They are good enough to enable us to suspend our sense of reality while we enjoy a good production. Buy all of these ""Murder She Baked"" productions...you can watch them over and over and never get tired of 'em.

7730501,4,B01E606F7Q,"I watched a Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery as the first part of the Australian Region 4 DVD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Murder-She-Baked-4-Movie-Collection/dp/B06XQKFNRB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Murder She Baked 4 Movie Collection</a>.  I watched the second movie A Plum Pudding Mystery straight after and the two are pretty interchangeable, just different murdered people.  I'll try and keep this review to the first movie but some stuff may be blurred a little as to which movie they were from since they were so similar and formulaic.  The movies are based on Joanne Flukes' novels, with the same central characters for each.  It felt more like watching a TV show whose episodes just go for 90 minutes, than a couple of movies to me. They are the sort of movies where the central character faces danger but you know nothing will happen to her. This one differentiates itself from other series because the main character runs a bakery, she's single, middle aged, and doesn't care that she is those things, content to talk to her cat each night.  However her meddling mother does care about those things and wants her to find a man before it's too late and if Hannah isn't going to do it herself, the mother will do it for her. These are made for TV movies, so are pretty mild with the murder scenes which are pretty much just an actor lying still with a blood splotch on their clothing.

A Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery wasn't really a mystery, as you aren't given all the facts to solve the crime before the character eventually discovers things near the end of the film.  Hannah's friend since they were kids, who is also the town milkman, is late showing up with their order.  They need the milk as they're about to run out of cookies, milk's a vital ingredient.  When she's goes out back to call him, she finds his truck and his corpse inside.  He had turned up on time, but somebody killed him.  Her sister's husband, a cop, calls in a homicide detective from a bigger city who annoys her and is blunt and rude to her about her meddling in a murder investigation whenever he catches her doing so.  But he's so handsome though, so you know how this sort of story goes.  Her mother has also sidetracked her investigation by constantly trying to hook her up with the new dentist in town, who may also be a suspect.

The movie geared towards the target market which is the same as the books, they are female romance fantasy of wanting to have two handsome men competing for their attention.  The casting have gone with the probably not done as much as it should be thing of casting middle aged actors in the roles, your traditional blockbuster Hollywood film would have had Hannah and her sister played by actresses in their early twenties.  Oddly their mother is played by an actress who has obviously spent a lot of time in the plastic surgeons office, when the character isn't mentioned as someone trying to look her daughter's age in, well at least this and the Plum Pudding movie.  I think her role would have worked better with a regular looking old lady as the face-lift stretched face is a bit of a distraction.

Other distractions are that the kitchen part of the small eat in bakery is huge compared to the public area that doesn't seem to have many customers.  I'm not sure if it was this or the Plum Pudding movie but at one point the assistant in the shop take a large tray with freshly baked items on it straight out the oven with her bare hands and doesn't even mention owww that's hot or seem affected, just continues on with the conversation she was having. In the opening scenes she is going for a run when it's light and other people are out and about, don't bakers have to start baking early in the morning? A customer also brings a dog into the bakery already a health violation and then Hannah plays with it and pats it.  We don't see if she washes her hands afterwards but you'd assume not. She takes some cookies and other baked goods to the homicide detective in his hotel room including a babka, and he asks what that is.  She does not reply with ""what you haven't seen Seinfeld?  Should't you be asking if it's chocolate or cinnamon?  What about is there a hair on it?  You know I never wear a hairnet in all the scenes of me in the bakery.""

I'd give A Chocolate Chip Cookie Mystery three and a half stars. I haven't read the books, maybe I'd get more out of the movie if I had.",1492387200,,4462,4.589420654911839

I took off one star for something many people will think is trivial- her long hair is hanging down freely in every single baking scene.

Sweeney is just too pretty for the role but she does have the personality for it.

Watching her peddle her baked goods as she searches for clues is so funny, especially when it doesn't work out as she expects.  These Murder, She Baked mysteries are so entertaining.

I was worried about Allison Sweeney playing the lead, because I didn't really like her that much on ""The Biggest Loser"".  But she played Hannah very well and I really liked the movie.  If you are into Hallmark type of books, you like these.  If not, maybe not!  All the Joanna Fluke books with Hannah as the main character I've listened to on audio, so the move was a perfect transition.  Hannah runs a bakery in a small Minnesota town, and she always stumbles across and finds herself in the middle of murders, and gets herself into a bit of trouble, then ends up solving them.  Good prevails over evil.  My kind of story.  If you don't like the Hallmark movie recipe, you may not like this.  But it's nice people small town, friendly and good story with a good plot.  Allison does Hannah well, I was impressed with her acting skill.  I will watch every one.  I listened to this audio book and it was like it was brand new.

I think you could count on one hand the number of times the books say Hannah exercised.  Her cookie van is old and beat up and she knows she needs a new one but still tries to keep this one going just a bit longer. I don't think I'll buy any more of these.

I haven't seen an ad about another one for this year but I really want one.  It would be hard to wait until next year for another movie.,1470528000,16,423,4.036144578313253
