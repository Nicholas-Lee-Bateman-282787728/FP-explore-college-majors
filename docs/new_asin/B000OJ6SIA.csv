8185422,4,B000OJ6SIA,This isn't the best quality movie you'll see however it is very watchable and plenty of great 70's cars and action. Well worth buying.,1391817600,,134,4.625
8185423,4,B000OJ6SIA,"Having finally viewed Speedtrap i can honestly say that it's surely one of the most underrated car chase films of all time. Combined with decent performances by topline actors in Joe Don Baker and Robert Loggia, they really help bolster the movie along. The stunt driving is superb and rivals the action scenes in 'Gone in 60 Seconds' and 'Vanishing Point'. The downside is the picture and sound quality, which overall is very ordinary and deserves a big restoration for a DVD RELEASE. This is a real must for the car chase enthusiast, so please, some production house should clean it up and bring it out on dvd.",1308268800,3,612,4.675925925925926
