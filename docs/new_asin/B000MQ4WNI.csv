2738421,3,B000MQ4WNI,"I know that Batfink is really more of a satire than a true action adventure series for children but there are times when the episodes get really repetitive. Every episode the same catchphrases are repeated and Batfink's superpowers come out at just the right second. One has to wonder how he gets captured. Does he forget he can use his super powers or does he just like getting captured.

If you are into nostalgia and you saw the show as a kid or, like me, saw it on Boomerang then by all means check it out. It's just too corny and predictable for the rest of the population.",1259539200,,578,4.351851851851852

2738423,3,B000MQ4WNI,Still quite entertaining but definately a kids cartoon.  I bought it as childhood memoribilia and it's worthwhile for that.,1238889600,,123,5.473684210526316

2738425,3,B000MQ4WNI,"I remember watching this show in the early 70's in black and white as a kid. Great to now see it in color, and in great quality.

Sound and picture quality is great, viewed on an 86cm plasma.

Would've given it 5 stars, but I'm a bit dissapointed with how they've re-edited the opener.
I remember it started off with Karate and Batfink in the Batalac coming out of a cave. The theme song (which was sung) started like ""The Batalac is ready is a wonder car...etc"". This is not there. No singing opening. It's all cut with different music and shortened. It's such a real shame as I thought I was getting the classic Batfink shows. Why did they do this? I was really looking forward to it.

A friend told me that the real opening is on YouTube. I checked it out and it's there. See it for yourself. This is what I was expecting to see on the DVD. The show, as it was.

The menu actually features the real opening music that was at the end of the theme song that was over the title of the episode.

I think each cartoon goes for about 6 minutes. I'm not sure because the disc doesn't display any time or chapter details(really weird), and I timed it with a watch without a second hand.

Nice packaging but I find the discs are always displaced when I open the case. (Two discs per 'soft thin' case, so they are very close together. Just be careful that one of the discs doesn't drop out. Easy to do.)

I'm still glad I purchased this DVD because of the show that I loved long ago. They're still fun and I actually got a good laugh from some of them, but didn't think it was worth $32.00.",1189728000,10,1583,4.1875
2738426,5,B000MQ4WNI,"Excellent!!! Each episode was a campy but hysterical five-minute parody of the then-popular ""Batman"" TV show. The animation was cheap and simple, only two guys did all the voices, and yet this is one of the funniest, most under-rated cartoons of all time. It's all there; Batfink's supersonic sonar radar; his sidekick ""Karate"" (a fat bumbling jujitsu expert), arch-enemy Hugo-A-Go-Go (a very crooked mad scientist), and all the corny but clever jokes. There's still something quite hip about Batfink, in a 1967 kind of way. I'm glad this official version is finally being released in the states. Highly recommended, although as you can probably tell by my name I'm a bit biased.",1174262400,27,679,5.071428571428571

2738431,5,B000MQ4WNI,"I have to rank this up there with Danger Mouse as one of the funniest cartoons ever.  Remember the Nickelodeon show Weinerville?  It was a show about a guy named Mark Weiner who interacted with puppets, most of whom had real heads.  It was pretty funny, especially the Barney parody Boney, a dinosaur skeleton who hates kids.  But my favorite part was when they showed a cartoon towards the end.  They started off with the original Alvin & The Chipmunks cartoon.  Let me just say that while I liked it as a kid, the only part I still like is the episodes with Clyde Crashcup.  I have to admit that whenever he interacts with the Chipmunks themselves its funny too.  But then they stopped showing Alvin thank goodness & replaced it with this.  I instantly loved it.  I could not get enough of Batfink & Karate fighting Hugo A Go-Go and various other villains.  I always thought his steel wings were really cool.  One of the most disappointing moments of my childhood TV was when Batfink was replaced with the similar funny animal superhero cartoon Courageous Cat & Minute Mouse.  Now don't get me wrong that was not a bad cartoon.  In fact, it was good and much better than Alvin & The Chipmunks but it still wasn't Batfink.  But now I have it on DVD & can watch it whenever I want.

Amazingly, its as good as I remember it.  This is just great campy fun.  Like Danger Mouse, the laughs are constant and great, while never feeling mean-spirited.  I especially love the punny names of some of the villains, like the Superman-parody Stupid Man & the mad bomber Napoleon Blownapart.  But my favorite villain will always be Hugo A Gogo.  I have to admit, hes a much better arch-nemesis than Baron Greenback from Danger Mouse.  He doesnt need henchman to play off of in order to be funny, he IS funny.  Like I said, Batfink is my favorite funny animal superhero next to Danger Mouse & he is by far the best one to come out of the 60s.  Underdog and the aforementioned Courageous Cat & Minute Mouse were good, but Batfink was always the best, particularly because I really cared about the characters.  The cliffhangers on Underdog never bothered me, but those moments where the Batfink Narrator paused the action to make jokes were just unbearable back in the day.  Of course now they're one of my favorite parts because the Narrator makes especially funny jokes during them & you know Batfinks going to be alright, but when you're a kid you don't know that.  Oh yeah, thats another point in Batfinks favor, the Narrator.  One of the problems with Underdog is that the Narrator is too serious.  If you're going to be a comedy and you have a Narrator, it should be a funny one.  Batfinks Narrator isn't as good as Isenbaed in Danger Mouse, but any interactive narrator is good and he offers more laughs in any single episode than Underdogs Narrator does in the whole show.  And to top it off, Batfink even has an origin story.  Its only revealed in the last episode, and it doesnt answer every question but its more than Underdog got.  I recommend this to anyone who likes comedy cartoons.  I must admit you should probably try it before buying because its probably not for everyone.  But if you like campy fun, you will love it.  The only bad thing about the DVD is that it is missing the theme song.  I will admit that its not as memorable as Underdogs theme song but it was still pretty cool.  Otherwise, this is fantastic.",1394323200,2,3418,4.506514657980456

2738435,5,B000MQ4WNI,"I just ordered my copy.  I will not watch it until the first Saturday morning after receiving it, while eating a bowl of Captain Crunch Cereal (I don't really like cold cereal anymore, and that's the only one I can eat and enjoy).  And for a couple of BATFINK episodes, I'm going to be a kid again!

DVD's like this should be viewed for the same reason that you view family photos albums, to bring back good memories.

I can, 'vaguely' remember me and the other young boys on our block playing 'super hero' and getting into fights about who would be BatFink, because we all wanted to be him.  I know it sounds stupid, but we were kids.

We didn't have jobs, we didn't have to pay rent our go to work yet.  Our biggest problems were homework and waiting for Christmas to come.  That's probable one of the 'biggest' reasons for retro shows like this continuing to have a small, yet fanatically loyal fan-base.  They remind us of simpler times.

By the way, I purchased this 'new' from a second party vendor on this site, not Amazon like I normally do.  I really do want a copy of this show, but I'm not going to pay thirty dollars for it.  You can buy a newly released movie for less than that.",1283472000,2,1192,4.2959641255605385

8170624,3,B000MQ4WNI,"BATFINK: Batfink was Hal Seeger's colorful animated tribute to the Caped Crusader, chronicling the adventures of a no nonsense rodent equipped with impenetrable wings and super-sonic sonar radar to locate criminal hideouts. Alerted to evil doings via closed circuit TV in his split level cave, he battled helium-voiced mad scientist Hugo A Go-Go, plus one shot baddies including Robber Hood, Skinny Minnie, and the Sonic Boomer. His klutzy sidekick was Karate, a Kato-like martial arts expert who carried an assortment of handy gadgets in his kimono sleeves, and drove the Battilac, a tricked out pink VW bug. Each cartoon contained a Batman-like cliffhanger trap (complete with ominous voice-over narration) in the first half and a miraculous escape during the conclusion. This cheaply made program encompassed one hundred six minute episodes with a high reliance on recycled footage...Karate hiding behind Batfink while he proclaimed, ""Your bullets cannot harm me. My wings are like a shield of steel!"" was featured in almost every segment. Like those other ""lost"" sixties classics Roger Ramjet, The Mighty Heroes, and the Super 6, Batfink's kitschy take on the super hero craze will elicit grins, groans and gobs of golden after school memories.
