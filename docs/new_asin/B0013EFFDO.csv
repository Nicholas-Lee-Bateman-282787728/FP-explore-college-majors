8250445,1,B0013EFFDO,One long unending shot of helicopters with narration that is too low to hear well backed by an annoying droning noise.,1320451200,,118,4.666666666666667
8250446,1,B0013EFFDO,"One of the lamest UFO docs I've ever seen.  Consists of somebody with a camcorder taking video of a helicopter flying around (I guess supposedly surveiling the person with the camcorder) while voice recordings of telephone interviews with various people are played.  The people being interviewed, or the interviewer, are not even identified.  I rented this on my $10 gift promo for registering my Roku and I still felt ripped off.  You couldn't pay me to watch this piece of .... again.",1283212800,,486,4.890243902439025

This is the best doc on big brother harassment i ever seen.
Well Done.
Takes courage to say what everone else will deny!",1223164800,,164,4.32258064516129
8250448,5,B0013EFFDO,"For some people seeing a UFO is just the beginning of their problems.
Are certain UFO witnesses under official surveillance and have they become an unwitting threat to national security?
Are some abductees being intimidated by helicopters and monitored by Air Force planes?
Are their safer and more open minded countries to live in?
Disturbing evidence of what happens when Big Brother gets involved!
If UFO's are not real then what's with all the official attention?
There is help and hope available through the rite connections!",1204761600,,530,5.174418604651163
8250449,1,B0013EFFDO,"This is one of the worst documentaries on the ufo subject I have ever
looked at. The tipoff was the credits at the beginning of the dvd listed the same person involved in all aspects of the production. That being
executive producer,design coordinator,music writer,director,editor
and so on. That person being Al May. The production company is Mayan
Animations. Stay away from any dvd with their involvement.
  This is the most limited visual experience of any dvd I have ever
watched! There are 4 narrators on this documentary among them is Stanton
Friedman & Nick Pope both of whom I highly respect. The narration was
ok but nothing I hadn't heard before. My main criticism was the total
lack of any variety of visuals to this production.
  The whole film revolved on helicopters flying in the skies & aircraft
spraying chemtrails. That was it!! Totally mundane to say the least.
  Talk about a cheap production with an extremely tight budget!
  You never got to see the 4 narrators talk live & in person. You
just got to see a still picture of each one as they did their individual
presentations.
  Consider yourselves forewarned. If you buy this,you will kick yourself!!
