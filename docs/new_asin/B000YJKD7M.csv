8233116,5,B000YJKD7M,"My 4- and 6-year-old grandchildren received Trip Flix as a gift.  It is far and away their favorite DVD, which they request to see over and over again.  As a camp director for over 30 years, I was particularly impressed that 3 generations of our family equally enjoyed Trip Flix, beginning with these little ones, and we all learned something new! The ""fun"" factor is tops and the interactive aspect allowed each viewer to have their own experience. Our family highly recommends it for all ages--as a gift, you can't miss!",1207094400,2,522,4.725274725274725
8233117,5,B000YJKD7M,"We sat down to watch the video with our two kids and they couldn't get enough!  The next morning, the first thing they asked was to watch it again.  Emily and Alex are so fun to watch -- my kids both laughed out loud throughout the show.  The interactive segments were great too -- my kids had a great time guessing the answers and often got more right than mom and dad!  The video is a great way to introduce geography and history, learn more about possible vacation destinations, or just have some family fun together.",1204502400,,520,4.385416666666667
8233118,5,B000YJKD7M,"I am a retired librarian who has heard rave reviews about this DVD from a friend.  My sister-in-law recently bought it for a nephew.  Tripflix is a delightful gift for children, grandchildren, and children-at-heart. We  enjoyed armchair traveling to many places we have never been, learning facts about parts of our country we never knew.  Some of the scenes were so exciting and comical, I bought it for my third grader, grandchild's birthday. TripFlix is a great asset for any school or public library.  Children in the USA, even those in other countries, will enjoy learning  something about our geography and culture, having great fun along the way.",1202688000,,653,5.0
8233119,4,B000YJKD7M,"My nephew and niece watched the show without bothering me once while on our road trip.  They really enjoyed the enthusiasm of the actors.  I only wish there were more destinations included in the DVD.

Great concept.",1201564800,,216,4.783783783783784
8233120,5,B000YJKD7M,"I received TripFLIX as a gift from a friend. After sitting down and watching it with my girlfriend (who loved it more than I did) I felt like I had just completed a trip across America and hit all the necessary places to make the trip worth the while - some places I didn't even know exist or would think to be as interesting as they were! The two stars, Adam and Emily, are great together and add a lot of fun to the educational content.  Even though I can see this as being directed to a younger crowd, I found it thoroughly enjoyable.

My only complaint is that it's all over too soon.  Though there are 2 hours of content on the disk, when it's all over, you're left wanting more.",1201392000,2,684,4.166666666666667
8233121,5,B000YJKD7M,"Gave it to my grandchildren and they loved it. Beforfe giving it to them, I left a child watch it that I babysit and she really enjoyed it.  Her parents travel alot with her and her sisters and she seemed to get alot out of it.  Thank you for such a nice gift idea.",1200268800,,265,3.888888888888889
8233122,5,B000YJKD7M,"Tripflix is great fun!  My kids want to watch it again and again and don't even realize how much they are learning.  They learn factual and historical information about our 50 states in an enjoyable way, and Tripflix makes them want to travel to the destinations shown all over the county.  The DVD reinforces what my kids are learning in school.",1199664000,2,346,4.639344262295082
