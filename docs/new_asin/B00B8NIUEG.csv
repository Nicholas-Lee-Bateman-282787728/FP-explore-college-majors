It shows pretty much all aspects of manufacturing wood products as applies to from the forest, logging to trucking it to the mill and then processing it at the mill. It's done in a way that's interesting to children and all of the heavy equipment is impressive to kids. The footage is of actual skilled laborers, but actors. I can't really understand why the one VHS copy available is over $200.00, that's just crazy. The original copy that I picked up back in the nineties was damaged, but I was lucky enough ti find one on Amazon last year for under $20. I suppose it's not in production anymore, but over $200.00 feels like robbery lol. Sure wish it was still in production and even better wish it was available in DVD or blue ray. I'm rambling, but this is better than any Thomas the Train or Bob the Builder business.",1514592000,,934,4.3428571428571425
