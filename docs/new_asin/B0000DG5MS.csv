8000880,3,B0000DG5MS,"Thought I was getting a dvd but apparently unknowingly ordered and received audio-only 2-cd set.  Is this even available as a dvd region 1 (USA)?  All the DVDs listed on Amazon are ""region 2""  and will not play in most USA machines.  Eddie's comedy is rather visual with his expressions and style, but so far I'm happy with the audio-only cd until a region 1 dvd is found.",1520467200,,372,4.426470588235294
8000881,1,B0000DG5MS,No stars. Description not clear this DVD is in the European format and does not work on most US players.  Waste of money.,1443139200,,121,4.260869565217392
8000882,5,B0000DG5MS,It was a gift.  She's a big fan of his and absolutely loved it.,1421280000,,63,3.5
8000883,4,B0000DG5MS,"It's Eddie Izzard. Even though this falls short of some of his other DVDs (like Dress to Kill), it's still Eddie and it's still funny. It was a surprise to see him with boobs!",1390348800,,175,4.176470588235294
8000884,1,B0000DG5MS,"It does not work,it will not load in dvd player, it just reopens. I tried it in other dvd players. I did not want to pay to return it. It would cost me more than I paid for it!",1353110400,,176,3.5384615384615383
8000885,5,B0000DG5MS,"Eddie is always great.  I personally feel this is not his best.  But anything he does isokay by me!
He's in a classy himself, way above any comedian I have ever seen.  Personally I think
he's the sexiest comedian around, if you have my taste.",1341878400,4,242,4.333333333333333
8000886,3,B0000DG5MS,"Let me start by saying that I love Eddie Izzard. I flew to Chicago from the South just to see this show. it was not that good. I mean yes there are some funny parts because its Eddie, but over all not good. But I told myself that maybe it was because it was early in the tour. then I got my hands on the video and even tho it was a COMPLETELY different show. still his worst one by far. on a brighter note I just saw his new tour ""Stripped"" last night and it was GREAT.",1214438400,5,469,3.795918367346939
