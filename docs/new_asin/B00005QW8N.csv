1652116,5,B00005QW8N,"Under Fire, 1983 film

When the popular revolt in Nicaragua against Somoza attracted world attention in the late 1970s, many journalists went there to report the news. One journalist made world news when he was murdered by government forces, and another reporter filmed this event. This 1983 movie weaves this incident into a story about those days.

The scene in Nicaragua starts with a parade. Rebels infiltrate and hoist a banner; the military chase them. This is photographed by a journalist who climbs on top of a parked car. (NEVER park your car by a parade route!) The rebels invade a night club, a grenade goes off, and then Russell ""visits"" the police station. A ""businessman"" gets him released, and then suggests that Russell visit the provincial capital where the Sandinistas are active. Russell photographs the action, and gets involved. The pitching skills of a Nicaraguan are used, but he is soon retired from this game.

Back in the capital Somoza announces the death of the rebel Commander, Rafael. Russell visits this province to photograph the news. He meets the rebel leaders, and agrees to photograph Rafael in a live setting; others in the rebel camp are photographed. The movie shows how ancient DC-3s are used as military weapons. Alex returns and asks to visit Rafael. Russell discovers that his photos are being used to identify and eliminate the rebels! When Alex can't find Rafael, he wants to do a story on the ""businessman"". But Alex is prevented from doing this by unidentified soldiers. Russell photographs this, but escapes with his life. The film gets back to the hotel, and is published. Somoza flees the country, and lands in Miami. And so it finally ends happily? Or does it? Could such a movie be made today?

The romantic triangle (older man, younger woman, younger man) reminds me of ""The Quiet American"".",1437609600,,1844,4.919614147909968
7951282,5,B00005QW8N,"One of the great movies set during days of revolution. Under Fire is set in Nicaragua during the revolution to overthrow Anastasio Somoza. While strictly historical fiction, (it incorporates historical truths while simplifying many things - like the FSLN having a single charismatic leader - which they didn't have.) Gene Hackman is incredible in this. It's easily one of my favorite Hackman films. Nick Nolte, Ed Harris, Joanna Cassidy all are superb. There is action, several wonderful character studies that ring true for any journalist. It is also a thinking movie. You have to follow along, it's not an all fast paced blow 'em up action movie. Under Fire is a classic that is vastly underrated.",1479340800,,699,5.0344827586206895

7951290,4,B00005QW8N,"A window into the murders that took place by fascist leader Anastasio Somoza and his order-following henchmen as seen through the fictional eyes of a US photo journalist and his press ""associates"" (lover, friend and husband of lover). This is a fictional account no doubt of ABC journalist Bill Stewart who was murdered in 1979 by the Contras in Nicaragua.

I would give it five stars if it weren't for the fact that the CIA's role in Nicaragua is downplayed magnificently. There is one lone confirmed French ""spy"" but the CIA is never really mentioned once (I may have missed it if it was). So what was the CIA's role in this conflict? Not only did they supply guns etc to the Contras but they funded their gifts by running drugs into south LA (and later other parts of the US) in what was the worst drug epidemic in US history. That's right, the crack epidemic. Anyone who wants to read about that should pick up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Alliance-The-CIA-the-Contras-and-the-Crack-Cocaine-Explosion/dp/1888363932/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Alliance: The CIA, the Contras, and the Crack Cocaine Explosion</a>&nbsp;while you still can. You will see that not only was the CIA responsible for millions of deaths, tragedies, trauma, bloodshed etc etc etc, but the Reagan white house was TOTALLY complicit in ALL OF IT. ""Just say no"" my frickin behind. Let all of you blind, naive Reagan ""patriots"" (""oh, he was such a great president bla bla bla duh."") read that book and tell me he was a ""patriot."" Go ahead, I dare ya.

I'm getting off point a little ha ha ha. Not really. This is a pretty good movie and Nick Nolte, Gene Hackjob, Joanne Cassidy and Ed Harris (the quintessential merc/psychopath/murderer) turned in great performances. Even though they probably knew they weren't telling the whole story. Hey, it's payday in Holly Wood, right?",1477180800,,1902,5.212418300653595
7951291,4,B00005QW8N,"High production value  and excellent location filmography. Ed Harris steals the show and that's Holly Palance, Jack's daughter.",1475452800,,127,6.055555555555555
