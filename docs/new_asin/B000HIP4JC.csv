2637949,4,B000HIP4JC,"I just wanted this movie because Jake Thomas and some of my other favorite actors were in it. I read that it's like Goosebumps and Are You Afraid of the dark... I love those shows, so i'm sure i'll like this movie also.",1366329600,,219,4.116279069767442
2637950,1,B000HIP4JC,"Monster Night was a horror-comedy for kid produced by National Lampoon's and it looked kind of interesting. Looks are of course deceiving and this movie was a bomb. I don't think kids would even like this movie. It's cheesy, the effects are awful, and the acting is so over the top that it just destroys any credibility this film may have had. There are movies without a plot, that are hard to follow, that are boring, and so forth, but this, this was just all-around terrible!",1361491200,4,477,4.558139534883721

2637953,1,B000HIP4JC,one of the worst movies i've ever seen. I don't recommend this for kids or anyone for that matter. This movie doesn't even deserve one star !,1287446400,4,141,4.2592592592592595
2637954,1,B000HIP4JC,"What a huge waste of money! I bought this movie thinking it would be a fun family movie and was so incredibly dissappointed. The acting is horrible, the special effects are not at all special and it is quite innappropriate with a little boy participating in a game of strip poker with some teenagers. I really wish I had not purchased this. One of the worst movies I have ever seen!",1284422400,7,382,4.394366197183099
2637955,4,B000HIP4JC,"It does start out a little bit boring.  You do need to watch from the beginning and the school scenes are very important even when he is getting off the bus.  I really liked most of the film.  I could watch it over and over.  However,  some of the scenes with the 5 year old should of have been either edited out or touched up.  I found those scenes to be inappropriate.  So,  I would recommend this for 13 years and older including adults.  Because of those bad scenes I am giving it a rating of 4, instead of a 5.  What really surprised me was the very ending.  It also leaves some questions opened.  Like what happen the next day at school?",1231632000,6,643,4.138211382113822
2637956,1,B000HIP4JC,"I've seen some really awful kids' halloween programs but you could tolerate them as ""cute"" - this movie has NO REASON to be released, acted in, or even on this planet.  It STUNK!  The acting was beyond horrible and the adults in the movie should be institutionalized. Please don't purchase.  It belongs in the trash!",1203724800,4,316,4.709090909090909
2637957,5,B000HIP4JC,"If you are a fan of Goosebumps or Are You Afraid of The Dark, this movie is for you!  I am nearly 40 years old, and I had a ball watching this movie.  Don't expect a deep plot, just some spooky fun!  Silly scares are the best kind, and this one delivers.  Also try the Halloweentown series or Disney's Tower of Terror dvd.",1167264000,18,322,4.063492063492063

8139767,3,B000HIP4JC,"I gave it 3 stars for this reason...if you are a grown up...like me....you will find it childish, strained and pretty badly done. If you are a kid, say up to 8 or 9. You will love it. I was bored.",1416182400,,196,3.8048780487804876
8139768,3,B000HIP4JC,it was ok,1407974400,,9,2.3333333333333335
8139769,4,B000HIP4JC,"...if you're in the mood for a ""spooktacular"" Goosebumps-like horror film that's fun & silly and not scary at all. It's like Scooby-Doo but without the dog.

Released in 2006, the story has to do with a family who moves to a castle-like home in a new town, which turns out to be haunted and somehow linked to the creepy local school. When the parents (Robert Carradine and Vanessa Angel) go out for the evening the three kids have a Halloween party and the younger brother goes missing. To find him, the two older siblings team-up with the top jock of the school and his girlfriend; misadventures ensue.

The requirements of a film like this are obvious: A good assortment of youthful protagonists, from kids to late-teens? Check. An equally good cast of adults? Check. A quasi-horror ambiance? Check. A fun, silly spirit? Check. Corny, but funny humor? Check. A simple story with a sense of adventure? Check. An assortment of good-lookin' women, young and older? Check. An energetic and rockin' soundtrack? Check. A runtime that doesn't overstay its welcome (like the Pirates of the Caribbean films)? Check.

Nuff said.

8139770,1,B000HIP4JC,"I purchased this dvd so my kids and could watch it together. After asking them to cover their eyes and ears about 10 times, I finally gave up on this movie.  It was extremely inappropriate for my children and it was so boring. We love Halloween and spooky movies such as: Mostly Ghostly, Halloweentown, Mom's Got A Date With A Vampire, Hocus Pocus,etc... this doesn't even come close. I would NOT recommend this movie for a family. Boring and inappropriate. Don't waste your money!",1378512000,,481,4.726190476190476
