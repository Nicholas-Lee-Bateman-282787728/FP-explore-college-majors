The best the movie has to offer would be the vehicle and environment miniatures. They look nice and are what stuck most in my mind over the years. The music isn't bad either.
I rented Return of the Dinosaurs several times as a kid, and knew I had to get it when I saw it was being sold on Amazon.
If you enjoy dinosaurs, anime, and/or cheesy movies, then you might want to give this a shot.
I wasn't going to give the plot, since there isn't much of one, but here goes: An asteroid goes past Earth, its gravitational pull causing earthquakes that bring ancient plants and dinosaurs to the surface. The ancient creatures are dying in our atmosphere, so a team of scientists assemble to capture and relocate the dinosaurs.",1496880000,,913,4.473053892215569

When I was a kid, I was going through the Warehouse and found this title sitting in the kid's section.  I grabbed it and watched it constantly until we had to return it.  I must've rented it enough times to have bought 10 copies, I just loved it.

For a me, it had everything.  Dinosaurs, Cartoon characters, Dinosaurs, toy models that would drive around, DINOSAURS!  I remember wishing I had some of the vehicles they drove around in to have as toys.  I loved this cartoon hard.

Then one day Warehouse stopped carrying it, and I forgot about it, and eventually Warehouse disappeared from our neighborhood.  But every once in a while I'd remember a small detail about the show and it would make me yearn to see it again.  However, I forgot everything about it, including the title.

Fast forward 15 years later, and I decided that I would try to find this thing or just never sleep for the rest of my life.  Luckily, I found it after searching all over the internet for it a few hours into my venture.  ""Return of the Dinosaurs""  and I even saw screenshots, which over filled my heart with joy.  When I saw Amazon had it, I bought it immediately.

Sure.. things have changed quite a bit, but it's charming.  The terrible voice acting, the cheesy dinosaurs, some animated with clay or with a sock puppet, and the timing in the show was very slow for some reason.  I remember watching it and there'd be weird pauses as characters talked to one another.  My favorite part was when the main character was talking to this other guy, and it cuts to the other guy.  He's about to begin his dialogue, and faintly you can still hear the other voice actor talking as if they were recording the voices in the same room and the editor never heard that faint voice in the background and they never took it out.

LOVE IT.  Maybe it's just something I grew up with, but I loved this.  Infact, it's technically the first anime I ever saw as I look back on it.  I love this cartoon, and I don't care if anyone disagrees with me.",1334707200,2,2038,4.387700534759358
7882782,4,6305107289,"I used to own a copy of this movie when I young.  I will strain my hardest to recall it in its entirety :)
While the exact premise of the plot is somewhat hazy, the movie follows the adventures of a team of ""dinosaurs rescuers"" (who are represented as 2D Manga cartoon characters) who go out saving dinosaurs caught in bad predicaments (the dinosaurs are convincing looking Toho-style men in rubber suit treatments, the environments are all excellent Japanese monster-miniatures).  I know it's hard to imagine, but try to picture a cross between Voltron and the Japanese ""Godzilla"" movies and you've got it.
The film itself is compelling and fascinating - totally unique, even in today's dinosaur crazy days.  Of course its utterly inaccurate - some of the dinosaurs are larger than skyscrapers - but ultimately it's a pretty intense and, sometimes, creepy and scary feature for a low-budget children's movie.  The bizarre mixture of 2D-animation and live-action dinosaurs make it a worthwhile animation collector's item.
Definitely for the cult-classic fans :)  It's no ""Jurassic Park"", hell its not even ""One Million BC"", but its still enjoyable and very fascinating from a production standpoint.  Check it out if you can spare the cash!",979603200,,1239,5.078817733990148
