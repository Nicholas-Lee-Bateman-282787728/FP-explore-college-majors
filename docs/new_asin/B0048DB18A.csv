8418645,5,B0048DB18A,"Apocalypse Now is without a doubt, in my opinion, one of the top 10 best films of all time. It's no coincidence that Francis Ford Coppola also produced two more of the top 10 best films of all time (in my humble opinion), which is The Godfather, and Godfather Part II (III sucked). Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In America and Once Upon A Time In The West (aside from all Eastwood's spaghetti classics), are ALL films that even if you stream -- you should have BD copies of in your library. Because they have all the components of great stories, great suspense (for their genre), great acting, great cinematography, and of course great directing. Apocalypse Now is better (in my humble opinion) than the Redux version, because Redux (also included in this set and the 3 disc version, too) breaks away from the real character arc that most represents Martin Sheen's character; a cold blooded, mechanical ""regular Army"" assassin the Brass brings in to finish the job that the first choice failed to do. So stealing surf boards from Academy Award winning Robert Duvall's character is not in character, and rightfully was left on the editing room floor for the original release. However, Redux has the ending that justifies the film's buildup: ""Exterminate Them All"", which unfortunately is left unfinished in the script and in the viewer's conclusions of the original. Nonetheless, as far as war films and struggles of the ""human heart"" go, this film is easily within the top FIVE of all time; and worth revisiting every time some idiot runs you off an exit ramp on I-95.",1433203200,,1570,4.775735294117647
