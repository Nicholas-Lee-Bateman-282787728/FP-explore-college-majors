8349338,5,B0021O1M2I,"This and season 2 are both out in Australia with the other seasons to follow soon. This is in the PAL format but all you have to do is go to Walmart or right here on Amazon and get the Philips brand DVD player in the white box with carrying handle for around $35.00 which you can set to ""region 0"" in the menu. Once you've done this you can watch any DVD from around the world. This is the best and funniest of the Nick toons from the 90's. Very twisted!!",1272067200,15,455,3.9565217391304346
