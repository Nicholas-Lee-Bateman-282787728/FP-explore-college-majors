8125687,5,B000FQISRQ,"this won't be a long review this volume covers the episodes leading up to the finale before the conqueror of shamballa movie.
for those newcomers the fullmetal alchemist anime aired around 2005 on cartoon networks adult swim block.
the overall synopsis is a story about two brothers (edward and alphonse) whose meddling with alchemy backfired horribly and they must go on a journey to attempt to undo the consequnces of their actions.
its a heart warming tale full of action drama and humor worth watching. as for if brotherhood is better that is debatable for me both versions of the show have things i like such as this version has more of the character ""lust"" while brotherhood had another awesome female character named oliver armstrong.(sister to alex louis armstrong the strong arm alchemist) that doesnt appear in this show aside from a reference that armstrong has a sister.
in this volume two of the homunculi are defeated (i won't say who in case some one is watching the anime for the first time)
and we learn more about the philosophers stone in al's care (presumably people are watching these dvds in order if not oops :p )",1480377600,,1136,4.771573604060913
