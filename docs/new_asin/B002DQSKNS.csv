8365829,5,B002DQSKNS,"One of the things I love about horror conventions is getting to ""discover"" an author or film maker that I really enjoy that I would not have known about otherwise. In this case, it is Tony Wash. I picked up ""It's my party and I'll die if I want to."" I was drawn to this because of the ""choose your own adventure"" feature on the second disc (which I haven't had the chance to use yet). The movie itself was very entertaining. The monster/ghost effects were really cool, which is not surprising since a lot of the crew graduated from Savini's special effects school (Savini actually makes a cameo). The story was enjoyable and really had a more intense version of an 80's haunted house movie feel to it. I even found myself enjoying the scene where we are given a demonstration of the protagonist's martial arts skills (had a very NOES 4 feel to it).  I would really recommend this to any horror fan, especially fans of 80's and 90's horror.",1377907200,,939,4.459302325581396
8365830,2,B002DQSKNS,"This ultra cheapie concers(though I must say I wasn't all that concerned) a group of high school kids who decide to throw a birthday party for one of their friends on Halloween night.  They set up in a house whose previous owner had imprisoned his family inside and then murdered them.  Sounds a tad like Hell Night already, eh?
Betchya can't guess what happens after the kids arrive to set up!!!  Correct!  The previous owner shows up in zombie creature mode and kills everyone.
This is one of those films that looks like a home movie.  While I'm not always opposed to that if the story is good enough, this one looks exceptionally bad.  It's very dark and fuzzy and just looks awful.  There's a fair amount of gore, but nothing too special.  Some have commented on the naked women looking unappealing, but to me they look like real women as they aren't slathered in makeup to make them look like Playboy models.  Tom Savini shows up in a very small and pointless cameo for the only purpose of the filmmakers to show off that they could get Tom Savini to show up in their film.
The only think fairly creative here is between the scenes there are comic book panel interludes moving the plot along, a la Creepshow.  It's kinda cool and shows that the filmmakers at least knew they were making schlock and probably having fun with it.
All in all, I'd say stay clear of this one.  You're better off with Hell Night, Night of the Demons(the original of course) or Police Academy 4: Citizens On Patrol.",1318550400,,1497,4.507407407407407
8365831,1,B002DQSKNS,"I love horror, but you have to wade through a lot of garbage before you find a true gem, a diamond in the rough, etc. This movie had excellent reviews, a cool title and I found it on Netflix.

Now every bad horror movie I've seen always gets compared to ""Flesh Eating Mothers"", the 1988 cinematic abortion that I consider ""THE WORST HORROR MOVIE EVER"". However, after seeing It's My Party... we have new a champion.

Where to start, how about when I press the play button to start the movie, I get taken to the audio setup menu. When it finally starts, I realize this is the worst looking movie ever. This is 3 steps below amateur. This is 3 steps below a high school tv class production.

The f/x are bad, the murdered family in the beginning is down right laughable. The plot is similar to Night of the Demons and countless other copycats where you have a party at a house where bad things happened a long time ago. The only difference being is that this one reeked on every level.

My head hurts just thinking about this ""film"". I finished watching it about 10 minutes ago, and I'm angry I'll never get back the 75 minutes I spent watching this dvd. I could've done something great with those 75 minutes like cure cancer, fix social security or make a sandwich.

The guy who made this movie, Tony Wash, should be hung, drawn and quartered. Better yet, he should be stripped, raped and strangled.

Even the boobies couldn't save this one...",1280620800,4,1442,4.443181818181818
8365832,5,B002DQSKNS,"Yes. Tony Wash is a genius, for a ultra low budget movie this movie is pure gold. You will not be disappointed with this flick. Check out the trailer for his new movie ""A Chance in Hell"" on you tube, it looks absolutely amazing!",1274227200,3,228,4.204545454545454
8365833,5,B002DQSKNS,"This is what a true horror film is all about...helpless young students in a haunted house.  It may be a low budget flick but it definitely is a quality film for horror fans.  I recommend this to anyone that enjoys this genre...it is so much better than many of the high-budget, high-priced movies out there.",1269129600,6,307,4.5636363636363635
8365834,5,B002DQSKNS,"wow!! this movie blew me away! I watch allot of scary movies with my girl and this one by far has the number one spot as of late! I like old stuff that my dad turned me onto like the original wolfman and Dracula!! this new one coming out ""shutter island"" with leonardo is going to probably top this one but..... not yet!! i hear this director is going to be poppin up with something new soon!! good luck my friend!! you got skilz for sure for sure!
can't wait! Thanks Riley A.S.",1264377600,3,478,4.150537634408602
8365835,4,B002DQSKNS,"Rarely does a low budget horror film come along that exhibits what Party does, the first scene is a bit tough to get through as you quickly notice the ""shot of video"" feel, but just as quickly that goes away and the execution and talent in the film shows through. There are very few movies out there with the type of interactivity that Party has, and this is one of the best. Having a hand in the film directing the outcome easily makes this one of my fav. movies. The makeup fx are top notch and rival any big budget horror film.

Recommendation: buy this movie!",1254787200,3,563,4.311320754716981
8365836,5,B002DQSKNS,"this movie is fantastic.  It really brings back the fun of some of the 80's monster movies like NIGHT OF THE DEMONS and SUBSPECIES.  It makes numerous homages to classic horror films and just adds a ton of gore, nudity, and fun.  The best part is that due to the CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE feature on it you can rewatch the movie numerous times and get something new out of it each time.  Definitely pick this up and watch with some friends.",1253059200,9,440,4.329268292682927
