277133,5,6300247236,Though surounded by two veteran actresses in this mega star trio cast Dolly Parton steals the show. Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin play alonside Dolly in this film about women in the work place.  Dolly Parton was oscar nominated for the title song she wrote for this film. It is only one of many highlights made by Dolly in this film.  This is a must see and must buy film with a great cast!!!  END,890956800,,394,4.226666666666667

277320,5,6300247236,"Review of 9 to 5
Hot Toasty Rag, September 30, 2017

Dabney Coleman is the boss. Under him are floor manager Lily Tomlin and personal secretary Dolly Parton. They don't get any respect, and neither do the other female employees at the company, even though hes less competent than most of his underlings! When Jane Fonda, fresh from a divorce, enters the workforce and gets a taste of his attitude, the three ladies commiserate and become close friends.

For any woman whos been disrespected by her boss, felt the pressures of being the breadwinner in the family, or been unfairly treated at work, this movie will be your new best friend. Its absolutely hilarious, but with enough realism to make you feel the sting alongside the characters. Dolly Parton was nominated for an Oscar for her catchy and true-to-life title song, and shell win you over in the first three minutes of the film. Lily Tomlin becomes the poster child for feminism as she delivers powerful speeches, and Jane Fonda is adorable in her frumpy wig and oversized glasses. On her first day of work, shes reduced to tears because she doesnt know how to work the copy machine. Anyone, man or woman, whos ever had a first job will relate to her in that scene.

9 to 5 will keep you quoting Patricia Resnick and Colin Higginss screenplay long after its over. Youll pout to imitate Dolly and say, That hurt my feelings! and puff out your chest declaring, Hit the road Buster; this is where you get off! like Janeand youll never look at your coffee sweetener the same way again. This is a great chick flick, and a must-see for any working woman.",1506729600,,1607,4.611888111888112

The ""girls"" taking over the corporation is a good storyline with the promise of plenty of entertainment along the way, but the directing and shenanigans definitely puts this in another era for me.",1505952000,,335,4.859649122807017

277360,5,6300247236,"Dabney Colman plays Franklin Hart Jr. He is working hard at being the typical manager of an office with a small business on the side.

Mr. Hart can not understand what is happening to him. It seems that everything he does backfires. Violet (Lily Tomlin) ""his right-hand man"" gets upset because he promotes someone that she trained, instead of her. After making overtures to the married Doralee (Dolly Parton), she threatens to turn him ""from a rooster to a hen"" with one shot.

The ""girls"" get together and fantasize different ways to dispose of Franklin. Dabney Coleman outdoes himself in the scene where they are hunting him down.

Later Violet may have put ""Rid-a-Rat"" in his coffee, which leads to a great hospital scene. Violet says, ""I'm no fool. I've killed the boss, you think they're not gonna fire me for a thing like that?!"" He eventually spends time literally hanging around Judy's (Jane Fonda) house while the Trio of women get the goods on his side business of pilfering from their company.

Will the girls get way with their plans or is Hart too smart?",1502928000,,1067,4.720430107526882

277484,5,6300247236,"9 to 5 is a brilliantly executed, classic comedy about three ladies, deftly played by Fonda, Parton and Tomlin, seizing the opportunity to give their despicable boss, the equally wonderful Coleman, a taste of his own medicine. Although technically a dark comedy, it's hard to call it that, since it's so lighthearted and fun throughout. My 13 year old son wasn't interested in watching at first, but when Parton said her quotable ""rooster"" line, he was all ears! We laughed together multiple times throughout the rest of the film, and I honestly can't think of the last time we both enjoyed a film so much. We highly recommend it!

Parents of younger kids should note that this film was given it's PG rating in 1980, before the PG-13 rating was developed in 1984. I'm certain that if released today, it would be rated PG-13 for language, mild/fantasy violence, mild drug use, and possibly adult themes. Still an excellent film for teens and adults!",1492300800,2,948,4.815950920245399

277883,5,6300247236,"These ladies are still amazing! This movie is among those rare films from a specific time period that really hold up over time. I'm also including Tootsie in this category (Dabney Coleman was in both, too). Sadly enough, women in many companies still go through these things today and are still dealing with the Mr. Harts of the world  you know the type  sexist egotistical lying hypocritical bigots! This film is so funny, yet underneath, there is a moving story of the struggles women go through and they cover a lot of these struggles: entering the work force again after divorce, single parenting, inability to move up in a company or receive equal pay because you are a woman, dealing with unwanted sexual advances, and many other topics that still affect women in the workplace today. In fact, I really don't know how much progress we've actually made in the time this movie came out until now. On the surface progress has been made, but underneath, all of these things are still going on.

In any case, the ladies take their fantasy revenge scenarios a bit too far and go off the rails a bit in the process, but it's oh so funny to watch. The scene where Judy (Jane Fonda) tells her ex-husband (who left her for another woman) that if she wants to do ""m and m's,"" that's her business and the scene when Doralee (Dolly Parton) fantasizes her revenge on Hart by turning the tables on him are just hilarious. The whole thing is extremely hilarious. The Maui Wowie scene - oh my gosh - when they're devouring all the leftovers in Doralee's refrigerator. . .

I must say the writing is amazing and that's what sets movies like this apart from others of the time period because it focuses on the people and not the times or the trends. There is also a lot of physical comedy required for Dabney Coleman's character, which he performs with great authority.

It's just a great film and still very relevant today. If you somehow missed this back in the day, please watch it now.",1476748800,2,1976,4.554929577464788

A wonderful reflection of the professional status of women thirty or thirty five years ago.  Not to be missed.",1454544000,,337,4.387096774193548
278565,5,6300247236,"As an FYI to start, my reviews focus on the DVD offering and not so much the movie as I always figure people already know if they want a particular film or show already.  I figure everyone already knows this is a fun movie to watch, so I'm concentrating on this edition of the DVD which is top notch.

This version comes in the typical keepsake box.  The DVD itself is nothing fancy and has just basic artwork without any images of the stars.  The DVD played perfectly throughout.  It's a nice widescreen print, too.

The extras are good.  My favorite is the commentary that includes all three primary cast members -- Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton.  Producer Bruce Gilbert also participated, but to be honest, he was overshadowed by the women and most of the time, I think he was happy just to enjoy what they were saying.  The wonderful part is that the three really seemed to be having a good time watching the movie again.  While I believe they were actually not together in the same room, they were watching the movie and laughing as they recalled shooting the movie.  It was like double laughter, chuckling at what was on screen and laughing at the same time at what the actresses were saying, much of which was spoken in laughter.  It was just a good time having the commentary on during the film.

There is also a making of featurette and a short tribute to the director, Colin Higgins, who died in 1988.  In addition, there is a gag reel as well as several deleted scenes.  I love that there is a 'play all' function to watch all of these scenes.  Lastly, there is a karaoke piece so fans can sing along to the famous theme song.  All of these were interesting extras that included the main female stars and others involved in the production.

This DVD was purchased very inexpensively as well and was well worth the price I paid.

Put everything together, and it's five stars.",1454457600,,1897,4.478134110787172

Now I live in a retirement community, and I still love it!  It is the dated story of three women--a ""perfect"" housewife with no wage-earning skills whose husband has dumped her for a bimbo, a mother of teenagers who is the real force behind the smoothly running office, but whose boss takes all the credit due her, and the sexy but naive secretary whose work is adequate, but who was chosen for her charms.  Her boss is much more interested in her short skirts than her shorthand.  I don't think the outrageously unfair conditions are as common today, but I think they were when the movie came out.

And now I am a senior citizen and that has been to my advantage--not being able to remember most things about this movie--was almost like seeing it for the first time. What I do remember is laughing my butt off when I saw it the first time and that didn't change this time when I saw it again. These 3 talented actresses were hilarious in the roles that they played. I do have to say that it seemed strange to see Jane Fonda play such a passive person--I am use to seeing her a little more aggressive. But even so, she played this role perfectly. And Dolly Pardon, did a great acting job. One of my favorite parts of the movie was when she cornered her boss and threatened to turn him from a roster into a hen! What can I say about Lilly Tomlin--she was in good form as she always is. The ending could not have been any better. I am so glad that I watched this movie again because everyone can use a good laugh and this movie kept me laughing the whole time I watched it.

279652,5,6300247236,"9 to 5 is a 1980 American comedy film written by Patricia Resnick and Colin Higgins, directed by Higgins, and starring Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Dabney Coleman. The film concerns three working women living out their fantasies of getting even with, and their successful overthrow of, the company's autocratic, ""sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot"" boss.  No one could have played Dora Lee except Dolly...Lily Tomlin was the best as a take control multi-tasking, I can do my job with my eyes closed supervisor and Jane Fonda was perfect as a beaten down been out of the work force forever recently separated woman. These three bond together to show the Boy's Club how it's done.  Another favorite. Dabney Coleman continues to play the character of a chauvenistic, male boss who thinks that his sh*t doesn't stink. He gets his comeuppence too in a way that is unexpected.  This movie is just as relevant today as it was in 1980...can you believe it debuted 35 years ago!! Some things never change.

SPOILER ALERT

Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda) is forced to find work after her husband, Dick (Lawrence Pressman), squanders their savings, loses his job and runs off with his secretary. Judy finds employment as a secretary at Consolidated Companies, a very large corporation. The senior office supervisor is the feisty widow, Violet Newstead (Lily Tomlin). Violet shows Judy the place, while warning her about the two higher-ups. The first is the sleazy, selfish Franklin Hart, Jr (Dabney Coleman); the latter is the crisp but equally obnoxious Roz Keith (Elizabeth Wilson), Hart's executive assistant and resident snitch. Violet reveals to Judy that Hart is supposedly involved with his buxom secretary, Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton); in reality the married Doralee refuses his advances, but Hart nonetheless leads other staff to believe that they are having an affair.

Hart exploits and mistreats his subordinates regularly. He takes credit for Violet's efficiency proposals, while refusing to promote her on the basis that ""clients would rather deal with men when it comes to figures."" He cruelly yells at and threatens Judy on her first day after an equipment malfunction. He sexually harasses Doralee, and spreads false rumors that they are having an affair, damaging her credibility with coworkers. Finally, Hart casually fires a worker named Maria over an overheard discussion on salaries.

When Violet discovers that another promotion she'd been hoping for has instead gone to a man she herself trained, she confronts Hart about his manipulations and sexism. She then references Hart's claims of his purported affair with Doralee (which Doralee enters the room just in time to hear) before storming out, announcing that she needs a drink. Doralee, previously unaware of the rumors and now realizing why her coworkers have been cold to her, informs Hart that she keeps a gun in her purse and warns him that, up until she just learned about the rumors, she'd been forgiving and forgetting what Hart has previously done, because of the way she was brought up, and if he ever makes another indecent reference about her, she will change him ""from a rooster to a hen with one shot"". She also angrily leaves the office, also proclaiming that she needs a drink.

Judy, upset that Maria has just been fired over a trivial infraction, wants to inform Violet and is told that Violet is at a local bar ""getting drunk"". She joins Violet and Doralee, and the three women drown their sorrows together before going to Doralee's house. There, the beginning of the their friendship forms over dinner and smoking some marijuana that belongs to Violet's son. They fantasize about getting revenge on Mr Hart, with Judy wanting to shoot him execution style and mount his head on her wall, Doralee wanting to rope him like a steer, and Violet wanting to poison him (the fantasy putting her in the role of a cartoon princess).

The following day, a mix-up leads Violet to accidentally spike Hart's coffee with rat poison (a nod to her fantasy the previous night). However, before he can drink any of the tainted coffee, Hart accidentally knocks himself unconscious by falling backward from a faulty office chair, hitting his head on a credenza desk. On hearing he has been rushed to the hospital, Violet, realizing her error, panics, thinking it's due to the poison. After they arrive at the hospital, the three mistake a dead police witness for their boss. Violet, in a state of panic and desperation, steals the body of the deceased man and stashes it in the trunk of her car, convincing Doralee and Judy to join her, and the three drive off, planning to somehow dispose of the body so that there can be no autopsy. After a car accident, they discover they've stolen the wrong body, so they smuggle it back into the hospital.

Hart turns up alive the next morning, much to the shock of Violet, Doralee and Judy. During a break in the ladies' room, the three speculate on what could have happened and then vow to forget the night's troubles, but Roz, hiding in one of the stalls, overhears them and relates the conversation to Hart. He confronts Doralee with the information he has just learned, and demands that she spend the night at his house or he'll have all three of them prosecuted for attempted murder. Hart refuses to believe it was an accident, so the three kidnap him, with Judy firing at him with Doralee's gun (much as she had done in her fantasy), and Doralee tying his hands and legs with a phone cord (similarly to what she had done in her fantasy). Unsure of how to prevent Hart from alerting authorities, the three bring him to his Tudor-style mansion, keeping him prisoner in his bedroom while they decide to try to find something with which to blackmail him so that he won't have them arrested. The ladies discover that he's been selling Consolidated property behind their backs and keeping the profits for himself. To prove the crime, they need to wait several weeks for the accounting documents to arrive. In the meantime, the women fashion a special bondage device to allow Hart to move around, but keep him confined to his home.

Since Doralee is able to forge Hart's signature without difficulty, the three women use the occasion of their boss's absence to effect numerous changes around the office, in his name. These include allowing flexible hours, a job-sharing program that allows people to work part-time, and a daycare center in the building (while Maria, the woman whom Hart had fired, is allowed to return). All the while they conceal the true reason for his disappearance. As it turns out, Hart is so feared and/or hated around the office that nobody questions his absence, with the exception of Roz, whom Violet, under the pretext of the company, sends to the ""Aspen Language School"" to learn French.

One night, Judy discovers a prowler outside Hart's home. It turns out to be her ex-husband Dick, whose marriage to Liza lasted only a week. He tries to get Judy to come back to him until he finds Hart bound and gagged in the upstairs bedroom and believes, erroneously, that Judy has gotten into perverted sex games. Judy sends him away, admitting that she's into everything, even smoking pot, and that his departure was the best thing that ever happened to her.

Hart's adoring wife (the feeling is clearly one-sided) Missy (Marian Mercer) returns from vacation early, putting the ladies' plan in jeopardy. While still pretending to be the women's prisoner, Hart scrambles to replace the property he stole from Consolidated. He then takes Doralee's gun and directs the three women back to the office at gunpoint. Hart is appalled by the changes which have been made in his absence, even though all his employees are delighted with them. Before he can have the three women arrested, Hart receives an unexpected visit from Russell Tinsworthy (Sterling Hayden), the Chairman of the Board.

Mr Tinsworthy has arrived to congratulate Hart for increases in productivity, which are due to the changes the three women have instituted in his name. Hart is only too happy to take credit for everything the ladies have done. Tinsworthy is so impressed that he recruits Hart to work at Consolidated's Brazilian operation for the next few years. Hart is not pleased by this development, but is trapped by his lies. Moments after Tinsworthy and a fearful Hart depart, Roz returns from language school and is stunned to discover Violet, Judy and Doralee celebrating in Hart's office, and realizing that she now has to report to them.

A post-credits montage reveals the fate of the major characters. Violet was promoted to Vice President. Judy fell in love and married the Xerox representative. Doralee left Consolidated and became a country and western singer. Hart was abducted by a tribe of Amazons in the Brazilian jungle and was never heard from again.",1432080000,,8884,4.913333333333333

Accidental murder, a wonderfully-acted villain (Dabney Coleman's best role), 3 women overcoming the misperceptions that separate them, visions of revenge and liberation inspired by one little doobie, an anxious countdown to discovery, a macabre heist of a body from a hospital...this will make you laugh, laugh, laugh!

280159,5,6300247236,"Having been a child of the 1980's, one of the first of the ""Cable TV"" Generation, that's where I first saw ""9 To 5"". Although it doesn't age well these days, it IS STILL a GRAND example of some ""office politics"" that still exist here in the 21st Century. Also, it's a GREAT comedy, with some wonderful performances, especially from the 4 (yes, I'm including Dabney Coleman, in his one of his BEST character roles) leads. This is one of my fave movies of all time, and I give it my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION, as well as my personal one. I consider this one an understated CLASSIC for its time, and, as I call comedies that are many a laugh, it's ""an absolute hoot"".

If you've never seen this film, you're missing an understated 80's classic........CHECK IT OUT!!!",1426118400,,760,4.547445255474453

280205,5,6300247236,"I have always liked this movie and first time I saw it was on CABLE TV in the early 1980s. It's a great comedy about 3 ladies with different backgrounds working at a company (Consolidated) run by a few not so friendly male execs. The VP in particular, played by Dabney Coleman, (Midway, Tootsie, Modern Problems), is a man that thinks women have no place in the Administrative World as leaders. He even goes out of his way to continually ask his Senior Supervisor, played by Lily Tomlin to get coffee and gifts for him all the while trying to get it on and have an affair with his personal secretary, played by Dolly Parton. Jane Fonda, playing newcomer Judy Bernly, has never held a job in her life. All the Rookie mistakes she makes are hilarious, but eventually she gets the swing of things and becomes good friends with the two ladies mentioned above. They form a good friendship and find out what Franklin Hart, the Boss (Dabney Coleman), has truly been up to, embezzling the company and pocketing the money. All works out well in the end as the trio do some good things for a once dismal and depraved business for all employees.

This edition has some good features, for a DVD Edition. I loved them all, especially the 25th ""look back"" one and the ""Blooper Reel"". The original Theatrical Trailer is here also!",1425686400,,1315,4.548523206751055

Dolly might have been slightly type cast but definately had some big parts in this movie.  All of us will always remember the theme song playing in our heads.  Lily was perfect as the dedicated but passed over office worker.  Dabney Coleman absolutely wonderful as the jerk of a boss who got what he had coming to him.

It is a fun movie, specially for  Dolly Parton's song fans (even better when performed by herself).

Great acting, scripts, pacing, and chemistry from this cast. I watched this and ""Tootsie"" in the same week, and it reminded me why 80's movies are so sweet and cute- also that most of what was going on went completely over my head at the time, being a little kid.

As the women get together, they discuss their favorite fantasies concerning the boss, all of them concern offing him in one way or another. Jane bags him in a big game hunt, Dolly wants to rope and brand him and Lili has a Snow White fairytale scenario that has her as a princess surrounded by cute woodland animals bringing a cup of poison.

He doesn't drink it, but his chair gives way and he hit his head and was hospital bound. None of the three realized that he wasn't poisoned so they drive to the hospital to snatch the body, thinking it is their boss. When they find that it isn't they put it back and believe their troubles are behind them, only to discover that the boss learned about what happened and is planning to use that information to his own nefarious ends before he finally has them jailed. to prevent it, they take him captive at gunpoint while they try to figure a way to keep him quiet.

 An all star cast that did not disappoint and a story that is not only funny but redeeming too.

Lily Tomlin and Dabney Coleman in particular really shone in this movie. I also enjoyed Dolly Parton's performance but thought that Jane Fonda was the wrong actor for the part that she played. She just didn't 'ring true' as the shy, ditsy and ditched housewife, returning to the workforce in the office from hell. I could picture someone like Mia Farrow in this part but Jane Fonda suits roles of strong, confident women, so much better.

There is a cartoon sequence with Lily Tomlin that I remember fondly. It is similar to any children's show. Kids do not understand the adult themes until they are adults.

281185,4,6300247236,"Last night I felt like watching a comedy, so I put a ""9 to5"" DVD on. It starred Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. The setting was about 1980 when the country was going through a major realignment of the work force. The male-dominated upper levels of business, scientific or academic employment were under fire for not hiring and promoting enough women and women's role in these establishments was starkly defined. It was an interesting time and this movie fits the situation. All the stereotypes prevail in abundance. The Fonda/Tomlin/Parton trio play the downtrodden women and do an excellent job of it. Gags are plentiful and it makes it fun to look back on that period, if somewhat embarrassing.

The movie is well done. The acting is good, if somewhat exaggerated here and there for the purpose of laughs. The direction and filming are good. The three leading actresses fit well together and seem to be having a good time. It's a fun movie to watch. If I had any criticism, it would be that the circumstances have changed so drastically in the past three decades that the humor now seems very dated and somewhat stale. Well, that's the fate of producing a timely movie in a time of rapid change.

281233,4,6300247236,"Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Jane Fonda star as three overworked and underpaid secretaries who turn the tables on their chauvanist, unscrupulous boss Mr. Hart (Dabney Coleman) in this classic 1980 office comedy, crisply scripted and directed by the late Colin Higgins from a story by Patricia Resnick.
  Executive producer and top-billed star Jane Fonda  gives herself the least interesting of the three main roles. Fonda plays Judy Bernly, a rather mousy, nondescript woman who is re-entering the workplace after a recent divorce. By contrast, Violet Newstead  (Lily Tomlin) has been with Consolidated Corporation for twelve years and is constantly being passed over for promotion due to male-chauvanist prejudices. Friendly Doralee (Dolly Parton) has to endure harassment from Mr. Hart on a daily basis. The three eventually bond and fantasize about bumping off their boss. Tomlin's fantasy, based on  Walt Disney's ""Snow White,"" is especially inspired. The plot turns wildly wacky when Violet mistakenly thinks she has killed Hart, by putting rat poison into his coffee. This leads to an extended car chase/comedy sequence involving a dead body stolen from the hospital. Tomlin's comic hysteria is priceless. ""I murdered the boss,"" she wails, ""Do you think they're not going to throw me in prison for something like that?"" Mr. Hart does intend to throw the three ladies in prison for attempted murder; forcing them to, literally, tie Hart up and take charge of the office.
  Dabney Coleman is wonderful as Mr. Hart. Given the wacky turns of the plot, Hart could have easily come across as a cartoonish scoundral. Hart is a hateful boss, certainly. But as played by Coleman, he is a boss the audience loves to hate. Elizabeth Wilson has a memorable supporting role as Roz, who is secretly in love with Hart and functions as his ""snitch.""
  The film truly belongs to Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton. I can't praise Lily Tomlin's comedy skills highly enough. And Dolly Parton (in her film debut) has a natural, relaxed camera presence. She probably played Doralee as an extention of her own charming personality. But it is a shame that Parton's subsequent movie roles were never as good, or as fun,  as ""9 To 5."" Parton also wrote and performed the film's irresistably catchy and Academy Award nominated title song.

281238,5,6300247236,"I want to raise a glass to 9 to 5, a movie I didn't love love love when it first came out, 30 years ago, but now it looks brilliant.  And despite all the changes in the world, the world of work is still just as grim as the movie suggests.  How well the three stars interact!  Many have commented on how Jane Fonda, the movie's producer and the biggest star present, seems to enjoy playing a dowdy-type nebbish and taking a backseat to the bigger personalities of Tomlin and Parton, but she has got some wonderful scenes on her own.  Just to contrast, there's the pathetic scene when she comes home from her first horrible day at work and finds her husband at the apartment door. It's all in her face, the momentary hope that he's back, and then the disillusionment when instead he hands her the divorce papers, while his new girlfriend sits out front by the curb in his sportscar.  Her absurd little corsage doesn't wilt, but her spirit does, though she tries to keep her cool.

Joan Fontaine in Letter to an Unknown Woman didn't do that kind of acting any better than Fonda here.  But Jane also shines in the all-out Lucy Ricardo comedy when the monstrous Xerox machine goes out of control, spitting all colors of paper out at her and all she can do is keep shuffling them and trying to match their corners.  In fact it's a scene worthy of Chaplin.  Lily Tomlin has the fiery part, but her best scenes are at home, accepting a joint from her teenage son while she fixes the garage door opener on a stepladder.  Ditto with Dolly complaining to her husband that the other girls treat her like she's trash, and she doesn't know why.  ""It's because you're so pretty,"" he tells her, and she protests, but she likes to hear that, doesn't she?  I guess I like the movie because of its incisive picture of office life, and because of the spirit that its leading players (and even its supporting actors, like, is that Marian Mercer as Hart's wife?) give to the show.  It's a comedy, so the first half is better than the second half, but it's got the right stuff a;; the way through.",1283731200,,2074,4.397905759162303

The film is full of one line crack jokes which can be missed on the first time you watch it.

281298,5,6300247236,"""9 to 5"" became the third highest grossing film of 1981 and propelled Dolly Parton to movie star status. Not only was it her first movie, but many ardent Dolly fans have said it was her best work on film. The film garnered Miss Parton an Oscar nomination as Best Original Song, as well as two Grammys.
 Jane Fonda wanted to do a film about female office workers who get back at their egotistical and arrogant boss. Patricia Resnick, who also wrote Dolly's film ""Straight Talk"", penned the ""9 to 5"" script. It was through Jane's production company that ""9 to 5"" was produced. Jane knew she wanted both Lily Tomlin and Dolly for the roles of the other two secretaries that she would be playing alongside, and the result was one of the best trios ever in movie making. Their chemistry is right on, and as a result ""9 to 5"" has gone on to be a Hollywood classic. The script by Resnick is near perfect, and the supoorting roles, most notably Dabney Coleman who plays the boss Mr. Hartt, is superb. Sit back and enjoy a true funny and hilarious movie that has never aged, despite being made in 1980.
 Dolly is also producing a Broadway production called ""9 to 5 -The Musical"", in which she wrote the entire score, and the script has been written by Patricia Resnick. The musical opens on April 30, 2009.
 The DVD release features commentary with all the female stars-Parton, Fonda, and Tomlin, and its great hearing them talk about the making of ""9 to 5"".

I was shocked to find it is only in stereo. What the ....??? When you re-release a film on dvd you should better the sound and picture, not worsen it. What a ridiculous blunder by Fox. The extras are just ok and really only worth watching or listening to once, and the karaoke version of the title song's timing is way off. If you have the previous release, aren't all that interested in special features, and want the film presented the best possible way, stick with that version, or try to buy it from sellers on Amazon.

281301,3,6300247236,"From the moment I heard Dolly Parton's uniquely engaging voice come over my television stereo set singing the theme song to this 80's comedy I knew that I was going to enjoy myself.  I don't know what it is about that woman that I just adore, but whatever, that's neither here nor there.  The fact is that before I even got into the meat of this movie I had made my mind up.  By the time the credits began to roll I have changed my mind completely.  Yet still, by the time I woke up the next morning I had a very different outlook.

Okay, so here's the thing; `9 to 5' is a deceitful little thing.

This is what I mean.  `9 to 5' is not a laugh out loud type of comedy.  Maybe it is to some, but for me it was one of those `laugh quietly on the inside' type of comedies, and so because of that when the film ends I wound up thinking it wasn't really all that funny.  But it's also one of those comedies that sits well with you.  As you think about it you wind up finding the humor and before long you remember it funnier than when you were watching it.

Make sense?

So the film revolves around three working women and their egotistical boss.  Violet Newstead is a hard working woman seeking out a promotion that she wholeheartedly deserves; Doralee Rhodes is a hard working secretary just trying to do her job right despite the nasty rumors floating around the office, and Judy Bernly is a recent divorcee who just wants to prove her independence.  The problem they all share is the man they call boss; Franklin M. Hart Jr.

When an accident gives sends one of the girls into a panic their lives are forever changed as they find themselves holding their boss hostage, getting involved in blackmail and eventually teaching the man a thing or two about girl-power.

As far as the acting is concerned, there are clear standouts and a few disappointing letdowns.  First of all, Dolly Parton is a doll and a comedic knockout; truly the most inspired performance between the three leads.  Jane Fonda, an actress I am not usually smitten with, is less inspired but she manages to be better than I would have given her credit for.  My biggest disappointment came in the form of Lily Tomlin, who I just expected to be amazing.  I usually find her a comedic delight and a true standout in just about everything, but here she was at times rather dull.

The truth of the matter is though, that as much as this film is about these three women and their `standing up to the man', it is the man himself that runs away with the entire show.  Yes, Dabney Coleman, AKA Franklin M. Hart Jr. is seriously the funniest and most engaging part of this film.  He nails his character and delivers one of my favorite supporting performances of the said year.

So, the film is not as good as I expected (it can feel a little bland at times) but if you let it rest a bit it winds up being funnier the more you think about it.  In parts it's great and so maybe that's why it's funnier to think about than to watch, since when you think about it you think about the better parts.  Anyways, it's worthy watching at least once; if only for the great Coleman and the vivacious Parton.",1235433600,2,3152,4.30899830220713

281340,5,6300247236,"Even though the office equipment used in this movie has gone out of style, the comedy still packs a punch! This special edition DVD also has some nice extras celebrating the most famous office comedy of the bunch. What a combo! Fonda, Tomlin, and Parton...who could have ever imagined that one (watch the DVD and you'll see how Fonda herself came up with the casting one enchanted evening).

When this movie was made (1980), the office secretary had no respect. As Fonda points out in the DVD's featurette, the best way to address serious issues and get them out to a large audience is through comedy. This one succeeds on all levels. Judy (Fonda) has just been dumped by her husband...for his secretary. To pay the bills, she takes a job as (what else?) a secretary at the Consolidated Corporation. No-nonsense office manager Violet (Tomlin) trains Judy and passes on some of her frustration at always getting ""leap-frogged"" over for promotions by the good-ol'-boys network, headed by her sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical boss, Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman). Hart's personal secretary, Doralee (Parton), has made no friends in the steno pool because Hart has let it ""leak"" that the two are having an affair; the rest of the girls shun her for this.

When Violet accidentally pours rat poison into her boss' coffee instead of Skinny & Sweet, the antics begin and the office will never be the same as all 3 girls band together to make some changes.

Casting is amazing; Coleman is letter perfect as the slime-ball boss. Parton hits a home-run in her first movie as the heart-of-gold southern secretary who doesn't stand for bull-s&*t. Tomlin is excellent as Violet, especially in a fantasy sequence as a surreal Snow-White. Fonda is totally believeable as the clumsy defenseless woman dumped by a husband who is forced to fend for herself.

Extras include: commentary track with all Fonda, Tomlin, & Parton. Fonda is a little overbearing and is actually told to shut-up at one point. However, much of the excitement is due to how proud all three feel about this film, and how much fun they had making it. Not a lot of behind-the-scenes info, but just hearing the 3 together again is tons of fun. The featurette on the making-of again has all 3 reminiscing about the making of the movie, and includes flubs as well as how the movie came to be. A featurette on Writer/Director Colin Higgins is touching (Higgins has passed away), and all three leads agree on one thing: what a comically gifted and sweet man he was. It is obvious that much of ""9 to 5""'s success is due to him. They all credit him for his humor and timing and belief in the project. A few deleted scenes, a gag reel (some of the footage also appears in the documentaries), theatrical trailer, and a karaoke version of the hit title tune round out this excellent DVD.

DEFINITELY one for your comedy collection!",1217808000,6,2882,4.767535070140281
281341,5,6300247236,"A few years ago I went to the 25th Anniversary screening of one of my all time favorite movies 9 To 5. It was held at the Egyptian Theater and it was loaded with a bunch of gay boys and gals reciting lines! It was one of the most surreal movie experiences I've encountered. When I was but a wee boy, Cinemax ran 9 To 5 nonstop and I swear I must've watched the movie every single time it aired.

Classic lines and scenarios abound in this rather topical comedy -

""I'm a murderer""
""No, you're not.""
""I'm a murderess.""

""They're going to fire me for this.""
""Don't get hysterical Violet.""
""I'm no fool, I killed the boss you think they're not going to fire me for a thing like that?""

""I've got a gun out there in my purse and up to this time I've been forgiving and forgetting, but I""ll get that gun and turn you from a rooster to a hen in one shot!""

And the road rage as the three travel down the dark LA streets with a corpse in the trunk of their big blue Buick! Oh, classic stuff!

At the time of the theatrical presentation, they showed bloopers and gag reels, a retrospective on director/writer Collin Higgins and had one of the co-writers present to talk about. One question that was brought up was whether Fox would make a new DVD version to celebrate the 25th anniversary. The writer, Patricia Resnick thought Fox wasn't even aware it was the 25th anniversary of the film, but lo and behold we get the Sexist, Egotistical, Lying, Hypocritical Bigot Version has been released!

I ran out to Tower the minute it came out so I could get my hands on my own copy. As I walked into Tower on Sunset Boulevard, those boys were playing the movie and reciting every line! It was once again a very surreal moment. Imagine a group of rather punk rock looking boys reciting feminist lines by the likes of Dolly Parton & Lily Tomlin - I love this place!

So now I tell you - run out and buy your own copy! The DVD contains commentary by all three of the leading ladies, and the co-producer. Plus the retrospective I talked about, some bloopers and a karoke version of ""9 To 5"" so we can all sing along to the theme song!

281405,5,6300247236,This film was so funny when I first saw over 20 years ago and it still has its magic 20 years on.  The three main actress were perfect for each of their roles and this was Dolly Parton's first film but she never showed it she seemed as though she had been doing it for a long time.  Jane Fonda did a wonderful job at being the new girl in the office and durring the film she became strong and confident and Lily Tomlin was perfect as the overlooked worker and taken for granted.

281454,5,6300247236,"FIRST THOUGHTS - -

This movie is among the greatest 100 minute entertainment fests in existence. ""9 to 5"" reaches and touches everybody, both male and female somewhere personal and strangely satisfying. Though the plot is great and really moves, it is the smart ""fantasy-revenge"" ideas, dialogue and strong characterizations that keep this from becoming mean-spirited and thereby enable this movie to work so well for a diverse audience.

We need to salute Director/Screenwriter, Colin Higgins first. Higgins was the Screenwriter for ""Harold and Maude"", ""Silver Streak"" and ""Foul Play"", picking up a Golden Globe nomination for ""Foul Play"" in 1978. All of Higgins films have an air of sophistication and display a refreshing respect for the audience particularly in avoiding the obvious mean-spirited cliches that many of his films' topics' encompass. Also, Editor Pembroke J. Herring who was nominated for 3 Academy Awards for Editing and also edited ""Ground Hogs Day"", did an amazingly seamless job of keeping ""9 to 5"" so coherently glued together. Herring was nominated for ""Best Editing"" for; ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", 1970, ""Bound For Glory"",1976, ""Out Of Africa"", 1985 and edited many other excellent comedies and dramas. Higgins and Herring worked together on a number films all of which turned out the better for their contribution and ""9 to 5"" is one of them.

The three female leads all embody some type of stereotype. Lily Tomlin, as Violet Newstead is the widow with four children, going it alone and trying to break into the male dominated executive world of big business for the past 12 years - UNSUCCESSFULLY. She is confident and capable but she is a woman in a man's world, so she is very dissatisfied with the treatment she has been getting by the male establishment embodied through F. Hart [Dabney Coleman]. Jane Fonda, as Judy Bernly, is in the middle of a divorce in which her no-good husband, Dick, played deftly by Lawrence Pressman, left her for his secretary. Judy is now entering the workforce unprepared and for the first time and especially unprepared for the living embodiment himself, F.Hart. Dolly Parton as the delightful Doralee Rhodes, who F.hart chases round and round the office and even tries getting to conventions that do not exist all for a good time - HIS, examplifies how office rumors can ruin peoples' reputations and of course by the living embodiment himself. That's F.Hart of course and he is the bane of these three ""innocent women"" and as we see, represents most everything that is wrong in their lives as they see it. BTW, Dolly Parton in this role was nominated for an ""Oscar"", ""Best Song"", and 3 ""Golden Globes"", includeing ""Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy"".

This film could not get off the ground without a worthy adversary to these very potent femme fatales in training. Dabney Coleman as Franklin Hart or just F.HART, delivers an oscar worthy effort in his role as the living embodiment of almost every rotten thing a man in charge can do to women under him at the office. He is ""his"" 3 ""GIRLS"" reason for being the way they are, at least throughout the film. Coleman very generously lends himself to the same type of role Carrol O'Connor did in ""All In The Family"" as a means of illustrating that some things are clearly and obviously wrong and need to be changed. Comedy and Cliches are powerful tools for evoking awareness and change and ""9 to 5"" serves that cause well, chiefly through the utterly despicable nature of Coleman's character. Man or woman, we all enjoy Coleman's comeupance and so will you.

My favorite scenes are the three completely different fantasies our heroines relay to each other while under the influence of marijuana. Naturally, these flights of fancy all involved some overdue and elaborate revenge against F.Hart. Even such animated Disney characters as ""Snow White"" make an appearance in Tomlin's depiction of Hart's demise. Naturally, the reality nearly repeats Tomlin's fantasy on the very next day, which leads our heroines to stealing a corpse, evading the police, kidnapping and much, much more.

The scenes and gags in this film all further the plot and just dove-tail so nicely and so entertainingly together that it is over all to soon. We are left wanting more without realizing we have just sat for over 100 minutes and the issues and conflicts motivating the characters and fueling the film's plot have been resolved.

This is a terrific black comedy. Our characters [3 female leads] gain our empathy as they enter into a kind of twilight zone where both their personal survival and convictions stretch these women and allow their characters to show what they are made of and achieve both personal growth and unexpected satisfaction. Their foil, F.HART after showing all how despicable he was, literally plunges into the abyss as if sent to purgatory and then hell for his misdeeds against women as the plot unfolds. ""REEL JUSTICE"", tidy and quick!! The topic and the settings have aged very well and even after a quarter century this film in no way seems dated.

DVD FEATURES:

It is widescreen [1.85:1] and much clearer than the VHS release. The Disney characters in Violet's fantasy demonstrate this obvious color and clarity improvement over the video release. It has 1 trailer and of course scene selection and is available on the same DVD in either English or French with English or Spanish subtitles or no subtitles at all [of course]. Naturally, some interviews and a neat featurette would be nice but again this is a large improvement over the old faded video releases.

FINAL THOUGHTS - - This wonderful film is highly recommended and ""9 to 5s"" entertainment value stands up very well to repeated viewings and the passage of 26 years.",1150416000,38,6340,4.911654135338346
281455,4,6300247236,"This review is for the 2001 DVD release.
  Have you ever daydreamed about what you would like to do to your boss who was too [..] you or did something to you objectionable?
  Well, these secretaries did.  They carried out a plan against their boss and got away with it.
  Please keep in mind, this film is a comedy and was made to laugh at.
  However, their are some strong messages here that can be well learned.  Bosses should not verbally abuse and/or sexually intent, touch, harass any employee.  This film does point out employees have rights too.  Managers can be in the wrong too.
 Jane Fonda is ""Judy Bernly"".  Recently divorced.  Has no experience, but is a very decent woman.  Today is her first day at Consolidated Companies LTD.  On her first day everything goes wrong.
  Lily Tomlin is ""Violet Newstead"".  She has worked their forever.  Never spies.  She is ready for a promotion. She trains Judy on her first day.  In fact, Violet has trained most of the people there and they have been promoted instead of her.
  Dolly Parton (in her first film) is ""Doralee Rhodes"".  Mr. Hart's main secretary.  There is bad gossip going around about the boss and the secretary, but it is not true.  Doralee is a married woman  and is a Christian and pure as Judy is and would never engage in bad behavior at work.
  Dabney Coleman is the boss, ""Franklin Hart"". He is the boss and the vice-president.  Has has a bad mouth towards secretaries and wants ""personal servitude"" that is not part of the job description.
  After the boss makes personal advances towards Doralee, makes inappropriate comments towards Violet and dismisses Maria (Roxanna Bonilla-Giannini) for having light conversation in the bathroom and guessing the bosses salary, and after another incident, Violet, along with Doralee and Judy later decide that something has to be done to the boss and improvements must be made within the company.
  Better working conditions for all.  Violet just might get her promotion yet.
Also in the cast: Elizabeth Wilson, Peggy Pope, Sterling Hayden, Lawrence Pressman, Marian Mercer.
  Yes, that is Dolly Parton singing ""Nine To Five"".

 Jane Fonda and Dabney Coleman also worked together in On Golden Pond (1981).

  Followed by the tv series Nine To Five (1982-83) with Rachel Dennison as ""Doralee"" (Yes, Rachel is Dolly Parton's real-life sister), Valerie Curtin as ""Judy"", Sally Struthers as ""Marsha"" and Rita Moreno as ""Violet"".  Jane Fonda was one of the executive producers / producers.

Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda star in, Grace and Frankie online series (Netflix, 2015-18).

Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton were reunited on the 23rd Screen Actors Guild Awards 2017.
Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda reunited on the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards 2017.

Update:  Nine to Five..Too, a sequel has been long-awaited and long-rumored, but no absolute plans yet.
  Dolly Parton joked on The Today Show, October 16, 2017, if they don't get to it now, they might have to title it, ""95"".",1149292800,4,2991,4.870259481037924
281456,5,6300247236,"9 to 5 was the first film to address the glass ceiling.  It takes a look at the workplace from a woman's view.

We first meet Violet (Lily Tomlin) who has been working for Consolidated Companies for 12 years and has been overlooked for most of them.  She trained her current boss and has the bruises to prove it.  Judy (Jane Fonda) is the new girl in the office.  She is a divorcee (he left her for his secretary) and has never worked for a living.  Rounding out the heroines is Doralee (Dolly Parton in the film debut). She is the personal secretary of Franklin Hart (Dabney Coleman) and everyone thinks she is ""banging the boss"".

But the fun starts when Violet is passed over for a promotion to a man she helped train.  She then blurts out that Hart has been spreading rumors that he's been having an affair with Doralee.  And an employee is fired for a small infraction. This sends the three women to the local bar to drown their sorrows and they bond.

Each comes up with their fantasy way of killing the boss.  Judy is a big game hunter with Hart as the prey.  Doralee plays role reversal and Hart ends up on a rotisserie spit.  But Violet wants it to be like a fairy tale where she is Snow White and the wicked witch and poisons Hart.

The next day, Violet accidentally poisons Hart's coffee.  When falls out of his chair and is knock unconscious, Violet thinks she killed him.  This leads to an all out comedy chase with Violet steals the wrong corpse.

The next day to the ladies surprise, Hart shows up.  The ladies regroup in the restroom but Roz overhears them and reports it to Hart.  Hart confronts the ladies but they wind up kidnapping him to find some incriminating evidence.  The find something but it is going to take some time to get the evidence.  Over the next six weeks the ladies run the office in Hart's absence.  Hart escapes but the ladies changes have brought notice and Hart is not above taking someone else's glory.

The subject matter here is very serious.  So to do it as a comedy is very daring and it works perfectly.  This is a film that many people identify with.  Everyone has had a boss or a teacher that oppressed them.  And this film is what we all would like to do to these oppressors.  You will laugh until it hurts.

DVD EXTRAS:

Commentary by producer Bruce Gilbert and stars Lily, Jane and Dolly

9 to 5 @ 25 - a 25 minute featurette with interviews with Gilbert, writer director Colin Higgins and stars Lily. Jane, Dolly and Dabney Coleman.

Deleted Scenes - 10 mostly expanded scenes or alternate takes.  The problem is without some kind of commentary we do not know why the scene was cut.",1146787200,,2636,4.391304347826087

281514,5,6300247236,"I'm so glad that Fox has re-released this great movie.  It is an all-time classic.  I am confining my review to the extras on this new release as most people have seen and know what this movie is about. Yes, the movie itself stands on it's on as deserving a dvd release BUT it is SOO wonderful that they have put out all these great extras on the new release!  It is wonderful to see Jane,Lily & Dolly interviewed about the making of this film, as well as all of the deleted scenes, the hysterical gag reel and of course the commentary.  I would recommend watching the movie with the commentary on as it is the best way to learn what the trio have to say about the movie, their costars and themselves and all of the behind-the-scenes ""dish"".  Although if you're looking for backstabbing divas you will be disappointed as they have nothing but fun, positive memories to share about making this film.  They do still talk about a sequel which is almost hard to believe that they could do because it would be hard to top this movie.  A nice piece that is included is about Colin Higgins, the writer/director of the film.  They obviously adored and had great respect for this man.  It was nice to see him get some recognition, even if he has passed.

By the way, from looking at the recent reunion pictures for this special release, don't they all 3 still look great?

Buy this movie for the laughs and the spectacular special features.",1145232000,4,1431,4.444444444444445
281515,5,6300247236,"I was but 9-years-old when this one came to theatres and I still remember how at that time, the movie theater held such a spell of mystique over me...something that gets lost as you get older and movies are more ""every day"" now.

As most might attest, the film starts off wonderfully with the opening, upbeat, thumping chords of the theme song, ""9 to 5"" sung by the incomparable Dolly Parton...the song invigorates you right from the start and you know you are in for a load of fun.

Lily Tomlin, Dolly Parton, and Jane Fonda are cast perfectly and beautifully in their respective roles. I don't know of any modern actress/comedians who could fill these roles more beautifully. Quite simply, Lily Tomlin is a comedic genius...and she is fully supported by the lesser experienced Dolly and far more experienced Jane Fonda. Surprisingly, Jane Fonda, already somewhat of an icon at the time, took a less visible/memorable role...but played it with perfectly subtelty and professionalism.

A few of my favorite scenes: The three girls are pulled over by the cop because of the ""short"" in the trunk. They know the body is in the trunk, but are trying to play it off by pretending that Dolly's character ate rat poison by accident.

Also, for years later, I was afraid to go into hospital bathrooms after the female orderly found the ""body"" in the bathroom covered by the sheet...by the way she said, ""There's another stiff in the john""...I assumed that dead bodies were often found in hospital bathrooms.

Dabney Coleman played the perfect sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot boss...and as a kid, I truly hated him.

Another of my favorite bits was when Lily Tomlin, in her Disney-like dream sequence, poisons her bosses coffee...then launches him out of his office window right after saying, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"" then sticking out her tongue. For years, my siblings and I would tease each other with the same gesture. (you'll have to watch the film to know what I'm talking about).

If you watch this film for the first time, you'll notice there are no desktop computers...nor does anyone have a cell phone. And the copy machine is almost the size of a small car. It may date the film just a tad...but the comedic value more than makes up for that. It's definitely a film for all time and women today, I'm sure, are still facing similar type situations in the office.

Now in my 30's, I'm always surprised at the number of 20-something's who have never seen nor heard of this classic film. Wow...we're calling 1980's movies ""classics"" now. Yikes. Are we getting old?",1144886400,,2573,4.81859410430839
281516,5,6300247236,"This movie is the perfect revenge movie.  Plus, it might just be me, but I always thought that Dolly looked better with a little more weight on her.  And ""Wow"" Dolly.  For a first time acting gig, she proved to be a natural with such greats as Lily and Jane (political controversy aside).  I think every woman could identify with at least one of the women--for me it was Lily's character.  But watching this movie so many years later, I'm struck by the cliche line 'the more things change the more they stay the same'.",1144800000,,518,4.410526315789474
281517,5,6300247236,"9 To 5 is a classic 80's comedy directed by Colin Higgins, the man behind such classics as Silver Streak and Harold And Maude, and starring Jane Fonda (Coming Home), Lilly Tomlin (Short Cuts), Dolly Parton (Rhinestone), and Dabney Coleman (You've Got Mail).

Fonda, Tomlin and Parton play three co-workers at a company managed by a skirt chasing male chauvinist boss, played by Coleman. The three ladies fantasize about how they can take revenge against him, that includes hunting him down like a deer in the office and one involving Snow White and the 7 dwarfs.

Panic strikes the girls when Tomlin accidentally puts rat poison in his coffee and minutes later he's carried away to the hospital. The movie gets funnier and funnier as the events unfold from here on.

9 To 5 was a huge box office success when it was released in 1980. The movie featured country singer Dolly Parton in her first acting role, as well as the Oscar nominated and 80's classic hit song 9 to 5 performed by Parton herself.

281518,5,6300247236,"I've had the regular release DVD for a few years and never tire or watching it.  The movie is great Friday night entertainment when you're staying in.  This is also a movie that you can watch with your children and not have to worry about language or sex.

The cast is wonderful with Fonda, Tomlin, Parton, Coleman.  I could never imagine a remake of this movie with four other actors that would be as funny or as effective.

The premise is pretty simple.  The movie examines the status of women in the workplace in the late 70's/early 80's.  When the boss is almost accidently poisoned, the three women assume that Tomlin killed him.  But he isn't dead. This sets up a series of hilarious situations that have to be seen to be appreciated.

As a teacher of business related topics at the college level I find this movie to be a wonderful time capsule of the treatment of women in the workplace in previous decades.  I have actually shown this film to my classes in Principles of Management and asked students to spot the injustices.  Corporate America used to be this way.

The Sexist, Egotistical, Lying Hypocritical Bigot (SELHB) edition is filled with out-takes, commentaries that make the movie even more interesting.  I especially like the commentaries.

The ladies are all great and I just watched this new DVD copy last night and it still stand the test of time.

That being said (the movie gets 5 stars)

The dvd was just so-so.

First off, I was shocked that they didn't even bother to make the soundtrack in 5.1 digital audio!!!  What!?!

I haven't bought a DVD in a long time that was just in stereo.

I was looking forward to hearing Dolly in 5.1 surround sound sing 9 to 5.  :(

The film transfer was also dissapoiting.  It looks like they didn't even bother to restore the film, they just cleaned it up a bit and threw it on the computer to be digitized.

The special features are also very lacking.  The commentary with the ladies is great, the featurette is good but that's pretty much it.

There's a few other things, but come on.  It's 25 years old and you just throw the DVD together?  Very lazy.

Overall still a great movie that shows the struggles women had to put up with in the early 80's and how far things have come and haven't come these days.

I NEVER ever get tired of this movie.  Everytime I see it on cable I have to stop and watch it I can recite it line by line I've seen it so many times.  I bought the barebones DVD that came out several years ago and of course I HAD to have this one.  This movie will never grow old. It's a CLASSIC,1144022400,4,459,3.7604166666666665
281575,5,6300247236,"This film is one of the rare achievements in comedy: I can watch this over and over (and I have) and still laugh at the same parts. The jokes never wear out after a viewing or two. That's due in part to the excellent camaraderie between Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin, and Dolly Parton. I simply can't imagine this film without any of those three, for they made their roles what it is and the interractions between the three of them are hilarious. Dabney Coleman as their sexist boss with an extremely naive wife is also hilarious as he gets his comeuppance.

Jane Fonda plays a mousy lady who enters the work force after her husband runs off with his secretary. Seeing her flustered by the photocopier is hilarious and it's fun to watch her transformation into a confident lady who can hold her own (gun) against the boss.

Lily Tomlin plays the lady who's been at the company for a long time and is passed over for a rightful promotion because she's a woman. I love her scene when she schemes to steal a body from the hospital, mistakingly thinking it's her boss's dead body. When she's in a doctor's white coat and a candy striper stops her and apologizes when she realizes she's interrupting a doctor, Lily says, ""that's right, I'm a doctor...so why the hell am I talking to you?""

Dolly Parton plays the secretary who uses her God-given endowment to humorous effect. Dabney Coleman can't help to push pencil holders off his desk so she can bend down and pick them up while he gets to sneak a peak. It was this film that has made me a lifelong fan of Dolly Parton because I love how she rebukes her boss by telling him that she put up with his behavior because of the way she was brought up and won't tolerate it anymore and if he messes with her, she'll gladly turn him ""from a rooster to a hen in one shot!"" I especially loves how she tells him, ""I never thought I'd live to say this about another human being, but you are evil, that's right, EVIL TO THE CORE!"" Yow! She means business, but it only makes the boss more turned on, so she has to back her words with deeds, thus fulfilling her fantasy sequence.

The dream sequences are hilarious and it is interesting to see the way they each come true. I love Lily Tomlin's Disney-esque dream sequence, the one that causes the most problems. While the movie does veer off in a surprising way, and some might say outlandishly unrealistic, and while one reviewer mentioned that it doesn't end with a ""big bang"", I think the ending was delightfully ironic. The ladies improved the office environment, no one missed the boss, someone even higher up noticed the improvements and justice prevailed. Beautiful!

I was only a kid when I saw this film in theaters and it has been one of few films where the humor never gets old. Anytime I need a laugh, I can rely on this film to provide them despite the numerous times I've seen it. That's a credit to everyone involved in making this film, but most especially to the three actresses who really play well off each other with comedic brilliance! I'm glad they have released a special edition, as I waited to buy it on DVD for just such an edition. Now the long wait is over.",1142640000,91,3163,4.427835051546392

I loved this story because it combined fantasy/cartoon sequences with great slapstick and engaging actors.  When three intelligent, fed-up 9 to 5 white collar workers (Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton) decide to team up against their boss, chaos and laughs follow in droves!

Nine to Five is a timeless story that takes a look at office politics and the struggle for the modern woman to overcome office oppression and daily injustices in the workplace. When Lily Tomlin's character accidently puts rat poisoning in their superior's coffee, this sets off a whole chain of events.  You just have to see it.

This movie tells the story of three clerical workers in corporate America who have to endure a sexist boss (played perfectly by Dabney Coleman). Each of the main characters fantasize about getting their sweet revenge with their boss. And one day, due to a freak accident (caused by Violet) they actually live out their fantasy! Mr. Heart (the boss) hears of how he was ""poisoned"" from his 2-faced cohort Roz (played by Elizabeth Wilson) who was only too happy to repeat the gossip that she overheard. By the way, doesn't everyone have a coworker like Roz?? The movie then takes on a twist of black comedy and poetic justice when Judy, Violet & Doralee decide to tie up Mr. Hart and hold him prisoner while they find enough dirt on him so they can blackmail him. It's then a race for time for the ladies to keep Hart tied up and out of sight. Fortunately, Mr. Hart's wife is on a cruise but Roz is still lurking about. After the ladies concoct a scheme to send Roz away for a few weeks their true magic really starts to happen! They enact several policies that were groundbreaking for their time: an alcohol rehabilitation program, equal pay & a daycare center!

The company had never seen such growth and it was all due to Doralee, Judy & Violet. Unfortunately, Mr. Hart manages to finally break out of his ""prison"" and gets back to the office just in time to see the company's CEO who wants to congratulate. Of course Mr. Hart is more than happy to take ALL of the credit for ALL of the work that he did not do. The CEO decides to promote him! Mr. Hart was shipped out to Brazil without a second thought! Judy finally got her long overdue promotion & the rest live happily ever after!

The three women are hillarious and have exelent timing with delivering their lines, really bringing out the latent humor in the script.  Scenes like the hospital scene, the Xerox room, and the ending remain in your mind, and will cause your lips to roll up into a smile whenever you think about them.

281632,4,6300247236,"It is no secret that there are many managers in this world who are nothing more than tokenheads of their departments. The real movers, shakers, and go-getters are the underlings that work for the manager.
And so is the case of Franklin M Hart, Jr., (perfectly played by Dabney Colemna) a vice-president at Consolidated. Oh sure, he was nice enough as he worked his way to the top of this male-dominated firm. But once he got there, he started stepping on everyone below him, including Violet Newstead (the ever funny Lily Tomlin), the office manager. As if that wasn't bad enough, Mr. Hart continously tries to seduce his unavailable, and equally unwilling, secretary, Doralee Rhodes (Dolly Parton, making her movie debut). And when the new girl, Judy Bernly (Jane Fonda), accidentally makes a mess in the copier room, Mr. Hart tells her like it is.
After a while, the three put-upon women become friends, and after smoking a single joint together, start fantasizing about how they would put Mr. Hart in his place. Soon, however, fantasy becomes reality when Mr. Hart finds out that Violet accidentally put rat poison in his coffee.
In an attempt to stay out of jail, Violet, Doralee, and Judy take Mr. Hart hostage while they formulate a plan. Soon they discover that Mr. Hart has illegally made a profit at Consolidated's expense, and set out to get the evidence needed that will keep Mr. Hart from going to the police. But it will take nearly three weeks for the home office to send them the information. Will they be able to keep Mr. Hart under lock and key until then? Better yet, can they fool the office into thinking that Mr. Hart is still at work even though he's not?
""9 to 5"" is one of those movies that you can't help but to enjoy. Funny, witty, and smart, anyone who has ever worked for a manager that didn't deserve to be a manager will enjoy watching fantasy become reality (at least, in the movie).
Released in 1980, this movie earned over $100 million (a relative rarity back then). It also earned Dolly Parton an Oscar nomination (Best Music - Original Song), three Golden Globes nominations (Best Motion Picture Actress - Musical/Comedy; Best Original Song - Motion Picture; New Star of the Year in a Motion Picture - Female), and a Grammy nomination (Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special). She also won a People's Choice Award for Favorite Motion Picture Song.
The success of the movie resulted in two short-lived TV series (first one from 1982-1983; second one from 1986 - 1988), both of which starred Dolly Parton's sister, Rachel Dennison.
If you've ever dreamed of watching your manager get his or her just desserts, then this movie will provide you with plenty of laughs (and possibly an idea or two).",1085788800,7,2769,4.734989648033126

I thought it was hilarious then and I still think it is hilarious now. Dabney Coleman was the perfect evil boss. He was a sexist, bigoted jerk of a human being who treated his employees like dirt. Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, and Dolly Parton rounds out the cast as the disgruntled employees. Although we use computers now, office antics remains unchanged in the 21st century. Who hasn't dreamt of killing their boss? ""9 to 5"" really epitomized just how funny, if not torturous working in an office can be. I know from experience. Thankfully I never encountered a male supervisor who sexually harassed me like Dabney Coleman did to Dolly Parton in the movie. My personal favorite moment in the film was when the women were at Dolly's home kicking back on some wacky tobaccy. The fantasies were hysterical. They still crack me up to this very day. I personally loved Lily Tomlin's fantasy as Snow White.  The longer I work in an office environment, the more I can relate to films like ""9 to 5"" and ""Office Space"".

281638,5,6300247236,"I first saw this movie about seven years ago.  It was released in September, 1995, almost exactly eight years ago.  It was hilarious then, and still is.

The thrust of the story is the male chauvinist, ""old boy"" network
and how unfairly it treats the ""girls"" employed in the business.  The heavy is Dabney Coleman (portraying Franklin Hart, Jr., who has risen to be department head over the woman who trained him, Violet(beautifully played by Lily Tomlin.)

But the best performance was by Dolly Parton, who plays Doralee, his private secretary with whom Hart allows everyone to believe that he is having an affair.  When she finds out about it, she threaten to get her gun and ""change him from a rooster to a hen with one shot.""  One of the more hilarious lines in the movie, as she delivers it.

I watched this film again last night, and it was just as funny as it was the first time.

Certainly one of the best movies ever made around a feminist theme.  If only they'd left 'Hanoi Jane' out of it, I'd have liked it even better.

281680,3,6300247236,"When this movie first came out it was a movie that had lessons to be learned by an America ""that didn't get it"".  Learning a lesson from the TV show All In The Family, humor can be used to nudge people into accepting new ideas.  And this is a funny, enjoyable and entertaining movie.
What of the lessons.
The primary message is of female rights in the work place.  By watching this movie, you can see some of the common sense notions that once marked the feminist movement.  How come no big 8 accounting fim had female partners?  Good question.  How come out of 50 directors of aetna, all were male.  The conditions of equal pay and protection from sexual harrassment have vastly improved since this movie was made.
The second notion was more accomodating treatment of employees in the workplace.  Many employers are doing a better job now than when 9-5 first appeared.
The third notion that unfortuneately has permeated society also is the lessons that ""normal people can do drugs and be very productive members of society"".  Edit out the drug use scene and this movie is suitable for family viewing.  I am not sure why the writers felt the need to present illegal drug use as something that normal people do, but it defineately takes away from the movies higher messages.
For the comedy and the first 2 lessions of the movie I give 4 stars.  For showing maryjane use without negative consequence I give 2 stars for an average of 3.

Needless to say it doesn't any longer!:)All of the cast is excellent and the theme song is one of Dolly Parton's best. On a more serious note, what I find particularly valuable is its presentation of life in low-paid work. Many of the situations can be found in the working place today and the film handles them with the right mix of seriousness and humour. In fact, I use anecdotes from the movie when teaching my students about the Industrial Revolution (especially about Roz, ""the eyes, ears, nose and throat of the boss"".)
