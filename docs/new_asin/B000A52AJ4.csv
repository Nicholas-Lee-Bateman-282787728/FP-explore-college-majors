8074684,4,B000A52AJ4,"I loved Linda's first Discovering Chi workout which was set in a studio indoors w/students, easy to follow, fun to do & I always felt my energy increase & felt great healing.
This one is set outside with a beautiful landscape in a forest, but it is only a single camera & therefore hard to follow. What makes it harder is there are more turns involved, facing you, then facing away & facing to the side with different leg & arm positions & movements for each facing position.
She would try to make up for not being able to seen when she turns, by facing the camera again though when executed she would be facing the other way, but to put it together made it harder since you can't mirror her. Linda also cued HER left/right which makes it hard even if there were no turns involved. You think ""ok, I do this when facing the tv, but when I turn I do.. no wait, that's not working, I use my left, no my right..."" & you end up frustrated.
Though the outside is wonderful, for something that involves turns like the regular short yang style Tai Chi does, having the teacher's back face you, them facing a mirror so you can see their front & be able to copy them perfectly, your left is their left, etc. would make this SO much easier.
Also, she says to do the energy 15 minute warm-up before doing this, but this is not on this DVD. I think it was a cheap/bad decision not to include that warm-up on this DVD & you are forced to go by memory or drag out that DVD first & play it.
Another thing is this was originally a VHS done in 1995, it starts with her doing it for 25 minutes w/limited reminder pointers (for when you've mastered the instructional portion & don't want the slower/detailed instruction). The idea is once you've master the instructional portion, with FFwding & RWing you'd want the portion you'd play the most. Since there are no menu choices other then English/Mandarin language choices, or even bookmarks... you have to FFwd manually those 25 min to get to the detailed instructional portion.
There are no chapters like her first DVD when they changed it over which is real lazy of the production crew.

Linda Modaro personally responded 10/4/06 to the complaints on the Beginner DVDs on the 4 DVD disk set amazon page:
After reading some customers comments about the difficulty with the first run of the DVD, I called my distributor Terra Entertainment. Carlos Solorio assured me that they have reprogrammed the DVD to include a menu portion so that customers can easily navigate the material. Thank you for bringing this to my attention and if you would like a replacement copy of the DVD, please email me personally and I get you one. In additon, all DVD's have a language selection of English or Chinese. If your DVD does not give you a choice, please contact Terra Entertainment or the place you bought the product from to replace it. We will be adding Spanish and French, hopefully in the next year.
Sincerely,
Linda Modaro

8074685,4,B000A52AJ4,"This second DVD is shot in a pine forest. The exercises get more difficult so I had to practice the routine in the first DVD for over four months.

Unfortunately, it's difficult to see how to perform some of the new moves. So I'm kind of stuck in the first level and now and then I add a new move here and there. You need to sit down and watch those moves over and over and then try then until you get them. I hope it gets easier with practice.

One nice thing is that I learned that I can do my original routine a lot faster and I'm finally (after 5 months!!!) starting to feel the energy, specially in the heart chakra.

DVD should be a must because you're gonna need to go back and forth a lot. Don't bother with tapes. Good luck and good Chi.",1141430400,7,746,4.027027027027027
