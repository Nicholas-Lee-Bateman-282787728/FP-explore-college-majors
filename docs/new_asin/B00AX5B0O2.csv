5525385,1,B00AX5B0O2,"Season 5 is not your older brother's A Haunting. After a surprisingly subpar premiere, I examined the ""cast and crew"" of BLOOD VISIONS with that of a smoldering and delightfully nuanced Season 1 favorite, THE HAUNTING OF SUMMERWIND. The reason for the dropoff in quality quickly became apparent: a near total turnover in production staff. Season 5 is also operating with a skeleton crew compared to Season 1, with far less differentiated job functions in the areas of sound and visual effects. But before I get into the details, let me first regale you with my scathing indictment of BLOOD VISIONS.

I waited 4 years for new episodes, but last night's Season 5 premiere offended more of my sensibilities (i.e., artistic, intellectual) and left me with an aftertaste so foul, I needed the 1979 Salem's Lot to cleanse my palette. I would have thrown in an old episode of A Haunting, but it would have saddened me since I rewatched them all as a build up to the Sreason 5 premiere. I put a great deal of pressure on myself to like the premiere as did many of you -- I can tell. But unlike some of you who will not be honest with yourself or others -- I am not going to continue to wave my pom poms in some denial or inability to tolerate cognitive dissonance. I can celebrate the first 3 seasons (by the fourth season, the program was beginning to lose some of its luster), and yet cry in my cereal over this latest abomination. I would be embarrassed now to call myself a fan of this program. Judging from the tepid response on FACEBOOK/DESTINATION AMERICA, which features less than a handful of positive comments -- all of the 6-words-or-less variety -- despite a groundswell of anticipation and a countdown atmosphere, others feel the same. (This review you are reading was removed, so DESINATION AMERICA is not allowing any reviews that are not positive).

Where do I begin? What went wrong? The episode begins amusingly enough, with a shot of the soon-to-be-possessed Detroit pot-bellied teen in a motley wife-beater. I always did enjoy the quirkiness of this program and the way it captured the eccentrities of the haunting victims through character acting and interviews (see SUMMERWIND and FLORIDA). But THIS was just bad. Acting that doesn't belong on any size screen and excerpts from interviews that fell flat.

I'm still trying to determine which was more obvious and obnoxiously gratuitous -- the dialogue or the special effects. First, the dialogue. Now I understand why this program was moved to DESTINATION AMERICA. The characters all talked like tour guides, explaining to each other everything that was going on right in front of their eyes (and that we can plainly see at home). No one talks like this in real life. You get that, Michael Ray Brown? The script even managed to make the once smoldering Anthony Call sound like a high school drama student. And yet this lack of subtlety was somehow topped by the plainly visible hand of the computer in the CGI effects. Ghost stories is the one place where less is more in the CGI department. And yet from all appearances, BLOOD VISIONS was vying to overtake Star Wars. The black smoky ectoplasmic like substance on the ceiling -- rendered capably in the 2005 episode CURSED -- looks entirely digitized in BLOOD VISIONS. It's the CGI equivalent of seeing the strings holding up the planets in 1950s Flash Gordon films. I was embarrassed for everyone watching this thing try to pass for something real and substantive. Nothing -- I repeat -- NOTHING -- throws a wet towel over a creepy atmospheric vibe better than overly-wrought and exposed computer graphics. I didn't know whether to blame less skilled staff, less psychologically sophisticated minds, or the technology itself -- but last night's episode was less Industrial Light and Magic and more Atari. The reality of ghostly phenomenon is subtle and mysterious, and this should play into the hands of good film-making, which stirs our soul by leaving a little to the imagination. Not BLOOD VISIONS, where the demon actually enters the room of the girl ""investigator,"" and then runs from her as she chases it through her home hollering ""We are going to help that family!"" Pathetic.

And the cinematography and editing was nothing short of dizzying and had me wondering whether the entire crew needs to be treated for ADHD. All this -- the shortfalls in writing, editing, cinematography, and special effects -- amounts to poor storytelling. Seasons 1-4 met their burden -- the challenge of selling us on some rather unbelievable events. Season 5 might as well classify itself as fiction. When you can't tell a story well, the lack of wit and believability is all the more exposed. I did not question the credibility of Season 2 WHERE DEMONS DWELL in which Satan Himself crawls out in the flesh from a well behind a rental property in rural Connecticut, and yet I doubted everything depicted in BLOOD VISIONS right down to the 16-year-old Buffy who chased away the demon like one would take a broom to a raccoon in one's garage. If I learned nothing from seasons 1-4, smudging does not work and 16-year-old valley girls with no background in science or connection to the Church can chase demons away. Unless of course the prayer read off that single sheet of paper was actually the script for last night's episode, which could probably chase anything on Heaven and Earth.

This brings us to another problem. Season 5 is less disciplined than Season 1 and plays too loose with the facts. Perhaps the absence of an active research manager (i.e., Carol Bornman)is responsible. There were some rather fascinating aspects to the Summerwind Haunting that did not make its way into the episode. Rooms changing dimensions on contractors, Possessions of former residents appearing as double exposures in Hinshaw photographs. That corpse in the crawl space that Arnie sent April in to investigate. Then it occurred to me that perhaps to play it conservatively and let the implied aspects of the mystery do the talking, the SUMMERWIND crew decided only to include what those aspects of the haunting that seemed relatively more reliable (e.g., multiple eye witnesses, consistent accounts). But a number of things occur in BLOOD VISIONS for which the crew accepted on faith the account of a single person -- namely the little girl investigator who witnessed the demon appear in her own home.

A HAUNTING, the series, was beginning to unravel in Season 4, but I hoped the producers mailed it in because they knew the show wouldn't be renewed. Now I can see they just lost the recipe.

COMPARING THE CREW

SUMMERWINDs capable writing was a collaboration between Fred Mills and series producer Larry Silverman, who limited himself to an executive producer role for BLOOD VISIONS. I guess we have only Michael Ray Brown to blame for the writing of BLOOD VISIONS.

BLOOD VISIONS lists no cinematographers among its cast and crew whereas SUMMERWIND carries both Ray Brown and Michael Bratkowski.

Katherine Pritchard remains the only holdover from the SUMMERWIND Art Department, but BLOOD VISIONS employs no construction coordinator (Ryan Brinkley), set dressing leadman (Kate Forry), property master (Kathleen Martin), production graphics (Chuck Newsome), art direction (Jack Ryan), set decoration (Angela Castillo), or painter (Jackie Smith). Now perhaps some of these positions were consolidated in BLOOD VISIONS, but therein could lie a problem as well.

The SUMMERWIND sound department is also more complex. While both employ sound recordists (BLOOD VISIONS actually employs one more than SUMMERWIND), BLOOD VISIONS does not employ sound editors (Larry Goeb & James Cret Wilson), sound supervisor (Mike Puckett), or a production sound mixer (Kenneth Altman). This may explain why we love the original sound in the early episodes. There is a great deal of attention paid to the sound and the music, and each early episode has its own score that sets it apart. BLOOD VISIONS did not appear to have an original score.

SUMMERWIND employ costume designers (Rebecca Kurtz and Lance Culpepper) while BLOOD VISIONS scales this back to Rebecca Kurtz. BLOOD VISIONS lacks a makeup department (Terea Gorsick).

SUMMERWIND also has an elaborate production staff that appears to be missing entirely from BLOOD VISIONS. Executive in charge of production Nicolas Valcour I suspect was key in the program's early success. He did not return for Season 5. Neither did production VP Michelle LeDoux. SUMMERWIND also carries an array of directors, including Vernon Guinn (first assistant director), Roz Victa (second assistant director), and Joe Wiecha (field director). SUMMERWIND also credits 3 production coordinators, a production assistant, and a location manager, none of which are listed for BLOOD VISIONS. Other than that the 4 episode producers are the same.

SUMMERWIND differentiates between ""special effects"" (Anthony Torres) and ""visual effects"" (Meliza Fermin, visual effects artist and Joe Pitts, visual effects coordinator). No one is credited for BLOOD VISIONS.

SUMMERWIND retains an editoral department of 5, including a post-production coordinator, two online editors, and a supervising and assistant editor, whereas BLOOD VISIONS makes due with Alex J. Spence.

SUMMERWIND retains a camera and electrical department of 10, compared to the 2 employed by BLOOD VISIONS.

And then of course, there's the acting. Kera O'Bryon (also in GATEWAY TO HELL), Scott Rollins (also in DEMON CHILD and HUNGRY GHOSTS), Justin Dray, and Marcello Rollando perform capably in SUMMERWIND to deliver that very amusing Hinshaw family quirkiness that comes across in clips from the interviews. We feel for this family, yes, but we also laugh a little at how they cope with the haunting and the aggregate effect of all this is we harbor a mild affection for them. The same could not be said of the family from BLOOD VISIONS. None of the actors in BLOOD VISIONS is listed in the IMDB full cast and crew, so I cannot put any names to the horrible acting.",1350432000,3,10033,5.012605042016807
5525386,3,B00AX5B0O2,"This series occasionally delivers and you will find some chilling and thought-provoking moments that are quite satisfying for the horror aficionado. However, I did find each episode to be rather drawn out and at times the story-telling was flat and lost momentum. the re-enactments were for mostly effective but the interviews often slowed the stories down and were close to redundant. I think that the series would benefit from some tighter editing. The main problem, for me though, was that too many episodes were very similar, so that the first few minutes were enough to show that a particular episode would be a different version of one already watched. I also found that each story ended rather too neatly, so there was little in terms of suspense.",1473033600,,754,4.94488188976378

The stories all seemed so explainable and felt more like someone suffering from psychotic break rather than something of the unknown. I am far from a skeptic, I watch everything on aliens and love stuff about the unknown, but the pacing of the stories mixed with things that didn't seem that strange to me was off putting.

Something else I noticed as well was in the new intro, ""In America (or something like that)"" replaced ""In this world"". Does that mean they're only going to stick to stories from the US and not from around the world? I actually enjoyed that aspect of the show as well.

If you find shows like this amusing, then you'll get a lot of entertainment out of this set.  This is a show my son and I have watched together for years, pointing out the inconsistencies in the story line, the perfectly logical explanations that are ignored, the key family members who don't appear in the episodes, the people who are trying to sell a book or book events in a ""haunted house"", the times where the appearance of ghosts in a house seems to happen when people buy a house that they can't afford,  etc....

In the older seasons you'd see the actors preform actions but when they talked it was low and the narrator talked over them so they could basically get anyone to be in the show and it wohld look good.  In this season they chucked that brilliant idea out the window and decided to let these people try to act it out.  Seasons 1-4 I could binge on, watching episode after episode but these I can just stomach one at a time.

One other problem is the earlier seasons were well known ghost stories for the most part with fresh stuff peppered in but none of these were note worthy.  That would have been alright, it was mainly the acting that killed these for me.",1391472000,2,720,4.343283582089552

I was actually quite disappointed with the overuse of CGI, and how the ghosts and demons didn't have the same quality as the previous seasons. However, this season does have some good episodes that make it worth the purchase. I had already seen this season over the TV, but the DVD was needed in order to complete the collection. I already have two original movies (A Haunting in Georgia, A Haunting in Connecticut), and the boxed set of the first four seasons.

Product arrived on time. The package was in surprisingly good condition. I would buy from this seller again. While season five may not be the best season of A Haunting, it's certainly worth having -- even if only to complete a collection.",1387411200,,757,4.5661764705882355

Obviously the director wanted to create sinister atmospheric scenes but all he created was scene after of of darkness.

Changing networks, and cutting funding and man power on the show was something people said made the show less of what it use to be, so when I finally did see a couple of episodes, I had that in the back of my mind, so I didn't really like the new season, at first.

5525472,1,B00AX5B0O2,"Season 5 is not your older brother's A Haunting. After a surprisingly sub-par premiere, I examined the ""cast and crew"" of BLOOD VISIONS with that of a smoldering and delightfully nuanced Season 1 favorite, THE HAUNTING OF SUMMERWIND. The reason for the drop-off in quality became apparent: a near total turnover in production staff.

I waited 4 years for new episodes and put a great deal of pressure on myself to like the premiere as did many of you -- I can tell. But unlike some of you who will not be honest with yourself or others - I am not going to wave my pom-poms in some denial or inability to tolerate dissonance.

The episode begins amusingly enough, with a shot of the soon-to-be-possessed Detroit pot-bellied teen in a motley wife-beater. I always did enjoy the way the program captured the quirkiness of the haunting victims. But THIS was just bad. Acting that doesn't belong on any size screen and excerpts from interviews that fell flat.

I understand why this program was moved to DESTINATION America. The characters talked like tour guides, explaining to each other everything that was going on right in front of their eyes (and that we can plainly see at home). No one talks like this in real life. You get that, Michael Ray Brown? Not even Anthony Call sounded normal with this script. And yet this lack of subtlety was somehow topped by the plainly visible hand of the computer in the CGI effects. Ghost stories are one place where less is more in the CGI department. Yet from all appearances, BLOOD VISIONS was vying to overtake Star Wars. The black smoky ectoplasmic like substance on the ceiling -- rendered capably in the 2005 episode CURSED -- looks entirely digitized in BLOOD VISIONS. It's the CGI equivalent of seeing the strings holding up the planets in 1950s Flash Gordon films. Nothing throws a wet towel over a creepy atmospheric vibe better than overly-wrought and exposed computer graphics. I didn't know whether to blame less skilled staff, less psychologically sophisticated minds, or technology itself - but BLOOD VISIONS was less Industrial Light and Magic and more Atari. The reality of ghostly phenomena is subtle, organic, and mysterious, and this should play into the hands of good film-making, which stirs our soul by leaving a little to the imagination and by sacrificing stylization for grit. Not BLOOD VISIONS, where the demon actually advances on the girl ""investigator"" in her OWN HOME and she chases hollering ""We are going to help that family!"" Pathetic.

The editing and effects were nothing short of dizzying and had me wondering whether the entire crew should be put on Ritalin. When you can't tell a story well, the lack of wit and believability is all the more exposed. Seasons 1-4 met their burden -- selling us on some rather unbelievable events. I didn't question the credibility of Season 2 WHERE DEMONS DWELL in which Satan Himself crawls out from a well behind a rental property in rural Connecticut, and yet I doubted everything depicted in BLOOD VISIONS. If I learned anything from seasons 1-4, smudging does not work and 16-year-old valley girls with no background in science or connection to the Church can chase demons away. Unless of course the prayer read off that single sheet of paper was actually the script for last night's episode, which could probably chase anything on Heaven and Earth.

Season 5 plays too loose with the source material. Perhaps the absence of an active research manager is responsible. There were some rather fascinating aspects to the Summerwind Haunting left out of the episode (i.e., rooms changing dimensions, double exposures, corpse in crawl space) because of decisions to include only that for which there's strong or converging evidence. But a number of things occur in BLOOD VISIONS for which the crew accepted on faith the account of a single person (i.e., appearance of demon in home of investigator).

New Details on the Recipe: Decline in Season 5 Explained

The series owes its soul to a formula -- an interweaving of certain parts narration, certain parts character acting, and certain parts interview -- and seasons 1-2 achieved an optimal balance whereby the actors are primarily seen but not heard. Even when they speak in the episodes, their speech is indistinct, overwritten by a layer of audio that is narrator or interview. The dialog -- or really I should say ""monologue"" -- of the actors bleeds through in single words or phrases but much of it covered over and we are largely watching the actors behave while listening to the real haunting victims or the narrator talk. This perhaps most evident in season 1. In season 2 there is a slight change in protocol where the actors are not overlaid with interview/narration but INTERRUPTED for interview/narration. I prefer season 1 to season 2 in this regard but it's mainly a matter of emphasis and there's no loss of quality between these seasons. The tactic covers up or smooths over deficiencies in writing and acting. In Seasons 3 and 4 we see a modest decline where the actors are given more audible lines and dialog overtakes monologue. By season 5, the shift is so pronounced, that the true capabilities of the writers and actors are exposed. Actors who returned for roles in Season 5 appear less skilled than in their Season 1 or 2 episode. Did they lose their talents? No. It's partly the dialog they are given, which is poorer, but more to the point, it's the loss of this ""formula"" I described for the first 2 seasons.

The soul of the series itself is imperiled by this transition. The original formula created a Kubrick-like effect where even hauntings of small rooms appeared on a grand stage and with tremendous atmosphere (i.e., overtone of the grave). The hauntings had much more stage presence and touched us at a deeper level.",1374537600,7,5812,4.851814516129032

5525494,4,B00AX5B0O2,"Thank you Discovery/Destination America for hearing my request to put Season 5 of my one of my favorite paranormal shows ""A Haunting"" on DVD. This was for all those who can't get that particular TV channel (such as myself). And thank you Amazon for letting me purchase it here. Now let's get down to it. Season 5 in a nutshell was very good IMO. I actually liked the updates to the show. It made the show fresh and current. You can't be on ice for 5 years and come back like when it debuted. And the stories were still interesting for the most part. And I was glad Anthony (AKA Tony) Call is still the narrator. It just wouldn't be A Haunting without him. I admit, I found some of the new special effects (IE: the hand crawling up the sheet on the bed) a little cheesy and non-believable but aside from that, the show still had the elements that I liked about it in the first place. I see a lot of reviewers mention the show being less scary. A Haunting isn't really about being scary. It's not a horror movie. It's a show about real people who've had or encountered paranormal experiences. So I wasn't expecting it to be like the movie Saw or Paranormal Activity. However, I notice the suspense element was a bit more subdued this season. The build up of the stories weren't as intense and suspenseful.

I purchased all four seasons, and the two pilot episodes, and still watch them all frequently to this day. When I head the news that a revival 5th season was airing, I was ecstatic! I was even more ecstatic to learn that a full DVD release was planed. It was one of those ""shut up and take my money"" moments. Pre-Ordered! The DVD was released on April 23rd, the same day it was shipped off. I was extremely surprised to find it waiting at my door the very next day! Way to go Amazon with the speedy shipping!

Season Five of A Haunting revives the series with improvements throughout. Both the acting (in the reenactments) and special effects are drastically improved from the previous seasons. Not one of the episodes in this season will leave you without one particular moment to think about afterwards, keeping you awake at night. One of my particular favorite moments is in the episode ""Nightmare Upstairs"" where an entity without a face manages to take the form of a family member brushing her hair in the mirror; it's one of the creepiest shots in the entire series.

If you loved the previous seasons, you'll easily be able to look past the small changes that were made to air the new season on Destination America; (cue the new ""In America, there is real evil..."" not the old ""In this World, there is real evil..."" Guess there won't be any episodes taking place out of the states in the seasons to come) The opening music alone will give any fan the notion that A Haunting isn't messing around, and that it's a series with integrity. No more jump scares and music crescendos to try and frighten the audience. This time, the stories can do it on their own...",1366934400,,1783,4.5514018691588785
5525501,5,B00AX5B0O2,"Although seasons 1 through 4 were excellent, Season 5 is just a little bit better. It's only a little different from the fist seasons. The music is almost 80% different, except here and there you can hear some of the same background music from the first seasons. It brings a connection of the gap between the first years and the fifth year of this show. Plus, there are some actors from the first seasons playing in the fifth.

It just seems a little more polished and energized more this time around. My only complaint, which is minor, is the special visual lighting effects. In the first seasons, the lighting was more shadows. In Season 5, it's more jerky camera and digital camera washes.

But you can't go wrong with this 10 story set. I just wish there was MORE!",1366675200,24,768,4.517985611510792

5525505,5,B00AX5B0O2,"With about 5 years in the making since the close of Season 4, Discovery Channel has finally resuscitated this almost forgotten series! I'm relived to know that Discovery Channel has continued with this successful program. If only they could have done the same for ""Exorcist Diaries"" - another forgotten program that was left in the back-burner!

OK. In Season 5 of ""A Haunting"", we get to know of equally terrifying encounters of the spirit world and those human victims who have stumbled across their paths.

I'm VERY DISAPPOINTED to know that many of these victims are still left without any positive solutions in most of these unsolved cases! The featured human victims come mainly from the working and middle class and are mostly unbelievers, atheists, skeptics, and some Protestants. Many of them are left hanging in the air without any answers. I wish I can shake them ALL and let them know that there ARE positive solutions to their plight! LOL! As I poured through each of their cases, I already know what to so and where to go and how to go about solving EVERY CASE! Yet, those victims kept looking at all the wrong places for their answers! What a faithless culture America has degenerated into! Why would they approach all those silly and USELESS agnostic ""paranormal research societies""?!!!! Can their EMF metres and video cameras chase away supernatural entities? They all a bunch of silly JOKERS pretending to help those victims! They're all a bunch of useless FOOLS!

We're dealing with the supernatural world here, not one you can place in a bottle and study under a microscope with all your technological gadgetry! The answers you get from those ""helpful"" pretenders goes something like that unhelpful woman in Episode 6: ""OK, we got a EVP on tape, we've confirmed that the phenomena you're experiencing is of supernatural origin, but sorry, we can't help you get rid of it!"" ROFLMAO!!!!! That family then approached their Protestant pastor whose prayers are equally useless and ineffective! LOL! I already know the answers to their case 15 mins into hearing their tale.

If the producers of this series are responsible enough to help those victims, they should call for a Traditional Catholic priest who knows about these things and who is more effective than his Modernist / Liberal counterparts. A Traditional Catholic Exorcist is called only as a last resort in the most difficult cases. 97% of the time, a Traditional Catholic priest with the relevant training would suffice. Ignore those Liberal Catholic priests who fill the ranks of the modern mainstream dioceses, their lack of faith is detrimental to the Work. Get the Traditional Catholic priest to do more than just a simple blessing. A simple blessing isn't effective enough for the victims featured in this ""A Haunting"" series.

In the case studies featured in ""A Haunting"", we see many haunted houses, so we've to work on the houses, their respective histories in relation to the histories of previous occupants (eg. any previous deaths, murders, suicides, devil worship in the houses, Native Indian burial grounds, etc.). Determine if the source of the haunting is human or inhuman, or both. You'll want a series of rounds of blessings and banishments customised for that specific type of haunting. Here's a TIP: people think that they can call a priest for help, expect a wand to be waved and things would get back to a state they expect. You think you're treating a bout of flu? Pop a pill and hope to get well the next day or week? In reality, the real world doesn't work that way! If the victims, or someone closely connected to them, are living in MORTAL SIN and living unhealthy (read: sinful) lifestyles, then they should work on cleansing THEMSELVES, as much as they seek help in cleansing their surroundings!

Of course for those who were big fans such as myself, we all have the first 4 seasons on DVD I'm sure. After the cancellation, I didn't think the show would be back on the air. Which leads me to say, I didn't even know they put it back on the air last year via Destination America (another spin off station of the Discovery Channel just as the ID channel is). But I guess it's better late than never right. Ok, so getting to the point. I caught up on Season 5 through the digital market obviously (Amazon/I-Tunes)because I don't get the Destination America channel. Anyway, I really enjoyed and liked season 5 over all. It was really good, it kept my interest just enough to get back in it. As someone said in their review prior, I did detect a change in Anthony (AKA Tony) Call's voice. Not his narration but his voice. It sounds as if he developed some sort of lisp or something. There was a vocal change, and he didn't sound as clear as he previously did. Aside from that minor change, season 5 was off to a nice start. I hope they plan on doing a season 6.

Oh, there must have been only 4 seasons made. Too bad I thought, that's a pretty good show. Regardless, I still watched them repeatedly. Yeah, there were little things I laughed about to myself, like how the same white plastic translucent bottle of holy water was used in every other episode, and the rental house in the episode ""Where Demons Dwell"" was spotted in at least two other episodes. Still, pretty entertaining, and I wished there was more.

Then I saw Destination America was reviving the show, and I was excited. Obviously someone else, be it producers or fans,  thought it was worthy of a second chance. The commercial for the new season was the first thing that stuck me to be odd. A cloaked figure with white pancake makeup and black makeup around his eyes staring at the camera. ""That was pretty bad"", I thought to myself, I hope that's not indicative of what the new season is going to be like. But alas, it was.

I watched Blood Visions with head shaking disappointment (or maybe it was disbelief) of how they somehow managed to ruin this show. The opening had changed, the acting was horrendous, the special effects were something out of a Youtube video. Even Tony Call's narration was not the same as it was before, which left me with the only conclusion that some drastic changes had been made to the writing and production staff. As I found the other reviews on this page from other people that know the show better and are able to put it into better words, I saw that I was correct in my assumption. I suppose all that can be done is to hope someone at Destination America reads these reviews and is able to salvage this show before it completely tanks. Of course the best part of this show are the actual people telling their stories, but without believable reenactments, it just falls flatter than Wile E Coyote off of a high desert cliff.

5525533,2,B00AX5B0O2,"NIGHTMARE IN BRIDGEPORT draws some parallels to arguably the most chilling episode of the HAUNTING series (this side of a HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT) ... A HAUNTING IN FLORIDA. A haunted rambler. Check. Ghosts resulting from deaths on the property. Check. A father with a background in the armed services. Check. A demonic presence. Check. An unsuccessful attempt at a cleansing or exorcism. Check. A house abandoned and that to this day remains unoccupied. Check. No question we have all the elements of an interesting story. So why didn't I feel the haunt? Why did the Billy Idol wraithlike rendering of the demon in NIGHTMARE IN BRIDGEPORT fail to frighten me as much as the misty black figure that leaned over the baby's crib?

FLORIDA was built on the fundamentals of storytelling. Information was delivered in its proper course and in the right sequence so that tension could be escalated and released. There could be no answers before there are questions, and the storytelling brought out in its viewers an intrigue -- a curiosity -- that prepared them and foreshadowed developments yet to come. The maze was built and we were led through the maze.

By contrast NIGHTMARE IN BRIDGEPORT reveals within the first few minutes a male ghost, a voice through a heat vent, and human bodies buried beneath the home. Even before that, the episode opens by giving us a glimpse of its conclusion (an unsavory feature of all Season 5 episodes to date), in which the bishop is pushed down the stairs to the basement. This convoluted arrangement undercuts tension, intrigue, and rhythm. A well-told story is like a melody. I never realized that until I heard this disharmonious mess that was as much a labor to follow as it must have been to tell. I guess I'll have to go back to ""humming"" chords from SUMMERWIND and FLORIDA like I did at times over the past 5 years.

The highlight of NIGHTMARE IN BRIDGEPORT takes place when the child haunting victim turned paranormal investigator opens an investigation into his own haunting by reviewing photos of the home and discovering in the magnification of the orb the mouth of the demon he'd seen in the basement. How much more compelling this could have been if the orb was given a somewhat more organic (i.e., less CGI) quality and if the demon was creepier. One need not look to the chauffer from Burnt Offerings (1976) played by Anthony James (mercifully no photo available on IMDB) or the face of the floating Ralphie Glick from the 1979 Salem's Lot to find inspiration. One could look as close as the demon from HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT, the ghost ""Joseph"" from THE WHEATSHEAF HORROR, the floating head of the female demon in THE PRESENCE, the faces in the photos from THE ATTIC, or the obscure face in the window of HIDDEN TERROR.

As with the preceding two episodes, the special effects used to transition between scenes feel as indigenous to the story as a prosthetic limb. They have a clunky post hoc feel to them. Before the HAUNTING series fell into its five year coma, these effects felt like an intrinsic, ""organic"" part of the scenes they precede and follow -- a natural and subtle segue.

The writing was its usual Season 5 horrendous self. Pray tell does Tony Call cringe before -- or after he reads lines like ""but Bobby cannot hide from the horrible thing that's about to happen?"" This is revolting dialog.

The acting is no better. I like the fact that the production staff realizes that the quirkiness of the character acting is a strength and source of stimulation for Seasons 1-4. But there's a difference between quirky and dreadfully bad. I recognize five of the actors from previous seasons, including from this episode Jennifer Pulley (Stalked by Evil, 2007), Kiersten Armstrong (Echoes from the Past (2007), and the spiritualist from The Attic (2006). The fact their acting is far worse this season probably has less to do with any diminution in skills -- after all they're not aging gymnasts -- and more to do with writing and directing. Not only are they saddled with revolting dialog, but I'd swear there was no one directing. I am also inclined to think that with the exception of a few returning actors, the program now gets its actors from a different registry / service. With the exception of an appropriately demure / subdued son from ANGELS & DEMONS, the bizarre acting from the children in these episodes looks less like character eccentricity and more like a blend of cognitive impairment and developmental disorder.

And in addition to those four actors, something else about Nightmare in Bridgeport harkens back to the original seasons. The soundtrack. NIGHTMARE IN BRIDGEPORT recycled the theme from WHERE DEMONS DWELL. What made each episode from the first four seasons special was that each had its own original score. The sound production was an integral part of the supernatural overtone in the first four seasons. This element is a conspicuous no-show three episodes into Season 5.

I feel for the people who have to endure these hauntings. I'm sure they go through hell, and I'm sure they're grateful someone is telling their stories. Now let's tell these stories well.

REVIEW OF SEASON 5 EPISODE 5: DARK DREAMS

I am only allowed one review per product, so I will have to append my thoughts on this latest episode to the end of this review.

Just when you thought it was safe ... safe to believe New Dominion could not turn out anything worse than BLOOD VISIONS, Haunting series producers send a clear message that with DARK DREAMS their capacities are not to be underestimated. Why stop at jumping the shark? -- when you can hit rock bottom.

Mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are diagnosed for both their positive symptoms (i.e., word salad, delusions) and their negative symptoms (i.e., social withdrawal, lack of emotion). In a similar vein, A Haunting Season 5 has shown a poverty of writing, acting, sound, and cinematography (negative symptoms) as well as visually neauseating transition effects and the insane delusion that viewers are moved (positive symptoms). All of these ""symptoms"" are harmful to the story, but never has an episode told the story so poorly - as to make the program incoherent and difficult to follow. My reference to schizophrenia was inspired by DARK DREAMS, whose storyboarding resembled a salad of dialog and images that broke every rule when it came to good structure in much the same way an old social experiment of mine from the Appalachian Mountains violated every rule of grammar when he spoke. Just because the story of Gibbons' haunting features some bad dreams does not mean the episode itself has to resemble one. I found myself when reviewing this episode struggling to make sense of how it did not make sense.

I am going to give Christopher Gibbons, author of Trespass, the benefit of the doubt in assuming the real events on which DARK DREAMS was based were in fact scary and interesting. This did not come out in the episode. In fact I laughed more than I should have during this episode, where the most ghost-like disembodied aspect of the whole program were the teeth of the actor portraying Gibbons. (You may want to use a little less whitening agent). If I had been throwing back any sort of fluid (whether it was whiskey or milk) it would have come out through my nose during the rendering of Gibbons' dream of being lifted and pushed out the window on invisible meat hooks. Given a camera, director's chair, and editing equipment, I could have established and escalated the tension right up to its harrowing conclusion -- because somehow I don't think Gibbons found anything funny about his dream. Just a guess.

If I have to single out one troubling moment from the episode, I refer to the scene that takes place AFTER everyone agreed the ghost had been banished from the home. Gibbons opens the cupboard and tangles with what appears to be a swarm of flies (the ghost) but we quickly find out the battle takes place in his head (i.e, a dream) and he is really asleep -- only he is not in bed but fully clothed -- and sitting up! -- during a family meeting in the living room. Talk about confusing.

And I know I sound like a broken record at this point, but can we please make the ghosts look less computer generated? As it is the series has to fight its 10PM time slot on DESTINATION America where a story aspiring to be taken seriously as a haunting tale is interrupted for QuiBids ads and ads promoting shows about moonshiners and barbecue grillmasters. (Nothing stokes the flames of skepticism more than a high-definition Samsung television for seven dollars and sixty-eight cents). But the program was totally incapable at generating the least bit of fear or suspense over the opening of a cupboard we were led to believe contained a ghost. Somehow we knew whatever jumped out at us would underwhelm and we just wanted to be done with it!",1351296000,2,8888,4.781107491856678
5525534,3,B00AX5B0O2,"After Sub-Par Premiere, ANGELS & DEMONS Restores Measure of Hope, But ...

After a brutally bad premiere episode BLOOD VISIONS, ANGELS & DEMONS restores a measure of hope for the resurrection of A HAUNTING from its five year hiatus. While still plagued by bad writing and hyperactive CGI that undercuts the atmosphere, the problems were not severe enough to obscure an interesting story. The interview clips were more substantive and animated and had more to contribute and were utilized less perfunctorily and with more purpose than in BLOOD VISIONS. The use of special effects, while obnoxious in transitioning between scenes (and during the climactic exorcism), were executed effectively in portraying the movement of the back-pack and the sleeptalking of the acutely possessed son, whose verbal regurgitation of an argument he was not present to hear had struck that first vital stranger-than-fiction note of the season. The strength of the series has always been the depiction of events that parodoxically strain and support credibility in that they seem unlikely inventions of the imagination.

ANGELS & DEMONS imitates some of the successful aspects of Seasons 1-4 but it fails to re-capture the soul of the series.

The program however continues to suffer from writing problems, particularly in the area of dialog. I'm inclined to say the episode was written for ABC Daytime but some of those daytime dramas are actually superior on this score. Written for daytime soaps, acted for the theater. It's as if the actors were instructed by the director: ""the audience is hard of hearing, blind in one eye, and one standard deviation short of the median IQ. This was evidenced in Karen Carbone, whose acting skills I would have deemed gag-worthy if she had not come off so well as Jan Foster in the Season 2 episode DEMON CHILD.

Narrator Tony Call is another casualty of a poor script. What a waste of a master craftsman. His lines are dreadfully on-the-nose. While words like ""the shocking answer would come all too soon"" fit seamlessly and added to the suspense of season 1 episode ECHOES FROM THE GRAVE, the line ""little did she know it would become her worst nightmare"" struck me as juvenile and like the interview from BLOOD VISIONS, formulaic. As in BLOOD VISIONS, the narration contributed little of value, telling us either what we already knew, what was unfolding before our eyes, or did not need to know. In BLOOD VISIONS, when the possessed teen hears the disembodied voice of the demon -- ""Die Now"" -- the voice of Tony Call reminding us that it was ""the same phrase written on the bathroom mirror"" only blunted its impact and prompted my wife to ask, ""how stupid does this program think we are?"" At the end of ANGELS & DEMONS, a new individual is introduced in an interview clip that had my wife and I simultaneously asking one another: ""Who is this woman?"" We were able to determine it was the friend and Tarot card reader, but the lack of set-up made for an odd moment that disrupted the flow. Building a quality program begins from the ground up or the inside out, to borrow some clichd metaphors and that means greater emphasis on writing. Writing. Writing. Writing.",1351036800,4,3187,4.88539741219963
5525535,3,B00AX5B0O2,"I basically agree with 90% of the previous posters comments. I too was  a huge fan of the past few seasons,even going so far as to  write  the broadcasting channel when it was announced that the show had been definitely cancelled sometime  right after the end of last season. Quite  a few people had started  a sort of petition online,urging other viewers to write the TV channel requesting MORE.
Neddless to say, I was ecstatic to suddenly discover  a new season of  A Haunting in  the new Fall programming, despite  a change of channel. I don't know if the show is still  done by New Dominion Pictures(who then used to sell  the episodes ready to play to the TV channel) but right from the intro I could tell the quality had gone  down an awful lot. The deep scary voice was gone, the visuals looked so cheap and fake...It has lost much of its credibility-or possible credibility- to the open minded 28yr old adult i am today. Maybe theyve gained a new,  less discerning, audience with little kids under 10 ?After watching the first two episodes Im still praying the next to come will somehow be better and save me from complete disappointment. Honestly at this point I get way more pleasure rewatching reruns of the old version/previous 4 seasons which i purchased as  a DVD  box set right here on Amazon, even though I know all the stories by heart and  know every minute what's going to happen next. Sure hope we can look forward to an improvement in the next few episodes ?As  a die hard fan  who so desperately wants it to WORK i WILL press on for another few episodes in the hope of better...otherwise  the series has generated quite  a few pretty good wanna-be copies that are playing out there on other channels.",1350950400,12,1722,4.525974025974026

8558744,4,B00AX5B0O2,"I see since Andrew Monument left the production team at the end of season 4, the quality of the editing and the graphics dropped quite a lot. He's an insanely talented film editor and one of my editing heroes. The original show open in SE:1 - 4, is one of the most memorable show intros of all time. He invented the glitch style editing for Network Television's small screen. Now everyone ""tries"" to use it but usually not effectively. All in all, it's still a good show and one of the best Docu-Drama shows on the supernatural ever produced.

* Several of the shows in which a non-human entity, or demon are encountered, they're usually unable to remove them. Demons are very, VERY, rare. But there is a reason they're so hard to get rid of. They normally ONLY show up when they are summoned for a specific task. They have to be called buy a magician  ( or someone wanting to be one - just to see. They'll see alright!). But someone like that who is a diabolist and works from the Goetic literature, knows to work with The Angels first for many years and have a solid relationship with them. You don't ask someone you just met for favors. The GREATER -> control the lesser. So there are rules. The only person that can get rid of it, is the person that called it to begin with and they may no longer be occupying the location, or no longer alive.",1489276800,,1347,4.341269841269841
