2604402,4,B000GBEWKW,"Vampire movies should be sexy. Too often they offer violence and bloody scares and ignore the heritage of Dracula and the classics of this genre which first and foremost were seductive and threatening. This video puts the heroine in harms way but definitely with a lesbian seduction connotation. You aren't sure what the leader of this coven of female vampires want with her soul but it's pretty clear what they have in mind for her body. The use of dream sequences and internet web sites brings both the danger and the irresistible attraction of these undead quite apparent. David Carradine does a good job as the modern day but anachronistic Van Helsing but the female leads are who make this movie good sexy horror. Both are very good looking and play their respective parts as pursuer and innocent very well. Beautifullyl filmed, especially the dream sequences. A good notch above the usual for this kind of film.",1361923200,6,917,4.8471337579617835
2604403,3,B000GBEWKW,"Sydney (Natalie Brown) is a writer doing a story on a dating website called Artemis. Artemis is very female-friendly, catering to the needs of women. It's also a haven for vampires. David Carradine plays a vampire hunter (Abraham Van Helsing ""Jr."" I suppose), seemingly in a completely separate movie for the bulk of the film. He jams on the flute. He gets an old guy with giant nerd glasses to do the heavy lifting in terms of destroying this vampire sect. Am I really supposed to believe the guy is a badass? The Last Sect is one slow story, but I stuck with it till the end, so I guess I can't say it wasn't a little intriguing. The soundtrack was provided by the poor man's Elastica (""The Duke Spirit""). Distracting.",1361232000,,720,4.5038167938931295
2604404,4,B000GBEWKW,"There have been some complaints about this film:  Not enough gore.  Not enough eroticism.  Slow-moving.

But for me, it was a tantalizing diversion for a lazy Sunday morning.  While the writers lose points for making Carradine a descendant of Van Helsing--a bit overdone, in my opinion--I have to hand it to them for knowing their mythology.  Warning:  Spoilers follow.

Though there are both male and female creatures of the night in this film, only the women are credited as vampires.  The victims they feast upon later rise to become ghouls, fitting the original myths of the medieval revenant who dwells in tombs, attracts plague, and feeds on corpses.  The vampires are portrayed in the spirit of the Keats's poem  ""Lamia,"" in which a temptress lures innocents to their doom.  The matriarchal structure of the film's vampire clan is pitted against what some might see as traditional, patriarchal Church forces.

As a practicing Christian, I do understand the impulse to interpret the film as a mere allegory for the struggle of women to overthrow the patriarchy.  But, the director does not stop there.  After all, all that lives must die.  Do the vampires fulfill nature?  Or corrupt it?  Are they eco-friendly survivors whose customs seem strange by our patriarchal standards?  Or are they monsters, with no place in the Grand Design?

With these questions raised, I was satisfied intellectually.  I had no need for blood and gore.  There was plenty of eroticism, for my tastes.  No need for explicit sex.  We can see the seduction is there.  It's a subtle work, and I would buy it on DVD.

Oh.  And the fight scenes are wicked awesome!",1213488000,7,1643,4.88
2604405,3,B000GBEWKW,"This film has very good production values, and a reasonably good story-line; a female journalist decides to investigate a web-cam site called Artemis where it appears women act out vampiristic rituals on some poor man - of course she believes it's all trickery.

She goes to interview the head vampire-lady and even upon shaking hands her mind is flooded with erotic lesbian imagery. Unfortunately that's about as far as it goes.

She is met with the vampire lady a few more times, and feels this growing desire, but in the end it comes to nothing really.

I was expecting, as the cover shows, that the head vampire lady would at least bite her in the neck.

In other words this film is full of tantalising images that don't really go anywhere. And for that I was very annoyed. The closest she gets is a bit of blood on her lips but we're not really sure if this is real, or another of her fantastic erotic day-dreams

A much better erotic-vampire film (although no fangs) is Eternal",1159142400,13,983,4.5625
2604406,4,B000GBEWKW,ive literally seen every vampire movie from the late 30's to present.  This is in the top tier.  Nothing flashy but entertaining.,1496793600,,129,4.818181818181818
2604407,3,B000GBEWKW,"This is the second separate edit of this film I have seen. The first one was probably nearly 10 years ago. The ending is the same, but the story was expanded and modified slightly again. This movie was not really all that great for the genre. It was simply softcore porn. No edit of this film can ever erase that fact.",1495929600,,318,4.229508196721311

2604414,3,B000GBEWKW,"Not David Candide's best acting, in fact very poor. The rest of the cast followed suit. Don't waste you money on this one. It's alright for a flick to have on while your doing something else though.",1400716800,,198,4.378378378378378

8130384,3,B000GBEWKW,"Gave it 3 stars simply because the Late, Great David Carradine was in the movie. Still the idea of female vamps sucking the life out of pervy men was a great story line in theory...but in practice this movie most definitely needed a script doctor to make it palatable. Too bad because  in today's society where the headlines are filled with the disgusting abuses permitted by Harvey W's & their ilks, the creation of a movie which allows said misogynists to be the oppressed & therefore subjugated to the abuses of female vampires would be welcomed for the needed lessons these men deserve. The idea of a website where men frequently visit said websites to fulfill their so-called superior carnal desires, coupled with the reverse psychology of female vampires torturing them, had the makings of an excellent film. One I believe would surely been lauded by many viewers, especially Feminists...I know I would have applauded! Unfortunately the script & several actors were unable to carry the needs of such an ironic vision. Too bad really!",1508284800,,1039,4.937142857142857
8130385,3,B000GBEWKW,"Natalie Brown's acting was too good for this movie. just so much more realistic, that it didn't fit the low budget movie. still it was good to see  David Carradine again.",1507766400,,170,4.483870967741935
8130386,5,B000GBEWKW,I must say this movie was a lot better than I thought it was going to be.  Very intriguing and imaginative. I would really like to see a sequel made.,1503273600,,149,3.966666666666667
8130387,4,B000GBEWKW,Ok I am sorry but old man van helsing has no chance against vampires it is just ridiculous he would still be alive. The wooden bullets are always so funny that it is the wood that kills them because the steak has to stay in the heart to keep them in the grave but doesn't kill them only decapitation does,1502064000,,304,4.083333333333333
8130388,4,B000GBEWKW,"A group of vampire, led by the ancient and beautiful Anna (elegantly portrayed by Deborah Odell), must hibernate for a quarter century at the beginning of each millennium to regenerate themselves. For this they must find the chosen one who will protect them during their deep sleep. Anna creates a dating service website to attract victims a troll for the chosen one (Natalie Brown). An apprentice of Van Helsing (David Carradine) .realizes it is more than a fake, kinky website, and so the race is on. I very much enjoyed the story's unique take on the vampire genre, and I liked enough of the characters on both sides of the battle.that I remained engaged throughout. What will the chosen one choose? Any number of endings could be written, and if this ending isn't to your liking... make up your own. For me it was the journey, not the destination.",1501977600,,851,4.718120805369128
