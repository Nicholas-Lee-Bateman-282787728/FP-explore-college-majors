8146373,3,B000IMVPAE,"If you can stomach Charlie Rose's exasperating, interruptive, imbecilic style of interviewing, then this program with John C. Reilly and the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who were then co-starring in Sam Shepard's play TRUE WEST, is worth the exorbitant cost of the DVD burn. I saw the stage production at NYC's Circle in the Square with Hoffman as Lee and Reilly as Austin, and it was brilliant. It's a pity that superb stage production wasn't captured on film and then made available as a DVD. Hoffman and Reilly epitomize great acting, and I deeply miss Hoffman, who passed away earlier this year. As for Charlie Rose, let me put it this way: he is to TV interviewing what Michael Jackson was to child day-care giving.
