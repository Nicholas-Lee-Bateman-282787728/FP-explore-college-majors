6797976,5,B00PCZF3E6,Fantastic! Believable characters and acting! Cinematography was great as well! I would rate this one at the top of this genre!!,1420588800,,127,5.095238095238095
6797977,5,B00PCZF3E6,"I loved this movie. I loved the book when I read it so I was really anxious to get the movie when I found out about it and I was not disappointed at all. The tension and the emotion was there and no, the actors weren't Oscar worthy, but it was about their ability to get the story across, to make you feel it, and they did. And it's just so good to have an interracial, gay romance movie where one, or both, of the MCs don't die.",1419984000,3,429,3.8863636363636362
6797978,3,B00PCZF3E6,"A serial killer is on the loose, picking up young gay Asian men, hustlers, and killing them in the most gruesome of ways. As far as the FBI knows, this is the third round of his killing spree having already left at least forty bodies in his wake. Agent Robbie Taylor is assigned to assist on the case due to his innate ability to get inside the mind of the killer. LAPD officer Dave Harris is the first on the scene of the first killing in his jurisdiction and soon meets the seemingly psychic FBI agent that shares a certain secret with him.

Over the duration of the film these two men are pawns in a game of cat and mouse with a very smart killer that always seems one step ahead of them. Once the killer figures out exactly who Robbie is and what he is capable of, Robbie becomes a target. In the end its Robbies refusal to be swayed by bullets and speeding cars along with his acute eye and paying attention to details that affords him the pleasure of stopping a killer. But what will happen between him and Dave once the case is solved?

This is a movie made from the book of the same name by Author GA Hauser. Admittedly, the book is always better than the movie. In this case though I think if you haven't read the book, the movie will not be as enjoyable for you. The details in the book of what the killer did, how the bodies were found, how Robbie used his talents to catch the killer, were so detailed and precise and that precision is lost in the movie. But if you have read the book then the movie is sort of a companion and you can look between the lines, you know in the back of your mind even though you don't see the body in the movie, you still rewind in your mind and remember the gory details from the book.

That being said, I think movies with a gay romance at the core are sought out by viewers and regardless of the written version of this story, the movie on its own will still be a great viewing experience for people. The acting is acceptable, not great but not terrible either, the sound and lighting in the movie was better than I expected being and indie film, and the core of the story is still there. How Robbie and Dave find each other through the most horrible of circumstance, but still accept their connection and explore the possibility of building a relationship outside of their jobs and this horrible case.",1419724800,2,2347,4.257847533632287
6797979,5,B00PCZF3E6,"G.A. Hauser did it again! This story is full of suspense, romance, sex, and is a great story. Well Written!",1419638400,2,107,4.4
6797980,1,B00PCZF3E6,"After seeing the 5 star reviews from others, Two Thumbs Up's review was a confirmation that I was not totally out of my mind. This was by far one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  It holds your interest only because you want to watch  it to see if it is ever going to get better. There is absolutely no comparison to Capital Games and to do so is a direct insult to  author. I hesitate to criticize the actors, because there is not much that you can do with a script this bad. GA Hauser, stick to writing, because this was deifinitely not good.",1418256000,8,554,4.111111111111111
6797981,5,B00PCZF3E6,As soon as I heard the movie was available to buy I was on Amazon getting my copy. This movie of her book was great and well worth the wait. As always GA Hauser brings to life great characters. It was very accurate of how I imaged it as I read her book which I love. So many times the movie is not as good as the book but this is not the case. The only thing I hate is that there will be no more. She is the queen of this genre and she will be missed.  This movie has a bit of everything. A hot romance and a demented serial killer what's not to love. I highly recommend this movie as well as her first movie Capital Games and of course her books.,1417046400,6,647,3.7925925925925927
6797982,5,B00PCZF3E6,"If you're going to do something right, you might as well do it yourself. This holds true here as author G.A. Hauser takes the reins as director of the second adaptation of one of her books. Naked Dragon is actually the first book I ever read by G.A. and I remember it well, so to see it on the screen holds a special place for me because she stays very, very close to the source material.

A serial killer is murdering Asian men at an alarming rate--one a night for twenty days before taking a break and starting over again in another city--and the local authorities haven't been able to track him down. Even the FBI is stumped. It's not until one of the Bureau agents--who also happens to have a psychic ability--meets one of the local officers that things really kick into action. Not only are they starting to make progress on finding the killer, but the two men begin a relationship that ignites a fire in each other.

Whereas the first adaptation of Hauser's book, Capital Games, was slick and polished, Naked Dragon is much grittier and that serves the story well. It helps, too, that the author is a former police officer, so everything you see the officers do in the film is how it would actually be done. The actors involved are very good and the production makes the most of its modest budget. What's a real shame is that Miss Hauser announced her retirement from writing and from making future films. This second phase of her career as director and producer is a glove she wears well and it would be a disappointment not to see her continue.",1416700800,6,1552,4.480565371024735
6797983,5,B00PCZF3E6,"Once again, G.A. Hauser has brought to life her wonderful characters in another great movie. And directed it too! Wonderful screen writing, bringing Naked Dragon to life.",1416096000,4,170,5.333333333333333
6797984,5,B00PCZF3E6,"This is GA's second movie based on her books and it is superb.  By the way, the movie takes place in Los Angeles  and not Seattle.  The movie depicts the  police searching for a horrible serial killer, dubbed the Dragon, who kills 20 Asian gay men, in a horrific manner, one each day, and then moves on to another city in another state.  The movie revolves around two major themes, a police procedural and a love story that develops between FBI Agent Robbie Taylor and a police officer, Dave Harris,  who discovers several of the bodies.  The love story is bi-racial and very convincing.  There is some nudity during a few sexual scenes but the emphasis in the film is finding the killer.  Robbie has some psychic abilities which helps him track the killer but the killer becomes aware of this and tries to kill Robbie.  All of the actors, but especially the ones portraying Robbie and Dave are truly professional.  The love story is hot, and the hunt for the killer is very suspenseful.  The quality of the video graphics is excellent, although the sound is a bit rough around the edges but not enough to detract from the enjoyment of this terrific film.  You owe it to yourself to obtain and view this thoroughly entertaining film.  So buy it, watch it and enjoy it.",1416009600,22,1268,4.553097345132743
6797985,5,B00PCZF3E6,"Producer/Director/Author GA Hauser has done it again with her incredible movie adaptation of her book ""Naked Dragon"". What is not to love about this thrilling story of a crime spree in Los Angeles, Ca. Young Asian men are being systematically wiped out as they become victims of a horrendous serial killer and the LAPD is stumped until FBI agent Robbie Taylor is brought in to consult on the case. At first, the LAPD is surprised that the FBI has a psychic on the case but when SA Robbie begins pointing them to clues in the crime, everyone including rookie cop, Dave Harris is blown away when they begin missing the killer only moments after the crimes are committed. As the story unfolds, Dave Harris, a deeply closeted cop, afraid his career will be in jeopardy if his sexuality is exposed, finds himself inexplicably drawn to the handsome psychic, unable to resist when Robbie asks him over to his place. The two initiate a torrid love affair, burning up the sheets as the killer becomes more and more bold, preying on victims right underneath their noses. Will Robbie and Dave be able to hide their interest not only in solving the crime, but in each other? Will they fall victim to the illusive serial killer themselves?

Ms. Hauser has done with this film, what she did with Capital Games. She has created a happily ever after ending for a gay movie that is so desperately needed among gay film choices. Wonderfully directed and brilliantly acted, this movie was a testament to fine film making. I for one, look forward to the next movie adaptation of one of her 113 wonderful MM novels with eager anticipation.",1415923200,10,1618,4.697183098591549
6797986,2,B00PCZF3E6,"Former female Seattle police officer and now author, (and director) Ms. G.A. Hauser, spins out another film production (saw her 'Capital Games') with mixed success. The premise and story, theoretically at least, are quite interesting. The script and some scenes lack credulity, especially in the elements and rigor of what one would hope law enforcement personnel and processes would follow, i.e., scrupulous detail, but we know that doesn't always follow. The relationship between the white FBI psychic and the black LAPD officer, (true fantasy, right?), is acted and scripted pretty well. However, given the LAPD's infamous racist rep, it would have been a kick to have the ethnicities reversed. The other actors are a bit square and stiff. (Shout-out to Shane Keough, FBI agent in this film, former BRAVO T.V. cast member of the RHW of the OC--Gena Keough's son, the jock, now actor). Overall, just a lot more action, crackle and edginess needed to make this work. Better editing could have added to the crispness and suspense, but it drags. We've all had a heavy dose of superbly crafted television crime serials and movies and this film, relative to those, is truly lacking.",1523491200,,1179,5.082474226804123
6797987,2,B00PCZF3E6,"Acting is okay but the storyline is not great. Hard to follow the narrative in certain parts and doesn't flow as a whole. No continuity.

Lacking in character development as well. Chemistry is okay but you don't get to know them enough to care about them or their relationship. That's what is supposed to keep an audiences attention.",1523059200,,333,4.741379310344827

The acting, audio, direction vary from okay to OMG throughout the movie that is what makes this movie enjoyable.  A serial killer is targeting young Asian men and it is up to the 'psychic' FBI agent to solve this case.  Along the way it is discovered that Officer Dave Harris has the strongest stomach and gets assigned to these crime scenes and there is mutual attraction between them.  I don't want to spoil to plot but if you love a good 'bad' (i.e. terrible) movie watch this one or Capital Games!",1496534400,,583,4.686274509803922

6797995,2,B00PCZF3E6,"I've had this movie awhile, just never got around to watching it until now. The plot of a serial killer targeting gay men and the cop and the FBI/psychic guy could have been interesting. Unfortunately, ""Naked Dragon"" suffers from a bad case of what I call 'film school' mentality. Meaning it shows a lack of coherent direction, aka it's all over the place. In addition, the sound was horrible, the lighting dark and the cinematography awful. I really expected more as the production effects of G.A. Hauer's last movie, ""Capital Games"" was superb. (Rent that movie). Perhaps if the two lead actors had any chemistry this might have been okay; but I suggest saving your money and renting/buying something else in the gay-themed movie category.",1468886400,,741,4.936

6797997,1,B00PCZF3E6,"Those who have raved over this movie must have seen a different one than I did. Two intersecting stories - one about a hunt for a serial killer and the other a gay romance between an LA cop and a supposed FBI psychic - were both amateurish and not even remotely credible. The FBI agents wander around LA like the walking dead and keep taking coffee breaks in the midst of investigating a number of murders, thereby leaving one of their fellow agents in danger. Gun shots from nowhere keep threatening our investigators who are able to ""sniff"" out the whereabouts of our serial killer in no time flat despite the fact that the scene of all this action takes place in one of the heaviest populated areas in this country. The gay part of this film appears to be based upon the idea that gratuitous male nudity and simulated sexual activity will be a draw for a huge audience. Talk about ""love at first fright"" - whoops, I meant ""sight"". A supposedly psychic FBI agent
who later admits that he really isn't psychic makes contact with a hunky black policeman at the outset of investigating a murder attributed to a serial killer who has moved on from Seattle to LA. And before you can say West Hollywood, the two are in bed together doing the nasty even though the cop claims that he is a novice. Despite his best efforts, it seems that everyone finds out that the cop is gay except for his immediate boss and partner. I expected the FBI agent and the cop to appear on The Tonight Show at any moment to confess their new found love. The murderer is revealed very early on for those who are ""psychic"" or just pay close attention (or not) to the story. With a known serial killer on the loose with more than 40 known killings to his credit, we can only wonder at the fact that we have one police car showing up at the scene of a crime who just happens to be our favorite cop and a junior officer at that. This film gives new meaning to the
term ""man hunt"".  To add some ""horror"" to our story, the dead are always found in a decomposed state requiring men in special garb to come and clean up the mess.  When the bodies are discovered, everyone recoils and holds his nose. Ironically, I did the same during the greater part of this movie.  This was a major disappointment on both its levels, especially after seeing the same director's Capital Games
only a few days earlier.",1461801600,4,2366,4.38496583143508

6798020,5,B00PCZF3E6,"Just finished watching ""Naked Dragon"" released by The G.A. Hauser Collection.
For those who came in late; G.A. Hauser is a former Seatle Police Officer and one of the premier Gay Romance Fiction Writers in America [ over 100 novels]  and across the Pond over in England where she lives.  In fair disclosure, I am friends with G.A. Hauser here on Facebook, even though I've never had the opportunity - as of yet - to meet her.
""Naked Dragon"" is G.A. Hauser's second movie that she has directed, and it's based on her novel by the same title. [One I haven't read yet. - Sorry G.A.]
""Naked Dragon' is an intense crime drama that captures the view with the unfolding manhunt for a serial killer; known as the Dragon, who preys on young gay Asian men and butchers them in horrific ways.
Spoiler Alert - There a are few graphic scenes which shows a crime scene in bloody detail and may not be for the faint hearted.
Dave Harris is a rookie Los Angeles Police Officer who is inadventenly drawn into the FBI manhunt for the Dragon when his calmness and level headedness impress the FBI agents assigned to track down the Dragon.
Harris catches the attention of Agent Robbie Taylor, an agency psychic, in more ways then one.  Though Taylor knows that Harris is attacted to men - Taylor didn't know that Harris had no bedroom experience.  In the movie, Taylor's psychic abilities are more observational based then esp, i.e. mental telethapy - but its hinted that the Dragon is playing a cat-and-mouse game with Taylor because his powers are greater.
The romance between Taylor and Harris is intense and realistic; and it may not have a future - now that would be a Spoiler if I revealed the ending - if Harris can't work through a few realsitic issues.
SPOILER ALERT - A few naked bedroom scenes.
I'm looking forward to G.A.'s next movie adaptation.
STRONGLY RECOMMENDED!

It probably could have used some more staffing on the police force when guarding the crime scenes and gawkers  to make it more realistic but all in all I enjoyed the movie.

No druggies.....It was a positive story, and the portrayal of the black male character was nonracist (which is rare for gay films). Kudos. I just discovered G.A. Hauser. I am going to look at more of her works.",1528156800,3,477,4.494252873563219
8687614,5,B00PCZF3E6,"G. A. Hauser is awesome. It makes movies that has meaning or someone has been affected in some kind of way. The acting was good, the storyline was good, and since it's based on a true story that just means more to me as a movie watcher. To lead characters were very sexy in their delivery. And I enjoy the scenes that they did together especially when they were more involved with each other. Shot nicely. Good job cast and directors",1527811200,,433,4.3580246913580245

8687616,5,B00PCZF3E6,"I enjoyed this movie. I thought it had a good story line.  Yes there could have been more details.  To those that criticize the movie and the quality- feel free to pony up the money for production cost.  But over all a good movie.  The characters were interesting and did a good job acting.  The description says it has gay characters so it shouldn't surprise anyone.  There was a lot of skin, but handled well and was not any different than straight cop movies.  I think the coffee breaks just played into the stereotype of some police officers.
The other movie by this writer was also very good.  Capital Games.",1525651200,3,613,4.509090909090909
