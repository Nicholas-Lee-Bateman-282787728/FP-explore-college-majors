8390380,1,B00377ISCA,This show's intro music is off key and atrocious. The animation is poor and overall the show is annoying. It is a 3 minute show so get used to constantly hearing that awful song.,1446595200,2,178,4.264705882352941

I knew I could always play it on our computer until I get a region free player. It was exactly as advertised with a menu that let's you switch to English.,1411344000,,313,4.216666666666667
