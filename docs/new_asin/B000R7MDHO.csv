2861101,5,B000R7MDHO,I am not LDS but I've always loved this film. I bought this for my mom and she loves it. It arrived faster than I expected. I'm happy with my purchase.,1360713600,10,151,3.903225806451613
2861102,5,B000R7MDHO,"This is a great family movie. Obviously about Jesus, this movie starts by showing a family in South America as Myan Indians. It has a little love story where a young man falls in love with a lady who believes that Jesus will come some day. Throughout the movie there are many good life lessons that can be learned. For the price, you absolutely cant fail. Ive shown this movie in the United States and to friends in Spanish in Argentina. Ive never seen this movie without tears falling from myself and the guests who watched this with me. A++

P.S. This movie is also broken up into parts on YouTube. I wanna say 7 parts? Dont quote me on this, I didn't upload them...",1343520000,,668,4.344

2861104,4,B000R7MDHO,"This short film is produced by the LDS church and directed by award winning Kieth Merrill. Shot on the Island of Kauai, the film is beautifully shot. Even more than that though, it has a beautiful story as well. The film is based on 3rd Nephi from the Book of Mormon. A great look into what the Book of Mormon is really about.",1329868800,5,326,4.190476190476191
2861105,5,B000R7MDHO,"Thank you to the Church of Jesus Christ of Later-Day Saints for making this movie.  I believe Lord Jesus had a ministry on other continents during His time on earth.  I recommend getting this movie, praying about it beforehand, and listening to your heart to see what you believe.  I have been truly helped and edified by the LDS church.",1318809600,11,337,4.583333333333333

8199300,5,B000R7MDHO,"I truly believe Jesus Christ has control over Movies like this. He allowed it to be created in such excellence which is guaranteed to captivate ANY watcher of the film. With that said, I know Joseph Smith made many mistakes like us all. However this Book of Mormon and this Movie have absolutely nothing to do with Joseph Smith. What Im saying is this is obviously a MIGHTY GOD AT WORK! Movie makes the Holy Spirit hit anybody who watches. Cant deny the Book of Mormon ever anymore. I just cant. Jesus allowed this movie to be created...thats proof enough. A well scripted and acted movie is much more powerful than a book we all know that. 5 stars.",1364688000,7,649,4.46218487394958
