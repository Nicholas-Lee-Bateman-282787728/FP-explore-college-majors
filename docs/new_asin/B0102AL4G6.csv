7304730,5,B0102AL4G6,"Needless to say, the video quality of the BluRay disks is stunning. As expected, the animation is first-rate, and leaves little to be desired visually. Brilliant colours and production design make the viewing experience a real pleasure.

Unlike the OST CD's,the sound quality of both the DVD and BluRay disks is excellent, with plenty of acoustic headroom for louder passages without clipping or distortion. The mix between the background music and dialogue is well done. A good sound system is a must for full enjoyment of these discs. Both the English and Japanese soundtracks are excellent - you'll likely want to watch both versions.

Although the English and Japanese VA's (voice actors) are different people, the voices are well matched, so that either version is quite believable. Listening to the English language sound track while watching the English subtitles shows that there is some difference between the translations and the spoken VA words. Nevertheless, the English sound track is very logical, even though there are some occasional word substitutions from the Japanese.

All in all, this production is well done, and leaves the viewer wishing for another season. You will watch this more than once!",1456790400,9,1216,5.225641025641026

7304745,5,B0102AL4G6,"I was so excited to get this!! Everything was in the box as explained, perfect condition, basically perfect! Absolutely no complaints. The character cards were bigger then exspected, towel may be small but is a pretty good size. The art book has such beautiful art of the boys in it. My box and my DVDs cover was a little dirty even though it was brand new in the wrapper but a little rubbing alcohol clean it right up so that was not a issue at all. If you love anime and the Free! Seasons this is a must have for your collection!!",1464825600,2,532,4.2254901960784315

7304747,4,B0102AL4G6,"The water effect on the cover is beautifully done. I love the 3D effect it gives off. My only complaint is the fact that there were some black smudges on my case. However, I was able to remove the smudges with a little bit of rubbing alcohol. So, that was good. :)

This anime is probably one of the most heart warming slice of life animes out there. The situations are pretty realistic in this anime, and the struggles the characters go through speaks very clearly to me as a student. The struggles of figuring out what you want to do in the future is a daunting and frustrating task. I feel like every high school graduate should watch this anime to be inspired. XD It's okay to not know what you want to do in the future. It is more of the journey sometimes rather than the end goal. Just take the opportunities presented before you and who knows, perhaps you will find your dream. Haru definitely did. ^_^",1459987200,3,909,4.347058823529411

2 stickers (iwatobi logo & samezuka logo)
1 small towel (with a silhouette image of the boys)
several character cards that are high quality in both image and cardstock
1 artbook featuring all the end card photos and several bonus photos
2 DVD boxes (each has 2 discs in it).
^ the boxes feature additional artwork front and back of different pairings of the boys and the DVDs inside are holographic with each boy being on one that is colored to their character color.

7304768,5,B0102AL4G6,"Truthfully, I purchased this outside of Amazon - but I feel it's worth noting: the towel is small, like a hand towel you might put next to the bathroom sink. I wasn't aware of this until I received it, I was expecting a larger bath towel size - a minor disappointment, but fans of the show will still love the entire package!",1456963200,4,325,4.258064516129032
7304769,5,B0102AL4G6,"This is only a partial review, since I haven't watched this home release edition yet, but I just wanted to give a heads-up: the artbox for my copy was very dirty.  It had black smudges all over, like someone put it in a box with a black crayon and shook it, before taking it out and putting it in shrink-wrap.  Fortunately, I was able to clean it gently with a cotton swab and a little rubbing alcohol, and now it's fine!  Just wanted to say that in case anyone else had the same issue.  (I've attached a before-and-after picture)

The only neg I have for the boxset contents are that the illustrations on the Blu-ray covers seem a little...fuzzy.  Like what an older color printer would put out.  They're pretty pictures, but I would have preferred a crisper look.",1456876800,12,765,4.460431654676259

8721261,4,B0102AL4G6,"Free! Eternal Summer is a fun romp. Set in modern Japan (Natch!) the story follows a four-member high school swim club including all the teen drama and enthusiasm for competitive swimming. These four match the usual Japanese stereotypes, one is a great athlete, likable but not driven; another is a great athlete but a nerd; another is a great athlete but apathetic, and the last is a blond-haired wide-eyed little ball of energy who is always yelling encouragement to the other three. All are muscular and wearing skin-tight swimwear. Each one of the characters offer opportunities to purchase posters and pin-ups for your wall of the boys in sexy poses. ( I'm not sexy, I'm just drawn that way.)
There are no parents in sight to muddle-up the action. Each time to boys are in crisis, they turn to their teammates for support, advice or help. When the smallest one, Nagisa, runs away from home because of poor grades he sleeps over one of his teammates home. All three teammates come to have a heart-to-heart but each are too polite to squeeze the little tyke for answers. They have to gang-up on him to get Nagisa to fess-up. He explains his academic failure and the problems he now has with his unseen parents. They all console him and offer after school help. When he then tells them he may have to quit the swim team, they are horrified. All four lose their minds and go on the lam. The swim club hides overnight in a closed swimming pool building, fearing capture by Nagisa's mother. They are not discovered by the ogre of a mother, but by a school adviser who speaks firm but politely that Nagisa must go home and face the music.  THAT'S IT!  It's all very Disney Channel drama.
Everyone on the team eats, sleeps and obsesses over swimming and the team. Even those who are facing graduation are more concerned with leaving the competition to others than their future. 'Should I go freestyle or relay?' None have girlfriends, none really have job aspirations. The plots offer light fare and little real drama. No real bullying or drug use here in idyllic Japan! One of the boys are hard to tell apart, so Haru has purple hair and shark teeth, Nagisa has blond hair and real round eyes because, you know, Manga!
The review lost a star because of the price. Too high for what comes in the box. This printing has no towel or extras but is a very pricey $43.00 at time of purchase.",1497225600,2,2383,4.565420560747664
8721262,5,B0102AL4G6,"Any Free! fangirl must have. It comes in a cute box with all of the boys on it, art cards of each boy individually, and an art book with so many cute photos of the boys together. Also comes with a cute little sports towel that you can use for your tears of joy when you watch the dvd/blu ray",1496707200,2,291,3.8666666666666667

8721266,5,B0102AL4G6,"The valedictory season of FREE! finds our high school athletes facing their greatest challenge yet: life after graduation. Their final months as a team, advancing to the nationals, are fraught with the usual drama, but there are new characters, several awkward situations, and all the lithe swimmers' bodies you can stand to admire. Perfect.

If the Husker Du lyric, ""I summer where I winter at, and no one is allowed there"" seems tailor made for Haruka, it's perversely satisfying to see this fish out of water in some episodes, especially in the laugh out loud OVA, ""Forbidden All Hard!"" I miss this series already.",1483833600,2,617,4.9326923076923075
