With this set not only do u get a great Stephen King story but u also get Wolf, Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer,  and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, not ever saw yet, but u get 3 great movies at a low price.  I always look for a cheap buy when it comes to my movie collection and I also highly recommend these movies for any horror movie fan/collector. These also have great sound and picture quality. Pick this awesome set up for your collection,  you'll definitely be happy that u did",1520985600,,590,4.537735849056604
