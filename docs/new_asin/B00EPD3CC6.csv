5932466,5,B00EPD3CC6,This doc. Shows how kids are used as endentured servants. They are not STUDENT ATHLETES. My blood boils for these kids. I can hope and pray that that O bannon lawsuit is the end of the plantation cropping of our kids!,1390953600,,217,4.317073170731708
5932467,1,B00EPD3CC6,This documentary is put together to represent the views of just a few with extreme views who only tell half the story and conviently avoid the realities of college athletics to benefit their story telling. There are countless individuals avaialble to tell the other half of the story. Apparently the director of this film was not interested in fully examining the topic at hand.,1390694400,3,378,4.921875

5932470,5,B00EPD3CC6,"I enjoy documentaries such as this one; informative, interesting, and put together well.

The arguments it makes are excellent and it is definitely pushing an agenda that some may disagree with, however, there is only one compelling argument against the one being made and that is Title 9. This goes to the point of the documentary that rules can be changed by those who are making it though.

The interviews, sound clips and historical background are all to the benefit of the viewer and the points being made. The only negative I would note is that some background knowledge is necessary to understand fully but not necessary understand the problems.",1389916800,2,652,4.918181818181818
5932471,5,B00EPD3CC6,A edgy look at the truth of college sports and universities desire for your dollar. Player's are viewed as commodities and are thrown away if they don't follow the plan set forth by the university. This documentary should be shown to every person who has an interest in college athletics. I think you will look at your local university differently.,1387670400,5,348,4.816666666666666
5932472,5,B00EPD3CC6,"This is an outstanding film, based on an even more outstanding work by Taylor Branch.  It discusses the history, and current status, of ""student-athletes"" within the NCAA structure at major football and basketball colleges in the US.  Some reviewers argue that the film calls for paying ""amateur"" college athletes, but while this idea is voiced, in fact the film simply points out the inequities that exist and calls for  starters for doing what can be done without causing too much immediate disruption -- giving ""student-athletes"" a voice amongst all the other vested interests in the NCAA committee structures.

Before one dismisses the film as biased or unbalanced against the status quo, it should be noted that In his memoirs written in 1995 (""Unsportsmanlike Conduct:  Exploiting College Athletes,"" University of Michigan Press), Walter Byers, the founding executive director and decades-long iron fist behind the NCAA, convincingly argued for some, if not all, of the potential remedies addressed in the film.

Whether or not one agrees with the film's premise that something is wrong with economics behind high-level college sports, the film deserves a look.  It provides an interesting historical look at the development of college ""amateur"" sports, and pulls together various important voices on all sides of the issue.  Sadly, the NCAA leadership did not wish to include itself amongst these voices.

I will leave my comments brief, and note that one can easily find any number of on-line reviews published by many of the leading newspapers.",1381881600,15,1553,5.280487804878049
5932473,4,B00EPD3CC6,Interesting analysis of ncaa sports. The history and growth of the ncaa was informative but the documentary is biased and appears to manipulate statistics to support a single theme. It is worth watching but important to remember that revenues from football and basketball help finance a plethora of other ncaa sports that do not benefit from the same economic return.,1470873600,,367,5.133333333333334

5932481,4,B00EPD3CC6,"An unsettling reminder of the completely predictable, Kafkaesque absurdities that arise when highly lucrative sports are attached to higher education for over a century, the athletes themselves receive no remuneration (unless lucky enough to become professionals out of school) and an increasingly powerful entity (NCAA) is self-appointed with perpetuating that arrangement. Unfortunately, the absurdities must pile up.

Tayler Branch is in fighting form, transitioning from a Pulitzer Prize winning civil rights historian to a labor crusader, teasing out those absurdities when set starkly against any other normal market/labor arrangement. The NCAA's long-standing Executive Director William Byers is an openly heartless, calculating villain conjuring up the legally bullet-proof fiction of ""student athlete"" which not only avoids pesky costs but reliably absolves schools of any liabilities when athletes are invariably injured. The only thing missing is a white cat for Bryers to stroke. Sonny Vaccarro, a marketing executive, cleverly and perfectly legally, exploits the absurd rules allowing the coaches everything and the players nothing commercial, and he introduces 6 and later 7 figure product endorsements to the coaches. Sonny and his client NIKE are simply doing their jobs and ahead of everyone else. No, the problem is arrangment in the first and long place.

This otherwise fine documentary could have benefitted from a bit more historic context, such as the 1929 23rd Carnegie Institute Bulletin and the Harvard Crimson's comments in 1932 on the report ([...])

""The truth is that trying to keep college football pure and undefiled, and at the same time make it pay large sums into the college treasury, is very much like the effort to enforce the Volstead Act--it runs counter to the qualities of human nature. When the football player sees his college gather in a million dollars in one year in gate receipts and considers how hard he has been worked to achieve that result, he is strongly inclined to feel that he is entitled to some of the swag.""

Haven't the 18th and 21st Amendments taught us something about fighting human nature and depriving us of swag?",1467331200,,2179,5.362573099415204

5932483,5,B00EPD3CC6,"Excellent documentary in every respect.  It has always sickened me that colleges profit from their student athletes who are essentially indentured servants.  It is even more sickening that black teenagers are the primary victims of the fraud perpetrated by NCAA.  It said it all when one of the NCAA reps said ""you can't let the animals run the zoo"".  99% of these students never get to the Pros and many of them sustain serious injuries while playing high school and college sports that will effect them for the rest of their lives (see ""The League of Denial"" on that issue).

5932484,4,B00EPD3CC6,"Very informative and a global approach to the issue. As with most documentaries, it is a bit biased.  The value of the scholarship exceeds the value of most jobs that high school graduates obtain.

The stories of  unfortunate athletes, representing untold thousands who fell by the wayside to be ground up and spit out of this system, are heartbreaking. The film also exposes the patent hypocrisy of NCAA hierarchy who blindly deny the massive influence of big money,  overwhelming pressure to win (usually at most any cost), and the exploitation of young, poor,  and unsophisticated (predominately black) men.",1433116800,,651,5.271844660194175

5932507,5,B00EPD3CC6,"Good discussion of the impact of big-time college revenue sports on the ""student athletes"" who all too often aren't really students as much as semi-pro athletes and the challenges facing the universities to try to keep the athletes academically eligible to play the sport.  The documentary showed the University of North Carolina but did not focus on the major academic scandal involving athletes and ""paper courses"" devised to raise the quality point average of the players enabling the star players to remain eligible to play in the game and which resulted in ruining reputations, loss of jobs and a continuing embarrassment years later for a quality academic institution with a history of championship college men's and women's basketball.  Well done documentary that did discuss the coining of the term ""student athlete"" and the reason that the NCAA devised this label and became ""the"" authority over college athletics.  I would have liked the film to at least touch on other options for correction of the problem rather than focusing on just paying the athletes, which many of the players want in return for their service and the revenue they bring to the schools.

As a fan of big-time college football and someone whose career was in academe, I would like to see individuals who are promising professional athletes have a way to enter the NFL and NBA drafts without the farce of being admitted to a major university and playing for the scholarship but often without the desire or ability to do collegiate work.  The documentary did point out that it is theoretically possible for an athlete to go directly into the NBA out of high school and to be able to play on a farm-team of a major baseball club but very few athletes are able to do this---Koby Bryant is an example of an athlete who went from high school directly to the NBA but he was an exceptional athlete and evidently did not require several years of coaching prior to being drafted into pro ball.  The NCAA needs to require and enforce requirements that all athletes actually have the ability to meet admission standards and to be given the time to study so that the athlete could receive a quality education in return for playing his or her sport.  All schools abiding by the same rules without cheating would result in a more level playing field and the games would still be exciting to the millions of college sports fans.  Alumni are still going to support their school's teams and still donate money to their alma maters.  High school football and basketball games are exciting to watch and are not corrupted by some well-financed schools being able to have an advantage over other programs.  Before television and product endorsement contracts brought in billions of dollars to the colleges and universities for their coaching staffs and athletic programs I don't think there was as much pressure on the schools to come up with creative and dishonest ways to keep some athletes eligible to play.  The revenue sports, in particular men's basketball and football, support and make possible all of the other sports on the campus.  It was pointed out that the vast percentage of college athletes are not drafted to play at the next level and are left with little to show for their contributions.",1428192000,,3266,4.85431654676259

5932510,4,B00EPD3CC6,"I knew that before I saw Schooled: The Price Of College Sports. When I watched it, I didn't learn anything new. Truth be told, I hadn't watched college football for 10 years now and college basketball for over 20 years because I knew NCAA was corrupt. When the highest paid university employee had been either the football or basketball coach, there was something seriously wrong with the picture.

Obviously, it's slavery, and it's wrong. The simple solution for the players is not to play yet they persist. The simple solution for the fans is not to watch yet they persist. The simple solution for the Congress is to put a ban on sports in universities and force the creation of an independent sport league (think of the farm system in MLB), taking away control from the universities, yet they do nothing about it. Why? They are being paid through lobby groups to stand down. Athletes, the majority of them, just don't belong in school. If they prove that they are academically capable of doing the work at a college level, then it's fine with me that they attend school. But sports have no place in universities. Treat both as independent organizations. Obviously the smaller sports suffer for it, but who cares? Most of them are cheating through PEDs.

I am totally against the idea of colleges paying athletes to play because of one simple reason: the students and the taxpayers will have to pay for it. Oh, you didn't know that? That's because more than half of the spectators don't attend college or don't have a college degree. Currently, those who attend these schools actually have to pay a fee per semester to them in order to cover the budget allocated for sports. If the idea of paying athletes takes effect, the students have to pay more out of their pockets. If they aren't being charged for it, it's the taxpayers. It's a lose-lose situation.

Let me ask you something important: what percent of the nation watch college sports? It's no more than 1%. For the national championship, it's somewhere around 5 to 10%. In other words, on any given day, 99% of the nation don't watch college sports with 90 to 95% of them on a national championship day of football or basketball. That means: NO ONE CARES.

Sports represent everything that's fundamentally wrong about what an university is supposed to be all about. It's a place for students to get an education and training to prepare for work. The students shell out $10,000 to $30,000 annually for the privilege. They have to work hard and prove that they academically belong in college. On the other hand, athletes get free room, board, tuition, tutoring services, and other perks including sex and drugs while attending school. Their academic performance, before or after, isn't significant. Most of them can't read or write above 3rd or 4th grade level and obviously do not belong in college. But who cares? They, as slaves, make money for the school.

All in all, money is the root of all evil.",1425513600,,2961,4.741747572815534

5932515,3,B00EPD3CC6,"I don't feel sorry for students who choose to play sports and get a free education, free housing, free books etc. when you consider the cost of these things, they are well paid for rarely finishing college. If they are to be paid at all, then pay them as student workers with the same limits on work times and pay as other student workers who don't get the massive perks and leeway that football players get. Playing football is a choice. It's also a choice that is closed to women and others. They may have come from disadvantaged backgrounds, but a free education and the connections and prestige that come with playing college level athletics are just the beginning of the good that comes from their hardwork and dedication. I do think the athletics department takes advantage and makes ridiculous money on the backs of these students. The athletics department doesn't even contribute to the actual university and often is considered a separate entity. This doesn't justify giving these students even more of a free ride when we have academic students working multiple jobs and eating only what is handed out for free at local grocers just to get by. The universities should demand a cut of the proceeds (or a greater cut in the few cases where they receive a pittance from the AD) and cap salaries for these ridiculous blowhards that do not contribute to higher education.

5932550,2,B00EPD3CC6,"We've been down this road before.  Pay athletes.  Yeah.  Been there, done that.  This movie is based on the book ""Cartel"" that openly questions the insidious nature of the NCAA and advocates for paying the downtrodden athletes in light of the evil colleges that are using slave labor to grease their pockets.  However, along the journey of the book and the two hours traffic of the movie...there are a number of problems with this stance.

#1 - The movie and book offer absolutely ZERO ideas for how to accomplish this.  At one point, the illustrious former collegate athlete and now basketball analyst Jay Billas offers up the following tidbit...loosely quoted: ""people say that how are you going to do this?  How are you going to pay the athletes?  What levels of college?  What sports?  All players?  Just the stars?  These are questions that people ask.  Well, there are people making a lot of money solving problems.  That should not be the reason why we don't do it.""

Thanks Jay.  You have NO CLUE HOW TO DO IT and you say that someone should be able to come up with a plan!  Idiotic!

#2 - It IS an issue, contrary to Mr. Billas as to how and who do you pay?  There's this little thing called Title IX that the producers of the movie and book leave out.  Whatever the men's sports get, so do the women.  So if Jameis Winston gets $5,000 extra a year, then the backup middle setter for the volleyball team must get that cash as well.  To not do so would be to undo that piece of legislation and send us careening down the slope of more litigation and murky waters.

How do you pay Winston $5,000 and a walk on who makes the team the same?  Or a back up lacrosse player?  do you create a wage scale based on playing time and incentives?

Contrary to the film, many universities do not generate ridiculous sums of money.  The conference and bowl affiliations help to get the Illinios, Northwesterns, Vanderbilts and Wake Forests of the world out of the woods.  Those schools do not have the ability to throw on top of their budgets, an outlay of that kind if coin.

There are over 80,000 football players alone in the NCAA.  at $5,000 a pop, you are talking about $400 million just for football.  Roughly $350,000 per school.  But again...this is just football.  That is a ton of coin and the reality is that the bottom level schools who are not elite can't compete with the schools that have the coin.

The producers of the film are SOLELY concentrated on football and basketball.  These are actually the only two revenue generating sports for the vast majority of schools.  The movie and the book fail to point out that the revenue from these sports does not go into greasy pockets, but rather it funds the other sports on campus...namely the female programs that by law, must be in place.  Women's field hockey at Wisconsin is not a cash cow.  It is the football program that helps generate the scholarships to bring young ladies into that program year after year.

The football revenue also funds the overall campus.  It increases applications for the school.  A great book about Northwestern mentions a more than 300% uptick in applications after they went to the Rose Bowl and similar numbers occurred at Wisconsin.  Revenue also helps build science wings and communication buildings.  They also serve as the hub for most of the communications degrees at the schools with radio and tv broadcasts.

#3 - The evil NCAA did a great deal to clean up much of the mess and nonsense that was going on in the 60s, 70s and 80s with players getting paid for no-show jobs, and boosters paying off players left and right.  Arian Foster's story about people giving him money was commonplace then and it upset the competitive balance.  With more money flowing into the system, MORE transgressions and illegal activity would take place.  The movie cites Foster getting paid and Reggie Bush getting paid as POSITIVES supporting their cause!  See?  It's already being done by some lowlifes taking advantage of the system and cheating, why not make it that way for everyone?  Reggie Bush wasn't hard up.  His mother got a sweet house virtually rent free and he drove around town in a beautiful classic car because he thought he deserved it.  He thought he was privileged.  It wasn't because he felt some angst toward the NCAA.  He was greedy and wanted to get paid.  They took his Heisman away.

#4 - The value of a college education over four years is $240,000.  Much more in some of the elite institutions.  If you want to get that kind of an investment as a 19 year old, let me know.  The producers of this film poo poo the college education because the students that wanted no part of it, like the punks at UNC or other places don't get anything out of it...as if they were searching for something in the first place.  THOUSANDS of stories about players TRULY getting out of the ghetto and being the first to graduate from college in their family because of the scholarship that they got.  Many players that this film moans and whines and pines about are the same players that would Never have gotten into the school that they got into in the first place were it not for the scholarship to pay as well as the lowering of the academic bar to let them into the school in the first place.  You have to be a top 5% student in high school to even sniff North Carolina at Chapel Hill if you are out of state.  Top notch SAT scores to boot.  Yet UNC and other NCAA schools allow a minimum SAT and GPA score to allow student athletes the ability to enter into a school that they had NO BUSINESS and NO FINANCIAL MEANS TO PAY FOR the ability to get into that school.  And now...this film and these people want to get paid.

Obnoxious.
Short sighted.
Delusional.

It is the absolute EASIEST thing in the world to argue for paying college athletes.  But instituting such a system is a fool's errand.

This film offered no insights into a solution whatsoever.  it highlights a few cases of abuse in the system...a successful NFL player who is currently making MILLIONS of dollars  BECAUSE of his being able to showcase his ability at the University of Tennessee.  And I apologize here while I am wrapping up, but Arian Foster!  you have got to be kidding me!

Here's a guy who is VERY much an intellectual.  He is a smart guy who used his scholarship to pursue his education.  He is a poet and a literary guy.  There is NO way anyone can argue that Arian Foster put butts in the seats in Tennessee.  Rocky Top was there before and it will be there when he is gone.  He had fumble issues and work ethic problems.  Were he on salary, he would have had his salary cut or he would have been fired.  FIRED!  The movie argues about 4-year guaranteed scholarships!  Seriously!?  I coached at a DII school where a scholarship player came into camp at 360 pounds.  20 pounds heavier than when he was recruited. During the season, he gained 10 more pounds.  In the spring another 10.  At 380, he was told that if he wasn't back down to his playing weight of 360 (which was 20 pounds more than it should have been) his scholarship would be pulled.  He came into the fall at 400 pounds.  The producers of this film argue that his college should be paid for for four years for the revenue that he is generating for the college...up in his dorm room...with pizzas...never touching the field...skipping mandatory study halls... flunking out of school.

Pathetic.

8607895,5,B00EPD3CC6,"I watched this documentary last night, it was very informative as to the situation with student-athletes, especially in men's football and basketball.  Most of them are at university to play their sports, any education is a secondary concern.  The issue ins't really with paying the athletes, it's that they shouldn't be at university to begin with, but there is no other way they can pursue their passion without attending.

My daughter is on a full academic scholarship at a NCAA D2 university.  She also works a campus job to defray costs.  She has the freedom to take  summer jobs, with no risk to her scholarship.  All of these are denied to those on athletic scholarships.

The solution as I see is two-fold:

1) The NFL and NBA should set up farm systems similar to the NHL and MLB.  This way, athletes whose passion is their sport won't have to go through the pretense of going to college to do what they love.  This system works fine for the NHL and MLB.

2)  Athletes would still have the option of taking athletic scholarship, providing the can meet the same academic standards as the rest of student body.  Practice time would be limited to the same amount as with a campus job (10 hours a week in the case of my daughter).  This would allow them to actually study.  Athletes would be paid the same hourly rate as a campus job.  Athletes would be free to take summer jobs, etc., as it's none of the college's business.

3) Finally no college should be able to use an athlete's likeness for profit (e.e, EA Sports video games), without compensation.
