8496626,1,B001EN5I5Y,I have a two year old niece that is bonkers about robots. She loves the Little Robots movies as well as Robots. I thought this would be a cute addition to her collection. I sat down with her to watch this...don't bother. The computer graphics are horrible. I felt like I was watching a bad video game from the 80's. I would rate it up there with Pacman. It was a huge disappointment and we couldn't get through more than 10 to 15 minutes of it!,1298851200,3,444,4.174418604651163
