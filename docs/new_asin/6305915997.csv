7899075,4,6305915997,"This is more a snapshot of one of America's greatest icons during his real life than it is a narrated documentary.  The film is a compendium of homemovies that showcase Cash as an entertainer and as a man.  Predictably, Johnny is accessible and friendly to just about everybody and you see that while he's ""adjusted well to prosperity,"" he's still an honest country man inside.

This is also a ninety minute performance video.  Most of its segments include some kind of singing or impromtu recital.  We see Johnny playing at country fairs and at a prison (not Fulsom).

What pleased me the most about this film was the inclusion of Cash's duets with Bob Dylan.  Watching the two of them record together was riveting.  Also, I forgot how great June Carter's voice was.  Hearing her sisters and June as Johnny's opening act was a great highlight.  I may give a listen to some of her music in the future.",1108857600,,901,4.610062893081761
7899076,5,6305915997,"""Johnny Cash -- The Man, His World, His Music"" might adequately be called a period piece. Filmed in an age when music and film were decidedly low-tech, this DVD, which was released in some theaters as a film, captures a raw image of the Man in Black. Indeed, the picture and sound suffer a bit, but I don't imagine anyone anticipated a DVD release (or DVDs for that matter). That makes this film all the more worthwhile: it's not showy. All the focus is on the music, and there's plenty of that. The DVD is a bit ""campy"", but I like it.",1084492800,,536,4.264705882352941
7899077,5,6305915997,"Yes, the footage is ragged in spots, and there is nothing slick about this one. But there are gems you won't find elsewhere. Much of the concert footage is riveting, including Carl Perkins' rocking ""Blue Suede Shoes."" Some of the reasons for Johnny Cash's broad appeal also emerge here. Combined with his onstage showmanship and bravado are his backstage kindness and affection toward his fans which seem remarkable in today's era of chic contempt. He called his shots straight from the heart, and this DVD gives us the pleasure of watching that in detail. A must for the Cash fan, and for anyone who wonders what all the fuss was about.",1069545600,,637,4.747747747747748
7899078,4,6305915997,"This was not at all what I expected, but it was a rare treat.  It really is like one long home movie, scratchy, not at all slickly produced or well-edited, with footage of Johnny going about his daily routine, at home with his parents, walking through his now-vacant childhood home, on a farm with his children, visiting the gas station owner & other folks in his home town, interspersed with footage of Johnny (and others, including June Carter & her sisters) performing.  The performances are powerful, of course, but the real treat is seeing Johnny in his element, with his family & old neighbors.  The only odd aspect of the film is that it devotes significant time to other aspiring performers who want to play for Johnny -- It's interesting, but what it shows about Johnny (his reaction to these aspiring writers & performers) seems to be limited in comparison to the time given to others performing entire songs.  If you're looking for a slick musical production of Cash performing, you'll be disappointed.  If you want a behind-the-scenes look at the Man in Black, this is well worth the money.",1065139200,,1102,4.778947368421052
7899079,5,6305915997,"If you like Johnny Cash, this is a must. The picture and sound are good enough so as to not get in the way of enjoying the rare footage. His duet with Dylan is almost worth the price alone, but you also get to see Johnny with his parents, onstage doing most of his big hits and lots more(it's 90 minutes long). I felt it was a much more intimate portrait than the Anthology dvd which spends a lot of time interviewing Cash's friends and not with the man himself.",1042502400,,462,4.144444444444445
7899080,3,6305915997,"This was,I believe, originally a CBS special. I think the crew only hung around a week or so. Mr. Cash never sounds comfortable in front of the camera. Or maybie he always talks like he's being interviewed. And I must mention the sound and picture quality leave a lot to be desired. A poor mans Don't Look Back.
  Nevertheless, if you are a hard core fan of the man in black this DVD is essential.  There is concert footage of Johnny along with the Carter Family and others.  There is Johnny in the studio and a duet with Dylan.  Incidently nearly everyone is less stiff than Johnny.  I think a filmaker would have to follow him around for a couple of months before he would relax much. Oddly enough the most relaxed people seem to be the non celebrity's. If you are looking for a documentary masterpiece then pass this one by. If your a Cash completest then this film is indespencible. Fanatics of Dylan, the Carter Family or 70's Country then you will want this. Otherwise I'd leave it alone.",1026950400,,994,4.464088397790055
7899081,5,6305915997,"This is such an incredible opportunity! The fact that there was someone there on tour, on a hunt or backstage, filming Cash in the late sixties, is and of itself incredible. Sure, the sound quality and picture quality is not great, but folks, were talkin' the late SIXTIES!!! How many people even owned movie cameras then? If you did, how many of those movies do you still have, nevermind converted to DVD format? This film is historic! If you are a fan of the man in black, don't miss it. The studio session, with a then young Bob Dylan, cutting ""It's Been One Too Many Mornins' nad I'm a Thousand Miles Behind."" It's mightyfine-aaaah!",1001376000,,636,4.587719298245614
7899082,1,6305915997,"What a low-down-egg-suckin'-dog-shame.  I was SO looking forward to getting this disk.  Imagine, a man who is in the Country Music Hall of Fame, The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Song Writers Hall of Fame.  Can't say ANYTHING good about the disk.  The sound quality is not there at all.  The picture quality is not there either.  I think the general idea of the presentation might be ok, they just missed the mark.  In years to come, I hope someone doesn't come across THIS disk and wonder how the guy depicted could have received so many awards.  Leave this disk at the supplier and get the George Jones instead.",994550400,,619,4.464285714285714
