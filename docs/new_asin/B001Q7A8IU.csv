8434633,1,B001Q7A8IU,"First of all, the DVD I received is not the DVD I ordered.  I ordered ""More Families of Mexico"", since that was the one available in the region 1 format.  I received ""Families of Mexico.""  While it will play in my DVD player, the irony is that the dvd CASE, is all about the ""More Families of Mexico.""  In short, I have a dvd and a cd case that do not match.  Also, the audio is so bad on the first track that I can hardly even hear the narrator.  Either Amazon or the company producing this DVD need to get their act together.",1470182400,,527,4.019230769230769
