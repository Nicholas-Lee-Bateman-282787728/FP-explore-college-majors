3466382,2,B001AR60G0,"I hate remakes, KAIRO (Pulse) was a Japanese horror film that is quite iconic despite its slow-moving screenplay but it managed to generate a calculated, darkly sinister meditation on life and death with a disturbing denunciation with technology as a destroyer of living humanity. Kiyoshi Kurosawa's defining horror epic revolves around the approach to mortality as seemingly random build ups of related and unrelated events; brought about by a website that brings contact to the supernatural world. 2006's U.S. remake ""Pulse"" misunderstood Kurosawa's main premise and thereby resulted in a film full of creative misunderstanding. In Kairo the science was only secondary, it was more about mortality. ""Pulse"" shouldn't have been an unlimited ""night and weekend"" visual feast of cell phones and computers. This happens a lot of times when American filmmakers attempt to remake an Asian horror film.

Sure, PULSE 2: Afterlife isn't a remake of an Asian horror feature. It only expands on the idea of the U.S. remake of Kiyoshi Kurosawa's KAIRO. Directed and written by Joel Soisson (Mimic 2), the sequel isn't really a major visual spookfest, it does attempt to pull something perceivably new out of the bag; the problem is, it suffers from plot inconsistencies and horror movie clichs.

The world had been reshaped due to the emergence of ghost via the internet. Cities have been deserted, and the few survivors have relocated in small camps, in areas believed to be `dead zones'. Survivors leave behind electrical devices in their relocated areas. Ghosts now wander the Earth in the form of electrical impulses; they continue to haunt their homes and some are unaware that they are dead. Stephen (Jamie Bamber) must now find a way to save his daughter Jusitne from her dead mother Michelle.

All right, at first I thought I was about to watch a George Romero feature with ghosts in place rather than zombies. Truth be told, such a film would have been more interesting. I'm not really sure why they felt that a sequel would be necessary (then again, I don't know why they keep on remaking Asian Horror films). The film picks up from the supposed remnants of the first movie. People do know that something had gone terribly wrong and they try to survive.

Director Joel Soisson does try to make some sense on the myth that is ""Kairo"". I have to credit the man for trying to explore the myths of the spirit world. This time, he focuses on a father and child being haunted by a dead mother. The film does somewhat feel like a ""custody battle"" being fought between the material and the spirit world. While he tries, he falls to the same clichs in horror films, I can't really blame him, he had so little to work with and as I've said, even the first film greatly misunderstood Kurosawa's iconic horror film.

The film is actually a chase film of a sort. Stephen isn't really the perfect dad, he had an affair that somewhat justifies his ex-wife's anger. Michelle the dead mother is a little underdeveloped and I found it quite difficult to connect with her. Also, the timetable lacks credibility, or at least not really fully explored. The film does try to throw some ideas in an attempt to add some depth to its simple plot. A guy going around looking like a ""Red Riding Hood"" reject is presented but that subplot goes nowhere. (Maybe there's a Pulse 3?) The small town where Stephen and his daughter fled from is also severely underdeveloped. What happened after they left? Enter the nudity.

To its credit, the film does have a few spooky images. The idea of the dead not knowing they're dead is an idea with potential. While its visuals aren't really original and looks like a rip-offs from ""The Ring"" or from a Pang Bros. horror film, the film does manage to generate some scares, however cheap they may be. The scenes of suicide presented potential, but then again, that idea can only go so far. The problem with Pulse 2 is that it suffered from inconsistencies in plot. I thought ghosts can only find you when you have a cell phone or a computer, as reinforced by its first half then we Michelle able to follow Justine (Karla Scott Collins). By the brain's electrical activity perhaps? Maybe, but this possibility has no credible explanation. The film just goes into one dead end after another. The film's climax doesn't offer much either, except for the horror that is a possibility for ""Pulse 3"".

PULSE 2: AFTERLIFE isn't the worst horror film you'll find out there but you can definitely find something better quite easily. The issues with the film is that it tried too hard to capitalize on the first film's backdrop that it felt a little rushed and perfunctory. The script felt as if it had been rewritten numerous times. It failed to present a single memorable scene and the film just feels forgettable. It felt too textbook for my tastes and followed the same old flaws in a sequel. American filmmakers missed the point of Kurosawa's KAIRO, thinking that it was just another J-horror flick about a journey into the spirit world. I am not arrogant to say that all of them missed the idea but they definitely messed up its reinterpretation. This sequel just further reinforces that viewpoint.

3466383,3,B001AR60G0,"For those of you who don't know, the first Pulse, just like the Grudge, the Ring, and that awful excuse for a Godzilla movie back in 98, was an Americanized version of a Japanese movie. And just like those movies, the original was better. Where the original Kairo had some nice, deep, philosophical themes regarding death and the afterlife, as well as some nice symbolism with the red tape, being placed around the door and window frames like marking your doors with lamb's blood to ensure the angel of death would pass your house, Pulse was just another science went too far and unleashed Pandora's box, and the tape was turned into some lame excuse about the frequency of the colour red interfering with that of the ghosts.

Pulse 2 was slightly better than Pulse in my opinion. The budget was lower, but it was a little deeper. Don't get me wrong, there aren't any twists or turns that you probably won't see coming from a mile away, but still, I thought it was a fairly interesting choice to start the story off from two different perspectives, that of the ghosts, and that of the living, with the ghosts not realizing they're dead yet. For anyone wondering by the way, there is no Kairo 2, only Pulse 2. The Japanese, unlike Hollywood, seem to know when they've got a good thing going and don't try to push out as many sequels as they can until they've bled the franchise dry and left it for dead.

So, if you liked Pulse, but hated Kairo, I'd probably advise not to buy this movie, unless you can find it from the bargain bin for like $3. If you liked Kairo but hated Pulse, well frankly I still wouldn't advise spending much more than $3, $5 tops, it's not that great of a movie, and for the price you could pick up a couple of bargain bin DVD's that ARE worth it.",1242691200,,1771,4.396341463414634
3466384,3,B001AR60G0,"The events of Pulse 2:Afterlife happens right after the events in the first film. The ghosts end up invading and are claiming lives like you wouldn't imagine. Survivors take shelter in remote parts of the country where wireless communication signals cannot reach. Our hero travels to a ghost-infested city to see if his daughter is still alive. He finds her but gets more than he bargains for. That's where the story begins.

Like the first movie, I didn't find too much bad about the sequel. It kept my interest til the end but, sadly, this movie was uninspired and fell flat on delivering the thrill and chills that a Japanese horror film story would. The look of the ghosts was horrible(just grease paint and actors trying to look scary), nothing like the first film. In this film, they are flickering tv images.  No spooky looking ghosts here, folks. I thought we'd get treated to some good special features, at least, but all we get are commentary, two deleted scenes and a quick look at Pulse 3. After this movie, I'm not so sure I'll be returning for the third installment. We'll wait and see.

The only thing I can suggest is you rent this one. To buy? well- if it's cheap in a bargain bin somewhere....but I wouldn't pay full price for this. While it was a decent for a low budget movie, it didn't WOW me like the first one did.",1234828800,6,1337,4.516528925619835
3466385,1,B001AR60G0,"I was never really all that fond of the first Pulse film, but it did have a few redeeming qualities about it, which is much, much more than what can be said about this direct to DVD sequel.  Picking up after the events of the first film, with dead spirits inhabiting and wreaking havoc upon the world, Pulse 2: Afterlife stars Battlestar Galactica's Jamie Bamber as a father searching for his missing daughter, leading into a run-in with his deceased wife who happens to be quite angry.  As a direct to DVD sequel, it's safe to say that you wouldn't be expecting much, but what's here with Pulse 2 is nothing worthwhile in the very least.  As noted beforehand in the above Amazon review, the awful green-screen use detracts so much from what's going on that can't help but notice it.  That being said, you're not really missing much anyway, as Pulse 2 offers up terrible acting, non-sensical moments and plot holes aplenty (with some left open for Pulse 3), and even more terrible effects work.  Director/producer Joel Soisson, responsible for many other needless direct to DVD sequels, is behind Pulse 2, and it further helps to qualify the man as getting closer to being a modern-day schlock-master.  Avoid, even if you immensely enjoyed the first film.",1232928000,,1255,4.76036866359447
3466386,1,B001AR60G0,"Simply put there was absolutely no need for this film. The first one wasn't too bad but out of the trilogy I actually liked the third one best.

3466391,3,B001AR60G0,"For a dvd to watch on a bored Saturday or Sunday morning it isn't so bad, but not the kind of movie that will keep you awake for a late movie night in. Definitely not worth the full-price of a new dvd; I recommend RENTING vs buying. Overall impression of the movie is that it doesn't have the intensity or thrill factor of the original-- no real ""jump out of your skin"" moments. I see where they incorporated the supernatural qualities from the first film but unfortunately it didn't translate into ""stellar sequel"". Pretty much a watered down continuation of the first. The plot centered too much around a few PARTICULAR spirits rather than the overall all battle between the dead and the living for domination over the earth.  It would have been better if the story focused more on a post-apocalyptic existence for the droves of survivors who fled into a life without technology, and if the ghosts would have been more violent and powerful in their efforts to dominate the world of the living. Too bad because this concept had potential to be a great sequel.  I think I may end up selling this movie to a dvd exchange since I don't see myself hitting the replay button on this one more than once more in my movie watcher lifetime.",1223337600,,1232,4.545045045045045
3466392,2,B001AR60G0,"Pulse 2 picks up where the original movie left off. IF you know where that is, you're doing better than most. Stephen, a man on the run from his ghost of an ex-wife, is searching for his daughter Justine, along with his wife. Theres also a sequel plug involving the only intelligent cast member, who learned the fine art of paper mache and dyeing to be able to walk outside without getting soul yanked. The subplot starts and ends like a phantasm, almost flitting over the surface, cameoed from a as unreleased chapter.

The movie orinigally follows Michelle, Stephens dead ex-wife. If you can't pick up on the fact that shes dead 4 minutes into the movie, the rest of it will be a rollercoaster thrill ride.

The filomography is very, very strange. I almost hazard to guess the did 5/6ths of it with CGI, painting in backgronuds for sets that they should've easily been able to get or build. Either that, or they have some new funky camera setup I've not encountered before.

The acting is the only thing that brought this up to two stars. Stephen and Michelle had decent players that could carry an otherwise bad script, and several of the sceen actors and extras were also rather good. While several scenes are odd to begin with, they make more sense once you know they're dead. There are a couple absolute dog scenes, but only one grauitous nudity scene, which, considering thats how movies like this make up their bottom line, seemed to show a suprising amount of restraint.

Special effects were nonexistant, and papered over from the original movie. There were a few half decent startles, but don't waste more than a rental fee.",1223164800,4,1635,4.666666666666667

8279268,1,B001AR60G0,"don't bother.. just don't bother.  This movie went ""straight to DVD"".. when it should have just went straight into the garbage.

anyone who says otherwise, is either a cape, yes man, or a closet fecal-philiac (affinity for turds).. who doesn't know any better.

Pulse 2 is a sequel..

Do you know what creates a sequel in the horror movie genre. Very simple. Someone reboots the same stupidity that started the first horror movie.

In this sequel it's obvious. Forget the green screens for a moment and let's look at just a small bit of the screenplay/plot - well there isn't one really.

1) The lead actor has a dead wife. This dead wife per se, wants to unite with her ""live"" child. (but with the girl's poor acting skills - you'd think she's dead to begin with)..

2) The lead male finds his child alive while the dead mom is running down ETERNAL FLIGHTS of steps from her apt. to get to them before they drive off. - Yet she can flash move down steps in to get to her victims in a blink of an eye.  Specifically the chick the lead male actor has an affair with.

3) The lead and child flee to an outpost in the woods where they are checked for ""markings"" before they are admitted in. Yet there he has this big as(*( COMPUTER that he bought with him.

4)The lead's girlfriend shows up later, and tries to have sex in the middle of this crisis. (Great timing).. when GUESS WHAT?? That's right, friends and neighbors - THE COMPUTER COMES ON..

4a) They both stare at it like Dumb and Dumber wondering ""How did that happen?"" The lead goes to turn it off, walking VEEEERRRRRY SLOOOOOOOOOWLY toward it.. and he gets ready to hit the off button.. The girlfriend stops him.. This takes about 5- 10 minutes of the audiences time, by the way.

4b) They both read the emails the dead wife is sending..the girlfriend grabs a golf club yep, the one who stopped the lead in the first place - gets ready to swing and - HE STOPS HER..

This repeated ""hesitation"" tactic from the director took, i'd say about another 10 mins. of rolling/wasted film before the girl friend hurls the computer over in the corner.

Then of course, the lead male. Waits until everyone's asleep.. Does what every horror sequel lead actor/actress does - something stupid. He emails the dead wife, and... she comes through the computer..

Next thing you know.. we have the same recipe of all horror movie cliches..

Ghost appears

Victims run..run.. add more useless/footage/characters to break the monotony (specifically an old man who locked himself in a room to keep ""Aunt Carmen"" out)..with his ""dinner"" - the cat Mr. Pepper.. then..

run..Rinse.... repeat, and let's wait for the NEXT sequel..

Guess what happens  in the sequel #3? the idiot offspring of the male lead actor.. is in a camp, free of computers/cell phones etc. and what does she do?

the same thing that her ""father did"" DISCOVERS a computer (the last working computer, BTW) she winds up communicating with her mom who leads her back to where???

you wouldn't guess it in a million years!!!.. back to the city.. where it ALLLLLLL STARRRRRRTED..

and .. run.. rinse... repeat...",1380153600,,3111,4.606170598911071

As punishment, I watched all three Pulse movies in a row and felt deservedly chastised as a result.  It wasn't just the matter of the money that I wasted, it was the time lost on such a dreary series.
As for this film, it went from the global realization of the first film to a simple family melodrama complete with a cheating ex-husband, his mistress, his ex-wife, and a daughter caught in the middle.  While I appreciated the attempt to personalize the issue, the problem remains the same; if you don't find the original premise valid, going smaller with the story isn't going to help.  It's still a silly idea and a sillier solution (hiding out in ""dead zones"").  Not even the novelty of filming it from the perspective of some of the ghosts could save this tedious effort.",1351382400,,930,4.578313253012048
