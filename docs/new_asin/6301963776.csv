391859,3,6301963776,I enjoy looking at shows from the past and this was once a theatrical release.  It is very different from The Green Hornet of the 1960s in which Kato has more outstanding role.  The Black Beauty in the later version is equipped with more gadgets.  I guess for the 40s this a modern movie of that time.,1070150400,,301,4.245614035087719

Soundtrack: English Dolby Digital mono; bonus serial chapters.(Green Hornet History)

Plot:
A series of seemingly unconnected fraud and robbery rackets has the city abuzz, and newspaper publisher Britt Reid (Gordon Jones) tackles it-accompanied by Asian aide Kato (Keye Luke)-as the Green Hornet, in this feature-length adventure condensed from the classic serial. The masked crimefighter's screen debut co-stars Anne Nagel, Phillip Trent. Includes the original black-and-white version and an enhanced cut with colorized scenes. 84 min. Standard; Soundtrack: English Dolby Digital mono; bonus serial chapters.
The Green Hornet is an American radio and comic book masked vigilante created by George W. Trendle and Fran Striker, with input by radio director James Jewell, in 1936. Since his radio debut in the 1930s, the Green Hornet has appeared in numerous serialized dramas in a wide variety of media. The character appeared in film serials in the 1940s, a network television program in the 1960s, multiple comic book series from the 1940s on, and a feature film in January 2011.
Though various incarnations sometimes change details, in most versions the Green Hornet is the alter ego of Britt Reid, a newspaper publisher by day who goes out in his masked ""Green Hornet"" identity at night to fight crime as a vigilante. He is accompanied by his similarly masked partner and confidant, Kato, who drives their technologically advanced car, the ""Black Beauty.""
I have been a Green Hornet fan since the TV series first appeared in 1966.
I just watched the Green Hornet marathon of all episodes. It was great. I thought it would be as campy and cheesy as Batman (although I grew up on that and still like it), but it wasn't. Yeah, some of the effects were low grade, and the scenes of the Black Beauty driving around town were always the exact same clips, but I still liked it a lot.",1306022400,,1890,5.0576923076923075
391960,5,6301963776,"The Green Hornet movie version has everything that I could ever want. Along with the original black and white feature, most interesting is the colorized version which is 'comic bookish' and very nicely done in the video format. Also great is the menu window where rather than watching the entire movie, I can choose any chapter that I desire to watch. Being a movie theater serial fan, I hope that in the future, more of the old serials are done like this.",1303257600,,456,4.573170731707317
391961,3,6301963776,"Here is an honest review of VCI's dvd of ""The Green Hornet: Movie Edition"" and the extras therein:

The original serial is edited down to an 84-minute feature film. What you get on this dvd is two versions of the same cut. The first one has a sepia tint throughout with occasional green tints, yellow tints, pink, orange (and combinations thereof) thrown in for good measure.. as well as beefed-up sound effects here and there. The second version is the original B&W print without psychedelic doodling from the boffins in the colorizing suite and it's far the superior version. A good print in glorious monochrome. This second print of the film is to be found in the ""Extras"" section of the dvd. You also get the first two chapters of the original serial. Both chapters are fine prints as well.

That's all you'll get here and, for the price, it's a fair deal. There are no radio shows nor photo galleries as another review has started.

Enjoy!",1302480000,4,944,4.640718562874252
391962,4,6301963776,"Britt Reid, rich playboy and publisher of the influential newspaper the Sentinel, needed something to galvanize him into derring-do. Everything else was in place. His resources? Maybe the fastest car in the world, a nifty gas gun, a secret garage from which to operate, and the invaluable aide of Kato, a brilliant Korean inventor and Reid's tough and trusty valet. When rampant racketeering threatens to overrun the city, Britt Reid creates the guise of the crusading pulp hero, the Green Hornet. I guess, it turns out, Britt Reid prefers a more hands-on approach over scribing scathing editorials against organized crime.

This is the fast-moving ""Movie Edition"" of the 1940 13-episode Green Hornet serial. It's a sort of compromise for those, like me, who love these old serials but occasionally get tired of the length and repetitive tone the chapters take on. This ""film"" tightens up the serial, features the origin of the Green Hornet, and tracks his ongoing struggle against a powerful criminal syndicate and its shadowy mastermind. Let me be quick to say that, for full appreciation and proper immersion and if you've got time to spare, nothing beats watching THE GREEN HORNET's entire 13 chapters. That way, you get more of the Hornet and Kato in action.

I don't know who Gordon Jones is or what else he's done, but he's perfectly fine as Britt Reid and the Hornet. Jones demonstrates all the qualities his dual roles beg for, namely a square and determined jaw, a certain athletic grace, and a reassuringly solid presence. Chinese actor Keye Luke never achieved the dynamism of Bruce Lee, but as Kato he wasn't half shabby and he certainly karate chopped the baddies with conviction. I enjoyed Keye Luke's performance and appreciated the writers for lending smarts and dignity to an Oriental sidekick. I certainly couldn't help but smile when Kato, ever polite, apologized to a goon before tying him up. Let's not neglect the fact that Keye Luke did his part in paving the way for Asian actors in Hollywood. Guys like George Takei and Bruce Lee were all too happy to follow in his footsteps.

As the token damsel in the thing, Anne Nagel is feisty as Britt's secretary Leonore ""Casey"" Case. Of course she thinks the Green Hornet is wonderful. And here's a nice bit of trivia: Going uncredited is radio star Al Hodge. To add a measure of continuity for those who'd listened to his earlier Green Hornet radio broadcasts, Al Hodge dubbed in the Hornet's voice whenever Gordon Jones donned the mask. And I really liked Hodge's cadence and delivery.

Truncated from a 13-chapter serial, with a running time of 84 minutes, the pace speeds along at a really good clip. A costumed crime fighter's job is never done. In trying to stem the rising crime wave, the Green Hornet investigates shady doings at a tunneling project, boards a sabotaged airplane at a failing flight school, and is trapped in a riot at a struggling carnival (in which we glimpse a brief but furious fight between a lion and a tiger). The racketeers soon get wise to the Hornet's interference, but even before that they have it in for Britt Reid in his guise as publisher of the Sentinel. Can the Hornet arrive in time to foil an attempt to blow up the Sentinel building?

The Hornet's crime fighting is hampered by the police who regard the masked vigilante as a criminal himself. Maybe, at the scene of the crime, Britt Reid shouldn't be too quick to leave his calling cards, which are these funny coasters designed with the Green Hornet emblem. (Okay, they're not actually coasters.) Less silly and infinitely more cool is the ""Flight of the Bumblebee"" score which we hear whenever the Green Hornet's souped up sedan, Black Beauty, hurtles thru the streets, sometimes in excess of 200 mph. That's certainly fast enough to get the Green Hornet and Kato to the crooked mastermind's headquarters, wherein they serve up an ironic brand of vigilante justice. The Avenger would certainly approve. What fun!

Note that the ""Movie Edition"" feature presentation has been touched up a bit. Introductory scenes are shown in green washes - and sometimes other hues - which soon dissolve into a sepia color, which is how most of the feature is then viewed. The DVD also includes the Original Feature Cut which is in the original black and white and how I prefer to watch the movie. And, just to show off, the DVD also has Chapters 1 & 2 from the Original GREEN HORNET Serial (totaling 00:41:50 minutes).",1302393600,,4467,4.817470664928292

7818446,4,6301963776,"First, this is NOT the original serial release of The Green Hornet and it is NOT a feature version edited back in the 40s or 50s.

This release is a modern editing of the original 13-chapter serial from 3-plus hours, down to an 84-minute feature.

Included on the DVD are two versions of the modern feature cut.

One version has a sepia tint throughout with occasional green, yellow, pink, orange tints used for special effects, scene changes, etc. In addition, there are enhanced sound effects used throughout. Yes, this version could be considered blasphemy by purists, but it's just done in fun and the results are enjoyable if a little jarring at first.

The second version included is an ""un-enhanced"" version of the feature cut, presented in good ol' black and white. This is a solid print and a great addition to the set, giving one an option depending on their mood that day.

The only extras are the first two chapters of the original serial. I would have preferred a featurette on the decision making and editing process used for the modern cut, as the complete serial is available on other (great) releases from VCI.
