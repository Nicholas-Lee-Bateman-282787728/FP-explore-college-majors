667199,2,6303521436,"This movie was one of the worst I've seen in this genre.  Being a Stephen King and Robert Englund fan, I was not only disgusted but shocked when I rushed to pick up this video 4 years ago.  I watched Nightmare on Elm Street for the first time at 4 years old, and it was love at first sight.  I've been a blood and guts fan ever since.  Robert Englund's acting was a superb additive to King's story.  The plot and story line matches the original novel, which is rare with horror movies.  However,  it just was NOT scary.  For God's sake people it's a rusty machine.  Get real.

667200,3,6303521436,"With a great looking mechanical monster and a plot that expands Stephen King's little horror story (but does not adequately explore its expansion), Tobe Hooper's The Mangler is a near miss.  The movie needs more than a little editorial tinkering, cutting to be precise.  Far too many scenes, if not all of them, run far too long, passing the point taken and are you stretching this boundaries and plunging right into DO SOMETHING ELSE ALREADY territory.  Nonetheless, when The Mangler is in action and revealing its demonic personality the movie is, more or less, worth sitting through.  Englund is a hoot as well, firmly embracing Vincent Price's lay on the ham with relish acting philosophy.  Worth at least one viewing.",997142400,9,722,4.983333333333333
667201,4,6303521436,"In this film Stephen King touches a quite common theme in his fiction : the evilness of industrialism. But in this case the machine is not possessed by an animal monster like in The Nightshift, or by an It like in IT. It is possessed by the devil itself, but the devil of power. This machine, this devil needs sacrifice and those who have power have to sacrifice something to it to get this power. They have to feed its hunger for fresh blood, virginal blood and belladonna. The machine tries to eat the people who are using belladonna for their nerves and the machine receives human sacrifices from those who want power. If you want to evade giving a part of yourself, you have to sacrifice a young virginal sixteen-year-old girl of your family. And there is no way to stop it. It cannot be exorcised by anything. No holy water, no holy wafer, no biblical incantation will stop it, and even if one powerful person is sacrificed, then another one will benefit of this sacrifice, another one who will have given, by accident or willingly, a part of himself or herself, a finger or an arm. This vision of industrialism as a devilish possession is a rare way to show that industrial work is slavery and total alienation. This vision of power in this industrial society as a pact signed with the devil that inhabits the machine is a rare denunciation of capitalism. And yet, since this is linked to a tradition as old as humanity, it is human social life, and the organisation of human society on a power pattern that is denounced in the most general way. One little element shows how this power-giving and blood-hungry devil works : the photographer and then the intellectual who discover the existence of this devil and try to denounce it and even exorcise it are killed by the super power of this devil. It does not like being known. It likes secrecy and ignorance. The film is extremely effective in its powerful images and symbols and it is heart gripping. A very rare introduction to Stephen King's realm of horror. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",984355200,6,2070,4.612466124661246

The Sequels of Stephen King

by

M. M.

  Stephen King has written many sequels.  Big Wheels: a Tale of the Laundry Game (Milkman # 2), The Way Station, The Slow Mutants, The Gunslinger and the Dark Man, The Dark Tower II: the Drawing of the Three, The Dark Tower III: the Wastelands and Wizard and Glass to name a few.  There are also The Regulators and Desperation.  There is also, what I like to call the Castle Rock stories.
  Nona, Cujo, The Sun Dog, The Body, The Dark Half, Sleepwalkers, Needful Things and It Grows on You.  The Breathing Method is a sequel to The Man who Would Not Shake Hands.  Stephen King once wrote a sequel to the Cthulhu mythos.  One for the Road is a sequel to Salems Lot.
  Nevertheless, Stephen King didn't write all of his own sequels.  In 92, they wrote Pet Sematary Two.  Then they made Children of the Corn II: the Final Sacrifice.  Then there came Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest.
  Then there came Sometimes They Come Back Again.  Then there was Children of the Corn IV: the Gathering.  Then there is The Rage: Carrie 2.  Finally, there is Children of the Corn V: Field of Terror, Children of the Corn 666 and Children of the Corn (2009) the remake maybe don't you think?  Yes; course there is!!

Followed the story for the most part, but was somewhat boring toward the end and I couldn't stay engaged with it.  My daughter fell asleep, too.",1349913600,,275,4.230769230769231
667420,5,6303521436,"The Mangler is one of those horror films that people kinda forget about but know it's locked away somewhere in their memories. It hasn't been well received through the years and it is maintaining a decent cult fan base. I'm still a fan, not just because it is directed by Texas Chainsaw Massacre director Tobe Hooper and based off a short story by Stephen King, but it is entertaining and frightening to a degree.

 The story may be weak but it does cut right to the point: a laundry-folding machine in a factory starts going berserk and starts munching innocent people up. Robert Englund portrays another creepy character much like his Freddy Krueger (even in heavy makeup as well and metallic legs to boot) as the factory owner who refuses to shut the machine down. Enter Ted Levine (Buffalo Bill) as a police detective hellbent on bringing the machine down for good.

Now, to be honest, the movie itself isn't really that scary, but the set designs really are. Even some of the shots Tobe Hooper sets up have a lurking feel to them. The film's true creep factor comes from that frigging huge mother of a machine itself, created by Tobe Hooper's son, William. Just the opening shot alone sums up the creep factor in the film when the camera pans across the machine with its massive gears (fun factor, my last name Watson even appears on the front of the machine, kinda creepy lol). The scene with the possessed ice box has an effective moment when Ted Levine whacks it with a sledgehammer. That there does have a Stephen King feel if you ask me. But the movie comes to life in the end when that machine explodes and the creepy-ass monster inside comes out. Now that is something that's out of a FRIGGIN NIGHTMARE! The effects used to bring the monster to life are amazing and it still gives me chills when it comes after the heroes. Still not the scariest movie I've ever seen but if watched late at night, you may wanna bolt your door shut in case you think that creature's coming after you.

In short, The Mangler is an underrated horror classic that is sure to capture many horror fans alike out there, including fans of Stephen King, Robert Englund, and Tobe Hooper. There are two sequels made but they are best avoided, as they don't possess the ominous and creepy feel as this movie does. Even after 17 years, this movie has an ever-growing fanbase. It is a shame that Tobe Hooper never got the strength back that he had with his first few movies (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Salem's Lot, and Poltergeist are by far his best films) but his films do have a certain feel to them, as most filmmakers put into their films. This one is simply another little gem of horror that is still shining greatly.",1343779200,3,2702,4.542094455852156

667493,2,6303521436,"There are only two things that I liked about The Mangler. Those are Robert Englund's twisted performance, and the gore. Everything else about this horror film, from the script to the direction to most of the acting is pretty bad. I don't know how someone goes from directing decent to great movies like Poltergeist, The Funhouse, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, to directing crap like this, but Tobe Hooper did it.",1306281600,,415,4.859154929577465
667494,3,6303521436,"Tobe Hooper returns to the works of Stephen King in this uneven possession tale. The blood of a young virgin brings to life a monstrous laundry press, which goes on to crush and dismember anyone that goes near it. It is up to a blundering cop and his New Age neighbor to release the demons trapped in the machine in order to stop it once and for all. As ridiculous as the premise may be, THE MANGLER delivers on its promise of torn limbs and bloodied bodies. Outside of these few gory moments, however, the film fails to deliver a coherent story or any interesting characters. Hunter's shoddy police work along with his neighbor's crackpot theories line the script with tiresome filler and very little action. Robert Englund also appears in a throwaway cameo as William Gartley, owner of the Blue Ribbon Laundry who's soul is tied to the infernal machine, but even his slimy performance misses the mark. This is certainly one of the weaker King adaptations from the 90's.

667496,2,6303521436,"I picked up the book Stephen King Goes To The Movies where this story is featured. When I read the synopsis and what Stephen had to say about it in his commentary, I was kind of on the fence by the time I got around to reading the story. However, once I read the story all doubts were thrown out the window. As wacky and off the wall as the concept of the story is, I thought it was great!
A couple months later I look the movie up on Netflix and it turns out it is an instant watch (which means I don't have to pay for it or wait for the disc to come in the mail for those out there who aren't familiar with Netflix.) The first thing that catches my attention is that the movie is 1 hour and 45 minutes. Now how do you take a short story and make it into an almost 2 hour movie? Despite this, I had an open mind going into the viewing.
It started out pretty good. Pretty much like the story. People get caught in the machine and what not. Luckily the movie didn't stray too far from the short story... to start with. After about 30 minutes things start getting added in. Unneccessary things! Too much. More than I ever wanted to know. This would have been a highly enjoyable horror movie if it would have been kept at an hour tops.
I will say that I was surprised at how good ""The Mangler"" actually looked. Going into the movie, I imagined horrible animation. The acting was okay but nothing noteworthy in my opinion.
Overall, I decided to watch this movie simply because I am a big Stephen King fan and am working my way through most of his books and all of the movies based off of his books. In the end, my advice is for people to read the short shory (as goofy as it sounds) but skip the movie unless you are a huge Robert Englund or Ted Levine fan.",1277769600,,1753,4.069364161849711

Ah yes I still remember it like it was yesterday when another Stephen King story was adapted to come to the big screen, this time with Tobe Hooper at helm and Robert Englund as a star. ""The Mangler"" was and still is one of those movies that people either love or hate at least those around me. I happen to be one of those who loves it or at least loves it for the most part. I mean this is far from a classic but it is fun or at least I think so, how times am I going to say ""or at least""?

There is a factory out there that owns and operates a demon infested or possessed laundry folding machine and it has a taste for blood. After taking the life of a nice woman who was just minding her business and working a detective named John Hunton [the always great Ted Levine] starts working the case and after countless people are being eaten by this thing he starts to listen to a friend who knows about the paranormal. But the owner of the factory, a freak of a man named Bill Gartley [Robert Englund], knows what is going on a little more than he should. Based on the Stephen King story this one is actually entertaining despite what most say about the film.

While I will agree that this film is not the classic it could have been it is far from horrible, the first third of the film is great to be exact. The last 15 mins could have used some work but I thought it was good. When this first came out I actually know some one who threw up after seeing the pill [what was left] of the first victim. Director Tobe Hooper I thought did a great job with this film especially with the look of it. The tone of the film and darkness of it just stand out to me. Along with writers Stephen Brooks and Peter Welbeck this is a good enough adaptation of the short story from King, although the script could have used some work.

As far as the acting Ted Levine is brilliant in my mind as the lead detective John Hunton and does a great job. Robert Englund is completely over the top in this film but I think that really fits his characters look. I mean the guy has no legs and is completely torn up, over the top is this guy. Every one else in this film are good and pull off their roles well but you have to remember what type of flick this is. People hate on this film all the time but I have good memories with this film, the first time I watched this happened to be on one of the most fun nights I have ever had.

Some people hate this movie others love it and I find myself loving it, although I do realize it has flaws. I have had good times watching this movie and think that the atmosphere of it is great. Sure this is not the best movie ever and is not even the best horror movie ever but it is fun. Ted is brilliant and funny as always and Robert hams it up like no other. Watch this for your self as a rental or something and judge for your self.",1255651200,2,2857,4.022887323943662

I remember reading the short story of the Mangler and thinking it was some of King's worst writing. Then I remember I have a weakness for really bad horror movies, so I picked this baby up. Aside from a few cool scenes of gore, this movie just drags on and on. Englund's acting is really not up to par on film; He seems wooden and not into the role. Also, films based on King novels are never that good, ive recently discovered. Read a book instead of watching this movie.",1203984000,,633,4.372881355932203

667580,4,6303521436,"The Mangler's not one of the more popular King adaptations.  The inspiration for King's story most likely was how nasty it would be if someone actually got caught in one of those steam irons.  It certainly would be a horrific scene, but as nasty as that is, it's not a concept you can really make a feature film around.  That's probably why King wrote it as a short story.  Stretching the short story into a feature length film requires much more plot to be added(the short story may have had a half hour worth of film material, tops).  Alot of folks who bash this film usually have something along the lines of....""With the talent involved, how could it be this bad?""...to say.  Well, most horror fans have a hard time admitting to themselves that since Texas Chainsaw, Tobe Hooper has become increasingly schlocky as the years go by.  We all know it, we just don't say it.  Englund hasn't always made the best stuff, and not every King story is a winner.  In The Mangler, Hooper is trying to actually make the film scary.  The tone is much more serious than subject matter like this should be.  Sure, the first scene where the machine claims it's first victim is effective, but by the time you reach two grown men performing an exorcism on a laundry folder, and then having the machine turn into a Lovecraftian monster, it's just too damn silly.  So why the four stars?  Well, I actually do enjoy this movie quite a bit.  If you want to view this with the intention of getting your pants scared off, it'll fail.  If you view The Mangler as drive-in fare, it's fun.  It's got some nasty gore, an over the top villain played by Robert Englund, funny lines(both intentional and unintentional), and the film is actually shot very well.  As others have stated, the acting is hammy, particularly in Englund's case.  However, certain mention should go to Ted ""wasn't she a great big fat person"" Levine.  The film is practically a showcase for Levine's odd performance.  Is he being campy and over the top?  Is he serious and coming off as goofy?  It's hard to tell for sure, but he's always amusing and never boring to watch.  I think the guy's actually a good actor and it was cool to see him in a leading role.  If this were made today, it'd be Orlando Friggin' Bloom or some other schmuck that's mistaken for a good actor.  My disappointment with this dvd is that it's the theatrical R-rated version.  One of the special features shows a split-screen comparisson of the R and unrated versions.  Why the hell not just put those snippets back in the movie?  Especially in these days where studios are so ""unrated"" hogwild.  I'm surprised we didn't see an unrated version of Happy Feet when it csme out on dvd.  I used to have a vhs copy of this movie, and it was the unrated version with the extra nastiness.  So, I know it can be done.  The deleted bits are quick gore shots that actually do enhance the scenes and make them much nastier.  But anyhow, I do actually think this is a pretty fun movie...depending on how you look at it,that is.",1180051200,17,3038,4.495429616087751

667582,2,6303521436,"Legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre creator Tobe Hooper directed this adaptation of a Stephen King short story for New Line Cinema, and sadly, it doesn't work at all.  The last time the names Hooper and King were in the same sentence together was when Hooper crafted the classic, original Salem's Lot mini-series, but there's no magic here like there was before.  Maybe it's because the story itself wasn't one of King's better ones, or maybe Hooper didn't put everything into it.  The story revolves around a cop (Silence of the Lambs' Ted Levine) assigned to investigate strange and grisly murders, all of which point to a laundry press which appears to be posessed.  The owner of the factory (Robert ""Freddy Kruger"" Englund) seems to not be concerned about any of this, and by the time revelations are made, you probably won't care.  The story has it's share of faults, while Hooper's direction is uninspired.  There's some nice gore, and Levine and Englund are good, even though it's hard to seperate Englund from his infamous role as a horror icon.  All in all, the Mangler may be worth seeing if you're a fan of Tobe Hooper or Stephen King, but don't expect anything special out of it.",1127606400,8,1189,4.770731707317073
667583,4,6303521436,"An adaptation of the classic short story by Stephen King, and the first time (and so far only) King, director Tobe Hooper and star Robert Englund - three of horror's MVPs - share billing on a movie.  As great as the original story was (now would be a good time to observe that certain themes can only be handled by certain writers, and to ask the rhetorical question of 'Could anybody but Stephen King have actually written a horror story about a possessed laundry machine and not have it come off an absolute joke?') the movie actually surpasses it.  The danger with adapting novels to the screen is that often the material gets compressed down to fit a certain running time; I think a lot more great movies (certainly in the horror field) have come from short stories or novellas than lengthy novels (although there are certainly examples of the other: the best adaptations of ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"", King's own ""Pet Sematary"" and a number of tv miniseries {+ some non-horror movies}; ""Nightbreed"", etc.)  With ""The Mangler"" the challenge is the opposite from what you get when you try to fit all of a novel into a movie; there's not enough of the short story to make a full movie.

  So what we have instead is a ""Mangler"" that's been greatly expanded in all directions, not only continuing on well past the immortal last line of the written story but adding in a major twist on the origin of the possessed machine plus greater character development and subplots.  A move that could have fizzled out but pays off in spades, resulting in a character-strong, gory and - most difficult of all to achieve given the subject matter of a possessed industrial cleaning machine - believable tale of carnage and conspiracies, and the overwhelmed protagonists caught in the bloody crosshairs.  The Mangler is less of an idea here and more of a character unto itself, and in this version of the tale it's not the only villian lurking in the secrets of town.  Nine out of ten; a terribly under-rated movie.",1127347200,4,2002,4.6971428571428575
667584,2,6303521436,"""The Mangler"" is a film that should have never gotten a green light. Period. This is an embarrassment for nearly everyone involved, and that's saying something when you look at the talent in front of and behind the camera. First of all, you've got a movie based on a Stephen King short story. O.K., that's hardly a ringing endorsement considering how many sludgefests we've seen on the silver screen with, ""Based on a story by Stephen King"" above or below the title, but STILL. We ought to expect something special, right? Uh huh. Second, we've got Robert Englund camping it up as one of the two main baddies in the film. Not only that, he stomps about in old guy makeup with metal accoutrements hanging off his every limb. Cool, right? Well, yeah--except we don't see nearly enough of him. Third, and finally, none other than Tobe Hooper assumed the directorial duties for ""The Mangler."" The man behind the brilliant ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" and ""The Funhouse"" stepping up to the plate to knock another horror movie out of the ballpark. Sorry Tobe, but ""The Mangler"" strikes out at the plate. How could this movie possibly miss, you ask? Not only does it miss, it misses by a couple of million miles.

William Gartley (Englund) runs a laundry factory on the outskirts of some small town. He's a tyrant of a boss, prone to stalking about a catwalk that runs around the top of the factory while bellowing nonsensical insults at the put upon female workers toiling in the morass below. And the plant is a morass, full of steaming machinery that looks like it stepped right out of a Dickens novel. The centerpiece is a gigantic laundry folding apparatus, called the Hadley Watkins or some such nonsense, which systematically chews and folds humans when its not doing sheets. The first death in the factory summons the local constabulary in the form of Officer John Hutton (Ted Levine), but nothing much happens. We then follow Hutton back to his house where we meet his hippy dippy neighbor Mark Jackson (Daniel Matmor), a kook whose hobbies seem to revolve around the investigation of the supernatural. How handy! We just know Jackson's hocus pocus will serve a purpose later in the narrative, and indeed we are correct because the Hadley Watkins machine is actually a demonic force that gives power to those who feed it human sacrifices. Sigh. You know, this sounded better when Stephen King wrote the story.

""The Mangler"" lurches from one turgid scene to another, only garnering interest when we catch sight of some of the gory carnage that inevitably arises when flesh meets steel. After a few more people say bye bye thanks to the machine, Hutton gets suspicious. It helps that a flashbulb tossing crime photog by the name of J.J.J. Pictureman (Jeremy Crutchley) pops up once in awhile to capture death on film and drop a few cryptic statements about the goings on in town. Well, it doesn't help that much, mind you, but he does swing by more than a few times looking all old and shriveled up in pancake makeup that should make a real special effects artist blanche in embarrassment. There's some nonsense about a possessed refrigeration unit from the factory--or whatever that white box with fire coming out of it was--and a bunch of scenes involving Hutton beating his fists against anything he can find and raging. I don't know; nothing really makes that much sense here. We also learn that Gatley is up to no good with a certain family member. Again, I don't really know how this relates to the narrative. By the time the movie judders to a conclusion that's witnessed the Hadley stalking about the factory like some sort of steel dinosaur with a bad attitude, I was ready for a nap.

I kept thinking the studio mangled ""The Mangler"" because the movie just doesn't seem to fit together very well. Of course, that's not the only problem here. A big mistake was casting Ted Levine in the lead role. I'm not criticizing his abilities as an actor; he did a fantastic job in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" But here he just...well...doesn't inspire any believability. He's more suited to playing baddies than good guys, what with that slurry voice and all. I clucked with disapproval on several occasions when he delivered lines that should have been serious but came off sounding banal because of that voice. Englund's much better--he dances around like some malevolent metallic elf at one point--but his scenes are so few that I felt the movie could have succeeded if only he had been the primary focus. The gore is great too, with lots of quick cuts of limbs and heads being folded and pressed amidst great gushings of sauce, but again there isn't enough to make up for the myriad parts of the movie that just drag by so slowly. I find it incredible that this movie inspired two sequels, one of which is coming out in the near future. I sure hope they're better than this heap o' compost!

Incredibly, there are extras on the DVD. I don't know if there's a commentary track on the disc (I wouldn't have listened to one anyway), but I do remember the inclusion of additional gore scenes. What they did is split the screen and play the edited version on top and the extra sauce on the bottom. The cuts are quick but especially juicy in some parts. It's nothing that would have helped the film had they been included, though. I'm betting good old Tobe wishes this one would just go away. Frankly, I'd rather rewatch ""Chain Saw"" and ""Lifeforce"" than spend a second looking at this tripe again. Not recommended for anyone.",1121126400,5,5520,4.693498452012384
667585,4,6303521436,"Based on a short story by Stephen King, this film expresses the ever present and ever surviving nature of evil, hence of fear. Here the film deals with the big monsters that the big machines of the industrial age contain and represent. Machines are evil spirits that can only work if they suck on humanity, their blood, their pith and marrow, and even their spirituality. The machine is the bloody god of the modern age that requires regular human sacrifices to go on working properly. This is frightening because it is coming from a popular saying that the machine eats the worker up. It is also visually shown in the fact that the master, the owner of the machine, the one who will make a big profit from it by exploiting the work of the workers has to sacrifice a body part of himself or herself to the machine for the machine to accept to work for him or her. There is no morality in all that, in this world. There may be a desire for the world to be ethical, but this desire is nothing but a pipe dream that has absolutely no chance to be realized. Once we have committed ourselves to the god of machines, we cannot go back and even destroy these machines. The devil that is living in them will get us before we ever even try, what's more succeed in destroying it. There is no effective exorcism even with holy water and wafers and incantations in Latin. These evil spirits living in machines are beyond this because they are the pure creation of men : Man created the machine and thus provided these evil spirits that are roaming the world with a haven where they can prosper and from which they can dominate and enslave the world, even if they need some  boss  to enact and realize this domination, to the boss's profit of course, but this profit is only a delegation of power from the devil to the boss and a temporary probation for the boss who will have eventually to go back to the machine as simple fodder. This is the most disquieting vision of our free enterprise society a sane mind can imagine.

667586,3,6303521436,"When I rented this movie, the cashier commented on how bad this film was and how I was wasting my money. I took his word for it initially but rented it anyway. I would have to agree that this movie overall isn't that great, but in retrospect isn't that bad either. I've seen much worse horror ideas brought to film.

  Yeah, there's some crappy acting from this movie, mainly from the less important characters. The main players in the story do an alright job acting, making it watchable. But I thought the movie had a creepy surrealistic atmopshere that gave it quality. And I thought the actual Mangler itself pulsed with evil and wretchedness. And some the scenes where people get mangled were gory fun. Yeah, I'll admit the scene with the icebox was a little stupid, but could have been much worse. And I thought they did a very good job in the end when the Mangler started moving and actually coming after people. They did it as originally as possible without making it ridiculous. I don't think anyone else could've pulled off a giant ironing machine coming after people as well as Tobe Hooper did.

  Random Thought: When I rented this, I didn't know it was based on a Stephen King short story and through the whole film I was thinking how much it reminded me of ""Christine."" Makes sense.

  Overall, I think this film was a lot better than most people gave it credit for. I think people dismiss horror movies too easily if they don't match up to bull$@#* like the The Ring or crap like that.",1102291200,,1499,4.501845018450185

In trying to expand its merits to the screen, director Tobe Hooper finds himself with a mangled script that gets so incoherent, it becomes annoying.  Ted Levine is mysteriously miscast in the leading role, and his performance is wooden and uninspired.  Even the formidable Robert Englund seems to be playing another Freddy Kreuger.  The inclusion of the belladonna is confusing, and the ending where fingers start being lopped off comes out of nowhere.

Not one of the best King adaptations to hit the screen, but it IS far better than its ridiculous sequel.",1098144000,,673,4.964285714285714
667588,2,6303521436,"How could you possibly go wrong with a movie forged by the Holy Trinity of Terror: the inspired, deranged, ghoulish minds of Stephen King, Tobe Hooper, and Robert Englund---particularly when the subject of ""The Mangler"" is a demon-possessed industrial laundry machine ravenous for human flesh and blood?

Short answer: you can't! If your local coin-op laundromat is closed for the night, it's certainly worth your while to take your dirty clothes over to the old Bartley mill and get 'em steam-pressed.

For your time and blood money, here's what you get out of this tasty little nugget of pure bloody stupidity. SEE---

*A REAL villain---certainly not your boring, ordinary old serial killer from central casting, but a demon-possessed 19th century steam-belching industrial press laundry machine (the Hadley Watson #6, naturally). This mass murderer means business: rather than just stabbing or shooting its victims---how mundane!---it folds, spindles, and mutilates them, then considerately folds and presses them!

*The great Ted Levine (who played Buffalo Bill in ""Silence of the Lambs"") woefully miscast as a small-town Maine police detective and hero of the movie! Levine slurs every line in that trademark cross between a gargle and a whine, and I would burst out in laughter every time he talked. Funny stuff! While Levine was investigating the messy death of the portly pill-popping Mrs. Frawley, I kept waiting for him to say ""oh yeah, I remember, she was that great big fat person"".

*Daniel Matmor as a sort of poor man's Tom Conti, who proposes to ""read Leviticus"" to the demon laundry machine and engages in a scenery-chewing contest with Robert Englund and the Machine. The Machine wins.

*And of course, Robert Englund himself, cackling insanely, cracking that corporate whip, and waddling about in a kind of combination crutches-lower body exoskeleton like some a demon-possessed version of Lionel Barrymore's Old Man Potter from ""It's a Wonderful Life""!

There's a lot of material thrown into ""The Mangler""---you've got the demonic laundry machine, belladonna pills, virgin blood, ancient sacrifice, the town's power-mad aristocracy, even a contract between Englund's insane old tycoon and the Hadley-Watson #6--- served up with some nice directorial panache and stylish camera angles by Tobe Hooper. But that said, ""The Mangler"" isn't about viewing-for-comprehension: this is high-octane garbage, served up with a fine helping up gore and with a side-order of extra-rare gore. Did I mention ""The Mangler"" is gory?

Levine, despite being stamped forever as the cross-dressing serial killer Jame Gumb in my mind, is actually pretty funny to watch as the lead---you laugh at him, not with him---and he puts some rough miles on a Jeep Cherokee. Datmor plays Watson to Levine's Holmes, and overacts ferociously to the scripture-quoting finish. Englund does his snarling, drooling, leering, cackling thing, evidently has the time of his life, and gets a good tailor in the bargain. Loved the ascot and smoking jacket!

Tobe Hooper keeps up the pace, throws in some moody interiors, cobbles together a pretty ferocious man-eating laundry machine (all stamped Industrial Revolution gears and pressed black metal---brrr!), and keeps up an onslaught of mayhem as workers get pulled into the presser and you start wondering about the damage this is doing to the mill's profit margins.

Moral of the Story #1: If you want to run a profitable and worry-free industrial laundry business, it's probably not a good idea to build it around a Demonic Laundry Machine.

Moral of the Story #2: If you absolutely *must* have the Demonic Laundry Machine in your business, then don't let the virgin mill-worker bleed into the press of the Demonic Laundry Machine.

Moral of the Story #3: If you're a 16-year-old virgin mill-worker, you probably shouldn't work for Robert Englund, and at the very least you should stay far away from the Demonic Laundry Machine.

Is this a horror classic? Absolutely not. Is it enjoyable, bloody, unapologetic, trashy fun, and will you get your clothes back on Monday in time for work? You betcha! Throw this sick puppy in the hopper and let's get to pressing laundry---we're on the clock, and time is money!",1097884800,5,4237,5.213235294117647
667591,3,6303521436,"Let's just set one thing straight, The Mangler is by no means a great film, nor is it one of Stephen King's worthier ventures into moviemaking.  However, if you take it upon yourself to view this movie with no notion of pretext (and perhaps without reading the story first) you may just find it to be something you can enjoy, if only to laugh at.  Basically the premise is a laundry press, a behemoth of a machine designed to fold laundry, becomes possessed and starts killing workers at the Blue Ribbon Laundry.  The small town cop who gets to investigate the deaths begins to suspect foul play and eventually the supernatural.

Everything points to the Laundry's owner, played by Robert Englund who is amazingly unconcerned about the loss of employees.  Englund goes to town as a wreck of a human being, bound in metal leg braces and horribly disfigured who runs his business with an iron fist.  One might say that's not too much of a stretch from his most famous role but it works.

Overall this is good for those who like gore, scary small town happenstance (gee, that's not a Stephen King trademark is it?), and anything by H.P. Lovecraft.  Besides, Tobe Hooper directed this film and if you like the Horror genre that should at least pique your interest.",1096848000,5,1260,4.6441441441441444

A movie based on a good Stephen King short story (from his ""Night Shift"" collection), directed by horror meister Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Poltergeist, Salem's Lot), starring Robert ""Freddie Krueger"" Englund and Ted ""Buffalo Bill"" Levine! How could it possibly stink?? Well, it's another case of a short-short story being bloated out to fill movie time. The Mangler itself is pretty scary in the book. On film, it's just one more mechanical monster on the loose. Hooper probably did the best he could with the awful material. Englund and Levine just sort of sleepwalk through the mess. THE MANGLER will cause NO nightmares or shudders, unless you pay to see it that is...",1094774400,2,706,4.891666666666667
667593,2,6303521436,"Since apparently only lunatics are writing reviews of this DVD (not you Johhnykay), I thought I'd better chime in to offer a reasonable voice.
First thing: Stephen King has no approval regarding movies like this.  He sold off the rights long, long ago, and thus cannot control when and if they get made, much less the quality of the movies.
Second thing: this is not a good movie.  Don't make the mistake of thinking that it is.  The plot is ludicrous -- it sort of works on the page, but filmed, it is just silly.  That said, the movie is not entirely worthless.  Robert Englund is fun to watch as the factory owner, and there are a few decent sequences.  Mainly, though, I'd say the best reason to watch is for Ted Levine, in a rare starring role as the policeman trying to sort this mess out.

667594,1,6303521436,"I couldn't help but be impressed when I read the all star cast involved in this movie. Tobe Hooper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) as director, a Stephen King (The Shining) adaptation, and good 'ol freddy krueger (Robert Englund) as one of the main characters.
With these three involved I couldn't help but pick it up and give it a viewing, and get a little excited about watching it.
Unfortunately, like a lot of King movies, it falls quite short of being anything special, in fact the end result is rather mediocre considering the players involved.
Tobe Hoopers creeping claustrophobia is felt throughout the movie,
but wasn't enough to keep the movies head above water.
The acting performances were pretty ordinary, but thats almost the norm with horror movies.

667596,3,6303521436,"To disagree with another review of this gory adaption of a King short story, the movie hardly follows the story at all.  Sure, the plot elements are the same, but minor details are different.  Details just minor enough o affect the outcome of the story.  Because there's so many I'll only reveal one: Both the man characters are wifeless.  Levine's wife is dead and his pal's a bachelor.  Also, Englund' character and the pact he's made with the demon in the machine is different.  Englund's character in the book is only mentioned once or twice, and he isn't a main player in the events.  Overall repulsive, yet shockingly entertaining.

The premise is a simple one. A town's laundry press machine has a life of its own. It gobbles up the women workers there and a detective (a great Ted Levine!) is set to try and figure out what is going on. The factory owner (Robert Englund) is over the top in his performance, but he just does it so well that you enjoy it! The story from Stephen King is not that bad and there is lots of blood and suspense along the way. This is not a bad horror movie but unfortunately Matmor and his scenes are completely out-of-touch with this movie and since he is in 40% of it well we can do little more than award it two stars when we could have given it four.
