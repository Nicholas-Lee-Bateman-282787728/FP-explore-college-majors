8354921,5,B0027NDAAA,"I first purchased Bob Mann's ""Weight Training At Home Simplified"" in 1987, but it was on VHS lol. I know I am telling on my age, oh well. Bob and the young lady he is doing weights with are just great. The whole routine is about 45 minutes long, and it doesn't work you to death, it just works all the muscles. I just loved it. I have been searching for this in a DVD, FOREVER. If you can't afford a gym, this is the very next best. In fact I would much rather do his video at home with my weights, than go to a gym. I would love to meet the guy, he did such a great job. You can also do this routine with hand weights. Do yourself a favor get the DVD, you will look and feel great in weeks. Ooops, I bought the last one, well keep checking back.",1345852800,,746,3.8506493506493507
