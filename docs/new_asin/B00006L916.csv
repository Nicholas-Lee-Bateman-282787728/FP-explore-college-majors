1784061,5,B00006L916,"I am an unabashed fan of ALL Vincent Price films, as I enjoy tremendously the actor's campy romp through melodrama.  ""Shock"", from 1946, displays Price in his glory as a killer psychiatrist in love with a ruthless nurse who eggs him on in his plot to silence a woman who was a witness to his crime.
  The woman's soldier husband, freshly home from WWII and familiar with the syndrome of soldiers suffering from ""shock"", accepts Price's self-serving diagnosis of his wife.  As the plot grinds on, providing at least a laugh a minute, he slowly begins to believe his wife rather than her doctor.  Truth prevails in the end of this satisfying film, which provides the viewer with ""escape from reality"" on several levels.  Recommended!",1074643200,19,731,4.808
1784062,4,B00006L916,Loved the story! Excellent mystery and suspense thriller. An excellent plot about a woman witnessing a murder and has a break down and is commited to an asylum. I do not want to say no more it  will spoil the surprise!!!  The picture was dark and grainy and sound quality poor. I could not enjoy the picture. Lousy dvd transfer!! I agree with laurent burel's posting.  Do not buy this dvd until a better transfer comes along!!!rent it!

1784064,4,B00006L916,"The title shouts sensationalism, but the film is a straight-forward, succinctly paced noir with a minimum of the melodrama and pseudo-medical nonsense that often marks such movies.  Vincent Price's performance is understated, yet powerful, and his character's interaction with mistress Lynn Bari is chillingly intriguing.  The discovery of this drama is like coming across a gleaming onyx in a chest of gaudy paste jewelry!",1060300800,6,423,5.59375
1784065,4,B00006L916,"Shock! is an excellent example of suspense films of the 40's.  At the time, Vincent Price was doing mostly dramas and this film allowed him to have the starring role.  He did an excellent job, and it is truly suspenseful from the beginning to the very end.  I honestly thought was the villain--the truth is shocking, hence the title.
This is an excellent DVD from Alpha Video-my favorite company for the sole reason that they concentrate on releasing the old films.  My only complaint and the reason that this DVD only gets 4 stars is because there are times when the picture is rather faint and the sound gets muffled.  Other than that, the film is in great shape.
I highly recommend this film to anyone who is in the mood for a good, atmospheric suspense film from the golden age of movies.  It is a real gem and Vincent Price shines as Dr. Cross.  Go out and get it--you'll be glad you did.",1045612800,6,893,4.408536585365853

While waiting she sees Vincent Price strike and kill his wife in another room...and Jenny goes into some kind of catatonic shock...which lost me right here. As things turn out, Vincent Price is a doctor and ends up treating her.

Interesting film of an era when doctors smoked and there was a one to one nurse-patient ratio as we hear said, ""How is your patient doing?"" Nothing much to see here. Young Vincent Price who was less commanding in his presence.

1784132,5,B00006L916,"Vincent Price at his best. Price plays a psychiatric doctor, Dr. Hale, who murders his wife and conveniently it's witnessed by a young woman waiting for her husband to return from a POW camp. Of course this all happens in the same motel. The young witness's husband finds his wife in shock at the motel. Another convenience to the murdering Dr. Hale is that he he gets to treat the witness to his crime. Suspenseful and Price is so convincing as an undecided doctor who weighs conscience for his crime against the health of the witness. His mistress is there to push him to do wrong until he snaps while injecting the witness with lethal injections to rid himself of the patient's words of his guilt that the good doctor did indeed kill his wife with a candlestick.
On top of Dr. Hale's problems is a police detective at his persistent best. Exhumation reveals the cause of murder by a silver candlestick with slivers in the victim's head. The murder weapon is found and at the last minute will it be too late to save the witness? Great movie and I was on edge near the ending. The supporting cast was a weak one and Price carried the entire film--hands down. Actually, the other actors were unbelievable and I found the husband of the young wife quite weak in character and actions.

1784179,4,B00006L916,"After recently rewatching ""Shock,"" what strikes me about this movie is not so much its virtues as a film-noir, but its elements of horror. In the thunderstorm scene in particular, where the inmate breaks out of his room at the sanitarium, there is a real sense of terror. This is perhaps most evident to Vincent Price fans like myself, who value and enjoy this movie mostly for his presence in it. In typical film-noir fashion, the story involves an otherwise law-abiding citizen who becomes trapped in a downward spiral of deceit and desperation after a momentary lapse of judgment--in this case, a crime of passion (murder, to be specific). It's the only time that Vincent Price starred in a film noir, and he handles the role with aplomb.",1402617600,,741,4.796875

1784188,3,B00006L916,"It is hard to believe that Vincent Price the star of so many really, 1950s really, scary horror movies where as the evil genius behind some scheme he scared the bejesus out of many members of the generation of  '68 could actually portray in this film nothing more than a skirt -addled shrink. That is the hard reality behind this B-film thriller, Shock, from 1946. Here the evil genius, if that is the correct term, is Vincent's paramour, another in a line of cinematic nurses from hell.

Here is the skinny on why old Vincent is nothing but a skirt-addled guy. Naturally a successful psychiatrist who ran a high-end sanatorium would be away from home quite a bit and that was our boy's undoing. He, in his lonely hours, began an affair with his main nurse and wanted to divorce his wife. Problem was the wife wanted to drag his name through the mud in revenge. So Vincent solved the problem pronto he killed her in a hotel room and later disposed of the body up at the couple's lodge. But once you start down the murder row you never know what will happen. And what happened was something that old Vincent certainly would not like and that was that a young war bride waiting for her returning POW husband at that very hotel heard the scuffle that led to the murder. In reaction she froze and that mental freezing led her to come under old Vincent's care as the nearest shrink. Perfect.

Well, almost perfect. Well, not really perfect at all because despite about seven different therapeutic strategies pursued by Vincent with his nurse- lover egging him on that war bride would not fall down on her abiding conviction that Vincent had murdered, murdered most foul, his dear wife. In the end her distraught returning warrior husband began to believe her and put a stop to Vincent's dastardly campaign. Oh yah, Vincent in the end decided he had to draw the line somewhere, somewhere deep in his medical training and could not finish the war bride off. He could however finish off that evil genius of a nurse who had him skirt-addled, skirt-addled big time. Hey come to think of it you should wait until the 1950s and watch Vincent at work, let's say in something like The House Of Wax.  This one is just so-so.",1375228800,,2209,4.5566750629722925

1784190,3,B00006L916,"Clocking in at 70 minutes, Shock is shockingly short, and if it had been half an hour longer it might have been a contender, because it has some decided assets. One is a central plot line that's melodramatic but has loads of potential: A young woman waiting to be reunited with her returning POW husband witnesses a murder and goes into mental shock. The doctor chosen to attend to her is none other than the murder himself, who has a secret girlfriend on his staff who eggs him on. Through quick thinking and fortunate circumstances, the doctor manages to pass off the wife's claims as delusional. The murder victim, by the way, was the doctor's wife, whom he killed in a sudden rage, and while he manages to make her death look accidental, events cause the police to quickly reopen the case, making the doctor (and the girlfriend) more anxious than before. This has the potential for a taut thriller -- I won't belabor the argument that this is not really true noir -- and for the first half it looks as if that's what we're in for. However, the steam begins to leak out of this one quickly, the opportunity for more clever twists evaporates, and matters are resolved all too easily in the last few minutes. Still, I've gotten sidetracked, because I said this film had assets -- plural. Besides the plot potential, there's Lynn Bari as the scheming girlfriend. Also a nicely suave performance by a young Vincent Price. Some of the photography -- Price's office, the wife's hospital room at night, the hospital grounds -- are very good to stunning. But despite that great beginning, the second half of this very short film just loses its oomph far too soon and too quickly. Meh.",1358726400,,1679,4.6375838926174495

1784206,4,B00006L916,"""Shock"" is a spare 70 minutes with an abundance of entertainment value. It features Vincent Price's first onscreen murder, a contemptible femme fatale, an innocent woman in peril, and the sort of psychobabble that fascinated audiences in the 1940s. Mrs. Janet Stewart (Anabel Shaw) is anxious to see her husband Paul after his two years at war. They arrange to meet in a San Francisco hotel, but, as Janet pines away in her room, she witnesses a man murder his wife in a nearby apartment. Paul (Frank Latimore) arrives to find his wife in a catatonic state. Conveniently, a prominent psychiatrist, Dr. Richard Cross (Vincent Price), lives at the hotel. He recommends that Janet be moved to his private sanitarium for treatment. Unbeknownst to Paul, Dr. Cross is the man who committed the murder that sent his wife into a state of shock.

This is a compact little B-noir with elements of woman-in-peril and evil psychiatrist plots as well. The psychiatrist's disposition is not so simple, actually, as Dr. Cross is enticed by his amoral nurse and lover Elaine Jordan (Lynn Bari) into using all means at his disposal to silence Janet. His lack of scruple has limits; Elaine's does not. Bari shows real spark as an irredeemable spider woman. If ""Shock"" has a flaw, it's that its heroine, Janet, is unconscious most of the time, and husband Paul is absent most of the time. But Price and Bari easily carry the film with strong characterizations that evoke more emotional response than the victim or heroes do. Joe MacDonald, always adept with low key lighting, contributes some cinematography here, along with Glen MacWilliams. ""Shock"" doesn't have much depth, but a talented cast and creative team make it better than its budget might imply.

The DVD (Fox 2006): The sole bonus feature is a voluble and occasionally over-dramatic audio commentary by John Stanley, former host of San Francisco's ""Creature Feature"" series. He's a huge fan of Vincent Price's later career as the king of low-budget horror flicks. Stanley comments very little on the film itself but instead provides lengthy biographical essays on the cast, even the bit players, and on the film's production history. He also quotes from an interview he did with Vincent Price. It's an informative commentary but not an analysis of the film. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish.",1275264000,,2392,4.992481203007519

But it looked good enough to see if there was a better copy of it out there and there IS.
Fox Film Noir has produced a crisp, clear copy of this film. Also included are trailers for other Fox Film Noir: Boomerang!,House of Strangers,Laura,I Wake Up Screaming,Vicki and Where the Sidewalk Ends.
Vincent Price is excellent in Shock as the psychiatrist/doctor who slays his wife so he can be with his lover-on a full time basis. Only trouble is the slaying is witnessed by a woman played by Anabel Shaw, who reminded me of actress Emma Watson.
There is a good dream sequence and good acting by Shaw and Lynn Bari as the sexy and conniving love interest.
Just wanted to add one observation and that is language that is becoming extinct and is used several times in this film(as I'm sure in many other pictures of the period). To wit, when a character in the movie thanks someone, you will hear replied from the other person ""Not at all"". I just find it interesting and wanted to mention this rarely used expression.
After you've watched the film you can re-watch it with a special commentary by film writer and historian John Stanley.
And I mean a THOUROUGH commentary as John delves into EVERYONE associated with this film-the producer,screenwriter,composer,director and each of the actors/actresses appearing in the film.
His knowledge of this film and of the actors who appear and his overall discussion of film past and present was very impressive and all served with a bit of humor as well.
Very good movie, excellent acting, a clutch of trailers from the period and John Stanleys' commentary make this a happy purchase.
The dvd box also contains a very nice 4 page booklet with 3 memorable photographs from the film and 4 short essays discussing different aspects of the film:""The Lineup"", ""The Look"", ""The Story"" and ""The Scoop"".",1271116800,,2041,4.768361581920904

""Shock"" really refers to the treatment that the metal patient undergoes in the story (rather than something that ""shocks"" the audience- which is what the title would infer today). Being a fan of Fox Film Noir, I kind of knew what I was getting into when I bought the DVD. I mainly bought this because I was curious about other films that Lynn Bari made (other than the musicals which I was familiar with including, ""Hello Frisco Hello"" and my favorite, ""Sun Valley Serenade""). Yes, this film is a bottom of the double feature bill sort of movie but enjoyable nonetheless.  Vincent Price is not yet the ""Vincent Price"" we have come to know and love in the horror genre but entertaining and certainly charming in his Vincent Price sort of way.

1784211,4,B00006L916,"""Shock"" is a stark and creepy piece of moody melodrama from 1946, starring the wonderful Vincent Price as a psychiatrist caught in a snare of his own making.

The film opens with a young woman checking into a San Francisco hotel to meet her husband who is finally home from the war. While waiting she sees a man in an adjacent room kill his wife in a fit of rage. The woman promptly goes into shock. When the young soldier gets to the hotel, he finds his wife with wide eyes and unable to communicate. He rings for a doctor who refers the case to an eminent psychiatrist who happens to be the murderer.

Price admits her to his private sanitarium and sedates her while conditioning her to believe that what she saw was a figment of her imagination. He almost succeeds with the help of his mistress, but the soldier is very persistent in trying to help his wife. He enlists the help of another psychiatrist who, with the help of the police, is able to free the fragile, sedated wife. In the end Price also loses his temper with his mistress, and is ultimately led off to meet justice.

Certainly parts of the film are a bit contrived, but the acting is quite good, the script is tight (the film is only 70 minutes long), and the high-contrast black and white photography is excellent. My only complaint about the film is that the soundtrack is a bit muddled, and a few lines of dialogue are a bit difficult to understand.

This is an excellent example of mid 1940s film production, and I recommend it.",1220054400,4,1500,4.423913043478261

1784223,3,B00006L916,"Film noir sells. As a product category and a genre (in real world, rather than academic, terms) it possibly outsells all others except new releases. So, if movie companies can possibly package a product under a noir imprimatur, you bet they're going to do it, because it will maximize sales.

Meanwhile, movie critics and academics specializing in film noir are complicit in the matter since they've classified far too many movies as film noir, and spun rather farfetched, tortuously worded theories to support their aggrandizing notions.

As it happens, ""Shock"" is a rather tawdry thriller-horror film that has nothing to do with film noir, but which, nevertheless, is interesting if not terribly effective. It may become somewhat more compelling in your mind if you remind yourself that a real life medical monster was active and running around the country during this period, promoting his new procedure: pre-frontal lobotomy, which he performed quickly and often rather casually using ice picks. It would have been very interesting had Hollywood decided to produce a bio-pic of Dr. Walter Freeman, and chosen Vincent Price to play the leading role.",1203638400,4,1152,5.221621621621622

1784228,2,B00006L916,"The only way to enjoy this film is not to have read the plot synopsis of spoilers that amazon has included as production notes.  Having never heard of this alleged noir, I decided to buy it because it contains a commentary track.

For starters, it's no more a noir film than is any Minelli musical:  the hero trapped by fate is toothlessly developed; a surreal dream sequence does not automatically a noir make; the Wonder Bread cast is given no punchy dialogue; and (except for some nightgown shots in a doorway) the picture is photographed by TWO cinematographers with little visual muscle.  Price and Bari in this period are always fun to spend time with, but they're capable of so much more than this pic asks of them.  Not horrible, but only if you don't read the plot beforehand.

The commentary gets at best a generous ""C"" grade. Granted, this movie is no masterpiece so there's not a whole lot to dissect.  When the voice-over concentrates on brief bio backstories, it's far more interesting than, say, the NYU professor whose commentary for BULLETS OR BALLOTS is peppered with the phrase ""as I've already said before....""  But the SHOCK commentator pads most of the unreeling by reading an apparent article he wrote about having met Price late in the actor's life and pestering the poor man about his ""Price of Fear"" reputation.  As this reading drones on, one is curious to hear about what's actually going on in the movie--notably bio data on mad Mrs. Penny, and the bizarrely suggestive body language in a park bench scene between the homicidal doctor and the patient's husband.

There's a reason no one's ever heard of this movie.  Not worth the trouble.",1163980800,7,1667,4.753472222222222
1784229,4,B00006L916,"I debated whether to give this film three or four stars.  It doesn't to my mind qualify as noir more like pulp fiction.  It's watchable but by no means classic.  I give ""Shock"" the pass because of the superb performance by Vincent Price.  Yes, his Dr. Cross commits some horrific things in the film.  Essentially though he is a decent, albeit weak, man driven to these acts through events out of his control namely his comely head nurse(Lynn Bari).  Don't expect the Price of the Grade Z horror films that he later churned out.  This is a performance of great understatement and depth.  I don't think that the film's primary setting, Price's sanitarium, was fully exploited for it's chill factor.  What did get my spine tingling was it's portrayal of archaic psychotherapy namely the insuline shock treatments Price administers to the G.I.'s wife (Anabel Shaw) in his efforts to silence her.",1157932800,2,891,4.847682119205298
1784230,4,B00006L916,"From the Fox Noir series comes Shock (1946), a dark, entertaining little film featuring Vincent Price (The Fly, The Tingler, The Abominable Dr. Phibes) and Lynn Bari (Charlie Chan in City in Darkness, The Amazing Mr. X).  Directed by Alfred L. Werker (He Walked by Night), the film also features Anabel Shaw (Home, Sweet Homicide, Gun Crazy), Frank Latimore (The Razor's Edge), Stephen Dunne (The Dark Past), and Charles Trowbridge (Valley of the Zombies).

As the film begins we see a woman named Janet Stewart (Shaw) checking into a San Franciscan hotel with the intent on meeting her husband Paul (Latimore), a lieutenant in the military who's been missing for the past couple years, only recently rescued from a POW camp, or something like that.  Anyway, while anxiously awaiting the arrival of husband (two years is a long time to go without any action, and I should know), Janet witnesses a murder from her balcony as a man across the way bludgeons his wife to death during a heated argument.  When Paul finally arrives, he finds his wife in a state of shock, unable to move or speak, presumably brought on by that which she witnessed earlier.  The hotel doctor is called in, but seeing Janet's condition as something out of his league, he refers her to another hotel resident, a specialist in this sort of thing, named Dr. Richard Cross (Price), who also happens to be the same man Janet witnessed clubbing his now dead wife.  Richard, quickly realizing the cause Janet's catatonic state, recommends she be taken to his private sanitarium for further `treatment'.  Upon their arrival at the sanitarium we meet a nurse in attendance, one named Elaine Jordan (Bari), who happens to also be Richard's girlfriend (and the cause of the spat between Richard and his now dead wife).  After getting Elaine up to speed on current events (she seems unusually cool about everything), she and Richard begin making plans to not only take care of the body of Richard's now deceased wife, but to also deal with the only witness to the crime who ain't saying much in her current state, but represents a real threat that when the shock wears off, she'll most likely spill the beans.

I enjoyed this film a lot, especially the performances by both Price and Bari, both of which represented the main strength of the feature, in my opinion.  I've always been a fan of Vincent Price, particularly his ability to take on a role and make it seem believable.  I found it very easy to buy off on the pretense of his being an eminent physician in the psychiatric field, one who specialized in disorders of the mind.  I'm generally used to his more garish and over-the-top performances as in his later, straight up horror features, so it was interesting seeing him in an early, more restrained role, comparatively speaking (either way he's fun to watch).  I thought Ms. Bari, who's displayed more prominently than Price on the DVD case artwork, also did a wonderful job, and I'm not just saying that because I'm partial to spicy brunettes.  Her character was a subtly wicked piece of work, along with being extremely easy on the eyes, and it was easy to see how someone might go to such extremes in an effort to maintain a relationship with her (I don't know that I'd commit murder for her, but I might consider maiming someone for her affections).  One really interesting element with the two characters was how Richard often felt the pangs of remorse or regret for his `un-Hippocratic' behavior, only to find a certain amount of appeasement from Elaine, who was driven by only one, encompassing desire, to be with Richard free and clear, no matter what had to be done to ensure the safety of the relationship (further cementing my belief that women are truly evil).  As far as Shaw and Latimore's characters, they start off well enough, but their characters quickly fall into the realm of one dimensionality once the screenplay properly introduces Price's character.  I thought there were some real opportunities to make them into more that what they were, but it wasn't to be especially given the film runs a mere 70 minutes and it seems more or less a showcase for Price.  Sometimes I gripe about a film running too long, containing extraneous and unnecessary material, but in this case I think it was the opposite.  There seemed a number of areas that could have been more developed (a couple of the characters, the disposition of Richard's wife's body, the subsequent police investigation, the horror of being stuck in a mental institution run by someone who knows you witnessed them murdering someone else, etc.).  All in all the production values were decent enough, the direction capable, the key performances wonderful, but the screenplay seemed less than it could have been, resulting in a moderately solid film that could have been a whole lot more.  Regardless, it's worth checking out, especially if you're a fan of Price.

The picture, presented in fullscreen (1.33:1), comes across very clean and clear, and the Dolby Digital audio, available in both English mono and stereo and Spanish mono, sounds wonderful.  As far as special features there's an entertaining commentary track by film writer and historian John Stanley, liner notes, subtitles in both English and Spanish, and trailers for other features including Boomerang! (1947), Fourteen Hours (1951), House of Strangers (1949), I Wake Up Screaming (1941), Laura (1944), Vicki (1953), and Where the Sidewalk Ends (1950).
