8058705,3,B0009A40DE,"I have never cared so little about any movie character as for this movie. The characters were poorly developed thus limiting our understanding of their actions. Their story is sweet yes, but uninteresting. Two childhood friends, both with their own problems, try to help each other, somewhat unbelievably fall in love and try to move forward. Joaquin has depression, yet this is so poorly illustrated that he kindles barely any empathy from the viewer. Mara, well, she just needs to grow up. Honestly, it is not that good. i gave it three stars because it was entertaining for a while but it left no lasting effect.",1211932800,,615,4.811320754716981
8058706,2,B0009A40DE,"La trama de esta pelicula fue muy poco convincente para mi gusto. Se trata de un chico que queda traumado despues de que su madre se va de la casa y su amiguita/novia tambien se va de viaje sin despedirse. No se, a mi me parece que la relacion entre el trauma y los acontecimientos que provocan el trauma, estan muy fuera de proporcion.
Lo mas divertido de esta pelicula fue el personaje de Alfredo Casero.",1197590400,,406,4.355263157894737
8058707,4,B0009A40DE,"Pretty Argentine film with the usually cool Adrian Suar playing a lonely man, isolated, full of complexes... until beautiful Leticia Bredice comes back...
Good for latin cinema lovers, Argentine movie fans, sensitive Spaniards. I really enjoyed it!",1181606400,,248,5.72972972972973
8058708,3,B0009A40DE,"This is a nice cultural study of a cross section of upper middle class porteo society and of the symptoms of depression--and in the case of Leticia Brdice's character--personality disorder. It's a bit uneven as a drama, but does offer some good grist for the psychotherapy technique mill as we see the psychologist working with the main male character perform a number of provocative therapeutic techniques. (I happen to think it's too heavy on the confrontation and poorly performed when using paradox, but that's my opinion).

The drama is a bit uneven, though, and so unless you're really into the cultural, linguistic and psychotherapeutic aspects of the movie, which are rich, you might be let down.",1178928000,,704,5.068965517241379

Protagonizan: Adrian Suar y Leticia Bredice

Dirigida por: Daniel Barone

Esta pelcula es una gran obra de arte que vence todos los rumores y comentarios que las pelculas Latino-Americanas estn de baja calidad. Con la ausencia de efectos audio-visuales ostentosos, esta pelcula nos cuenta de un hombre que se encuentra seriamente emocionalmente incapacitado. Debido a los acontecimientos de su infancia, Joaqun (Adrian Suar) se transforma en un ermitao intil enbarricado en su dormitorio. Adrian Suar protagoniza el personaje maravillosamente del joven en sus 32 aos que es consumido por su propio miedo y sufrimiento, as, haciendo su peor enemigo. Su mejor amistad de su infancia y vecina, Mara (Leticia Bredice) regresa despus de ocho aos de estudios y esperanza de lograr exito como actriz. Su amistad y cario ayuda a Joaqun superar sus tinieblas y egosmo, donde l comienza a realizar que ser un camino largo de la terapia, al cual l no habia respondido, para la recuperacin. Todos los artistas actuaron muy bien en esta pelcula y hay algunos momentos muy divertidos y comicos en el hospital de pacientes mentales en donde Joaqun conoce a otros pacientes y hace un nuevo amigo. La historia ocurre en Argentina pero no se ve mucho de los paisajes hermosos del pais. El acento de Argentina es muy evidente y el uso de nuestra lengua Espaola es hermoso y elocuente. Nunca he entendido completamente la gente con desventajas emocionales o mentales y sta es una vista muy buena a lo qu le sucede a la gente que sufre momentos traumticos en sus vidas y cmo el sufrimiento se manifiesta, superando totalmente a los pacientes. En fin, esto es una buena pelcula sobre la familia, la amistad, y los muchos obstculos en la vida que debemos superar para seguir adelante.",1147910400,8,1781,4.910299003322259

8058711,5,B0009A40DE,"i watched this movie last night, first in all spanish without subtitles (even tho my spanish is horrible), then later with subtitles. you could do nothing but listen to it, and still see the beauty that exists in this film. i loved watching the story of the 2 characters unfold, and all the people around him. going thru the story, my mind played out dozens of reasons for his anger, countless suggestions as to why things happened the way they did.

watching this movie was a gift. i highly recomend it to any person who wants to see (or hear!) a story of immense beauty, love, loss, and life.",1126828800,12,594,4.4495412844036695
8058712,5,B0009A40DE,"El D&iacute;a que me amen (WHEN SOMEBODY LOVES ME) is an important film from Argentina that bravely examines the spectrum of the effects of 'abandonment' in childhood and how that seemingly minor act can transform lives.  Based on a story idea by lead actor Adri&aacute;n Suar and written for the screen by Marcos Carnevale and Marcela Guerty, this powerful movie steps beyond conventional tales of the distancing of childhood friends and moves into the arena of mental dysfunction and the long road to healing.

Joaqu&iacute;n (Adri&aacute;n Suar) and Mara (Leticia Br&eacute;dice) are first seen as early 30s young adults, though their intimate childhood companionship is sensitively shown in flashbacks that appear like old home movies.  Mara is an actress who has been traveling the world searching for a career and finally returns to Argentina for a chance to appear in a musical production of 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'.  Mara is beautiful, talented, but a bit emotionally blurred, having left her fianc&eacute; in Spain just before their wedding.  While her return is strained at first (she is forced to break in to her own home because her mother  forgot she was arriving!), her mother Elvira (Mar&iacute;a Rosa Fugazot) and friends are happy she has returned after an 8-year absence.

Mara is eager to see her childhood friend Joaqu&iacute;n who lives nearby, but there is a strange ambience about his household:  Joaqu&iacute;n has not left his room for two years, living in near silence in the dark, an obviously damaged young man.  His father Ignacio (Juan Leyrado) is compassionate but feels  Joaqu&iacute;n should be admitted to a psychiatric clinic.  Joaqu&iacute;n pleads to stay at home and Ignacio agrees as long as his therapist doctor  Balbis (Jorge Marrale) visits him daily.

When Mara first sees Joaqu&iacute;n she is visibly disturbed, senses his problems, and begins to urge him out of his self-confinement.  Slowly the two friends reveal each other's etiologies for maladjustment to life: Joaqu&iacute;n never recovered being abandoned first by his ill mother and second by Mara's abrupt leaving Argentina for her career, and Mara still is wounded by being abandoned by her father as a child and her failure to form lasting bonds with men.  By opening  memories and ultimately places outside Joaqu&iacute;n's house where they shared the intense bonding of their childhood each begins to heal: Mara has a successful evening as the star of her musical and regains her wounded self respect and Joaqu&iacute;n (with the incredibly fine help of therapist Balbis) shows he is shedding his pain of abandonment and growing toward a normal existence - these two factors set the stage for the film's conclusion.

Director Daniel Barone  takes this fragile tale and molds it into one of the more tender and touching films about the impact of childhood's 'tragedies' that has been stated to date. The cinematography by Guillermo Zappino never forgets for a moment the dark tones underlying the lives of each of the characters.  But the film would never have been so exacting and splendid were it not for the powerful performances by  Adri&aacute;n Suar and the extraordinarily beautiful and gifted  Leticia Br&eacute;dice ('Nine Queens', 'Burnt Money', 'Ashes from Paradise' etc).  The supporting cast is equally and homogeneously outstanding.  This is one of those films that lingers in the mind, seeking stimuli for remembering our own demons of childhood, long after the credits are over.  In Spanish with English subtitles, 110 minutes.  Very Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, July 05",1122768000,29,3604,5.213541666666667
