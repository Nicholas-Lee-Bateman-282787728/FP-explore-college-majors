6854773,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"""...Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared,"" or ""Hundraringen som klev ut genom fnstret och frsvann,"" whichever suits you best. This entry from Sweden (English captions when necessary) is my first rave review from the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival. This black, black comedy played to a packed house; it generated howls of laughter throughout, then thunderous applause when it ended. Some of us laughed all the way home on the bus, too.

Director Felix Herngren crafted a brilliant script along with Hans Ingemansson, which was based on Jonas Jonasson's novel about a Zelig-type fellow who loves blowie uppie stuff. Over the course of this hilarious film, we see him with General Franco of Spain, Josef Stalin, Harry Truman, Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer of the Manhattan Project, Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan and others I failed to note at the time.

The movie starts when his beloved cat is killed by a fox...which he promptly blows up, and it goes on from there. The marvelous script unfolds in a logical way, it just sounds so unlikely!

We follow:
  * Robert Gustafsson as Allan Karlsson (brilliant award-winning makeup!), as he ages from a young man who suffers an unfortunate surgery to a very elderly man who loves aquavit or vodka. He has a very simplistic world view and tends to let the big issues roll right off his back.
  * Iwar Wiklander as Julius, the cordial fellow who helps our hero with his unwieldy suitcase (you should see how he came by THAT!) and dispose of that pesky corpse.
  * David Wiberg is Benny, a perpetual student who never finishes anything he starts. He needs a firm hand.
  * Mia Skringer is Gunilla, who has a very firm hand (and an elephant)!
  * We also have a terrific supporting cast: a law enforcement officer trying to make sense of the case; an infuriated mob boss demanding that suitcase (if only his thugs could find it!); that other corpse in Djibouti; the elephant who sits on a gunman; plus numerous other lowlifes, thugs and molls.

Little touches, like the music's exact match to Allan's footsteps, the cars and clothes that perfectly suit each time period, the senior discount for the bus ticket. It goes on and on....

6854791,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"Why are the best movies on amazon near consistently in foreign languages? I really like to listen to my entertainment while I do other productive things, and it's really difficult to find a good show or movie entirely in english, making me stop what I'm doing and read. Minor complaint, and likely the fault of Hollywood refusing to give original ideas any traction.  At this rate I should just switch careers and become a linguist.",1507766400,,432,4.76
6854792,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"This is absurdist comedy at its best.

Robert Gustafsson is 49 years old in this film, portraying a 100-year-old man, Allan, who knows there is more to life than a retirement home birthday celebration and escapes out his room's window still wearing his wrap-around robe.  The coins in his pocket only allow him to purchase a bus ride to nearby Byringe, a small village west of Stockholm, Sweden. When a young tattoed man asks him to watch his roller luggage at the bus station because it doesn't fit in the small latrine he has to use, and the bus for Byringe arrives promptly thereafter, Allan decides to take the roller luggage with him to Byringe so as to not miss his bus. He doesn't realize what is inside the luggage.  Thus begins a big adventure of ridiculous laughs and misadventures that include recollections of Allan's life fighting for Franco in Spain, meeting President Truman and later Stalin in Soviet Russia, where he is sent to a labor camp where he meets Albert Einstein's idiot brother Herbert.

The story is absurd, but not once does Allan get depressed or use his age against him.  He loves blowing things up and that pays off in the end.  Fortune is on his side as he slowly gets away from what society expects of him and he settles down with three other outcasts: Julius (the bus station attendant), Bernie and Gunilla and elephant Sonja which is acted by three different animals.  Revealing anything more would spoil the plot.  There is some violence and cussing, but in the end it's about these outcasts telling the rest of the world to sit back and enjoy their luck and not to let society dictate to them how they should live.  Bravo!",1507680000,,1660,4.619047619047619

6854799,5,B00Q5NNMEW,Now I understand why it has such high ratings. Highly entertaining. You have to allow a little creative licence with the historical references but it makes for a wonderful story.,1504742400,,178,4.966666666666667
6854800,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"loved this! great story, wonderful charactors",1504051200,,45,6.666666666666667
6854801,3,B00Q5NNMEW,"Life is an adventure, especially if you make it one.  This Swedish dark comedy is fun and interesting, it is worth a watch but it is just okay in my opinion.  I would watch it again if someone wanted to watch it, but would not go out of my way to watch it again.",1503964800,,262,3.8333333333333335
6854802,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"Delightful, enchanting, wonderfully written, perfectly cast. A super silly romp with an uplifting message. And anyone who has lived in or visited Sweden will recognize the sweet authenticity of the setting and characters. I love the self-deprecating humor, the apt absurdity and the simple wisdom of it all.",1503705600,,307,5.416666666666667
6854803,2,B00Q5NNMEW,"I love watching movies with subtitles, and I'm very comfortable with profanity and with bizarre, absurd behavior. What I couldn't take about this movie was the terrible old-man makeup globbed like plaster on an actor who was obviously no older than about 50, and a robust, athletic 50 at that. Because of the stupid-looking, distracting makeup on an actor who could climb out windows and run, I could not for a second believe that that character was a real human being.

If a movie is centered on an unbelievable character it just doesn't work for me. What the character DOES can be completely absurd, but who that character IS just has to seem real for a movie to work. A movie titled The 100-Year-Old Man cannot work unless it's possible to believe that the man is 100 years old.",1503187200,,781,4.618705035971223

6854806,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"Kind of boring at beginning, cause I really watched many Forrest Gump type movies.
But it really got better and fascinating with forwarding of the story, both in the past line and real time line.

6854810,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"The best way to describe this movie is that its a bit like Forrest Gump if Gump were five times more funny, less melodramatic and much more inclined towards pyromania.  This is the most fantastic comedy I've seen in ages.  At the same time, it has its darkness about it.  It really shows what a messed up time and place the twentieth century was via Allen just sort of moseying through it.  Everyone should watch this movie.",1500768000,,424,4.467532467532467

6854812,5,B00Q5NNMEW,A good giggle from the beginning to the end. This movie was reminiscent of Fellini and even the sound track sounded like Nino Rota. I most heartily recommend this charming black comedy for curing the blues,1499817600,,205,4.722222222222222

6854820,3,B00Q5NNMEW,What the heck!! The best part of the book was left out! Mrs. Einstein tied everything nicely and now she has a 30 second role in the movie. Did the director even read the book? I want to give it a 5 star so badly but whoever said the script stuck to the book apparently didn't read it either.,1497312000,,292,3.9661016949152543

6854823,5,B00Q5NNMEW,Absolutely Brilliant,1496966400,,20,9.5
6854824,1,B00Q5NNMEW,I didn't find the movie funny at all. I skipped a few times to finish it. The plot is way too unrealistic. Bombing and killing people and that's ok? I don't buy it.,1496793600,,164,4.0
6854825,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"Dictators, history at a satirical level if you pay attention to many subtle nuances that speak volumes all wrapped-up inside a centurion who still has the same zeal for life and adventure receiving great luck through happenstance as he did since birth.  To shout is his beginning and to shout as our human form does this under all sort of circumstances of expression.  Yes, this is somewhat dark humor wrapped up neatly with whimsy; thus letting you laugh.  Gustafsson is a great straight man in his role as the lead comedian, so-to-speak.",1496620800,,539,4.836956521739131

6854828,1,B00Q5NNMEW,"Why did I watch this boring, painful film to the end?  Was there a plot?  A good guy?  A bad guy? Was there a message?  Was it even funny?  NO to all these questions.  What role did the elephant play?  Where was the romance?  Where did the money come from?  How did everyone find a plane to Fiji?  Final comment: Ugh! My wife can't believe I made her sit through this.  I now owe here.  She will never let me select another movie.  I don't blame her.",1496102400,,450,4.0344827586206895
6854829,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. So unique, so heartwarming, with that typical Swedish-European charm. Thank you Amazon for making this available!
I have read the book and liked it, but it was a bit slow at times. The movie does a great job of distilling its essence and making it an entertaining experience to watch.",1495929600,,325,4.52542372881356

6854831,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"A chaotic, unbelievable movie with some truly hilarious moments.

Warning: the language can be pretty rough, even with subtitles, and there is plenty of blood and gore.

But the understated Swedish reactions to truly preposterous events made me laugh out loud almost every single time.

I was an exchange student to Sweden in high school so the Swedish angle appealed to me as another reason to watch it. Had no idea what to expect and my husband even watched with me.

We watched it based on the high ratings other viewers gave it and what looked like  interesting involvement in various historical events on the part of the main character. The historical tie ins pretty much made the movie, a lot of the current day scenes were only mildly interesting and often included a lot of pretty vulgar language especially scenes with the thugs. Cute idea for a movie, cut out the bad language, the scenes with thugs running around in their underwear cussing their heads off (are those the only words in their vocabulary?), and I would give it 4 stars. Oh yeah, and be prepared for subtitles- most of the dialogue is in Swedish.",1486598400,,661,4.64957264957265

A brilliant movie about a restless retired man sets out on an adventure of whatever happens, with many flashbacks on how his passive life had made significant impacts throughout history. Dialogue is entirely in Swedish (with English subtitles), with story narration in English. (The captions, however, were difficult to read at times with lighter backgrounds.)

6855272,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"What an intoxicatingly wonderful film!  It was a Swedish 'Forrest Gump'.  I hate hype about films,  but this one far exceeded all the hype.  In short,
a series of random events cause the lead character to live a fantastic life beyond a mere mortals wildest dreams. Wow!  Watch it now.",1483056000,,284,4.6
6855273,3,B00Q5NNMEW,"This film has good qualities:  1. It takes its elderly principals seriously, 2. It is basically accepting of the people the principals encounter, even when they are jerks, and 3. it tries hard to be funny rather than make fun of anyone.  Nevertheless, it is not funny, it just tries hard.  Perhaps there is a cultural difference, it is a Swedish film after all, that I cannot bridge. Yet during my long life of film watching I have laughed at films from many other countries, including ones that were far more distant culturally than Sweden is from the USA.  Still, I would recommend it because not many films are made about the very elderly where they are appreciated the way they are here.",1483056000,,691,4.59349593495935

6855278,5,B00Q5NNMEW,If you have the time to watch this movie and enjoy foreign films then this is a good one to watch. It does have a slow but intricate plot and the characters ramble a little bit do to old age but it is clever and the more that you get into it the more you see the colors of each character come to life. Also enjoy movies that have a happy ending.,1483056000,,345,3.8055555555555554

The best part of the movie though is when he recounts his past adventures.  Somewhat like Forest Gump.  Oh and he has a passion for blowing things up.  Lots of fun!,1482883200,,316,4.421052631578948

6855320,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"Although I enjoyed the ""Old Man,"" I was sometimes just a little confused.

As a result, although I understood and was amused by most of the historical references, I didn't have a clue how some of the characters fit into the story.

6855426,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"Interesting movie, unique. Almost like a twist on a Forest Gump style, (in its own way) tho the storyline is totally different; maybe it's his seeming ignorance or innocence as one thing after the other happens as he's just living.

The plot quickly builds up speed and then goes headlong down a path filled with explosions, attempted murder, cold war espionage, and international travel. The cast is perfect for their roles  all pretty low-key and convincing in a basically outlandish tale. Similar (but a bit heavier) films that come to mind are: ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Forrest Gump,"" and ""The Big Lebowski,"" in terms of sensibility and plotting.",1480636800,,729,5.222222222222222

I would have fast forwarded through the 100-year old man too if I could have. When Allan was a child and his mother was dying (his father had already died), she told him not to think so much about things, just let them happen.  And that's what he did.  And things turned out okay.  I like that premise, and it was well illustrated in the movie.  However, I just got bored and wanted it to end before it did end.  It's a long movie.

++ good acting - all the central characters play their roles quite professionally
++ camera work and filming are OK
++ there are instances of pleasant ""white"" humor

Things we didn't like very much
------------------------------------------
-- a lot of black humor
-- some dirty language
-- a lot of drinking everywhere
-- some very silly turns of the plot - like Einstein in a Russian jail

6855792,5,B00Q5NNMEW,I loved this movie about the life and adventures of the 100 year old man who climbed out of his Nursing Home window.  It took awhile to get used to reading the subtitles because the movie was in the Swedish language.  It was extremely comical because this man hated politics but was continuously involved with wars in many different countries because he was an expert at making bombs and blowing things up.  The movie is for adults only because of the inappropriate swearing by the story characters.,1469836800,,499,4.712643678160919

6855834,5,B00Q5NNMEW,This movie was like The Big Lebowski but with an old Swedish guy instead of the Dude and subtitles. If you liked the Big Lebowski and you like subtitles - this is your movie.,1468800000,,174,4.147058823529412

6855842,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"I see that all the really negative reviews compare this movie to the book. Seeing these reviews I got the book out of the library.  Yes the book is terrific, but trying to duplicate the book in film would result in a 12 episode mini-series. Lots of good stuff has been eliminated and in the book Alan is cleverer than in the movie, but the movie is wonderful in its own right.  They are different, I get that, but I thoroughly enjoyed both.",1468713600,,440,4.289156626506024

6855846,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"Since I enjoyed the book, I was afraid the movie would fall short. Instead, what a delightful surprise! And frankly, it's much easier to follow the many characters and twists and turns and jumps backward and forward in time when it rolls before your eyes. Casting and acting is right on...I wasn't disappointed in anyone. This is a very witty romp.",1468627200,,348,4.721311475409836
6855847,3,B00Q5NNMEW,"Foreign Film, with English subtitles. Funny while at the same time absurd and disjointed. Several story lines not all clearly joined together. Good to contribute to a non-brainer evening of TV watching.",1468627200,,202,5.34375

Loved the premise and the flashbacks in the old man's life. Hilarious! The only thing that spoiled the movie  was that the subtitles were hard for me to read, the white print against the light backgrounds.

6855858,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"This movie is a gem! It's about a man who lived a Zelig-like life, moving socially & professionally in a wide range of circles, and he loved to blow things up. Eventually he ends up in a retirement home, but escapes on his 100th birthday. We learn his history while he has adventures, meets new people, does outrageous things involving biker guys, stolen money, an old station master, a rich guy connected to the bikers, and a woman with a farm, a bus & an elephant. He is halfheartedly followed by a local cop, for disappearing from the nursing home. At times wistful, sometimes hugely funny, occasionally almost shocking in his matter-of-fact reactions to extreme events, the movie is never boring.

I generally do not like subtitles; but they did not detract at all from my movie-enjoyment-experience. This is one of the finest, best crafted movies I have ever seen. When I was a member of the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE), we were told while rating a film to notice at what point we became completely interested in the outcome of the movie. If that did not happen by at least the first 10 minutes; it was probably not going to be a very good film. I knew this was going to be a memorable film in the first 3 minutes. What a fabulous dark comedy! I saw this free on Amazon Prime; but I will now buy the DVD for my permanent collection. I can easily see this film used as an example of quality film crafting in film schools around the world. It deserves SIX stars!",1466726400,,877,4.289156626506024

But at nearly two hours, I think there's enough in there...no one wants this to be LotR with a 100 year old and an elephant.  This movie is every bit as charming and enjoyable as the book, and you needn't have read the book to enjoy it.  Just prepare for two things: despite the fact that the trailer is English, most of the movie is in Swedish, so unless you're fluent, you'll be reading subtitles.

6856208,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"Very enjoyable film.  I suggest you watch it on larger screen, I watched on a tablet which made reading the sub-titles a little harder to see.  In a nutshell I'd call it the Swedish version of Forest Gump, except this guy likes to blow stuff up.  Same basic premise, a guy bumbling through life (although a long life) meeting and interacting with famous people, having an effect on history.  Good for a rainy day or a long flight.",1463529600,,430,4.4743589743589745

6856214,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"Delightfully quirky characters!  Oddly, I enjoyed the movie more than the book.  This movie kept up a high level of anticipation throughout.

The movie starts wherein you see him escaping from a retirement home on his 100th birthday and the fun starts from there. Even-though most of the dialogues were in a foreign Swedish language but the English subtitles made it easy for me to follow the fun. Please note: not that you need the subtitles since the characters and their acts were so funny thru out the movie that you do not even need subtitles :)

The past is much more amusing and a bit reminiscent of a Woody Allen style or even a Forrest Gump quality. The current day was goofy and a little too intricate to work well on the screen. I believe it was adapted from a novel. There was a lot of production value behind this film but the flow stumbled and stopped the interest in forward motion.,1461542400,,443,4.349397590361446

I can't really say why except that the humor comes off better with visual rather than merely words.  Perhaps it was the translation of the book that lessened my enjoyment.  Translations almost always lose something; perhaps if I could have read Swedish I'd have enjoyed the book more. I thought that the direction and the acting were well done.  I enjoyed both the broad humor and the more subtle humor.  The irony, which did not come across well for me in the book, was clear and well done (although irony really should be subtle).

What this movie is full of, however, is loads of dry Scandinavian humor.  I won't give anything away, but a 100 year old man gets bored and wanders away from a retirement home, attracts the angry attention of some criminals, and meets some new friends while traveling.  He meets amusing characters in the movie, and the 100 year old man spends a lot of time telling them his rather fantastic life story.  The plot is of course unpredictable and I enjoyed the chance meetings and surprise coincidences that kept popping up.

6856617,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"Part ""Forrest Gump"", part ""Amelie"", this is the story about a centenarian who decides he's tired of living in a retirement home, so walks to the station and buys a ticket on the next bus going anywhere. His adventure begins with and is shaped by the different people he meets. Meanwhile, he reminisces in flashbacks to his life as a child, a teen, a young man, an adult, etc, and all the significant people he encountered along the way. He has a way of being in the right place at the right time, as well as the ability to recognize opportunities and seize them, which causes things to turn out in a mostly positive way. Much of the humor is not simply in what happens to him or who he meets, but in how he accepts or deals with those events and people. The film eventually shows that life is not really lived in isolation, but in interaction with other people. Highly recommended.",1458604800,,881,4.411042944785276

Along the way he meets an assortment of weird characters, including an elephant, who, of course all become his friends and cohorts.

The old man's story reminded me a bit of Chauncey Gardener in ""Being There"": he took life as it came and ultimately reached success by sticking to his few basic approaches, with others taking his simplicity for genius.

The acting is good for a couple characters but is generally just OK.",1458000000,2,395,4.764705882352941

Who knew that so much of 20th century history was shaped by this man, Allan, who has lived through it all.  The story tells of Allan, a 100 year old nursing home resident, who isn't quite ready to kick the bucket and as the film's title suggests, climbs out the window and disappears.  His adventure increasingly brings in more oddball characters, an elephant, and sets the stage for them to become the beneficiaries of an unintended perfect heist.

I've noticed several people have compared this to Forrest Gump, and maybe that's (ahem... ugh)an apt comparison... personally, I loathed Forrest Gump's corn syrupy, saccharine, sappy type of sweet that sticks to your teeth like that kind of candy you always forget you hate until you're trying to chisel it out of your molars....
but, I digress.
It's been a while since I watched this but I seem to remember that I was reminded of the films of Jacques Tati. Maybe not quite as remarkable as those classics, but it's still a fun and farcical ride, nonetheless.
If you're a fan of Mon Oncle, Monsieur Hulot's Holiday and.the absolutely brilliant, Play Time, then give this a shot.
Oh, and vice versa... if you liked this and have never seen a Jacques Tati film, then, zut alors, qu'est-ce que vous attendez? Vite!",1457308800,,818,4.767605633802817

6856851,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"This movie starts out strong and has quite a few laughs early on. You will need captions, as the languages in the film include English, Swedish, Russian and Spanish, although Swedish is mostly predominant with English a distant second. There is lots of cursing, including many repetitions of the F-word, and there is some gore (a severed head) and toilet humor, mostly played for comedy. ""The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window"" is reminiscent of other films, notably Woody Allen's ""Zelig"" with a touch of ""Forrest Gump.""

Like those movies, many of the scenes are preposterous. For example, a New York City construction worker in 1943 is not going to know what the Manhattan Project is, much less what the Manhattan Project is building. You have to suspend your disbelief and go with the comedic flow.

I thought the film fizzled out some at the end, as though the writers couldn't think up a way to maintain the humor. Still, ""The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window"" is an entertaining movie if you're interested in something offbeat and don't mind having to concentrate on captions throughout.",1457222400,,1114,4.920212765957447

6856856,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"This is a wonderful film that took me by surprise.  I had no idea what it was when I saw it available from Amazon Streaming, but the film's title pretty much provides the gist of the story.  Add to that a fun nutty story about the old guy being pursued by a biker gang and a mobster who want a suitcase that has fallen into his possession and the man's thinking back on an adventure filled life, you get a movie not unlike FORREST GUMP or BENJAMIN BUTTON.  Sure, it's unlikely, but it's such a good time that I very willingly suspended disbelief to be entertained by this enjoyable film.  As a warning to those who don't like to read subtitles, there are subtitles for much of the dialogue.  The narration is in English as are some portions of the dialogue.  I don't mind subtitles, but I know some people are very turned off by them.  If that is you then you might not enjoy this film.

Its blending of current narrative with historical happenings reminded me of similar associations in Forrest Gump. Again though, my feeling is that viewing it from that culture would have unlocked social nuances that remained, alas, invisible because I'm a mere Yankee.  A worthwhile thing to view, yes, but with the limitation of having at least one foot in the hole of the New World's un-synched perspectives on growing old.",1457222400,,601,5.195876288659794

This 'picture show"" is probably the most delightfully ""stick to the script"" movie I have ever watched, and your laughter will resound from wall to wall when you see what you have read and roared over exactly as Gustafsson has told the story.
""Old"" is such a dirty word in today's fast-paced world, and this slow-paced wonderful man proves that being old and meeting the right people (who understand 'old') can create experiences and occasional accidental performances as the way to go.
As he meets statesmen, criminals, kind people, frustrated people and those who love vodka, this century old man solves so many problems with knowledge and sometimes just plain luck.  ( And of course a cordial nip of vodka or two) it is wonderous to see.  You will be able to pull yourself away from so much of today's literature filled with the dark side of life with a light-hearted new respect for the the word ""old"" and the 100-year-old
man!  Remember, the book was fiction, the movie is sub-titled and is fiction and the humor is what it should be!  Try it, you'll like it!!!!!

Easily the best movie I've seen in months. Don't let the subtitles put you off, there's still a lot of it in English. The humor translates perfectly across languages. I'm home sick in bed and it really lifted my spirits. Lots of little human insights sprinkled in between the whimsical humor, adventures, history and explosions!

The guy is 100 years old, after all, and he could really care less about living longer, just taking each day as it comes...and boy does it come.  When a tough mobster tells him over the phone that he ""going to kill him,"" the old man's calm reply is that he'd better hurry up, reminding him that he's already 100 years old.  Money?  Who cares?  Lost souls, there's fortune in them, the old man's sage advice worth millions (thus the Forest Gump caparison).  Well filmed, in fact, terrifically filmed.  It's not wonder that this is the 3rd highest grossing film in Swedish history (not the highest, as Amazon reports in their caption).  Well worth staying through the slow, almost plodding pace...he's 100 for heaven's sake; this is his story from his viewpoint.  Don't rush him...",1455667200,,1023,4.670391061452514

May be being European it is somehow closer to me but mainly I like the fact that a few times the movie actually surprised me where it was leading. First I though ""oh my gosh, what am I watching???"" but then it started... very surreal and very funny movie... also, well starred!",1455062400,,539,4.242718446601942

Perhaps things were lost in translation. There were a number of laugh out loud moments. Now I remember the movie that was similar: Forest Gump! The main character in 100 Year Old Man... is also entwined with historical characters (Lenin, Truman, Franco and others).",1455062400,,426,5.014084507042254

It gives one a chance to understand the Russian sense of humor which attempts to drown out the years of tyranny they were under, so this orphaned child blows things up as a way of coping and is sterilized by the KGB, then as he's placed in a nursing home, old and childless he escapes and the real fun begins.

6857810,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"This is a movie that is a comedy of errors. In some ways it is like a Swedish ""Forrest Gump"" crossed with Fargo in that it blends and bends history with a touch of dark humor to tell parts of the story. Throw in a bumbling motor cycle gang and you have a wild mix of farce and comedy. The humor is dark but understated at times as it is the craziness of the situation. A 100 year old man escapes his nursing home and takes the first bus he can afford out of town only to take a suitcase that doesn't belong to him and attempts at its retrieval lead to lots of mischief and mayhem. The story goes together well and most of the movie is in English and when it is not it does subtitles. Lots of vulgar language so this movie isn't kid friendly but definitely worth a watch. Only about 30% of the movie is subtitled, mostly the movie is in English.",1453593600,,844,4.059880239520958
6857811,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared is a whimsical story with twists and turns and sometimes worthwhile messages presented gently, not hammered home.  I have watched it several times and introduced friends to it, also.  Every time it makes me laugh.  With every viewing I notice new details and gain greater appreciation of the details of the story, the characters, and the production quality.  I have read the book in English and Swedish and have found the changes from Swedish to English to film script fascinating. In comparison, the film sets a faster pace right from the start.  As always, there are some details and richness lost in each translation and adaptation, and some others gained at the hand of skilled writers.  Quite a fun piece to study!",1453593600,,787,4.924242424242424

I probably would have liked the movie better if I hadn't read the book, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Still, I liked the film too and it's an interesting glimpse at a happier Sweden (unlike the doom and gloom of Kurt Wollander or the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo series) in spite of the plot driven by organized crime. A nod to Fellini in the style of the film which I did not imagine reading the book, but it worked for me.

The charm, the humor of the book is lost, interaction and even characters were totally re-written or dropped to make a movie out of it. Life events of Allan were changed, dropped or added.

6857950,5,B00Q5NNMEW,This is a wonderful movie! It is a comedy of errors where ordinary people in everyday occupations carry on while circumstances produce very laughable outcomes. There is a love story in there and a crime story and political intrigue - even the atom bomb. All of it is very serious. Nobody laughs - but the viewer can't help it. It is a Swedish movie but much of it is in English and where subtitles are needed they are provided. If you miss this movie you will will miss a most delightful experience.,1453420800,,499,4.434782608695652

This Swedish film harkens back to the old days when Hollywood was funny instead of the pearl-clutching PC killjoys that they are today. It's irreverent, makes fun of just about everyone, and is completely foot loose and fancy free. The sound track is amazing, too. I hope Prime decides to include it in its free streaming. If you want something that will really make you laugh out loud, that's goofy and at the same time incredibly smart - watch this one. You won't be disappointed, I promise. What the heck, Sweden. lol",1453161600,,600,4.778846153846154

The main character, Allan, literally just decides to climb out his bedroom window on his 100th Birthday and wander away. The story bounces back and forth between his previous adventures and the current one, with never a dull moment. You see, Allan isn't too bright, but he has incredible luck. As such he finds himself in one sticky situation after another, but doesn't know it and always bumbles through. The result is a hilarious and heart warming film.",1452988800,,688,4.733333333333333

6858104,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"Allan, at advanced age, blows up the fox that killed his cat and winds up in a retirement home.  On his 100th birthday, he hears small explosions outside his room.  He climbs out his window to investigate, and finds a young boy playing with firecrackers.  And his freedom.  He does not go back inside.  Instead, he embarks on a serendipitous adventure, muddling along as he's done all his life.

As Allan's adventure unfolds, he narrates the story of his life, and it's presented in flashback scenes.  How else would a 100-year-old recount his life in a movie?  At a young age, Allan becomes fascinated with explosives.  After he's orphaned, his obsession with blowing things up lands him in a mental institution.  But his expertise with dynamite serves him well later, as he&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Forrest-Gump/dp/B0035JRVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Forrest Gump</a>s his way through the 20th century.

All the performances are grand, and this is no cheap foreign film.  Uh uh, no way.  It's a round-the-world tour de force of funny - mostly in the form of booze, peeing, guns, and of course, explosives.  The pyrotechnics alone cost a fortune, let alone all the locations!  This is a timeless sort of comedy, bound to be rediscovered for generations.

Told as a series of flashbacks during his most recent highly improbable ""adventure"" which begins when he ""escapes"" from an old folks home on the day of his one hundredth birthday party.

With touches of Monty Python, Fargo, War of the Roses, but not gag after gag, it's definitely not a movie I'd recommend for everyone.  To say more would be spoilers.

I wasn't expecting Swedish with English subtitles, and that was made far worse by the subtitles being printed in white and often obscured by the background.

Characters, good or bad, were utterly engaging, and we loved how the story kept looping back on itself to pick up new players and explain previous events.

It is a romp that will leave you glad of the time you just spent.",1449273600,,431,4.76

6858154,5,B00Q5NNMEW,Stumbled across this on Amazon video. Essentially a Scandanavian version of Forrest Gump minus all that love interest turned AIDS victim stuff.

6858176,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"If Garrison Keillor was hired to write a screenplay about Mr. Magoo meets Forrest Gump, this movie would be the result.  It clearly follows the Forrest Gump model of having the protagonist meet historical figures throughout his life with a significant impact on history.  He bumbles his way through life in a Mr. Magoo, haphazard way. The humor is understated with occasional scenes of violence.  The body count was moderate but done in a way that wasn't revolting.

Maybe if I was from Minnesota I'd have a better appreciation of the humor.",1449100800,,541,4.8478260869565215

It is a simple story with some simple comedy and also some very subtle and sophisticated jabs at the pretentious world we're in.

And to think I almost didn't continue to watch it after the first few minutes. But the more you get into this flick the more caught up in just-what-the-heck-will-happen-next episode. Aside from stealing a bit from W. Allen's ""Zelig"", the movie flies along with zany twists and surprise happenings--and more dead bodies, each one more distressingly funny than the last. And an ending that keeps you wondering whether or not . . . well, never mind. Amazing that this comes free with my Prime account, and in my first week as a Fire Stick TV owner (after I got the battery compartment opened, that is!).",1449014400,,732,4.771653543307087

This is a movie which is somewhat similar to Forrest Gump or Little Big Man.  You have a character who is very old, and seemingly somewhat simple, but that's deceptive.  It would be fairer to say that he's not simple, but rather extremely laid back, so all kinds of terrible events wash right over him without really scathing him.  At the same time, he has essentially one interest in life, which is ""blowing things up"".  Not because he's rotten and wants to hurt people, but just because he likes the act of exploding things.  And over the course of time this has caused him to be at or near the center of a number of historical events, and to be acquainted with a number of historical figures.  There are a few of the same elements as in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, such as the vicious biker gang, and yet for all their viciousness, they can't really get a handle on the centenarian hero, or really cause him any harm; so the movie retains its lightheartedness even in the face of some vicious characters, murders and near murders, and of course ""things getting blown up"".  And there are some things in the movie that, for me at least, were simply uncontrollable, laugh-out-loud moments.  I'd highly recommend it to anybody who can tolerate things, lots of them, being blown up or otherwise destroyed, and accept that it may still be funny.",1449014400,2,1569,4.47719298245614

6858349,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"I found this extremely funny and very well done.  Great cast!  But my spouse did not like the violence (people get killed).  I had read the book, so I knew what to expect, and I took it to be tongue-in-cheek.  I mean, after all, when the chief character is someone who describes himself as ""I like to blow things up,"" it has to be funny!  And what other movie has an elephant, no less, who (spoiler alert!!) does away with one of the bad guys!  Or a ""biker gang"" that is never seen on or anywhere near a motorcycle (they drive rather ordinary cars), and is utterly incompetent!
And just to be clear, normally I am not a big fan of violence in movies.
One odd thing is that the narration is in English but the rest of the soundtrack is in Swedish with English sub-titles.  It worked for us but might seem a bit odd to some viewers.",1449014400,,830,4.182389937106918
6858350,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"Wow, what a gem of a movie!  I went into this with fairly low expectations and was blown away at how entertaining and quirky it was.  Think Amelie meets Grand Budapest Hotel.  It has subtitles and efficient use of flashbacks, coupled with eccentric characters and a plot that oozes with creativity, and this was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  So unique and fun!  If you want to escape reality and get lost for a couple hours, do what Allen did and climb into this movie for a while.  It's worth it!",1449014400,,517,4.278350515463917

It is hilarious! The movie takes several dives through history, sort of like Forrest Gump, while following this 100 year old's man current escapades which must be seen to be appreciated.

6858382,3,B00Q5NNMEW,If I hadn't read the book I would have rated the movie higher.  The movie left out significant encounters that the old guy had while traveling around the world in his earlier life.  Instead it focused on the present when he bailed out of the nursing home and the immediate adventures that followed. It would have been worth it to make a longer movie and include the missing past.,1448582400,,379,4.478260869565218

The film starts out nicely, but the further in you go, the further from the book the film strays.  The further it strays, the more is lost and things just get muddied up, crucial characters and scenes are left out or given short shrift and the characters for some inexplicable reason are all made dumber and perhaps meaner than they are in the book.  My recommendation is be sure and read the book, but the movie is hardly worth watching.",1448236800,,526,4.346938775510204

People who read the book are commenting that people who didn't read the book probably enjoyed the movie more.

Let me start by saying I have not read the book, and I most certainly did not enjoy the movie more than those that read the book.  I found the movie to be confusing, slow, disorganized, and really not all that funny.  For some reason, the director made the decision to make about 1/2 the movie subtitled and the other half English.  Didn't understand that at all.  I do not mind subtitled movies, I don't really even notice a movie is subtitled once it starts.  I found the pace to be horrendously slow.  I did not really understand all the jumps in time or how the story came together as a whole.  It was almost like two movies with two stories.",1448150400,5,930,4.268571428571429

Part of the reason for this is that, having read the book (which I did enjoy - see my book review on Goodreads), there was much that was left out. But more importantly, the humor that was built up in the book did not have a chance to build in the movie.

Nothing wrong with the acting. The issue is just trying to stuff too much into too little time, without a building of the humor.",1447632000,,415,4.060975609756097

He escapes from the nursing home on what is supposed to be is hundredth birthday, takes a bus, accidentally walks off with a suitcase full of mob money, and through what are largely a series of accidents, misunderstandings, and lucky breaks manages to survive the mob's attempts to retrieve the cash.

6858901,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"Ingenious - heart-warming - ballbreakingly funny  entertaining to the end  Felix Herngren's ""The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out Of The Window And Disappeared"" on BLU RAY is all of these things and more. Based on the best-selling book by Jonas Jonasson - think ""Amelie"" meets ""Forest Gump"" meets The Coen Brothers (firing on all sixes) but filmed in Swedish. What a breath of fresh air this wonderful film is...

It goes like this. While a butch matron heads towards Allan Karlsson's bedroom holding a marzipan cake loaded down with a sea of lighted candles - the aged but still sane Allan (played to perfection by Robert Gustafsson) climbs out the window of his enforced retirement home and does a Birthday bunk. A few minutes later  he's in his night robe and cork slippers entering a quiet bus station. There he meets a young but extraordinarily dim tattooed thug called Hinken (Sven Lonn) with a large garish suitcase who tells him crudely to 'mind' his luggage while he takes a leak in the tiny stationhouse loo that won't accommodate both him and his heavy load. But the slightly befuddled Allan is 100-years old and no longer has patience for such crap  he only wants to catch a bus leaving in three minutes to some tiny Swedish town (a one-way ticket he purchased only moments earlier with his pocket change). The problem is that Allan doesn't understand what's 'in' the pink suitcase and how valuable it is until he teams up with another old-timer Julius at the bus-stop end (played by the famous Swedish actor Iwar Wiklander). Whacked over the head with a crocket mallet  Julius puts the aforementioned thug Hinken (comes looking for his suitcase) in a home refrigeration unit on full and thereafter all Hell breaks loose once Hinken's minders don't hear from their twit.

Along the way we flashback to a younger Allan Karlsson who somehow manages to affect the lives of countless hapless eejets from history (loads of cleverly woven-in famous names) - while engaging in his true lifelong passion  blowing things up with dynamite (a fox who killed his cat, toilets in the back yard and bridges in a Spanish war). There are dancing Communist dictators, a talkative ironmonger whose the first to get shot, Ronald Reagans gardener reasoning with the 1980s howdy-doody President about 'his wall needing to come down' (thereby planting in his addled actors brain the famous phrase he said to Mikhail Gorbachev about the Berlin Wall), Allan advising Oppenheimer and his Manhattan Project team in a non-nonsense way how to detonate the biggest bomb of them all, acquiring American President Trumans cigarette lighter after a drunken dinner and then giving it to the son of a double-agent in the Cold War, Franco's near-death experience on a Spanish bridge, Herbert Einstein (Albert's extraordinarily dimmer brother) ending up with Allan in a Russian Gulag (displeased Stalin during a vodka/dancing session) and a British drug dealer living by his pool in tropical Bali (Alan Ford playing Pim) who wants his 50 million back or someones gonna be dinner  and not in a gourmet kind of way.

Meanwhile back in the now - Allan also has to deal with Benny (David Wiberg) - the weedy non-committal driver he and Julius enlist to escape the bad guys. Benny can't seem to finish any University Degree he starts let alone a cohesive sentence (he's done 30 degrees or more in his need for knowledge he can't use) - not to mention Benny's unspoken lust for the feisty but pretty Gunilla (Mia Skaringer) - a Swedish chalet owner who keeps an elephant in her barn that her psychotic ex-boyfriend stole from a circus when they weren't looking. Meanwhile hot on all their trails is the aging Swedish Chief Inspector Aronsson who can't tell his arse from his elbow and just wants an easy life (a stunning understated panic-stricken performance by Ralph Carlsson). The effect of all this lunatic goings-on is to keep the story moving along nicely while at the same time remaining endlessly entertaining...and very, very funny...

While they're speaking Swedish there's English subtitles on the bottom of the screen  except while Alan Ford speaks  his dialogue is all in English (plays Pim the British gangster  he was Bricktop in Guy Ritchie's ""Snatch""). The BLU RAY picture is gorgeous throughout (bars top and bottom though) and even when the story is flashing back to so many world locations  the clarity never lets up. The facial close ups of various nutjobs have great presence and somehow add immensely to the whole madcap feel of the film.

""The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out Of The Window And Disappeared"" should have been Oscar-nominated for script and won  but you can glean just how good it is by the fact that almost all five of its worldwide nominations have been 'Audience Awards' - which speaks the volumes about this gem the so-called critics arent. And who would have thought the Sweeds could be this funny.

6858939,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"Late in ""The Hundred-Year-Old Man,"" theres a scene in which the bad guy, having slipped and fallen into a pile of elephant poo, watches in horror as the pachyderm begins to lower its gigantic rear end toward the mans head. The villain, still clutching his handgun, has just one recourse: empty the gun into the elephants maximal gluteus  and hope for the best. You can probably guess how effective this technique is.

If that scene sounds amusing, then youll likely enjoy the rest of this absurdist Swedish comedy, which follows two paths in the life of the titular character: 1) a series of flashbacks in which young Karlsson appears, Forrest Gump-like, at pivotal moments in history with the likes of Stalin, Franco, Reagan, and Einstein (well, one Einstein), and 2) a madcap road adventure in which the geriatric old-folks-home escapee finds himself on the run from enraged bikers.

""Man"" is certainly ambitious  perhaps too ambitious. If I were to dispense with one of the two story threads, Id toss the flashbacks, which are amusing but more silly than clever. The old man on the lam, on the other hand, is delightful, a throwback to the sort of screwball oddities that Hollywood used to produce in the 1960s.  -- grouchyeditor.com",1440374400,,1236,4.894736842105263

6858949,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"""The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window and Disappeared"" (2013 release from Sweden; 112 min.) brings the story of Allan. As the movie opens, we see him grieving over his cat Molotov, and he takes revenge by blowing up the fox who killed Molotov. That ;lands him in a retirement home, and Allan hates it there. As the retirement home is getting ready to throw Allan a party for his 100th birthday, Allan escapes through the window, and off he goes. It's not long before he ends up holding the suitcase of a stranger at the bus station, only later to find out the suitcase holds 50 million Kroner in cash. At this point we're not eve 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is the big screen adaptation of the popular book from Jonas Jonasson, and what a delight this movie has turned out to be. Almost from the get-go, Allan (played brilliantly by Robert Gustafsson) makes light of everything and everyone, and whether he knows or realizes it or not, he gives new meaning to the phrase ""I wasn't born yesterday!"", literally. The movie really is a two-for-one: there are the flashbacks to Allan's earlier life, in which he, Zelig-like or Forrest Gump-like, end up meeting famous people (Franco, Stalin, Truman, Reagan, etc.), and then there is the current story in which Allan and his eventual friends are chased by a biker gang and the police. It may sound a bit ordinary, but in fact that part of the movie is BY FAR the better over the flashbacks, and outright hilarious. The only minus about the US release of this movie is that the voice over comments from Allan are dubbed in English (even though the rest of the movie is in the original languages and subtitled). The US distributor simply couldn't leave good enough alone <sigh>, but in the end it's a minor quibble.

""The 100 Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out The Window and Disappeared"" finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Why it's taken 18 months to get here, I don't know. I'm just glad that it finally did show up. The early evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED, and the crowd absolutely LOVED the movie, constantly laughing out loud (including myself). Given the positive word-of-mouth this movie will be getting, I predict this will play here for many weeks to come. If you are in the mood for one of the funniest and most irreverent movies to come along in a long time, you cannot go wrong with this, and I suggest you catch this, be it in the theater or eventually on VOD or on DVD/Blu-ray.

6858951,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"""...Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared,"" or  ""Hundraringen som klev ut genom fnstret och frsvann,"" whichever suits you best. This silly, goofy entry from Sweden (English captions when necessary) is my first rave review from the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival. This black, black comedy played to a packed house; it generated howls of laughter throughout, then thunderous applause when it ended. Some of us laughed all the way home on the bus, too.

Director Felix Herngren crafted a brilliant script along with Hans Ingemansson, which was based on Jonas Jonasson's novel about a Zelig-type fellow who loves blowie uppie stuff. Over the course of this hilarious film, we see him with General Franco of Spain, Josef Stalin, Harry Truman, Albert Einstein's brother, J. Robert Oppenheimer of the Manhattan Project, Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan and others I failed to note at the time.

The movie starts when his beloved cat is killed by a fox...so he promptly blows it up, and it goes on from there. The marvelous script unfolds in a logical way, it just sounds so unlikely!

We follow:
  * Robert Gustafsson as Allan Karlsson (brilliant award-winning makeup!), as he ages from a young man who suffers an unfortunate surgery to a very elderly man who loves aquavit or vodka. He has a very simplistic world view and tends to let the big issues roll right off his back.
  * Iwar Wiklander as Julius, the cordial fellow who helps our hero with his unwieldy suitcase (you should see how he came by THAT!) and dispose of that pesky corpse.
  * David Wiberg is Benny, a perpetual student who never finishes anything he starts. He needs a firm hand.
  * Mia Skringer is Gunilla, who has a very firm hand (and an elephant)!
  * We also have a terrific supporting cast: a law enforcement officer trying to make sense of the case; an infuriated mob boss demanding that suitcase (if only his thugs could find it!); that other corpse in Djibouti; the elephant who sits on a gunman; plus numerous other lowlifes, thugs and molls.

Little touches, like the music's exact match to Allan's footsteps, the cars and clothes that perfectly suit each time period, the senior discount for the bus ticket. It goes on and on.... I bought it when it was only available in Region 2 format because I have an all-region player, but now everyone on this side of The Pond can enjoy it too!

6858952,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"Hard to get in the netherlands, That's a pitty. Becouse it's an extraordinary movie after an extraordinary book. Very funny.",1433548800,,124,5.25
6858953,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"When coming to review this little gem of a Swedish film, I'm still not totally sure how to exactly define it. Is it an adventure type of film, is it a satire on historical events and celebrated people of the past?... Maybe it's a mixture of both things, but one fact remains firm and strong for sure here - this is one of a hell laugh-out-loud film, and at that, one of the best of it's kind I was fortunate enough to stumble upon and watch! Also, this is quite a fine chance to hear a bit of some languages rather than just English all the time (though the film indeed has its share of English as well, scattered here and there, for a very good reason). Not to worry, of-course, you get subtitles in English whenever a foreign language is used, so no knowledge of Swedish, Russian, Spanish or French is actually required. Anyway, what I liked best about this film is its loyalty to the events described in the original book (heart-warmly recommended as well) and besides one or two incidents which would have made the movie too long, I guess those who haven't read the book at all will not even notice something is omitted in the flow of the story; As for the main character, Alan Karlsson, I'd describe him as something in between Forest Gump and James Bond, in a way - yes, he's extremely old, this geezer Alan, but her seems in-tact enough to keep getting out of troubles with luck at hand of the first mentioned, and in the elusive ways of the latter. Though some adventures he's going through are riveting and even, I'd dare say, eerie, he stays cool and calm as the skies in an early spring evening.
I won't go and spoil the element of surprise for you, but I'd like to add that one of the aspects I liked the most about this movie is the accuracy of the amazing resemblance the historical figures scattered though out the movie (Supposedly Alan Karlssons' flashbacks to his past) have when compared to their original counterparts. Thumbs up especially go to the make-up department. I could have sworn I'm seeing Albert Einstein's double of Stalin in front of me (you'll have to watch in order to find out the others that make appearance) in front of me... What is their connection to the plot you'll have to find out when sitting to watch the movie). Another warm advice from me to you - if you're on this page maybe you don't need this advice - don't come to watch ""The 100 Year Old Man"" (in short) if you're only into Hollywood productions and are not open to seeing characters who look less than perfect on the screen, because here no one is glamorous or exceptionally beautiful - although, as I mentioned earlier, the make-up work is truly amazing if they could transform a 50 year-old man originally (hint: a critical character to the story) look forty and fifty years older than he truly is.
To wrap things up, I truly enjoyed each and every second of this smart little Swedish production and lost count of how many times already I've popped this DVD into the my Player. So Join Alan Karlsson, please do, with no fears whatsoever as everything mysterious or weird is solved up in the end... See for yourself this fusion of imagination and historical facts, then go to the book which is recommended on its own account, and who knows? It might turn you into a fan of a very energetic little old man.",1427328000,6,3311,4.465346534653466
6858954,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"The absurdity of life, the ignorance of humanity including the most prominent leaders of the last half of the 20th Century, the worthlesness of statistics, the probability of improbables, the rule of paradoxes, contradictions and coincidences are projected in snippets for the viewer to masticate or disregard without any pretention.

One needs no background in sociology or psychology nor any information on Scandinavian peoples and cultures to move along with this film. Yet, the enjoyment bubbles up with empathy not for the main characters but for all the characters and a feeling for their all too obvious humanity.

The acting, the effects, the music, the directing may have added to the enjoyment but none of these factors shone to the detriment of the others. The film was a whole, as well it should be.

The problem for the non-Swedish speaker was  the additional absurdity of the subtitles.  I felt more inclined to turn off the subtitles and try to guess the conversation, rather than taking time off from the film to decipher the written drivel. (This may be only on the original Swedish version of the film, which I viewed)

If you are someone who thinks that his life has been of great significance, you may actually look down upon all the characters with pity rather than empathy. But, then, you would do well to disregard films like these altogether and move in the kind of realms which are inhabited by breast beating and flag waving heroes, adored by all sexes.",1423353600,35,1479,4.872509960159363

6858956,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"This movie adaptation of a Swedish best seller by Jonas Jonasson achieves what most studios who turn books into a film seem to find so hard to do.  It stays loyal to the storyline of the book.  There's a few parts of the book that aren't in the movie but all the key scenes are.  You certainly don't need to have read the book by the way to enjoy the movie, but it is a good book so you won't go wrong by doing so either.  There's a bit more detail in the book of course, such as you understand a bit more why he went out the window of the nursing home to avoid his 100th birthday party where he was to be used as free media plug for others from the book's pages, and the elephant and thug interaction is a lot simpler in the movie but overall there's not much fans of the book will be complaining about.

If you have no idea what this story is about, basically it's a Forrest Gump style tale, where a hundred year old man recounts to people he comes across who join in his journey his life through flashbacks where he as simpleton inadvertently influenced major historical events in Europe and the USA.  At the start of his journey a biker thug demands he holds onto a large suitcase on wheels while he used the toilet in a bus station, the old man has just spent all his money on a ticket to escape the nursing home and isn't going to miss the departing bus, but obeys the thugs wishes too.  Of course the thug is furious when he realises the old man is gone and is determined to get his suitcase and what's inside back.  The mafia types who had assigned the thug to have that suitcase in the first case also are very motivated to get it back.

My only criticisms of the movie were that the spoken language would switch between Swedish and English.  At first I thought I pressed the wrong button on the remote accidentally while trying to turn off the subtitles and so I restarted the movie.  It would have been better if they'd just picked a language, the subtitles still appear no matter which is being spoken.  The actor who played the 100 year old man didn't look like a hundred old man either, but instead a guy with makeup and fake skin, they really could have done a better job casting wise there. He didn't look at all frail like a man his age should have. They use the same actor for his whole life (other than as a little kid), a few different actors would have looked better on the screen.

Criticisms aside though, it's still a very enjoyable film which I'd rate four and a half stars and highly recommend to anyone.",1420675200,3,2530,4.224066390041494

Being that it is a product of Sweden, I was waiting for the other shoe to drop and for the makers to beat us over the head with some form of militant political correctness or another. However, I was pleasantly surprised that the typical Swedish social justice warrior mentality never really manifested itself.

The funniest part of the movie is when the annoying loudmouth communist from Spain who never stops talking about ""the revolution"" gets shot right between the eyes the moment he actually steps on the battlefield and makes his presence known. LOL! Oh my God that was so funny.

Really this movie is one laugh after another, even though some of the humor may be a bit morbid for some. Some of it may go over some peoples' heads. Robert Gustafsson does a relatively convincing job of playing the main character Allan Karlsson at various stages of life, from his 20s up to when he is ""the 100-year-old man.""

I gave this movie four out of five stars.",1533859200,,1036,4.529411764705882

8690490,5,B00Q5NNMEW,"Seriously amusing. Kind of like Forest Gump in a way. There are subtitles at points throughout (not the whole movie, but if you don't like movies with subtitled foreign language, you might be put off a little). It does have some language, and some crude humor at times (see the IMDB guide if you need more info on that). As with most, the book is even better (although this film is definitely entertaining!).",1533168000,,408,4.602739726027397

8690494,4,B00Q5NNMEW,"Had heard about the book many times, than I found the film. This is a great pick me up from the current horrendous enviornment. We can all use a laugh. A little long at times, but-overall well done.

This was the highest grossing Swedish film in 2015, so that gives you a good feel for what you get. The plot is pretty well defined, the 100 year old man, played by Robert Gustaffson, climbs out a window and disappears. We follow him and his exploits, and they are exploits. Very funny is places, and the bumbling characters we meet along the way are often hysterical. The film is in English, somet8mes in the language of the country that Allan is visiting. The film is never dull, and the acting by all is excellent. The storyline flows along, and can be compared to Forrest Gump at times, but I enjoyed this film so much more.

Recommended. prisrob 06-02-18",1527897600,,859,4.464968152866242
