2153532,4,B0002ZDPZ0,"After providing an overview of the Hermitage and the lives of Peter the Great and Catherine the Great, this series of 18 separate half-hour episodes attempts to provide a history of art based solely upon the paintings in the museum. That approach works where the museum's collection for a given period is strong (notably the programs on Egyptian and Dutch art, especially Rembrandt), but is far less successful in those areas where the museum's collection is weaker (e.g,, the Renaissance, Impressionism and Expressionism). The Hermitage is a fine museum, but it's not the Louvre. Its collection offers breadth but not depth.

The narration is painfully bad, the narrator (R. Parsons) being a representative of the psychological school of art appreciation-he repeatedly makes inane comments to the effect of ""We can see in her face exactly what this person is thinking.""

Of the 18 programs, the final one (focusing on Matisse and Picasso) is the best. Apparently the Communist regime allowed the museum to purchase Picassos, probably because of the strong stand he took against Franco. The Picassos in the museum's collection are both rarely seen and superb. Even Mr. Parson's commentary rises to the occasion.

For the casual or first-time viewer of films on the Hermitage, the three-tape VHS set entitled ""The Hermitage, A Russian Odyssey,"" produced by the Christian Science Monitor, is a better buy. Having viewed that, if you still want to see more of the museum's collection, you should then consider buying this DVD.

If you're interested in an historical walking tour of the Hermitage, consider buying ""Russian Ark,"" a 90-minute continuously shot movie of the museum. The extras on the disk (a tour of St. Petersburg, etc.) make it a special value.",1140134400,66,1756,5.129370629370629
2153533,5,B0002ZDPZ0,"Hermitage Masterpieces is currently being shown on CUNY TV in New York.  You will be blown away.  Excellent closeups of the artwork with intelligent narration.  It will open your brain.  There is accompaniment of music to enhance the subjects, sometimes a little distracting but never mind. This is so rare an opportunity. Unless you live in St. Petersburg next to the museum don't hesitate to buy this DVD.",1130112000,19,407,4.9411764705882355
2153554,4,B0002ZDPZ0,The series is a beautiful and engaging excursion through the rooms and art of the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. My reason for only 4 out of 5 stars is due to the distraction of the background music which at times almost succeeds in drowning out the narrative.,1483315200,,265,4.541666666666667

2153558,4,B0002ZDPZ0,We just returned from a trip to Russia and the Hermitage.  This dv will go right with our pictures and trip notes.  It makes it so enjoyable to read our notes and watch this to see much more that our photo's could show,1389312000,,218,4.046511627906977
2153559,5,B0002ZDPZ0,"I was able to see really great art without the problems of air travel, customs regulations and even more important, view and review again as many times as I want. There are not closing times.",1383177600,,191,4.485714285714286
2153560,5,B0002ZDPZ0,"I am very happy with the 3 pack DVD ""Hermtage Masterpieces."" This is an unforgettable journey on the numerous halls of  the largest museum of the world with the magnificent story-teller and expert on art. I am absolutely satisfied with the way how my order was accepted, completed and shipped. Thanks",1275609600,2,300,4.882352941176471

2153562,4,B0002ZDPZ0,"This 2004 set is a remastered and the best version of the 1992 original. It has a qood quality video, sound, and menu structure.",1194566400,10,128,4.375
2153563,5,B0002ZDPZ0,"What a treat!  This is a vast selection of rarely seen treasures--from Ancient China to 20th Century France--with fascinating narratives about the art, the artists and the times. And, it's all highlighted with fine classical music that illuminates the stunning visual images, making each of the 18 programs a unique and memorable experience.",1142467200,25,341,5.433962264150943
8035349,3,B0002ZDPZ0,"Wonderful coverage, abysmal sound. Narrator provides a rich, thoughtful review of a vast number of art works. But often you can hardly hear him beneath over-amped music. How this product slipped through the sound production stage is a mystery; the mix mars what would otherwise be a masterful survey of much of the history of Western art.",1520380800,,338,4.947368421052632

8035351,2,B0002ZDPZ0,"Watched this on Prime, which has this series divided into 18 Chapters-But the Chapter descriptions listed on Prime DO NOT necessarily match each segment.  So when you choose 2. Highlights of the Hermitage, you get 7. Sculpture Collection.  Choose 3. Peter the Great and you get the Highlights segment.  Choose 6. Art of Ancient Egypt and you get the Peter the Great segment. And so on.  The eccentric quartet music distracts from viewing many segments, until it actually drowns out the narrator at times on the last two segments.  This is indeed a clumsy production made soon after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

Not that it matters.  A lot of the paintings shown are from artists of secondary importance, from the Renaissance period onwards.  Nevertheless the narrator plays up these works as if they are great masterpieces when they are not.  While they are interesting works in their own right, I was surprised not to see more works by renowned artists featured in this series.  More disturbing are the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works depicted, which often show damage and wear from being looted during and after WWII.  Both Hermitage and Pushkin Museums proudly display these pieces (Degas, Renoir, Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Picasso, etc) that were either stolen from German and East Europe museums during WWII by NKVD units, or confiscated from Nazis who had in turn lifted them from their mostly-Jewish owners.

While museums around the world have started to return many of these confiscated or stolen works, Hermitage and Pushkin consider theirs to be war reparations, even though this violates post WWI international agreements on war reparations.  While the Louvre, British Museum and the Met are also guilty of receiving art works stolen from Egypt, Greece etc. during the 1800s, those museums have been forced to make some effort to return such items. Russia refuses to return the important loot, only allowing the return of minor items.  This series shows really how spare the Hermitage Collection is as far as important world-renowned works.  Aside from their own Russia-centered art, what they own from the Renaissance period onwards appears to be primarily by artists of secondary importance or else of dubious provenance. The 1980s-style production does detract from whatever useful information is shown in this series.",1511049600,,2353,5.1878306878306875
8035352,2,B0002ZDPZ0,"I was so looking forward to viewing this video series, as I have visited the Hermitage. The music
was far too loud and distracted from the narrator.

In video series number 10, the harpsichord was so excessive I discontinued watching the series. DRS",1509926400,,249,4.790697674418604
8035353,4,B0002ZDPZ0,"This is an interesting series, not as good as some others, like those of Waldemar, but competent. HOWever, the background musical score sometimes just overwhelms me with its ugliness and screeching attempts at exotic music, as in S1-E6 and S1-E7 where they try to have some caterwauling screeechie woman sound ancient and mystic. I mean, it goes on and on. I was only able to watch by killing the sound and reading subtitles. The same applies to other episodes. Millennials: I don;t care what you have to say.",1509580800,2,509,4.795454545454546
8035354,3,B0002ZDPZ0,"This program was viewed via Amazon Video, and the majority of the episodes were marred by the extremely loud ""background"" music that made it very difficult to hear the narrator.  I do not know if the same problem exists on the actual DVD set,  Since there is no descriptive signage for each item on the screen itself, turning the sound off and enabling captions to read the narration was necessary, and even the caption system was at times unable to reproduce the narration due to the loud music.  A good opportunity so see a fraction of the thousands of items in the Hermitage's collection, as this museum is not an easily accessable visit for most of us",1508284800,4,655,4.581196581196581
8035355,4,B0002ZDPZ0,"Created in an era when the Hermitage was behind the Iron Curtain and inaccessible to the West, this 18 part series is a comprehensive tour of the holdings of the museum. Poor quality VHS upload with bad sound mixing and worse subtitling, it is nevertheless a very good tour broken up by subject matter that covers the big hits but also the lesser known works in the collection. A good series for the hardcore arts fans.",1496793600,2,419,4.526315789473684

8035357,3,B0002ZDPZ0,"I was really looking forward to watching this in its entirety. Unfortunately, as stated by another reviewer, in some of the segments the background music drowns out the narration. Very annoying.",1491782400,4,194,5.290322580645161
8035358,4,B0002ZDPZ0,"I've always enjoyed the midevil, renaissance era art. With modern Technology I am able to view and learn more about artist that are extremely famous. This series is done nicely and very informative. You get a history lesson that you won't fall asleep on.
Only one thing I found irradiating was the classical music played to loudly.
Being hearing impaired I need to hear the vocal more not music.",1484352000,,395,4.739130434782608
