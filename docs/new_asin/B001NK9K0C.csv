I was disappointed with the material on the VHS Tape but it's worth it for the one or two solos.
If you're a Bruford fan I would recommend it.
I've checked elsewhere and it's still not available yet on DVD but a release date is pending.",1483056000,,304,4.0
8327238,4,B001NK9K0C,"Being a big fan of Neil Peart's expansive drumming dvds, I was a little edgy to find out this Bruford dvd was only half an hour in length.  But, it is a high-quality half an hour, in my opinion!

""Brevity is the essence of wit"" applies here.  Bill doesn't seem to waste time drawing out any subject too long, and his demonstrations and comments about gigging etc were very good.  I'm glad he didn't rip Yes or cast dispersions upon anyone he's worked with here, he always works from a positive point of view in this video (but this was about 30 years ago, before he got more jaded as well).

The sound quality is very good, and the video is of non-stellar quality but certainly gets the job done with effective camera angles so you can see what Bill is doing.

It's a nice 30 minute introductory clinic with Bill Bruford.  It's pretty, erm...concise, and certainly more would be appreciated, but when it ended I felt pretty satisfied.  Any musician and especially drummers would appreciate this.",1264464000,4,995,4.581920903954802
8327239,5,B001NK9K0C,"Guess i'm too picky about picture quality after sitting down and really watching this which runs a little over 27 min.
I've upped my rating and can live with this I still notice the separation center line in the video itself sometimes a wavy pattern but not bad.
I really enjoyed what Howe and Fripp had to say about their fellow musician also cool seeing King Crimson.
Good sound especially when Bill hits his Kick Drum,I like it!
So to sum up I would recommend this dvd for the drummers and not-drummers out there.
Also I like the way he holds those sticks right near the end and still have complete control,too cool.
And where else are you going to see Bruford working on those beats and getting it down.",1263772800,,707,4.446153846153846
8327240,5,B001NK9K0C,"How great to watch Bruford explain how he creates drumming riffs and patterns.  His insight about his left hand technique, and what that has meant to him as a musician, was particularly valuable.  A real treat to watch him drum up close, and to watch the King Crimson footage.  The interview of Steve Howe concerning Bruford's contribution to YES was dead-on.  Nice video.",1261872000,,372,4.857142857142857
8327241,3,B001NK9K0C,"Do I like Bill Bruford ?
Is he a great technical drummer ?
Both a given...

 YES !

Do I think 30 mins of footage with an elaborate explanation of how he holds his sticks and with tease of footage is worth $20's ?

NO !

Thanks for very little Bill .",1248048000,,250,3.730769230769231
8327242,5,B001NK9K0C,"A great treat, this one.  Worth the price for the live segment of King Crimson playing ""Discipline.""  The rest, all of it interesting, is a bonus.",1241568000,3,146,4.576923076923077
