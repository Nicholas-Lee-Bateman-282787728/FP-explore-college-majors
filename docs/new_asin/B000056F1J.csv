With the war against Napolean in Europe at last concluded, Britain was at liberty to send many of her veterans to North America  This was bad news for a bumbling and confused United States which couldn't even manage a decent camapaign in the first two years of the war in 1812-13.  How was the Young Republic going to stand up to 18,000 of Wellington's finest?
With period pictures, drawings, and some of the better known historians on the subject,including John Elting and Donald Graves, this video does a heroic job trying to provide an overview of the war leading up to the Plattsburg invasion and the battle of Lake Champlain. The video is intended to accompany Mr. Fritz Enns recent study on the campaign. Considering that it manages to convey all of this in some depth in a little less than an hour is a credit to the production indeed.  Still, this documentry could have benefited from a bit more length. Cramming all of the above into such a short time is a bit like a race!
The description of the naval battle on the lake is first-rate and shows just how deadly it was.  Having historians from both sides of the border and the Atlantic also provides a balanced perspective.  The inclusion of Governor General's Provost's current living relative is a nice touch.  Lord Provost had a lot of explaining to do for failing to take Plattsburg with such an impressive British army.  Even with the loss of his floatila on Lake Champaign it seems silly that he ordered a retreat against the meager American defence of General Mccombs on land.  Provost's timid leadership saved the United States again from almost certain defeat.
This reviewer highly recommends this video.  For one thing its one of the only videos out there on this neglected subject.  For another, it brings together an impreesive group of well known historians.  This alone makes it worth buying.  A deffinite must for War of 1812 nuts!",1025308800,21,1979,4.73469387755102
7931890,5,B000056F1J,"I would really differ with anyone that could find fault with such a fine work, I only wish it was longer. I had only seen brief descriptions of this battle prior to viewing the tape. It brought clearly into focus the entire war as well as this critical battle.
The original research has revealed that the British did have a set plan to invade America and that Washington DC, Baltimore and New Orleans were diversions.
I thought it clearly explained there were no winners in this War, except perhaps Canada. While the US failed to capture Canadian territory it did defend itself against many British attempts and likewise Canada remained faithful to the Crown.
The animation of the critical naval battle was particularly good as well as the detailed explanation of Congreves Rockets.
Noted historians from Canada, US and Great Britain helped to make it as non-biased as possible. Very enjoyable and a valuable asset to any 1812 collection. Particlarly interesting is the date, September 11th, the same date as the recent ""Attack On America""!",1000944000,10,1040,4.948571428571428
7931891,2,B000056F1J,"A highly tendencious piece that promotes the myth that the USA ""Won"" the war and ignores critical pieces of evidence.  A prime example of the US media's inability to be objective about US history.
Buy a book such as Donald Hickey's, and some hot chocolate, and have an early night instead.",993340800,4,289,4.666666666666667
7931892,5,B000056F1J,"The battle of Plattsburgh on Lake Champlain occured on nearly the same day as that of Baltimore and is therefore over shadowed by the Star Spangled Banner.  But Baltimore was a deception, intended to keep American re-enforcements and interest focused away from the border of northern New York.  There the largested foreign army ever to be on American soil struck south intending to do great harm.  This vedio tells that remarkable story in great depth with dramatic new information discovered during the research in Portugal.  The music is performed by the US Army Band.  Experts from England, Canada and the United States tell the tale in a profound manor.  Anyone interested in our history who is not conversant with the battle of Plattsburgh should see this complete telling of the story.",980380800,12,791,5.0
