8392075,2,B0039K5QPW,"In a sense, this DVD is a bit of a rip-off. Each program begins with a bunch of crappy scenes of Colorado and some joker singing the same cruddy song about Colorado before ever one gets to see anything about the steam trains of Colorado.  Seeing the same Loooonnnnnnnngggggg lead-in before ever really getting to see the all-too-short takes of Colorado's steam trains is a pain. For a railfan wanting to see the locomotives up close, learn something of their operation, see cab interiors, the trains in their settings, etc. these useless and repeated lead-ins are really a) Boooooring!  and b) Angering.  They could drop all the songster crap, and add in a solid decent amount of more material on the trains, cars, locomotives, their operation, etc. and would have a DVD worth what they charge for it.  As it is, had I known what is on the DVDs, I'd have tried just to get a copy from our local library and watch that instead of adding this one to my collection.  It's not worth the money because of the lead-in nonsense and the too-little real things of interest.  As far as I am concerned, the producers put the long same lead-in garbage in so their DVD would appear longer than the things of interest really are.  A bummer!",1275696000,,1226,4.570776255707763
