4223349,5,B003Y5H5IS,"The Virginity Hit is a great movie.  It mixes a documentary style of recording with comedy.  It's full of laughs, cries and more laughs.  I really like it and it's defenitely a keeper.  Let me know if you have any questions about it.",1305849600,,233,4.348837209302325
4223350,1,B003Y5H5IS,"This movie reminded me of Cloverfield, shot all with a hand-held camera that often was never stationary for more that a second.  The ""plot"" was boring and predictable and was a reworking of plots from a mix of other teenage comedies of the last few years.  By the end of the movie you can't wait to be done with the movie to make the money you paid to rent it not a complete waste.",1296518400,,381,4.135135135135135
4223351,3,B003Y5H5IS,"After making a pact to lose his virginity Matt sets up a motel room and everything is ready.  Zack is there to film the whole thing, then something goes wrong.  This is a ""mock-umentery"", which uses alot of ""youtube"" videos to tell some of the story.  This is a totally made up movie but shot like a documentery to get the right feel they want.  There was a definate ""American Pie"" & ""Superbad"" feel in some of the jokes and the way the characters act, but it's missing a quality these two had...humor.  Some parts are really funny, but there are also extrememly depressing things thrown in right as the movie gets rolling which grinds it to a halt and takes a while to feel like laughing again.  It's not terrible but I was expecting something laugh-out-loud funny and this was not it.  I think that some of the problem is that I may have outgrown this type of movie (20-somethings looking to lose their virginity), or it could just be that this one isn't funny.  You be the judge.  I give it a C-.",1295136000,2,999,4.356756756756757
4223352,4,B003Y5H5IS,"Not horrible, but not amazing, but it is good. I love the American Pie series, which this is pretty much like. This one is like watching a series of youtube videos, but I liked it. If you like goofy punchlines and entertaining teen comedies, this is one to see. It is silly and good-dirty funny. The Virginity Hit is a funny movie and will most likely entertain teens and adults. It's a hilarious movie that involves sex & bongs.",1293667200,3,429,4.443037974683544
4223353,4,B003Y5H5IS,"When I first heard about the movie, I'll admit I was skeptical wither or not a movie made out of YouTube videos would work. Suprisingly it does. While it does have the feel of an American Pie movie, and I mean the original ones and not the half assed spin offs, it still offers it's own identity among teen comedies. While the dialog is somewhat predictable sometimes but the actual presentation makes up for that. The guest stars, wither you know them or now, also is a plus for the movie. Normsbarstool from YouTube makes an appearance in the film and is a great surprise. Why this film made so little money is a mystery to me but then again it was released on only select screens. I even had to drive all the way to L.A. to actually see this movie. Rotten Tomatoes has rarely ever given a good rating for a movie so don't really trust them. It's not the perfect movie, but it's good. And the overall money earnings is really good for a movie that was most probably made for only a few thousand dollars.",1288483200,2,1005,4.322751322751323
4223354,2,B003Y5H5IS,"""The Virginity Hit"" is a story of four boys getting together to assist one of them, Matt (played by Matt Bennett), in losing his virginity (while filming it in the process).  It should be a simple task since he has been in a two year relationship with his sweetheart, Nicole (played by Nicole Weaver).  The two men responsible for bringing this to the big screen are the two writers/directors, Huck Botko and Andrew Gurland.  Judging from the quality of the movie, they must have been on a shoestring budget.

Overall, the movie script was predictable, the camera work was ala ""The Blair Witch Project"" and the acting was sub-par.  I almost left the theater to go home and check my laundry, but I was waiting for the one redeeming quality the film had to offer: Sunny Leone semi-nude.  Other than the two lead characters, Matt and Nicole, Sunny, the real-life porn star, portraying herself in the film, was the most likable character.  The added bonus of getting to see her do a couple of trips around a pole in a strip club added a bit of sexy flesh to the mix.

Why the two stars (versus one)?  There were actually a couple of good laughs in the movie and, with Will Ferrell as producer, a couple of crazy antics as well.  If you want to see ""The Virginity Hit"", I wouldn't recommend the theater--apparently a lot of people agree since it has only grossed $540,000 nationwide.  Do yourself a favor and rent the DVD.

Oh, BTW, the tags for this flick are actually for ""Vampires Suck""...I'll add some appropriate ones.",1286236800,,1518,4.5814814814814815
8408814,5,B003Y5H5IS,"As Justin Kline, the actor who plays Justin (the one with the mustache) in the film, it may be a bit unethical to rate my own film. But I hadn't watched it in about seven years, when it was the fourth worst box office opening of all time, so I decided to buy a copy and revisit it with fresh eyes.

I'll say this as objectively as I can, but the film is brilliant. Partly to due to major marketing miscalculations and mistaken expectations, it was wildly misunderstood at the time. Andrew Gurland and Huck Botko (writers/directors) come from a documentary film school background, and this was their take on a Broomfield or McElwee style doc, done through the style of Youtube videos. It's actually rather high-concept.

Gurland and Botko are masterful filmmakers. While some scenes had to be scripted, 75% of the film was improvised. Instead of putting us up in separate hotel rooms, they rented a stately house for the four of us to live in, 24/7. We got to know each other organically and became best friends. We got to know each other's quirks, how to get each other to say something funny, etc. In the few positive reviews we got, most complimented the ensemble acting. We were actually friends. Same goes for many of the other actors in the film. People like Nicole and Krysta spent plenty of time at the house (or we would be set up on dates) and our reactions to characters like that in the film were based on our own personal reactions to the actors. We got to know Krysta as an older sister. We got to know Nicole as someone we were trying to hook Matt up with. We used our real names in the film, and it often blurred fact and fiction. For instance, Huck and Andrew might send us into a military surplus store with a camera, not telling us what to do. While we were in there, someone's phone would ring. While the caller ID would ostensibly be Huck or Andrew, they would call as Nicole or another character in the film, and whoever picked up would talk to them as Nicole. They gave us multiple cameras to keep in the house, and we were told to film whatever we wanted. Much of it wound up in the film.

The film may be a bit sexist, but not any more (in fact less) than your regular teen sex comedy. For some reason, people walked out of this thinking there was rampant nudity. Apart from the nudity of strippers performing in a strip club, I didn't see any. I don't know why, but this film was trashed for being a moral outrage. I don't say that lightly. At an early screening, an actor was giving a Q&A, and he was confronted multiple times by critics, telling him he should be ashamed of himself for being in the film. There are so many worse (and better reviewed) films of this genre out there, so I'm not sure why ours got especially picked on.

This isn't even a straight teen sex romp. For those who haven't seen it, this film gets really rather dark and depressing. It fleshes out the characters and makes you care about them. The characters aren't cardboard cut-outs. They actually have backstories and reasons for existing in a film. Huck and Andrew weren't afraid of taking a 180 degree turn at several points in the film, to move on to touching or sad scenes. It often makes you feel uncomfortable, but it feels more real than any teen sex comedy I've ever seen. Why should everything be a laughing matter? Again, this was filmed as a parody of documentaries.

Lastly, you have to admire the casting of this film. Every supporting actor nails their scenes. The hotel manager almost steals the entire movie. Zack's parents were some of the best actors I've ever witnessed (after a certain scene involving them, we all stood up and broke into applause as soon as they yelled cut). Matt's real dad comes across as a deadbeat dad, and his girlfriend in the film is wildly realistic. They casted the best of the best. There is not a bad performance in the film (except, perhaps, for mine).

I whole-heartedly recommend this film. Not as a funny teen sex comedy. But as a film. A genuinely good film. Check it out. No one else is watching it, so pay the seven bucks and buy a copy. You won't be let down. I assure you.",1501977600,,4134,4.418635170603674

8408821,4,B003Y5H5IS,"I hadn't heard anything about this movie the first time I saw it and didn't realize it was fiction -- which might be why I like it as much as I do. It is entirely feasible that a group of high schoolers made the movie. There's a strong ad lib style to the acting. The kids are bright and funny, and also a little dopey and overly touchy with each other; which, if you consider what high schoolers are actually like, is pretty realistic.

If you can suspend your disbelief, this film is actually pretty enjoyable.",1342051200,,512,4.333333333333333

8408823,2,B003Y5H5IS,"The Virginity Hit is a pointless documentary about a few teenage boys who attempt to get their one friend to finally lose his virginity.  He has a girlfriend, but hasn't made that one all-important move to the bedroom, despite being in a relationship with the girl for 2 years.  From here, lots of twists take place, but almost none of them are interesting in the slightest.

In fact, because of how cliched this plotline is, every single twist is a waste of time, just like the entire concept of the film.

Anyway, the friends walk around with a video camera and, more often than not, spy on his friend while he's attempting to get his groove on.

I admit the boy on a quest to lose his virginity is a pretty good actor, which is why I'm going to be generous and give the Virginity Hit a 2 star rating instead of a 1 (which is honestly deserves).

It's typical teenage nonsense really.  This is the kind of stuff that makes me extremely thankful I finally became an adult and regret the horrible way I was probably like back in the day (embarrassing to admit, I wasn't much different from the teenagers in this documentary, and yes, that truly *is* something I strongly regret).

Avoid, because utter pointlessness takes up the majority of this failed experiment.",1308528000,,1264,4.561946902654867
