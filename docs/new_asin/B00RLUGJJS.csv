6932000,5,B00RLUGJJS,"I have always been skeptical of work-out videos because they never seem to deliver what they are selling.  The work-outs are geared to make you fail because they are high-powered and never take into consideration disabilities or even age for that matter.  After watching Kims work-out video, I have changed my mind.  Kim sets up her video to encourage you to NOT fail.  She has beginner, intermediate and advanced work-outs.  Honestly I am so out of shape, I cant possibly begin to keep up so I automatically set myself up for defeatuntil I watched the beginner video.  Kim is amazing..she makes it all about what you can do!  In her encouragement she keeps telling you if you cant do it slow down and modify to what you can do.  I still cant keep up, but each time I exercise I can do a little more than before so I am succeeding.  Maybe more importantly for me, I am spending some much needed me time doing something good for myself while I clear my mind of the daily stresses and spend time thinking about God and his goodness.  Thank you so much for this video and the inspiration on your video for people like me!  It is for the mind, body and soul!

I was given a copy of this DVD by the Author Kim Dolan Leto in exchange for my honest reveiw.  I was not required to give a favorable reveiw.",1433894400,6,1297,4.331950207468879
6932001,5,B00RLUGJJS,As a full time working mother of two I have limited time to work out. Kim provides an easy solution in her FIT workout video series. I got a better workout in 20 minutes than I get from working out at the gym for an hour!  I like that I can pick a low impact version and she gives good form reminders too.  A perfect partner to the FIT book!,1427587200,5,341,3.857142857142857
6932002,5,B00RLUGJJS,"This is an excellent DVD series for all fitness levels! The exercises are straight-forward and uncomplicated yet pack a punch. Kim's crystal clear way of presenting each circuit makes it so easy to follow rather than playing catch up as in many DVD routines.  I love and appreciate that her focus is on correct form vs speed and that she verbally reminds and models this throughout each series.  Additionally, modifications are explained and modeled making it so simple to adjust the workout to your current fitness level.  I crave my twenty minutes of this amazing full body workout!  It's the perfect ""pick me up"" and it's so easy to fit into my day everyday. I am so thankful for Kim's heart and desire to challenge us to a higher reason for being healthy and fit.",1438819200,2,767,4.659259259259259
6932003,5,B00RLUGJJS,"I bought Kim's F.I.T. DVD series and highly recommend it for anyone who's looking for a real and thorough change from the inside out!  This F.I.T. DVD contains 3 unique, one-of-a-kind, inspirational and Faith-driven workouts. The three 20 minute circuit workouts help you progress from beginner, to intermediate and advanced workouts. Each workout is well structured, easy to follow with Kim's expert cues and guidance. Modifications are offered to adapt the workout to your level of ability.
Kim's inspiration and encouragement are contagious and her Faith Inspired messages are timely and unique. I have a rather large selection of workout DVDs at home and this DVD stands apart in a very special way. Whatever your fitness level or ability, this DVD offers a great workout in a reasonable amount of time and will leave you feeling energized from the inside out! You can feel Kim's expertise, love, enthusiasm and Faith throughout each workout.
Sincere and heartfelt thanks to Kim for creating this DVD series and writing the accompanying F.I.T book. Her book and DVD have been life-changing for me. I am a personal trainer, wife and mom. Prior to becoming a wife and mom, I was always at a healthy weight. I didn't realize that with life's challenges, my coping mechanisms weren't always the best and I began emotional eating, gradually gaining 25 lbs! With F.I.T., I've learned to ""bring it to God"", rather than dealing with stresses by emotional eating. What a relief!
I love the field of psychology and I believe improving one's psychological coping skills is really important. But at the core,  the very centre of change is God, your Faith and Trust. We need to invite God into our life (and workouts!) to create real, true and lasting change in our health, lifestyle and every other area of our life.
Kim addresses spiritual, mental and physical fitness. The DVD and book triumph and stand apart from all others I've read as a personal trainer. I can honestly tell you that it is and will be the change you're looking for. It is for me! The F.I.T. DVD series is the perfect companion to the book. It is absolutely God-sent!
God bless you on your journey!",1437177600,7,2162,4.856368563685637

8695517,5,B00RLUGJJS,Absolutely love this work out video. First there are different levels of intensity which is nice because some days I need a good sweat but a lighter work out and other days I want more!  The workouts have a good mix of exercises and Kim is very motivating. The girls in the video show you how you can modify the routine so if you cant do the move you can do something similar until you work your way up. The workouts aren't super long either which I love!  Kim Dolan Leto is a motivator and someone that I look up to. Her book is also an amazing read so I highly recommend pairing them together,1515196800,2,594,4.156521739130435
