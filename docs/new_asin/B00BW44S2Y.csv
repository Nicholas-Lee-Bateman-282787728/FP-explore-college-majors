8574608,5,B00BW44S2Y,"The Light documentary is one of the most thought-provoking and inspiring films ever made, as it provides certified reports of personal experiences, interviews and scientifically documented laboratory experiments as evidence that there are people living today who do not need food either to live or to sustain their metabolism! They live on ""light"" alone or prana or chi, a phenomenon called ""breatharianism"".

What is so incredible is that the director P.A. Straubinger does extensive research and travels all over the world, meeting all kinds of people who are living as a ""breatharian"". This film does not try to push an agenda, in fact, it provides a neutral platform with interviews from both the protagonists and the antagonists. Bottom line is, if this state does in fact exist, then maybe we need to start questioning what science declares as the truth and the whole truth. Maybe we can open our minds more in order to begin to understand what our true abilities are as conscious beings...",1429142400,7,996,5.036363636363636

8574611,5,B00BW44S2Y,"Very interesting subject for an awakening world population.  A message of empowerment; that we are more than just biological and the human being can be so much more...true freedom comes from eating by choice and not by necessity.  Requires an open mind.  Good job presenting different sides to breatharianism and presenting it as a spiritual practice that brings peace, health and happiness to those guided by a higher force to live without food.",1386288000,14,446,5.082191780821918
