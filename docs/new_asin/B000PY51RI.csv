8193901,5,B000PY51RI,"This DVD was sent out free to all IJA members.  The IJA is basically a magazine subscription and grants access into one very expensive juggling convention per year, so getting a free DVD from them was a nice suprise.  I wasn't expecting much, but it was a lot longer than I expected and was entertaining.  Some segments were better than others and the whole DVD was dubbed over with royalty free music that kind of took away from the original music that was played in the segments.

Out of the sections that stood out, I really enjoyed the Ivan Pecel cruise ship segment and the segments on the juggling festivals/conventions.",1179964800,2,626,4.663636363636364
