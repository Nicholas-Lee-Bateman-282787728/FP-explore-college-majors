4043316,4,B0030BS1G6,"Shape: Best-Ever Hollywood Workout focuses on sculpting/toning. There isn't any cardio, and it lacks variety. The background music is like elevator music. Gunnar Peterson is calm, friendly, and gets to the point.  The basic, simple moves are great for the beginner exerciser. Gunner demonstrates the move first, then you start the repititions. The low repititions made me question the effectiveness of this workout, then I woke up sore this morning?! I did all 4 programs using the custom workout option. Continuous play - this may be the first time Shape has made this option available. When bought new, the dvd comes with a slip to mail in & receive SHAPE magazine 1 yr free.

TWO THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND:
1. This is a SCULPTING workout, no cardio.
2. This was effective for me because I did all 4 programs in sequence.

The only things you need for this workout are dumbells and a mat. Gunner offers modifications for beginners.

The DVD is broken down into 4 programs:

*Total Body Toning  20 min.
*Power Burn  20 min.
*Amazing Arms  11 min.
*Lower Body Blast  11 min.

I'll do my best breaking down each program, please leave a comment if you have any questions =)

1. TOTAL BODY TONING

COOL DOWN Stretch- quad/hip flexor, IT band & calves

The positive aspects of Shape: Best-ever Hollywood Workout include; Gunner has a calming effect, no tricky movements/choreography, no cardio (for those who dislike cardio), because he switches between floor & standing exercises - the time goes by quickly & the customize workout option. A long lasting workout since you can increase the weights as you progress with these multi-muscle exercises.

The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was bland & the movements were basic.  I am not a low key type of person. I love unique workouts with challenging moves....I get bored too easily. Power Burn sounded like it would be somewhat tough, but it just got my hopes up - Power Burn is a little misleading. BUT, I did wake up sore after doing all 4 programs.

As a mom of three young children, I don't really have the time to workout for an hour in order to get results. I do highly recommend this for beginner & intermediate exercisers, the 20 minute segments will be sufficient plus you can tack on one of the 11 min. workouts. You'll feel it the next day =)",1270598400,58,4852,4.587485515643105

4043321,3,B0030BS1G6,"I would classify this DVD as a beginner workout.  Most people will be able to complete all 4 segments without any problems.  The sets are usually only 8 reps so you must use heavy weights to be challenged.  I think it's funny that Gunner is using only what appears to be 3 or 5 lb. dumbbells throughout the entire DVD.  His warm-up consists of mostly static stretches which is a terrible thing to do; never stretch cold muscles.  Instead, do your own warm-up using dynamic moves you've seen in other DVDs.  Or, just simply do 8-10 each of bodyweight squats, side lunges, reverse lunges, front kicks, windmills, side leg raises, jumping jacks.  You get the idea.  There are better strength training DVDs out there, this one is just OK.  The music is boring, Gunner is boring.  I prefer ""Power Body Strength Training with Rob Glick.""",1395100800,2,831,4.6689655172413795

4043327,4,B0030BS1G6,I enjoy this workout.  It won't make you he-man but it is good exercise and he uses weights here and there so you can always make it harder.,1366416000,,140,4.0

4043330,4,B0030BS1G6,"I recommend this DVD for advanced beginners, comfortable pace and instructions, enjoy the work out without hurting.  Tried other DVDs of his, he gives time and doesn't make it excessive.  Overall I like it and want to keep doing it at least once or twice a week by alternating with other workout DVDs.

I wish camera angle changes from front to the side to get the complete view to follow through correctly and camera focuses the modifiers",1333324800,,439,4.675324675324675

4043333,5,B0030BS1G6,"This is my most recent purchase of a Gunnar Peterson tape.  I just love all the CORE SECRETS exercise videos that Gunnar Peterson has out.  I recently purchased each and everyone of them here off of Amazon because Gunnar is that GOOD!!!.  Each of his DVDs offers a different workout with different movements.  I have not found one of his tapes to be boring or a dissappointment.  He is simple yet very effective in the amount of time you spend with him.

You will not say ""I cant do that"" with Gunnar!!  All his exercises are for all age and fitness levels.

I love the variety he has to offer in each of his tapes and that is what makes it worth it to own and enjoy each and every one of them.  I recommend checking out all of his CORE SECRET tapes also along with this DVD.",1304640000,,775,4.1824324324324325

I gave my body a day to rest and was back the next day.  I can tell this will help tone up and start my weight loss goal.  Worth the $.",1300838400,2,278,3.6
4043335,5,B0030BS1G6,"I would consider myself pretty athletic, and I definitely prefer working out at home as opposed to going to a gym. This DVD provides a great at-home routine, but the moves can just as easily be learned and done anywhere. What I lobe about this workout and Gunnar Petersen is that he keeps things simple and sticks to the tried-and-true basics. After doing this workout, I'm always sore the next day. Do this DVD a few times a week, doing cardio interval training on other days, and you'll be in great shape!",1298678400,,507,4.521739130434782
4043336,5,B0030BS1G6,"I have plenty of good exercise dvds in my library now.  I have worked out for years-and I don't always have time to pull
different dvds out for different areas of toning/or cardio workout.
This in my opinion is by far the best Ive seen Gunnar Peterson in yet.  Infact, I keep looking for anything close to it
as I like it that much, still looking. I hope he reads this. Shape you did an excellent job with this dvd.  Ha
This workout cuts to the chase- Im able to workout cardio and TONE at same time.  It really does BURN~ :D-
and i like that he nails it down in small segments making sure not to overload, he smoothly blends to the next move-
easy, simple to follow and FUN!
This guy has trained the Hollywood Celebrities for a reason~ EXCELLENT TRAINER~ its like having Gunnar in my home.
I like the 20 min Turbo-Toning. and Calorie blast workouts, and he does have 2- 10 min routines to firm the hips,butt & thighs.  THis DVD has 4- wokouts all  under 30 minutes.  No more excuses. I tell myself.  theres time.",1298592000,,1013,4.267015706806283
4043337,5,B0030BS1G6,"I LOVE this workout video.  It's fast-paced (but not too fast for this Southern girl) and easy to follow.  I saw and felt results in my thighs, butt, and hips within 3 days.  It also has an option to play all four workouts in whatever order you want, so I often do the whole video...a whole hour of cardio and weights.",1297814400,,318,4.180327868852459

4043339,4,B0030BS1G6,"I borrowed this dvd from our local library and am considering buying it to add to my collection.  I am usually heavier into the cardio exercise, yoga and pilates and know that more toning with weights would be a good addition to my daily workouts.  I like the fact that you get 2 20 minute workouts and then two 10 minute segments.  That means I can put a shorter segment along with one of my shorter cardio workouts or do a segment after going out walking for a little extra toning.  Is it tough?  No, not especially, but it is challenging enough-it isn't Jillian Michaels tough, where I feel like I am going to cough up my spleen at any moment, but it is effective.  He shows you the exercise and you do the moves-they are not complicated but they are effective, getting in, working the muscles and moving to the next group. That I liked.  I don't want to do a million crunches-let's do some really effective abs exercises and then move to the next muscle group.

This was my first time doing a dvd with Gunnar Peterson and I was pleased.  He is pleasant, effectively cues the moves, has good form but is not chatty.  I found his style kind of no frills, just get in, do the moves and move on.

For me I enjoyed the workout and already feel the crunches from doing the moves this morning, and I definitely felt the squats.

In the dvd you will find total body toning-20 minutes, power burn (20 minutes), amazing arms (10 minutes) and lower body blast (10 minutes).  The power burn wasn't exactly a high intensity cardio conditioning in what I would expect, there are a couple jumping moves, but nothing overly intense in that one, but I felt all four workouts were good, basic crunches, bicep/tricep curls, squats, lunges, push-ups and the like-you know old-school exercises-they've been around for a long time because they work.

I used the dvd as one complete hour long workout and felt I got a good toning workout covering abs, arms, butt and thighs.

Will you find more fun workouts?  Sure, but if you are looking for a no frills, get in, do it and move on kind of workout, this one is a keeper.

I would recommend for beginners as well as intermediate exercisers as the moves are simple and there are modifications given when there is an easier option.

Overall, a good toning workout to add to your collection for when you may be pressed for time.",1287187200,12,2355,4.462616822429907
4043340,5,B0030BS1G6,I love this workout.  This workout is great if you don't like to learn a lot of fancy footsteps.  I feel like all of my trouble spots are hit with this one.,1285200000,,156,3.84375
4043341,4,B0030BS1G6,love this video.  it allows you to watch the full workout of your choice or customize several mini workouts to work different target areas.,1285027200,,139,4.791666666666667
4043342,2,B0030BS1G6,"I've heard of Gunner Peterson from the Oparh show and was excited to work out to this DVD.  The instructor was rather boring.  He lacked personality and enthusiam. I felt like I was in P.E class doing basic drills, thinking when will this be over.  When we got on the mat to do stomach crunches I feared I would fall asleep.",1281916800,,324,4.278688524590164

4043344,3,B0030BS1G6,I know workouts are not designed to be particularly fun but this one seemed especially unexciting.  There was just a lack of energy somehow.  I was really disappointed because Gunnar Peterson is such a renowned trainer.  The workout itself is undoubtedly highly effective however there seems to be a missing element.,1272412800,3,316,5.1568627450980395
4043345,4,B0030BS1G6,"This is a straight no-nonsense and strength training only exercise video.  You need a mat and a set of dumbbells challenging enough to work your muscles, but still keep your form.  The warm ups and cool downs are short, but I like how you do stretches as you go through the workout too.

The video is easy to program.  The four workout sections are Total Body Toning, Power Burn, Amazing Arms, and Lower Body Blast.  If you only want to do one section, you can click the title on the main menu.  Click Custom Workout to ""Build your Perfect Workout"" and link the sections together.  You can do any number of sections (1-4) in any order to create many individualized programs.  You just click and highlight the section(s) you want to do.  You can also learn more about Gunnar by clicking Get to Know Gunnar.

The workout contains 4 workout sections and a Get to Know Gunnar section.  In Total Body Toning (20 minute) and Power Burn (20 minute) you use compound movements to work the entire body. Some examples of moves from the Body Toning section are squats with lateral raises, squats with military presses, and planks.  Some examples of moves from Power Burn are the Wood chop (while holding dumbbell, move arm from shoulder to across the body to ankle), running in place, and lunges.  In Amazing Arms (10 minute) you work all parts of your arm - triceps, delts, and biceps.  Some examples of moves are pushups, triceps presses, lateral raises, and bicep curls. The final section is the Lower Body Blast (10 minute).  Some examples of moves are power squats and a balance move for which your slowly bend forward as you slowly extend one leg behind you.

I usually prefer cardio interval training.  However, I like this no-cardio video as a nice change of pace.  To add cardio you can always add a section from a cardio-only exercise video, or like I do make up your own cardio/ kickboxing routines.  Overall, I think this is a nice solid workout.  I don't know if it is ""the best ever hollywood workout,"" but I'm glad I bought it for my collection of exercise videos.",1271030400,10,2068,4.583106267029973
4043346,2,B0030BS1G6,"I was so excited for this dvd to come out. I don't do too many exercise videos but I tought this one was going to be worth it.

8385671,1,B0030BS1G6,"Sooo disappointed in this dvd.  I wish I could return it.  First, it's for beginners only, so if you've ever worked out before, don't even consider this dvd.  And, if you are a beginner, there are so many better options out there. (How about Leslie Sansone or Jessica Smith?)  Plus, each of the two 20 minute workouts (which are actually around 15 minutes when you subtract the warm-up and cool-down), starts with a ""warm-up"" which is really a stretching segment - the kind you are supposed to do after you've finished the workout, when your muscles are warm!!  Duh?  Isn't that Exercise Science 101?  The exercises themselves are ""same old, same old"", the identical ones that you've seen everywhere else.  In addition, each of the two main workouts repeat these same exercises, just with slight differences.  Super boring and uninspiring.  I would never have wasted  my money on this dvd, if there hadn't been so many good reviews here.  I just don't get it.  But, my advice, is to save your money.",1516752000,,999,4.738372093023256

8385678,5,B0030BS1G6,"If you are looking to tone up this will help you.  There is nothing fancy about this at all.  It is filmed in a fitness studio with the most generic workout music ever and Gunnar isn't a peppy, upbeat or motivational instructor but he does good (but simple) cuing and the workout is pretty effective.

All you need is a set a weights and a mat.  There are 2 20 minute total body toning sections and 2 10 minute ones, one focuses on the upper body and the other the lower body.  They are pretty standard moves that if you have exercised before, you have probably seen and done.  The warm up and cool down is the same for all the sections.  Again, it's not fancy and I don't even know how effective it was.  I don't enjoy the warm up or cool down at all in this DVD.

There isn't cardio so if you are looking for that, look elsewhere.  But if you are looking to tone up this will help you to reach your goals.",1446422400,,907,4.073446327683616
