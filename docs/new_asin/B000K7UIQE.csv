8154909,4,B000K7UIQE,"As a player for over 50 years and a teacher/counselor for over 40 of those years, I can state there is much on this DVD which is correct and very valuable for the primary or intermediate drummer. In fact, Ted is dead-on in what he teaches. Let me explain: Years ago, I realized practice with brushes produced really quick results, especially in muscle tone and the crispness of my playing. Ted Mackenzie properly focuses on this reality (interesting that in all the intervening years I never thought of creating a rudimental method around brush technique, but kudos to Ted for thinking of it). The Henry Adler technique that enlightens this method will be a great boon to your playing. Pay attention, do the exercises, and you will be a better player.

That said, I must say Ted is one. boring. teacher. I mean, ""prop up your eyelids, get me some Mountain Dew"" b.o.r.i.n.g. I don't intend to be harsh or unkind, but for the life of me, I cannot understand why a drummer with quite excellent rudimental technique and, clearly, an in-depth understanding of the physics of drumming, has to be so boring. Most of us are a lot of fun; too much fun, I've been told, but definitely NOT boring. And, did nobody counsel Ted to create and follow a real script for the DVD? Was nobody available to do some minor editing (or perhaps, suggest retakes) to eliminate the periodic (and for me, maddening) ""uhs"" and halting speech?

Again, I do not mean to be unkind or mean, but the material in this DVD deserves to be a much higher quality production. And, just in case what I've just said is construed to be a criticism of the simplicity of the presentation or the set, or even the limited display of Ted's talent, let me clarify, in my estimation the simplicity of the material and set, as well as Ted's very wise decision to not overwhelm the user by a constant display of his own skill, is part and parcel of the value of this DVD. Like most drummers, I appreciate the periodic breaks that display chops (eg. Jojo Meyer's very excellent Secret Weapons DVD), but there comes a time when you must get to the brass tacks of teaching the material. Still, it would certainly be nice to have a much better scripted, rehearsed, edited, and produced body of material, delivered in a more vibrant and interesting fashion.

This should be a 5-star DVD. The material presented deserves this, but unfortuately (in spite of the technical value of the material), in my opinion the production is woefully in need of a better teacher. I would love to see Jojo Mayer or Carter Beauford host this DVD. Still, even though this is probably a 2 or 3 star production, I am giving 4 stars, if only because every intermediate level drummer needs to know this material.",1451433600,,2733,4.596311475409836
