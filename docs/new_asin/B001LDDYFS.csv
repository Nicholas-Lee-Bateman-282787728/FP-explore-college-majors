3682857,5,B001LDDYFS,"This wonderful documentary about competitive double rope jumping is energetic, fascinating, and at times very exciting. How do these people have the strength and coordination to do these incredible and complex moves. The routines would seem hard on the ground, but seem impossible while flipping and careening through the jump ropes. I loved the film and the people profiled in it..",1227744000,,382,5.278688524590164
3682858,5,B001LDDYFS,"JUMP! is by far one of the most uplifting sports movies you will ever see.  In a time when sports news is over-run by outraged hockey-dads and professional players whining about better contracts and shoe deals, JUMP! gives us a look into the life of kids who love their sport, and love to share it with people- EVEN THEIR BIGGEST COMPETITORS.  One of the over-all themes of jump rope seems to be that ""sharing is caring"" and also that anyone, young or old, big or small, male or female, can excell at anything that they put their minds to.  In addition to the great feel of the sport, the movie contains several gravity-defying action sequences shot and edited in such an amazing fashion, it will make your jaw drop, then stand up and cheer.  Get your hands on this one!",1227657600,,770,4.478571428571429
3682859,5,B001LDDYFS,"I saw this documentary at the New Orleans Film Festival, and it was more than captivating!  The cinematography was amazing, and the story was quite interesting!  It sheds a whole new light on what once was a simple playground sport and proves why the sport should be an Olympic event.  The most spectacular part is how dedicated the athletes themselves are, but at the same time how friendly the sport is.  This is a MUST SEE for all documentary buffs, sports fans, and kids of all ages.  Don't miss this one!",1227657600,,509,4.549450549450549
3682860,5,B001LDDYFS,"I had the privilege of seeing this movie at the LA film festival, and was blown away by both the spectacular moves and the fact that it had me cheering for a sport I had barely heard of. And this is kind of embarrassing, but I actually went out and got a jumprope after I saw it. So not only will you this movie make you laugh, but it might just make your butt look better too.",1227657600,,377,3.909090909090909
3682861,5,B001LDDYFS,"Great filmmaking and amazing kids.
The talent they display is jaw dropping and their journeys extremely inspiring.
A worthwhile gift to share with family and friends.
Jump on it!",1227657600,,178,5.172413793103448
3682862,5,B001LDDYFS,"This film is unbelievable.  The kids are amazing and so dedicated to their sport. The tricks they perform are absolutely amazing.  The story holds your interest from start to finish. All those watching this film, kids and adults alike, felt inspired to go get their ropes and start jumping. Didn't know jumprope was more than a play ground game. Wow! you just got to see it to believe it.",1227657600,,388,4.608695652173913
8317892,5,B001LDDYFS,"Excellent documentary about the sport of jump rope. Well made and edited. Equally interesting for those that have been in the sport their whole life, or anyone with no knowledge of the sport. Keeps your attention throughout by intercutting between several jump rope teams and you get to know kids on each team well by the end. After you finish watching it, you'll want to either work harder to get to nationals, or go join a jump rope team, or just pick up a jump rope and do it for fun for the first time in forever.",1419465600,,517,4.34020618556701
8317893,5,B001LDDYFS,"My wife and I are both teachers and I thought I'd surprise her with this DVD while her school was doing a unit on Jump Rope for Heart. Although some of the story lines were a little advanced for her first and second grade class, the jump rope action was not. Any one who has never seen what these young athletes can do with a rope is in for a real threat. As you watch the DVD you will live through the rigorous training, dedication and injuries that happen along the way. You (and your children) will admire the athletes for their commitment, wonder at their ability, and celebrate their achievement. As a middle school teacher, I strongly recommend this video when you feel that you or your students need a little inspiration; you will not be disappointed!",1268697600,2,758,4.5
8317894,5,B001LDDYFS,"""Jump is an extraordinary film; as mesmerizing as it is motivating!  Here is one movie that will hook you with a great story, entertain you with all of its plot twists and turns, educate you about a thriving community that you probably knew little about, and leave you inspired and hopeful that, through the strength of a jump rope, kids lives can be changed for the better.  This is one film not to be missed by you, your family, school, or community this year!""",1235952000,6,463,4.5
8317895,5,B001LDDYFS,"I am not a regular documentary watcher of anything, so I was all the more impressed with this wonderful movie.  Helen Scheer did a great job picking just the right number of teams to follow -- their stories were well weaved throughout the entire documentary.  The sport itself is an inspiring and impressive one to watch.  You will find yourself thinking about the people in this film long after you finish watching it!",1233360000,6,419,4.712328767123288
8317896,5,B001LDDYFS,"This is an excellent motivational film for our youth. Get them to put down their joy sticks and keyboards long enough to watch this documentary. They can't help but be affected if not inspired by the motivation, dedication , and work ethic of these kids and their accomplishments. Definitely a stand up and cheer(jump) kind of film.  Congratulations to Helen Hood on her extraordinary her ability to capture the spirit of the athletes in this young sport.",1228348800,,455,4.909090909090909
8317897,5,B001LDDYFS,"I saw this film at the Hamptons Film Festival and loved it!!  Everything about it! The music, the athletes and the story kept me on the edge of my seat.  So fun!",1228262400,,161,4.0
8317898,4,B001LDDYFS,"This is a terrific film. Very inspirational and a lot of fun. I had the great pleasure of watching it with my kids, ages 11 and 4, and they loved it. Right after we finished watching, they ran to get their jump ropes and have a go. But it was more than just showing them some moves and techniques and getting them interested in jump roping. We watched earnest athletes work hard and compete with honesty and integrity, some winning, some not, but always trying their best, and for my kids and for me, that was the best lesson of all. I'm glad this film is a part of my DVD library. I'm sure it won't be long before we watch it again!",1228089600,5,633,4.154471544715447
8317899,5,B001LDDYFS,"I doubt I'll ever forget some of the moments in this endlessly exhilarating film. Not only did it introduce me to a sport I didn't even know existed, it introduced me to some amazing kids with awe-inspiring talent. It is a roller coaster ride from start to finish with dedicated and skilled competitors giving every bit of themselves over and over again, and by the end of it you are simply in love with them. Superb filmmaking all around, too. This is absolutely a must-see.",1228089600,,475,4.6
8317900,5,B001LDDYFS,This movie is awesome!!!  A very well rounded film that takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions as you get to know this world of jump rope and it's characters.  Very family friendly and just a fun film fit for the entire family.  AWESOME!!,1228089600,,246,4.304347826086956
8317901,5,B001LDDYFS,"As a lifelong jumper, this film truly captures the essence of the sport.  It portrays the challenges and joys associated with competition and shows the teamwork and dedication required to be a champion.  It also has a universal appeal to all children, even if they've never jumped a day in their life, because of its emphasis on teamwork and perseverence.  This film will inspire any physical education class to go out and jump the day away!",1228089600,,441,4.776315789473684
