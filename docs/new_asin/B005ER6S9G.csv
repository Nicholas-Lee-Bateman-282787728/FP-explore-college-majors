4667037,5,B005ER6S9G,"This documentary is extremely well done with incredible details about the search for, capturing and prosecution of numerous Nazi war criminals, many of whom fled to other countries thinking they would never be found and held accountable for their part in horrors perpetrated during World War II. I am very impressed with the first-hand experiences shared by people who were involved in doggedly tracking down the war criminals.  I personally feel that it is important that those horrors never be forgotten, and certainly never repeated again anywhere on the face of the Earth.  This documentary should be necessary viewing for high school students world-wide.",1326240000,17,659,5.326923076923077

4667081,5,B005ER6S9G,This wasn't the series they had on TV but it is FANTASTIC.  I watched this while doing research on my family and their experience in the Holocaust and watching this documentary about how they were tracked down restored my hope in the human race.,1392681600,8,245,4.568181818181818
4667082,5,B005ER6S9G,I've been reading a watching a lot of stuff about WW2 as of late.  This set of films is amazing!  You will not believe the crazy stuff that happened in WW2 that is in this set.  Like the story of how child torture guy number one escaped after WW2 and went to Costa Rica safe and sound.  The pissed off Jews that almost killed half of Germany.  The General who tried to take over the German military to surrender early.  So much more.  Crazy stuff.,1391817600,,447,4.188235294117647
4667083,5,B005ER6S9G,"I loved this video. It just shows the unending perseverance that these ""Nazi Hunters"" went thru to locate and apprehend these fugitive war criminals. It was quite entertaining.",1387843200,,176,5.321428571428571
4667084,3,B005ER6S9G,"The ""Nazi Hunters"" series seems to be a well put together production, as one would expect from History Channel, but I take issue with calling it a ""Documentary"".  If you are going to extensively use re-creations to tell a true story, you should call it a ""Docu-Drama""
There are interviews with actual principals interspersed with the recreations, so there are documentary elements, but I would not have bought this if I had known it relied so heavily on actor driven recreations. Overall, it is a quality product, but I feel it is reasonable to expect it to be marketed correctly/accurately.",1343088000,11,591,4.91
4667085,5,B005ER6S9G,This series is well worth watching both educational and riviting. I was intrigued and wanted to move on from each installment to the next.  Lest we forget!,1332892800,9,155,4.7407407407407405

8468897,5,B005ER6S9G,"Finally, after all the stories and films about the USA and the USSR's contributions to the victory against fascism, we now have a great documentary on the contributions of the British Army. This is the first recent attempt to do this as far as I know. The film pulls no punches in that it lauds the British Army for it's accomplishments and criticizes it for it's failures. For instance, the country who LED THE WORLD in tank engineering totally dropped the ball in WWII and could never match the Germans until the FIREFLY came along. The same can be said for tactics. The film follows the journey through the conflict of the 5th Royal Tank Regiment and there is some dramatization. I wish the BBC had made this into a series, like BAND OF BROTHERS because it has that same kind of drama. I am an American, but I am into British Military History in a big way and this film is just what the doctor ordered. Finally, the British Army is given THE CREDIT IT DESERVES. Well done!",1431129600,2,975,4.4525139664804465
8468898,5,B005ER6S9G,"it arrived on time and in good shape.  it was not what i expected it to be.  however, it is still very interesting dvd about the ones who hunted nazis for decades.",1429574400,2,163,4.0625
