It takes you through the history of the nuclear warhead, and is both exciting and educational.  You are taught how nukes came to be, the effects of the radiation and the damage that nuclear warfare takes on civilization.  It was very interesting to see from a first person point of view an unstable nuclear chain reaction taking place! ...",976320000,2,428,4.835616438356165
7882021,5,630507111X,This is a very comprehensive look at our history with The Bomb. Williams Shatner's voice is almost soothing as your narrator. All while you are shown  the most horrific weapons of mass distruction. Recently declassified film  from our military shows many perfectly filmed glimpses of their  magnitude. It also shows errors in judgement in the early years. Men walking  directly into hours old craters. Underwater test where our Navy was too  close! Very interesting.,967248000,,466,5.243243243243243

7882023,5,630507111X,"As I began to watch this movie I was fascinated by what I saw.  Each test is bigger than the last.  It is amazing and horrifying, spectacular, yet sobering.  Near the end I began to recall how I felt during the cold war  fearing that some lunatic would start a nuclear war (not that it couldn't  happen now).The footage is incredible.  Shatner's narration is first rate.  The music is moving and powerful.",939340800,4,405,4.541666666666667
