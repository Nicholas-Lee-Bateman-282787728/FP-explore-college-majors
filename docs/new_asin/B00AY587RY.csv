5527283,5,B00AY587RY,"Absence of Malice is one of my favorites.  Paul's life is ruined by a U.S. attorney who leaks circumstantial information to a newspaper reporter who writes an article that appears to connect Paul to organized crime.  Paul's business in legitimate.  Even though his business is ruined Paul finds a legal and cleaver way to get even with all involved.  A good cast and I always enjoy Wilford Brimley's down to earth style.  Very exciting and suspenseful.  The Al Pacino piece is interesting, but somewhat anti climatic.  This is one of his early films and he  plays a lawyer frustrated with the court system.  The Pacino piece is a bonus and a chance to see him at a somewhat youthful age.",1416009600,,687,4.658333333333333
5527284,5,B00AY587RY,"Two of the best movies ever, if you haven't seen them, once you do you'll be a fan as well. As a rule I don't like spoiling moves with a of detail, however, If it's good, I'll let you know and if it sucks, I will give you fair warning.",1410480000,,235,3.72
5527285,5,B00AY587RY,"there's no doubt about it, these are two superior films with excellent casts.  however, can anyone say for certain, ARE THERE FILMS CAPTIONED?  it doesn't say so in Amazons description!",1394755200,,185,5.133333333333334

8559027,5,B00AY587RY,"Absence Of Malice is a great movie.  It reminds one of how the media was not always accurate and sometimes had to pay a price for its deceptions. Today, the media can lie to no end and nobody's butt ends up in Wilford Brimley's briefcase.  Newman is a favorite and he is good here too.  Justice For All is decent as a second movie on this DVD. Both movies play well.  It was a good buy.",1496275200,,386,4.0394736842105265

8559029,4,B00AY587RY,Two great movies. I love Paul Newman and I own a copy of Absence of Malice. This was my first time seeing And Justice for All. Al Pacino is great. I am happy to now own a copy of such a good movie,1491177600,,196,3.5813953488372094
8559030,5,B00AY587RY,"I love both movies, but absence of malice is really hard hitting because in the time frame the movie was made there were not many restrictions put on the Press as far as being held accountable for things they had written. And Justice For All Is gritty, that is the New York City I saw in movies & news reports as a child",1489622400,,320,4.095238095238095
8559031,4,B00AY587RY,Absence of malice is an incredible film and was expecting the same with justice for all but was disappointed by story and acting!!  I would give it 2 stars!!,1483401600,,157,4.413793103448276
