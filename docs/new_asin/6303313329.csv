622343,5,6303313329,I really like this. Espicially in light of 'Straight Outta Compton' being in the theaters. This is a real eye opener on the absurdities of the world of rap and hip hop,1440979200,,167,4.25

622346,1,6303313329,This DVD from Henstooth is NOT the original release. Good luck trying to find the Avatar/Columbia TriStar DVD - the one with the nude except for hats on the crotch cover.,1431648000,,170,4.516129032258065

622387,5,6303313329,"I first heard about this movie when I was a bartender at a seafood restaurant in Glendale CA and Mark C. Lawrence was a waiter. He was one of the best people I worked with there and an all round nice guy, so when he told me about this rap satire movie he'd been working on I told him I'd definitely check it out! Didn't know it would take until it was released on VHS to do so and I never got to tell Mark how much I love this movie! So Mark, if you're reading this...WTG!!!
This is the ""Spinal Tap"" of rap...IMHO even better than the similar CB4. You don't have to be a rap fan to get a kick out of this movie, if you like ST or other rock/music movies you'll enjoy this. Heck if you like comedies that aren't music related you should still find lots to laugh at.
If I were going to compare this to a non-music related movie I guess it would have to be Airplane.
I wouldn't recommend this for young kids due to language, suggested violence and sexual content but adults can kick back and laugh their butts off!
I was so happy to find this on DVD as we no longer have a VCR hooked up....YAY!",1409616000,4,1091,4.032258064516129
622388,5,6303313329,This movie is hella funny! Waaaaay better than CB4. Soundtrack is bumping too. NWH is casted superbly. Mark Christopher Lawrence is crazy funny as Tone def. Rusty Cundieff and Larry B Scott shine too!,1406505600,,200,4.911764705882353
622389,5,6303313329,this is a super funny movie. I git it when it was out first in dvd after watching it in vhs. funny funny then let a friend watch it and it never made it back to my house. Im buying it again. Just wish thay turned it into a blue-ray so it could go into my small collection.,1405036800,,272,3.706896551724138

622402,5,6303313329,"This movie deserved way more attention and success. If people weren't hit with that PoS CB4 movie before this was released it would have done way better. This movie had a great story line, good pacing and very catchy original music. Not to mention being extremely funny.

622404,5,6303313329,"A deft satire of the commercialism in rap industry! Great commentary on how Hip Hop has sold its soul to the ""industry"" of rap. Hilarious and extreme in its analysis.

622407,5,6303313329,"I enjoy watching this movie every time. On the surface, it seems simple and comedic, and most people will take it as a silly, making-fun rap comedy. Its outrageously funny as the inside-joke, ripping on obvious rappers, producers, men/women, agents, and the people who idolize any of them.
Easy to see why it's a cult classic(for smart people from the hood) and why it's $25-50 for a DVD",1372982400,2,387,4.705882352941177
622408,5,6303313329,"I can't believe I liked this low-budget goof fest, but I did.  What's more, I can't believe I heard about it until now.  It's basically Spinal Tap with rappers :)",1371081600,,162,4.366666666666666
622409,5,6303313329,"No really, it's the early 90's East LA version of Spinal Tap.  If you enjoyed GTA San Andreas, if you have a good sense of humor, if you can deal with ethnic, racist, sexist and off-color humor, you need this.",1370131200,,209,4.225
622410,5,6303313329,"Maybe you need to have been alive during the 90's rap wars, but i don't think so. everyone I've ever shown it to buys their own copy. Not just the best black comedy ever, but the top 3 funniest movies ever. Comparisons to Spinal Tap and CB4 don't even come close to doing it justice.  OWN IT NOW",1362614400,2,295,4.086206896551724
622411,4,6303313329,"Although vulgar and possibly racist depending on your view, this is still a funny take on 80s and 90s rap groups. If you like movies such as Spinal Tap, this is the rap equivalent.",1360195200,,180,4.323529411764706
622442,5,6303313329,"This is one of the funniest mockumentaries I have ever seen, second only to 'This Is Spinal Tap'. If you aren''t laughing, you are either dead, or just don't have a sense of humor. Ice Cold, Tasty Taste, and Tone Deaf will have you in stitches, along with the other 'mocked' acts, such as Yo Highness, Vanilla Sherbert, Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme, The Jam Boys (Onyx mock), MC Slammer, and just about any Hip Hop act you can think of being parodied.(PM Dawn, Run DMC, Bodycount (added videos and soundtrack only), LL Cool J, Snoop Dog, C & C Music Factory, and N.W.A.

622443,2,6303313329,"First of all, I love this movie.  It's an extremely funny parody of the hip-hop world and what happens within.  I am disappointed with the quality of the video as it is very gritty and lacks a regular dvd quality.",1318204800,,213,4.3
622444,5,6303313329,"This movie is unbelievably great.  The farcical world created in this movie is so believing and the believability of the acting, etc. makes it so absolutely hilarious.  Saw it first time in 1997 and just had to own it, even if it was 13 years later when I finally found it.  Must have.",1278806400,,285,4.339622641509434
622445,5,6303313329,"It is simply a VERY GOOD doco of a band I never heard of - a film less sexy than Snoop Dogg's baring-it-all but everything keeping on place and logically.

622446,5,6303313329,"Fear of a Black Hat is a great satire/parody. It takes what Spinal Tap created and expanded upon it. Surprisingly smart and biting, it exposes the often over-macho world of gangsta rap and creates a social commentary without sacrificing genuine humor and entertainment. Great film for those who don't even particularly listen to or enjoy rap music.",1249430400,2,348,5.12280701754386

622450,5,6303313329,"Rusty Cundieff provides masterful satire in this biting, funny mockumentary of a hip hop band.  ""Fear of a Black Hat"" goes where ""Spinal Tap"" fears to tread.  It takes on cultural commodication, patriarchy and Black machismo in ways that are both smart and absolutely hysterical.  With more funky catch phrases than ""Pulp Fiction"", watch it and I bet you will be quoting from this movie for the rest of your days.",1186617600,,413,4.788732394366197

622482,5,6303313329,"If you laughed while watching Spinal Tap you'll roll on the floor watching the chronological documentary about NWH, the satirical hip hop pioneers. Like Spinal tap most of the antics are based on factual incidences which have become legend in the hip hop world. Even if you are not a fan of the genre this movie trancends any misconseptions and delivers over and over again. It is very obvious who NWH parodies throughout different  parts of their career, and the lyrics are so entertaining you will remember them for the rest of your life. Enjoy the trip.",1174262400,,556,4.731958762886598
622483,5,6303313329,"The movie draws heavily from This is Spinal Tap, but manages to successfully blend the mockumentary feel of that classic with the world of 80's gangsta rap. The group NWH is made up of 3 stereotypical rappers and they are surrounded by many other characters which are parodies of real world rappers of the time (Vanilla Sherbet, M.C. Slammer). It is not movie with people who have a sensitivity for cursing or rap culture at it's fullest.",1173312000,,438,4.701298701298701

622485,5,6303313329,"One of the funniest, most underrated movies of our time.  Don't know why it was overlooked in theatrical release.  Think ""This Is Spinal Tap"" meets Chappelle's Show.  Wonderfully explicit and tasteless just like the music of the era, and in a hilarious, not offensive way.  Definitely a must-view if you liked early 90s rap music (NWA, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre).",1163203200,,363,4.901639344262295
622486,5,6303313329,"FOABH is one of my all time favorites. My Dad ""discovered"" this movie reading a Siskel and Ebert review. Believe it or not but S&E gave Fear of a Black Hat ""Two Thumbs Up"". That right there speaks volumes about this movie. If two frumpy movie critics gave this comedy their blessing it must be pretty damn funny. Remeber.... Don't shoot until you see the Whites.",1157500800,2,362,4.5
622487,5,6303313329,"This movie has everything I love - rap music, hilarious comedy, and great acting. This parody touches on so many elements of rap culture that ring so true to life. Ever seen the DMX reality show on BET, ""Soul of a Man""? There is an episode where he shows off his weapons collection in much the same way that Tasty Taste does. That's just one example of how Fear of a Black Hat is still so relevent even today.

The commentary on the DVD answers every question a viewer might have and is very funny as well. This DVD will become your favorite, it's great to watch after a night out or on a Sunday afternoon. The soundtrack is so great that you'll find yourself bumping Ice Froggy Frog as you peel out of a parking lot. Watch this movie because it's the greatest!",1154736000,3,761,4.284722222222222

Pure 90's entertainment.  This is a cult classic flick with lots of gags and mockery.  Who can forget Vanilla Sherbert or M.C. Slammer.  I laughed til I had tears in my eyes!  Some of us know a good flick when we see one.  You don't even have to like rap to enjoy this movie.  Highly recommended.",1133568000,4,454,4.451219512195122

This ""documentary"" on the life and times of 3 ""gansta"" rappers will have you cracking up and belly laughing! Mind you, this is a very INTELLIGENT comedy, yet it doesn't go so far as to lose you. The characters are well-defined and the actors are top-notch! If you've seen the movie CB4, and you enjoyed it, you will LOVE ""Fear of a Black Hat!"" Much like the Public Enemy recording, ""Fear of a Black Planet"" the fictional group NWA has something to say about why they wear their hats! I once had a professor in college tell me that the essence of a joke was ""hostility"", it's getting to that within you that provokes such anger that the antidote is laughter!

Because to me it all seems immature, so fake. That's why I love this movie, because it mocks the genre in such a hillarious way. A mockumentary of the joys and the perrils of the fictionous gangsta rap group N.W.H. and they just do it JUST right! The extra features are well above average, including full length videos of the tracks heard in the movie. (I like 'em cause they's funny) The picture and sound quality are merely average, but when it comes to this kind of movie - who cares, right? Regardless of whether you like or dislike the gangsta rap scene, you just gotta love Afro American humor. Cudos to Rusty Cundieff and Crew. Get this movie!",1117152000,2,817,4.417218543046357
622523,5,6303313329,"Fear of A Black Hat is absolutely one of the funnies movies that came out in the 90's.  It's a rap satire/parody movie with a touch of dark comedy and huge load of warped comedy.  It still amazed me that the movie didn't do so well when it came out yet it was a hundred times better than CB-4.

This movie makes fun of many aspects of the rap industry: women, violence, feuds, music videos, etc.

There's a lot of great scenes in this movie, but my most favorite is the one when NWH (Niggaz With Hats, the main group in the movie) and their rivals The Jam Boyz were in a school trying to promote anti-violence.  But what eventually happened is that both groups started to feud each other, eventually leading NWH to pull out one of the Jam Boyz members yearbook showing his as an Editor of the Yearbook instead of a thuggish gangsta rapper.  It then got to a point where they ended up blasting their guns in the school.  It was hilarious.

This is A MUST HAVE for anybody who wants just a straight-up non-stop laughing movie.  I would recommend this movie over CB-4 anytime.",1116374400,3,1073,4.351758793969849
622524,5,6303313329,"This movie is hilarious; I will put in the category of Friday (a little more clowny ). Sadly, it is under ratted and not strongly promoted, that is why it's not even half as popular, and some people who would like it have missed out. Friday is better in some ways, but never the less this is hilarious. It is based on the journey of this fictitious rap group, a total mockery and satire of the early mid 90's gangster rap groups, their  problems, and what they were about; mostly inspirited on the group N.W.A. Also, the actors are aware of their characters, and do a great job. Well, I am not going to say the same things that have already been said. But let me just say this, if you like the type of humor of Mad t.v., Friday and In Living Color, you are going to enjoy this. Get it, trust me.",1114300800,,795,4.162337662337662

I agree with most of the reviews already posted.  If you watched MTV in the early 90's you'll definitely enjoy some of the parodies a lot more but not neccassarily.  As far as the Spinal Tap rip off review -I have to respectfully disagree.  It ""borrows"" from Spinal Tap and it works.  I'm sure Rusty Cundieff acknowledges the influence.

The song parodies, videos, and just the band and their misadventures in general are wickedly funny and just plain goofy. This is a more overt, slapstick movie than This is Spinal Tap.

A black woman (college-educated, oh-so-serious public TV type) is filming a documentary on a three-man rap group from the streets. Calling their mean selves Niggas With Hats (NWH), they're very concerned, at least while on camera (which is all we see) with maintaining their ""hood"" persona.
All their managers are mysteriously shot dead while NWH are ""out of town"" (wink, nudge). Early on they switch from using family members as managers to employing Jewish white boys. Before the film ends, they go through six of these poor fellows.
The dialog between the group and their middle-aged Caucasian record company owner is sidesplitting. With misplaced confidence, the businessman feels compelled to speak street talk in a doomed attempt to bond with his artists. We watch the astonished faces of our rappers as they listen to his ludicrous slang, which dates back to Malcolm X's time.
NWH even puts out a Christmas album called ""Ho, Ho, Ho's."" A rival rap group dogs their rise to fame, each outfit trying to destroy the other. NWH finally prevails, however, when it's discovered that the opposition's lead singer went to a prep school and even edited its yearbook. His career ruined, the antagonist and his crew are banished in shame.
There's an angry Spike Lee wannabe and an opening act, Vanilla Sherbet, a bouncy white rapper who insists he was raised by a black family. The concert audiences are pimply white youth who ape the group's moves, clothing and speech mannerisms and for whom the rappers can barely disguise their utter contempt.
Relating these details in no way spoils the fun, for it's the telling of the tale and the facial expressions of those to whom all of this happens that make the movie.
No matter what your age or background, you'll be howling out loud at many parts of this parody. See it soon.",1068681600,24,1968,4.84272997032641

When Larry was interviewed they made him seem like he couldn't differentiate between the movie and reality. I was laughing to the point of tears. There is also a hosted version feature where they interrupt in the middle of the movie for an ""intermission"". The DVD also has 12 full-length music videos that were in the movie.

I don't think Rusty Cundieff, or anyone else for that matter, could have done a better job satirizing the ridiculous (or should I say ""Ludacris""?) world of ""Gangsta Rap"".

LL Cool J, PM Dawn and C+C Music Factory take a beating. The film is crisp but over eager at times. Thankfully this doesnt affect the movie's flow. A little humor seems dated, but this is still an incredibly funny movie. With characters named ""Tone Def"" or ""Tastey Taste"", how can you go wrong.",1054425600,2,439,4.714285714285714

This movie is to Hip Hop, what Spinal Tap was to Metal.  Either way even if you just know a little about the rap scene of the 90's you will roll laughing.  The scene where the security guards have Ice Cold (Rusty Cundieff) outside of his car, and he has like 50 people with vidoe cameras and even the guy from the courtroom painting his portrait, ""Cuz ain't gonna be no mo' rodney king up in here"" will bring tears to your eys from laughter.......

I caught it on t.v. by accident one day when I couldn't sleep.  Where I'm from, they wouldn't play the movie until about 3:00am.  So my brother and myself watched it.

This ""mockumentary"" about a fictitious gangster rap group's rise, fall and resurrection not only has some of the most quotable lines in a comedy since ""Spaceballs,"" but the songs are hysterical and surprisingly well done (on that note, I also highly recommend picking up the soundtrack on CD).  I have shown this movie to probably 50 other people since purchasing it, and with a few exceptions (people who can't appreciate brilliant comedy), everyone is now hooked.

If you can appreciate satire, check this movie out. If you appreciate ..., see ""CB4"". Rusty Cundieff is a genious as the frontman & leader of N.W.H. in comparison to Chris Rock in CB4. In 1993, I am pretty sure Chris Rock was still on Saturday Night Live and it shows. He was still years away from fantastic comedian he is today. Watch out for any movie that has Chris Elliot in it. (See Cabin Boy) Larry B. Scott is great as the gun-toting member of the band & Mark Christopher Lawrence is hilarious as the DJ that can mix/scratch with his hands and other parts of his anatomy.

If you remember the early and middle 80's rap and hip hop scene, you will laugh your posterior off. This movie is a parody of EVERYTHING cool that happened during that period.

622595,5,6303313329,"On its face, ""Fear of A Black Hat"" is a Spinal-Tap mockumentary about the world of hip hop. Indeed, it does a fantastic job of poking fun at anybody who was anyone (circa 1994, of course) in the hip hop world, and anyone who knew what hip-hop was all about in the mid-90s will be choking back tears of laughter. The film even takes a stab at the age-old hip hop question, ""What's the difference between a b*tch and a ho?""
It's also a great film about the music biz in general, though, taking on such topics as sleazy promoters, sycophantic managers, crazy label execs, and even retail placement.
One of the perhaps unintentionally humorous aspects of the film is the fact that almost all of the music used in the movie is actually pretty damn good, despite the fact that the tracks are originals, and not done by famous pro musicians.  Granted, some of them are parodies and employ familiar song structures...but some aren't.  Interesting.",996364800,2,939,4.650602409638554

7843203,5,6303313329,"Fear of a Black Hat is probably my favorite comedy, followed closely by The Big Lebowski and Spinal Tap, which it mirrors by with a rap group rather than an English rock group.  I have watched it dozens of times, probably more than any other movie.  By far the greatest part of it is Rusty Cundieff, who directed it and plays the lead character as the leader of a rap group.  It's impossible to describe all of the funny scenes because, in my opinion,
it's hilarious throughout.  The movie makes fun of White folk, police/security guards, Quakers, and numerous groups, but above all, Blacks and especially rappers.  I have it in both VHS and DVD formats and the VHS has a smoking prelude with the sexiest woman ever (a blonde) freeing the group from jail.
