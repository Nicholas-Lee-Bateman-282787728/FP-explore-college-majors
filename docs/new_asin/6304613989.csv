7875310,5,6304613989,"I agree with all of the reviews above! These two final episodes are emotion packed! I found myself squirming left and right and by the end in tears.....and I never cry...not even Titanic! These last two episodes, as throughout the whole series, has beautiful music....my favorite is towards the end! They have a twist at the end but a very good twist none the less! It will leave you awaiting the next series...Blue Seed 2!",975974400,2,423,4.653333333333333
7875311,5,6304613989,"The last two episodes of Blue Seed really really are awesome.  I have absolutelty no complaints about this video at all.  The story ended exactly as it should have.  There is no point at which you can stop this tape.  If  you are watching it for the first time or the hundreth time you have to  watch it full through.  Again THE BEST LAST EPISODES FROM ANY SERIES OF ALL  TIME!  A must buy.
Oh and guess what Blueseed fans ADV is releasing Blue  Seed 2 (Blue Seed's second season)!",960768000,2,481,4.2444444444444445
7875312,5,6304613989,"This is the final installment in the 13 tape, 26 episode series, Blue Seed.  This is probably my favorite tape from the whole series.  The ending is a twist of fate that I did not expect.  If you knew what was going on,  you probably felt the 2 episodes on this tape were emotionally intense.  The bonds that Momiji made with her friends and Kusinagi (her protector  with whom she has a major thing for) will come into a major light.  I even  cried, and I can assure you I am NOT the crying type.  Even though many  people don't like this series, it is by far one of my favorites.  My come  back to all the people out there who have dissed this series after seeing  only 1 or 2 tapes is, ""Get a clue!""  This series isn't one of  those where you can watch one tape and figure out the whole storyline.  People who have seen Neon Genesis Evangelion know what I'm talking about.  As far as the style of animation goes, I guess it really depends on your  style.  I tend to like anime in this style, and the quality is excellent.  Judging from how many people wrote a review on the tapes in this series, I  can probably safely assume that not too many people are taking this series  into consideration.  If you are one of the few who do actually see this  review, PLEASE don't listen to the people who said it was bad after  admitting to seeing only 1 or 2 tapes.  If you are concerned about the  anime style, then look at some of the pictures of the boxes that Amazon has  provided you with.  Try it out for yourself, but make sure that if you do  like this series to save this tape for last!  If you don't, the whole  effect of the series will be greatly lessened.  If you do try this series  out and you are really a die-hard anime fan, then you will love this  series.  I do give it a rating of 13-and-up, however.  There are some  mature (not extremely) situations that many younger kids would (hopefully)  not understand.  Hope you enjoy!",949881600,5,1938,4.217032967032967
