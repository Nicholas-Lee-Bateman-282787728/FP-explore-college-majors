2699412,5,B000KZRP0I,"This is good selection of shorter stretches to work with.  I had been bad in my habits of trying to take care of myself, and had forgotten how much I enjoy taking some time for myself for some simple things.  This is DVD has helped.  I am starting to feel better and often find myself doing small stretches during the day.  It makes the world of difference and this DVD can be used by anyone.",1222819200,5,392,4.1866666666666665
2699413,5,B000KZRP0I,I really like this dvd.  I got it because I started training for a sprint triathlon and hadn't been working out much before that.  I didn't want a yoga or pilates stretch dvd because they tend to also want to work your muscles and I was already doing that.  The workout has very effective stretches.  My muscles feel great after I am finished.  The instructor is pleasant.,1220140800,8,372,4.492537313432836

2699416,5,B000KZRP0I,"My mom who is over 70 and I (age 50) tried out this DVD with the aim to become more flexible because we were both so out-of-shape.  WOW!  May I again say WOW!  Not only could we both do most all of the stretches, but we began to see results within only a few sessions! Plus, it's a great de-stresser!  Flexibility and strength continue to grow as we have committed to continue this indefinitely.  We have become confident enough to even add aerobics... You can pick your present physical condition and start with only one of the several 10-minute routines.  Who doesn't haven't 10 minutes a day?  The leader makes it easy and is quite encouraging.  I am so very pleased!  Try it for yourself.  No matter how long it's been since you exercised, you can start with this DVD and then later use it as a warm-up or cool-down. With the emphasis on weight-training and aerobics, we must not forget to stretch for flexibility!",1210636800,150,918,4.509090909090909

2699419,4,B000KZRP0I,"Most of my life I have worked out, and yes, it can become boring predictable and monotonous. Here is a good, short variety, one for each day of the week, so you don't feel guilty about not working out. Choose your workout for the day, depending on your mood or need, moderate to intense stretching and stress-relieving. I use this program as an alternate to my usual lengthy workout when I am traveling. All you really need is a chair,a wall, and yourself! Very well explained, the instructor is very down to earth and connects well as a partner in exercise. Just enough yoga and stretching to get you feeling as if you had done a full workout.",1180742400,72,644,4.466101694915254
2699420,5,B000KZRP0I,These are perfect stretches to do after a good workout. They can be combined to make a workout good for releasing built up tension and to promote relaxation. I like the insturctor and felt she does a good job of directing the movements.,1179273600,27,236,4.511627906976744

2699424,1,B000KZRP0I,I was not happy with this program.  It did not flow and I had trouble following it.  I thought it would go through a program from warm up to doing some stretching.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  Not sure I will by DVD's again on line.,1465171200,,237,3.978723404255319

2699430,5,B000KZRP0I,"I have had this DVD for years and I may have tried it once a long time ago - I don't remember. I rediscovered it in the basement a couple of weeks ago and decided to give it a whirl.

The first time, I found the stretches pleasant. It helps me that the instructor is calm and minimalist and gives straightforward, simple instructions. The whole program is about 50 minutes (although you can also do 10 minute sections) but the time flew by. I liked that the stretches are easy and gentle and are held for just a short time. I think this really appealed to my inner lazy person. The next day I found that I actually wanted to do the whole program again. And so on. The first few times I was just trying to get the exercises right but after a few goes around I'm getting more out of them. Feeling better, standing taller, sitting up straight in my chair, and I've discovered some places where I'm more flexible on one side than the other.

I'm very much aware that when it comes to exercise videos one size does not fit all. I cannot listen to the amazingly perky Denise Austin, for example. I used to receive free exercise DVDs so I've tried quite a few, and most of them I never wanted to repeat. This one is working for me, and I think that anyone who enjoys restorative yoga would probably like it.",1451779200,,1300,4.2591093117408905

2699437,1,B000KZRP0I,Very disappointed!  The stretches are all run together after a long prologue so you have to fast forward to get to desired exercises.,1434844800,,133,4.782608695652174

2699439,4,B000KZRP0I,"I like this tape a lot. Annette is clear, easy to follow, and has a pleasant tone. The stretches are just what I was looking for. I often wake up sore in the morning, but if I do these stretches, I feel much better afterwards. Also, it's easy to do just the 10 minutes sets you need.  I would recommend trying this DVD.",1428192000,,319,4.063492063492063

2699442,4,B000KZRP0I,Perfect in 10.  I really like this video.  I some how ended up on autoplay and could not figure out why it was 30 plus minutes of stretching.  There are five segments each 10 minutes.  You can go to dvd menu and choose a segment. I needed some place to start. I do the first three segments and I like them a lot. However during one of the stretches I might of heard wrong I thought she said you should hold for 30 seconds and I don't think it was anywhere near 30 seconds.  I am doing  some of the stretches on my own outside of the video because they are nice and gentle.  I really like one of  the hip exercisesbecause she makes it clear where you should be feeling it and that made a difference in how I was doing the stretch.  My fitness level is very poor and I found this a nice place to begin with some more stretches that seem to be great for me.  I am trying a number of videos it is hard to find that one that has just enough foundation to begin and for me this is a nice place to begin.  If your looking for 10 minutes which is better than no minutes this might be for you.,1421712000,,1084,3.926605504587156
2699443,5,B000KZRP0I,"I often hold stress in my shoulders and upper back. This video introduced some stretches that I had not tried before and really seemed to help. As a Mom of toddlers, I like the short 10 min stretches when I don't feel like a full work out. I would recommend for beginners and those who are advanced. Everyone can benefit from a good stretch!",1421539200,3,341,4.34375

2699447,5,B000KZRP0I,"This is perfect for people who aren't gym junkies.  Stretching is extremely important as you get older and this dvd shows how to stretch those ageing muscles.  The cover is not representative of the content.  The fact that she is sitting crossed legged makes it look as though the exercises are for those more supple in movement, but that is not the case.  My husband and I are 60 and 70 plus and found this to be suitable for us both.",1412812800,2,435,4.333333333333333

2699450,4,B000KZRP0I,Challanging workout for me. Well put together and presented. In time with more dedicated practice I should be able to do all exercises comfortably. It's an enjoyable DVD.,1408060800,,170,5.107142857142857
2699451,5,B000KZRP0I,I like the exercises and her style. I'm an activev69 year old who needed to add stretching to my aerobics and weights. This was the perfect solution.,1406678400,,149,4.555555555555555
2699452,4,B000KZRP0I,"This is a fantastic video for beginners. There are stretches for every part of your body, head to toe. There is also a series of stretches for those with sedentary lifestyles and those that work at desks all day. The series of stretches that that are geared toward golfers and runners, while these are nice they are a little bit harder, but are very satisfying even if you are not an athlete. The last series of stretches is deemed an ""intense"" stretch, this series has more yoga influences and are more intense than the rest of the dvd.

I wan to be clear this is a BEGINNER'S stretching video. Anyone who does yoga on a regular basis isn't going to like this DVD, it will be too easy for them. This isn't a yoga dvd, it's basic stretching for those that don't normally stretch. It is very nice though for it's target audience. It's not intimidating and everyone can do these stretches, they aren't hard or complex.

I only have one problem with this dvd, but it's kind of big considering the title. When looking at the dvd you may think that you will be able to get a head to toe body stretch in 10 minutes, but that isn't the case. The full body stretch is broken up in two sections, upper body and lower body. So, it really takes 20 minutes to get a full body stretch. The specialized stretching sections (sedentary, athlete, intense) are 10 minutes though.
Overall I highly recommend this to anyone who is new to stretching and has limited flexability. If you work consistently with this dvd you may even be able to move on to true yoga stretches within an few months.",1405296000,4,1573,4.439446366782007
2699453,3,B000KZRP0I,I'm not sure the stretches are held long enough.  Various maneuvers and nothing to intense.,1404604800,,91,5.066666666666666
2699454,5,B000KZRP0I,"This is actually 5 ten minute stretch routines. I do the first 2 daily if I can (upper and lower body). I do the third sometimes too (a stretch routine for people who sit at the computer a lot). The last two are ok as well - I just tend not to get that far. I do LOVE the first two. Make me feel so much better.

Annette Fletcher is great. These stretches are effective and easy to do. I get much more pain relief from this than most of my yoga DVDs.",1404259200,,450,3.838709677419355
2699455,5,B000KZRP0I,"I'm 47 year old man who bought this video a few years ago because I hike a lot and like to stretch afterwards. But, I'm a rookie at stretching, and am not known for my flexibility -- either mentally or physically. :)  And, while this video was not able to (nor was it designed to) do anything about the former, it has been very helpful regarding the latter.

I particularly like workouts 1 (upper body, back and hips), 2 (hips and legs), and 3 (sedentary lifestyle relief). I find workouts 4 (sports stretch) and 5 (intense stretch) to be a bit too much for me, but that's ok because I really like 1, 2, and 3.

I often do at least 2 together (20 minutes total). And, I often find myself doing some of the basic stretches for neck, shoulders, and arms when I'm sitting at work too long.  I agree sometimes you need to hold the stretches longer than she does in the video, but I can easily pause it or redo them after when the need arises.

So, I think this includes 3 sessions that would work well for everyone, especially beginners.  Plus, it includes 2 more advanced routines for folks who want something a little more difficult.  In sum, it was exactly what I wanted... not too long, something I was actually willing and able to do, and effective.",1400198400,10,1250,4.362068965517241
2699456,5,B000KZRP0I,"A friend gave me this DVD sometime back and it's literally perfect!  It covers all the muscle groups and you can do all the stretches if you have the time, or if you specifically want to stretch a certain muscle group, you can do that too.  The instruction is great too!  I recently gave this DVD to a friend as a birthday present and she loves it.",1399766400,,348,4.164179104477612

2699458,5,B000KZRP0I,"She's ""normal"".  Not showing off in skimpy clothes, she is down to earth, clearly tells and shows how to perform moves (you don't need to learn yoga-speak).  I have 3 Annette Fletcher dvds and highly recommend her to the ""thinking person"" who wants to begin yoga.  Pleasant voice, clear instructions, offers options.  EXCELLENT.",1394755200,3,328,5.132075471698113
2699459,4,B000KZRP0I,"Very clear directions for the most part but found that I had to crane my neck to see some positions the first time around.  I also didn't expect the DVD to run from one segment into another. (Probably too accustomed to serial DVD's)
On the plus side, I chose this disc to replace an old VHS stretch video that I sorely missed - pun intended. I'm finding that I get a very good stretch sequence from head to toe and especially in the hips. It's the perfect addition to my usual exercise program of walking and free weights.",1393459200,,522,4.326530612244898
2699460,5,B000KZRP0I,Never would've thought this DVD is as good as it is. Very simple and to the point. Stretches all your muscles from your head to your feet. Especially good when you're tight in the shoulders and neck area.,1393200000,,204,4.394736842105263
2699461,1,B000KZRP0I,"Used this once.  It was so boring - nothing new.  I sold it at the very next garage sale.  Not worth purchasing, in my opinion.",1391299200,,127,4.0
2699462,5,B000KZRP0I,Love this stretch video. Its almost like a workout especially if you don't do much stretching at home. Would recommend to anyone that wants to be more flexible,1387497600,,159,4.714285714285714
2699463,4,B000KZRP0I,"The Mr. and I bought a few DVDs to help with his sciatica and these 10 minute DVDs are wonderful.  If he has just a little bit of time...it is only 10 minutes and you can add time in 10 minute increments.

2699468,3,B000KZRP0I,I like the stretches the video encompasses but Annette Fletcher has very little rapport with the camera and the studio space seems odd.,1370390400,,135,4.913043478260869
2699469,3,B000KZRP0I,I like that the video is in segments so you can skip directly to the chapter that has your workout on it. You have a good streching workout or a quick pick me up (or loosen out) for a specified section. good idea and a nice instructor.,1366329600,3,235,4.0212765957446805

2699473,5,B000KZRP0I,"I've tried a lot of exercise routines, but this one is by far the best to date.  The instructor is clear and thorough with her instructions without being annoying like most.

2699474,5,B000KZRP0I,"I've been having back problems for the past few months, and I wanted to avoid having to go on pain meds and get physical therapy. I finally had a  chance to use this video and I like it so much that I don't stop after 10 minutes, but keep going for a 1/2 hour. The stretches are safe, she reminds me to relax my shoulders, and her soft voice is very encouraging!",1355875200,,362,4.027777777777778

2699476,5,B000KZRP0I,"Perfect in Ten: Stretch is fifty three minutes and was released on DVD on February 20, 2007. Your instructor for this video is Annette Fletcher and the first three minutes of the video gives you an explanation of the up coming stretches. Unlike Perfect in Ten: Ab where the exercises you are doing are named in the video, Annette does not mention any of the stretching names except when you come to the Intense Stretch segment. The only equipment that is required for this video is a chair for segment three:  Sedentary Lifestyle Relief. All of the stretches are basically easy to do and don't let the Intense Stretch scare you because of the name. In segment five you are doing a bunch of yoga moves like downward dog and bridge pose. The only one main downside to this video is the stretches are not held long enough. So if you are intermediate and above then this may not be the video you are looking for. Perfect in Ten: Stretch gets an AAA+++.

I bought this because I have problems with my knee and bad carpal tunnel syndrome, and accumulating excercise DVDs is much cheaper than physical therapy. I have tried lots of stretching, massage, and exercise on my stiff shoulders as well. My shoulders really relaxed after doing these stretches - for the first time in years! The stretch exercises felt so good. Anyone who works at a computer, sits for long periods of time, or experiences a lot of pain from muscle tension should get this DVD. It's amazing.",1310256000,18,741,4.7
2699480,4,B000KZRP0I,I like this video because it is short and sweet and really does get the kinks out. Great for beginners.,1304985600,6,103,4.2

2699482,1,B000KZRP0I,"All the stretches depicted in this video were all very basic, and having a host that seemed ""unenthusiastic"" made the 10 minutes of stretching agonizing.  If you're looking for a good stretching video I would highly recommend the Tammilee stretch video.",1294704000,7,253,5.170731707317073

2699484,4,B000KZRP0I,I am happy with my purchase of the Perfect in Ten:  Stretch.  I really enjoy being able to do a good 10 minute stretch a few times a day.  I always feel better after I use this DVD.  I like it because it has a very good variety of different types of stretches.  It was well worth the money!,1269820800,2,290,3.847457627118644
2699485,2,B000KZRP0I,It's not good as a workout. I feel like this DVD functions more to give you ideas of how to stretch throughout the day rather than as an actual workout. The seated stretch section could be useful for the elderly. I did like some of the stretches but I thought it was going to be a workout and it wasn't. The instructor just doesn't get much in for each ten minute segment and each section is so specialized that I thought it was kind of all over the place. I was looking forward to this one but I was disappointed.,1269561600,6,514,4.15
2699486,1,B000KZRP0I,"I bought this based on the five star reviews I read and I was very disappointed. I bought this in particular because other ""beginner"" dvds were way too advanced for me since I am truly at the start of nowhere and needed to be guided so I could advance out of the beginner stage and this just wasn't it.
The stretch times were way too short, she transitioned from one stretch to another way too fast, and one of the stretches required a wall and I don't have a wall to use.
To be clear, I understand this is a 10 minute stretch routine but I think she just threw different ones to make it seem like it is more than it really is. Less ""variety"" in the stretches she did would have been better.
If you learn the routines from memory then you can do it on your own to get that deep stretch you are after.. then again.. it kinda defeats the point of buying a dvd to guide you no?",1265673600,9,874,4.057803468208093
2699487,5,B000KZRP0I,"This is a fantastic video.  It's not elegant or fancy.  No beautiful studio or scenery.  Just down to earth instruction.  If you do this whole video, I don't think there's a muscle in your body that you won't stretch.  I use it by itself, in it's entirety, one segment at a time, mix and match, and before and/or after other exercise videos.  It is really opening up my body.  I have areas that have been tight for years that are beginning to relax.  I look forward to these stretches even on days when I don't have time or don't feel like exercising.  Very well done.",1262822400,2,568,4.333333333333333
2699488,4,B000KZRP0I,"Whether you are working out on regular basis or not, this routine will be beneficial to you.
Aside from increasing flexibility, it is very relaxing and it helps me fall asleep.  Highly recommended!",1261612800,5,197,4.96969696969697
2699489,3,B000KZRP0I,"I mainly wanted this for the leg /hip stretches. I was a little disappointed because it required having a wall to use for one of the series and I just don't have wall space in a place where the tv is still visible. But I am guessing this isn't a common problem. The 10 minutes goes by so fast. Its a little hard the first time through since there is almost no time allowed for the transitions and figuring out what you are supposed to be doing, but that makes sense since it only has 10 minutes to get through everything, can't spend too much time explaining. I am sure the next couple times through will be much better.",1258934400,4,620,4.218487394957983
2699490,5,B000KZRP0I,I am pleased with this DVD.  There is the perfect amount of stretches for 10 minutes or 50 minutes.  Whatever the time you have.,1251936000,,128,4.291666666666667
2699491,2,B000KZRP0I,"Excellent production quality. But the stretches are a little advanced for me. The video assumes that you already have a certain degree of flexibility, such as the ability to sit cross legged. I am using Bob Anderson's Stretching DVD because it starts at the beginning.",1247184000,11,268,4.977777777777778
2699492,5,B000KZRP0I,"These are wonderful stretches.  I've been doing them often and really feel more limber and better than I did a few weeks ago.
Try it!",1245024000,,133,4.32
2699493,4,B000KZRP0I,"I really like this stretch DVD. The instructor is very pleasant with no fancy music or props. Just what I like. These stretches are basic but work amazingly well. I think she holds the stretches just the right amount of time and the pace is perfect - not too fast or slow. Good for beginners, athletes, and anyone looking for a good overall stretch that isn't too difficult. The DVD is broken up in five 10 minute stretch routines. You can play all of them for a really great 50 minute stretch workout, or pick only a few for a shorter workout. Number 5 workout, is the most challenging stretch that brings a little bit of yoga into the routine. I do this DVD twice a week in the morning before I start my day, but could be done in the evening right before bed. It's nice and relaxing. I recommend this to people who want a not too difficult, overall body, stretch routine. I just wish there were more stretch routines on this DVD because it's that good!",1243987200,33,954,4.335195530726257
2699494,4,B000KZRP0I,"I was expecting a bit more from this DVD, having just gotten used to the Ballet workout one I ordered not long ago. This DVD is VERY low intensity so good for ABSOLUTE beginners or older folk. I wasn't expecting it to be so easy (and I still consider myself a beginner).

The positives are:

Very achievable, gives basic feeling of stretch - easily accomplishable
She has a lovely voice and is very calm. I found it nice to be in her company.
Nice setting, indoors but SIMPLE and no clutter. It helps to provide a serene feel. She's in a wooden floor studio with nothing but herself and a mat.

Negatives:

The division of the stretches into 10 minute lots is really not needed as they are so easy. This is evidenced by many people's reviews on here saying that they just did the whole DVD through.

The hold time is TOO SHORT as is mentioned by others, but you can add in a few seconds and still keep up with her.

Overall good, but I'd use it for a slow day. I'll use my other DVDs for days I have more oomph and save this for when I'm not very energetic or keen.",1236643200,11,1065,4.170731707317073
2699495,5,B000KZRP0I,"This stretch tape is absolutely a perfect 10.  I have health issues with my muscles, but I was able to do the much needed stretches and knew they were doing me good.  It will even tax those in tip top shape.  I highly recommend this tape to anyone of any age.",1233532800,3,259,4.03921568627451
2699496,3,B000KZRP0I,I agree with Amelie Bolduc...The stretch hold times are too short and I myself am trying to master the streches in my memory so I can do them without the dvd.  That's the only complaint I have.  The type of stretches offered are a great variety for the different type of lifestyles u may have.,1230854400,11,293,4.3090909090909095
2699497,4,B000KZRP0I,"This is a good DVD showing good techniques. I would give it a five-star if the instructor wasn't flying through each exercise. You're supposed to get a good stretch by staying 20 seconds in the same position. But that would go against the way the DVD was marketed: Perfect in 10 minutes. The DVD should really be called ""Perfect in 20"". I have memorized the stretches and now stretch without the DVD.",1229385600,26,400,4.569444444444445
2699498,5,B000KZRP0I,"I know I need to stretch. My body tells me so from the aches in my neck and shoulders, to the pains in my hips, knees, and feet. Most stretches rely on yoga-type poses. I don't really like yoga. I just wanted good, basic athletic type stretches that I could work into, and not have to feel like a pretzel or have some mystical experience.

This DVD was for me. The are five 10 minute segments, so you can do as little as 10 minutes, or more if needed:

Upper Body, Back & Hips (my personal favorite all over stretch)
Hips and legs (another good one for runners & walkers)
Sedentary lifestyle (for those stuck behind a computer, or with neck and upper back issues)
Sports Stretch (designed for golfers or racquet sports players. I like it since I have shoulder and carpal tunnel issues)
Intense Stretch which is, you guessed it,  based on yoga.

Annette Fletcher cues well, encourages deep breathing, and ""letting the stretch happen."" She has a pleasant voice and is not annoying or screeching (Denise Austin). My flexibility has improved and so have the pains in my hips and knees. You don't think this is doing that much for you, until you stop doing it!

I use this DVD after more strenuous workouts, after my 3 mile brisk walk, or when my neck and shoulders feel tight after a crappy day at work and I just need to unwind myself before I curl into a little ball of stress.
I have given this DVD as gifts to others who also need a good basic stretch program. I highly recommend this DVD and instructor, especially if you are not a yogini.",1228348800,125,1540,4.408450704225352
2699499,5,B000KZRP0I,"The short routines and focus on stretching for different activities is what got me to by this DVD.  I've only had a few weeks but I can already see that it's a great addition to my collection.  I've just started doing yoga and it is amazing.  This won't replace my yoga, but I like that the instructor has combined sports stretching with some poses from yoga, Pilates and dance to come up with an interesting and effective stretching program.",1225929600,9,442,4.569620253164557
