6300433,5,B00IWS74WO,"I have always loved Perry Mason.  Of course, I cannot wait to get more.
Just in case someone doesn't remember these, the Perry Mason Returns is when he comes back to defend Della Street who was accused of killing her boss.  The Case of the Notorious Nun is him defending the young nun who was accused of killing the Priest she was working with.",1417996800,2,344,4.359375
6300434,5,B00IWS74WO,"How wonderful that PM would give it all for Della Street...and why not. She has given her all for him through the years of dedicated service to him. This movies alone is priceless and very dear to our hearts (those of us who love all the PM characters, that is.) Oh and a nun who needs defending...well, Perry has his hands full with this one.",1414195200,3,343,4.292307692307692
6300435,5,B00IWS74WO,"Perry Mason was an innovative series from 1957-1966. The return in a two hour movie format was great for its fans. These films are clever, well made and well acted. Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale are top actors. And Hale real life son, William Katt is very good as Paul Drake, Jr. Entertaining and recommended.",1410825600,4,309,4.636363636363637

6300437,5,B00IWS74WO,"I was thrilled back in 1985 when it was announced that NBC and producers Dean Hargrove and Fred Silverman had convinced Raymond Burr to return to television to reprise his role as famed attorney Perry Mason in the two-hour television event ""Perry Mason Returns"".  With Barbara Hale back at his side as Della Street the film was an overwhelming success and more episodes were ordered.  The two hour format proved to be perfect and over the next several years a total of 27 films were made.  ""Perry Mason Double Feature 1"" offers up the first two films in the series.  ""Perry Mason Returns"" is a fine effort whereby our hero resigns his judgeship to defend his old friend Della Street who has been falsely accused of murder.  Personally, I preferred the second film ""The Case of the Notorious Nun"" featuring Timothy Bottoms as Father Thomas O'Neil and Michele Green as Sister Margaret, a nun who has also been accused of murder.  I found Ms. Green's performance to be especially compelling.  Meanwhile, William Katt does a workmanlike job as private detective Paul Drake Jr.

If you enjoyed the original ""Perry Mason"" series as much as I did then you are probably going to want to own all of these films.  For me these two hour movies were ""must see"" TV back in the day.  This is good clean entertainment that can be enjoyed by the entire family.  You should know that these two films are also available as part of the ""Perry Mason Movie Collection:  Volume 1"" which is also sold on Amazon and may prove to be the better buy.  Highly recommended!",1409097600,16,1544,4.632352941176471

6300440,5,B00IWS74WO,I first saw this movie back in the 1980s.  I have not seen it in many years.  It is a great Perry Mason who done it movie.  Someone was hired to kill a Priest for obvious reasons by the man or men who were out for killing a Priest.,1403395200,,231,3.673469387755102

6300443,5,B00IWS74WO,"In my opinion, nothing will ever replace the original Perry Mason Series, but I now own all of those. It's strange for me because when the new Perry Mason T.V. Series first appeared on television I just wasn't interested. I bought this double feature just to see if I would like it and to my surprise I do. Della Street, guilty of murder? I don't think Ms. Street could kill or hurt anything and in this movie she is as lovely as ever. Great to see her and Perry back together. I will be buying more of these double feature movies, they're quite good.",1450483200,,551,4.3076923076923075

6300445,5,B00IWS74WO,"I just love this two hour movies. I think he looked so good with his senior look than when he was a younger guy on the old TV series. The slue of movies he made in the 80's are best to watch especially since the weather will change to winter.

He was a great actor as is Katt and/or Moses and the great Barbara Hale. As Mr. Burr once said on the Charlie Rose PBS show, the 2-hour Format and he was absolute right. Don't stop at the 9 years of B&W series, keep building your collection to its final end. You won't go wrong.",1440460800,,400,4.141025641025641

In usual Perry Mason fashion this first of a series of 'mature Mason/Street' films continue outstanding legal careers to resolve yet another, but extra-special, criminal action.
