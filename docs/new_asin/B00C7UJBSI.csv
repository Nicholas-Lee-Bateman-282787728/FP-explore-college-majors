8578440,5,B00C7UJBSI,"This dvd is an absolute joy.  A virtually unknown composer is given a new hearing after centuries of neglect.  The music might appear to be a bit of fluff, but the performance by the vocalists and period instrument orchestra done in a theater contemporary to the music sheds light on composers that time has forgotten.  Not only is the performance done with warmth and understanding, but all the trappings of costumes, scenery and Baroque stage props add to the lustre of this dvd.  An added bonus is a detailed visual trip to the restored theatre; its surroundings and history.  Buy and enjoy this disc; you won't regret it.  JHR",1398643200,,630,4.73394495412844
8578441,5,B00C7UJBSI,"This production is staged in the Baroque Theatre of Cesky Krumlov Castle, and tries to re-create the atmosphere of the 18th century, using candles to light the stage. Even the musicians were made to play in candlelight, and wore wigs as they would have back in the 18th century.

Giuseppe Scarlatti is probably the third most important composer of the Scarlatti family after the father and son pair of Alessandro and Domenico, and is believed to be either a cousin or nephew of Domenico. Although popular in his time, he is largely forgotten today, perhaps a little unfairly. Although not as musically sophisticated as the operas of Mozart and Haydn, the music of this opera is still very pleasant, and in my opinion brings out the comedic qualities of the opera very nicely. In fact, I personally find this one funnier than Mozart's better known Da Ponte operas (Le Nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni and Cosi fan Tutte).

However, I would actually debate on whether or not this should be classified as a Baroque opera. While it has some elements of typical Baroque operas, such as extensive use of the Basso Continuo, with the overture having the typical fast-slow-fast structure of most Italian opera overtures, I find that the musical structure also bears a clear resemblance to later operas of the Classical period. In fact, if you have heard some of the opera arias by Haydn, Galuppi or J.C. Bach, you'll find that the arias in this opera somewhat bear a resemblance to them. Therefore, I would actually consider this opera more Rococo/Galante than Baroque, though since I'm not a musicologist, I may be wrong. And since it premiered in 1768, which was quite some time after the traditional end of the Baroque period in 1750, it's perhaps not surprising that the musical structure isn't completely Baroque.

That the all-Czech cast performs well, with beautiful singing and convincing acting. In all, I will recommend this as a fine example of an opera of the not-so widely known Rococo style (at least compared to the Baroque style before it, and Classical style after it). I would say for those who can appreciate classical music, I high recommend this DVD as an example of a good but lesser known work.",1397865600,2,2206,4.830687830687831
8578442,5,B00C7UJBSI,"This is a marvelous performance by itself and it is so enjoyable, even people with no knowledge of opera can enjoy it immensely. This is the result of excellent staging along with great singers, musicians and many many others. The Castle Theatre was restored by long years of hard work from a terrible condition the WWII had caused, thanks to the people headed by Dr. Pavel Slavko for the restoration. Without their efforts, we would have lost the cultural treasure of the Europe. The stage lighting with candles and oil lamps are incredibly beautiful to the level we do not usually see in modern theaters. Musicians wear costumes of the era reproduced from the original still safely stored in the castle. Some sceneries were the original ones and human power moves everything on the stage. No, no electric power. This performance made us realize what we had lost by modernization. They had real good time a few hundred years ago. T.K.OHSKA",1393977600,,940,4.84472049689441

It is just a delight and very true to itself, an old, unknown bit of a masterpiece so lovingly assembled and performed.",1382918400,,319,4.482758620689655

8578445,4,B00C7UJBSI,"Dove  amore  gelosia was the first opera to be performed in the newly renovated theatre of esk Krumlov Castle in 1768, and as such it seemed appropriate then to choose this rare work to be the first opera performed in this UNESCO heritage site when it was restored to its full glory in 2011. There's historical justification alone in reviving this extremely rare work, but the opera itself isn't without merit either, even if the name of Giuseppe Scarlatti means little nowadays.

You can guage a few things about Dove  amore  gelosia (Where there is Love, there is Jealousy) from the title alone, and the fact that it is an opera buffa written in 1768. You would expect the comedy to play out along similar lines to Mozart's Le Nozze di Figaro or Cos Fan Tutte, and those examples will give you a good idea of the tone of the comedy and the arrangements if not the exact musical quality. Haydn might be a closer point of comparison, since the work was also written to commission for a royal court. Scarlatti's treatment obviously can't hold up to the sophistication of Mozart's or indeed Haydn's treatment of the opera buffa, but this is nonetheless as delightful an example of this kind of work as you'll find.

Written for only four roles, it's also a much more simple affair than one of Mozart's comedies. The four principals are, inevitably, divided into two couples - one from the nobility and one from the servant class. The ladies are unhappy that their lovers are either too jealous or not jealous enough and decide that both men need to be taught a lesson. So yes, you can expect a plot to involve letters falling into the wrong hands, disguises requiring cross-dressing that result in mistaken identities, with people grasping the wrong end of the stick. And that's exactly what you get. Dove  amore  gelosia is skillfully arranged if not particularly inspired in this respect, but it's a light, undemanding and enjoyable entertainment.

The music likewise is light and pleasant, with clever little solo arias bemoaning the inconstancy of one's lover and some playful little duets that keep the comic interaction going, and they are delightfully sung and performed by the cast here. What's also notable about this particular production is that, since esk Krumlov Castle is the only authentic working Baroque theatre in the world, it's performed as close to period authenticity as possible. All the props, backdrops and stage effects are operated using the original rope and pulley systems (and it's most impressive to see these in action), the costumes and setting are period - with even the conductor and orchestra wearing period costumes and wigs - and the whole stage is entirely illuminated by candlelight.

This is a lovely production then, sung well by a good cast, performed with verve and with a feel for the qualities of the work, its arrangements and its intentions. The filmmakers want you to get an impression of just how authentic this is and there are consequently a few backstage cutaways to show the mechanical effects in operation, but for the most part Dove  amore  gelosia is filmed like any other opera performance and it looks marvellous. The quality of the High Definition image in the Blu-ray is excellent even though it is shot by candlelight, and the audio tracks give a wonderful brightness and clarity to the musical performances and the singing. The BD also has an interesting 52-minute documentary on the history and renovation of esk Krumlov. The disc is compatible for all-regions and has subtitles in English, French, German, Japanese and Korean.",1370217600,11,3589,4.884868421052632
