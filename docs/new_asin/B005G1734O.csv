4687058,4,B005G1734O,"In recent years, a substantial number of BBC programs have been broadcast on American television (usually on PBS stations or BBC America), and this DVD set contains Christmas-themed episodes of several classic BBC drama series.

People who like British TV drama will love this set.

Although I rate this four stars out of five, fans of British television drama will---and should---give this box set five stars.

If you know someone who loves great British TV drama, buy this box set, and give it to them a week or so before Christmas so they can enjoy it in the final days leading up to December 25th as well as on Christmas itself.",1348444800,6,632,4.675675675675675

8470978,5,B005G1734O,I bought this set of 5 BBC specials in 2013 and just finished watching again. I enjoyed them all. My favorite is Lark Rise to Candleford Christmas. I just noticed Amazon has it marked down from $19.98 to $6.99. That is an awesome price!!!,1416528000,,238,4.431818181818182
8470979,5,B005G1734O,I purchased this for really only one reason.  The Lark Rising series is one of my favorite and wanted to see the Christmas celebration.  Enjoyed greatly.,1391904000,,153,4.846153846153846
8470980,4,B005G1734O,"All Creatures Great and Small is a delightful story, but then so were all 87 episodes. Monarch of the Glen is an enjoyable Christmas tale as well. I'd never seen Ballykissangel or Lovejoy before and found them interesting though not my favorites. My last choice would be the Lark Rise to Candleford Christmas episode which I found to be just creepy and certainly not a very uplifting or fun holiday episode. Still, the collection is a good value and most are fun to watch.",1368057600,,472,4.630952380952381
8470981,2,B005G1734O,I wish the films lived up to their drama hype...but mostly they are even short of slap stick...a real disappointment,1358380800,,116,4.85
8470982,5,B005G1734O,"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you are a fan of BBC at all this is a winner. I am a fan of Monarch of the Glen and had never seen the Christmas special.........nice surprise
