8582101,2,B00CIOFYDO,"Poorly done movie and human drama set in a British club. I only bought it to see Brad Gordon, and they could have used him more effectively with flashbacks. Not worth the money.",1420329600,,177,4.393939393939394
8582102,4,B00CIOFYDO,"Those who have heard of Simon Rumley in America are likely to be familiar with his work in horror anthologies above all else. Though his psychological thriller Red, White and Blue was met with acclaim, we have only seen installments among many other directors since then. The last portion of Little Deaths was Rumley's, and one of the most tasteless sequences of The ABCs of Death also belongs to this British filmmaker. These films were my first impression of Rumley as a filmmaker, which is a shame.

I would have gone ahead thinking that he was just another tasteless horror director had I not been introduced to these three independent British films. He has fallen a great deal as an artist with the increase of a budget and international acclaim, which is apparent by the fact that these three lower-than-low budget films are far more engaging. These films are dialogue heavy and solidly acted, while his latest additions to cinema have been less thought-provoking and more visceral. These three films set in 1990s London are inspired by Richard Linklater's first three films, Slacker, Dazed and Confused and Before Sunrise, though I found there to be aspects of Mike Leigh's Naked and some of John Cassavetes' classics.

The final film is Club Le Monde (2002), which is clearly the most polished filmmaking with the same well-written dialogue fueling a plot-free narrative. Club Le Monde is full of short vignettes and storylines of various characters out for an evening of drinking, drugs, sex and occasional dancing at a London club in 1993. It is easy to see a comparison between this film and Dazed and Confused. Though both take on different places and time periods, both attempt the same immersion into the experience through a variety of expected characters and typical conversations. The DVD includes a director's commentary, premiere party footage, and even a few deleted scenes. There is also a trailer.
