900158,1,6304578474,"I actually went to the theatre to see this movie.  I was excited because I like Danny Glover and Joe Pesci, and the thought about them doing a movie together intrigued me.
As I sat there in the darkened theatre, I kept  wondering when the movie would start to get funny.  The preview looked  good... then I realized something - the preview was funny because it  managed to cram in all the good jokes into that one teeny preview.  After  awhile, I started wondering when the movie was going to be over.  I could  have watched the preview, saved eight bucks and been satisfied.
I love  comedy, and I've seen my share of dorky comedies, but who hasn't?  Maybe I  was trying too hard to pull a laugh from this movie.  I think I laughed a  couple of times, but most of the jokes fell flat, and the plot was  painfully silly and predictable.
My only regret was that Joe Pesci and  Danny Glover actually put their time and effort into doing ""Gone  Fishin'"".  I don't know what possessed them to be in it.  They played  a pair of the most unrealistic, unbelievable, juvenille guys I've ever  seen.  I don't know any grown men who act like that.  Even when they are  watching a football game with their buddies.
Sad, sad, sad.  I was  extremely disappointed.",964137600,11,1249,4.415929203539823
900159,1,6304578474,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't know how they got Pecsi and Glover to be in it, they must have owed someone a favor. The entire movie seems like it was written by a 4 year old. The dialogue is  painful to listen to. The movie starts out with 2 little boys fishing in a  river. It then fast fowards about 35 years into the future. The only  problem is they still have the minds of little boys.  Imagine Dumb &  Dumber with absolutely no funny lines or jokes and that is Gone Fishin'. If  you just got a lobotomy you MIGHT enjoy this movie, but you would probably  enjoy drooling in a corner better. I would give it a minus rating if I  could but 1 is the lowest they allow. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!",961804800,5,721,3.993006993006993

901143,2,6304578474,"Idiotic film about two childhood friends who are now even more inept as ""grown-ups"" dead-set upon completing a fishing trip to the Everglades...but as you have probably already guessed, there is some murder, stolen money, and disastrous mishaps included. None of which, sadly enough, are funny in any way.
I really did want to like this one. In general, the setup is not at all bad, but the script needed about twelve more rewrites. If you enjoy watching Pesci kick a (rubber?) alligator in the gut then this is your idea of good fun. The fault undoubtedly lies with J. J. Abrams's increasingly juvenile screenplay, and while some scenes are memorable (Gus using the blow-drier in the dead of night, for example) most are simply forgettable exercises in attempted lightweight comedy. At least it's clean and suitable for all ages, but as I have seen far too often, this doesn't ensure that it's going to be a good movie. Not by a long shot. D+",1424217600,,943,4.721212121212122

I don't think you see either Joe Pesci or Danny Glover cast their reels until the last shot of the movie.

 It's basically dumb and dumber go fishin!.  Which proves that it was not a complete bomb. Yes it made less than half it's cost in revenue but then many a movies do that. It opened at the number 3 spot that week , and this movie is dumb for sure but that's what it's about, two dumb guys go fishin and create mischief.
It's worth a watch when you are in the mood for watching dumb people do dumb things in improbably situations. unfortunately a stuntwoman died making this movie and it hurt the career of it's lead actors somewhat, but in the long run it's not a terrible movie.
 Joe pesci needs to get back into films though because  even in a silly comedy his presence adds something to it all.
The dvd has a very good transfer and it has no dirt or artifacts on it. which you can't say about every movie from 97 on dvd. Even though dvd's were new that year.
It's hard to realize but video stores were everywhere and 99% or more of their stock was vhs tapes then.  Anyways this isn't a great movie it's a silly comedy and

902338,3,6304578474,"Gone Fishin' (1997) is a screwball comedy  with a some road movie
in it, as well.

Taken for its designed purpose - which is to make people forget
about their worries,  make them giggle and laugh - it's entirely
successful.

This one has a general,  all ages or family rating not entirely
surprising considering that both actors play life-long pals having
grown to be older, dreaming of going fishing in the Everglades, FL
after many years working in blue collar jobs.

This is unique for the time spent showing the fishing spots in that
marshes area, the travel done on an airboat to go quickly from area
to area.

There's also some humor surrounding the people skills of  Lynn
Whitfield  mainly, and Rosanna Arquette as well, in the way they
react to 2 married men with kids,  giving them a bit too much
personal attention on account of relative personalities and
attractiveness.

The soundtrack is All-American, with  Willie Nelson in outstanding
shape both with vocals and on-screen presence, playing the film's
anthem.

For those wanting to see the marshes again in another movie, I
would suggest  ""Wild Things"" with Matt Dilon, which was a decent
movie.

The filming is wide-screen, and crystal clear.

In sum, this one is a successful comedy, leveraging the reputations
of both Joe Pesci and Danny Glover in roles that at first glance,
one would never suspected as suitable - as  compatible fishermen
and as comedians as well.",1265500800,,1433,4.855371900826446

Normally you wouldn`t think of Danny Glover as a comedian, and while he`s not great at it he still turns in a decent comedic performance. Pesci, as always, is a comedy natural.

Joe is smoking a cigar. Gus warns him it is not healthy. Joe flicks the cigar back, it lands in a long pipe, which starts a fire that leads to some factory. In the background, the lights of a nearby city go out one after the other. In the next scene, Joe's photo makes front page news, he is credited with having caused a ""blackout"" in at least 1/3 of the city.

Next scene, Joe and Gus are adults, still best friends ... they live next door to each other, in almost identical houses. They have a family and are planning a ""fishing trip of a lifetime"" in the Florida Everglades. They drive down to Florida with their fishing boat behind them. They make a stop at a Florida cracker style restaurant and discuss their plans. A sophisticated British man, who it turns out is a con artist, overhears them. He plays them for suckers, while asking questions about fishing lures and flatters them for their knowledge and skills. After saying good-bye, he lifts the keys to their car and drives off. Joe and Gus look out the window and comment ... about someone having the same kind of car and fishing boat ... when it dawns on them what happened.

The hilarity continues ... somehow they manage to save their fishing boat and rationalize they are lucky, things could always be worse, at least they have their boat. The guys meet a wealthy fisherman who mentions a yacht club in Florida where he plans to go fishing, he invites them to visit. They are picked up by two young women, whom they believe are impressed with their looks and male attributes ... but who quiz them about the con artist. The conman had duped the mother of one young lady, married her and took off with her savings - they are out for revenge. Joe and Gus manage to make it to a run-down fishing camp, which had been damaged by one of the hurricanes. They show the manager a ""discount"" coupon, which entitles them to live in a trailer. While watching ""America's Most Wanted"" they discover that the con artist, is notoriously famous, and there is a huge reward out for his capture ... their goal is to catch him. The guys manage to lose their boat ... they meet up with a yacht and boating salesman who talks them into a trial run on a sophisticated yacht - for easy monthly payments that will last ... nearly a lifetime. The guys go out in the water and ruin a yacht race and run the yacht literally into the ground. They drop off the keys to the salesman declining to buy it.

Everywhere they go - whatever they touch - ends up literally smoking and burning. Things get very testy after they discover a map of where the con man left his stash. He knows they have the map and is hunting them. They do not realize the booty is guarded by Mad Maggie. This film is a hoot and worth watching if you love crazy antics. It is the unpredicatability of the twists in the plot which captivate the viewer. There is a song about fishing in the Everglades by Willie Nelson played as background music which adds extra spice to the wild and funny episodes.  The ending is surprisingly good when Willie Nelson rescues the guys. In the final scene after catching the con artist, Joe and Gus are inteviewed on TV. They are heros and collect the reward money. Initially, the film seems absurd but once the viewer gets into the spirit of it, it is quite funny and truly worth viewing.

902527,5,6304578474,"oh come on, don't listen to the people who badmouthed this one...it's perhaps the dumbest funny movie of all time but that's okay because it works! If you appreciate shamelessly dumb humor, you ought to be purchasing this one right now. My good friend and I have adopted ""borderline eleven"" thing, whenever something exciting or good happens. We jokingly use a lot of quotes from this movie actually. I would recommend this as a stoner movie as well. Some of the things main character Gus and Joe do and say and ABSURDLY stupid, and remember absurdity is a key ingredient to humor. Take the first scene, for example...I would say one of the funniest opening scenes I've ever seen. ""Rolled on the thighs of cuban honeys"".",1093132800,4,720,4.722222222222222
902528,1,6304578474,Looking at who is in the movie you would think it wouldn't be a stinker.  It was big time.  Nothing seemed to work when it came to the comedy and since its a comedy movie that is essential of course.  I had this film recommended by a guy at my work.  Lets just say I am not going to take any more of his advice.  He told me this was one of the funniest movies he has ever seen.,1070668800,4,377,3.721518987341772

This movie stars Danny Glover(as Gus) and Joe Pesci(Joe)(Who acted in Home Alone).They are a fishing team on the movie. The funny parts are all the mishaps, with the 2-day
blackout they caused when they where kids, the gas station accident, the electric fire accident at the hotel, and the lightning accident with Joe. You will be sorry if you don't buy a copy of this and see it",1020729600,3,531,4.484536082474227

I love the innocence. Growing up in Florida and fishing off of a pier in a state park, we ran into a lot of tourists just like these guys. They had wide eyes and couldn't wait to catch the big one. My dad was so kind and engaging. He helped a lot of people make these dreams come true. He also had a penchant for helping an undercurrent obsession rise to the surface and become a lifelong pursuit.  I digress.  It's a really cute movie that catches the innocence and positivity often mistaken for idiocy. It also captures true friendship.  The life-long kind...not the bastardized variety found on Facebook.",1523923200,,768,4.7164179104477615
