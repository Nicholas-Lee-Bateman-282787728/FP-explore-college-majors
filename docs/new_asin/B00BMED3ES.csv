8570779,5,B00BMED3ES,"One of the best westerns ever made!  I had purchased an Oppo blue-ray DVD player and was surprised to find this copy for sale, it's made for overseas markets, not the usual U.S. market.  And, it being in black and white I think made it better.  I live in South Dakota for 6 wondeful years and traveled around, seeing some of the country this movie was about.  I wanted to see if the Oppo would play the overseas made version, since there is no American version for sale.  It did without a hitch and the clarity of the movie from seeing it on regular U.S. television was fantastic.  The Big Sky cast is great, you wonder if anyone else could be substituted that could have made it better and my anser is no.  With Arthur Huneycutt as narrator, it takes you back to this time when the U.S. was unknown and adventure and trouble waited around every turn.  I do with it would come out in a blue-ray version but one thing I do not want to see is colorization.  Telling the story in black and white film is part of the magic of the film.  I've seen it countless time, and will see it countless more, if you want a great western that will make you put off a bathroom break because you think you will miss something, this movie is for you!  And as usual, AMAZON makes getting the impossible, POSSIBLE.  Keep up the great work guys/gals!",1418169600,,1328,4.289156626506024
8570780,3,B00BMED3ES,"This is a fascinating piece.  Directed by Howard Hawks in the year after THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD, THE BIG SKY postulates a highly liberal message about the possibilities of communication between Euro-Americans and Native Indians.  Jim Deakins (Kirk Douglas) and sidekick Boone Caudill (Dewey Martin) join a group of fur-traders embarking on a perilous journey into America's wild interior.  Despite their obvious resourcefulness, they find that they cannot do without the help of Native Indian girl Teal Eye (Elizabeth Threatt) and her ally Poordevil (Hank Woorden).  The film outlines their various adventures, culminating in a climax that shows the two groups coming together - perhaps permanently.  There are several familiar sequences showing the Euro-Americans repelling danger, as well as coping with potential threats within their own community (not everyone is as trustworthy as Douglas), but eventually the community emerges from the experience with a new sense of strength as well as a deeper sense of the lives of Others.  There are certain scenes where the Native Indians are represented as savages - notably one sequence involving drums with strong visual links to Val Lewton's I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE (1943) - but Hawks tries his best to adopt an even-handed approach.  Although the Native Indians are played by white actors, they are favorably portrayed: if people try to understand one another better, then perhaps they might get along.",1404518400,,1456,5.331877729257642
8570781,1,B00BMED3ES,I should have waited for a reputable company to enhance and rerelease this movie.  It was so pixelated you could not watch it.  A definite waste of time and money.,1404000000,3,163,4.4
8570782,5,B00BMED3ES,This is one of the first movies that Kurt Douglas is in. It also is a good representation of the early mountain men era.,1393804800,,120,4.041666666666667
