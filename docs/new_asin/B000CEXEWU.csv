2461509,5,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's stop-motion animations are fantastic and the story line is unlike any other movie I have ever watched.
The Van Dorts and Everglots are two families within the upper class in the Victorian period who arrange a marriage between Victor Van Dort and Victoria Everglot. The Everglots have inherited their title and estate, but they have run out of inheritance money. The Van Dorts have gained station because of their family business, and the marriage between Victor and Victoria is meant to give Victor a title and Victoria a portion of the Van Dort family money. Victor practices his vows in the woods and accidentally marries a dead bride named Emily. They go on a journey in the Underworld and make an entire wedding plan that would be legitimized. Meanwhile, Victoria has a married arranged to Lord Barkis, a fake Lord who is marrying Victoria for her wedding dowry, even though she has none. Through a series of events, Victor and Victoria end up together and decide that they deserve each other and they love each other.",1512518400,,1035,4.820224719101123

2461513,5,B000CEXEWU,"This is the first  Tim Burton movie I ever watched. Lately I would follow with watching others from him like ""Sweeney Todd"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Alice in Wonderland""... But this is the first I ever came across that has to do with Tim Burton and I'm glad it is the first for me, because it is truly magical.
Made in the Stop-Motion animation technique, the characters (ironically in some way...) are full of life and personality. Oddly enough, those who are dead here seem even more alive and happy than those who are still breathing...
Set in mid 1800's in Victorian England, the land of the living is dull, almost black and white, quiet, not much happening. But once our hero Victor (a lot of people wrote spoilers here so I won't add mine) is swept accidentally into the land of the dead (without being dead himself) everything changes, the music becomes cheerful, the scenes are filled with color, and everyone seem to come up to term with not being on upper world of the living world.
In this world of the living Victor's chosen bride is waiting anxiously for his return since he disappears mysteriously. There are complications in the form of a Lord Barkis that has to do as well with Victor's new bride, and also death itself is a problem as we find out later in the film...
I simply adore the songs in this movie, and just wish there could have been more of them... Even as it is, the soundtrack is great as we follow the story. I like the way the butler of Victoria's family is so with his 'nose up', and the scene when dead people are reunited unexpectedly with their living relatives...
It's a wonderful movie to watch around Halloween time, but not only then. It is short, but packed with fun and unforgettable characters. Anyone who likes the animation of Tim Burton will like this one, and I even recommend watching this and immediately watching Frankenweenie which is talking about death but from a totally different angle...
The ""Corpse Bride"" never gets old or outdated in my opinion, and it's one you would want to watch again and again and again.",1509062400,,2079,4.60377358490566
2461514,4,B000CEXEWU,"When it comes to Tim Burton, I feel like his Corpse Bride is one of his most underrated films. I'm not much a fan of the music in this, but the story is so sweet, and endearing, and the soft quiet moments the characters are allowed to have are breathtaking. That, and the animation is utterly beautiful.",1508889600,,303,4.333333333333333

2461518,4,B000CEXEWU,"In the mid-1800s two families plan a marriage of convenience for themselves. The Van Dorts are nouveau riche and want their son Victor to marry into high society. The Everglots have a long social history but have fallen on hard financial times and want their daughter Victoria to marry into money. The rehearsal doesn't go well (there's this really complicated wedding vow that Victor can't quite memorize), so Victor flees into the woods. As he practices, he finally gets it right and puts the ring on what he thinks is a tree branch sticking out of the ground. Actually, the branch is the hand of Emily, the Corpse Bride, who gladly rises from her grave and says, ""I do."" Victor is dragged into the underworld for a celebration while Victoria waits above ground for his return.

The story is a fine blend of Tim Burton macabre and Grimm Brothers fairy tale. The land of the living is almost black and white, quite lifeless and dull, with little passion or joy. The underworld is, by contrast, jazzy and imaginative. The movie has a few musical numbers (much like Burton's A Nightmare Before Christmas) that are reminiscent of Gilbert and Sullivan light operas. The comedy works well and the stop-motion animation is cartoony enough to be only slightly horrifying (again, like A Nightmare Before Christmas). The theme of treating others with respect even at the cost of personal comfort or ambition (what the good guys do in this movie and the bad guys don't) naturally flows from the story and gives it some depth beyond the silly undead hijinks. The movie is a fun, satisfying story that moves quickly (only 77 minutes!) and ends poetically.

Recommended.",1506384000,,1658,4.834507042253521
2461539,5,B000CEXEWU,"In this movie, Victor and Victoria find themselves in an arranged marriage. Victor goes to clear his head and practice his vows in the woods when he finds himself in the company of Emily, the corpse bride. Emily takes Victor down the the underworld so they can live together. On the land of the living Victoria's family has already arranged another marriage for their daughter to Lord Barkis. Throughout the movie Victor tries to get back to the land of the living, and when he finally does it is to marry Emily. However, Victoria finds out and goes to the church. Emily, by then realizes that this marriage is wrong. In the end Emily lets Victor go, to be with Victoria and one day get married.",1505865600,,695,4.523809523809524
2461540,5,B000CEXEWU,"Cute in that Tim Burton/Danny Elfman ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" type dark humor movie with a nice Elfman score, and my 3 year old daughter loves it. While the movie is overall entertaining, I found myself laughing at Finnis Everglot so much I wished he was in it more. Hysterical character and lines. Good stuff.",1504137600,,314,4.833333333333333

""Christopher Lee (as Parson Galswells) appraised it best: ""Begone, ye demons of hell."" The film is a mystery, a mystery why anyone would pay even a nickel to watch it.

2461674,4,B000CEXEWU,"Corpse Bride (2005) is a movie that will have your eyes constantly popping out of your head with amazement, similar to how the Corpse Brides (Helena Bonham Carter) eyes constantly pop out of her own head during the movie. Director Tim Burton never fails to leave his audiences in awe with the fantastical nature of his films. With the incredible Expressionistic animation and hyperbolic appearances of the characters, the audience cant help but be engaged in the movies exciting flow of the events. This film features Johnny Depp as Victor Van Dort and Emily Watson as Victory Everglot. Knowing Johnny Depp has any connection to a movie is already a good sign. It is the perfect movie to watch if you enjoy horror, comedy, and/or romance- Yes, this movie has it all! The film presents a depiction of the world that will not only have you reevaluating your daily life, but will also have you die laughing at its humor. This movie is perfect for getting you into the Halloween spirit, but is honestly enjoyable anytime of the year. I would recommend, so go out and watch!",1480550400,,1069,4.721925133689839

2461700,5,B000CEXEWU,"The day has finally come when the Corpse Bride movie was release into theaters in 2005.  Its a movie that is just perfect for the Halloween season or just wanting to watch a goofy movie that will leave you in a good mood. The movie is best known for its whimsical music, animation, romance, and its sense of humor.  The movie may scare the little ones but overall, kids love it and so do their parents.
This movie is just a great when you are having a bad day and need a laugh or to watch with a group of friends. Tim Burton uses his creepy sense of humor to keep the audiences intrigued and laughing throughout the movie. He is great at using irony like Victor for instance, he is scared of commitment and end up marrying a corpse and in love with someone else and spends the rest of the movie trying to get back to her. This is quite romantic, in a derange way. He also has some goofy quotes for example, when Victor is trying to leave the Underworld a dead women said why do you want to go up there, when they are all dying to come down here.
The movie starts out with Victor drawing a butterfly, everything in the scene is dark mostly black and white except the butterfly is blue. After he finished drawing the butterfly he releases it and they use the butterfly as a transition and the camera follows the butterfly through town.  The town is sad and depressing but once Victor wakes up in the wonder world everything has more color, people are more cheerful, and the music is jazzed up. This makes the movie much more exciting and entertaining. In the Land if the Living the music is soft and is played with the piano.  This is Burtons way of showing the tone of the movie which is very important.
 I truly love this movie as I get older I start to like it even more. There aren't a lot of movies that both me and my younger sibling like but we can all agree that this is a great movie. Its hard to find a person that doesnt like the Corpse Bride. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves goofy movies.",1479168000,,2017,4.215025906735751

Because the experience of others has been so helpful to me, I try to provide honest, helpful reviews to assist other shoppers in selecting the right products for them. I hope my review has been helpful to you!",1462924800,,406,4.561643835616438
2461766,5,B000CEXEWU,"Definitely too dark and gory for little kids, this fantastic world feels like Tim Burtons wonderfully strange mind was completely set free by animation (where he started his career).  The voice performances are also terrific -- more subtle and full of colors than often even very good actors bring to animation.  Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Albert Finney Christopher Lee, and Emily Watson -- just to name a few -- bring out both the humor and the humanity in these wild characters.

The story; an awkward young man, about to be pushed into an arraigned marriage with a girl he' surprised to find he does really love, accidentally marries a dead woman while practicing he marriage vows in the forest (it makes sense in the film, I promise!).  Hes taken into the world of the dead (ironically far more colorful than the almost black and white vision of Victorian England in which he lives), and from there has to figure out how to get home and back to his real lady love, even if his current corpse bride is quite sweet, in a decomposing sort of way.  Top it all off with some wickedly funny songs by Danny Elfman fashioned into wildly entertaining musical numbers and you have a truly one of a kind cinematic treat.",1462924800,,1221,4.660465116279069

This is such brilliantly animated movie. The way they filmed it and created the art was so nice. This is my favorite Tim Burton movie. I love Emily the character in this movie she's so naive and quirky.  She's just a nice and relatable character.  Since watching it this year I did think it ended differently than it did but it was still such a nice movie.  It's a great kids movie but for young ones they might think of this as ""dark"". I didn't. My cousins watch shows like Monster High and on Youtube Five Night of Freddy which are dark so I think if your kids watch those things they'll be fine.

This isn't for everyone but I really enjoyed it. I watched back years ago when it came out in the theaters and now as an adult.",1445385600,,873,4.1117647058823525

Don't get me wrong, TNMBC is a beautiful piece of inspired cinema. But this movie really shows how experience can change a filmmaker. If there was one thing I could change about Nightmare, it'd be the tone. It was all dark and creepy all the time. This movie does well by putting in some vibrant color, some whimsy, and some more likable characters.

2462015,5,B000CEXEWU,"This is an absolutely stunning movie in all aspects. The picture on dvd is excellent or so i thought. On bluray, the picture is so clear that it almost looks like its in 3d. The voicing of all the interesting characters even the minor ones are done to perfection. The stop motion is so fluid and the characters elicit a full range of facial expressions. The Danny Elfman score fits the movie perfectly and the songs are memorable. Its an interesting concept where the world of the dead is colorful and alive and the world of the living drab and dreary. I can't wait to see this movie in 4k and beyond. But for now this is a reference quality disc to really show how good 1080p can be.",1443830400,,684,4.310077519379845

2462061,5,B000CEXEWU,"I purchased this movie several months ago. I remember seeing the
trailers for this in the theater years ago when I was a kid, and let me say,
the movie  was nothing like I though it would be! It was the perfect blend
of eerie, cute, funny and touching at the same time.

For those of you with small children: there is nothing overly scary within
this film, and I firmly believe Corpse Bride actually would teach a child
about the value of life and death, albeit in a humorous tone. Modern
family films present important life's lessons anymore. (For the record,
I have no children of my own, but I am speak as one from memories of
her own childhood upbringing.)

Of course, this IS a Tim Burton film, so much of his unusual tone resides within.
However, wither or not you are one of his fans, do your self a favor and purchase
this movie!",1438732800,,837,4.318471337579618

I think the others may have been pirated, but I figure if I bought one from Amazon, it would be directly from the original producers of the DVD and ""legal.""  I really didn't know that so many of them had glitches and was very surprised.

The movie is very good.  The ""drawings"" for this movie were great.  Hope it is enjoyed by all.

2462146,5,B000CEXEWU,"Released in 2005, ""Corpse bride"" had most wondering whether it could top Tim Burton's magnificent, groundbreaking classic animated romp, ""The nightmare before Christmas"". Although it is very much in the same thematic vein, it is even darker in tone, with its creator's gleefully morbid imagination at full speed. Despite its grotesque title, with a charmingly original storyline based around someone accidentally ""marrying"" a corpse, ""Corpse bride"" may sound like an odd, slightly twisted concept at first, but it ironically proves to be a most inviting and heart-warming film. Reknowned for his weird and macabre tales, Tim Burton here presents a story that finely balances between romantic pathos and gruesome laughs, creating a hilarious and bittersweet animated operetta. The voice casting is first-class, and the mood of the film is greatly aided by the wonderful dark, jazzy score and songs by Danny Elfman. Among the biggest achievements is the exquisite animation. Being the first stop-motion film to be created wholly on digital cameras to capture an ultra-sharp image (which is complimented highly by the blu-ray transfer), the bonus features give some amazing insight into how this dreamy gothic fairytale was created, and the effort involved in bringing it to life. A stunning film to look at, visually, and a true work of art, technically, ""Corpse bride"" is utterly mesmerising, one of Burton's best pieces of work ever (and a cut above ""The nightmare before Christmas""). Enchantingly sublime, it is nothing short of a masterpiece.",1421280000,,1544,5.3580246913580245

2462212,5,B000CEXEWU,"In general I'm a fan of Tim Burton's - his works are almost always worth watching even if some of his efforts don't necessarily click with me (his take on Alice in Wonderland).
  That said, The Corpse Bride is Burton at his best. The story and characters are compelling & engaging, the art & animation a creative delight with humor ranging  from subtle to wonderful groaners.
  While the plot didn't work out the way I was hoping (something that often happens in real life romantic triangles also) the ending was perhaps as good a result as could be imagined in a situation when all three central characters are equally sympathetic and share moments of both quiet joy and deep pain.
  Yet Burton manages to tell the story with humor, sensitivity and jaw-dropping artistic imagination which can be enjoyed on numerous levels (which makes it great viewing more than once). A danse macabre for all ages.",1416355200,,900,4.767741935483871

I give it 5 stars because all categories (animation, cinematography, surround sound, colors, characters, and voices from top quality actors) are top drawer.  If you have a top quality surround sound system and a large TV such as I do (60"" inch plasma), this Blu Ray takes advantage of it and you will have a true home theater experience.  Also, I might add the movie is entertaining for adults and kids alike.  I enjoy this movie in my 50's as much as our pre-teen and teenage children.",1415059200,,574,4.588235294117647

2462254,5,B000CEXEWU,"I didn't think I would like this picture, but it turned out to be wild, funny and even quite entertaining in dealing with a rather dark subject. Victor van Dort is a young man born into a family of the ""new rich"" whose family has an ardent desire to elevate their station to that of aristocracy. The lady in question is Victoria, who family is aristocratic and land rich but money poor. In fact, the only reason she is being married to the Van Dorts is because her family hopes to escape the poorhouse in this way. Victor, however, has trouble remembering the vows and the wedding rehearsal is a fiasco as a result. After being chastised by the Priest, he finally resorts to heading off to the forest near the village to clear his thoughts and practice his vows. He finally gets his vows right, only to discover to his shock that the branch to which he placed the ring, is the hand of a young girl long dead, now risen to accept the marriage and who manages to kidnap him to the Underground. Victoria, finding out what happened to her intended groom seeks to help only to be rebuffed by the Priest and her own parents who don't believe her wild story. Enter Lord Barkis, who has his own nefarious plans for Victoria. In the Underground, Victor soon learns of his bride's backstory of elopement and murder and of Victoria's new intended and what happens after Victoria learns the truth of Barkis' intentions. It is up to Victor and his dead bride, along with the other denizens of Underground to set things right.",1414022400,,1512,4.501818181818182

2462308,5,B000CEXEWU,"No matter how many times I've seen this movie, it continues to delight me.  I'm an enormous fan of Tim Burton's stop-motion animation films not only because I love these type of movies in general, but also because I can really relate to Burton's dark, whimsical, and twisted imagination.  The Corpse Bride, an adaptation of an old Jewish-Russian folk tale, becomes a hauntingly beautiful but quirky Gothic love story under Burton's direction, complete with hilariously over-done characters, breathtaking visuals, and a wonderful music score.  This particular film happens to be my favorite, so I'd decided to finally purchase it on DVD.  As a gift, I received a free Amazon Video On Demand version along with the purchase, which was a wonderful surprise.  The Corpse Bride is every bit as wonderful and amazing as the last time I watched it, which was a few years ago, and I highly recommend it to everyone, although really small children might enjoy a movie a little more on the lighter side than this one.  Along with A Nightmare Before Christmas, this film is a timeless classic!",1407542400,,1082,4.917582417582418

I felt bad for her, obviously, but not enough for me to excuse her behavior. The musical numbers were jarring and seemed to come out of nowhere.

Creating a name for himself in Tim's movies they are well thought and have good meanings and story lines to them with great effects on film and time put into them. I am also a Johnny Depp fan and them together equal awesome! This story has a cute but sad one behind it with what had happened to our corpse bride but in the end it brought a tear to my eye.

2462337,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton is an extremely talented artist who takes amazing chances with his films.  This film is one of those chances since the idea of a corpse bride is pretty odd. The animation makes all the characters seem like antique toys from the 1800s and the setting of the story appears to be Eastern Europe prior to World War I. The art direction is superb, especially in capturing the world of the dead where vast exuberance rules. The musical numbers are a bit hard to follow but the imagery is dazzling. The story of Victor who is about to marry a girl from a now poor noble family is charming, especially the winning character of the corpse bride, a poor victim of murder who was killed by her new husband to obtain her wealth. Highly entertaining, witty, and visually delightful would be the best description of this film which is just exactly the right length.",1401926400,,862,4.561290322580645

The music by Danny Elfman, who also did the score and performed much of it for Nightmare, isn't as distinctive here, mainly because there aren't as many numbers.  But the visuals are interesting and witty, and the story, which seems a straightforward affirmation of romance, subversively suggests the colorlessness of the way many of us spend our time among the living.",1399248000,,525,5.1647058823529415

I had a great time watching it. My friends and I watched it at our Halloween party, and I still enjoy viewing it all year round.

I highly recommend this movie, but there is one thing in it that bugs me: the character's outrageous outbursts into song. Tim Burton is a very musical person, but does he really have to let everyone know that by inserting his musical gusto into his all of movies? I'm sure at some ages people enjoy the silly little songs that the clay characters are dancing to, but specifically to an older person like me, they are cheesy and unnecessary. But keep in mind that this is just an opinion, but to me at least, takes away one of the stars.

2462395,4,B000CEXEWU,"A story about a young man who accidentally marries a dead woman isn't something you'd expect from a film targeted at children... but then you might notice Tim Burton's name on the poster and think ""ah well, that explains it"".

Based on an old Jewish folk tale, the original story tells of a groom headed to his wedding who places his ring on a shrivelled branch whilst practicing his wedding vows, only to find that said branch is actually the rotting remains of a woman's hand. She emerges from the ground, eager to embrace her new husband, only for the local rabbi to decree that the dead have no claim over the living. The corpse bride is sent back to her rest, and the man is free to wed his living fiance.

It seems unlikely that any studio would want to touch such a macabre story, and probably wouldn't have were it not for Tim Burton's reputation for making the grotesque and the creepy into wildly popular films. Returning to the stop-motion animation that made&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nightmare-Before-Christmas/dp/B005ZMTYBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nightmare Before Christmas</a>&nbsp;such a visual delight, ""Corpse Bride"" follows in the footsteps of its predecessor with the usual round-up of Burton's creative collaborators: composer Danny Elfman, actors Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter, and the range of puppeteers and artisans who bought the likes of Jack Skellington and the residents of Halloween Town to life.

Victor van Dort is a shy and timid young man engaged to Victoria Everglot, the daughter of impovished aristocrats desperate to restore their fortunes by marrying off their only child to wealthy fish merchants. Victor's parents are delighted at the opportunity to elevate themselves to a higher social standing, but Victor himself is not quite so sure - after all, he's never even met Victoria.

Yet a chance meeting in the Everglot manor demonstrates that the young couple are perfect for each other... only for Victor's nerves to turn the rehearsal ceremony into a disaster, culminating in him running to the forest in motification. There he practices his vows, placing the wedding band on what looks like an old twig. Things go from bad to worse, as now the corpse bride believes that *she* is Victor's lawfully wedded wife, and spirits him off to the underworld where the dead reside...

When you look at this synopsis, it seems like a remarkably strange film and not necessarily one that's suitable for children. It's dark and spooky sure enough, but it also has some surprisingly mature things to say about the state of marriage, the seriousness of being responsible for your actions, and sacrificing one's happiness for the sake of another. It has a lot of fun with the depiction of the world of the living as a drab, dull and monochromic place, contrasted sharply with the vibrancy and liveliness of the realm of the dead, complete with dancing skeletons and singing insects.

The film is filled with innovative sequences and amusing characters, and though it doesn't quite reach the instant-classic status of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", it's still a thoughtful and beautiful film that expands on its source material in surprising ways. Perhaps some scenes can be a bit too intense for very young viewers, but as a Halloween treat for older children it hits the spot. For adults, there's plenty of enjoyment to be had in the talented voice cast (which includes Albert Finney, Joanna Lumley and Richard E. Grant to name a few) and the pain-staking artistry that is always apparent in stop-motion animation.

Only Tim Burton's eccentric sensibilities could have brought this film to life, and the result is a quirky little gem of a movie.",1385769600,,3745,5.119476268412439

The identification with the characters and the painful moral dilemma of Victor, the story's protagonist. This wonderful movie is filled with all sorts of colorful characters sure to entertain children and adults alike. Great personalities---none boring, not even the skeleton dog or the uppity butler! The main premise has already been covered in other reviews, so I'll just add that the plot is entertaining for children and captivating for adults, for it encompasses an all-too-real moral dilemma where decisions and actions that have to be made are bound to profoundly hurt the soul of the characters involved. Kids will love all the shenanigans, but adults will painfully wonder: ""Oh, no, what's he going to do?"" The characters involved in this momentous decision are lovable, so we, the audience, don't want them to suffer at all. Let the tears roll. Beautiful artwork, colors, music, voices, stop-action animation, and incredible facial expression of emotions. Fun for the kids, an artful masterpiece for adults. See it.

Such stunning visuals! The color and picture is amazing! The Corpse Bride is a great animated movie with a a hint of darkness to it like many other Tim Burton movies, especially The Nightmare Before Christmas, another animated Gem that has such a popular following.

 Taking place in a Victorian like village in the late 1800s. The story starts as the parents of Victor (the main character) and Victor himself heading off to a wedding rehersal arranged by his parents and the parents of Victoria, the woman he has been arranged to be married to the following day. Vitoria's parents seem dissatisfied with the choice of Victor as a husband for their daughter, but overlook it due to the assumption that they are marrying their daughter into wealth as they represent themselves as being rich, which in reality, is a lie. Both Victor and Victoria have cold feet due to not ever meeting, yet due to be married the next day. However when they do meet, they both seem to have a strong feeling of love at first sight. During the wedding rehersal, Victor couldn't be more of a clutz, from messing up his lines, to accidently setting his future mother-in-law's dress a flame, causing a scene and angering the priest and parents who begin to schold him. Afterwards, Victor takes a walk through a forest outside of the village while practicing his lines and steps for the wedding. Upon finally perfecting the vows as he practices, he places the ring on a tree uproot, which turns out to be the decayed arm of a woman who is wearing a torn and tattered wedding dress. This brings her back to life..... well..... reanimates her as she is still technically dead. Doing this also has binded the Corpse Bride Emily, to Victor who are now man and wife.

Emily then drags Victor to the land of the dead, which is ironicly quite lively. But can someone living be married to someone dead!? Victoria's parents get word that Victor was seen with another woman (Emily) and this upsets them which leads them to set up a new marrage for their daughter to a man named Barkis, whom they believe to be wealthy. Lord Barkis however, has his own deceitful agenda. So what is Victor to do when he has accidently married Emily, a corpse bride, but still has feelings for Victoria who has the same feelings, but is scheduled to marry Barkis!?...

Although it is quite short, it is still a great movie! Though I haven't had a chance to check out the special features since I had to head to work, I will and will edit when I get a chance.  Any fan of Tim Burton, or The Nightmare before Christmas, I highly recommend getting this movie. Especially on Blu-ray!",1373587200,,2796,4.517786561264822

2462490,4,B000CEXEWU,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this animated feature, save for the weirdness you always get from Tim Burton.  The animation was good and the voices chosen for the characters were wonderful--I mean how can you go wrong with Johnny Depp and Elena Bonham Carter?

Victor is a young man from a poor family who is looking to improve their social standing by arranging a wedding between him and Victoria, the shy girl from a rich family.  Victor isn't sure about this, but what else can he do?  Victoria isn't sure about this, but what can she do?  Victor goes off into the woods with ring in hand to practice his vows--since he tends to muff them up royally--and accidentally marries the ""Corpse Bride,"" Emily, a woman who was betrayed by her intended and now is in the land of the dead and desperately needs a husband.  She takes him to her world and intends to keep him if she can, while Victor is torn between the two worlds and his own desires.

The world of the living is plodding, set to the click of the clock, and dull. The world of the dead is quick, jazzy, and always transforming.  The way they show the land of the dead in bright colors and the land of the living in muted grays, black and white is a wonderful symbolic contrast.  After all, Victor doesn't really come alive--discover what it means to be alive--until he is taken away to the land of death.

The movie climaxes during a wedding scene where Victor has to make a choice regarding how much he is willing to sacrifice for love or life.  I didn't really like the ending, but I guess the plot is based off of a story and, maybe, they kept the ending as it was.  I would have preferred it ended differently, but maybe that's just me.

The story is sad at times, funny at times, and darkly entertaining.  That being said, it could get slow here and there and, to be honest, the songs were rather bland and uninspiring.  That's probably the movie's biggest fault--not the score, but the songs.  I think they could have done better and made this movie not just good, but great.  I could have done without Emily's main sidekick, as well.

Generally recommended, but not for the little kids.",1368748800,,2155,4.426395939086294

2462495,4,B000CEXEWU,"I am a fan of Tim Burtons work. However, i had my expectations high becuase my favorite movie if ""The Nightmare Before Christmas""...so in comparison, It is a cute movie, just not as fun.",1366243200,,186,4.5
2462496,5,B000CEXEWU,"To start I enjoyed the movie from its look, story, design elements and overall tone. A movie like this was worth it for me to seek out a special edition.

VHS every once in a blue moon came with cool little additions like the lenticular (hologram) covers for ""Independence Day"" and ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"". When DVDs were new it was a bonus to see 'additional special features' listed on the back that included commentary, making-of shorts and the like. Box sets like Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"", ""the Matrix"" and ""Hellboy"" introduced figures, models and busts that gave your DVD shelf and extra something special. Over time that sort of box set/special edition became a rarity. This ""Corpse Bride"" DVD is one that stands up with the likes of the greats I'd say.

Cover: There is a sleeve which houses the DVD and the Book. On the front of the cover is a very nice Lenticular display which at first displays Victor and Victoria hold hands surrounded by the Burton-esque vines and plant work. Turning it (in traditional hologram fashion) reveals Victor's expression change as he now holds hands with The Corpse Bride and they are surrounded by various characters from the other world.

Book: The book is quite a gem especially if you're one who collects 'art-of' books. The forward is titled ""A Very Happy Engagement: The Story of Corpse Bride"" and goes through the conception and early development of the film project. Though only a few pages long it's sprinkled character design, original Tim Burton illustrations and even a color comp from the production. The better part of the book is a storybook version of the film that take stills from the movie. However you will still find pieces of art and original storyboards strewn throughout the pages.

DVD:

***TAKE NOTE*** As of now (when I am writing this review) Amazon does not currently list an aspect ratio under the details for the film. In most cases a special edition is always in widescreen or the original aspect ratio of the film [""Corpse Bride"" was filmed in anamorphic widescreen]. Subsequently the additional sellers may not have the aspect ration listed. When I received my copy it was a Full Screen. I would have preferred Widescreen but upon checking the page I saw an aspect ratio wasn't listed. You may want to contact a seller if you have a Widescreen/Full Screen preference.

Having said that, the DVD still packs a punch in light of special features.

I'm not sure why I got the idea that it was going to be a boring movie, so when it came out I kept on skipping it until now.
I'm glad I finally got to watch it. It was weird and creepy in a nice way, like all Tim Burton's...
Don't let the black & white, the gothic or the strange keep you away from this movie. It has a beautiful story behind. I recommend.",1365724800,,412,3.6931818181818183

But there is nothing I don't love about this movie. The casting is excellent. For those of us who are technically fascinated by Claymation and how time-consuming it must be to complete a full-length feature film, just one look at the detailing in features and costumes will blow you away! This is one of those movies that you appreciate more upon subsequent viewings; every time I watch it I see something I hadn't noticed before or hear lyrics that escaped me.",1359590400,,598,4.872549019607843

2462642,5,B000CEXEWU,both 9 and 12 year old enjoyed it and it made a long car ride much much shorter. I recommend.,1355097600,,93,3.7
2462643,5,B000CEXEWU,"Team up Tim Burton with his sense of the macabre, Johhny Depp, and some world-class stop animation, and only good things can happen - like this. Despite its slightly gruesome premise - that a poor sould form the land of the living betroths himself to a formerly-live beau instead of the woman he intended - the tone stays light and kid-friendly (depending on your kid, of course). In the end, the snraled bonds of affection unsnarl, the good guys get what they want, and the bad guy gets what he deserves. Maybe not the most memorable among Burton's works, Corpse Bride is still a good one for a rainy afternoon.

2462669,5,B000CEXEWU,"I love this movie. Tim Burton is a great storyteller and stop motion animation is still one of my favorite movie styles. The casting is genius with Johnny Depp, Emily Watson, Christopher Lee, Albert Finney, Joanna Lumley, to name a few. There are moments of surprising tenderness that Burton is a master at. It's a lovely story with great music. And my kids adore it so if you're considering it for kids it is dark without being too scary.",1353110400,,439,4.569620253164557

2462757,4,B000CEXEWU,"A lesser effort by Tim Burton and company, it nonetheless has a certain charm.  The voice work is consistently fine, the artwork is brilliant, but the story is a bit of a letdown.  To say the plot is sparse is putting it mildly; there just isn't any meat on these bones.  It's your basic dull boy meets prearranged bride, dull boy loses prearranged bride, dull boy is sidetracked by a wisp of a dead girl.......  It does have a happy ending though, and some truly forgettable songs.  I could have done without the Peter Lorre maggot.  Still, it's peculiar enough to warrant multiple viewings.",1351123200,,592,4.644230769230769

I won't give anything away other than to say that I love the stop-motion animation. I love the story and how everything comes together in the end... Very redemptive story and well told. Great movie for most of the family I would just say that if you have little ones in the house that you preview the movie before you all see it together so that you know what to expect and knowing what your kids can handle and what you want them to be exposed to. It is not at all a terrible movie in the way of; language, sexual content, or anything of that sort. But it is a movie geared towards an older audience.

My DVD arrived in a very timely manner, I believe I got it before the actual ship date and I did watch it almost immediately. Amazon also gave me a 48 hour rental on this title after I initially purchased it so I could stream it to my television through my xbox from the Amazon Instant Video app. I really like this feature of Amazon because it beats having to get in the car to hit up a red box or the video rental store to rent a movie. The newer releases range from 2.99-3.99 for a 48 hour rental which is about the same as a video store but you save yourself some time and gas by renting through Amazon.

2462802,5,B000CEXEWU,"I love this movie!!  I must admit however, that when I heard the title ""Corpse Bride"", I thought this movie might be gory or really scary.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  Tim Burton's Corpse Bride tells the story a young man named Victor Van Dort (Jonny Depp) who is going to be having an arranged marriage to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) who's parents have arranged the marriage, to save them from the poorhouse.  It should be said that even though Victoria's parents Finis Everglot (Albert Finey) and Maudeline Everglot (Joanna Lumley) are cold and uncaring, Victoria, on the other hand, is sweet and kind-hearted.  And I have to say, Victoria's parents ARE scary.  Finis Everglot looks like a fat, bloated, toad and Maudeline Everglot, has a really creepy hair-do and a wierd chin.

Back to the story....
Victor can't remember his wedding vows and the wedding rehersal is a disaster.  Victor runs off to the forest to practice his wedding vows.  While there, he finally gets it right and places the wedding ring on what looks like a tree root.  But is in reality, a finger.  It is then that he meets Emily (Helena Bonham Carter), a half-skeletonized beauty who was murdered years earlier by the evil, scheaming, Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant.)  A charming sociopath who charms young women, murders them, and takes their money.  It makes you wonder, how many other women has he murdered.  I have a feeling that Emily wasn't his first victim.  And personally, I think Lord Barkis is a serial killer.  But that's a whole other story entirely......

Ok, I'm not going to spoil the ending.  So you'll have to rent it, steal it (just kidding), or watch it on Netflicks.  Either way, you need to see this movie.  You'll love it!!!",1325548800,,1740,4.7558528428093645

For Tim Burton Fanatics, and Casual Watchers alike, this is definitely worth watching. I am a huge fan of animation and there is a lot to be admired. Although, I did feel it lacked in musical numbers. It opens strongly with the implication it is going to be a musical, like Nightmare, yet there are very few lyrical songs! There are plenty of places they ould have easily inserted musical numbers and keep the plot moving.

2462825,4,B000CEXEWU,"My older children (aged 20 and 18) have been raving about Tim Burton's movies for years, and somehow it's taken me this long to get around to watching a couple.  This week I watched this film and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-in-Wonderland/dp/B001HN694K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice in Wonderland</a>.  Though the general darkness of the film is not an environment I typically seek out, I learned that Burton uses the overall darkness and dreariness in his films' imagery to build his story to its unexpected conclusion.

The stop-motion animation (at least that is what it looks like) was well done.  The scenery and trees, etc., are classic Burton.  I actually felt for both of the brides and the groom in this twisted tale of wishes, dreams, and love lost and love found.

I won't spill the beans, but if you are like me, you will greatly enjoy the exciting conclusion to this dark tale.

I'd recommend this movie to viewers probably aged 10+.  Younger children may have nightmares, though the movie is not particularly scary over all.

All in all I'd say that I liked this film a lot, but did not ""love it.""

So, if you are expecting the same depth, musicality, etc., you won't possibly like it. However, still I really think it is a great story. The animation is as good as Nightmare Before X-mas (Tim Burton, right!). However, there are only a few songs I really liked (the main theme song and the jazzy song that explains the story of Corpse Bride), so it is really nothing compared with Nightmare Before Christmas. As I said, it is still great, it even made me cry at the end.
The disc also comes with a lot of extras which is nice: from the production of the puppets to how the animation done, how the voice actors dubbed the animation, and Tim Burton's explanation of the whole thing.

I am repeating this once more because it really will affect your judgement: if you have watched and loved Nightmare Before X-mas, you will most probably love this one too, but just don't expect what you get from Nightmare Before X-mas.

2462871,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton returned to his stop-motion greatness is this great romantic fantasy. Once again teaming up with animator Mike Johnson who he worked with on The Nightmare Before Christmas, the brought Burton's idea for a short story invoving necrophilia into an enjoyable family feature.

Taking place in Victorian era England, the worried young Victor is engaged to the very ladylike a Victoria(a joke on Victor/Victoria), but is having trouble remembering his vows. After dropping his engagement ring in the woods, he unintentionally resurrects Emily, the corpse of a bride who was killed on her wedding night. She takes him to the underworld where he learns her sad tale. Victor manages to talk her into taking him topside by a magic potion, and tells Victoria what happened, but Emily spitefully returns him to back to the land of the dead. Meanwhile, Victoria's parents believe Victor has ditched her, so they promise her hand to the aristocratic Lord Barkis, who really intends to kill and take her fortune, although he's unaware that Victoria's family was really marrying her to Victor for his family's money. Victor himself hears of Victoria's new fiance via one of his old coachmen who recently died of a bad cough. This causes Victor to consent to marrying Emily, but they decide to take their wedding upstairs to the land of the living. After an initial shock by most of the townspeople who think that's its a typical zombie holocaust, they realize that the dead are just there for the wedding. Victoria makes her way to the chapel, and Emily notices her just before Victor is willingly going to drink poison to join Emily in holy matrimony. Emily decides to let Victor marry Victoria instead, but Lord Barkis shows up and Emily recognizes him as the man who killed her. He unwittingly drinks the poison though, and the dead guests drag him back to the underworld. Emily then drifts peacefully off into the afterlife, leaving Victor and Victoria to live happily ever after.

When this movie first came out, I liked it but quickly forgot about it because of how much more entertaining I found the Wallace & Gromit movie(another stop-motion movie)at the time which came out a few weeks later. It wasn't until I rented it again a few years later that I grew to appreciate it more. It's got a bittersweet story to it done to gothic background. There's some fine humor in it, along with a few slightly unecessary but still welcome musical numbers. I especially loved the outlandish character designs and dark backgrounds, and how much more livelier they made the world of the dead seem from the world of the living. I highly recommend this as a movie to show at either Halloween or Valentines, an definately one for your video library.",1260489600,,2736,4.844017094017094

2462874,4,B000CEXEWU,"""Corpse Bride"" is a gruesome addition to the macabre oeuvre of Tim Burton. It tells the story, in stop-motion animation, of Victor and Victoria, a lonely boy and girl who are being forced to wed by their money-grubbing parents. But a chance encounter in graveyard brings back from the dead Emily, the reanimated corpse of a spurned bride. When Victor accidentally slips a ring onto her bony finger, she resolves to wed Victor and bring him back with her to the world of the dead.

The sets are terrific, Victorian ghoulishness at it creepy finest. The dead live underground, in a fast-paced society that mirrors the past, complete with bars and dancehalls. The dead themselves are partly and mostly-decayed skeletons that would probably scare the bejesus out of younger kids. Emily is a case in point. One leg and one arm are decayed to bone. Her ribs are visible on one side through her tattered wedding dress. Instead of rouge, one cheek is rotted to black and the other has lost enough flesh to reveal a toothy jaw line. That Burton's puppet master manage to make her look sexy shows their mastery of the genre. There is wonderful macabre humor is well. At French headwaiter is just that -- the waiter's guillotined head, made mobile by an skittering army of corpse-eating bugs.

The film is wonderful in all respects but plotting. The puppets are masterfully rendered in shades of brown (for the loving) and blue (for the dead). The animation is silky and smooth. But a number of plot lines don't make sense -- do not read on if you wish to be surprised! In spite of Emily's forced marriage to another character, there's no real reason that Victor must marry Emily. And there is no reason that Emily should decide to forgo her marriage to Victor when she sees Victoria in the church. And why a certain evil character would choose to drink a death-dealing potion is a mystery. Except that he plot required that he do so.

Still, there are many, many wonderful touches to The Corpse Bride. A scene of a character dissolving into butterflies was unexpected, touching and stylistically stunning. The stop motion technique did not prevent the artists from giving the characters expression and life. The story's unique touches (like a boy reunited with his long dead dog) were clever and original and fit the plot perfectly.

Almost lifelike, The Corpse Bride's plot could have used just a touch of the mortician's brush to render it restful and at peace.",1258848000,,2453,4.764705882352941

2462879,5,B000CEXEWU,"Based on the favorable reviews, I watched this via streaming through my computer.  Even with streaming, the level of clarity and detail was amazing.  The story was very entertaining, and definitely an adult movie.  Adult only because I don't think a child could appreciate what we have here.  This was a love story.

2462893,4,B000CEXEWU,"The Corpse Bride, representing Burton's second major stop motion work, is an interesting fairy tale that can capture the innocent. Victor's coming of age tale is a well fleshed out fairy-story full of twists and turns and slight social commentary. The differences between the cold and dour land of the living and 'lively' colorful land of the dead provide excellent juxtoposition and a lesson about relaxing and letting loose.
The story itself is a tad on the shallow side, but we are looking at what is essentially a modern-born fairytale taking place in a nebulous ""victorian"" england. Victory is perhaps the only character to really see any actual development, but the story is his not the Bride's.
The animation quality is stunning, matched only by the more recent Coraline in it's field. Expect a visual improvement over the older Nightmare Before Christmas which has begun to show it's age.
Danny Elfman comes through again musically, even going so far as to provide his own voice to the cast for more than one number.

I recommend this film if you enjoyed Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline, or the works of Neil Gaiman. If you are a fan of Tim Burton's personal visual stylings then you will not be disappointed.",1252886400,,1222,4.903381642512077

The dead people are fun and energetic; the ""live"" people are as boring as mud (as depicted). There are totally believable (voiced) performances from good guys Depp, Bonham Carter & Watson, and the great Michael Gough. What made this different, and special from Burton's other animated films, is Danny Elfman's wonderful score, and especially the tribute to Gilbert & Sullivan. So clever, so intelligent. So unusual...it was the dead singing of their happiness. Let's just hope that little kids don't think it's ""cool"" to be dead. It's really a wonderful and sweet story, and, if kids listen, it's better to be alive. Making fun of the English, it's a tough call to say if ""Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" deserved that award.

2462922,5,B000CEXEWU,"I got to go to an advance screening of 'Corpse Bride'. The anticipation for the movie was high as the theater audience was clapping and yelling.

I had been afraid this was going to be too reminiscent of 'Nightmare Before Christmas', but it was delightfully original. That is potentially what I enjoyed most about the movie. It's quite an original story.

I commend Burton and all those who worked on this movie. I really enjoy watching the animation, and the characters are all very well developed. It's so good in fact, that I can't imagine this movie being done with real actors.

The songs in this movie are good and enjoyable. I don't enjoy them as much as I did 'Nightmare's', but they do justice.

The voice work in this movie is great. Depp(whose praise I'm not sure will ever stop) did excellent work. I don't think I would've known it was him, that is if I hadn't already. Albert Finney is great, and it's so nice to hear Michael Gough.

My only criticism of this movie is they don't always take enough time. It starts off wonderfully with the wedding rehearsal, introducing us to the characters and the situation. Then Victor takes ends up ""running into"" the corpse bride, goes to the ""underworld"", and the whole thing is explained with a song. I was left wanting more when it came to the corpse bride and the underworld. Then the movie continues at a nice level, just that one part left me wanting more.

It's a good movie. If you want to see it you shan't be disappointed. If you don't want to see it, it might be a pleasant surprise.",1244419200,,1547,4.487544483985765

The animation is unique and well done as Tim Burton does a superb job of creating the bleak upstairs world of the living and the colorful much more jolly downstairs of the well - not living.  The storyline actually has some important universal themes which is not surprising when you consider that this is based on an old folk tale.  The movie is often darkly funny and the Danny Elfman music is perfect as always.  While this is probably not appropriate for most kids under ten or so it is great choice for the tween age crowd.

2462947,5,B000CEXEWU,"Well people, there are plenty of reviews here to let you know what this is all about; the story, the feel, the emotion, etc., etc.  However, most only make a passing remark concerning the ""Claymation"".  Though I have not read all of the reviews here, I have not found one that really makes it clear what an artistic achievement this film really is.  ""Oh it's a kid's film that's too scary for kids""; is a fairly common criticism.  Complaints of its brevity have come from lovers and haters alike.  Some criticize the music's lack of ""hook"".  But I have not read the review that exclaims what brilliant art this really is (I apologize to those reviews I may have missed).  So, I'm adding one here to ensure that it is not beyond reach so late in the game (300 reviews can be daunting).  Let's get on with it...

-TECHNICAL ACHEIVMENT
Many people have made mention of the ""making of"" featurettes on this DVD.  They may have told you what they saw but never explained its significance (or really understood it).  In simple terms, this is digital animation.  With off-the-shelf software, a good digital camera (still camera) and a decent posable doll, you could do the same thing in your basement.  However, what was done hear technically rivals anything done before it.  Not even Ray Harryhausen, THE visual FX master that influenced generations of those in the art ever achieved anything of such explicit detail and subtlety.  We can marvel at the technical complexity and brilliance of the ""puppets"" but totally miss why they are complex; expressive motion.

-WHAT MAKES GREAT ANIMATION?
Some mistakenly assume that if the animation is smooth and fluid, then it is good animation; particularly when it comes to stop motion animation.  Well, that's partially true.  Making something move smoothly certainly helps convince us that it has life.  Yet, organic life isn't always smooth or regular; we bounce and stumble and jerk and shake.  We have weight and we create momentum and everything else physics brings to bear.  The animators in Corpse Bride understood this as much as any Disney animator ever did.  I think Ray H. understood this too but never had the technology and backing to ever get this level of detail with Stop Motion Animation.  Stop Motion fans adore and appreciate What Ray Harryhausen accomplished, but surely should recognize what's been achieved here.  These characters bounce and wiggle and exhibit weight and emotion.  Facial ticks and expressiveness only dreamed of in the past are taken for granted in this film simply because it is completely unobtrusive and natural.  Yet, we may never see this level of art in stop motion ever again.

-IS SIMPLE BAD?
I think a film that can turn the concept of a man accidentally marrying a corps into a 75 minute story is commendable.  This film never seams too short for me.  Some stories are as long as they need to be.  There is nothing complex about this film other than the emotions of the characters.  It's all too clear; the mundane existence of the everyday life is drowned in a sepia grey tints and superficial existence.  The enlightened existence of the pain free underworld is lavished in color, friendship and merriment.  Despite and because of this, true love will blossom; nothing wrong with that.  Simple can be bad if you don't like the concept to begin with.  I like dark stories that teach us something about ourselves and this does that in spades.

-""EMOTIONLESS, SHALLOW CHARACTERS.""????
Sorry, I read that somewhere here at amazon.com.  Well, I obviously could not disagree more.  To be fair you can't watch this film once and know all the characters; it's not that easy.  Some of the characters are emotionless and shallow by design, so I have to give a sideways nod to that statement, but I don't think the criticisms were aimed at those characters.  The first time I saw this at the theater I was very conflicted.  I criticized many of the same things others did.  I didn't get the characters.  It had a strange mood to it.  The music was completely unexpected.  But a good film proves itself in repeat viewings. After a couple of viewings, I felt that I knew all the characters personally.  I thought all the voice actors proved perfect.  I actually enjoy the songs now.  Perhaps this film isn't as simple as people say?

-MY RECOMMENDATION
  This is a fairly simple concept which is complex in its subtlties and may not satisfy everyone.  The music takes getting used to but can grow on you.  If you don't like dark fables told in animated films you should avoid this.  If you don't give a care for animation one way or the other then you probably won't think much of this.  If you are a fan of Stop Motion Animation then you really need to see this; if for no other reason than to appreciate the artistic and technical achievement, it will have been worth it.  The DVD has ample extras and a beautiful picture.  This film is one that grows in depth and enjoyment every time I watch it. As a fan of Stop Motion Animation I now revel in it.",1218153600,,5028,4.695303550973654
2462948,4,B000CEXEWU,"It's odd that Tim Burton's Corpse Bride should be released the same year as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wallace-Gromit-The-Curse-of-the-Were-Rabbit/dp/B000CZ0PT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</a>. Perhaps it was just an unfortunate coincidence that the two films, both are stop-motion animation, came out during the same time. Both films are great and award-worthy (W&G won the ""Best Animated Feature"" Oscar). Too bad this film wasn't held back until 2006 when it almost would've been guaranteed the award.

Johnny Depp voices the prim and proper Victor who is to be married to Victoria (voiced by Emily Watson). Their scheming parents who hope to exploit each other's fortunes, both of which are already spent, arrange the marriage. But on the day of the wedding Victor loses the wedding ring. He finds it in a dark foreboding forest... on the finger of a corpse. Now he must marry the Corpse Bride who is voiced by Helena Bonham Carter. Meanwhile Victoria is being courted by the wealthy (or is he?) yet morally bankrupt Lord Barkis. Soon Victor and the Corpse Bride go to the Land of the Dead to find out how to end their engagement but things become even more complicated when she develops feelings for him. All of this leads to a climactic confrontation between the living and the deceased.

2462971,2,B000CEXEWU,"I am one of many of Tim Burton's fans but i didn't find this movie particularly any good at all.

I felt as though the whole movie for one was too dark and even a little bit depressing, watching the smoothness of the animation was a joy but the rest of it didn't seem to have the same effect as the Nightmare Before Christmas seemed to have on me.

There wasn't much depth to the story and all the characters weren't inspiring at all and the whole movie itself seemed to drag because of it's lack in imagination considering that it only went for 74 minutes.

No characters that you could remember as much as Jack Skellington or for that matter any of the other characters as well, it just seemed a little rushed to me with no introduction to the characters at all giving none of them the appeal they deserved, seemed to me as a movie just made for the hell of it because of The Nightmare Before Christmas was a little bit ahead of it's time when it first launched in the early 90's (1993 to be exact), seeing that it was re-launched in cinemas once more it seemed that Tim Burton decided to take advantage of this with making another Claymation because of that reason.

I am very open minded and will not judge a movie by comparing it with another but at the same time with a movie like this made by the same person i found no other way to judge this movie because if i had i wouldn't be able to give it two stars at all more like one, just, but i didn't give it higher then a two out of five because i also think that children would also get bored by this story also, but i do give it an extra star for it's humor and it's music wasn't all bad either.

I personally think that it would make a wonderful stage show because it reminds me somewhat of The Phantom Of The Opera but besides from that i have to give it the a thumbs down.",1209168000,,1832,4.120448179271708

2462977,3,B000CEXEWU,"First of all, what threw me off about this film that it was somewhat a musical or rather, an operetta.  If I had known about that beforehand, I would have been prepared.  How?  Good question.  For some reason, in the beginning, I thought I was gonna watch an animated version of *Evita*.  I loved *Evita*.  I'm just not sure if I'd like an animated (the stop-motion kind) version of a musical.

Secondly, I thought this animated film was slow-paced along with a couple of  dry (boring) scenes.

In the Victorian era, a marriage has been arranged between Victor and Victoria.  (I couldn't help but think of Julie Andrews in *Victor/Victoria*.)  When they meet for the first time, they realized that their parents may have not made such a bad decision.  However, when it comes to wedding rehearsal, Victor just could not say his traditional vows properly.

Done for the day but with a scolding from the bishop, Victor heads out to the forest for some solitude.  In the midst, he practices his vows.  Using  some twigs as a prop to practice his vows and the placement of the ring, he finally gets it right.  However, the twigs turned out to be the fingers of the corpse bride, Emily.

Dreadfully, Victor learns that, even though he was practicing, his vows makes him officially married to Emily.  So, throughout the film, Victor does everything he can to get out of this marriage and back to Victoria.

The problem is that his (real-life) wedding is the next day and Emily will not let him go.  You'll have to watch the rest to see what happens.

Cute but bizarre movie.  Bizarre because of the operetta and not just the overall gothic, deathly appearance.  Again, slow-paced.",1204156800,,1673,4.670103092783505

2462992,5,B000CEXEWU,"From the creator of The Nightmare Before Christmas, the marianettes return to grace the stage and enchant the mind in this veritable aesthetic sequel to the Halloweentown masterpiece.

Set in repressive Victorian England, Victor Van Dort {who seems like a grown-up Vincent}, is a groom-to-be who stumbles out upon the grave of the morbidly lovely Emily, a dead bride who whole-heartedly accepts his vows while practicing in the woods. At the insistence of their families, he was betrothed to ""Victoria"" {read Ed Wood's 'Victor/Victoria'}, yet their oppressive natures sets him to seek solace in the nearby wilderness where he rehearses for the ceremony.

By the by, he feels himself growing fond of this corpse bride who takes him down to meet the denizens of her world, where he becomes acquainted with all sorts of interesting characters therein, consisting of a collection of free-spirited rogues, including a dancing skeleton named ""Mr. Bonejangles"" {Elfman; an obvious take on Sammy Davis Jr. complete with an eyeball which moves independently from one socket to another}, Paul the head waiter {a literal head with a French accent who goes about on spindles protruding from the neck}, a worm-like maggot with the certain features and personality modeled after Peter Lorre, a rather cute black widow spider, and a dog named Scraps who could very well be the skeleton of Zero.

Barkis Bittem is a black widower and a generally right rotten bastard who acquires his wealth on the deaths of previous wives, including Emily. With the mystical help of Elder Gutknecht, Victor, Emily along with her dead friends, walk the earth with the living to gather in a church for their marriage, despite the protests of Pastor Galswels {Lee}, where Barkis makes an appearance, who meets a proper demise. A surprising turn of events ensues with a beautifully bittersweet ending.

The worlds of the erstwhile dead and the living are juxtaposed between the colorful underworld, and the dismal mortal world above, where 'the dead' seem liberated from perfidious constraints. The visuals are superb in that splendidly gothic ambiance with a glorious soundtrack to match. No CGI, just the wonderful implementation of this past orthodoxy, preserving this magnificent theatrical art.

2463011,5,B000CEXEWU,"This movie is in my top 10 list and Blu-ray version is just jaw-dropping amazing.  I thought the DVD was one of the best looking animation, but after seeing this version there are much to critique.  The depth in the BR version is what you notice first, it was like watching a new movie.  The clothing textures, fabrics are now more noticeable, as well the character's clay model line and hole.  The items in the background also looked much sharper.  The lighting was a little soft or bleeds a little in the DVD version, but looks much sharper contrast in the BR.

Warner overall did a great job.  I read the still frame were taken in 3000dpi or was it 5000dpi, so there is more room for improvement.  I did not notice much different with the sound and the extra features were the same as in the DVD version.  Warner also did superd good with Happy Feet.

Previous DVD version review:
This was one of that movie that was a sleeper at the box office but was a great rental and even worth buying. I found this movie well done on many levels. First the clay animation facial movement was very believable. The musicals were not over the top and magical. The soundtracks bleed gothic love. The story while quiet short and predictable but was smooth and perfect.

I am not sure why other thought the ""Nightmare before Christmas"" was better. I found that movie way over acted and stereo-typing, while this one was quiet believable even if the plot is a dead bride. The concept would still work well with other situations replacing the dead bride. Yes the acting and the scenes are cold, but it is gothic.

Why this movie got five stars, it was one of the few movies that are quite saddening.",1191715200,,1683,4.4640522875816995

2463013,4,B000CEXEWU,"This stick-figure animated film offers good visuals, inventive-looking characters (that being perhaps the most fun of the film), and a decent story that finished with a very nice ending. There are songs in here but they are only so-so, and certainly not the attraction to the film.

The story starts off slowly, but once the characters went down under into the land of the dead, not only did we finally start seeing some colors other than blue, but the whole film came alive and pretty much stayed that way until the end.

As with good animated movies, there is so much you can see that you can't take it all in. It's a feast for the eyes with all the wild-looking characters and nice drawings. Getting good visuals from director Tim Burton is no surprise; he always comes through in that department. Unfortunately, he also usually delivers an anti-religious cheap shot or two.. Here, the minister is pictured as a sour old guy. Burton also pictures clerics in a negative way, and the occult in a positive way. However, he certainly makes interesting films, no matter what the subject matter, and there usually isn't a lot of profanity in his films. There is none here whatsoever.

2463017,5,B000CEXEWU,"I have to say I love Corpse Bride. It is the best Tim Burton film I've seen made in at least five years. It's not as good as Nightmare before Christmas but it's better than his later moves after Sleepy Hollow.

The animation is beautiful and the jokes are cute and random and though many were 'borrowed' from The Beetlejuice animated series I feel this is okay because that cartoon aired sixteen-years-ago and was made by Tim Burton, whom made this film.

The score was not Danny Elfman's best. It does not compare to Nightmare before Christmas or Edward Scissorhands but it is still beautiful, nevertheless. The songs aren't as good, by far, as Nightmare before Christmas but Remains of the day is very catchy. The character Emily (the corpse Bride) has a beautiful voice, too bad she only sings two verses in the song Tears to Shed.

The film is charming and has some heart warming moments. It treats death as nothing you should be afraid of. It's more of a celebration of life like the Mexican day of the dead. A child could watch this film without being too scared, they may take it like a faery tale.

I think this is the best film I've seen made in a long time. It was very refreshing and heart warming.

One thing that bothered me was that someone had told me that it's only implied that a certain character was Emily's killer. It was obvious to me that this person was her killer. And he practically told us directly that he was going to kill Victoria too. I enjoyed what became of Emily's killer though I will not spoil it, nor will I reveal who he is.

The characters of Victoria's parents are frustrating and offensive. Her mother refused to let the poor girl learn how to play the piano because it was 'improper' and 'too passionate'. Hopefully Victor will teach her. Also when she told her family that Victor was dragged off by a dead woman no one believed her and she was even locked in her room with the windows boarded up.

The characters of Victor and Emily are adorable. The ending is sweet and comforting. The dead are unintimidating (except to those who deserve it) and are quite friendly.

The opening scene ties in perfectly with the ending if you know how it ends.

References to earlier Tim Burton works:

Victor is mistakenly called Vincent once by Victoria's father. Vincent was Tim Burton's character from a stop motion film he did for Disney years ago and later appeared as Prince Vince on the animated Beetlejuice series.

The cat (Percy) that appeared in Vincent, Beetlejuice the animated series and Nightmare before Christmas also appears in this film but I only saw him for a moment and he looked to be missing his fur or now orange.

The skeletons had a xylophone band as Jack Skllington's children were to have according to the Nightmare before Christmas soundtrack.

Johnny Depp was a voice and he has starred in five Tim Burton movies.

The man who voiced the Nepoleon skeleton was the Oompa Loompa in Charlie and the chocolate factory.

Danny Elfman (whom has done the scores for every Tim Burton movie except Ed Wood) was the voice of Bonejangles, a singing skeleton. He was also the singing voice of Jack Skellington in Nightmare before Christmas, along with other characters.

Nepoleon Bonesapart also appeared in the episode Summer Vaction of the Beetlejuice animated series.

Like Sally the rag doll of Nightmare before Christmas Emily goes to pieces and sometimes the pieces remain active.

My favourite remembered jokes in the film:

Victor: 'Get back! I have a... dwarf. And I'm not afraid to use him!'

Maggot: 'If I wasn't just sitting in it I'd say you've lost your mind.'

Widow: 'You died fifteen-years-ago!' Skeleton lover: 'Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.' (Takes her in his arms and makes out with her)",1186704000,,3762,4.652567975830816

2463041,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton has become reknowned for his movies about the weird and the macabre. Sometimes weird, FUNNY and macabre.

And ""Corpse Bride"" has all three qualities, mixing in the bizarre and wacky with a bittersweet love story. It also has the sort of goofy ickiness that really expert haunted houses have -- you're enjoying the ghouls and skeletons too much to care who it's aimed at. This is an ""underground"" film in the best sense of the word.

Victor (Johnny Depp) is at the rehearsal for his arranged wedding, when he forgets his vows. Not a good omen. He runs out and rehearses it by himself, and ends up slipping the ring on the finger of a dead girl, Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). But Emily, who died tragically, falls in love with Victor and considers herself married to him.

Now Victor is trapped in the underworld, which is a surprisingly cheery, upbeat place when you consider everyone is dead. He tries to find his way back to the world of the living, but soon finds himself more drawn to the tragic Emily. Now he must make the ultimate choice: Will he return (for as long as he lives) to his arranged bride, or stay in the underworld with the Corpse Bride?

You'd think a movie about dead people would be depressing. At the very least, dark. But surprisingly ""Corpse Bride"" is neither -- instead, Burton has crafted a sweet, enchanting little love story where one of the people happens to be dead, and which is set in the underworld. There's nothing frightening about it. If anything, it's enchanting.

Is the plot original? Heck no -- boil it down, and you have a boy-meets-girl-while-engaged-to-another-girl story. But it's the delivery that's charming, from the funny dialogue (""Play dead!"") to the colorful inhabitants of the underworld (like the pirate, or the intimidating minister). The macabre humour and song-and-dance numbers add to the charm of this world, where the dead are more alive than the living.

And the voice actors seal the deal; what could have been merely funny becomes touching, in their hands. Johnny Depp brings the timid, tremulous Victor to life, and makes his dilemma believable, while Carter makes us look past protruding bones and bluish skin, to the sweet romantic Emily was. The only problem is that moronic maggot -- it's an annoying distraction.

It's not quite on the level of cult classic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" but ""Corpse Bride"" is still a hilarious, bittersweet little story with a macabre twist. Delightful.",1185062400,,2471,4.855106888361045

2463060,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride (2005) is a stop-motion-animated Romance as well as Comedy / Family / Fantasy / Musical which takes place in two parallel worlds, in the world of living and in the world of dead. It starts in the Victorian England and tells of a young man, Victor who is to marry a girl he never met, named Victoria (Victor and Victoria in the Victorian England). Victor and Victoria fell in love from the first sight but unknown for him, Victor finds himself married to Emily, a mysterious Corpse bride, and taken to the world of dead which in Burton's movie is much more colorful, friendlier, and jollier than the world of living...

With the running time only 76 minutes, ""Corpse Bride"" simply does not have time to become boring. It is funny, charming, and refreshingly effective in its use of the stop-motion animation in the age of the advanced computer technology. Some characters are absolutely hilarious, for example, a cute green maggot that lives in Emily's skull and pops out from her eye with the smart remarks and comments. The songs are nice; especially the one that tells the horrific story of the Corpse Bride in such colorful way that you would not stop smiling. Danny Elfman, the film's composer provided voice for Bonejangles, the singer.

2463087,5,B000CEXEWU,"A day after viewing this movie, I kept hearing this tune running around in my head.  It was Victor's Theme from this movie. The story is about a reluctant groom practising his vows for his arrainged wedding who accidentally marries a corpse bride. It gets interesting from there, but you should really see the film. It is done as a Musical-Comedy.

The picture on Blu-Ray is excellent. A good movie to test 1080P TV's. The first time I watched it, I couldn't decide if it was done with stop-motion photography or by Computer-Generated Immagery. The motion is so fluid and the effects (I.E. Bride's veil blowing in the wind) so well done that it's hard to believe it was done by stop-motion, or was it? See the special features for the answer. Every time I watch it I find something new. They did some very good optical effects that are normally done in a stage production.

The music is built around Victor's Theme and is delightful. My only complaint is that in a couple of scenes the music briefly overpowers the dialogue. You may hear parts of it in your head after the movie is over.

Trivia: 1. Find the tribute to the innovator of stop-motion photography.

2. Find Rhet Butler's Tagline. There are others if you just look for them.

2463099,5,B000CEXEWU,"This animated film that uses puppets and other means to build a full show, dancing, singing and haunting included, is remarkable. Remarkable for its pleasantly morbid humor and subject. Remarkable for its caustically social criticism. Remarkable for its mesmerizing loving young characters. These are the victims of everything in the world. Of their parents, of their social position, of their young age, of their romanticism, of their naivet&eacute; and of course of all the social climbers and social vultures our beautiful human society hosts and even cherishes. It is true without these social escalating climbers life would be humdrum and tasteless. With them it tastes like mud and there is always some hullabaloo around them.

The plot is superbly simple. The son of a rich bourgeois family is planned by his parents to marry the daughter of a pauperized noble family who is planned by her parents to marry the son of a rich bourgeois family. They fall in love at first sight, and first touch of a piano keyboard, which is exceptional for an arranged marriage. And then difficulties pile up because a social vulture comes up and wants the girl since he is pauperized and badly informed. He thinks the noble family is rich and he wants to put his hands (and both of them of course) on the girl and her familys fortune.

Then, due to some local and perverse circumstances the poor young man ends up in a cemetery and he gets, by total accident, married to a dead girl, hence a corpse till death us parts. But this clause is difficult to implement. The rest is to be discovered by yourself and your doppelganger because we all have a doppelganger who would like to visit the other side of the mirror, the other side of reality, the dark side of the moon and even the invisible side of our psyche. I know a lot of people who would love to visit the underground underworld just for fun, provided they can come back. Though coming back is the most difficult part of the game, and please do not fall in love with anyone on that other side because then youll have to join them for ever as soon as death us unites.

But the most beautiful and fascinating part of this film is of course the animation. I will not be technical but the puppets are perfects especially the skeletons dressed or undressed, dancing or not, singing or howling, playing bone percussions or bone saxophone. They can fall down on the ground and scatter all their bones and then in an instant get back up and reassemble the jigsaw puzzle of their ribs, phalanges and knuckles. There is some kind of a magical trick in that. I must say that the dancing skeletons can be alluring and even exciting. But please no S, were not necessarily English, but were dead. Too bad because a bag of bones can be very surprising at times.

The music is of course great. This is a Tim Burton film, mind you, And the music is essential to make the bone hallucination dance and sing. But the music is also essential to lure the social escalating climber into drinking the poison that was not intended for him, and he will not end like the girl he killed, always a brides maid but never the bride, he will end always a bridegroom but never a married man. Poor chap!

Finally it is important to know that this film is not recommended for sensitive people who should also be sensible and avoid the morbid fear and lethal angst they may feel in that funeral of a wedding, in that deadly descent to Limbo from which there is no way back. Once an underworld resident, always an underworld resident. Ask Orpheus about it. You will recognize that fascination for death that is the hallmark of Mr. Tim Burton. It is why we like him, true enough, but it is also why we come back all the time to be flagellated with bones, corpses, rotting flesh and maggots. I must say that the spider seamstresses are quite a perverse, obnubilating but so sugary-sweet-honey-pie vision. We could accept to become macabre diabetic and an overdose of that graveyard paraphernalia would lead us to the bliss of a symbolical and orgasmic death directly there in our armchairs.

It's imaginative, as was ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", but goes beyond that movie with even better stop-action animation and a musical score that is richer and more moving. I loved ""Nightmare"", but Corpse Bride takes all the things I loved and made them better. The voices of all the actors ring true. The mood is gothic and yet comical. The score is rich and defines the movie perfectly. (The DVD allows you to watch the movie with only the music, and that's a real plus.)",1163289600,,619,4.636363636363637

It even took me two tries to get through it, beautiful though some of it was, as well as grandly atmospheric and visually-appealing, and I think the reason this tale of a living man and his undead would-be bride failed to take hold of me related to its characters, who just didn't seem as interesting as those in The Nightmare Before Christmas. I hope Tim Burton continues to make animated films, in fact I wish he made them more often than he has, but Corpse Bride simply isn't among my favorites.",1162944000,,754,4.471014492753623

Tim Burton has an amazing way of making something ugly on the outside, something we shudder in fear at first glance into something truly amazing and unrecognizably wonderful on the inside.  Also, he tends to add themes to the story.  Here, there's the concepts of marriage for love (not monetary gain), getting to know someone before you cast judgment on them, and again, the concept of inner beauty.

2463106,4,B000CEXEWU,"Shy Victor's parents arrange a marriage for him, thinking that he will never marry on his own.  His parents are newly rich, so they immediately want to pair him up with someone from old money.  They arrange the marriage to Victoria, a young woman who's just as quiet and retiring as Victor.  But somehow, in the space of a few minutes, true love ignites between the two.  As soon as it does, however, the fates conspire to keep them apart.  First Victor can't remember his vows.  Then the priest sends him away, saying that Victor doesn't want to marry.  Then, when Victor finally practices his vows (thinking he's by himself) and gets them right, he ends up married to a young dead woman who was murdered for her dowry years ago.

Tim Burton directed the film starring Johnny Depp.  The two have worked together before on several projects, including EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW, and other.  Both are known for working with the bizarre and stylized worlds/characters.

CORPSE BRIDE is a simple tale, actually, and that really shines through.  If Burton and the writers didn't take this from a fable or myth, I'd be surprised.  It's just too natural.  The stop-motion animation is beautiful, and the two worlds (of the living and of the dead) are well thought-out and visually striking.  Everything ties in neatly at the end.

I watched it on HD DVD and found the production to be outstanding.  The sound wasn't Lossless, but it was really good and did well on my surround sound system.

Tim Burton and Johnny Depp fans will want to pick up CORPSE BRIDE.  Anyone wanting something unusual that you won't see every day would be interested in picking this one up for rent for movie night.

2463128,4,B000CEXEWU,"Much like his ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" uses state-of-the-art, stop-motion animation to tell a cheerily morbid story - this one showcasing bodies in various stages of decomposition larking it up in a musical comedy underworld.  Think of it as a role-reversal version of the myth about the god Hades and his reluctant bride Persephone, kidnapped from the land of the living.

Victor is a painfully shy and awkward young man who is about to enter into an arranged marriage with an equally shy young woman, coincidentally named Victoria (even more ""coincidentally,"" the movie takes place in the Victorian Era).  However, on the eve of the wedding, Victor finds himself ""married"" to a dead woman whose frozen corpse he stumbles upon in a nearby forest.  Victor is immediately whisked away to the Land of the Dead, where skeletons sing and dance, and where maggots and black widow spiders offer words of advice for the benighted newlywed couple.  Much of the story involves Victor's desperate attempts to flee the scene and Victoria's concomitant efforts to bring him back to the land of the living.

The talented animators have had a bit of ironic fun with the visual palette, bathing the scenes set in the real world in a ghostly-blue pallor, while bringing the Land of the Dead to life with vibrant, splashy colors.  In both foreground and background, the animation has a clean, uncluttered look, with the exaggerated, severely angular features of the characters providing amusing commentary on their personalities.  The dialogue is clever, sharp and witty, and the musical numbers have a buoyancy and bounce to them that help keep the morbid subject matter palatable for all but the very youngest audience members.  The film is also blessed with fine voiceover work from the likes of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Emily Watson, Tracey Ullman, Albert Finney, and horror movie veteran Christopher Lee.

""Corpse Bride"" is a relaxing, unfrenetic treat for those on all points of the life/death continuum.",1159056000,,2036,5.123867069486405
2463129,3,B000CEXEWU,"If you've seen other Tim Burton movies then this one will not disappoint. It has the style the humor and the poignancy he's known for. One point -- I didn't expect, can't imagine how I didn't hear, well -- it's a musical. The first time they burst into song I sort of sat there blinking like a caution light.

Short blurb: Parent arrange wedding between poor but aristocratic girl and rich but trade boy. Surprise they like each other when they finally meet. Boy is clumsy at the rehersal. Evil wedding guest of brides parents is cutting in remarks. Boy runs away and practices in the cemetery and end up marrying a corpse. Corpse bride is a nice girl who was jilted by her finance and killed. Boy tries to get to his 'living' bride. Lots of stuff happens and you can guess the end.

The animation is wonderful and filled with lots of little things in the background that just make the movie a treat for the eyes -- of course Corpse Bride is noir but that doesn't mean it doesn't have it's sight gags (the 'head' waiter in the graveyard bar). Dark and creepy with an inner beauty and strong core of love and redemption.",1157587200,,1119,4.400966183574879

The skeleton characters do not seem to faze her. There is only one true villain in the film, the gold-digging cad who murdered Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). He is evil but not scary.

2463132,4,B000CEXEWU,"As a child, one of the many reasons I loved Christmas was the many stop-motion animated specials that were shown at the time. But with the advent of CGI and other special effects of the like, the stop-motion art has nearly died. But luckily the genre has a savior in director Tim Burton who created A Nightmare before Christmas back in 1993. Over a decade later he Burton put out his second full length stop-motion animation feature film The Corpse Bride.

And since this is Tim Burton, the story is macabre and somehow sweet at the same time. The story takes place in Victorian times focusing on the arranged marriage of Victor, Johnny Depp in his sheepish Edward Scissorhands mode, and Victoria, voiced by Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love), yet somehow a joke was never made at this similarity. Unlike many arranged marriages, the two are smitten wit each other but this makes Victor a little too nervous as he messes up rehearsal. So he heads off to the woods to practice his vows only to unknowingly put the wedding ring on the finger of the undead who becomes, naturally, his corpse bride, as voiced by Helena Bonham Carter (Planet of the Apes, the Marky Mark version) and hilarity ensues. To all the dues that had to explain the stripper at your bachelor party, try explaining to you fiance how you ended up married to the undead the night before your wedding.

The puppets themselves were brilliantly crafted and very similar to those seen in Nightmare with a lot of very tall, very skinny or very short and very obese characters. Each and every puppet that shows up on screen is so entertaining and detailed in their own way they each could have warranted their own movie. The motions of the puppets are very slick and are not at all choppy like the old Christmas specials. There are plenty of plot twists to keep you guessing who Victor end up with and even if you are like me and are able to guess the big twist early, it still doesn't take away from the story.

The only problem with the movie is the stop-motion animation does get a little old as the film progresses. Maybe the Christmas specials had the right time frame with a half an hour runtime. But that is totally made up for in the DVD extras as there are seven mini-documentaries that run about five to ten minutes that show the behind the scenes on how the movie got made. Those alone make the DVD alone worth watching.",1154217600,,2389,4.538283062645012
2463133,5,B000CEXEWU,"""Corpse Bride"" is one of my favorite films from last year as well as being one of my favorite Tim Burton films. Tim's approach to animation in this film is absolutely amazing. If anyone can make stop and go animation look appealing, it is Tim Burton. When I first saw this film in the theatre, I have to admit I was rather surprised by the whimsicalness of the film. I was left with the impression that it was going to be a bit darker. Thankfully the whimsical feel of the film works, or at least for me it did.

Johnny Depp does the voice for Victor Van Dort, a shy young man who is about to marry Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) through an arrangement with both parents of the couple. After a botched attempt with his wedding vows at the rehearsal, Victor goes off into the woods to practice his vows. He unwittingly ends up proposing to a corpse bride name Emily (Helena Bonham Carter) and he ends up going to the land of the dead with his new bride.

Danny Elfman's score gives this delightful film that whimsical edge. I thought the color contrasts between the land of the dead and living was interesting and unique. I liked how in the land of the living, the colors consisted of dark hues while in the land, the colors were bright and vibrant.

The choices in actors to voice the characters in the film were as always a wonderful choice. Gotta love Tracey Ullman as Victor's mother Nell Van Dort and Joanna Lumley (of AbFab fame) as Maudeline Everglot.

The bonus features on the dvd were brief but nevertheless a delight to get a behind the scenes glimpse of the making of the film.",1154131200,,1590,4.416382252559727

Though life in the Land of the Dead proves to be a lot more colorful than his strict Victorian upbringing, Victor learns that there is nothing in this world, or the next, that can keep him away from his one true love.",1154044800,,508,4.521739130434782
2463135,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton, one of our greatest directors, has a stunning, occasionally unsettling, visual imagination. Beetle Juice gave us a good-humored descent into the underworld while Edward Scissorhands profiled a poignant monster far kinder than the nice suburban folk he encountered. Sleepy Hollow was dark, lush, and painterly. Mars Attacks! - bright and cheery - unleashed some of the nastiest cartoon characters ever drawn. Burton's celebrated stop-motion animation efforts; The Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach, and Corpse Bride showcase his uniquely graphic approach to film, to say nothing of his obsession with the macabre.

Maybe the problem is that Burton is starting to behave like a musician who only knows one song and wanders nocturnal landscapes in search of new ways to play it. Where The Nightmare Before Christmas seemed long on visuals and short on story, Corpse Bride feels positively content-less. This is the first movie I have ever seen where I thought to myself, ""You know, this would have made a much better book,"" something along the lines of Polar Express - huge format, gorgeous drawings, brief captions. Clocking in at an anemic 1:18, and padded out with some regrettable Danny Elfman musical numbers, Corpse Bride suffers from ""less there than meets the eye"" syndrome.

The humor here rests on a slender reed indeed; the living world is dark, foreboding, and cruel while the afterlife is a regular chuckle-fest. The film's most memorable scene is a piano duet between the living Victor and the dead, and cranky, Emily - necrophilia never sounded so good! Indeed, Emily, who has retained a splendid, even opulent, figure despite being dead, seems like a better choice than the living Victoria. Of course Emily does have that chatty and annoying maggot living behind her eye that, for some reason, sounds like Peter Lorre. Because it's a cartoon, voices are important, and Helena Bonham-Carter is perfect, as always. Johnny Depp, by contrast, is unfortunately cast and struggles through his English accent unconvincingly - are all English actors currently employed?

The story had characters that had a lot of emotion and you feel a lot of emotion for. A movie can have amazing animation and acting, but if the story isn't good, the movie fails and is a flop. Luckily, that is not the case here.

The musical scores of the film, while not up to parr with the memorable songs from ""Nightmare"", are still quite good. Would I say that this is as good as ""Nightmare Before Christmas""? No, but that is not in the least saying that this film is bad. This movie is excellent! It is extremely far away from being terrible, but ""Nightmare"" was just a ground breaking film that I didn't expect this would top.

For all the people that think this movie is not for little ones, I disagree.

I first rented the movie for myself (being a Burton fan) and my son (2 1/2) watched it with me. I didn't think he would love it (did think he would like it as he's turning out to be a Burton fan as well) but he adores it!

He sings along (as best he can) and adores everything in it. There is nothing wrong with the characters that are skeletons or have maggots or the such. Why would a little kid think that is scary? Have they seen things or heard stories of the like that has made them think they are bad? Why would I teach my son that death is scary? The movie shows that death is in fact not scary, that it's a part of life, and it's going to happen. And it focuses on love and promises and how to be a 'good' human thru Victor, Victoria and Emily.

2463152,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton returns to stop motion animation in ""The Corpse Bride"", a tale about the world of the deathly dull living and the lively dead, set in Vicorian era England.

Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp) is arranged to be married to Victoria (Emily Watson), so that his family may gain a title from hers and that Victoria's family may gain some money from Victor's, as they're broke. Being Victorian era England, corsets are tight, colours are drab and life is very strict. Everything for the upcoming wedding must be perfect. The local church pastor (Christopher Lee) has special vows for the couple to recite, and he, as well as their parents, are determined they get them exactly right. After humiliating himself at the marriage rehearsal, Victor wanders out of town into the dark forest to learn his vows properly. Role playing with the trees and twigs, Victor masters these vows, and confidently slides the ring onto what he believes to be a dead branch. But it is not a dead branch he has given his vows and ring to, it is a corpse of a bride named Emily (Helena Bonham-Carter), and she has taken his rehearsal very seriously indeed. As far as she is concerned, they are now married, and she whisks poor Victor away to the land of the dead, a world full of singing, dancing skeletons, spiders, green maggots, and blue faced corpses. Meanwhile, in the land of the living, a mysterious Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) has arrived on the scene, and wants Victoria to be HIS bride. Will Victor escape the world of the dead, and if he does, which bride will he marry?

For stop motion animation, the film is incredibly slick. Every movement flows, and there are no jerky movements, which is usually a characteristic of stop motion (of the earlier stuff anyway). The look and Danny Elfman's score for the piece are typically Burton. I found Elfman's songs a little easier to digest than his ones for ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", which was nice.

I was pleasantly surprised by the casting of the film. There's Joanna Lumley (from British sitcom ""Absolutely Fabulous"") who plays Victoria's mother. There's Michael Gough (Alfred from the Burton ""Batman"" movies, and the Celestial Toymaker from ""Doctor Who"") as the skeleton Elder Gutknecht. Deep Roy (from ""Big Fish"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") sneaks in too, as the Napoleon-esque skelton. But my favourite of the bunch is British character actor Paul Whitehouse (from ""The Fast Show"") who plays several roles: Victor's father, Mayhew and the ""Head"" Waiter. He's also in ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" as Sir Cadogan, if you want to keep an eye out. I really hope he does some more films, he's a very funny guy.

Special features include a selection of making of featurettes, which contain not only Tim Burton's words on the film, but some behind the scenes footage and the words of several of the actors and crew, as well as Danny Elfman, who did the music and songs. There's no interview with Paul Whitehouse though, which was a shame, but you do get to see him in the ""Voices Behind the Voice Featurette"", where you get to watch selected scenes of the film and the actors voicing them in the studio simultaneously on the screen. Its interesting to watch, because sometimes a single line of script is edited from several takes (particularly Johnny Depp's, I noticed), and the footage of the actor in the booth jumps about.

There's also an original theatre trailer, a production gallery (that is, a montage of stop motion tests for the characters, among other things), and a music only track for the film.

Recommended for lovers of Tim Burton and of animation. To ""The Corpse Bride"" you'll soon say ""I do... like this movie"".",1151539200,,3711,4.7725856697819315

It's a darkly gothic, yet beautiful love story about a young man, Victor who accidentally marries a corpse while practicing his wedding vows. His 'bride' Emily had been spurned by her lover in life, and is desperate to find love with her new groom, whilst the hapless Victor wants only to return to the land of the living and his beautiful fiance, Victoria. Meanwhile the sinister Lord Barkis Bittern is determined to step into Victor's shoes and marry Victoria himself.

Filmed in stop/motion (like Nightmare) the film has a surreal but captivating air. The living world is colourless and dark whilst the land of the dead is a vibrant, lively place, full of music and colour...a nice twist on the usual view.

Tim Burton has once again teamed with Johnny Depp (the voice of Victor) and his real life partner Helena Bonham Carter (the corpse bride). He also uses the voices of other well-known talents such as Joanna Lumley, Richard E. Grant, Tracey Ullman, Christopher Lee and Jane Horrocks to name but a few. Danny Elfman composed the music for the movie and with his usual flair has matched the mood of the film perfectly.

The DVD has been well produced and there are several featurettes including a music only track, interviews with Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, production galleries, and a look at the actors performing their voice-overs.

2463154,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton makes some of the richest and most detailed films today - perhaps his only competitor is Baz Luhrmann of ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo + Juliet"" fame.  Burton loves to dabble in the corners, creating mood and invariably a lot of humor with his deft touch.

Stop-motion animation serves as the ideal tool for the detail-oriented filmmaker -- this type of filmmaking takes tremendous patience, but it rewards the creative filmmaker with countless opportunities to find room for additional notes in a complex score.  Not for nothing are Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""James and the Giant Peach"" such popular DVDs -- adults and kids (over a certain age) can watch them numerous times and never get tired.

""The Corpse Bride"" allows Burton's gallows humor to run wild.  I'll spare you the plot details, which you can get in many of the other reviews.  I merely recommend that you look out for the little details that make the movie so rich, such as a reunited husband and wife blowing smokehearts instead of smokerings after they get reunited, or the clever use of different color schemes to separate the land of the living from the land of the dead . . . and not in the way you'd expect.

Burton once again works with Danny Elfman, whose musical tastes are as refined and twisted as Burton's sensibility.  Elfman's music fits the movie perfectly, but if I have a quibble with ""Corpse Bride,"" it's the same one that I had with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" -- some of the lyrics are so garbled that I can't understand them.  Maybe it's my shoddy TV, but there you go.  It's too bad, 'cause I could hear the majority of the lyrics, and they were fine.

2463177,5,B000CEXEWU,"""The Corpse Bride"" is a stop-motion masterpeice from Tim Burton and is set in the nineteenth century, in an apparently English town. Although what we see on-screen are the models, there is an all-star cast providing the voices. Johnny Depp plays Victor, the hero, while Helena Bonham-Carter provides the voice for Emily, the Corpse Bride. Others who lend their voices include Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Christopher Lee and Tracey Ullman.

Victor's wedding for Victoria Everglot has been arranged, with the film opening on the day of their wedding practice - an event that will see the bride and groom meeting for the first time. Victor's father, William, is a very successful and - as a result - very rich Fishmonger. Victoria's parents, on the other hand, are Lord and Lady Everglot. Although they aren't exactly happy about their daughter marrying 'new money', they no longer have their own 'old money' to match their status - hence the wedding. They would've preferred a more suitable son-in-law, but presumably nobody with a title was available.

Victor and Victoria have quite a bit in common though - they're both romantic, artistic souls - and they fall for each other the moment they meet. However, Victor is also quite newvous about the whole event and the practice is a disaster. Pastor Gaswels refuses to allow the wedding - set for the following day - to proceed until Victor learns what to do and say. Victor stumbles off into the woods to practice his lines : reciting his vows perfectly, he slips the ring onto what looks like a fallen branch. Unfortunately, it turns out to be the wedding finger of the Corpse Bride - and with the ovws now made, she doesn't want to give her new husband up.

Victor's Corpse Bride was called Emily when she was alive. Although Victoria is very pretty, it's clear that Emily was also on the other side of the grave. (In fact, at the risk of being considered somwehat odd, I would say she still is). However, while Victoria still has a beating heart, Emily has a maggot living in her head - who also appears to be her best friend. Her right eye also has the unfortunate habit of falling out and rolling around the floor. Victor, naturally, is initially desperate to return to Victoria. However, the Land of the Dead is much brighter and (would you believe) much livelier than the dull and drab Land of the Living. He also finds that his old dog, Scraps, is still <ahem> living there. There's also plenty of singing and dancing, much of it led by the very jazzy skeleton, Bonejangles. Upstairs, however, the situation is being complicated further by the devious Barksi Bittern. With Victor missing (presumed married), the smarmy, vain, money-grabber steps into Victor's shoes for the wedding.

I can only describe the film as flawless. It looks fantastic, it's very entertaining, the music is excellent, there's plenty of puns that will raise a chuckle, while Victor and both of his brides are genuinely likeable characters. Hugely recommended.",1148083200,,2995,4.84375

2463179,4,B000CEXEWU,"Corpse Bride (Tim Burton, 2005)

Tim Burton is a very, very twisted individual. And that is how we love him. Corpse Bride, his latest release, is a worthy, if minor, addition to his catalog.

Victor van Dort (Johnny Depp) is the son of a nouveau riche family, who plan to marry him to destitute nobility in order to increase their status in the world. While he's not terribly fond of the idea, that changes when he meets Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson), his prospective bride. His in-laws aren't much to write home about, but it doesn't matter; he's smitten. During the rehearsal, he is nervous, clumsy, consistently flubbing his lines and movements, and he flees into the forest to contemplate his cold feet. While practicing, he uses a convenient branch to practice slipping the ring onto Victoria's finger. The problem is, it's actually the skeletal and of the nameless titular character (Helena Bonham-Carter), who rises from the grave and claims that, since he said the vows, the two of them are now married. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Victor's prospective in-laws are fuming over his disappearance, while the mysterious wedding guest Lord Bittern (Gosford Park's Richard E. Grant) has his designs on marrying the lovely Victoria for himself.

Despite the above, this is actually a simple, straightforward film. The voice acting is quite nicely done, the songs are enjoyable, the pace moves right along. Remind you any of The Nightmare Before Christmas? It should. Burton isn't trying anything new here; he's taken a new story and stuck it into the proven structure. It's fun, it's enjoyable, it's good. Not great, but good. *** ",1147910400,,1638,5.011029411764706
2463180,5,B000CEXEWU,"Wouldn't it have been great to have been buddies with Tim Burton as a child?  He must have been the coolest cat around, a genius with an imaginatively poetic attraction to the darker side of things.  As a filmmaker, Burton's sort of an enigma to me.  Just look at Corpse Bride.  Apart from weird folks like myself, I don't see much of a target audience for this film.  Children may well find the start of the film a little tedious, since nothing big happens for a while, and both the story and music seem to play more for adults.  Sure, kids will find their fair share of laughs in the film and will surely enjoy the uniquely odd representations of Burton's characters, but issues of love, marriage, and death aren't exactly popular topics among the younger generation - and, truth be told, there's an element of sadness in the whole story, especially the ending.  Yet Corpse Bride is an animated film, and animated films aren't known, as a general rule, for packing in adult crowds at the movie theater.  Despite the absence of any obvious target audience, though, the film garnered many favorable reviews and more than paid for itself at the box office alone.  I don't think there's another filmmaker out there that could do what Tim Burton does and be so extraordinarily successful at it.

I'm not sure it will be the very first word, but ""unique"" should certainly appear somewhere on Burton's future tombstone.  While many a filmmaker never develops a style of his/her own, Burton is all but bursting with style.  I love the Gothic, decidedly odd-shaped inhabitants of this fictional world - and I find it very interesting that he imparts color and life only to the world below, juxtaposing this with the dreary, colorless greys of life among the living.  The wonders of stop-motion animation apparently know no bounds, and it's great to see a famous filmmaker not only continuing in the grand tradition but raising the bar for future efforts of a similar kind.

Boy meets girl.  Boy accidentally marries a corpse, etc.  Not your typical story, is it?  Poor shy, clumsy Victor (Johnny Depp); one day, he could probably count the number of women he's spoken to on one hand, then the next day, he's fallen in love with one girl - Victoria (Emily Watson), the girl his parents arranged for him to marry - and found himself betrothed to another, one who happens to be quite dead.  Really, though, I thought everyone knew better than to place a wedding ring on any inanimate object - that's just asking for trouble.  Victor does it while he's practicing his wedding vows, never realizing that he is speaking to and placing the ring on the finger of a corpse bride rather than a dead branch.  Poor Emily (Helena Bonham Carter), who was murdered right before her own wedding, has waited years for her true love to come and rescue her from her final resting place in the woods.  Suddenly finding her dream come true, she pops up and immediately absconds with her new ""husband"" to her own home in the lower world.  Naturally, Victor is more than anxious to leave the company of the lively but obviously very dead inhabitants of Emily's world and return to the world above - and to Victoria.  The viewer is necessarily torn by everything that happens from here on out.  On the one hand, there's sweet Victoria yearning for Victor to return and marry her; on the other hand, there's Emily, who loves Victor and truly deserves to be happy after her truly sad travails before death.  It's a harder choice than you might think, especially since Emily is - dare I say it - pretty hot for a corpse.

Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is, to me, a rather sad movie.  It will make you laugh, but it won't leave you laughing.  In any lovers' triangle, one of the three parties necessarily ends up the loser, and you will find no exception to this rule here.  The story plays out quite well indeed, but there's no getting away from the sense of melancholy inherent in the ending.  The only issue I have with this rather remarkably impressive film, though, is its running time.  Not counting the credits, you're looking at about 71 minutes - and it felt even shorter than that.  I would gladly have spent much more time in this literally jaw-dropping (watch for it), surreal, visually incredible world of Burton's imagination.",1147478400,,4301,4.655629139072848

Practicing his vows in a cemetery, he inadvertently places the wedding ring on the finger of the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter) and is whisked away to be her lawfully wedded (according to the laws of the afterlife) husband.

This is a visually arresting and touching tale from Tim Burton and Mike Johnson.  In their conception, the world of the living is rather dreary and gloomy while the afterlife is full of color, song, and dance.  The Bride herself is a figure of sympathy rather than horror, having lost her own chance for wedded bliss because of her murder on her wedding night.  Since then, all she has wanted is a true love with whom to spend her ""life.""  Victor is torn-he truly loves the woman to whom he is betrothed (Emily Watson) but also feels great sympathy and growing affection for the Bride.

2463182,4,B000CEXEWU,"Few directors- well, maybe none- mix dark Gothic images and whimsical asides like Tim Burton. ""Corpse Bride"", an Oscar nominee, is his second stop-motion animated film, over a decade after ""Nightmare Before Christmas"". This isn't as wacky and colorful as ""Nightmare"" but has many charms of its own.

  ""Corpse Bride"" has Anglo-Russian roots: staid Victorian

manners meet mysterious Slavic forests. It also has a triangle with supernatural overtones: a stick-figure boy named Victor (voice of Johnny Depp), his well-bred fiancee Victoria (Emily Watson) and the ghostly Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter)- an apparition who transports Victor to her underground world. All this is rendered in the stop-motion process; like ""Nightmare""- only more so- it's that Edward Gorey/Charles Addams look come to macabre, yet gentle, life.

  The voice work, with Depp and those distinguished Brits (including Albert Finney), is fine, with the ladies especially so; between this, ""Wallace and Gromit"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", Helena's got the franchise on twee but kid-friendly women. The look is distinctive, as you see the gloomy, sepia-toned town and musty mansions (maybe an Irish town but a Hungarian forest?) before Victor enters the devilishly colored underworld (a demented Oz?).

  What would any Tim Burton movie be without his musical muse, the very talented Danny Elfman? I continue to marvel at this man's witty, eclectic repertoire. The piano duet sequence with Victor and Victoria playing a moody, Chopin-esque

piece is moving, while the underground creatures warble wild Fats Waller-meets-Offenbach numbers. Of course, it's Danny on both keyboards and vocals, and you can see him do both in one of the featurettes. Others, none too long, cover Burton, his cast and the painstaking animation/puppet process; it requires hundreds of pieces and heads to make the main characters look alive.

  ""Corpse Bride"" takes the Gothic romance framework to an off-beat place. Short but sweet under that monster-movie cover, it's archetypal Burton and recommended for fans of his darker work, Elfman, or older kids (it may be a bit too creepy for under 8 or so).",1147046400,,2168,5.35693215339233

I LOVE Tim Burton flicks. I've seen each and every one of his films time and time again.  However, each and every time, I've been surprised with his movies. They have always been more than I expected. They entrance, they amaze and ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" is no exception.

Based on a European folk tale, ""Corpse Bride"" is the story of Victor.  Living in a small Victorian town in the 1800's, he is engaged to be married to a woman named Victoria whom he has never met. When he does meet Victoria, however, he realizes how much he DOES want to be married to her, that love at first sight does exist. There is only one problem: The Corpse Bride.

After fumbling with the vows during the wedding rehearsal, Victor runs to the forest and practices his vows until he gets them right; and places the ring on the outstretched hand of the Corpse Bride. She takes his practice vows for the real thing and takes Victor down to the Underworld. Emily loves Victor, the man who can love her even in death. But what will happen when Victor tries to get back to the woman he loves in the world of the living? Only death will tell....

I wasn't sure what I was expecting when I went to see ""Corpse Bride"" the first time. Now, I made a fatal mistake here: I went expecting the film to be like a non-musical version of one of my all time favorite Tim Burton flicks ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". How wrong I was. For, while the film WAS done in stop animation, ""Corpse Bride"" was NOTHING like it's predecessor. I judged the film by what I saw in the previews AND I formed preconceived expectations of what I would be seeing. That's a big Tim Burton No No.

I was astonished, therefore, within the first five minutes of the film to realize that it WAS in fact a musical. It didn't have nowhere near the number of songs and huge numbers that ""Nightmare"" had, but it WAS a musical. If there's anything I've learnt with Tim Burton films it's this: Don't go to the theatre with preconceived notions; they will be blown into smithereens. ""Corpse Bride"" shattered all of them for me. The film, while certainly not as lively as ""Nightmare"" was beautiful, haunting, gorgeous, lyrical, and heartbreaking.

At first, I was really put off by ""Corpse Bride"". It wasn't what I thought it was going to be, and I was a little pissed off. Even as I left the theatre, I was still ticked at the non-splashy ending. It was only after I thought about the film for a good week that I realized that there was nothing bad about it. ""Corpse Bride"" may have been told in stop motion animation, but it had a deeper message than ""Nightmare"".  It was a beautiful, lyrical film and it was only my own preconceived expectations that were getting in the way of the films enjoyment. I can't express in words how much this film moved me, after I got my expectations out of the way.

I went to see the film a second time, just to give it a fair shot. I am SO glad I did. I was blown away by how beautiful the movie was and left the theatre thinking of ""Corpse Bride"" again; this time in an excellent light. More profound than ""A Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Corpse Bride"" really IS art in motion.

 ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" continues to haunt me. I may even go see it for a third time. It's the perfect movie for Halloween and makes even death look beautiful. Go see this while it's still in theatres. You won't be sorry.

2463186,3,B000CEXEWU,"it at least makes for a contrast and variety in opinions, right? Right?

Anyway, I am a Tim Burton fan. I think he'd be the perfect director to bring some of the works of author Neil Gaiman to the silver screen, I remember being taken with the movie ""Beetlejuice"" back when I was very young, and I've made it a point to see pretty much all of his movies from the age when I realized he was the guy behind a lot of these cool movies I was seeing. The vast majority of them I enjoyed thoroughly, ""Mars Attacks"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" notwithstanding.

The problem is that I am not being 100% fair to this movie. If I had never seen ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" I would probably have enjoyed this movie more. But I have seen it, and it's difficult to *not* make the inevitable comparisons, and find ""Corpse Bride"" lacking.

I wanted to like this movie more. I didn't dislike it. But I found little that was truly compelling. It's a short movie to begin with, but it seemed shorter than it actually was - in most cases, that's a good thing, movies shouldn't seem like they drag, but in this case, it just seemed like enough didn't happen and it was over before there was a chance of a movie of any impact to happen.

Basically, my problem was I felt like I was watching a slightly-better-than-average version of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" that cut a lot more corners than the original. The designs of many of the ancillary characters look too much like many ""Nightmare"" characters (and the Corpse Bride doesn't look a whole lot different than Sally for that matter). Thus, they lack memorability partly because of that, partly because, unlike the ""Nightmare"" characters, very few characters in the movie are more fleshed out or given interesting twists. The trademark quirky charm of Burton and ""Nightmare"" seems old hat by now with no real new spin on it. Some of the secondary characters seem less interesting and more like two-dimensional stereotypical cut-outs than real characters.

The difference between Halloweentown and Christmastown was quite pronounced and a good contrast in ""Nightmare."" In ""Corpse Bride"" the difference between the old time ""real world"" and the world of the dead isn't so pronounced, and neither of the worlds is designed with the visual flair or creativity found in the older film.

The twist near the conclusion of the movie was pretty easy to see coming from fairly early, and it came off as somewhat contrived to give the ending the proper spin to go off on. The movie is technically great, but the story and designs seem thin and rushed, like not enough time was spent on them, which is odd since it was in the works for so long. Some of effects used in ""Nightmare,"" (among them, the neat lighting in Oogie Boogie's lair, which is similar to some of the lighting used at the beginning of ""Remains of the Day"") were not utilized as well in ""Corpse Bride.""

On a positive note, the music was great, as we've come to expect. The use of Wagner was great, and I particularly enjoyed ""Remains of the Day"" and ""Tears to Shed."" The music fit the varied moods of the movie excellently and was one of the high points of the film.

In conclusion, since many people don't seem to have the grievances I do with this film, I'd recommend it. I think people who see the previews and trailer should come into the movie with a pretty good idea of whether they'll like it or not, so people interested enough in the movie to be reading reviews of it will probably enjoy it. One suggestion, though: this movie's magic may work better on you if ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" isn't fresh in your mind.",1146182400,,3621,4.585780525502319
2463201,3,B000CEXEWU,"Despite my liking of Tim Burton and all of his movies (particularly ""Nightmare before Christmas"", ""Big Fish"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") I have to say that Corpse's Bride is no movie for kids at all.

The subject, the scenery, the environment, the theme, the supposedly funny situations are really really dark, obscure and ultimately scary for kids. Really scary. Of course grown ups perhaps won't agree but I see it this way from my experience with my two kids (7 and 6) as well as with some of their school friends. To the point in which my kids when remembered still say ""No mommy, that movie again, no mommy please""

Aside of that, and hadn't I brought my kids with me to the movie theater, I'd probably say the movie was excellently made visually, artistically as well as technically. I would also say that undoubtedly, Tim Burton went great lengths this time, particularly in terms of the animation techniques and the final product, delivering a movie that is as visually stunning as thematically schocking, and succeeding in creating this somewhat dark yet familiar ambiance that serves as a wonderful frame for the whole story to unfold. Though reminiscent of their real alter-egos (the everpresent Johnny Deep and Helena Bonham-Carter) the main characters come out convincing and real. As for the story, I would also say that it is undoubtedly compelling and dealing with undeniable facts of life (and certainly death). Summarizing, I would say that Tim Burton certainly did not let down his fans this time.

...That's what I would say hadn't I brought my kids with me to the movie theater... Perhaps I just have to get used to animated movies NOT intended for kids. And I will most certainly be sure to pre-check the movie rating next time I feel like taking my kids again to a Tim Burton movie.",1146096000,,1818,4.7834394904458595
2463202,4,B000CEXEWU,"Corpse Bride was great, just like I thought it would be. In fact, it was exactly as I expected it to be -- which is good and bad.

I like Tim Burton and I like Johnny Depp, but I'm getting a little tired of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, together forever, true love always, etc. This time we have a Johnny Depp puppet. He is great, don't get me wrong, and I deeply understand the fixation, but... enough already. Note to Johnny Depp: More Finding Neverlands. More Pirates. Fewer deranged chocolate magnates. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a magnificent disaster.

Corpse Bride is neither a disaster nor a mess. In fact, it is lovely and charming, in exactly the way you would expect it to be -- no more and no less. The soundtrack is spot on, the visuals are haunting and exquisite, and the storyline is sweet. It did not blow me into next week like Nightmare Before Christmas did. However, this time I felt like I was in familiar territory, and when I saw ""Nightmare"" for the first time, I'd never seen anything like that before. Maybe if I'd seen this one first, I would have felt the same about it.

As for the love triangle between Emily Watson, Helena Boneham Carter, and Johnny Depp, I was definitely rooting for the Corpse Bride to win. The ending was tidy. The whole movie, in fact, was a little tidy. After the ""Ahhhh cool!"" moment of seeing how the real world was faded and the afterworld was saturated with color, I didn't see anything else in the movie to really charm me, apart from the usual Burton visuals.

I think that with the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Burton just lifted the bar so high that even he has trouble climbing over it any more. The one thing that did completely enthrall me was the fact that this is stop-motion animation. At the beginning of the film, I said to my husband, ""It almost looks like stop-motion animation, but it couldn't possibly be. They must have used computers to kind of simulate it, for nostalgia purposes."" No, it is really the genuine article. Which is stunning and beautiful. If you watch the ""making of"" featurette on the DVD, your teeth will fall out of your head with admiration for the effort that goes into this stuff. It is truly amazing.",1145404800,,2200,4.4925

  1) Creativity- those puppets were awesome. They were perfected. And the storyline-Wow. It took 10 years because they wanted to do it the old fashioned way.

  2) Cast- the actors and actresses were REALLY good. They made the characters real and alive, so that you ended up feeling for them

  3) Music- I loved the music. The first song was so cool, I memorized it. And the song Victor plays on the piano is really good, too. The one that the Corpse Bride (Emily) sings about her heart breaking was good, but sad.

This movie is one of my favorites! Watch it today!",1145059200,,593,4.407407407407407
2463204,3,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's second film this year is another stop-motion feature like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", and in many ways, it's like an unofficial sequel. It has a spindly protagonist in a mysterious forest, a moon-faced heroine (two, in fact), a score peppered with Danny Elfman songs, a skewed take on a time-honored tradition, and a unique blend of the grotesque and the sweet.

The film gets off to a wobbly start as Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp) is introduced to his bride-to-be Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson). The Van Dorts have made their fortunes in fishmongering, and are eager the ascend the social ladder. The Everglots are destitute, and see the Van Dort fortune as the only way for the Everglot name to regain its lustre. All the in-laws sing as they gather for the reheasal, and their perspectives on the marriage are underscored in the song ""Nothing To Chance"". Unfortunately, it's not a particularly catchy tune, so it doesn't set the stage well.

Neither family is particularly interested in whether or not this couple of convenience love one another. Fortunately, Victor becomes fond of Victoria immediately after meeting her. However, he is so beset with the gravity of the situation that he can hardly keep his marriage vows straight. He is so discombobulated, in fact, that he is told to continue practicing until the wedding. This is where Victor's troubles -- and the film's pleasures -- truly begin.

Victor accidentally weds himself to Emily (Helena Bonham-Carter), the corpse of a bride who has resolved not to rest until someone asks to wed her once more. Initially terrifed by his zombie spouse (her introduction is delightfully creepy), he attempts to find a way to dissolve the union. Distraught that Victor is no longer eligible, the Everglots begin to consider other, more dubious marriage options for their daughter. Meanwhile, Victor begins to discover that Emily has charms of her own.

In most ways, ""Corpse Bride"" is superior to its predecessor. The animation and art direction take the ""Nightmare"" look and movement to new levels of sophisitication, especially in the acting. The stop-motion puppets, rather than replacing whole heads to create dialogue and facial expressions, have improved, uh, skulls with internal mechanisms that can be manipulated for greater subtlety. This, combined with more refinement in the pantomime work, leads to many beautiful scenes, including one where Victor and Emily play a duet on a piano. The animation goes a long way in making rotting, maggot-laden Emily attractive and a dead pet's peppy bounding cute.

The story is also much clearer and more streamlined than the song-laden ""Nightmare."" It's a sufficiently old-fashioned plot to make a fine, uh, skeleton for Nelson Lowry's English/Gothic art direction. The comings and goings between the lands of the living and the dead are unclear in their rules, but they don't impede the entertainment. It's a happy surprise to see that (unlike many films of this type) the choice between Emily and Victoria is not an easy one -- both characters are presented as appealing and sympathetic.

The main weaknesses of the film are the songs by Danny Elfman. While several in ""Nightmare"" are catchy and charming, the best numbers in ""Bride"" feel a bit like wordy castoffs from his earlier score. The orchestral work, though, is fine and does a great job of supporting the spooky humor of the film. While ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was enjoyable, ""Corpse Bride"" feels like a film much closer to Tim Burton's heart. And it shows.",1144886400,,3562,5.059625212947189
2463205,5,B000CEXEWU,"This movie is one of the sweestest tales of romance, death, following the path that one must choose themselves, arranged marriage, confusion, rotting corpses, seeing skeletons, dancing bones, and talking heads that I've ever seen. In fact, its the only one I've ever seen, But that is besides the point.
 Charmingly executed, this movie follows the planned marriage of two young (living) humans, Victor and Victoria. After runnign off from his own practice wedding ceremony, Victor practices his vows out in the creepily doused-in-moonligh- forrest. Here, after reciting his vows perfectly, and placing the ring on what he thought to be a dead twig, Victor finds himself married-to a corpse bride.
 The movie then procceeds to follow the marriage ceremony of one living and one not, and the crazy obstacles that must be accomplished. Sweet, charming little musical songs accompany the movie wonderfully. This is one of the greatest soundtracks for a movie I have heard in years.
 Then there are also the characters. You feel a special sort of ""bond"" to Emily, the corpse bride, willing to give anything for Victor and her to be happy together. Victor, the somewhat clumsy, but entirely devoted ""husband"" is one of the most likeable characters. You musn't then forget the evil chracters, like Lord Barkis (I hope I spelled that right..) as well as Victoria's parents, who want her wed solely for the purpose of ""keeping them out of the poor house"" as they put it.

It a charming, odd (but cute at the same time) and fun movie. It's not hysterically fun, but the way Burton uses irony to get the message across is thrilling. Burton also makes you guessing which one Victor will end up marrying in the end. This movie is good entertainment without being Oscar material.

don't get me wrong this movie is a decent movie.. I just had way too high of an expectation for it..

- Corpse Bride

Tim Burton is back with a brand new genre bending stop-motion bonanza. With the cult success of Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride is a long-awaited return to animation for the always interesting Tim Burton. This romance/musical/dark comedy/horror/fantasy film introduces Victor Van Dort, a shy and klutzy groom-to-be who has in affinity to being at the wrong place at the wrong time. After being thrown out of his own wedding rehearsal to properly learn his vows, he drifts into the woods, trying to get the lines right in his head. By accident, he places the wedding ring on a tree limb that is actually the fingers of the Corpse Bride's dead hand. Cue chaos, absurdity, and hilarity.

Just like the majority of Burton's films, this film centers around the lighter side of death and the afterlife. With brilliant visual effects and a delightful score written by the genius Danny Elfmann, Corpse Bride is part-Poe, part-Beethoven, part-Marx Brothers physical comedy. Compared to The Nightmare Before Christmas, Corpse Bride gives the stop-motion clay animation a new evenness and sheen that NBC did not have. Though, some of the charm that NBC had was because of its rough edges and ruggedness. Don't be weary of seeing the film though! It is packed full of the usual Burton eccentrics and oddities.

Filled with worrying brain maggots and assorted other necro fun, Corpse Bride is total eye candy. One thing about Tim Burton films that you can always rely on are the amazingly odd and unique visuals. There are also various odes to other movies through out the script of the film. Such as when two of the town people who were previously lovers are reacquainted, the woman says, "" Is that you? But, you've been dead 15 years!"", and the skeleton replies, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"". Which is a direct reference to the classic scene between Rhett and Scarlett in Gone With The Wind.

As a whole, Corpse Bride lacks some of the charm that made Nightmare such a fan favorite, but still delivers when it comes to stunning visual effects and entertaining and well directed musical numbers. Tim Burton continues to reinvent genres and to break through the barriers that many directors continue to be held back by. Corpse Bride leaves you in anticipation for Tim Burton's next escapade, but doesn't quite deliver the same filling feeling of his other films. In no way is Corpse Bride a bad film, it's actually a quite good film, but you will come to notice that every aspect of the film is missing a certain something that some of Burton's films had. Whatever that is only Burton could know, fore the normal mind would explode at the thought of such a perfection.

The plot is droll, almost like Burton read the cliff notes version of the fable.  The character development (what little of it there was) is painfully easy to predict, more like a fledgling directors work. The score was weak at best.  Elfman just didn't seem to put as much into this project as he has in others.  It seems to me that Burton and Elfman put in a whole weekend worth of thought into this work.

The story while quiet short and predictable but was smooth and perfect.

I am not sure why other thought the ""Nightmare before Christmas"" was better.  I found that movie way over acted and stereo-typing, while this one was quiet believable even if the plot is a dead bride.

The best bonus feature is a 13-minute production gallery that turns out to be, well, a Tim Burton movie. Rough sketches, animation tests and disembodied characters whiz by, accompanied by hip funereal music.

The DVD featurettes don't dig into the gory details -- none last more than 7 minutes. ""Lord of the Universe,"" a Tim Burton profile, celebrates his ""black and beautiful humor.""

Helena Bonham Carter appears here as well, as the bone-yard bride.

Danny Elfman gets a few minutes to talk up the music. ""In the land of the dead, it's pretty jazzy,"" he says, explaining the Cab Calloway-meets-Tom Waits number he performs. (Burton agrees: ""The world of the living is actually much more dead than the world of the dead."")

2463220,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is an excellent escape into fantasy for all ages.  Top flight voice talent and acting combined with a unique vison and atypical animation make this a standout.

As most probably know by now the story is about a dead bride who is unwittingly married by our other main character Victor.  The fact that no priest was in attendance to perform the cerimony doesn't bother Emily, our corpse, one bit and she happily wisks Victor away to the land of the dead.  By contrast with the strict and boring living world it is a colorful mis-mash of characters.  He first wants nothing but to leave and get back to Victoria, his intended bride who he'd happliy dicovered he could love even though their marriage had be pre-arranged.  He comes to discover though that you can't judge a book by its cover and that loyalty and love can bind people in unexpected ways.  I enjoyed this movie as well as my 5 and 2 year old daughters so I'd say it is all ages appropriate.  There are a couple of silly gross moments and jumpy scares but nothing too bad.

The stop motion animation is simply amazing.  The pupets created for the movie were marvels of pupet technology with heads full of gears that could be adjusted bit by tiny bit to alter the facial expressions of them.  And our main charateters, Victor and Emily surprised me time and again at just how expressive they were.  In one of my favorite scenes they play piano together and the devilishly mischievous look on the brides face is amazing.  You'd almost think this was CGI at first glance which makes it all the more amazing that this was done by hand, one picture at a time.

I beleive the most work was done on the corpse bride puppet as she emotes and expresses the best.  Also she is the most attractive character in the movie which is all the more amazing as she is dead and decomposing, and even missing some skin.  Crazy.

Victor stumbles through his wedding lines during rehearsal, and wanders off into the woods to practice.  Unfortunately, Victor finally gets the lines right and awakens the corpse bride, a girl who died on her wedding day and has been waiting for her husband to return.  The corpse bride, Emily, rises from the earth in front of Victor and accepts his vows.

Emily takes Victor ""downstairs"" to her world, the world of the dead, while his true love Victoria awaits him in the land of the living.  When Victor shows up in the living world only to confess he has married a corpse, the Everglot's arrange for Victoria to marry someone else, a pompous devil who believes the Everglot's have money, Barkis Bittern.

Will Victor be forced into honoring the vows he spoke to Emily, or will he be set free to marry the live and innocent Victoria before she falls victim to Barkis?

In my opinion, the problems with this film outweighed the attractions.  It seemed to straddle the fence between its appeal to a children's audience and an adult audience, making it flavorless in both arenas.  It's a little too gruesome, in spite of its ""cuteness"", for small children, yet the songs and the shallowness left it too insipid for adults.

The vocal talents gathered are among the best; Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Joanna Lumley (I LOVE Absolutely Fabulous, sweetie-darling), the remarkable Albert Finney, Tracy Ullman, and Christopher Lee, but without a decent script their talents were stifled.  The animation was fun, but stiff in places, such as where Emily's gown was supposed to float in the wind and wound out looking like a piece of cardboard.

2463236,5,B000CEXEWU,"This is the tale of Victor Van Dort
A nervous young man of a cynical sort
To Victoria Everglot he is to be wed
And there are doubts ringing inside of his head
Her parents are rich, his parents are poor
And the two haven't seen each other before
At the rehearsal Victor gets nervous and books
Maybe because of Mrs. Everglot's looks

He flees to the woods to practice his vows
Beneath tall, creepy trees and large, hooting owls
Upon placing a ring, just for practice's sake,
On what looks like a branch, the ground starts to shake
There emerges a rumble and an eerie bright flash
That sends Victor running through the woods in a dash
It was Victoria he was destined to wed
But his ring was placed on the Corpse Bride instead

The Corpse Bride loves Victor but he loves her not
And poor sweet Victoria is sad and distraught
Her fiancee is missing and her wedding day doomed
For Victor will not be coming back soon
Barkis Bittern she is then planned to wed
For the town believes Victor is probably dead
But Bittern's agenda is a sinister one:
He will marry Victoria, take her money, and run

Victor is troubled, and frightened of course,
But in the land of the dead, there is no divorce
Yet the Corpse Bride has passed and Victor's not dead
So if he were to die they can legally wed
The story is sad and emotionally blue
What in the world is Victor to do?
The Corpse Bride is saddened for love is at stake
Though her heart has no pulse, she can still feel it break

""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" is loaded with cheer
And is one of the liveliest films of the year
The stop-animation is great all the same
With lifelike movements done frame by frame
The beauty on screen is conveyed with two worlds
The land of the dead contains cheer and bright colors
The world of the living is heavy on gloom
With dark muddled colors conveying their doom

Tim Burton has mastered a visual style
That no moviegoer has seen in a while
The film is a wonder aside from it's plot
Of a young man's heart that is tied in a knot
It is a joyful romp of laughter and song
That at 75 minutes doesn't last very long
To fans of the genre I will tell you this
""Corpse Bride"" is a film you will not want to miss

2463237,4,B000CEXEWU,"I probably would have liked this movie more if I had not already seen - many times - ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" which was a brilliant and original piece of work. This movie does share some of that movie's qualities - haunting soundtrack, bumbling authority figures, a tall thin protagonist who is searching for something, a heroine whose limbs easily detach, and a dear departed housepet. It also has some interesting ideas of its own - the living looking and acting as though they were already dead, versus the dead living it up, since they have no more worries and forever to look forward to with the prospect of all of their loved ones returning to them one by one. In fact, the only time the living seem happy in this film is when the dead return to the land of the living for a truly unique wedding and instead of menacing or haunting the living, there are tearful and happy reunions. However, the individual characters in this film are just not as interesting as those in Burton's other animated film, ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". In short, even though all of the characters in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" are dead, they just seem more alive and motivated than the characters in this film. Also, this movie is darker than ""Nightmare"" and not as funny, so kids under 10 might find it too intense and probably not as interesting. Thus, although it is worthwhile viewing, I'm just afraid that Tim Burton set the bar too high with his previous animated film.",1141430400,,1476,4.680769230769231

2463239,3,B000CEXEWU,"I went into the theater with high expectations and left it dissapointed. I was hoping that it was gonig to be good as 'a nightmare before christmas' but it didn't even come close. The main character Victor and his fiancee Victoria are very boring, bland and forgetable so I didn't care for them much. Not much happens in the movie so it dragged throughout. The songs were also bland and they didn't really hold my attention. Everything is gray in the land of the living and everything is colorful in the land of the dead. I guess because life is boring and you have lots of fun when you're dead, either way I didn't like that. I did enjoy the animation and scenary and the movie did have some good parts to it but it didn't leave much of an inpression on me. I really do enjoy Tim Burton's movies and I like to watch them over and over again but after seein this movie I didn't feel like I needed to see it again because once was enough. So I would recommend that you first rent this movie and then decide if you want to own it or if watching it once was good enough for you like it was for me.",1141257600,,1094,4.140845070422535
2463240,5,B000CEXEWU,It is a touching story that follows in the tradition of Nightmare Before christmas. And that is saying something! I couldn't believe that Tim Burton would top himself! But he did. This movie has a voice all it's own and deserves to be seen.

2463241,5,B000CEXEWU,"It's true that Corpse Bride cannot be considered typical Saturday morning cartoon fare...and for that i say HALLELUJAH!

This movie deals with death in it's truest form without any effort to beautify or disguise the end result. There are skeletons, spiders, poisons, daggers everywhere...and the dead dance.

But above all of that this is a story of love and the sacrifice made for it...and we all know that true love never dies.

Close your eyes and open your hearts...",1141171200,,470,4.924050632911392
2463242,4,B000CEXEWU,"""Corpse Bride"" is an enjoyable film without even taking into consideration the huge amount of work that goes into claymation films.  When you do take that into account, the movie becomes an art form in and of itself.

The realm of the dead provides by far, the best of the characters.  The subtle comment on the world of the dead versus the world of the living is by far the best sentiment of the movie.  The world of the living is dull, gray and almost lifeless, while the world of the dead is seemingly fun-filled, care free and colorful.  After all, they are unencumbered by the need to get a foothold in the pettiness of social status.  And their music is better too.  The musical scene in the bar after Victor's arrival is comedic and enchanting at the same time.  Why Victor wanted to leave to go back to his drab, lifeless world is almost beyond comprehension, unless of course the whole concept of body parts falling off is bothersome.

Danny Elfman's score is superb as usual and flows flawlessly with the film.  The voice talents are also excellent and really make these characters come to life.  The plot of the story is a bit thin and the characters are not nearly as endearing as those found in Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", which was in a class all its own.  A bit more time should have been dedicated to the exploration of the characters.  It's a bit difficult to comprehend why Victor was in such a rush to get back to a girl he barely knew.  A few more scenes between these two characters would have greatly improved the overall feel and sense of the movie.

While I suppose it is not fair to compare these two films (other than the obvious claymation aspect), one can not help but notice the similarities and the differences between the two.  While ""Nightmare"" shines, ""Corpse Bride"" falls a little flat, but in story line alone.  The claymation is flawless and no one can dispute the talent involved in the creation of a film of this nature.  Tim Burton seems has proven himself a steadfast fan of this type of medium and I can't think of anyone that could do it better.",1140912000,,2098,4.505291005291006
2463243,4,B000CEXEWU,"Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp) is the son of wealthy fishmongers and he's had an arranged marriage set up for him. His wife to be, Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson) is the daughter of Victorian-style royalty who are having financial difficulties. Marrying Victoria off is seen solely as a ""plan (score music here)"" to pull her parents out of their money-rut.

All seems to be going well until Victor fouls up his vows during the wedding rehearsal and runs off into the nearby forest. He continues to practice the vows as he stumbles through the trees, finally getting the words right and then ceremoniously placing the ring on a nearby twig ...at least that's what he thought it was. The twig turns out to be the dead finger of the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter). She and Victor are now husband and wife, and she emerges from the grave to tell him so. Running away from her and plowing into a tree, Victor falls unconscious, only to awaken in the underworld of the dead.

Confusion reigns as Victor tries to tell the Corpse Bride that they cannot be married ...because he is still alive and she is dead. Well, there certainly is an easy way to fix that. But what of his living bride-to-be, Victoria? How will she take the news?

___________________________________________________________________________________

The Corpse Bride has a lot going for it, but also a few issues. The positives far outweigh the negatives, however. Most enjoyable (from my perspective) were the miniatures and the way the ""claymation"" flowed. The clay characters were smooth and outlandishly featured; Victoria's mother (Joanna Lumley) has hair that looks like two large breasts pinned high above her head, the Corpse Bride is disturbingly sexy, and the pastor (a perfect Christopher Lee) appears as an evil Vicar.

Similar to WALLACE AND GROMIT IN THE CURSE OF THE WERE-RABBIT, the claymation is smooth and even. Although Wallace and Gromit has a more children's feel to it, Corpse Bride makes no such claim. Necrophilia, frightening death sequences, bodily decay, and several other possibly unappetizing ideas pop-up during the film. But they are usually infused with sprinklings of comedy, which made these items less morbid.

The biggest ""hole"" in the movie was its script. Clocking in at just 75 minutes, there's very little time to get acquainted with the characters and even less time spent on making sense of the movie's ending (I'll only comment that when the Corpse Bride said, ""You have set me free."" I said, ""Huh?"").

But the claymation, beautifully crafted caricatures, and mini-sets can't be denied. Nor can most of the musical numbers that added a certain garish quality to it (although some of the songs seemed forced to me, while several others were spot-on).

I wouldn't let a child under 12 years old watch it, though. Adults will laugh at the humor thrown down at death's door, but the youngsters might not get it.",1140825600,,2917,4.963114754098361

2463247,5,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is a delightful film for all ages.  The film is not only fun to watch but is also a technological acheivemnet.  Stop motion animation, falling out of favor for the more cost effevtive (i.e., cheaper) CGI techniques, is shown to be far superior to computer animation in this film.  The charcters look 3D because they are 3D.  The motion is fluid and the characters are believable.

The musical score is brisk and lively and the actors voice their parts perfectly.  This  film didn't interest me when it was in the theaters.  However, I saw it playing at the local video store and had to take it home to watch it.  The making of the film featuretts are also well worth watching.

The film drives home the importance of commitment and of keeping ones word.  Values that seem to be underrated in todays world.  In short, Corpse Bridge is a film for the entire family: well made and entertaining from beginning to end.",1140480000,,939,4.590361445783133
2463248,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton set a high standard with The Nightmare Before Christmas but supplies audiences again with Corpse Bride, a re-telling of a Russian/Jewish folktale.  Sadly, the title character, Emily (the Corpse Bride), does not have herself a happy ending and her tale of her eminent demise (by murder for her money) is not the typical happy-ever-after associated in most animated films; still, the movie maintains an aura of whimsicality and jubilee despite its horror film-like antics.

This is another masterwork by the fertile mind of Tim Burton.

The casting is genius. Truly superb voice work by all of the cast, and animation beyond compare. It really is so wonderful that an artist like Burton will invest in a stop motion work of genius, when past-masters like Disney are bailing out to save money( read, make money).

The Film alone is worth the price, and the extras give an insight into the film making process, as well as the mind of Tim Burton.

Personally I Like Helena Bonham Carter's Character. And her role in this romantic drama, full of emotion, supernatural wonder, and true wonder, is just magical.

2463250,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton returns to the kind of darkly comical gothic material that helped establish his career and reputation with Corpse Bride. He's also gone back to the same kind of stop motion animation that he utilized so memorably in The Nightmare Before Christmas. The director has even re-teamed with long-time collaborators Johnny Depp, Michael Gough, composer Danny Elfman and screenwriter Caroline Thompson.

While the land of the living has a cold, almost monochrome colour scheme, the Underworld is a colourful place filled with all sorts of outrageous characters. There's a pub where a disembodied head is the head waiter, skeletons play pool in the background while others break into rousing musical numbers. This world is dominated by vibrant green and purple lighting with the pale (yet somewhat luminous) blue skin of the Bride. Like the Underworld in Beetlejuice, it is an infinitely more fun and interesting place to be than the land of the living.

""Inside the Two Worlds."" The filmmakers talk about the differences between the living world and the Underworld - mainly they were separated in terms of colour and tone.

""Danny Elfman Interprets the Two Worlds."" The veteran composer talks about the songs he wrote and his intentions behind them. He talks about the inspirations behind some of the songs, for example, Bojangles' tune was influenced by 1930s jazz music.

""The Animators: The Breath of Life"" examines the stop motion animation process done on this film. Mike Johnson did the day-to-day directorial duties while Burton acted more as a supervisor, guiding the entire project.

""Tim Burton: Dark vs. Light."" Cast and crew praise Burton's unique vision and it was his influence that allowed the film to be made utilizing stop motion animation, considered by many to be a dying art form.

""Voices from the Underworld"" focuses on the cast of voice actors assembled for the movie. It was very important to get the right voice for the right character. We see some of the cast in action, recording their parts.

""Making Puppets Tick"" examines how the film's puppets were assembled, the way they were sculpted and then painted. Burton would do the initial sketches and had the vision for what he wanted them to look like and then Carlos Grangel would design them.

""The Voices Behind the Voice"" allows us to watch a few scenes from the movie with footage of the various voice actors speaking their lines. It is interesting to see how much they get into the spirit of their roles.

""The Corpse Bride: Pre-Production Galleries"" is a montage of how various characters from the movie were assembled, including tests for movement and so on.

Also included is a ""Music-Only Track"" that allows you to watch the movie with only Elfman's excellent score playing.

When it was released on DVD I ended up grabbing a copy and found myself severely disappointed. The CB is visually stunning and the story has a much darker feel to it, but compared to Burton's true masterpiece ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" the CB falls short. First off the main characters in CB are nowhere near as impacting and memorable as TNBC's Jack and Sally. I also found the music, with the exception of Victors piano theme, too poppy and bland where as I found TNBC's soundtrack far more haunting and enjoyable. The visuals in the CB are absolutely stunning, but with the digital route Burton decided to go with, a lot of the raw appeal and warmth that you achieve with shooting stop motion on film is lost. All in all ""The Corpse Bride,"" is a decent film, but nowhere near ranks up with ""The Nightmare Before Christmas, which will always be Tim Burton's masterpiece.",1139875200,,1019,4.573770491803279
2463252,5,B000CEXEWU,This years Academy Award for best Animated Film should go to no other then Tim Burton's Corpse Bride.

Movie is primarily of a human marrying a Corpse Bride due to a mistake. Film has some great visuals. A great storyline and great music the animation is just beautiful and totally deserving the title of best Animated Film Of the Year lets just see if the Academy feels the same although all signs point to another Claymation film Wallace and Gromit The Curse Of The Were Rabbit is heavily favored to be Best Animated Picture Of the Year. It is a harder battle this year with for the first time in a couple years there is not a Disney owned Pixar movie in the spotlight. This is a great film for you or your kids so it is enjoyable by everyone and Warner Brothers continues a streak of some very good movies over the past year and proved to be the 2005 leader in a variety of films.,1139788800,,1034,4.5
2463253,5,B000CEXEWU,"In a day when glitzy animation is all the rage, you would think that stepping back to the foundations of making an animated feature would be suicidal at both the box office and at DVD release. How could such a feature hope to compete at all?

Tim Burton's CORPSE BRIDE eloquently answers that question. You start with an enchanting story about a socially inept young man whose arranged marriage to the daughter of his town's supposedly richest family sets in motion events that land him in the arms of a beguiling corpse named Emily.  Nothing works better and more enchantingly in telling this masterful tale than the stop motion animation employed by Tim Burton.

Add to that Burton's unparalleled imagination in juxtaposing scenes among the living and scenes among the dead. The gray-toned world that is ""alive"" is a far cry from the rollicking, brightly colored world of the dead. Morbid dirges characterize the breathing world while jazz is the sound of the day among a cast of high-stepping corpses who will keep your fingers snapping and toes tapping.

Burton's characters in CORPSE BRIDE are, as usual, wonderful. The viewer falls in love with Helena Bonham Carter's Corpse Bride, Emily, and with Johnny Depp's Victor but at the same time one can't help but feel for Victoria, Victor's mortal intended.

Danny Elfman's score and songs are really wonderful, adding the final touch to an animation masterpiece that nicely complements, in look, feel, and genre, Burton's NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

The DVD also includes several featurettes that wonderfully illustrate just what goes into making a movie like this!

2463254,5,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, one of those movies that you have to see.  One, because it is Tim Burton and two, because you know that Danny Elfman is going to be doing the music.

The movie begins like a full blown musical.  I myself have never been a fan of musicals but I had to give this one a chance because I knew the potential was there.  I was glad I did.

The stop motion effects in this movie are top notch.  They threw in some CG as well but it compliments the movie rather than taking away from it.  The production value of the movie is excellent, watching the puppets move and act makes you feel like you are a part of this imaginary world.

The music was fun and entertaining, especially when the main character first arrives in the very colorful afterlife.  The characters are fun and offer a variety blasts from the past.

I recommend this movie for anybody that might hate musicals.  It just might change your mind on the matter, at least in the respect of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman.  I also recommend it to those that like to be entertained by a short movie that appeals to all your senses.

The fact that he leans towards the darkside while still very lighthearted shows his unique perspective about life. Here lies the lesson he shows in each wonderful movie he creates, that dispite the darkness in our lives we can still find the light.

While all his movies do not end ""happily ever after"", one leaves having better seeing it. In this regard they attempt to deploy a deeper meaning through the lightheardednes of movie.

2463257,5,B000CEXEWU,"In the murkiest night the darkness wraps its shadowy blanket over all that is exposed.  Such a night is a fitting moment for the glum tale of Tim Burton's Corpse Bride directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson, which has its roots in Russian-Jewish folklore.  The actual tale called The Finger received a loose adaptation by the three screenwriters John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson, as they made some changes while preserving the strongest themes of the 19th century folktale.  Yet, the screenwriters delicately maintain the ominous atmosphere, which the two directors magically brought to life through groundbreaking stop-motion photography using, for the first time ever, a digital camera.  Despite the story's morose and macabre content, it is an event for young and old, as it allows the audience to experience a dark, yet wonderfully poignant tale of love.

The audience finds Corpse Bride situated in a time when rigid Victorian morality governs the upper class through strict control of emotions and low tolerance for any kind of overt behavior.  In many aspects, these strict societal rules almost prevent a person to live life, as the only proper thing was to completely suffocate the inner feelings such as love.  Strong Christian values govern the people and if over-stepping the social norms the consequences could be social rejection, which people of high status feared most of all.  However, there is also a double standard emerging in the film, as greed leads people on to seek fortune and status by all means necessary.

In the opening scene Victor Van Dort (Johnny Depp's voice) draws a live butterfly and then releases it into the open through the window.  Secretively, it shows the Victor values feelings and the moments of blissful joy, as the camera follows the butterfly through a montage displaying people's obsessions in life.  The first thing that comes into view is a number of clocks, all being exactly on time, as a man stands sweeping in unison with time.  It lets the mind ponder the monotony of life that many might suffer when becoming fixated with time.  Next we get to see people chopping the heads of fishes, which presents an interesting analogy to the Victorian time.  Fish is a symbol for life and fertility while here it is being completely decapitated.  In addition, the fishmongers do not seem to enjoy what they are doing, as they mechanically toss fish up in the cutting board, which again supports the notion of meaningless existence.  The opening montage sets the mood for the rest of the film, which is dark, ominous, and almost ill.

Swiftly the story hurries along, as the opening montage introduces all the main characters.  Soon the audience learns that there is to be an arranged marriage between the rich fishmonger family Van Dort and the soon-to-be destitute aristocrat family Everglot (family name sounds like a word play with gluttony.)  Victor is extremely nervous to meet his bride to be Victoria (Emily Watson's voice), as both are concerned whether they will love each other.  However, both sets of parents brush the notion of love away, as both families see an opportunity to gain either fortune, or social prestige of a title.

When Victor and Victoria meet each other for the first time all thoughts of worry in regards to whether they will love one another disappear, as Cupid's arrows simultaneously burrow itself into their chests.  Yet, the strong societal rules forbid them to express their emotions for each other.  Instead, Victor displays his newly acquired emotions for Victoria by stumbling on the words when rehearsing the wedding ceremony.  His clumsiness becomes paramount to the level that the priest suspends the wedding until Victor can remember the wedding vows.  In despair, Victor stumbles out Everglot's mansion of the repeating, stumbling, and stuttering the vows, until he finally gets them right and places the ring on what looks like a twig.  However, it is the bony remains of a corpse who awakens when Victor places the ring on her finger.  The voice of Helena Bonham Carter presents the corpse bride that Victor married by mistake.  Meanwhile, the malevolently sly Lord Barkis (Richard E. Grant's voice) sees an opportunity to seize Victoria, as his own bride.

It is a mesmerizing journey to follow Victor and his predicament of having married a dead woman while also trying to get back to the land of the living.  During Victor's stay in the Underworld an interesting notion emerges that one should cherish the moments of love and warm feelings while alive.  However, the strict moral codes by which the people live prohibits the people from fully discovering the true wonders of life such a love.  The Corpse Bride is not Burton's best, but it is a remarkable tale with an important message that will both entertain and keep the audience contemplating several issues including the importance of love.",1139702400,,4909,5.0

The movie is a musical too!! Basically all they do is sing, sing sing. They also play that dumb piano all the time. The movie is basically horrible. The storyline and plot isn't too good but is OK, and it is pretty dumb. The most wrong with it was all that stupid singing, followed by the movie wasn't AT ALL funny. I actually hate it. I actually wish I could have seen it at the movie theater, then I wouldn't have to be stuck with the stupid thing on a DVD in my house, NOT to mention it was like 18 bucks, I wish I never got it or wanted to see it. It SUCKS. If you are thinking this is going to be a funny movie, don't buy it you will be greatly disappointed like me, and if you don't like musicals, don't get it either. This is one of the worst movies ever, I hate it.",1139616000,,1172,3.847107438016529
2463259,5,B000CEXEWU,"Let me first start off by saying that I don't remember watching Nightmare Before Xmas when it first came out a few years back. So I can't compare the two. I don't feel it's right to compare the two either since they aren't connected in any way. Sure they are TB movies made with stop motion but they are wholly seperate entities otherwise. Now that I've said that, I will say that I in 10 years from now I will still rememebr Corpse Bride, unlike Nightmare Before Xmas. So I feel COrpse Bride is a better and more memerable movie. The movie is quaint, the story is simple, but everything has been executed flawlessy, from the voice acting, to the precise and minute details in the stop motion animation (the pillow scene, the tiny vase, the maggot, the corpse bride dress etc; at times I was amazed that this was made using puppets and not digitally enhanced using CGI tricks) The animation is phenominal. I've never seen a more rich an detailed stop motion movie.

I've seen a few major animated movies this year, some old such as Studio Ghibli anime like PomPoko, some new such as Curse of the Wererabbit. And I must say that Corpse Bride by far is my favorite and now one of the best animated movies I've seen.

I like the balance between the dark overall feel of this movie with the lighthearted humor that always pops up at the right time.  Also the movie does the job of telling the story without being too long.

There are some scary images in this movie that could spook the little ones, but overall nothing offensive compared to the crap that Hollywood is putting out on a daily basis.",1139529600,,712,4.438461538461539

When it ended we looked at each other and I told him it was just ok for me.  He agreed.  I told him I wasn't going to be buying it, but he said he liked it enough to own it.

2463264,5,B000CEXEWU,"""Corpse Bride"" isn't quite up to the level of ""Nightmare Before Christmas,"" but it's an entertaining and engaging little movie. (I say ""little"" because the running time, excluding credits, is only 73 minutes.) The visuals are marvelous, and the performances by the actors providing the characters' voices are all more than adequate. There are numerous ""in jokes"" scattered throughout the movie. These are mostly visual, although some are not;  the voice of the worm in Emily's eye socket is clearly patterned on Peter Lorre.  The movie's one weakness, if it has one, is a fairly trite plot. There's not much here that you couldn't guess after the first 15 minutes, but the storyline never drags.

There are numerous extras on the DVD, and unlike the filler on many discs, they're all pretty interesting. You get to see what was involved in producing many of the special effects, and learn about the philosophy underlying the production.  Overall, this DVD is a winner; I'd rate it 4.5 stars if that were possible. I gave it five stars to bring the average up a bit.",1139270400,,1065,4.835164835164835

Instead of renting it, I decided to purchase, trusting it would have artwork I'd want to watch again, and that maybe one day when my kids are older, they'll enjoy watching it.  No regrets in this buy.  It was very fun.  I was nervous when reading the negative reviews here that I'd hate the music, but I liked the musical numbers.  And I really liked the story.  The stop-action animation is amazing enough to watch this movie, but there is so much more to enjoy.

As far as kids, this film has quite a different feel than, say, a Disney's Aladdin, but there are no scenes quite as scary and suspenseful as Aladdin contains.  It instead has creepy little characters that happen to be quite friendly.  (SPOILER!  I adore the scene when the dead came up among the living-- old couples reunited, a child hugging a long-missed grandpa, dogs sniffing each other).  True, I won't show this movie to my kids until they are AT LEAST 6 or 7... but honestly, that's how I feel about nearly every film marketed to children out there.  The only villian in this film was a living man, and he wasn't scary.  It's the manipulative Scar from Lion King or frightening villian in Anastasia (both great films) that happen to seem more scary to me.  Oh, and nobody is left an orphan early on in this film either.

I spent the entire second act feeling sorry for all of the principal characters and without any humor it just weighed me down. Again, if there had been any humor element at all, it wouldn't have been such a downer.

The villainous character receives his dues at the end in a last-ditch effort to satisfy the audience. It was so contrived. He brings about his own demise by grabbing a sitting goblet and drinking it, without any real idea of its contents. It felt like a simplistic device to bring about what the audience was naturally waiting for.

Bumbling Victor, unable to remember his wedding vows at the rehearsal wanders into the forest and unwittingly marries Emily, the corpse bride.  Should Victor stay in this strange underworld of the dead, or should he try and get back to the living and prevent the marriage of Victoria to a scheming count?

Burton deftly uses a dark image of the living world that is abruptly the opposite of the colorful world of the dead.  Danny Elfman's songs and score are perfect and Burton utilizes a talented voice cast including Johnny Depp, Emily Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, and Albert Finney.

2463271,5,B000CEXEWU,"""Hey, give me a listen
Your corpses of cheer
At least those of you
Who still got an ear
I'll tell you a story
Make a skeleton cry
Of our own jubiliciously
Lovely Corpse Bride""

""Tim Burtons' Corpse Bride"" is a film that may well suffer from heightened expectations, given the place that ""Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas"" has in popular culture and the long period we had to wait for a second hauntingly animated film done with similarly distinctive characters.  But this 2005 film, which has just been nominated for the Best Animated Feature Academy Award in time for its DVD release, has its own charm and will win its own cadre of devotees that will want a figure of the lovely Corpse Bride on their nightstand.  After all, there is something poignant in the question: can a heart still break once it has stopped beating?

Directed by both Burton and Mike Johnson (who animated ""James and the Giant Peach""), this is the story of the unlikely love triangle in which Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp) finds himself involved.  A marriage has been arranged between Victor and Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson).  His parents, who sell fish, want the prestige of being associated with the Everglots, while her parents, who are secretly broke, want the neuvo riche money of the Van Dorts.  The prospect of marrying a woman he has just met is rather daunting to Victor and after botching the rehearsal he goes off into the woods to practice his vows, which is how he comes to accidentally marry the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter).  She brings Victor home to meet her friends and he ends up taking her to the land of the living to meet his parents.  He tries to explain that he never wanted to marry a corpse (who does?), but his character is such that he does not want to hurt her with the truth and he is touched by her wedding gift and the fact she had a real name (Emily) and a tragic story (apparently murdered by her fianc?e for the family jewels).

There are additional complications in that Victor still has feeling for Victoria, whose parents quickly find another groom, Lord Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant), as news spreads that Victor has eloped with a charming corpse.  If Victoria is going to get married, then perhaps Victor should make sure he and Emily get a proper wedding as well (""Dearly beloved and departed,"" intones the skeleton presiding over the ceremony).  Meanwhile, Burton and Johnson are filling the frame with macabre character details in the tradition of wall-to-wall visual delights within the frame that is the hallmark of contemporary animation, whether it is computer generated, stop motion, or the truly old school method of painting images on cels.

If ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" took great pleasure in having the creatures of Halloween take over the symbols of Yuletide, then ""Corpse Bride"" is content to turn the worlds of the living and the dead upside down.  The living are done in the washed out browns of a daguerreotype while the dead are shown in brighter colors favoring a blue palette.  For the most part the living are dreary, hateful, and ultimately boring people, while the dead all seem to be jumping around a lot more than they probably did when they were alive.  Their songs are perkier too (i.e., ""Remains of the Day""), or at least more revealing (i.e., ""Tears to Shed""), than those sung by the living (i.e., ""According to Plan"").  Plus, I like any fight scene where I can yell, ""Look out! He has a fork!""

I ended up rounding up on ""Corpse Bride"" for several reasons.  First, the title character has a compelling beauty with her large eyes and lovely blue skin, especially as she glides around in her billowing wedding dress.  Second, I just like this style of animation, pretty much regardless of what is happening in the story but especially since it always strikes me as being in the spirit of Chas. Addams (Morticia and Emily have to be related on some level, right?).  Third, given that both Emily and Victoria are sympathetic characters, I could not see how ""Corpse Bridge"" was going to come up with anything approaching an actual happy ending, so I was pleasantly surprised (even though Johnson and Burton foreshadow Emily's fate before the movie's title pops up on the screen).  There is also the nice touch when the film underscores the fact that social class distinctions do not matter when you are dead, even if you are not gone as well as the final irony that it is death that sets the lovers free to be happy at last.

""Die, die, we all pass away
But don't wear a frown
Because it's really okay
You might try and hide
And you might try to pray
But we all end up
The remains of the day""",1139011200,,4675,4.646844660194175
2463272,4,B000CEXEWU,"After seeing The Nightmare Before Christmas about five-hundred times (that may not be an exaggeration), and loving it every time I saw it, I couldn't wait to get something new from the same creator as Nightmare. Corpse Bride was that something new, and though Nightmare is definitely the better of the two, Corpse Bride is still fun and entertaining nonetheless.

It revolves around the arranged marriage of two young people, names of Victor and Victoria, both of whom have no idea what they are getting into until the very last moments before the marriage. But surprisingly, at the rehearsal, they have a connection, and their marriage seems as though it won't be such a bad thing. Still, though, Victor is nervous to the point of bumbling, and fails his marriage vows miserably. Told to practice his lines, the rehearsal is postponed and Victor makes a quick escape into the woods. While here, he practices on the nearby trees, only not everything is a tree. In accident, he places his ring on the hand of a dead woman named Emily, who becomes Victor's corpse bride. From here, Victor must find a way to escape from the land of the dead and get back to his fiancee Victoria, while we, the viewers, are trying to figure out how the corpse bride got to where she is now.

Though short, Corpse Bride still has a lot to offer. The animation is great, far more detailed than Nightmare, and the moody settings are what you expect from Tim Burton. And the character designs are excellent; every one is unique from the rest and all of them have personality. To add to that, the voice acting was exceptional as well, with songs that sound similar to that of The Nightmare Before Christmas. And where the length of the film may not be so much, the DVD extras surely make up for it.

I'd recommend this to anyone who liked The Nightmare Before Christmas, or who grew up watching the claymation Christmas cartoons. Also, as an artistic film, there are few to rival Corpse Bride. It sets a dreary mood at the beginning, and continually adds to that mood throughout, yet is still able to draw laughs.",1138924800,,2088,4.622641509433962

The animation is fantastic. While this might not be as enchanting as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" it's a worthy follow-up. Tim and Johnny Depp scored big twice last year with this movie and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" I'd recommend that also. They're a good team. So buy ""Corpse Bride"" if you have seen it or if you haven't. If you like a slightly twisted take on things, grab this DVD immediately.",1138924800,,685,4.236641221374046

2463275,5,B000CEXEWU,"Now I should get this out of the way: I LOVE Nightmare Before Christmas. I still love the songs, characters and everything. So when they make the spiritual sequel, you're going to inevitably love it, unless they do something stupid. Well Corpse Bride isn't a failure, it's a bit ""resting on laurels"" feel. It's of course a visually striking movie but it doesn't feel as innovative as Nightmare was.

Victor is having an arranged marriage with Victoria, which'll bring up the family's money of course. Completely blowing his vow rehearsal, he goes off to the woods to practice and places his ring on a skinny branch. Only it's not a branch but the finger of the Corpse Bride. Taken into the world of the dead, he must deal with not only his new bride's devotion but his intended fiance being married off to a slimy guy(as usual).

Now for you parents out there who are very apprehensive about letting kids watch this kind of stuff, I'd say watch it with them rather than letting it be a babysitter. It can get creepy for kids and there's even morbid things such as a dead resident who literally separates himself. Of course it's animated and there's enough fairy tale qualities to keep it from being disturbing.

Where the film shines is its animation and voice acting. More fluid and striking than Nightmare, it's obvious close to 15 years will improve the artform. And of course we have the upcoming Wallace and Gromit movie which shows we don't need fancy computers to tell stories. In the 5th collaboration with Tim Burton, Johnny Depp has that perfect shy guy voice and is very likable but we also have Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Burton's real-life love Helena Bonham Carter.

Now the comparisons between this and Nightmare are obvious and very unwarranted although sometimes there's similarities. Victor goes into the woods where he's introduced to a new world, such as Jack finding the holiday trees. The bride falls apart literally at times just like Sally and Victor has a dead dog only this one isn't a flying ghost but rather a skeletal puppy. But that's like saying Sleepy Hollow is similar in look to Batman Returns. It's the same filmmaker so it's bound to have similar ideas.

It's no Nightmare that's for sure but it's sure a great film overall.",1138838400,,2282,4.738035264483627
2463276,5,B000CEXEWU,"I wouldn't say the Corpse Bride isn't for ages nine and below! In fact, I remember being in love with The Nightnare Before Christmas when I was eight and the movie has never given me nightmares or negativly effected me in any way. It's been over ten years and I still have my original copy of Nightmare!

I have to say, when I first heard of  The Corpse Bride I was a little skeptical. What with Disney overdoing the sequals I figured Tim Burton had finally jumped the bandwagon -- but a true artist NEVER does that!

I was so impressed with this movie when I saw it that I wanted to sit up all night watching it again and again. It's very original, fun, and -- in some places -- even moving. The tale of the Corpse Bride is quite sad, and the glimpse this movie provides into the Victorian era is quite uplifting. I have to say, I'm VERY glad I was born when I was born and not in a time when my parents could marry me off to an evil man in exchange for gold.

One of the things I love most about this movie (besides Johnny Depp) is its music. I can't get enough of Victor's piano playing and I wish they'd let him play for Victoria forever and ever while she, standing nearby and smiling, watches him forever and ever with lover-like admiration.

Such inventiveness and creativity can only be expected from the man who created the beloved classics: James and the Giant Peach, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, and BeetleJuice.

Once again Burton/Elfman create a magical, dark, gothic, musical world which makes the world of the dead look more lively and exciting than that of the living.  It's about Victor, who is set to marry Victoria via arranged marriage (while both sets of parents are annoying the two betrothed actually end up liking eachother).  Well Victor is practicing his vows and accidently marries Emily, the corpse bride.  I really liked this movie, the only con it was a little predictable and a little short.

I personally enjoyed this movie.  I do think a big flaw is that the characters could have been developed a bit more (especially in the case of Victoria, considering her role in the film), but truthfully, almost none of Burton's films have had really major character development.  It's not really what he's about, I think his movies are more about amazing visuals and just simply taking you on a imaginative ride for a little while.  That stated, I also think the characters and plot are up to snuff with the rest to make it all come together as a good film.

On to the music now..ah yes..Mr. Elfman.  By far my favorite film music composer, if not one of my favorite composers in general.  Yes, it's true, the songs (especially after hearing the songs from NBC) seem somewhat lackluster.  I have the soundtrack, and I have found that a few of these songs can become insanely catchy after a while of listening (check out Remains of the Day if you don't believe me).  It does sound like it may have been a bit rushed, but, imho, Elfman's rushed score still equals genius compared to most stuff out there.  It's got a main theme, like all his scores, and although it echoes some older Burton films in the vibes it has, it still has a sound all it's own.  I mean, I rather say that is Elfman having his own style, not rehashing old ideas.

I'm very glad I did.

This movie comes nowhere near the genius of Nightmare; it's a tepid and insipid story that lacks energy, set to a totally forgettable score by Danny Elfman (another huge disappointment of this movie).

However, after it had been released for about a month or so, finding myself bored on a Saturday afternoon I went to the movies, and I must say I was delighted with what I saw.

This film is one of the most creative and inventive in Tim Burton's long and remarkable career.  The stop-motion animation technique that was pioneered with ""Nightmare"" is absolutely flawless in this film.  Coupled with the enhanced visual and computer effects that are available to filmmakers today, the visuals in ""Corpse Bride"" are some of the most beautiful to ever grace the silver screen.  From start to finish, watching this movie is like being taken into someone's beautiful dream world and being set loose for 75 minutes.  It's truly remarkable.

The voice acting of Johnny Depp is perfect.  It is high time that someone utilized Johnny's remarkable talent to voice an animated character, and Tim Burton is the perfect creator to bring out Johnny's best, even when he is just supplying a voice to an animated character.

This is a very very beautifully made and sweet movie.  The concept and characters may be scary or frightening to some younger viewers, but there is enough heart and originality in this movie that I believe it is perfect for all audiences.  Don't miss this movie.",1138665600,,1602,4.936567164179104

2463284,4,B000CEXEWU,"Old-timers might hark back to an early Disney cartoon called ""Skeleton Dance"" when Tim Burton's 'dead' fantasy kicks into gear inside the underworld of the dead. In any case, there's lots of fun to be had here for young and old alike, and there's no point in belaboring the hi-concept plotline that pits a reluctant suitor against a woman that he's accidentally married while his one true love is being whisked into the arms of another man.

There are some musical interludes within the storyline as well as classical music performed on piano, but there aren't enough 'numbers' to call this a bonified musical comedy, or musical 'black' comedy. Best of all, the Burton-Danny Elfman collaboration kicks into high gear and allows Danny to revisit his 'Oingo-Boingo' days with a progressive jazz feel in at least one of the songs.

Overall, it's amazing that Tim Burton has gotten over his need to overdo certain elements at the expense of audience patience while settling for an almost perfect entertainment formula. You might say he's gone Hollywood, but in this case it's all for the best. Now everybody can enjoy a Tim Burton film!

What more do you need to know, check this one out! MUST-SEE viewing for Burton fans and anyone who's ever seen ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (which I still would like to see on the BIG screen - hear that midnite movie programmers).

2463286,1,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton tries to recreate the magic from his masterpiece, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and fails miserably.

The songs are boring and unclever, the plot barely there and full of holes, and the voice acting uninspired.

The only saving grace is the art works, which is pretty neat looking. If you're looking for a great movie to watch, skip this. If you're looking for something to watch while slicing yourself, watch this movie on mute with My Chemical Romance playing.",1138147200,,475,4.925
2463287,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton is one of the best. My favorite movie of all time was Nightmare Before Christmas, so i had high hopes for this movie, of which were mostly filled. I will say, while not his best, it's not as bad as James and the Giant Peach was, but it wasn't as good as Nightmare.

There a couple of parts of this movie that are WAY to predictable, but its still an all around good movie. 4.5 stars",1138060800,,393,4.038461538461538
2463288,5,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton once again makes us laugh at the folly of our own mortality without managing to insult us. It's lovely to imagine that when we die, there will be a pub we can relax in, and all the aches and pains we exprienced will fade. It's nice to know we'll have nothing to fear...

Corpse Bride captures all these things and more! You wouldn't think so, given the title, however it presents a complex love story, and caused me to think deeply about what life is really about. Any story that can do this, in my book, is a masterpiece.

This film also gives us a scrumptious look into the two worlds through stop-motion animation. It is fantastic! The art has come a long way since Nightmare (though I don't think it's fair to compare the two) and moves very beautifully. The ending is bitter-sweet, as is life, and it moved me to tears.

I went opening night (being the Burton groupy that I am) and there were many like me there. We cheered at the ending and gasped at the plot twists. I do have to say, however, this movie would be a little much for children. It gets very close to the edge of what we are comfortable with: The idea of a man falling for a dead woman, the dead rising up and joining us at dinner, seeing people we've lost after many years in the underworld, etc...

All in all, I thought this was brilliant. See it for yourself and you'll understand. If you're a Tim Burton fan and behold his work with great affection like I do, you'll be taken in by the first few frames of animation.

Corpse Bride is spectacular!",1137974400,,1532,4.305555555555555

It's as if somebody took a plot synopsis from that movie and simply changed a few things around, threw in a few dozen plot holes, and robbed the characters of anything interesting. The Danny Elfman songs also sounded like spoiled Nightmare leftovers.

Luckily, there are some plusses. The animation is beautiful and the gags are very funny. This is a Tim Burton movie, so there is bound to be some amazing twisted visuals, and the goods are delivered there. It's still a major dissapointment, though.",1137542400,,661,4.954954954954955
2463291,5,B000CEXEWU,"Saw this movie opening day and I have to say that I was pleased, once again, by the mastermind Tim Burton.

I see alot of reviews saying that it wasn't as good a ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", but he didn't make it as a sequel or a prequel.  So really, it's unfair to this movie to compare it to a totally unrelated movie, or any movie for that matter.

I've also heard alot of things saying, ""I knew Depp was a necrophiliac!""  To quote Johnny Depp himself in his autobiography, ""If people are debating my sexuality then they have far too much time on their hands"".  The fact of the matter is that Tim Burton started Depp off in his acting career from late teen years all the way into adulthood.  He said that if Burton wanted him to stare at a camera for five hours he'd do it for him.  So naturally, Depp did this movie.

And I end this lesson/review with once again, I vote five stars.

Despite my disdain towards Tim Burton (including the fact that he references nearly all of his films in 'Corpse Bride'), I have found myself to enjoy this movie. Personally, not a mandatory purchase, but worth a rent if you are looking for a decent movie in an attempt to woo the girl (or whatever) that finally took up your offer to see a movie.",1136937600,,640,4.672566371681416

2463295,5,B000CEXEWU,"Corpse Bride"" is Tim Burton's long-awaited stop motion follow-up to the brilliant ""A Nightmare Before Christmas."" This time, he does not just come up with the story and characters. He directs as well, with Mike Johnson as co-director.

Presenting subjects that are typically dark and frightening and showing them in a positive light has long been a trademark of Tim Burton. In ""Corpse Bride,"" Burton spins death and murder into a charming musical about the power of love.

""Corpse Bride"" is supposedly based on actual events that occurred in 19th century Russia, at a time when anti-Semitism was widespread in Eastern Europe. Very often, bands of anti-Semites would waylay a Jewish wedding party on their way to the wedding. And because the bride would be the one to bear future generations, she would be ripped out of the carriage, murdered, and buried in her wedding gown. Burton uses this tale as a backdrop for his story, and moves the setting from Russia to England.

The plot concerns Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp,) who is engaged to be married to Victoria (Emily Watson). The two have never met, except in the title of a Blake Edwards comedy, but when they're finally introduced, they are surprised to find that, despite everything, they love each other.

During the wedding rehearsal, shy Victor cannot remember his vows. While practicing in the forest, he mistakenly places the ring on the finger of Emily, a murdered woman (Helena Bonham Carter,) is immediately married to her, and taken to the underworld to live as her husband.

While Victor searches for a way out of the underworld and back to Victoria, he learns of the devious plot of how Emily was murdered and experiences the beauty and charm that still resides in her. Victor must decide whom he loves more: his bride-to-be or his corpse bride.

Tim Burton is one of my favorite directors, and, in my opinion, a visual genius, so I had very high expectations for ""Corpse Bride."" I have to say, I was not disappointed one bit. ""Corpse Bride"" is a beautiful, charming, fun-filled and suspenseful musical-comic mystery.

While morbid even by Burton's standards, the material ultimately could not be more good-natured or benign. Even when the dead stage a literal uprising in the third act, it only reinforces the notion that death itself is not the true enemy - a Burton theme that dates all the way back to 1988's ""Beetlejuice,"" to which ""Corpse Bride"" draws countless other graphic and thematic references.

""Corpse Bride"" is Tim Burton's second film of 2005. His previous film, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" was a whimsical delight, and ""Corpse Bride"" is no exception. It is an inventive and delightful movie that ranks with Burton's best film achievements. However, I can't see it having the playability with the younger set the way Nightmare Before Christmas does, based on its subject matter and grotesque images.

Critics have been very kind to the film upon release, and it definitely deserves its accolades. I absolutely loved the Corpse Bride and feel it is worthy of applause. This is one of the best films to come out in years. I can't wait for the DVD!",1136505600,,3138,4.883458646616542
2463296,5,B000CEXEWU,"OK, you're probably wondering why I would use the word ""charming"" as one of the descriptions in the title about a movie dealing with dead folks.  For those who have seen the movie, no explanation is necessary; as for those who haven't....

Frankly, I didn't know what to expect as I sat in the theatre and the movie began, as visions of popping eyeballs usually belong to a story in the horror genre.  After five minutes, however, I found myself totally wrapped up in the unbelieveably beautiful imagery, interesting storyline, and great music contained in this tale of a sad, beautiful (but dead) young lady who finds herself supposedly married to this nervous, appealing and very confused (but alive) young man.

In fact, early on I began to think that this plot and the characters (as well as the setting and music) somehow spelled ""folktale"", and later I was to discover my intuition was correct.  The story comes from a Russian fable (hence the snowy scenes and Rachmaninoff music) and as most such tales, entertains as well as carries a moral lesson.  In this case, the story tells us to appreciate life while we can, even though in the plot it is the dead who have to demonstrate (through words, delightful songs, dance and humor) this important fact that we seem to have forgotten.

The voices are done to perfection, as one would expect from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.  But the other actors and actresses deserve credit too, as everyone in this cast is brilliant.  It seems like it was an opportunity to have fun with a character without having to worry about the physical aspects of acting, and the cast has taken full advantage of this chance to use voice expression in a fun way.

Last but not least, one cannot help but be awed by the magnificent work done in bringing this movie to life.  At times, I found myself forgetting these characters were not real people!  Also fun is watching the background, which often contains interesting dead folk and/or a physical joke scenario.

Thank you, Tim Burton, you are a man after my own heart.  ""Dark"" and ""humor"", like the Corpse Bride and Victor, are happily married in this amazing example of cinematic brilliance.",1136332800,,2184,4.728232189973615
2463297,4,B000CEXEWU,"In Tim Burton's dazzling Corpse Bride, both Tim Burton fan freaks (I was raised on Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice) and new inductees alike will find something to like here. The exceptional stop-motion animation (which has seen an upgrade since 1993's classic Nightmare Before Christmas) joins with top-notch voice talent (Depp and Helena Bonham Carter stand out here) and typically good score/musical work from genius Danny Elfman to create a wonderful movie-going experience. Yes, this is a movie for anyone - in fact, I think teens and young adults will enjoy it more than younger kids with its dark at times bold humor and fast-paced banter (particulary in the clever songs). NO, it is not as good as Nightmare Before Xmas, but it may be that it would be hard for any film to match that picture. As usual, Tim Burton is always at the top of his game when he sticks to his favorite formula - exploring the darkness of the human soul with off-beat humor. Well-paced and a terrific ending wrap up this well-crafted package! 9/10 stars - it's awesome.",1136246400,,1055,4.834254143646409
2463298,4,B000CEXEWU,"No matter what one might say about the types of movies that Tim Burton directs and makes, one cannot deny that even after 20 years of being a big time Hollywood director, Burton still remains as one of the most imaginative directors making movies. Sure often his films are quite bizarre, gothic, and quite a bit quirky. At times they can be a bit morbid and he tends to rely on visuals rather than plot or a huge amount of character development. Nevertheless, Burton's films remain as some of the most imaginative movies being made.

Take for instance his latest picture, THE CORPSE BRIDE. Even though the film took around 5 years to be made, it has been released just a few months after Burton's fairly successful CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (the studios wanted to ride the coat tails of CHARLIE's hype). The movie is a stop-motion animated film and is based off an old Ukrainian folk tale. In the story, we have young Victor. Victor is the son of a wealthy and up and coming fish marketer. His father and mother were impoverished people, but through hard work and free enterprise have become wealthy. Wealthy enough, in fact, that one of the town's most established families wants to have their daughter, Victoria married to Victor. Victor and Victoria have never met; it is an arranged marriage. Upon meeting each other the couple connects and they realize very much that they want to be married to each other. However, Victor is a nervous person and can't seem to remember his lines at the wedding rehearsal. The rehearsal is characterized as a disaster and Victor seeks shelter in the forest so that he might practice his lines.

Practice he does. Until finally he has them down pat. Place the wedding ring for Victoria upon a limb of what he assumes is a dead branch, he says his lines perfectly. Except, the branch really wasn't a branch but was the finger of the Corpse Bride: a young woman named Emily who was murdered on the spot while awaiting for her beloved to take her away. Victor is chased, faints, and visits the underworld. Meanwhile the plot thickens above ground as Victoria's parents arrange for her to be married to a sly, older newcomer who has devilish plans of his own. Victor is presented with the challenge of trying to get back to Victoria, yet not hurt Emily while remaining true to his ideals and sense of honor. The Corpse Bride on the other hand has to decide if she is willing to have love ever after, but at the sake of hurting another in the same way that she was.

THE CORPSE BRIDE isn't a movie for young children. However, it is an entertaining film that those over the age of 11 on up can enjoy. I enjoyed watching this film. There were a few moments that were quite funny, e.g. the skeleton band and some that were a little frightening, e.g. when the dead all rise and march to church for a wedding. However, there really isn't anything in the movie that is gross, sick, or graphic. I highly recommended the movie for any Burton fan, fans of stop-animation, and anyone who has an interest in the macabre or Eastern European folktales.",1135382400,,3080,4.576086956521739
2463299,5,B000CEXEWU,"Corpse Bride (Widescreen Edition) is an awesome creation from Tim Burton and is right up their with ""Nightmare before Christmas"". I love the music, the witty humor and the Jonny Depp once more shows himself to be one of the best actors ever. I love it how he pokes fun at Victorian society and the parents of the girl show the boorish behavior that is common with the nobility of the time. One problem is that it feels way to short and it could have been a little longer and 76 minutes does feel a bit rushed. Still and all it was a splendid movie that should not be missed.",1134518400,,574,4.2272727272727275
2463300,5,B000CEXEWU,"Being a fan of Tim Burton's movies, I knew I had to watch ""Corpse Bride"" sooner or later. I finally decided to see this film, and was not disappointed one bit.

The story starts off with Victor Van Dort (voiced by Johnny Depp), a young man who is engaged to Victoria Everglot (voiced by Emily Watson). During their wedding rehearsal, Victor forgets his vows, drops the ring, and sets Mrs. Everglot's (Victoria's mother) dress on fire. He is ordered to practice harder if he wants to get married to Victoria. After the rehearsal, he walks through the forest to practice on his speech. He does it perfectly, and puts the ring on a twig on the ground. However, this twig turns out to be the hand of a corpse bride (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter), and since he said his vows and placed the ring on her finger, he is now married to her. She takes him to the underworld, where he must reside forever. At first, he tries his best to leave and go back to his own world, but once he learns about the history of the corpse bride, and spends time with her, he starts to develop feelings for her. Unfortunately, he also finds out that Victoria is engaged to marry Lord Barkis (voiced by Richard E. Grant), an evil and greedy man, and now Victor must decide who he loves and wants to spend his life with.

The movie starts off a little slowly, but quickly develops once Victor finds himself in the complicated situation. Director Tim Burton once again dazzles us with a wonderful movie filled with fantasy, comedy and adventure. I don't know how well it is compared to ""Nightmare before Christmas"" because I haven't seen that yet, but I think the animation in this movie was terrific! Of course, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter did a fantastic job in providing their voices for the characters, as did the rest of the cast. The songs were delightful and added well to the movie.

All in all, ""Corpse Bride"" was a wonderful movie which I would definitely watch more than once.",1134259200,,1967,4.504201680672269
2463301,4,B000CEXEWU,"i have a big weakness for tim burton, but he's certainly not infallible (can you say, ""planet of the apes remake""?) this is an enjoyable, highly stylized romp. however, the better realized part of the storyline centers around the dull, staid aspects of victorian society, while the undeniably more colorful world of the dead comes off as a significantly watered down version of burton and elfman's previous work in ""nightmare before christmas."" in burton's previous animated effort, the viewer recieves a dynamic view of life in the macabre halloweentown. in ""corpse bride,"" the majority of important plot elements take place in the drear and stuffiness of victorian england, with the wild, almost hedonistic world of the dead acting as occasional relief. nonetheless, burton's ""real world"" in the film is full of forbidding rigidity and respectability which is reinforced by the drab grey color scheme chosen to represent everyday life. in fact, burton elicits greater discomfort from the ""real world"" sequences than from his depiction of the afterlife. while the reviewer certainly understands the intent behind this, it would have been nice to see further scenes elucidating life beyond the grave.

the animation also echoes ""nightmare"" and is quite well done. the cast is highlighted by several extremely talented contemporary actors, including johnny depp as victor, emily watson as his living bride victoria, helena bonham carter as the corpse bride emily, tracey ullman as victor's mother, and joanna lumley as victoria's mother. however, these fantastic talents are largely under-used as characters who are one-sided, archetypical, and representative. for example, ullman's character is a social climber and the embodiment of the nouveau riche, while lumley acts as a counterpart in her role as old money with no money, but oodles of property. depp's victor is charmingly introverted, expressing himself best through music, but his apparent inability to decide between two very different women casts doubt on whether or not he is truly in love with either girl. granted, his affair with the corpse bride begins as a non-consensual entanglement, and his marriage to victoria has been mutually arranged by both sets of parents. anyway, apparently both ladies are restrained by victorian-era propriety from clawing each others' eyes out (in any case, one of the corpse bride's eyes isn't very likely to remain attached, not to mention her other body parts). the reviewer wouldn't even bother to harp on this over-simplification of character, except that the filmmakers strive to implement ambiguity throughout the plot in order to make it unclear whether victor will ultimately choose victoria or emily.

the storyline is essentially a fairytale, however, and should be viewed as such, with the hero victor overcoming various obstacles in order to finally win the heroine victoria. in an unusual twist for a traditional fairy tale, victoria is a real person with her own struggles: she is confined by the restraints of the society she lives in (as when her chosen confidant, pastor gallswells, betrays her by delivering her home to her oppresive parents), then declared mad, then forced to deal with sinister swain barkis bittern.  the corpse bride has her own obstacle to confront in the form of the spectre of her own past. these three separate plot lines are nicely (though somewhat predictably) tied together at the end of the film. in this way, the film is a pleasant, engaging tale of adventure and romance.

perhaps the weakest part of the film is the insistance upon including musical content. much of the time spent in the world of the dead is spent on gratuitous songs that add little depth to characters or plot. elfman is still a competent composer, of course, though his inclusion in the movie seems a mere afterthought. he distinguishes well between the classical elements of the victorian reality and the jazzy, vaudeville aspects of the afterlife.

ultimately, however, the film is moving and adorable and will likely bring about more than one sentimentally teary eye. burton executes an old russian folktale with his usual morbid finesse and creates several memorable characters (who are, admittedly, not as memorable as those from his previous animated release).",1133913600,,4285,5.240524781341108

While watching this movie I didn't think for one second that it was goth at all. This is mainstream crap that trys to appeal to to many different groups at once, and fails at all attempts. The songs were very boring and forgettable. Plus, the movie spawned a whole horrifying army of prep-turned-'goths' who wear ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Corpse Bride"" because it was the first thing they saw at that one 'cool store', Hot Topic, thus making themselves cool among so called friends who only like them because they're popular. ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was and is extremely overrated. While it is a somewhat enjoyable movie, is does not accomplish anything by the end and is just another animated movie.",1133568000,,912,4.8152866242038215
2463305,3,B000CEXEWU,"Time Burton's ""Corpse Bride"" is a nice film, but just doesn't come quite together for the audience.  I brought my daughter of four years to check this flick out.  I didn't mind doing this since I've enjoyed almost all of Burton's films.  The story, though somewhat garish, is a simple case of mistaken intentions.  Johnny Depp's character, Victor, is so nervous to get married to a young woman named Victoria (Emily Watson) that he fumbles his lines during the rehearsal.  Embarrassed after a clumsy series of events, he runs out into the forest to practice his lines.  While going through the motions, he inadvertantly awakens a corpse bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter).  She thinks he is intending to marry her and takes him as her husband.

As the story unfolds, we learn that Victor does have feelings for Victoria AND he feels sorry for poor Emily.  We also learn that there is a dark villain with alterior motives using Victor's misfortune in his favor.

The characters are all quite wonderful, especially since they are voiced by the likes of Christopher Lee, Joanne Lumley, Richard E. Grant and Tracey Ullman.  The humans, in typical Burton fashion, live in a dull world of greys and blacks while the dead are having a vibrant and colorful party down below.  The addition of Scraps the dog was also fun, especially for the children.

The set design was brilliant.  I have no complaint there.  The stop-motion animation was perfect and at its quirky best.  Notice the name of the piano manufacturer on the front of the piano when Victor and Victoria first meet.  It reminds everyone where all of this stop-motion animation began.  Burton definitely knows who deserves credit and he makes it clear on the piano.

My only real complaints are that the songs in the film felt uninspired and the story seems torn between being a children's folktale and a comedy.  There were times during the film that I caught myself checking my watch.  There were also times when my daughter got a little antsy in her seat and wanted to explore the theater.  It seems like it would have been a wonderful children's tale, but it takes the storyline almost too seriously for children to really enjoy it.  Even the scenes with the dancing skeletons became quite ho-hum after awhile.  As far as adults are concerned, once you adjust to the wonderful, stylized look of the film, you're left wondering when this film will get funny or at least a little silly.  In short, Burton seemed to interested in making this BOTH an adult and children's flick.  Plenty of other films make this work, like ""The Incredibles"" and ""Sky High.""  Unfortunately, Burton tried just a little too hard.

In closing I have to say that this isn't a bad film, it just gets a wee bit boring for the kiddies and the oldies while it attempts to attract both at the same time.  Brilliant scenery, full of atmosphere, but a dull storyline make ""Corpse Bride"" worthy of three stars.  I'd rent it or check it out at the discount theater (like I did) before buying it.",1133568000,,3023,4.702857142857143
2463306,2,B000CEXEWU,"It seems like basic Hollywood math. Tim Burton stop-motion animation the voices of Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney, and Christopher Lee = filmmaking at its finest. Still, Corpse Bride simply doesn't add up to much of anything.

If you've seen the previews for this films, you know the story already. Guy's marriage is aranged for him, he freaks out, goes into the woods, and accidentally marries a dead woman. Sounds Ashton Kutcher-esque to me.

And the previews also show some of the wonderfully lush and imaginative visuals that Tim Burton provides. Really, the detail and polish of the animation here puts Nightmare Before Christmas to shame. The opening shot of a butterfly flying around a European village was one of the most beautiful shots I've seen in an animated film since the ballroom scene in Beauty and the Beast. Still, interesting visuals are not enough to carry a film.

The biggest problem with Corpse Bride comes from one of Tim Burton's common filmmaking partners: Danny Elfman. While Elfman's songs for Nightmare Before Christmas were charming, well written, and integral to the story, the songs in corpse bride are uninteresting and unmemorable.  It's hard for yours truly--the self proclaimed musical theater --to say that the worst part of this film was its songs and it would have been much better without them, but it's the truth. While listening to the songs of Nightmare Before Christmas for the first time inspires you to go out and buy the soundtrack (which by the way is a great addition to one's CD collection), listening to the songs of Corpse Bride for the first time inspired me to vomit and to write to Tim Burton asking him to urge his wife, Ms. Bonham Carter, to stick to acting instead of singing.

And then there are the problems with the plot and characters. The ending of the movie was more abrupt than Rene Zelwegger's breakup with Kenny Chessney, and certain characters that initially are introduced simply for the sake of a gag, such as the maggot that pops out of the bride's eye in those previews, keep coming back unneccessarily.  In all honesty, though animation was a perfect medium for this story, the filmmakers should have considered ditching the family friendly feel of the movie.  If this was done as a film for adults--minus the hidious songs--it would have been hysterical.  Honestly, there need to be more films with jokes about necrophilia or getting a stiff one over a stiff one, and this could have been one of them.

If you are a fan of Tim Burton, do yourself a favor. Take your $10 that you were planning to spend on a ticket to Corpse Bride, go to Blockbuster and rent Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish, and Sleepy Hollow. You'll have a much more enjoyable time.",1133308800,,2767,4.820675105485232
2463307,1,B000CEXEWU,"I LOVED ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" so when I heard that  Tim Burton was making ""The Corpse Bride"" I did not hesitate to go to see the movie in theaters... I left the theater absolutely amazed at how bad one movie could possibly be. What was Mr. Burton thinking?

The characters in this film have no endearing qualities, are rather boring and un-responsive. The music is simply dredful and the acting horrible. How did Mr. Burton get associated with such mindless, pointless dribble is my only question?

The movie takes place in the Victorian age when two people married to enhance the family wealth. A shy geeky looking Johnny Depp must marry a woman he hardly knows. Unable to accept the path that has been choosen he wanders off into a nearby woods praticing his vows and suddenly a corpse appears in a wedding gown. Unknownly he was just wedded to a corpse and is transported underground to deal with the wife that has magets that talk through her eyes and the typical ghosts and goblins. The corpse apparently had been murdered by a man who said he loved her but, really wanted the family money- this betrayal causing her to wait in her wedding dress for someone who would actually love her...

The movie plays out as a melodramatic, clay matic horror come to life. The story is boring and unimiganitive. Possibly one of the worst movies I seen made and made me want to strach my eyes out... this movie was not enjoyed by the kids I saw it with...

But, what I found mainly annoying about the movie was the horrible songs- all animate features have songs but, this one could have gone well without... the songs are horribly written and even veteren stage actor Albert Finney's voice seemed to be irritating. The songs in other words are just about as good as watching a Mary Kate & Ashley sing-along.

This movie is hardly entertaining for the kids or the adults to see... In other words don't rent, don't buy this movie. Instead let this movie die a peaceful death like it should.",1133049600,,1988,4.585915492957747

2463309,5,B000CEXEWU,"Corpse Bride is the Tim Burton movie I've been waiting for.

Since the wild success of The Nightmare Before Christmas in 1993, I'm a little surprised that Tim Burton hasn't made a movie like this sooner.  Corpse Bride is funny, unique, and just an all-around enjoyable film.

This movie tells the story of Victor Van Dolt, a shy young man who's about to be married to Victoria Everglot, a young woman whom he doesn't even know.  Lucky for them, it was love at first sight, but that doesn't prevent Victor from being any more nervous than he already was.  During the practice wedding he flees into the forest, where he accidentally marries the beautiful (but dead) Corpse Bride.  Now, Victor has to find some way to get out of the marriage and back to Victoria.

This movie is such a refreshing break from all the other movies that came out this year.  In my opinion, it is just as good, if not better, than The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Both have scary, Halloweenish sides, but aren't really dark at all.  And (though the rest of my family refuses to believe me), The Nightmare Before Christmas is indeed a Christmas movie, whereas Corpse Bride is more Halloween-oriented (though Halloween isn't mentioned in the movie).

Corpse Bride does have some songs, but not as much as The Nightmare Before Christmas, and not as good either.  However, Corpse Bride is funnier than the latter movie, probably because there's more talking and less singing.  Some humorous parts include a talking maggot that resides within the Corpse Bride, and a parody of the famous scene at the end of Gone with the Wind.

All in all, this is a magnificent piece of work that takes you away from reality for about 78 minutes.  I highly recommend it for people of all ages.",1132617600,,1749,4.669934640522876

2463314,4,B000CEXEWU,"It is difficult to fault any stop animation work, merely because of the sheer effort and time that goes into creating a work like 'Corpse Bride'. It has really paid off in this film, creating yet another engaging, humourous and unique work from the mastermind of Tim Burton. Honestly, a world without the likes of Tim Burton would be a very dull world indeed.

The characters are truly engaging and the visuals are absolutely stunning. I particularly loved the meloncoly image of Victor playing the piano in the gothic mansion, with the little flower atop his piano.

And yet, I think 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' is a better film. The characters, songs and visuals are much more original and endearing. The worlds within Burton's first stop animation are more realised and unique. The animation is far less polished compared to 'Corpse Bride', but this merely adds to the appeal of the work.

In some ways, 'Corpse Bride' feels slightly rushed, and could have done with some more character and plot development. Victor's decision to marry the corpse bride occur very quickly and the end comes around too quickly. Indeed, at merely 1 hour 20 minutes, Burton had the time to develop the work.

2463315,3,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's second film this year is Corpse Bride. His first film this year was his whacky version on Charlie and The Chocolate Factory in which Johnny Depp (upcoming The Libertine, Secret Window) also starred as a the insanely Willy Wonka. In Corpse Bride, Burton and his crew bring back the feel that The Nightmare Before Christmas gave and Corpse Bride hits the bullseye dead on target, enjoyble story with funny moments and some pretty decent songs. Depp voices Victor Von Dort, who is getting married to Victoria (Emily Watson, Red Dragon, Gosford Park) but here's the thing, Victoria's parents are grouchos and at the rehearsle, Victor kinda gets a little nervous, screws it up, so he takes a stroll in the woods and accidently places the ring for Victoria on a finger of a corpse...the corpse girl rises from the ground and she winds up taking Victor underground where there is other dead people. Victor must be dreaming, he wants this not to be real but he isn't imagining this, he actually proposed to his newly Corpse Bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter, Big Fish, Fight Club), who died years ago waiting for the one she was going to marry to come along but he never so, so she waited for him and she wound up a corpse. So, after hearing that Victoria is marrying someone else, Victor decides he should marry Emily but in order for him to do so, he has to drink poison and die himself. So, the ghastly skeletons and deadites walk among the living for the marriage between The Corpse Bride and Victor. Anyway, that's all I'm going to tell you...I don't want to give away the whole movie but for what it was worth, Corpse Bride is bound to be another Tim Burton classic. Also starring the voices of

Richard E. Grant (The Serpent's Kiss, Gosford Park), Albert Finney (Big Fish, Erin Brokovich), Michael Gough (Sleepy Hollow,Batman movies (except Batman Begins) and of couse the lengendary Christopher Lee (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy)",1131840000,,1945,4.720588235294118
2463316,5,B000CEXEWU,"Corpse Bride is a beautifully brilliant stop-motion movie.  Tim Burton once again proves that he can do what we wouldn't dare dream.  We all know and love The Nightmare Before Christmas, Tim's first stop motion movie, and I thought there is no way he can top that, but he proved me wrong.  This movie along with Wallace and Gromit are the top contenders for Best Animated Picture Award.  Here's the story:

A young man Victor (voiced by non other than Johnny Depp), who lives in a small but strict village, is getting maried to Victoria.  His parents are taking direct oppertunity of this occasion, but Victoria's parents think otherwise.  At the wedding, Victor makes it a complete disaster by butchering his lines and setting Victoria's mothers robe on fire.  In this time of panic, he runs away into the forest. There, he practices his lines and puts the ring on a stick.  He says his whole lines, not knowing the stick is the hand of the buried corpse bride (voices perfectly by Helena Bonham Carter).  Now, she thinks that she is Victors wife, and takes him underground to announce the wedding. While down there, we find out that she once lived in the small town, and she was going to get married, but her fionce had murdered her, and back on earth, the same man is planning to marry Victoria, and Victor must stop him.

Right away into the movie you can tell it's Tim Burton because of the dark mood set right of the bat, and the goofy gagworks that Tim usually uses in this movie.  I have one complaint about the DVD, we need a 2 Disk Special Edition that Warner Bros. usually does.",1131753600,,1589,4.5174825174825175
2463317,5,B000CEXEWU,"Visually stunning and curiously endearing 'Corpse Bride' is another proof that traditional stop-motion animations, if given good amount of originality, can be as imaginatie and entertaining as Pixar animations.  (I said 'another' because there is Aardman and its Wallace & Gromit.)  I don't say 'Corpse Bride' is better than 'Nightmare Before Christmas' of which visual and musical innovation is still to be surpassed.  But the fact doesn't change that I enjoyed thoroughly watching 'Corpse Bride' its wry graveyard humor included.

[IT'S A LOVE STORY] Incredible you might think, but 'Corpse Bride' is a love story, which involves three characters -- Victor, Victoria, and ""Corpse Bride.""  Victor is to marry Victoria he never met because his parents want status, and her parents need money.  This is a typically melodramatic situation, but a clever twist is given.  It turns out that Victoria is a nice girl, with whom Victor fell in love at first sight.

But because of the ill-judged rehearsal of his wedding vow, Victor gives his ring to a wrong woman, who is actually dead and buried in the dark forest.  She is the Corpse Bride, who gleefully brings the bridegroom to her hometown in the land of the dead, where the dead people are leading much, much joyful life.  And a dead dog too.

Few people can think of such an idea, and fewer people are talented enough to realize this macbre idea.  Tim Burton and Mike Johnson did this job brilliantly, with so much visual delight and occasional wry humor.  Voice cast is also perfect, including Johnny Depp (as Victor who uncannily resembles Depp), Helena Bonham Carter (as Corpse Bride), Emily Watson (as Victoria).  You can hear the voice of Albert Finney, Tracy Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Richard E. Grant, Jane Horrocks, and of course, Danny Elfman who also provided the score for the film.  And Burton's favorite actors legendary Christopher Lee and Michael Gough are also to be heard.  What a cast!

I do not say 'Corpse Bride' is perfect.  You might disagree with me, but Danny Elfman's music is not as impressive as that of 'Nightmare' and some part of the film is CGI-processed, which might have lessened the charms of the traditional stop-motion animation.  CGIs often make everything too smooth for me, and usually, much beloved Ray Harryhausen animation is not associated with too smooth movement.  That's why we use this self-contradictory phrase, stop-motion.

Probably this is part of Tim Burton's vast world of imagination when he was a boy, which later produced 'Frankenweenie.'  It was 21 years ago, and Burton has got older since then, but 'Corpse Bride' shows that he has not lost his imagination.",1131580800,,2680,5.002257336343115
2463318,4,B000CEXEWU,"I have been a fan of Tim Burton's work for sometime now. His last foray into stop-animation was with the classic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". I loved the unique animation and the delightful storyline. I was hoping that Tim would capture that same magic again. I was not disappointed with his latest foray into animation ""Corpse Bride"".

Tim Burton brings together a dazzling cast of actors some of which he has worked with in the past like Johnny Depp (""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""), Helena Bonham Carter (""Big Fish""), and Albert Finney (""Big Fish""). Johnny is the voice over for the protagonist of the film Victor Van Dort. His parents (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) had set Victor up to be married to Victoria (Emily Watson), the daughter of the high society couple Everglots who are now penniless. On the day of the wedding rehearsal, Victor is so nervous that he cannot recite his vows correctly and is sent away by the pastor. Victor ends up in a forest and unwittingly says his vows correctly and winds up being the husband of a corpse bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). During his absence a mysterious man named Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) makes a play for Victoria.

What first attracted me to this film is the animation. I loved the shape of the characters' facial features and their pasty white skin. I especially liked the color of Emily's blue hair. I also loved the design of the skeletonal characters. The deep rich dark hues of the settings was visually pleasing to this viewer's eyes.

I personally like the storyline very engaging. This film turned out that it isn't scary. It is very whimsical. The few flaws to this film is: a) too many musical numbers. Some worked, some didn't. I found a few quite annoying and to be a big detriment to the film. What worked the best was the simple piano score that had the most impact on me. And b)the attempts at humor were half-hearted at best. It is either going to be a comedy or isn't. For all its flaws, ""Corpse Bride"" was whimsical escape for me from reality. To put it simply, I loved it.",1131408000,,2121,4.680965147453083
2463319,3,B000CEXEWU,"This is quite a film. I appreciate the difficulty of doing stop-motion, and find it a refreshing change from all the humdrum CG and anime.  Additionally, Danny Elfman's music is a classic in its own right.  Victor's piano solo is a marvelous composition; vintage Elfman with a bouquet of Oingo Boingo.

This film is a Victorian re-tweaking of the legends of Orpheus and Bluebeard.  I appreciate the fresh reinvention and adaptation-and occasional inversion-of classic mythological themes.  The story seems familiar-and clich&eacute; at times-but the changes and inversion of these archetypal themes are what keeps you interested.  Burton would do Joseph Campbell proud.

This film has its moments.  Themes of self sacrifice on the part of both Victor and Emily move this movie from comedy-horror to legitimate art.  Victoria is no wallflower, and is a stock of courage. But there are also elements that overshadow these supernal moments.

One is the legitimacy of Victor and Emily's marriage. It was clearly accident and unintentional.  Any ethicist would maintain that said marriage was not willfully entered into, and therefore null and void.  Furthermore, it was not solemnized by any outside authority, so it feels more like an elopement.  Also, there is the question of his prior engagement to Victoria, which would invalidate any obligation he had to Emily.

Another was the absence of love in the story. We have kindness, compassion, concern, duty, and even pure charity. But romantic love is, except for when Emily and Victory play the piano, is utterly absent.  There is this heart shaped hole in the middle of the quasi-romantic comedy.

One odd aspect of the film was the jibes and jabs at Victorian chastity-personified by two of the lead characters, Victor and Victoria (no relation to the Broadway Play). Since we are 10 years post Britney Spears, I am reminded about C. S. Lewis's comment about people who run around with fire extinguishers in the time of floods.

Additionally, all the living Victorian characters are clich&eacute;s: the Van Dorts, Everglots, and Bluebeard Bittern were as predictable as a lunar orbit.  Pastor Galswell is watery.  This makes the first ten minutes of the film feel like a rerun.

Further, there is an odd sexualization of death.  Emily is more buxom and voluptuous than Victoria as seen by her lips and the cut of her dress.  The tweaking of color is also an obvious hint, especially for those who suffered through ""Pleasentville.""

The humor is mostly visual gags, along the line of Chilled Monkey Brains from ""Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom,"" so you do not feel intellectually satisfied as you would with a British sit com.  However, there are some funny gags:  the Haryhausen piano refers to Ray Harryhausen, famous for his skeletons in ""Jason and the Argonauts.""  You see parodies of Napoleon, Kaiser Wilhelm, Ray Charles, and Peter Lorre (as twisted Jiminy Cricket).  Also, Oingo Boingo was famous for its large skeletons in sombreros.  Once again, these do not full, but they are fun to look for.

SPOILER:

The ending was a downer.  We have resolutions for Victor, Victoria, and Barker, but Emily just vaporizes.  Has she gone back to the Netherworld?  Or has she dissolved into the Cosmic All?  And is annihilation a suitable resolution for a noble person?

This film's greatest asset is its message of self sacrifice in the name of love.  If you scan see past all the side images, it makes it worth the viewing.",1130544000,,3476,4.994773519163763
2463320,4,B000CEXEWU,"Corpse Bride is magical and simplistic. Burton has invented another dark and humerous world, filmed with song and dance. The figurines are well made and beautiful.

2463321,5,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton creates a stunning masterpiece that keeps all the parameters typical in his productions. Combining the macabre and childish elements with stop motion animation techniques, Burton gives life to a fantastic story, just as he did in 1993 with the superb Nightmare before Christmas.

The store serves the director as an excuse to build yet another visual fantasy, supported by the voices of several of his favorite actors: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Albert Finney and Christopher Lee.

The ironic and funny style of Burton portraying death repeats itself, forming and obscure and complex world. The principal characters are no other but a dead bride, a colorful number of skeletons, some monsters and a shy and repressed young man.

The plot of The Corpse's Bride is based on a traditional Ukrainian tale about a girl murdered on her weeding day and waiting since then for her true love.

In a Victorian England village lives Victor van Dort, a melancholic young man pressed by his wealthy but uneducated family to engage to a broken but aristocrat young woman named Victoria Everglot, whose parents despise the Van Dorts but want to solve their economical problems with this convenience marriage.

During a wedding rehearsal at the Everglot's house, Victor goes out to practice his vows, and accidentally says the words on a dead bride's tomb, who has been expecting since her dead for her true love to say the words that magically will free her to be happily ever after.

From that point, Victor goes on a journey in the land of the dead with his new bride. Down there everything seems more fun and colorful that ""up there"", where the world of the living is, on the contrary, almost colorless, with and aesthetic close to whites and blacks, keeping the stiffness and conservative style of the Victorian Ages.

Although the title suggests otherwise, The Corpse's Bride is a sweet and sour love story with a poetic capacity very suggestive and dreamy. True to his provoking spirit, Burton bets on surprising us, letting his usual black humor to disperse over an oppressive atmosphere while the emotional theme of the film, the loss of love, is told like a musical comedy.",1130112000,,2186,4.923913043478261
2463322,5,B000CEXEWU,"It seems to me that everyone who went and saw this movie (or at least everyone that reviewed it) expected another ""Nightmare Before Christmas"". Just because both films are stop-motion doesn't mean that they're going to be similar! Don't get me wrong, I adore ""Nightmare"", but I love ""Corpse Bride"" just as much...or more!

The film begins with the Van Dorts taking their son, Victor, to rehearsal for his arranged wedding to miss Victoria Everglot. Victor, reluctant at first, because somewhat frazzled upon meeting his new bride-to-be. This causes him to lose focus, upsetting the priest when he can't get his vows right. In a nervous panic he flees, although not before accidentally setting Mrs. Everglot on fire. Running into the creepy forest you can expect from Burton, Victor takes out the ring and practices his wedding vows on gnarled old tree. He says them perfectly, but when he puts the ring on a ""branch"", it springs to life, revealing itself to be the blue bueaty, Emily, more commonly known as the Corpse Bride. She takes him down below, to her home, the land of the dead, declaring she is now his wife. Up above, things aren't going so well for Victoria, either. A Lord Barkis Bittern has, in Victor's absence, decided to make a play for Miss Everglot's hand. However, unbeknownst to everyone else, Lord Barkis has a dark and evil secret.

The film centres around Victor trying to set things right and return to his Victoria. This film is absolutely beautiful in appearance, with a lovely score by, who else?, Danny Elfman. It also includes four songs; ""According to Plan"" (Mr. & Mrs. Van Dort, Mr. & Mrs. Everglot), ""Remains of the Day"" (Bonejangles, skeleton chorus), ""Tears to Shed"" (Emily, worm, black widow), and ""The Wedding Song"" (residents of the land of the dead).

There are two characters added in mainly for cimc relief; the Worm that lives in Emily's head, which resembles in voice and appearance the famed acotr, Peter Lorre, and Bonejangles, a delightful skeleton voiced by Danny Elfman.

Speaking of characters, don't expect to see too much of the Skeleton girl and boy, or of Scraps (the dog). They're not very important characters, despite what the trailers and Hot Topic may lead you to believe.

This film is, for the most part, a romantic drama. with a few moments of humour. This seems to upset some people, but I think it works rather well. Of course, there are very corny jokes at times (""Oh, it takes my breath away! ...Well, it would if I had any!"") but for the most part, it balances it out very well. The little jokes spirnkled throughout make it rather enjoyable, while if it were 100% drama, it would be a little harder for some audiences to sit through, being that it IS animated.

Going back to the music. The songs are few and far between, but very good.

~""According to Plan"" is kind of cute, but it will get stuck in your head for ages!

~""Remains of the Day"" is quite probably the most delightful of the songs, full of energy and colour as it tells Emily's sad story. Many people find this song hard to sit through, as it ""doesn't seem to go with the rest of the film"". Keep in mind, however, that it is the land of the dead, so it is not supposed to fit in with the Gothic/Victorian 'living' world.

~The most beautiful song is ""Tears to Shed"", in which the Worm and the Black Widow make an attempt to comfort Emily after she finds that Victor never intended to marry her, with Helena Bonham Carter lending her vocals to sing Emily's sorrowful chorus.

~The least enjoyable song would have to be ""The Wedding Song"". It just seems like it could've been better, done more.

Burton's inspiration came from an old Russian floktale, and I personally think he spun the old tale into a new masterpiece. I would recommend this film to just about anyone...just don't expect another ""Nightmare Before Christmas""!",1129593600,,3854,4.6779911373707534

But it is better then the ""Peach"" movie, and it is a fairly strong movie.

LIKED

1. The animation looks great. The charactors movements are fluid, the production design top notch, the whole vibe spot on.

2. All the voice over talent, from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter to Emily Watson and Albery Finney do excellent jobs with their charactors.

3. I liked how all three leads where likeable. However the film ended I would've been satisfied.

4. I liked that they kept the movie under ninty minutes. When it seems that every single flick nowadays, from good (""Wedding Crashers"" and ""40 Year Old  Virgin"" were both good movies, but both were twenty minutes too long) to bad(""The Devil's Rejects"" was about one hundred and ninty six minutes too long) seem to go on, the films quick, easy pace was nice.

DISLIKED:

1. Let's just be honest here: the songs here sucked. Sure the one with the skelton jazz band LOOKED cool, but can you hum the tune for me now? I don't think so. Everytime I heard the orchestra swell my heart dropped slightly. No wonder they used the score fron ""Nightmare"" in the T.V. adds.

2. The story as whole could have used one more go round in the script department.

But let's be honest here? The songs only take up about ten minutes, and the script isn't awful, just a little more story may have been nice, but these complaints are pretty small. overall, ""Corpse Bride"" is a helluva good time for the whole family.",1129420800,,1942,4.567723342939481
2463324,4,B000CEXEWU,"Unfortunately, though comics retailer sources have the DVD being released late January, '06, they say it's to be a single disc (bad), widescreen only (good by me) with few extras (very bad. Speculation is that there will probably be a special edition later.  I can wait - just like I am waiting after the ""Kill Bill"" to put it out as it should have been issued with both/added scenes, outtakes, etc. etc. and for the real DVD of Sin City (and that is about to be released).  The Corpse Bride I saw fit together well, had appropriate characters for its' story, used flat and bright colors well to demonstrate visually the differences between the world (culture) above and that below (below informal, friendly, outgoing, sharing-----above mostly formal, unfriendly/unaccepting, inward looking, greedy).  Characters were well designed and, where intended, appealing.  The pre-wedding arrival of the dead served to bring out happiness in many of the living.  I'm surely glad Dickens (to pick only one) didn't know you had to choose between humor and drama (think Mr. Micawber as corpse and Uriah Heep as living) when you are trying to entertain - I seem to recall he often used both to good effect in many of his works.  And, I agree that parts of the dead songs were not intelligible but otherwise I found them quite entertaining (though I look forward to an SE DVD with cleaned up sound) and fitting for their environment.

2463325,3,B000CEXEWU,"1993's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" was a milestone in cinematic history: the first full-length claymation film. And oh, what a glorious film it was! Bursting at the seems with twisted, beautiful, and vividly imaginative imagery thanks to creator Tim Burton and wonderfully catchy and quirky musical numbers thanks to composer Danny Elfman.

Needless to say, Tim Burton's return to claymation was long awaited for me and many others. In 2005, it finally happened with ""Corpse Bride"". Everything I had seen in the previews looked absolutely fantastic, and I had some very high hopes for the film.

The plot is as follows: Victor (Depp) is a very shy but very spirited young man living in a dreary city populated by stuck-up rich snobs who care about nothing other than money, rules, and manners. He is set up by his parents to marry a young girl named Victoria (Watson), who is, of course, the one other free spirit in the city. Due to an unfortunate series of events, Victor accidentally marries a dead bride (Bonham Carter) and is consequently sucked into the land of the dead. He then attempts to sort out this misunderstanding and get back to the world of the living.

The potential is vast, but the film does little to utilize it. On top of the storyline being crazily predictable, the characters, as you can probably already tell, are paper thin and horribly clichd. The story has some great opportunities for hilarious macabre gags, which the film obviously tries to harness, but unfortunately, they all end up being painfully corny. Also, the musical numbers, unlike in ""Nightmare"", feel forced and unnecessary, as if Burton threw them in just because he felt he had to. There is just no energy or passion in them. The animation, though technically better, is also far inferior to ""Nightmare"" in terms of fluidity and visual passion. But the biggest problem with the film is that it should clearly be a heavily aesthetic experience, and the visuals are, quite frankly, underwhelming, unlike most of Burton's previous films, which contain more than their fair share of bravura images.

Also, the film seemed very short and ended very abruptly, even though it seemed to drag for the majority of the running time.

The major redeeming feature of the film, however, is Burton's very interesting contrast between the land of the dead and the world of the living. The dead inhabit a fun, friendly, colorful place where song and dance are encouraged, as apposed to the living, whose world is cold, dreary, desolate, dull, and, ironically, dead. Who are the ones that are truly alive in this situation?

2463326,2,B000CEXEWU,"I saw THE CORPSE BRIDE this evening. I thought it was an absolute -chore- to sit through.

Visually it's nice... at times. The character design is uneven, but the Corpse Bride herself is sometimes quite beautiful on screen.

Storywise, it's just dreadful. Slow. Predictable. Not funny. Plus there are a number of garish song and dance numbers which are not entertaining.

For all the time and effort put into this type of production, they should've made sure the story was charming and compelling. It was just a bore.

Keep in mind, I also think NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS is slow and boring. Visually, I give CORPSE BRIDE 4 stars. Story gets only one.

PS - It's funny how readers give ""no votes"" to negative reviews. But all the ""no votes"" don't make this movie any better.",1129161600,,775,4.711111111111111
2463327,3,B000CEXEWU,"There's a lot to like in this film.  Technically it is a marvel.  As I watched it, every so often I was simply struck anew by how much work went into it.  Each movement carefully executed by hand, so that the little ""stick figures"" spring to life.  The attention and craftsmanship is staggering...not a word I use very often.

There are many lovely, artistic images as well.  My favorite was a scene near the end when the Corpse Bride stands in a doorway, and her long gown slowly turns into a cloud of butterflies.  It was a delicate and lovely moment...showing a true flight of imaginative fancy.

But there are too many things not to like.  The story is pedestrian.  None of the characters are very engaging.  And even at around 80 minutes, the film was too long.  The plot is too slight, and it is padded by some mediocre (and poorly sound-edited) Danny Elfman tunes.  Elfman is trying yet again to evoke the Teutonic bombast of  Kurt Weill (Threepenny Opera, ""Mack the Knife"") but his music sounds the same from movie to movie.  I like that Tim Burton has his group of collaborators (like Johnny Depp or Helena Bonham Carter), but it's time to dump Elfman.  His best stuff is still Oingo Boingo and the theme to The Simpsons.  After Batman, I think he stopped actually writing anything original.

I see at least 100 movies per year in the theaters, and another 100 or so on DVD / television.  About once every two years or so, a movie literally makes me doze off.  THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES did that to me.  And now, shockingly, THE CORPSE BRIDE has done it.  I lost about 5 minutes due to a little nap I took.

My problem with many Burton movies is that they lack a heart.  Not that he doesn't want the movies to have heart, but somehow he seems to direct away from honest emotion.  Either the story is too boring to generate interest (as here) [and yes, I know he didn't technically direct this film, but let's face it...the product is his], or the plot becomes too muddled with messages to drive home an emotional climax (BIG FISH) or the film is simply too sloppy for any real emotional impact (BATMAN RETURNS).  His best movies generate real feeling from the audience DESPITE Burton, usually because his performers give him the heart he can't seem to find...he's too busy dazzling us with his visual virtuosity to simply stay put and let us OBSERVE humans in action.  EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, PEE WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE and even WILLY WONKA makes us care because their lead performers are either subtle enough (Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore) or childlike enough (Johnny Depp, Paul Reubens) to draw a response from the audience.  Other movies, like ED WOOD, are a treat because Burton obviously has an affection for the odd and strange in people, and ED WOOD is truly populated by the odd and strange.  But again, to me CORPSE BRIDE left me quite cold (no pun intended).

Based on the reaction of the kids who were in the audience with me, this movie doesn't have enough slapstick and mischief to engage the little ones.  It doesn't have emotional impact enough to engage adults.  And teens, who love Johnny Depp, soon realize that his voice alone does not a Johnny Depp film make!

Because of the lovely artisanship, I can't totally condemn the film.  And it does have a terrific voice cast.  But I cannot recommend it either.  A big disappointment.",1128902400,,3349,4.597972972972973
2463328,5,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's mind must be a very strange place.  Remember, it's where if you commit suicide you have to work for social services in the afterlife (Ref:  Beetlejuice).  I'm a social worker, so I know what that means!  Men with hands made of scissors,  Jack Nicholson as Batman's foil...this is one sick puppy of a director.

So when you hear Mr. Burton is directing a film based on an Eastern European folktale in which one of the heroines-the heroines, mind you---is a corpse....well, family fare is not what comes to mind.

And, although it's animated, Corpse Bride definitely is not for the younger set, 9 or so and below.  These characters look creepy.  The title character has a habit of losing her eye and talking to the maggot, Louie, who lives behind it.  Skeletons of dogs and people walk and talk about in the ""underworld"".

However, like Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands, older children will find the animations amusing and fascinating; and parents will be pleased with the messages packaged in the film.

Briefly, ""Corpse Bride"" is an animated operetta in which Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp), son of fishmongers, is engaged to Victoria, (Emily Watson) the daughter of nobles who are now penniless.  Neither know each other but meet accidentally and fall in love.  When Victor stumbles over his complicated wedding vows at the rehearsal, he's humiliated by a stranger at the wedding (Richard E. Grant) and walks in the woods to practice.  When he says the vows, he places the ring on a ""twig"" that turns out to be the finger of Emily (Helena Bonham-Carter), the Corpse Bride, who of course jumps up and happily informs him they are married.  (She's very pretty, by the way, dead or not).

Much of the rest of the movie is taken up by Victor trying to figure out how to get out from the Underworld and by Emily trying to either deny he's doing that or actively convince him to stay.  Gradually, however, Victor finds, to his surprise, that he is falling in love with Emily.

In the end the viewers have heard some good lessons about love, and the main characters, primarily Emily and Victor, have each been willing to sacrifice greatly for the other, out of their love for each other.  The importance of wedding vows is a central theme, and Victor especially gives long thought to whom his alliances lie, given what he's promised, and to whom.  And those motivated by greed, such as Richard Grant's character, mostly come out empty handed.

The comedy is brilliant.  In one scene, Emily's friends in the ""pub"" do a number quite reminiscent of the Star Wars cantina scene, given the odd-looking musicians. I'm not sure how well the ""operetta"" mode works with animation; while claymation gives these characters terrific means of expression, they are still limited in their ability to emote, and musical theatre may be best left to human faces.  Still, Danny Elfman's score is beautiful as always.

Leave the wee ones with the other parent next door at ""March of the Penguins"" or ""Wallace and Gromit:  Search for the Were-Rabbit"", then huddle with the rest of the kids  to see this wonderful film.",1128816000,,3107,4.780487804878049
2463329,4,B000CEXEWU,"Recently we went to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. It's a stop-motion animation flick, similar to The Nightmare Before Christmas.

It's thoroughly entertaining, great family fare. The only knocks I have against it are its length--it is short--and it has a pretty linear and predictable plot. The voice actors turn in good performances. Danny Elfman does a great job, as always, with the music. The movie features a great colour scheme, evoking a grey, Victorian style in the land of the living, and a more colourful land of the dead.

It's a great family film, as I said. However, it could be scary for very young kids. Kids under 5 shouldn't be at the movies anyways.",1128643200,,668,4.75
2463330,3,B000CEXEWU,"... But then again, maybe its a marriage of both, and a good one at that (no pun intended) ; and speaking of pun - tis a coincidence that I site a pun from Tim Burton's previous flick (and along mentioned on my review for -> ) his rendition of Roald Dahl's Charlie and The Chocolate Factory... whence this one comes with a lot of it.

Casting Helena Bonham Carter again, and Burton's regular Johnny Depp since his most brilliant work Edward Scissorhands, doing the voice of the characters -- Depp voices a decent clutzy named Victor who is set up to marry a girl named Victoria from an alleged prestigeous family ... it so happens that when reciting by himself the marriage vows that he can't get right during practices for the wedding, it drawn a dead bride named Emilie (which coincidentally is the similar name to a character on that brilliant book I'm currently reading THE JESTER (ooh, synchronicities!)), that pitt our character down into the underworld.

Depp's character then found a time to reach his living wife-to- be Victoria and made her aware about what had happened, only that it turned out her parents are now setting her up for a marriage to Barkis Bittern who is believed to be of nobel birth. My hunches came that the guy had to do with Emilie (yep, the other dead bride chick)'s current condition - and oh yeah, the bloak had to drink from the cup.

Incidentally surfing Amazon, I stumbled upon that flick VICTOR VICTORIA, whence comes one of the side-pun from Burton in this feature flick, and there's more of that from where it came from.

Another movie in the stop-motion format (which differs from Claymation, being that it incorporates creatures made out of clay - whilst this use modules and puppets - although processed in similar methods) coming out from Tim Burton since THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS, and JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH (another adapted from Roald Dahl)- there are just some things that you can't put your finger on for Burton's works that gives you the feeling that it could've been better somehow.

And one more thing- we have Danny Elfman providing the musical works on this one again, take note on some of the worthwhile bits on the piano pieces incorporated on the flick though.

If you liked any of these films, you should see Corpse Bride. If you get offended by jokes about heaven, hell, church, and life after death, than maybe this movie is not for you.

If you know wh oTim Burton is and like his work, you MUST see this. It is not his best but, it definatly won't dissapoint!",1128211200,,778,4.686131386861314
2463333,4,B000CEXEWU,"My wife is a big fan of Johnny Depp and The Nightmare Before Christmas, so I knew we were going to see this movie as soon as it came out.  When she described the plot to me, I said, ""sounds like a Russian fairytale."" To which she replied, ""you're scary.""  Corpse Bride is indeed loosely based on a Russian fairytale.

The reason the plot made me think of Russian fairytales is because the concept of death and ghosts in Russian myth is more akin to fairies and fairyland than traditional European purgatory. Ghosts can lead a rich existence in the afterlife, including marriage.  This concept might be a bit difficult to grasp for American audiences, but Corpse Bride mixes belief systems anyway so it's not that critical to the enjoyment of the film.

Basically, Victor Van Dort (Depp) is to be married to Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson).  Victor is the son of a successful fishmonger, and thus has plenty of money but no status.  The upcoming bourgeois class, so to speak. Conversely, Victoria comes from an impoverished noble class.  The marriage is one of necessity, and yet the two find they love each other anyway.

It's all very quaint.  Into this mess steps two sinister characters: the Corpse Bride herself (Helena Bonham Carter) who is rather lusciously sculpted, and Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant), a male black widow of sorts who marries women for their dowries.  Barkis is apparently a complete idiot, as he can't seem to recognize that the Everglots are dirt poor, even though the family bemoans this situation at every corner.  And oh yeah, their mansion is a dirty mess.

After a disastrous wedding rehearsal (with Christopher Lee lending his deep baritone of disapproval to Pastor Galswells), Victor wanders off into the forest to rehearse his lines.  He rehearses them on what he thinks is a tree, only to accidentally propose to the Corpse Bride herself.  In no time, she whisks him away to the Neitherworld-oh wait, sorry, wrong movie-to the underworld.  Or somewhere that dead people go.

One might be led to believe that this is the place where ghosts go, but it doesn't seem like it.  If anything, the dead seem to have a much more enjoyable time than the living.  It has a very Mexican Day of the Dead feel to it, with a lot more color than the black and grays that color the living world. Everyone in this strange underworld is a walking punch line (the chef is just a head...the head chef. Get it?!). After much wrangling, Victor convinces his new bride to visit the living to meet his parents.  This takes a good ten minutes of dialogue and preparation.

After his return, Victor resigns himself to marrying the Corpse Bride.  But there's a catch: he has to really be dead to marry her.  So Victor decides to give up the ghost, so to speak.  The dead then march off to the living world and hilarity ensues.  Which is strange, since it was so difficult the first time to get Victor and his Corpse Bride up to the surface the first time around.

Corpse Bride is a lot like that.  It sets up a rule and then gets bored with it.  The conclusion is satisfying, although a little trite.  Without giving the rest of the plot away, the question of whether the dead are undead...or just dead and loving it, is never really answered.  In typical Burton fashion, the movie blithely moves along without worrying too much about logic.

In that regard Corpse Bride is a lot of fun.  The characters are perfect parodies of Victorian-era archetypes.  The living world has the feel of a Gormenghast novel, which is undeniably depressing, claustrophobic, and very, very British.  There aren't enough musical sequences, but the ones that do pop up are amusing.  Unfortunately, some of the musical themes recur throughout the film (specifically, ""according to plan""), but the characters sing so infrequently that you forget what they're referencing.

There are horror homages too.  With Burton, there always are: the Corpse Bride has a maggot (Enn Reitel) in her head that sounds like Peter Lorre.  It gets old fast.  The piano is a Harryhausen, named after the famous stop-motion animator, Ray Harryhausen.

It's also not nearly as charming as The Nightmare Before Christmas.  The animation is superb, but that doesn't mean much in a world of CGI and well, Burton's other films.  You won't be humming any of the tunes afterwards and the characters aren't fleshed out enough to care all that much.  Heck, the villain doesn't even have a good theme song!

If your kids want to see something Halloween-ish, this is just the movie for them.  While Corpse Bride is cute, it is not necessarily for young children.  There are a lot of dismembered organs moving about (most gruesomely, a fellow who splits himself in two, pulsing organs and all), along with a lot of dead bodies.  Adults might be a bit bored, as the plot is fairly linear.

Ultimately, Burton can't top The Nightmare Before Christmas, which has now attained a form of cult status.  The Corpse Bride fairytale can be told in a couple of paragraphs, and it doesn't translate as well onto film the way, say, Beauty and the Beast did.",1128211200,,5101,4.729024943310658

2463335,5,B000CEXEWU,"Like all the reviews mention, this is not to be looked upon as the follow-up to Tim Burton's classic 1993 ""Nightmare Before Christmas"". While that film was a hilarious Gothic comedy expressing Burton's take on the commercialized ""horror"" of Christmas, 2005's Corpse Bride is a visually stunning, short conflict drama with innovative cinematography and computer graphics. Johnny Depp stars as the reluctant groom Victor Van Dort, Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse are his parents, nouveauriche and bourgeois fishmongers who want to buy their way into high society through a marital union between Victor and Victoria Everglot (Emily Watson)whose wealthy ""old money"" parents are stereotypical Victorian folk- pretentious, snobbish and fastidious about etiquette and propriety. Helene Bonham Carter stars as titular Corpise Bride and Danny Elfman himself makes an apperance as a Singing Skeleton. The animation is wondrous to behold and the details are superb. As already mentioned, the look of this film evokes other styles- Charles Addams' The Addams Family, Tim Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas "" (especially in Victor's dead skeletal dog and in various other skeletal creatures) and a little bit of Beetlejuice. The Gothic drama is even reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe tales. In fact, the plot is supposedly lifted from an old, obscure 19th century Russian folk tale. There have been other ""corpse bride"" stories, even found in German author Henrich Heine's ""Giselle"" and in older Mexican folk tales. Part of the charm of this film is that it is slightly necrophiliac, though never explicitly so, especially in the creation of the Corpse Bride, who is eerily beautiful. She is played well by Helena Bonham Carter but at times I felt that she was a tad like Calista Flockheart (and that's no joke or offense to her nearly skeletal body). Johnny Depp has worked with Tim Burton before and it shows. As Victor he is shy, unassuming but a romantic, solitary figure. The music and songs are not as catchy as the ones in ""Nightmare Before Xmas"" but they are dramatically compelling. This is a great film and highly enjoyable. Don't let the other reviews who criticize and slice up the details too much. Enjoy it for a short drama that is based on the dark conflict of a young man who must choose between a living bride or a dead one. The look of the film and the story is really the real attraction, for the comedy is subdued. However, I felt that the resolution to the film, especially the demise of the Corpse Bride, or her ""freedom"" from the spell, was very rushed and unfulfilling. Why couldn't she just return to the Underworld ? The visual details are glorious. The claymation is harldy used and they appear more as advanced computer graphics whose vivid personalities are not forced and seem natural, especially in the fluidity of Corpse Bride's movements and in the expressions of the dead folk. It is interesting to note how the dour and cold Victorians are made fun of. They are supposedly living but their white, pale faces and boring lifestyles lack the spontaneity and merriment of the more animated dead beings in the Underworld. They are as other mentioned figures from Dia De Los Muertos, the Mexican equivalent of Halloween (Day of the Dead). This is a fun movie and there is nothing offensive or vulgar about it. It is witty drama with a few moments of comedy and parody.",1128124800,,3386,4.952548330404218
2463336,5,B000CEXEWU,"""Can a heart still break once it's stopped beating?"" This, said by the evilly delicious Lord Barkis (without giving anything else about his character), sums up this entire visual fest. The amazing puppetry involved in this film, coupled with the vibrant songs, make this pure, good, true entertainment. The story is set in drab Victorian England, where Victor's (Johnny Depp) parents are now rich commoners whereas Victoria's (Emily Watson) parents are broke aristocracy. Well, I say, Victor, Victoria, and Victorian! What a coincidence! Victor and Victoria's marriage is disrupted first by Victor's sudden anxiety, and later threatened by both the arrival of the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter), and the devilish Lord Barkis (Richard E. Grant), both of whom trouble the impending marriage in various ways. The story, without being overly sophisticated, also isn't overly complicated, which is good since such complication could detract from the main story line. Tim Burton and his crew have created an amazing world here with their brilliant and ingenious minds. This is also what is amazing about the story; the fact that Victorian England is portrayed as dry and boring, where the Land of the Dead is portrayed as a very colorful and fun world, demonstrating Burton's ""warped"" view of the world and death. However ""warped"" it may be though, this film is a feast for the eyes, and its morbid setting should actually not scare many young kids (though all kids are different) because while the setting may be somewhat scary, the content itself is not, and one heck of a ride at that.",1128038400,,1587,5.084291187739463

The story of how Victor becomes engaged to Emily the Corpse Bride has already been well-told in the reviews, so I will not provide needless details.  Tim Burton does a wonderful job in making the Land of the Dead an interesting place filled with all kinds of intriguing characters, more so than are among the living.  The living are drab and colorless while being dead is where the place is jumping. One of more comic ones in the Head Waiter existing only as a head carried around by a troop of roaches (being French he is an obvious victim of the guillotine).  The Maggot (voiced by Enn Reitel) does a nice Peter Lorrie imitation and provides humorous commentary.  There also is an odd couple in the tall mustached general and the short General Bonesapart (voiced by Deep Roy).

The voices for the characters are truly excellent and I cannot recall a movie that had so many famous actors doings so many voices.  Johnny Depp is great as the meek Victor who gradually builds his own courage and Helena Bonham Carter is marvelous as the Emily Corpse Bride but there are great voices among the supporting cast.  Christopher Lee is at his sinister best as Pastor Galswell; Richard E. Grant adds a sinister elegance to Barkis Bittern and Michael Gough makes a very good wise old skeleton of Elder Gutknecht.  Emily Watson is quite excellent as the blushing Victoria and Albert Finny is memorable as Victoria's father, dejected over having a fishmonger for a son-in-law.

I think that Corpse Bride in the kind of movie that one has to see more than once to get a full appreciation.  Initially, the viewer is expecting to see a film that is close to The Nightmare Before Christmas (certainly hard to better) and is disappointed that Corpse Bride does not meet that expectation.  However, you will find that the newcomer is imbued with Tim Burton's sense of the macabre and is great fun. Corpse Bride is a different style of storytelling; beautifully atmospheric and memorable that is pure Tim Burton.",1127692800,,2685,4.779220779220779
2463342,5,B000CEXEWU,"Okay- My biggest worry when entering the theater was that I would be so worried about how this movie would measure up to ""the Nightmare Before Christmas""- you can't read a review for this film that doesn't mention it, and there are few that don't compare it-

Luckily for me- I was able to put my worries aside and other than a few parts (mostly the music) I was able to enjoy the movie for what it offered.

The story is very different , and visually it's amazing- but the most amazing thing is Johnny Depp- who did the best non Johnny Depp act I've ever seen- I almost forgot it was him- while Joanna Lumly and Tracey Ulman almost snuck by me- (Michael Gough was pretty obvious though- I mean- it looked like him)

I did have a slight problem with some of the character designs though- mostly Victoria's father- and the Vandort family driver- Victoris' Father was a huge ball of a man on toothpick legs- while the driver's face - well- was very reminiscent of - uh- a very specific part of a man's anatomy- well- three different pieces in one location - twig and berries- N-E-Who

The story is about two people - Victor and Victoria,who are to be wed- even though they've never met each other- mainly to benefit the interests of both sets of parents- Victoris's to gain some finances, being that they are now penniless, and Victor's (whom Victoria's Mother calls the Nouveau Riche)- to gain some status in the town after their fish business apprently boomed-

Duting their rehearsal, Victor can't seem to get his voes right and accidently sets his soon to be Mother In Law's dress on fire- he wanders in into the cemetary practicing when he unintentionally speaks his vows and slips the ring onto what he thinks is a tree branch- but turns out to be the waiting hand of the Corpse Bride- who has been waiting for the moment her entire afterlife,(she was murdered while waiting for her love to elope)  and is more than willing to accept- and takes Victor down to the Underworld, where Victor learns that the afterlife isn't as dead as he thinks (it turns out to be much more lively than his own living town)  He starts to develp a love for his new bride, but still yearns to be with his fiancee- whom he has also fallen in love with- to make matters worse, the Mysterious Lord Barkus visits with an agenda all his own- and the movie will keep you guessing to what will happen- which is a nice change from so many romantic comedies that don't really leave much of the ending to the imagination.

The music fares pretty well- Remains of the Day is toe tapping fun, but the best musical pieces are Victor's Solo - and the Piano Duet (between Victor and Emily - the Corpse Bride)- unbelievably beautiful- I wish they were longer!

This is a fantastic movie- and I can't wait to see it again- let alone get it on DVD- and I'm pretty sure that Nightmare fans will love it- and those not so much fans may even enjoy it-

It's no Nightmare, but a beautifully done film- and if it doesn't win this year's animation Oscar- ther is no hope for Cinema-",1127692800,,3041,4.4239713774597496
2463343,5,B000CEXEWU,"If you loved the quirky humor of Burton's movies (Charley and the Chocolate Factory, Nightmare before Xmas etc...) then you'll absolutely love this. The title of the review is a quote from the town crier who is always announcing Viktor's mishaps seconds after they happen. This alone made me laugh aloud and was worth the price of admission.

Corpse bride's setting is initially the land of the living, a drab colorless place, populated by miserable people. After the marriage to the corpse (played perfectly by Helena Bohum Carter), the setting switches to the land of the dead. Full of color and music, it's like a breath of fresh air compared to the 'land above'. Maybe Burton is trying to show that us the living need to be happier while we're here, because unlike the movie where the dead and alive reunite, once we die that's it. Make the most of it while you can.

I highly recommend this to anyone, take your kids to see this and help him or her overcome their fear of death. Seeing as everyone is headed in that direction anyway.",1127692800,,1038,4.605405405405405
2463344,5,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton has become reknowned for his movies about the weird, the macabre, and the very funny. And his new stop-animated masterpiece ""Corpse Bride,"" a host of bizarre characters and a bittersweet love triangle, has all three qualities.

This is an ""underground"" film in the best sense of the word. It gives you the sort of feeling that really expert haunted houses do -- you're enjoying the ghouls and skeletons too much to care who it's aimed at.

Victor (Johnny Depp) is at the rehearsal for his arranged wedding, when he forgets his vows. Not a good omen. He runs out and rehearses it by himself, and ends up slipping the ring on the finger of a dead girl, Emily (Helena Bonham Carter). But Emily, who died tragically, falls in love with Victor and considers herself married to him.

Now Victor is trapped in the underworld, which is a surprisingly cheery, upbeat place when you consider everyone is dead. He tries to find his way back to the world of the living, but soon finds himself more drawn to the tragic Emily. Now he must make the ultimate choice: Will he return (for as long as he lives) to his arranged bride, or stay in the underworld with the Corpse Bride?

You'd think a movie about dead people would be depressing. At the very least, dark. But surprisingly ""Corpse Bride"" is neither -- instead, Burton has crafted a sweet, enchanting little love story where one of the people happens to be dead, and which is set in the underworld. There's nothing frightening about it. If anything, it's enchanting.

Is the plot original? Heck no -- boil it down, and you have a boy-meets-girl story. But it's the delivery that's charming, from the funny dialogue (""Play dead!"") to the colorful inhabitants of the underworld (like the pirate, or the intimidating minister). The macabre humour and song-and-dance numbers add to the charm of this world, where the dead are more alive than the living.

And the voice actors seal the deal; what could have been merely funny becomes touching, in their hands. Johnny Depp brings the timid, tremulous Victor to life, and makes his dilemma believable, while Carter makes us look past protruding bones and bluish skin, to the sweet romantic Emily was. The only problem is that moronic maggot -- it's an annoying distraction.

Coming up with a suitable follow-up for cult classic ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" couldn't have been easy. But Burton does so in rare style, creating a story both hilarious and bittersweet. Enchanting.",1127692800,,2472,4.816037735849057
2463345,2,B000CEXEWU,"The Corpse Bride is the newest movie that Tim Burton worked on and animated through my personal favorite type of animation, which is stop-motion animation.

The movie is about a young man name Victor (Johnny Depp) who has been set up in an arranged marrage by his parents with a young woman named Victoria who lives a few houses away.  They had never met before, but fell in love once Victoria saw Victor playing the piano.  At the wedding rehersal, Victor forgets all of his lines and is yelled at by the preacher (Christopher Lee)that the wedding cannot take place until he is more prepared.  Victor runs out of the wedding rehersal and wanders through the nearby forest trying to remember his lines.  He finally gets it right and using what he thought was a stick in the ground, he places the wedding ring onto the hand of a dead corpse in the ground as he is reciting the lines.  This wakes up the corpse bride, who insists that Victor just married her.  She kisses him, and they are transported to the very lively land of the dead which Victor desprately tries to escape from in order to marry Victoria.  Victor has some adventures down there and eventually returns to the surface followed by all of the residents of the underworld which leads up to the climax of the story, and then the happy, but rather weak ending.

What was wrong with this movie?  Well a lot was actually.  The story itself was lacking to me.  The story wasn't anything that original.  Nightmare Before Christmas's story had it's flaws, but at least it was a new concept.  Everything in this was very used.  Think about how many horror movies include a zombie bride.  Lots.  The characters weren't original looking either.  Victor looked very much like Jack from Nightmare.  He was tall and very thin and always wore a tuxcedo.  Emily (the bride) was an equivilant to Sally in Nightmare.  She had much more meat on her than Victor, even though she should have been more skeleton like since she was dead, and just like Sally, she kept on losing body parts.  I had read somewhere that Disney originally was interested in using Tim Burton's animation for a stop motion animatied version of the Haunted Mansion movie, and even went so far into some pre-production until they decided that they would rather use Eddie Murphy for the Haunted Mansion.  Knowing this going into the Corpse Bride, I was actually suprised at some of the scenes that had some similar features to the actual Disney Haunted Mansion rides.  One example of this is the hallway with all of the portraits of Victoria's family.  The Haunted Mansion ride has a scene a lot like this.  Also, the Haunted Mansion ride's backstory involves a murdered bride and she appears in the attic scene of the rides.  This sort of leaves me to believe that The Corpse Bride is all of the leftover pre production material (everything from the sets to the characters) from The Haunted Mansion movie before Disney dropped them. I actually think if this was the Haunted Mansion movie instead of the Corpse Bride, the end result would have been much better.

Another problem that I had with this movie was the music.  All of the instrumental stuff was great, but when Victor's parents started singing as soon as you were introduced to them, I actually groaned.  I was not expecting a musical, and I found most of the musical parts of the story were misplaced and not used to the movie's advantage.  I personally think that it would have been much more effective to keep the music in the underworld, and not have any musical numbers above ground.

Now that I've gone over the bad, I'll move to the better, and that would be the animation.  The scene with Victor and Emily was amazing how the hands moved so smoothly and accurately on a 6 inch tall puppet that was being moved 24 times for every second.  Scenes like this was the highlights of the best parts of the animation, but other scenes were lacking.  I was expecting all of the animation to be perfect for this movie.  Skelleton Studios (I think I got that right) is tied at the top with Aardman Animation (coming out with a new Wallace and Gromit real soon) on my list of the best Animation studios out there.  I though after almost a decade since James and the Giant Peach, the animation in this movie would be absolutely flawless, but it was far from that.  To me, in certain parts it looked like the animators just got lazy and moved the puppet way too much and left the camera on for way too many frames for each position.  I noticed this especially with Victoria.  I noticed in a few spots she seemed to ""jump"" from one spot to another in a jerky movement (it looked like a stop motion movie I have made!).  Although not perfect, the animation was the best part of the movie, and was amazing enough as it was, but just didn't compare to Nightmare or James and the Giant Peach.

The Corpse Bride could have been much better, but I hope if it is successfull (which it will be without a doubt with the praise it's been getting which I don't get why), then Tim Burton will spend more time on his stop motion films and we will get some more with a better story in less than a decade this time...",1127606400,,5173,4.512352309344791
2463346,5,B000CEXEWU,"Let me begin by saying that this is one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. It's hard to believe it's all stop motion, as it looks every bit ass good as The Incredibles. Burton makes an excellent choice in his color palette. The land of the living is almost entirely done in shades of grey, while the land of the dead usues a much wider range of colors. In fact, one of the major themes in the filmk is how much more lively it is downstairs. It's more colorful, the people are more friendly and the music is better. The trippy, hallucinagenic sequence of ""Remains of the Day"" took my breath away.

As far as the story is concerned, it's a black comedy in the truest sense of the word. What starts out as a very dramatic plot  begins to be sprinkled with dry humor, which increases towards the end. The humor is very old fashioned in nature, rooted firmly in the lost art of the pun. Some may find this corny, but I thought it was refreshing and fit the film perfectly.

The score, by Danny Elfman of course, is in my opinion one of the best he's ever done. And while the songs are just a notch below those of The Nightmare Before Christmas (but only just), the movie as a whole is as good, if not better than its predecessor.",1127606400,,1243,4.236286919831223
2463347,4,B000CEXEWU,"I saw the movie on opening night, and I thought it was pretty great. Of course, the immediate question will be how it compares to Nightmare Before Christmas.  I think that Corpse Bride fails to quite achieve the greatness of Nightmare, which is one of my favorite films of all time, but I'm certainly not saying that it isn't great fun, or a success... it is.  Part of the question may involve the fact that Nightmare was Burton's first and therefore definitive animated movie, and that this one, though certainly not any sort of 'sequel', just by merit of being a similar film in many ways will always seem at least a little inferior in the minds of most.  However, it may be slightly more than that:  this one didn't exactly strike the same magical chord with me as Nightmare (of course I am an older and different person now), but I still liked it a lot.  As some other reviewers have stated, this film also seems fairly short in comparison.  I will say this:  the animation, especially at the beginning, is stunning - crisp and complex, probably more so than with its predecessor, and that in itself is a joy to see.  The colors are very drab in the beginning, as befits the gloomy starkness of the film's mood and its Victorian (ha ha) setting.  Then the film becomes much more colorful in the land of the dead, turning the conventions of death and life around, a very interesting touch, I thought.  It seemed, though, that the sharpness of the images became more blurred later in the movie, with all the colors and more sources of light.  Perhaps this is intentional, or maybe it was just my eyes, but I preferred the crisper animation.  I liked most of the characters a lot (Christopher Lee's character reminds me of the Winter Warlock from ""Here Comes Santa Claus""), but overall didn't find them as endearing as Jack, Sally, the two-faced mayor and company...  At first, I didn't like Emily (the corpse bride herself) so much, but her redemption at the end is more than enough to change one's mind.  The dog (I forget his name) is just as cute as Jack Skellington's Zero.  As for the music, I'll agree with some reviewers that it definitely lacks the very original punch of Elfman's work for Nightmare (one plus however are the touches of harpsichord in the dreary above-ground world - perfect!).  The main song number in the land of the dead seems to come off as a silly imitation of the style of Oogey Boogey as lacking in substance as he was (okay, okay, the bugs do count as something..)  In fact, the music may be the only thing I can put my finger on that I would consider a disappointment in this film, but it's still one worth seeing for anybody (considering, though, that the target audience is really adults, not children, as the themes and images may be considered quite morbid), and a must for Burton fans like myself.  I might add that I absolutely loved Charlie & the C.F. too, and am a big fan of Tim's work, particularly Big Fish, Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood and Batman (Apes is my least favorite of his work).  Despite my constructive criticisms, this one remains a dark and wonderful tale with a life-affirming message.",1127606400,,3140,4.555160142348755
2463348,2,B000CEXEWU,"Before I go into details about what I didn't like in this movie, the characters looked beautiful.

Other than that, most aspects of the movie seemed rushed and sloppy. The stop-motion animation was not nearly as smooth as in The Nightmare Before Christmas(TNBC). The soundtrack was mediocre at best, though there was occassionally interesting background music.

The movie is just over an hour long and it really seems to have a slow storyline. If I could go back in time, I would not go to see Tim Burton's Corpse Bride. As a Burton fan, the movie was simply sub-par. Tim Burton can and has done better work.",1127606400,,608,4.672897196261682
2463357,3,B000CEXEWU,"Okay, first of all, let me start off by saying I'm a huge Tim Burton fan. The Nightmare Before Christmas is one of my favorite movies. I even collect toys from this movie. So, I was really looking forward to seeing Corpse Bride. After seeing commercials for it on TV I got more and more excited to see this movie. However, to my utter surprise, I was left a bit disappointed.

So my husband and I headed out to the theaters (which were deserted for an opening night on a Friday). The beginning scene starts off with the rehearsal of an arranged marriage between Victor (Johnny Depp) and Victoria (Emily Watson). Immediately I am reminiscent of visuals from Nightmare Before Christmas. The characters are exaggeratingly thin or fat, big round expressing eyes, dark and drab atmosphere with moonlit scenery, creepy naked trees, and the obvious influence of Edward Gorey. Both Victor and Victoria are extremely nervous since neither of them has ever even met. When they finally meet for the first time, they're surprised that there are sparks of love between them. However, Victor, still being shy and unable to blurt out his vows correctly, panics and flees from the rehearsal. While in the forest practicing his vows, Victor places his ring on what he thought was a twig. Unfortunately, he instead placed his ring on the boney finger of Emily, the corpse bride (Helenda Bonham Carter). This spirals Victor into a world of trouble in which he is caught between fulfilling his promise to Emily and Victoria.

There are a few laughs in the film which helps give the movie a lighthearted quality. For a movie with such a dark theme, the puns are almost essential. For instance, there is a severed head in the world of the dead who is the 'head waiter' for the bar. Dark, yet funny.

The film is so completely stimulating to watch visually. Stop motion animation captured the feel of the film so much more perfectly than any other medium could have. The amount of time, talent, and patience that goes into stop motion just amazes me.

The characters were brought to life through the superb voice acting. I don't think they could have picked better actors to portray the voices. Depp does a wonderful job of making Victor sound mousy, gentle, and soft-spoken. Watson gives Victoria an air of refines yet gentleness and sweetness. Bonham Carter's voice completely rules the movie as the quirky, solemn, and benevolent Emily.

You can always spot a Burton film from a mile away. They all have this dark and solmber feel to it (some more than others). Michael Johnson worked with Burton on 'James and the Giant Peach' and 'Corps Bride' has much of that same 'feel' to it.

As much as this film was pleasing to the eye to watch, it still had its problems too. For one, the movie was too short. Though The Nightmare Before Christmas and the Corpse Bride were both the exact same running time of 76 minutes, Corpse Bride just felt too short. I think that Burton could have beefed the movie up a bit and developed the relationships and characters a bit better. The characters weren't drawn very deeply; they were a bit one dimensional. I really didn't have that much feeling for the characters in the movie because of this.

I could see a few parents having problems with parts of this movie. For instance, there is one part where Victor agrees to essentially commit suicide in order to completely validate his marriage to Emily. This is a bit heavy and dark for some audiences to grasp. Also, the part where the the corpse bride emerges from the earth would have frightened the heck out of me as a young child.

Now, I am a HUGE fan of Danny Elfman, but this soundtrack did not cut it with me at all. The musical scores came across more as dry and annoying then anything else. There was too little emotion and feeling in the music and singing. This was such a disappointment for me. Elfman has such a wonderful tallent to bring life to films by bringing in the emotion that you just can't get through the visuals. However, the scenes that were supposed to be full of sorrow and emotion came across as unfeeling and jaded through his music. The soundtrack came across as rushed and slapped together for me in this film.

Overall, it was an okay movie. It was certainly entertaining to watch and there was a lot of talent that went into it, it just didn't tug at my heartstrings like a lot of other Burton films have for me. Visually it's an amazing movie, plot wise, it fell short.",1127606400,,4467,4.608805031446541
2463358,5,B000CEXEWU,"""The Corpse Bride"" is a masterpiece, a gleefully morbid romp that is unmistakably the work of Tim Burton. Some have snidely remarked that the film is a success because Tim Burton has returned to his roots as an animator and that is where he should stay. I would disagree, ""The Corpse Bride"" is a great film not merely because it is rendered in animation. Rather, it is a success because Burton has spun a tale in which he is free to endulge his dark side. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" didn't come together as it should have because Burton made the tragic mistake of imposing his gloomy and at times just plain odd vision onto a story that didn't gel with it at all, creating a grotesque mismatch. I maintain that ""Charlie"" would have worked had Burton been guided by his lighter side, as he was in ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure"" It is obvious that Burton is more comfortable with this sort of material, but he is capable of other types of fare, he should not confine himself to a certain style of storytelling and least of all to a particular medium.

Even thogh Burton got the tone and atmosphere right this time, some still crow that he failed to outshine the film that introduced us to his spooky aesthetic ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" They charge him with being repetitive and technically they are right. ""Corpse Bride"" will instantly remind viewers of ""Nightmare"" and we could take the charge even further. ""Nightmare"" took obvious inspiration from ""Vincent"" (Burton's animated short included on the Special Edition DVD of ""Nightmare"".) We could take the charge further still and say that the illustrations in ""The Melancholy Death of Oyster-Boy,"" (Burton's collection of poetry) look eerily similar to the characters in ""Nightmare."" However, it's not really repetitive, it's just Tim Burton being himself. Let's be honest and admit that is percisely what we came to see.",1127520000,,1883,4.866043613707165

But, when a corpse of a murdered bride pops out and claims that she is Victor's rightful bride, He has a dilimma that sends him to find out if there really is true love in death til we part.

Tim Burton has been notoriously known to have a weird style of film aking. Look at his films, Beetlejuice, Ed Wood, Big Fish. They have all have strange characters. This film is no exception. Burton sets out that he still has his style and weirdness. He is probably the only one of the filmmakers that can show beauty in things grotesque. He takes the weirdest things, the weirdest people, and somehow makes them human. He shows that the grossest things have a heart, and that you can care for them. He is a great storyteller. He can take stories and make them into fairy tales, myths of legend, or just plain legend. He strokes the imaginations of all his viewers by providing us with great visuals and vibrant colors. Tim Burton can make some very beautiful films. This can be added to that list.

Danny Elfman has created some great songs and scores for Burton. This was probably one of his most solid efforts as a composer. His score perfectly fit the scenes and his songs were great. He can take the music and make the scene even more beautiful with his score. His score can make or break the film, but it didn't have to because of some of the score was fantastic.

The voice work was solid. I thought that Johnny Depp was perfect for the part of Victor, because he has that style and the voice that would suit the character. Also, Helena Boham Carter also did some great voice work, and I am glad to see that she is getting mainstream work, after all of her long years on the independent circuit. Also, Albert Finney and Christopher Lee were great as their respective characters.

The only problem that I had was with the short runtime. I felt that they could've made it longer and devolop it more, but it is stop-motion animation, after all. Even if they made it longer, it would take more time and money to do that and it would end up making the film come out later than this year. I was glad that they got a beautiful film done in the short amount of time that they did it in. I was please that they accomplished a whole lot.

Overall, This was a beautifully, vivid movie made by the king of quirkyness, Tim Burton. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was a great animaton, and it deserves some regonition and respect from people that love and cherish Burton's films. I feel that Tim Burton is a great master of the art of making quirky things beautiful. Some people say that Sam Mendes is the king, but in my humble opinon, I feel that Tim Burton is the king of all things quirky.

But a lot of people are probably asking, is it better than The Nightmare Before Christmas?  Well, I watched Nightmare tonight so I could compare and I have come to a conclusion.  It is a perfect draw.  Both movies are fantastic.  Corpse Bride's benefit is the inclusion of my favorite actor, Johnny Depp, while the advantage to Nightmare is, just by a hair, the music is a little better.

The film boasts some very strong voice work by everyone, so I won't single out just a few. Danny Elfman rarely turns in anything less than spectacular, and this is no exception. His music is wonderful and most of the songs are inventive and fun.

2463362,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's second film this year is Corpse Bride. His first film this year was his whacky version on Charlie and The Chocolate Factory in which Johnny Depp (upcoming The Libertine, Secret Window) also starred as a the insanely Willy Wonka. In Corpse Bride, Burton and his crew bring back the feel that The Nightmare Before Christmas gave and Corpse Bride hits the bullseye dead on target, enjoyble story with funny moments and some pretty decent songs. Depp voices Victor Von Dort, who is getting married to Victoria (Emily Watson, Red Dragon, Gosford Park) but here's the thing, Victoria's parents are grouchos and at the rehearsle, Victor kinda gets a little nervous, screws it up, so he takes a stroll in the woods and accidently places the ring for Victoria on a finger of a corpse...the corpse girl rises from the ground and she winds up taking Victor underground where there is other dead people. Victor must be dreaming, he wants this not to be real but he isn't imagining this, he actually proposed to his newly Corpse Bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter, Big Fish, Fight Club), who died years ago waiting for the one she was going to marry to come along but he never so, so she waited for him and  she wound up a corpse. So, after hearing that Victoria is marrying someone else, Victor decides he should marry Emily but in order for him to do so, he has to drink poison and die himself. So, the ghastly skeletons and deadites walk among the living for the marriage between The Corpse Bride and Victor. Anyway, that's all I'm going to tell you...I don't want to give away the whole movie but for what it was worth, Corpse Bride is bound to be another Tim Burton classic. Also starring the voices of

2463363,3,B000CEXEWU,"Corpse Bride is a decent enough little story. And yes, it is little. It also traffics in Tim Burton's cinematic necrophelia, which I used to think was a ploy, a marketing campaign masquerading as a mysterious creative bent. I'm not so sure anymore. Yes, it's at least partially a ploy, but the Corpse Bride gave me pause. Maybe Burton is more of a genuine kook than I previously believed. It's hard not to walk away from Corpse Bride without feeling a bit soiled by it, and what appears to be Burton's infatuation (and identification) with the dead. Underneath the stylized exterior, Burton just seems more comfortable with death and decay than with the living. Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and The Nightmare Before Christmas all took the side of the underworld at the expense of the living. Even Burton's Willy Wonka had a bit of the undertaker in him.

Putting that aside, Corpse Bride tells a loose tale of a young man whose love and life -- and marriage -- intersect with young woman/corpse who died because of an evil suitor who left her on the night they were to elope. The young man ends up in a lover's triangle, pulled by love for his living fianc and compassion toward his dead bride (to whom he is wed, mistakenly, in a private rehearsal of his vows in a cemetary buried deep in the woods). The evil suitor tries to steal the young man's living bride, as well, and in an rather emotionally limp back and forth -- who will the young man really marry, when, and why? -- we eventually are led to a climax that is marginally satisfying. The corpse bride apparently finds some redemption, though not love, when she transforms into a bunch of glowing moths and rises up in the pale moonlight. The young man is left with his living fianc, though it is unclear, at story's end, exactly how much they love each other. (After all, he was all set to marry the corpse again, only to have the corpse refuse to seal their vows.)

Burton has a problem with compelling storytelling. He can be good, but there's always a bit of tone-deafness to his movies. This is a good example. In what should have been a moving, modern fairy tale, there's a weakness of construction, a muddiness of the moral, an androgynistic weakness of voice and character prevents its reaching any real depths and touching the audience as it might. For a while, Disney had this down ... with Beauty and the Beast and The Little Mermaid as good examples. Burton simply doesn't.

One can't help but like Corpse Bride in its inventiveness of look and the fact that it at least aspires to originality. That means a lot in this year of cinematic schlock. Tim Burton may be the best movie fantasists we've got, and while we can hope for better, we ought to keep giving him chances. And it may be time for him to take a break from Danny Elfman. Elfman's collaborations with Burton have led to weaker and weaker soundtracks and songs, with this one (and Willy Wonka) being eminently and disappointingly forgettable.",1127433600,,2980,4.618867924528302
2463364,5,B000CEXEWU,"I have been looking forward to seeing ""Corpse Bride"" ever since I learned that it was in production. I was not disappointed...Tim Burton always makes amazing films, and this one is no exception.

The animated tale revolves around Victor (voiced by Johnny Depp), a young and somewhat jumpy young man who is betrothed to Victoria (voiced by Emily Watson), a girl he's never even met before. The parents of the newlyweds-to-be are both hoping that the union of their children will better their own reputations and ease their financial burdens. Victor and Victoria finally meet and are pleasantly surprised to discover that they actually like each other. When Victor botches the wedding rehearsal, he rushes out into the woods to practice his wedding vows. He places Victoria's wedding ring on a tree branch, which suddenly grips his hand and emerges from the earth attached to a corpse bride (voiced by Helena Bonham Carter). She takes the unwilling Victor to her home, the land of the undead, which exists beneath the surface of the earth. Victor struggles with his new bride while poor Victoria must cope with the evil man her parents have found to fill in for Victor at the wedding ceremony.

The animation in ""Corpse Bride"" is phenomenal...if this movie doesn't win the Best Animated Feature category at the Academy Awards, I'll be furious! But the animation isn't the only amazing thing about this movie. The storyline is fun (and perhaps slightly predictable, but what can you do?) and the characters are extremely well-developed. There are several musical numbers in this film, all of which are very enjoyable. (I especially enjoyed the skeleton jazz band!) I guess the only complaint I have is that I wish it was a slightly darker film. Burton is famous for his extreme creepiness...I was basically expecting to see an animated version of ""Sleepy Hollow,"" but this is much more along the lines of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" which was an amazing Burton movie but is still geared toward children. There's nothing wrong with that, of course...it's just that I'm an adult and I prefer Burton when he's at his most macabre. :)

Overall, ""Corpse Bride"" is a wonderful film. It's a great movie to take the kids to see before Halloween, but adults who are fans of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp will enjoy it as well.",1127433600,,2317,4.875634517766497
2463365,4,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is a classic. I think we can all agree on that. Directed by Henry Selick, who would also work with Burton on ""James and the Giant Peach"", ""Nightmare"" is a delightful mix of stop-motion animation, comedy, songs and Tim Burton's warped view of the world and holidays in particular.

It took twelve years, but Tim Burton's newest stop-motion animated film has just been released. ""Corpse Bride"" shares many things with its predecessor, but it lacks two key ingredients to help the film become a classic.

Victor's (Johnny Depp) parents, the Van Dorts (Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) are newly rich fishmongers, living in Victorian England, a dark and gray place, both in aesthetic and mood. In an effort to establish themselves in society, they have arranged for Victor to marry Victoria (Emily Watson), the daughter of the Everglots (Joanna Lumley and Albert Finney), society people who are now broke. Therefore, the marriage will benefit both families. Victor and Victoria meet for the first time shortly before the wedding rehearsal with Pastor Galswells (Christopher Lee). Galswells quickly loses his patience with Victor, who, very nervous, can't remember his lines. The pastor sends Victor away to practice. Walking around, practicing, Victor unwittingly says his vows correctly and marries the Corpse Bride (Helena Bonham Carter). Soon, Barkis Bittern (Richard E. Grant) arrives and makes a play for Victoria as Victor struggles to make everything right.

The stop motion animation used in ""Bride"" has clearly developed significantly in the last twelve years. The movements and facial expressions are more fluid and lifelike adding to the look of the film. Reportedly, they were able to build armatures into the puppets to change their facial expressions. In ""Nightmare"", they had to change the heads to reflect a new expression. All of these advances help to make the figures move as though they were hand- or computer-animated.

The production design is rich in detail. The characters are one of the most interesting aspects of the film. Victor and Victoria are both very skinny with pasty white skin from underexposure to the sun. Their clothes are tight and formfitting, all adding to an authentic, if stylized, take on the period. Victor's mother is a robust, big framed woman and Victoria's father is short and round, both examples of people with more money and food than activity.

Set in Victorian England, the production design seems heavily influenced by Charles Addams' cartoons. The interior of the Everglot Mansion has been painted in shades of gray and black, but this is an effect of few and small windows throughout the house, another good period detail. What light is able to penetrate is gray as a London fog.

All of the voice actors are very good, providing the right amount of serious intonation for the characters. This brings us to one of the problems with the film. ""Bride"" is much more serious than its predecessor. The story is much closer to one of the Grimm's Fairy Tales, with no Tim Burton-esque moments added. The story is very dark and fable-like, which is interesting and works, but it isn't funny. It seems odd that they would take what is basically a dramatic story and animate it. Perhaps they are trying to challenge the parameters of animation with this film. If this is the case, why did they add a few moments of attempted humor? If you are going to tell a drama, tell a drama. If you want people to laugh, make it funny. Do one or the other the best you can. Don't try to do both half heartedly.

Shortly after Victor proposes to the Corpse Bride, she takes him ""downstairs"" to her world, where all of the ghosts and skeletons live and play. This sequence features a song by Mr. Bonejangles (Danny Elfman) explaining what happened to the Corpse Bride. It is an amusing sequence but it is entirely out of place in this film. In addition to the previously mentioned thematic inconsistencies, the sequence doesn't match the rest of the film in style. The sequence is filled with Mexican Day of the Dead characters and illustrations, an interesting design, very cute, very charming. But how does that fit with the Victorian England design of the rest of the film?

There are a few songs throughout and they work, to a certain degree. In all of the songs, there becomes a point when the characters start to break into choruses and the choruses are difficult to hear and understand. This may be attributed to the crappy theater I saw the film in, but I am not completely sure of that. Because we can't understand what they are saying, the songs fail to help move the story along, as necessary, and end up slowing the film down.

Note to Warner Bros: If you release a film in ""Limited Release"", don't use the Cineplex Broadway Cinemas in Santa Monica as one of two venues in Los Angeles for your film. This theater is crap and doesn't do your films justice.

What ""Corpse Bride"" needed was Henry Selick. Selick was too busy working on ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" and doing pre-production on his new film (hopefully, not ""Monkeybone 2"") to become involved. Because he directed ""Nightmare"" and didn't direct this film, it is fairly clear that his involvement would have improved the film dramatically.

""Corpse Bride"" has a terrific production design, very good voice acting and a dramatic story. Too bad they felt it necessary to try to make it funny and a musical.",1127433600,,5461,4.873922413793103
2463366,5,B000CEXEWU,"Tim Burton's shown his creative ability is alive and well by releasing two very imaginative visually stimulating films in just over two months. The Latest, Corpse Bride which is originally a russian fairytale takes the stop-animation similar in style and astetic to ""A nighmare before Christmas"" and mixes it with highests quality digital effects to produce 76 minutes of beatiful and magical visuals with a great story to boot.  This is a spectacular film just in time for halloween featuring Jonny Depp who is actually quite good and is only one among manny in a star-studded cast.

The story set in Victorian England revoles around an arranged marriage to mix money with pedigree that causes Victor, our protagonist played by Jonny Depp, to have second thoughts about his marriage to Victoria. At the 11th hour after running away from his rehersal some strange happenings occur and he is betrothed to Emily the corpse bride and taken to the nether world, which is actually more alive than Victor's World of the living. With plenty of silly antics and strange but joyful dead beings who seem to enjoy parties games and all around good times.  Of course Victor doesnt enjoy this new place spends all of his time scheming as to how to to get out of his new situation and back up there. Amidst all this there is another certain individual that shakes up the whole plot as he attempts to marry Victoria while Victor is away.

Sadly, stop motion animation in the wake of computer animation is becomining a true rarity. The cost of producing such a file is radically higher than computer animation. Burton should be commended for making such a brilliant film which could very well be the swan song of a genre.

This film is total enjoyment is not too gothic and is no way overly morbid in spite of its necrophiliac plot. The undead are funny and as macabre as the jokes may be they are all in good humor and the whole premise lends itself to a myriad of visual jokes. Corpse Bride is great for all audiences, it won't be too scary for young children, and even with the musical scenes, which to some may seem unecessary, it is a real treat.  The only problem is that is is only 76 minutes long and by the time you get over the spectacle of the film it is nearly over but this is a reason to watch it again.  Burton's done it again - watch this one!
