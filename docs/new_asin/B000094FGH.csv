In the story, a new game show sends young Leo, Jackie, Margaret, and Alex to a remote island. There they will compete against each other in a survival challenge for a chance to win a million dollars. But on the way their plane crashes in an uncharted island, where they are forced to team up to survive. And by the way, there are dinosaurs. T-Rexes, Raptors, Pterodactyls and more dinosaurs are to be found on the island. This show is a fast paced action-adventure movie. This movie is one of those that parents or babysitting teens will not mind watching too. My 13 year old still likes it. Released in 2002 and it is 75 minutes long.

Now to be sure, this is not a National Geographic or Discovery Channel documentary, and the dinosaurs are cartoons. They could be a lot more frightening and realistic as one reviewer points out, but they work great for a kids animated feature. It is a fun show.

The same animation studio, ""DIC"", has released other titles to video and TV, such as animated versions of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Treasure Island, Globehunters, Zorro, and Dinosaur Island. The last 2 titles are really good. They also made the Archie's movies and the Inspector Gadget. Extras on the disc are Inspector Gadget info and fun facts. DVD quality is good, picture and sound clean, no issues with freezing up or anything.",1262649600,,1427,4.592156862745098
