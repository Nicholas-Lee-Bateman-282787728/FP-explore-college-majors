Between this and silly Dave in ""there goes a rescue hero, there goes a rescue vehicle"", he absolutely loves these DVD's that actually TEACH him about fire apparatus and fire-safety.

8095028,5,B000C1F5JI,"Great Video.  My son has watched it over 100 times along with volume one.  His favorite by far of all the action series videos.  He loves the fire dog and the stop, drop, and roll section with all the kids the best.",1067904000,2,215,4.071428571428571
8095029,5,B000C1F5JI,"After getting and watching Firefighter George Volume One, I really couldn't understand why I would get Volume 2.  However, my three year old daughter begged me to get it, so I figured what's another [money amount].  I like this one even better as an adult.  I had no idea that there was so much equipment on a fire engine!  Volume 2 picks up right where Volume One left off and continues to teach how each piece of equipment works.  My daughter totally loves these two videos and has probably watched them 250 times each.  She is an ""Expert"" at naming equipment on the fire engines as they go by.  What a trip that she loves fire engines as a girl!  Oh, and as an adult, I now know the difference between fire engines and fire trucks!  Now I am a 33 year old ""Expert"" with her :-)",1063065600,5,780,4.2517006802721085
8095030,5,B000C1F5JI,"My son is crazy about the first volume in this series and he couldn't wait to get this one. I'm happy to say this one is just as good. Again the firefighters clearly explain how their equipment and vehicles work. This time they get to the ladder truck!  Thankfully they do so in an enthusiastic, but altogether appropriate way.  This is a series that respects kids and their parents. There's no pandering here, just solid information about a subject just about every kid finds facinating. The four boys who visit my son (ages 3-5) also love it!  After your kid watches ""Firefighter George"" a few times, take him/her to a local fire station for a visit.  Your kid will have a lot to talk about.  And you'll be proud.",1055548800,7,715,4.511627906976744
