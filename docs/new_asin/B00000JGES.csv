1232665,4,B00000JGES,"Viewers who seek out this Clara Bow double feature will likely compare it to IT, the 1927 charmer to which all of her films are compared sooner or later, the film that finally captured the most naturally exuberant (and unnaturally wounded) personality in silent film.  Bow had made more than 30 films in the five years preceding IT, only a handful of which survive in any condition.  Even her minor films, therefore, are impossible to ignore.  DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS shows us Bow in 1922, barely 17 years old and fresh as rain.  In her small role as a long-haired tomboy, she neither poses nor emotes; she is simply herself at 17.  The part offers few hints of the luscious flapper whose unembarrassed sensuality would one day startle even Elinor Glyn and deluge Paramount with nearly fifty thousand fan letters a month.  PARISIAN LOVE, released three years after DOWN TO THE SEA, teases us with glimpses of the It Girl-to-be.  But they are tantalizing glimpses: the long tresses are gone, replaced by a pushed-up, snip-sprung, crazy-tilt hairdo that eases our entry into the softest, most haunted eyes that ever looked out of a movie screen.  The silly plot is forgettable; Bow is not.  PARISIAN LOVE should serve as the springboard to a much better Bow film from 1925, THE PLASTIC AGE (available from Image in a twofer with THE SHOW OFF).",1213747200,11,1342,4.725321888412017
1232666,3,B00000JGES,"It is fun to see all of Clara Bow's movies, but since she was such a box office attraction, BP Schulberg put her into movies with lame plots simply because her popularity would make them a hit. Such is the case with Parisian Love, a mediocre story that relies on Bow's appeal to carry it. Bow plays a ruffian, a con artist who works at a nightclub to entertain tourists. Her boyfriend Armand (Donald Keith) and another friend also work as thieves on the side. On one job, Bow's friend is killed and Armand is wounded, left in the estate to be cared for by a rich benefactor. This man does all he can to turn Armand around and in the process away from Bow, so she plots revenge. Her plan? To marry this man and take all of his money. From here, everything goes along with few surprises and few comic sequences. It is such a short movie, that hardly anything interesting can happen expect bring to life a dull story.

Unfortunately, Schulberg not only took advantage of Bow's popularity at her expense, he also had no interest in preserving the films his studio made. This film was believed lost for several decades before it turned up intact, the only known copy. This is what we see here, a nice print with no major errors or signs of deterioration.",1165968000,,1249,4.430434782608696

1232668,3,B00000JGES,"As much as I admire Clara Bow, this film was a disappointment.  Not that Ms. Bow has anything to do with that.  Rather the direction and the technical aspects of the film are not up to her talents. The director (Louis Gasnier), for example, has no idea of how to shoot Ms. Bow.  She possessed one of the most expressive faces in Hollywood history, and eyes that registered emotion so easily that the viewer is never in doubt as to her character's responses.  And yet there is not a single close-up of Bow.  In fact, nearly every scene is shot from middle to long distance, with the camera doing very little.  I realize that the film was made in 1925, but that is no excuse for the lack of creativity Grasnier displays here.  My complaint is also against the tinting, all in  pastel.  Generally I enjoy tinting, but here it adds little to the meaning or pleasure of the film,  and it obscures much that black and white would have revealed.  At times, it looks downright muddy. Finally, the film appears--at least to me--to have been shot slightly out of focus.  There are no clean lines anywhere. Perhaps I underestimate the condition of the film when it was found and the limits of the work of restoration, but I was expecting much more than this.
Clara Bow is her usual wonderful self in the film, and there are scenes that illustrate her persona perfectly--as when, dressed as a maid, she is reduced to fending off, with great spirit, the advances of the ""gentlemen"" at an upper class soiree. Her acting here also shows off her versatility:  she moves faultlessly from playing an Apache dancer at a Paris club to a fine lady seeking vengeance on a man she perceives to be a cad--and there are many transformations in between.  If everything else in the film had been up to her level, it would have been a true gem.",1083369600,,1816,4.496951219512195
1232669,4,B00000JGES,"This DVD double feature of Clara Bow at the beginning and during the thick of her career gives us a fascinating glimpse of one of the most popular silent stars. DOWN TO THE SEA IN SHIPS (1922) was shot when Clara was only 16 by D.W. Griffith protege' Elmer Clifton. Her part is only a supporting one but you can clearly see the star potential there. The main focus of this film is not the romance between the two leads but rather the detailed scenes of New Bedford whalers plying their trade. This makes the film a fascinating historical document which is not for the squeamish as it contains actual and graphic footage of the killing and dismembering of whales. What you see is MOBY DICK for real. This print taken from the Killiam Collection is in good shape although it seems a little fast at times. It is much better than the old VHS version put out by Critic""s Choice some years back.

PARISIAN LOVE (1925) was made only 3 years later but what a difference in Clara's appearance. Here she is the star and fully displays the vivacious charm and charisma that made her so popular. The story of French Apache lovers and their benefactor is a little hard to follow probably due to some missing footage and features some rather curious interplay between the male leads. The sets of Parisian garrets are marvelous and Lillian Leighton steals the show as a Marie Dressler like matriarch at a swanky party. This DVD copy was taken from the only surviving print which was discovered in 1998 and restored by the UCLA Film and Televison Archive. All in all an interesting combination of 1920's style romance with rugged documentary style footage and the chance to see Clara Bow develop from a Mary Pickford like tomboy into a full fledged star. Yet another fine job from Kino International in their ongoing series of silent film presentations on DVD.",1017964800,19,1844,4.63914373088685

7912198,5,B00000JGES,"Alrighty, let's start with print quality:

'Parisian Love' - 5 of 5, beautifully tinted 35mm transfer, stunning and far better than i expected

'Down to the Sea in Ships' - 4.99 of 5, that being said a great deal of the film was shot using hand held cameras on the high seas whereas 'Parisian Love' was shot on a studio lot (the same one, i might add, that Clara used for her other early films such as 'Free to Love' made the same year, which featured a shot of the same staircase but with Clara preceded by teams of men skipping sled-dog style with a length of toilet paper serving for her reigns, while in the other hand she brandishes a thickly feathered fan, an absolutely fabulous entrance scene). Essentially this is by far the best copy of 'Down to the Sea in Ships' that will probably ever be available, it's worth the purchase.

Story line:

'Parisian Love' - If you even remotely like Clara, you'll love this, she's really quite an amazing actress because when you take her characters for what they originally were and then look at how she played them, it's utterly astounding; in 'Dancing Mothers' she broke the 'selfish, spoiled, little brat who doesn't care about anyone' character trope, in 'Mantrap' she broke the 'any girl with a sexual appetite is a slut' character trope, in 'It' she [astoundingly] broke the 'poor girl after rich boss is a heartless gold digger' character trope (something that even later on haunted the screen in Harlow's 'Red Headed Woman', and in this film she plays what was clearly written as trite, overly dramatic trash meant to be performed in that dreadful tragedienne manner found so frequently in cheap, virtually budget-less flicks we all know and loathe. However, Clara not only revitalizes her own rather clich role, she resuscitates the whole damn film, she adds her own very distinct comedic touch to scenes written too seriously (one instance being when she is groped while acting as a maid and pulls a fantastic little faux kick when he turns around that had me laughing out loud, another was when she attends the ball with her mother and tries to limit her alcohol intake) the entire film sparkles with these little glints of her originality, but in spite of Clara's really quite astounding performance, the film as a whole is a lost cause when you consider what she was up against; bland direction, boring story, and a little more than average cast (only the Lillian Leighton and Donald Keith really stand out as far as Clara's fellow cast members go) the film was doomed from the get go, but any fan of Clara or hardcore silent junkie will find it more than enjoyable.

'Down to the Sea in Ships' - long but fascinating as well as entertaining. Something of note; the whaling sequences are real, this is the closest we can get to 'Moby-Dick' on celluloid and almost worth the purchase for that interesting little historical feature alone.",1390953600,2,2895,4.713438735177865
7912199,5,B00000JGES,"This is the release of two Clara Bow films,her first,Down to the Sea in Ships(released Mar/23) and Parisian Love(released Aug/25).They are certainly not perfect,but are in remarkably good shape for their age.
Parisian Love stars,among others,Clara Bow,Donald Keith and Lillian Leighton. The story has Clara and her lover(Keith) working in a French cafe and hustling for a living. During a robbery in a home Keith prevents his partner from killing the home owner. When the cops arrive the homeowner befriends Keith and takes him under his wing,becoming his mentor. Clara temporarily becomes a maid in the house to find out exactly what has happened to her man. When he gets better he is introduced to other society women and is backed financially by the homeowner for a new invention of his,which becomes successful.
Clara swears revenge on the homeowner and goes forth with her plan to make him fall in love with her. On their wedding night Clara reveals who she is to him. As she is leaving,her lover has just returned from abroad and she runs into his arms. The homeowner goes on a sailing trip and wires that he will divorce her right away as his wedding gift to her. This of course frees Clara up to marry her lover.
The film is a typical melodrama of the period,one of several she was cranking out on a regular basis under BP Schulberg(making more money for him than she was earning,by far).But the film is not without its merits and is generally well acted by its leads. Clara has some good turns throughout,and is especially good in a comedic sense with an old lady,as they try to pass themselves off as high society folks. This film's restoration by UCLA was funded by the author of Clara Bow's biography Runnin' Wild,David Stenn,who obviously put his money where his mouth is and is to be commended.
Down to the Sea in Ships stars,among others,William Walcott,Marguerite Courtot,Raymond McKee and Clara Bow. It is a tale of whaling and the Quaker whaling community of New Bedford,Mass. A prominent whaling family patriarch has two daughters,one of which is of marrying age and is promised to to a local rival's hand. When an old childhood sweetheart comes home to claim his property they fall in love all over again. But despite her new love's protests,because he has never whaled,he cannot possibly marry her. Clara is her sister and she is fiery and temperamental and in love with a ships hand. The rival who wants Clara's sister's hand makes arrangements to have the sister's childhood friend shanghaied and taken away in a whaling ship. On board he is forced to work for his passage and it inadvertently gives him the necessary experience to ask for her hand in marriage when he gets back. Clara however has stowed away on board and she is eventually caught. She gets into deep trouble and as the ship nears home,is rescued by her sister's suitor. He arrives back in New Bedford on a dark and stormy night just as the marriage ceremony is taking place. He breaks in at the last moment and saves his future bride from marrying the rival,who is taken away. The final scene is Clara's,as she is reunited with her boyfriend from the ship.
Quite the melodramatic piece,it nevertheless shows a realism of whaling and its people that rings quite true. Many scenes on the water show a whaling crew actually pursuing a pod and harpooning one of them. It is reminiscent of cinema in the very early years,when realism was THE draw for people. Clara is seen in good light throughout and she actually scene steals whenever she is seen(foreshadowing her future endeavours-the camera loved her).This print is from the Killiam collection,and like Parisian Love,is tinted.
Both of these films are in relatively good shape but do show their age and have defects typical of films of this age.
All in all a nice pairing of Clara Bow films that her sea of fans(no pun intended)will absolutely want. One has Clara at the start of her career and the other about half way along. Historically significant and a must have.",1390521600,,4009,4.76978417266187
