761130,5,6304029977,"""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! Is John Waters' favorite film. It's easy to see why! Its star, Tura Satana, plays one of the meanest women in film-and she is completely fascinating. The half-Japanese/Apache Satana looks like Vampira on bovine growth hormones. She is beautiful, voluptuous, evil, and so self-confident that one can't help being drawn to her-if you dare. Her co-stars, Haji (a  curvaceous, saturnine latina beauty) and Lori Williams (a vivacious, luscious Barbie doll of a woman) complete this trio of tough broads. Russ Meyer photographs these gals with such reverence (as you would any natural wonders), and gives them their incredible lines to say.  The film opens with high energy as the 3 ""pussycats"" wildly go-go dance in front of leering bar patrons, then cuts to them speedily driving their sports cars-who wouldn't want to be these gals? In the course of this film, Tura Satana breaks a man's neck, kidnaps his girlfriend, then plots to kill a lecherous old man in a wheelchair (in order to get to his hidden stash of money)-and the film keeps on going, ending like some white-trash Shakespeare play in which almost all of the characters end up dead! Russ Meyer's ""Ode to the Violence in Women"" has drawn such passionate reactions from viewers-from angered feminists, to lusty heterosexual men, to righteous lesbians, to camp-loving homosexuals-you either love this film or hate it-but it certainly isn't dull-all photographed in a crisp, striking black-and-white! And dig the song!",976492800,6,1505,5.163934426229508

761286,4,6304029977,"Welcome to the greats of the trash films in the sixties. Russ Meyer describes an absurd plot with just one pretext. To show us the boundaries of the violence around three disturbed and looser women: Varla (Tura Satana), Rosie (Haji) and Billie (Lori Williams)

Varla is the leader of the team. Once she commits murder on a young man, the spiral of ambition and greed keep on growing. And now the fury will extend to a lonely family, a crippled man and his two sons.

The sixties was shocked by many famous crimes. Truman Capote amazed the world with ""In cold blood"" (a filmic project was in process to be exhibited on the big screen in 1967), Denis Hopper was planing his urban metaphor ""Easy Rider"" and Kubrick was only six years before ""The clockwise orange"".

The film is relentless in its pursuit. The hidden apetites, the double sense jokes and the greed for living a better life are remarked with excess but without never close to gore.

Watch to Lori Williams, the most erotic and appealing woman of the group. She was nineteen by then.

Go for this a bit old-fashioned but very revealing movie of that decade.",1379289600,,1117,4.592964824120603

761383,4,6304029977,"For decades I have heard the praises of Russ Meyer sung by such different critics as Roger Ebert and John Waters, but back in Meyer's heyday I was much too young to get in and see his films for myself; FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! is the first Meyer film I've had a chance to view, although I've been aware of his work for more than four decades.  I well remember VIXEN playing at a neighborhood theater for two straight weeks back in 1970 and can remember admiring the poster for HARRY, CHERRY, AND RAQUEL in the lobby a year later.

FASTER, PUSSYCAT,! Meyer's epic about Vegas go-go dancers on a murder and mayhem spree in the desert, is now considered his best and most famous work, and I was interested to see how well it holds up after all these years.

Much about FASTER, PUSSYCAT! remains rooted in the mid 60's: things like Tommy's plaid shorts, Billie's mini skirt, sports cars drag racing in the desert, and lots of hip slang.  Then there is Meyer's leering attitude toward his buxom beauties, it all now seems to belong to a long gone time when boys still stuffed Playboys under their mattresses.

But on both style and substance, FASTER, PUSSYCAT! was well ahead of its time in the way Meyer celebrates sex and violence; making it a harbinger of a whole new genre of movie making where sleaze and trash would become the hallmark of popular culture.  The America depicted in FASTER, PUSSYCAT!, one completely devoid of morality and common decency, beats NATURAL BORN KILLERS to the punch by 30 years.

And the very uniqueness of FASTER, PUSSYCAT! makes it timeless in a way; there is no other movie that features female characters quite like Varla, Rosie and Billie.  These bad girls on the road are nobody's THELMA AND LOUISE; they are crude, cruel and take what they want when they want.  And woe to any fool who gets in their way.  Tura Satana is rightly celebrated for her nasty Varla, with her awesome body, razor sharp tongue and killer karate moves.  But I think she's matched all the way by Lori Williams's Billie, who showers in the nude under a water tank and has a most memorable drunk scene. Among the mostly hapless male actors, only Stuart Lancaster's pathetic and hateful old man comes close to stealing a scene from Meyer's lethal Amazons.

As much as the sex, it's the violence in FASTER, PUSSYCAT that makes it stand out; most memorable is the scene where Varla beats Tommy to death in the desert or when The Vegetable stabs Billie repeatedly.  For me, nothing tops the sequence where Varla attempts to crush the muscle bound Vegetable with her sports car.

Russ Meyer is long gone now, but his work lives on and his influence can be seen in the works of Tarentino, Paul Thomas Anderson, and even HBO's TRUE BLOOD series.  Not bad for a World War II vet with a great eye for the female form.  Check out FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! and see what I mean; it's worth the time.",1350432000,4,2904,4.555769230769231
761384,4,6304029977,"Russ Meyer made movies known for the shapely actresses in the lead roles.  He wrote his own stories and featured buxom actresses (who could barely act) in dangerous situations.  This movie is a look at female violence.  It is perhaps Russ Meyers most well known movie.

The figures of the three women leads in this were truely amazing, and this was before implants and liposuction.  These three wild women end up kidnapping a young teen, who inexplicably never wears more than a bikini.  They go on a killing spree after being gogo dancers.

There isn't much of a plot or any interesting dialog.  The actors can't really act.  So why watch it?  It's camp, fun and titilating.  You need to see the fun in bad movies to be able to enjoy this.  I like old cars and liked seeing an old Porche, MG Mark 3000, and Triumph TR3 racing around, driven by the three wild gogo dancers.

There were numerous shots of the blond gogo dancer in white shortshorts from behind as she walked away.

The lead actor was Tura Satana.  She was a mixture of Japanese, Irish-Scottish, and American Indian, making her quite exotic looking.  She had a lot of input in the making of this movie, including coming up with some funny lines, such as one to a gas station attendant who is telling her he wants to travel.  He is gawking at her bust as she tells him ""Whatever you're looking for, you won't find it down there, Columbus.""  She did all her own stunts and didn't use a double in the fight scenes.

I've seen Russ Meyer movies that I liked more than this.  They all feature women in bikinis and tight clothes running through the wilderness.

If you can get into some real lowbrow movies now and then, you might enjoy this.  There is nothing at all to recommend this movie, except that it's cheap, sleazy and fun.  I found it really enjoyable.",1349222400,3,1820,4.4817073170731705
761385,5,6304029977,"Three sensation seeking go-go dancers: the tough homicidal big bad mama Varla (the marvelous Tura Satana), the good time gal Billie (Lori Mitchell) and the moody Rosie (Haji) kidnap a teenager (Sue Bernard) after killing her boyfriend (Ray Barlow). But when they end up at an isolated ranch owned by an old crippled lech (Stuart Lancaster), who lives with his muscle bound but mentally backward son (Dennis Busch) and a quiet book reading son (Paul Trinka), they may have met their match! While not quite the wonky masterpiece of his BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, this Russ Meyer exploitation flick comes pretty close. Wickedly funny, Meyer's cartoonish undertaking is like the darker side of Frank Tashlin's Jayne Mansfield movies. Mammaries are either coming at you or female posteriors are walking away. Curiously given Meyer's reputation, there's no actual sex or nudity but profuse drams of violence. Like DeMille who seemed to enjoy showing us the pleasurable excesses of the wicked before giving them their just desserts, Meyer seems a Puritan at heart as he takes glee in these three tough babes causing havoc before the wrath of God comes down on them. But there's no doubt Meyer and his cameraman Walter Schenk have an eye for composition, the B&W images approach lyricism.

The Arrow DVD via Great Britain is region 0 so it should play in all players. The transfer is a nice, crisp B&W picture. Extras include retrospective interviews with the four female leads.",1344729600,2,1475,4.995934959349594

But Tura Satana and the other Pussycats are a nuther story! For one thing, they're the only bunch of Russ Meyer vixens that even come close to passing the test of time (and I know coz I saw 'em all, back when RM was considered nothing more than a ""skinflick director"")

Meyer tried, but to me he was never again able to bring his most startling, disturbing and possibly unique vision of Womanhood to full fruition on the screen again. I mean, Woman as Avenging Earth Goddess, able and determined to pay back the karmic sins of the male a hundredfold. I think it's coz he couldn't find another Tura, Haji or Lori.

These outlandishly curvaceous specimens of femininity truly ARE larger than life, and they bone-crack, ball-crunch and Boxter-zoom their way across the existentialist desert of Meyer's soul with such gleeful gusto they've taken us B movie fans with 'em ever since.

761389,4,6304029977,"For a long time Russ Meyer's Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! was the holy grail of cult films. It was extremely hard to get a good copy of the film and it seemed that more people were talking about the movie than had actually seen it. John Waters once called it the greatest movie ever made. Arrow releasing has remedied this problem by finally releasing the film in this country on DVD and now the film can easily be seen in all its black and white glory.

Three thrill-seeking go-go dancers--Billie (Lori Williams), Rosie (Haji), and their leader, Varla (Tura Satana)--encounter a young couple in the desert while racing their sports cars. After killing the boyfriend (Ray Barlow) with her bare hands, Varla drugs, binds, gags and kidnaps his girlfriend, Linda (Susan Bernard). On a desolate highway, the four stop at a gas station, where they see an old man (Stuart Lancaster) and his muscular, dimwitted son, Vegetable (Dennis Busch). The gas station attendant (Mickey Foxx) tells the women that the old man and his two sons live on a decrepit ranch with a hidden cache of money. Intrigued, Varla hatches a scheme to rob the lecherous old man, who uses a wheelchair. What follows next is the stuff of B-movie history.

What is amazing about this film is how well it stands up to the test of time. Audiences have rediscovered the film after dismal reviews when the film was first released. The film offers a powerful message of female empowerment that was unique in its day and remains so now. The film despite its age and low budget looks great and Meyer's direction and editing are spot on.

The Arrow DVD offers quite a few special features. Directed and written by David Gregory, Go! Pussycats! Go! is a 25 minute 27 second documentary featuring interviews with antagonists Tura Satana, Haji, Lori Williams and victim, Susan Bernard. An interesting recollection by these three super women about Meyer, and the filming of Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! This retrospective documentary is excellent, and has some great recollections of the filming, the times and of Russ Meyer himself.

There are two commentaries on this disc. The first is by Russ Meyer himself. Meyer discusses the motivations of the characters explores some of the subtleties that may be overlooked by even the devout fan of this flick. His commentary is informative and entertaining and contains some great behind the scene tales. The second commentary is by the superwomen themselves: Tura Satana, Haji and Lori Williams, with assistance by John Cregan which discusses their respective careers and their experiences on this film. At times this seems more like a radio interview, with the occasional anecdote upon visual cues from the film, but is still informative and engaging.

761468,4,6304029977,"This is surely the mother of all cult films.  Russ Meyer's FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! has everything you could ever want in a movie - fast cars, even faster women, violence, sex, dirty old men, dimwit girls, and the Watusi.

Go-go dancers Varla (Tura Satana), Rosie (Haji) and Billie (Lori Williams) head off into the desert with their cars for a few kicks.  Meeting up with a preppy amateur speed-racer and his whiny teen girlfriend Linda (Sue Bernard), Varla challenges him to a race, which ends in his death and the young girl's kidnap.  Varla and her gang then move on to an isolated house belonging to a wheelchair-bound old lech and his two yokel sons, whom they plan to rob; not quite realising that the old man is every bit as depraved and cunning as they are...

It's not every movie that you find yourself cheering on the ""villain"", but that's precisely what happens in FASTER, PUSSYCAT! (1965). Tura Satana's Varla is every cult movie fan's ultimate dream woman.  She's sexy, she's stacked, she can kill you with her pinky finger.  And she can spew out one-liners like nobody's business.  Russ Meyer really hit the jackpot with Ms Satana, who at the time was just beginning to break into the movies (she was Suzette Wong, one of Shirley MacLaine's colleagues, in Billy Wilder's ""Irma la Douce""), had trained in martial arts, and also worked as a real striptease dancer, so her role in FASTER, PUSSYCAT! wasn't entirely far-fetched for the late actress.  It's a real pity that Meyer and Satana didn't continue their screen collaboration - any other director would have spun Varla off into an entire series of movies.

Haji is dynamite as Varla's partner (a subtext in the script paints Varla and Rosie as lesbian lovers, but Russ Meyer wisely didn't let the ladies in on the secret until filming wrapped!).  Lori Williams is the ""odd one out"" in the trio of thrill-happy harlets.  Known primarily for dancing in Elvis Presley and ""Beach Party"" movies, Williams contrasts dramatically with Satana and Haji, not only in her blonde looks, but also because she clearly doesn't hail from the same background in showbusiness.  The less said about Sue Bernard's role of Linda the better.  She's so annoyingly over-the-top that I wished Varla had slapped her more often.  The men in the film serve only to act as the ladies' punching bags and bed-buddies; they are so cardboard that they make Varla and the girls seem even more full-blooded.

The film stars Tura Satana (""The Doll Squad""), the living definition of voluptuousness, and she delivers some of the sauciest dialogue since Mae West. Like West, Satana uses her physique to add the exclamation point to her words. The story is laden with camp and characters who are all-too familiar: the dim-witted stud, the cranky old desert dweller, and a trio of go-go dancers who follow their sadistic leader into the desert where they encounter the aforementioned cast of cliches.

761528,4,6304029977,"""Ladies and gentlemen: Welcome to violence!""

 With these six words Russ Meyer's classic FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! sets the stage for what has become a cult classic.  Esteemed director John Waters even goes so far as to declare this pinnacle of campy exuberance ""beyond a doubt the best movie ever made.""  Of course, declaring PUSSYCAT! your favorite offering from King Leer is like saying ""Cherry Garcia"" is your favorite Ben & Jerry ice cream flavor.  Decisions, decisions...

 Let's start with the glorious title.  In the history of American cinema has there ever been a more improbable, enigmatic one?  Methinks not.  In fact, not until I ran across a CD of the CHERRY POPPIN' DADDIES have I encountered such a resplendently randy rubric.  Titular issues aside (pun intended), some cineastes believe PUSSYCAT! to be nothing more than a ""B-Movie.""  If you are thinking of brash, bizarre, brazen, bawdy, beguiling, bloody and/or buxom, then in a sense it is a B-Movie.  But there's more, much more.  Below the surface of seething, overheated eroticism and ultra-violence there lies a remarkably subversive, scathing social satire, unlike anything ever seen previously on the screens of rural drive-ins throughout the New World.  Capitalizing on some of the most driving male adolescent fetishes: big breasts, hot babes, cheap thrills, jazzy music, ultra-violence, and the promise of sex -- especially the kind that might leave a mark or two -- one could argue that Russ Meyer, America's Number One Tit-Man, was to the silver screen what Larry Flint was to the printed page.  This country's pubescent party boys are forever thankful.

 The successively surprising, sordid screenplay by Jack Moran, based on an original story by Meyer, tells the tale of three sizzlingly-hot go-go dancers who leave work in their souped-up sports cars in search of sinful pleasures.  They are unlike any trio of tantalyzing, tormenting temptresses to ever grace the silver screen.  If you are thinking Charlie's Angels, think again.  The leader of this wolf pack is Varla (Tura Satana in the role of a lifetime).  Ms. Satana started her exotic dancing career at the young age of 13, and her intriguing ""look,"" reportedly the result of her being half Japanese and half Apache, is unforgettable, as is her cleavage, the likes of which I haven't seen since standing on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon.  Rosie, portrayed by the actress simply known as Haji, is the statuesque Italian hot-head who for reasons totally beyond me delivers her dialogue as though she were Chico Marx.  Honest.  The third member of this torrid trifecta is Billie (Lori Williams), the absolutely beautiful blonde babe with a conscious, although admittedly it is only about as large as the alluring navel in the center of her delectable drum-tight belly.  Ms. Williams is the epitome of a wet dream and I cannot for the life of me figure out how someone with such a fine figure didn't go on to a much bigger career.

 Trouble begins when Varla brutally murders a nice young man in the desert.  This occurred in plain sight of the young fellow's girlfriend, Linda, played by the Playmate of the Month for December 1966, Sue Bernard.  The perky Linda is sedated and forced to be a hostage.  At a gas station Varla learns that a cranky old man (Stuart Lancaster) confined to a wheel chair has a fortune stashed away somewhere on his run-down ranch, and so the girls soon make it their business to do whatever is necessary to get the dough away from the codger and his two sons -- the big, burly bumpkin simply known as ""The Vegetable,"" poignantly portrayed by Dennis Busch (no apparent relation to George W.), and the older brother, Kirk (Paul Trinka) who, among this motly family of men, is the most normal.  Of course, carnage ensues, but not after some sexy seduction, seething, sleazy eroticism and snappy dialogue chock full of dime-novel double entendres from Double-D dames.

 Meyer exhibits considerable restraint in keeping away from nude shots; to do so would have robbed these women of their erotic power.  In fact, while PUSSYCAT! was considered scandalous when initially released in 1965, today I suspect it would receive nothing more than a PG-13 rating.  How times have changed.  What hasn't changed, however, is the void of female empowerment films, and that's one of the reasons PUSSYCAT! has firmly established its place in cinematic history.  Meyer accomplishes this in a variety of ways.  For example, most shots of our vexing vixens are from a low angel, adding to the feeling of female dominance, especially when it comes to Varla.  And these girls do kick ass, male ass especially.  Their celebration of all that is ""right"" about being ""wrong"" would make Mae West proud.

 With a paltry $45,000 budget, the film is extremely well made.  The original music, under the supervision of Paul Satell and Bert Sheffer, is wonderfully loud and packs a wallop that would put John Williams down for the count.  The theme song by The Bostweeds is just about perfect, as is the fast-paced, razor-sharp editing by Meyer.  And no discussion of PUSSYCAT!  would be complete without mentioning the terrific composition by Director of Photography Walter Schenck which, no doubt, was heavily influenced by Meyer who was a highly respected combat photographer serving with the Army Signal Corps in World War II.  (As an aside, I discovered that Meyer first visited a whorehouse while stationed in France.  He was taken there by Ernest Hemingway.  Now we know for whom the bell tolled.)

 If you haven't seen FASTER, PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! you need to go out and find a copy.  With all due respect to John Waters, this may not be the very best movie ever made, but it's one heck of a lot of fun -- especially with a scoop or two of Ben & Jerry's to keep you cool.

761585,4,6304029977,"How dare you consider yourself a cult movie fan if you've never seen this film!  Well, it is forgivable considering that in order to see this movie you either have to A) have forty bucks lying around to make a purchase on a film you've never seen, or B) have a video store in your vicinity that actually rents stuff like this out.  Neither of these are very likely.  But if you happen to catch this movie, it is a treat.  Meyer's early 60s work is quite different than the goofball sex pictures he'd do down the road.  In Faster Pussycat, three go-go dancers(led by the yummy Tura Satana) out for a joyride end up killing a guy and taking his girlfriend hostage.  Then they catch wind of a crippled old hermit who has a bunch of money stashed away on his land.  They devise a plan to seduce the two sons of the man and make off with the money.  They soon realize that the old man is just about as crazy(if not crazier) than they are.  Like I said, this is different than the later Meyer films.  There's actually a bit more plot.  In fact, the plot is almost something you could see the Cohen Brothers doing.  There's no nudity or sex(plenty of innuendo), but the three lead women just ooze sexuality regardless of what they may be doing, whether eating dinner or beating the snot out of a guy.  Especially Tura Satana, who looks so sexy, yet so dangerous that you're not sure if she'll throw you in bed to do the deed or break your neck.  I'm sure it was rather risque for the time though. Exploitation films from this time period have the coolest look about them.  The women, the fashions, the music, the muscle cars.  It's easy to see why this film is such an inspiration to bands like White Zombie and The Cramps(if you're not familiar with Meyer, but happen to be a Cramps fan, it'll give you an idea of the movie to think that this is what a film directed by The Cramps would look like).  If you come across it, or have forty bucks lying around with nothing to do, check this one out.  Meyer's style may not be your bag, but at least you'll be able to say you've seen the film.

761586,5,6304029977,"Most B-movies produced for the drive-in market are watchable once or twice. This is one of a handful that improve with repeated viewings. And speaking of handfuls, let's look at the Pussycats themselves. First, there's Tura Satana as Varla. She must have taken a deep breath before every take, because she belts out almost every line of dialog with amazing force and menace. The only time she speaks at all rationally is when she's lying. Then, her whole persona changes to a shrugging deadpan. Lori Williams as Billy is the weakest of the three, though she would have dominated a normal drive-in flick. And her drunk scene is pretty much of a blast. But it's Haji's performance as Rosie that's the secret gem of this movie. She has the perfect undefinable latina accent-- neither Italian nor Spanish. In fact, she's a Canadian, and had to learn the accent. Hers is a wonderfully mannered, sneering performance I can't take my eyes off of.

Of the men, Stuart Lancaster chews the scenery brilliantly as the rich, crippled, cantankerous old letch. Leering and sneering, and drinking heavilly at lunch. And his hulking yet mentally challenged son The Vegatable is great fun to watch, too. Squinting with concentration before each halting line of dialog. Secretly gentle, despite the vile things the old man wants him to do. And, like most of the characters in Pussycat, he seems like he could have been written by Tenessee Williams on LSD.

Most of the dialog is quotable, and just about every frame could be enlarged to hang on the wall. This and Meyer's equally brilliant Beyond the Valley of the Dolls have had unestimable influence on directors as diverse as John Waters and Quinton Tarrantino. But, despite having been strip-mined over the years, retain a strange and often shocking vitality. As Richard Corliss said of Dolls, they mix evrything generally associated with both ""good"" and ""bad"" movies. And, while I take a break evey once in a while (you can't have candy for dinner every night) every time I come back to these flicks, my appreciation of them grows.

So I've finally gotten round to seeing Russ Meyer's magnum opus, and I have to say that, despite the basic Russ Meyer cheesiness, it wasn't all that bad. It's a bit of fluff, to be sure, but an amusing one. The plot: three strippers (led by Irma la Douce's Tura Satana) have some fun in the desert. ""Fun,"" for these pussycats, involves mayhem, murder, and fast cars. But will they meet their match in the family of weirdos they find in the middle of nowhere?

Really, there's no more to it than that. I'm kind of wondering, even after having seen it, how Meyer managed to drag this thin premise out to over eighty minutes.

You won't be disappointed- you just have to own a multi-region dvd player.

  In the interviews, Tura Satana is very candid and offers insightful memories of ""Pussycat"". Hardly, the abbrasive, spine breaking 'Varla'. Haji still so elegant looking and Lori Williams- just timeless. Sue Bernard seems as if she hasn't gotten over Tura's potrayal of 'Varla' and how it affected her but as she quotes,""It gave me more of an impetous in what I was doing."" Now where was the actor who potrayed the 'vegetable'. I would've wanted to of seen some of the male contingency of the flick in the interview extra.

761655,5,6304029977,"The tendency to dismiss Russ Meyer's ""Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!"" (1965) as just a cult classic is probably due to the most memorable feature of the film, the girls.  First there are the two quintessential Meyer women, Tura Satana and Haji, towering brunettes with enormous breasts who dominate all the men around them her; although  Haji's character (with a strange Italian-Mexican accent?)  is more focused on Satana than on men.  They actually come across as a feminist empowerment fantasy,  which is consistent with Meyer's almost exclusive career focus on situations in which women wreak their will upon men.

If they are too extreme for your tastes there is blonde free spirit Lori Williams and air-headed sweet young thing Susan Bernard.  While arguably the two prettiest women to have ever graced a film, there is no argument  that William's character is the sexiest of all time.  Interestingly,  it was the sweet-faced Bernard who became a Playboy centerfold just a few months after the movie (December 1966).

But ""Pussycat's"" greatness comes from the visceral power of Meyer's unusual images (can you say Fellini).  Add to this abundant  humor, inventive camera angles, fast pacing, clever editing, violence, and a generally amoral cast of characters.

The film gets even better with subsequent viewings,  you connect better with the twisted dialogue and the wry humor.

Its a movie made with love by talented hands, subject matter be damned, and is a unique vision to this day.  Its too easy to write this movie off as a cult-ish ""bad movie"" until you've actually watched it.

  Is is amoral?  Not really, in fact there's a string of retribution that's almost karmic.  Is it pornography?  At the time, maybe, but that's questionable - there's really no nudity (that opening go-go dance is as risque as it gets!), only tight outfits and suggestion.  Today it's less explicit than the average FOX reality show.

  So... why watch it?  Aside from being the most unabashedly fun pulpy film ever made, ts a textbook of lowbudget filmmaking, as daring as BLOOD SIMPLE or RESERVOIR DOGS.  This femme fatale world of men portrayed as weak willed and predatory creatures at the mercy of women's sexual powers lingers, and would-be filmmakers should be intoxicated with the possibilities...

  And therin lies PUSSYCAT's blessing and curse... for every Tarantino or Rodriguez it inspires to embrace their cinematic fetishes, its legacy is more bad direct to video movies glutting Blockbuster than good.  These genuinely trashy (i.e.-poorly made, lazy sexploitation) films taint it in the public eyes, and I think the only remedy is for more people to see and love it.

From the deadpan irony of John Moran's script, through Meyer's direction and cinematography to the terrifyingly sexy performances by the Pussycats-- especially Tura and Haji. This movie has a weird chemestry all its own.

One of my many favorite lines has cute little Sue Bernard asking the titular psychotic go-go girl trio, ""Any of you girls care for a soft drink?"" to which uber-latina Haji responds, ""No no. We don't like'a nothin' soft-- everything we like is'a HARD!!""",1121212800,12,722,5.110169491525424
761658,5,6304029977,"Oh yess.. I waited this for so long, and now I got it in DVD. Released by Arrow Films, UK and sold in Amazon UK. Wonder why Amazon US doesn't import it? it also happen to Beyond The Valley of The Dolls. Oh I know, it about region things, right? Don't get me wrong, Amazon US just doing right things. But, if you  really want something, you should browse it anywhere it may sold. Also important to have all region player or DVDR player. my experience, DVD-R player (mostly in PC) can play every region DVD.

About the DVD, it is Region free, 4:3 full frame scene, mono sound (unfortunatelly), running for about 83 mins, and have some extras: Russ's commentary, the girls's commentary, featurette 'go pussycat go', and trailer reel (faster pussycat kill kill, black snake, mudhoney, vixen, wild gals of the naked west, supervixen, beneath the valley of the ultra vixen, cherry harry and raquel, common law cabin)

About the story. Yes, this is one of Russ's that have ""real story"". it's has logic sequence, though some conversation are irrational. It tells us about 3 gogo girls who are wild when they're not on the stage. they play rough, rude, full of violent, you can name it. Varla (Tura Satana), the leader of the pack is a ""natural born killer"" femme fatale. she kill for no reason, just revenge for her unlucky personality. ""Baise Moi"" girls type? Well, tell yourself. Billie (Lori Williams), the cuty one always hungry for man and narcisstic. the story goes about care race, killing a guy, kidnap his girlfriend, cripple old man and his dumb son. a man save the girl, the pack got furious and killing again. Like all heroes story, the climax is in duel between the villain and the hero.

Thanks, Russ... at least you have ""real"" story. big 5 stars for Faster Pussycat Kill Kill",1113350400,4,1783,4.632911392405063
761659,4,6304029977,"Go-go dancers, 60's rock music, independent women, fast cars - one would think that this was a Tarantino flick.  But it isn't.  Forty years ago, this film journeyed out into a territory where it would not follow, only be followed.  Like the California desert where the femme-fatales raced their cars, this film forces the individual to come forward.

There is a complexity in this film epitomized in the women.  The antogonists are brash, violent, and selfish.  They prey upon others and live for the moment.  Yet there are no blameless victims here.  Even the innocent girl, Linda, must bloody her hands before she can ""find herself"".  Yet, every woman is beautiful here.  Thus, there is a tension between the beauty that society ascribes to form and the ugliness ascribed to actions.

The story stands the test of time.  Sure, there have been female ""revenge""/empowerment films through the years, but few display the genuine nature of woman's angst like this film.  Only in recent years, with, perhaps, Tarantino's Kill Bill set, has the topic of the aggressive woman seen justice.  Here, society can see ""the other side.""",1101686400,2,1124,4.973118279569892
761709,5,6304029977,"We happened upon this movie during some late night channel surfing.  The combination of the cool but ultra-mean female desperados and the woman-hating lecherous farmer and his moronic sons sets the scene for the ultimate in trailer trash almost-porn. And, wonderfully, every word that comes out of their mouths is a timeworn over-ridden cliche.  After the first 5 hilarious cliches caused us to howl with laughter, we were hooked.  You will be too.  I must own a copy of this...",1097452800,5,478,4.9375
761710,4,6304029977,"While there are some who argue that it is a pro-feminist flick with lots of social significance, truth is FASTER PUSSYCAT KILL KILL is a very deliberately made bit of ultra-drive-in trash, a movie that glories in all things low-brow, low-rent, and low-necklined.  And it has a cast that makes up for their collective lack of talent with attitude to spare.

The story is as hooty as the cast.  Tura Satana, she of the lethal cleavage, leads minions Haji and Lori Williams away from the grind of their jobs at the go-go joint and out into the desert.  They race their cars.  They wrestle in the water and then in the sand.  They dance the watusi.  They bump off this guy who shows up wearing plaid shorts.  (You might read this as a mercy killing.)  Then they set their sights on an old lech and his dum-dum sons, hoping to make away with their money.  Faster Pussycat indeed!

The script is deliberately absurd, with an emphasis on memorable one liners that try to out-cliche all known cliches. But the real attraction here are the ""pussycats.""  It isn't often that you see a 2D movie with 3D effects, but that's exactly what happens when Tura, Haji, Lori, and their six talents hit the screen.  These are three big-busted, nip-waisted women with evil attitude, and they sneer, snarl, snap, and slither around the screen with all the aplomb of trailer park drag queens gone bad.  It's more ""tacky cool"" than a 1965 plastic jewelry box explosion.

Now, how much you like this sort of thing really depends on how warped your sense of humor is.  Cheap though it is, the thing is remarkably well done, and taken in the right way the combination of trailer-park chic, retro-hysteria, and ultra-attitude is a lot of fun... and when the pussycats hit the screen you may think you're about to get a black eye, and I don't mean from their fists!  Breakout the popcorn and some protective glasses: Tura and the Pussycats are coming at ya!

761711,5,6304029977,"I absolutely love this film.
It's starts with some classic nonsensical voiceover about the violence lurking in women and the unmistakable ""smell of female"" before cutting to our three stars dancing at the go-go club for some disturbingly enthusiastic male patrons.  ""go baby go go go!""
We're quickly brought to the dessert where our story unfolds.  Apparently these three unbelievably buxom ladies are a ""team"" of sorts who don't mind a little violence and mayhem which is quickly proved when their leader kills a man with her bare hands and then kidnaps his whiny girlfriend.  They hatch a plan to rob an old local miser of his life savings.  The miser is shockingly misogynistic and has two sons, one of whom is a muscle bound vegetable. The details and background of these two is slowly revealed through some incredible patches of dialogue which border on campy but maintain a sort of dark edge.  And while there is no nudity or sex depicted anywhere in the film, it is somehow a constant presence:  Billie's hillarious attempts at seducing the ""vegetable"", Varla's gravity defying neckline, the leering old man-it's all sex without being overly graphic unlike later Russ Meyer films.  The dialogue is insanely quotable as it just gets weirder and weirder:the dinner scene is just amazing. ""I never try anything I just do it.  Wanna try me?"" You Tarzan Me Jane, now grab a vine and let's swing"" ""when I've had enough of this (whiskey) it's been known to be passin'-out-time!""  ""we don't like anything soft.  Everything we touch is hard"" All the ""guilty"" characters (which is almost everyone) get their comeuppance in the end in a variety of gruesome deaths.  There really aren't words to do this film justice.  It is a full-on over the top, sexually charged, near camp, film noir masterpiece.  Watch it again and again and again.",1082073600,10,1832,4.870967741935484

761713,3,6304029977,"Produced, Edited, Written and Directed by the great Russ Meyer, FASTER PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! is less overtly sexual than his later work; (To my knowledge this is the only Meyer movie in NZ to have an unrestricted rating) but is still a highly enjoyable & wonderfully politically incorrect cult fave.
The story revolves around three sexy female car club members Varla (Tura Satana), Rosie (Haji) & Billie (Lori Williams) who accept the task of safely delivering home the daughter of a high profile public figure in order to avoid all the media hoopla, for a sizable amount of cash.
Their simple road trip soon takes an unexpected turn when they run out of gas & they are forced to shack up with a paraplegic old man (Stuart Lancaster)& his dimwitted weightlifting son Kirk (Paul Trinka). Naturally in true Meyer fashion the girls use their sex appeal to get what they want- & their feet & fists- this IS Meyer's ""homage to the violence in women"" after all!
FASTER PUSSYCAT KILL KILL is also noteworthy because this movie is actually very feminist minded at its core- so basically Meyer seems to be good-naturedly slapping his critics in the face with this movie. Good on him.
If you've never seen a Russ Meyer film before, here is probably a good starting point; after that I'd recommend you track down copies of BEYOND THE VALLEY OF THE DOLLS; CHERRY, HARRY & RAQUEL and VIXEN. So check this one out & celebrate an era before Political Correctness started to contaminate everything- especially Kiwis; before Labour & the Greens pass a law stating that all DVD players must run on methane gas in order to conserve energy!",1065312000,4,1620,4.74822695035461
761714,5,6304029977,"Easily Russ Meyer's best film to date. This movie has it all: fast cars, voluptuous, beautiful women (they don't make 'em like that anymore!) and the dumb guys they have to beat into submission in order to get their way!
The opening voiceover narration grabs your attention from the get-go with it's hard-boiled style right out of a Sam Fuller movie. A lot of critics have slammed the film for its amateurish dialogue but it has just the right B-movie vibe.
Surprisingly tame by today's standards, FASTER, PUSSYCAT nevertheless is refreshingly un-PC in its attitude. The women in this film don't take any crap -- especially Varla (played to perfection by Tura Santana) who talks tough and backs it up with action (including the climatic scene where she breaks a guy's back with her bare hands!). Forget the CGI'ed CHARLIE'S ANGELS, this movie is the real deal.",1055894400,4,860,4.857142857142857
761715,5,6304029977,"Atypical Russ Meyer movie that features none of his exploitive trademarks but actually concentrates on characterizations of his three stars---the incomparable Tura Satana, sultry Haji, and way-out California girl Lori Williams. Great b&w photography as the girls(go-go dancers in a sleazy club) head out in wild sports cars into the desert in search of thrills. Well, they get 'em when Satana kills a guy and they abduct his screaming idiot girlfriend. They hide out at a desert ranch headed by a VERY weird father/son clan. Satana believes there's a lot of moola on the property somewhere and she aims to find it one way or another. Acting is above-average for a Meyer piece and the film is consistently watchable throughout. No nudity(except for some tasteful bare-back shots as they bathe after the desert incident) and the women are not stupid but tired of being used. This is a first-rate bona-fide cult classic right here and deserves a pristine transfer to DVD. A MUST SEE.",1033344000,12,980,4.9817073170731705
761716,5,6304029977,"Ok, this movie isn't thick on plot. The acting isn't really award winning. Then why is this one of my favorite movies of all time? Simply because this is as COOL a movie as you will ever see. So many movies have actors/actresses pretending to be cool. Some movies seem to try so hard to be hip. This movie doesn't try, it just does it! The women in this movie don't have to pretend. They are the real deal. The 3 women in FPKK are the coolest, sexiest femme fatales you will ever see on film. Tura Satana is the hippest chick ever to grace the silver screen. She is scary as hell, yet what a sexy babe. I can't recall a female lead who was scaring me, wooing me, turning me on, and repulsing me all at the same time.
Each shot in the movie is like a work of art. Shot in black and white, this movie has a timeless look. The soundtrack is great. It is a very, very stylish movie. It is a joy to watch.

7859226,3,6304029977,"Released in 1965 and conceived & directed by Russ Meyer, Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill! is a campy melodrama/crime thriller starring Tura Satana as a sneering vixen who, along with her two go-go dancing pals (Haji & Lori Williams), entertain themselves in their spare time by hot rodding in the desert. After a mishap wherein the trio apprehend a winsome bikini girl (Susan Bernard) they smell easy money at a remote ranch in the desert, inhabited by a rich old man (Stuart Lancaster) and his two sons (Dennis Busch & Paul Trinka). Ray Barlow plays a nice boy desert racer while Michael Finn is on hand as a gabby gas station attendant.

The movie has a big reputation as a cult flick and Meyers definitive film, along with 1970s Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, so I was very interested in finally viewing it. The first 20 minutes or so are fun and entertaining in a swingin 60s kind of way, highlighted by the voluptuous female cast in which Meyer takes full advantage in illustrating their beauty (no nudity). The music, cars, apparel and thrills are additional highpoints.

Unfortunately, once the women happen upon the ranch with the mad Ben Cartwright and Hoss & Adam (sorry, no Little Joe) the lousy writing and corresponding eye-rolling histrionics manifest. Its as if Meyer and fellow writer Jackie Moran were attempting to make a mid-60s desert version of one of Tennessee Williams melodramas, but didn't have the writing expertise or professional cast to pull it off. As such, the story loses the viewers interest and your left to laughing at the exaggerated antics and trying to enjoy the attractions noted above. Being shot in B&W doesnt help matters.

For a better movie that treads similar terrain I suggest the contemporaneous Village of the Giants, which was released a mere 2 months after Faster and is in glorious color. The women are just as good, if not better, and the music is superior, not to mention it lacks an utterly scornful one-dimensional she-devil (dont get me wrong, Turas great, but her character is so one-note disdainful it gets old after 25 minutes and you just want someone, ANYONE, male or female, to knock her silly). Village also doesnt pretentiously try to be a serious 60s tragedy &agrave; la A Streetcar Named Desire in the desert.

The movie runs 83 minutes and was shot in the Mojave Desert (Lake Isabella, Lake Cunniback, Johannesburg, Randsburg & Ollie Pesch's Musical Wells Ranch) and Van Nuys (The Pussycat Club), California.

When the trio stop in a small town to get gas they come across a cripple and his strong but dim-witted son.
