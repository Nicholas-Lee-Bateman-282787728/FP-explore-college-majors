2476048,5,B000DZV73G,This movies amazing..The quality is kind of weird and not the best in the world but it's watchable and you'll get used to it and it is in fact the original japanese version with english subititles. Other than that this movie will not be coming to america on dvd soon and I'm glad I had the chance to get it while I had the money. This by far in my opinion is the best of the mothra movies.,1329264000,5,389,4.0

8103057,3,B000DZV73G,"Liked the movie (wife & I have enjoyed most of the Toho offerings), but pretty sure the guy who sold me this copy was wearing an eyepatch..... Quality is pretty bad, subtitles were part of the grainy video, & the ""bunus features"" dvd looks like was printed with lightscribe. Looking forward to the official bluray release with 1/2/3 in one package instead.",1418515200,,356,4.758064516129032

8103061,2,B000DZV73G,"I was happy to see that this movie was released on Amazon, as I have been wanting this one for a while.  According to the specifications, this disk is supposed to be region-free, and thus play on any player.  But when I put it in the player, I found that it would not play, and that it was complaining about the region code.  I was able to play it on my computer, but there are no English features of any sort on the disk - not even subtitles.  I am sure that the movie would be OK, but I cannot tell - I do not speak or read Japanese.",1362009600,3,535,3.8807339449541285

8103064,4,B000DZV73G,"You can watch the English Dub of the Rebirth of Mothra 3 on Crackle.com for FREE until 1/1/13 (you can also watch parts 1 and 2 there). I wanted to watch this with my kids but was never able to find it until it showed up on Crackle.com. I read that there were 7 versions of Mothra in this movie, but really there was only normal Mothra, a forum of Mothra that appears for 1 short non-fighting scene and a new forum of Mothra at the end. If you liked parts 1 and 2, you should like this one to some degree.",1350259200,,505,3.9607843137254903
