Millions of Native Americans succombed to disease and exhaustion, therefore Christianity became the conqueror in their eyes. Their forced acceptance of it was merely superficial while they secretly retained their belief in their old gods and customs. Only very few voices against this genocide were raised in the Christian camp. To protect the native population from the slave hunters, missionaries withdrew with them to isolated reservations. The attempts of individual missionaries to adopt to local traditions were successful on site but ultimately failed because of Roman centralism, which refused to tolerate any adoption. In 1620, the Mayflower landed the Pilgrims on the east coast of North America. The continent received a Calvinist character and became the promised land for immigrants from Europe. Countless Protestant groups branched out farher and farther, mostly practicing peaceful coexistence. This series explores the archeology and origins of Christianity and how it came into the world. Filmed on location in actual historical and biblical sites, this series features many memorable, full-scale dramatic re-creations.""",1260662400,,1314,5.848958333333333
