It was missing some of the polish that more experienced dancers would give, but Malakhov is a superb partner and Ms. Valieva is a very innocent Giselle.  The acting in the first act was good and, for what was probably a first time in major roles, stands up very well.

In the second act, both of the principals give lovely technical performances and their partnering was light and effortless.

Mr. Malakhov was already showing signs of the great dancer he would become.

Worth having if you can get it at a reasonable price.  Don't expect a Bolshoi level performance, but you will enjoy it.",1396569600,,723,4.790322580645161

I enjoyed it and purchased this copy for my daughter.
Recommend dealing with this vendor.",1371600000,,131,4.739130434782608
8036837,4,B0006212T0,"Although this production of Giselle is consdered second-rate, the dancing of award-winning Vladimir Malakhov is definitely first-rate with his phenomonal classical ballet technique and sensitive acting. Do not judge this performance too harshly.",1153785600,3,245,6.454545454545454
8036838,2,B0006212T0,"I must agree with the reviewer Linn on just about all respects. The performance is not bad, nothing is embarassing, but - particularly given the DVD is offerred at full price - one can do much better elsewhere (try the Scala/Ferri at full price, on a budget go for the Boshoi performance, which I'm not crazy about, but it's much better than this one, and about half the price). The technical presentation is rather poor to begin with. Sound quality is quite boxy, and the orchestral performance is quite mediocre to be honest, some really glaring bloopers from the brass section in the music for the nobles, though there is an interesting lift to certain passages, such as the grapepicker's theme. Camera work is amateurish. There is an overuse of the kind of close up filmed performances are obsessed with, and that are most unfortunante in ballet when we do want to see the dancer's feet, after all. As if in response to this, many shots are done from the opposite extreme, as though the camera were placed in the last row of the balcony, seeming a city block away from the stage (not to mention a problem with someone's head passing by the camera a couple of times.) The performers seem uninspired. Malakhov is by far the highlight, and as pointed out, has not yet aquired the polish that might have lent the performance more grace. Much the same can be said for Vasileva, there is a straightforward charm to her characterization, but a sense of insecurity, and a lack of fluidity in Act II, when Giselle needs it the most. I rather liked the Hilareon, though The Russian practice is utilized of featuring him more prominently in the Act one ensembles than is generally seen, and the dancer does not quite seize the opportunity. Someone also needed to take him aside and redo his eye makeup. The physical production does not fare well on camera, it is a touch drab, and a bit cheap looking. Audience response is tepid throughout, and for some reason.

If you found this in an overstock bin, or if it was going for mid-price, this performance might have more going for it, but with the other options available, this is simply not a competetive version.

Wow, you would think I was really cranky today reading this, and I'm not. I guess I just didn't like this one too much.",1116979200,15,2276,4.603448275862069
