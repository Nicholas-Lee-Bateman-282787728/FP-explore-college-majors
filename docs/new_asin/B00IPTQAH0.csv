6285240,5,B00IPTQAH0,"Must see for Ghost in the shell fans!  Watch border one before this!  In Border 2 you see how the major forms her team.  There is action but a bit less.  This Border focuses more on the team, and what they were all doing (mostly together) before the Major recruited them.  There is of course espionage and government secrets about to be revealed but it is not too heavy and does not prevent you from enjoying the story.  You also see the first trace of the ""Ghost"" in the ""Shell"" here, so we see the evolution of the AI and start to understand why this cybernetic consciousness can be such a dangerous thing.  What is this Ghost?  Do all AI have it?  What about organics gone Cybernetic (aside from Ghost pains, explained in Border 1)?  Questions that make you want to go back and watch the entire series all over, but wait for Border 3!",1404604800,,837,4.341935483870968
6285241,5,B00IPTQAH0,"Part two of this prequel series continues to show the Section 9 Special Ops team come together, coalescing around Major Kusanagi.  You don't technically need to watch any more of these than episode 1 and 2  to jump ahead to the rest of the Ghost In The Shell series... but why not watch them all and enjoy watching the human machine come together?  Part of what makes GITS a stand-out series is the effort put into developing the inter-character relationships and motivations, so the more detail you get, the bigger and brighter the overall picture becomes. And the more enjoyable your viewing experience gets.  Episode 2 contains a lot more whizzbang action that will remind you a lot of the best parts of ""The Matrix"".  The motorbikes reminded me of ""Akira"".  This episode has less of the thoughtful, lyrical montage interludes that punctuate much of GITS with artful mood-setting, but there's a lot of exposition to get through here. Overall, quite a satisfactory continuation, well worth a watch.",1404432000,,1000,4.9226190476190474
6285242,4,B00IPTQAH0,"I just watched Border 1 and 2 Back to Back and my only regret is that I don't speak Japanese because I kept having to look away from the animation to read the subtitles.  Excellent story, feels very true to the rest of the rest of the franchise, excellent animation and a very good story.  I recommend this to any GitS fans.  The only thing that keeps me from rating this 5 stars is that while all of the other characters look the same they made to many changes to the way the Major looks.  In the original anime she was an adult woman.  In this they've almost made her into a teenager.",1403481600,2,586,4.150442477876106
6285243,4,B00IPTQAH0,The animation for ghost in shell is so much better then a lot of the shows out there I just wish it had been translated,1402358400,3,119,3.8
6285244,5,B00IPTQAH0,"got a film cell- 5 frames in this one, nice, reminds me of GITS:SAC where each release came with something- tshirt, model, id card etc",1401840000,2,134,4.4
6285245,3,B00IPTQAH0,"The story continues from Border 1, where there are currently just the Major and Aramke(spelling?) building Section 9. They begin to build a team to take down a group of soldiers gone rogue that are trying to reveal an incident from the previous war.

For those that were loyal to the series and have seen every episode of Laughing Man and 2nd Gig, then this movie will probably be a huge let down. It creates a movie untrue to the original series about how the team was created. The original team was created out of a deep respect for the skill of the other members and the team creates an unbreakable bond as they grow and work together. In this movie you never get any of those feelings. The depth of the story is average for any anime, but especially weak compared to previous GitS or even the individual 23 minute episodes that I am use too. There was not too much to figure out, it was just to simple for what GitS is known for. It is a Stand Alone Complex, I was kind of hoping that the 3 prequels would run together a bit more. The animation is average for an anime but lacking for what you expect from Ghost in the Shell. I need more large views of the city and a feeling of an enormous world with slums as well as a vibrant city on the ocean. This movie takes place in mostly confined environments during night. Never much change or deviation. The music just plain sucks compared to the series as well. Lastly, I never feel for the characters and did feel the need to understand their points of view or care.

There were a few good parts to the movie. The mech battle was exciting, similar to 2nd Gig, and the chase scenes were well made, not too long and dragged out but not short either. It was entertaining for the most part and was a mix between 2 and 3 stars for me. For those that have never seen the series then you will probably not understand who is and isn't a cyborg and what is going on with the bodies of people and that they are all connected to the internet. Outside of that, this movie should be pretty easy to pick up and watch without having seen anything else.

Overall I do NOT recommend purchasing it. Wait a year for it to go to Prime or Hulu.",1400457600,13,2174,4.221153846153846

6285247,5,B00IPTQAH0,"If you're a GiTS purest you might have reservations about quite a few aspects of this reboot. However, if you can put aside prejudice for an hour this is a highly entertaining and frankly pretty sick incarnation of Ghost in the Shell.",1399593600,2,234,4.595238095238095
6285248,1,B00IPTQAH0,"What a massive disappointment. I own every GiTS iteration from movies to series and this is garbage. The writing is trite and unimaginative; and the animation is amateurish (as if they let unpaid interns do all the work). Stay away if you are a fan of the series. Perhaps if you don't know any better, you might find it tolerable. Perhaps not.",1399075200,6,343,4.548387096774194
6285249,4,B00IPTQAH0,"Firstly, you can read my review of Arise, Border 1 for my review of this reboot as a whole...so heres the verdict on Border 2:

Ultimately, I was disappointed. I should probably give it 3 stars, but I love GitS too much to knock it that hard.

The good:
-a nice hefty portion of special features, including valuable interviews with the production team and actors, and even silly stuff like a Surface tablet promo knock off commercial just like on regular tv (it was funny in the least)
-the action sequences are lovely as always, and even mirror Hollywood style filming with slo-mo leaps, Bounds, punches and bullets.
-Kise captured the visual beauty of the cyber world when characters are working in each others cyber brains. Very reminiscent of Oshii and his manga (GitS2) and Kamiyama In SAC.
-nice integration of CGI
-a scify esque plot with underlying political tones that engages the brain, true to GitS trhough and through. Considering you know its only 50 mins beforehand, it actually does a decent job giving enough substance while also ending on a zinger (so far, we're doing great. All the checkboxes are filled)

Now the bad:
-so we know its only 50 mins. Now consider it is part 2 of 4 (halfway done); it's current pace is going to fall well short of any ultimate satisfaction to ""pre Section-9"" story material. The notion of paying $50 for two episodes slapped me in the face when it was over and I felt ""come on, I want more than that"". Hoping the pace changes for Border 3 and 4.
-the animation quality was very inconsistent, with action sequences visually stunning, and everything else being average at best. I grew fond of GitS because two reasons, one being high animation quality (other is story, but can't fault the story here)... And it just didn't deliver in that area. You can also tell several still frames were drug out just a tad too long in order to increase film length.
-a key voice actor, Aramaki, was a little too monotone. What happened, the voice performances in Border 1 were great! Now they are only good.
-the only valuable extras (the interviews) have no subs. Won't understand unless you're fluent in Japanese.

Content:
-includes a nice art book with lore and character art
-true scale blu ray quality, simple black bluray case with slip cover, English subs ONLY just like Border 1.

I can say it still balances out though to something watchable (recommend watching Border 1 first), but not worth buying... Unless you're a fan of course. Kise dropped the ball here, but thankfully nothing broke and it hasn't rolled too far away. Yet.

EDIT (4/29/14) - Just noticed Arise is making its way to Amazon Instant Video, and Border 2 would totally be worth an $8 digital purchase vs. $50 if you're sitting on the fence about this (the only extras you might miss is the art book, interviews being untranslated and all, which is not worth the $40+ you'd be saving imo).",1396742400,3,2901,4.67843137254902

6285254,5,B00IPTQAH0,I've seen a lot of mixed reviews about this new OVA. I've really been enjoying this series. They tie in small character quirks that people who have seen SAC or 2ndGIG will understand but still they have a completely new story line. Some of the story contradicts the story of SAC or 2ndGIG but that's not a reason to discredit the excellence of Arise. The story is compelling and so are the action scenes and the music.,1410998400,,418,4.441558441558442

6285257,4,B00IPTQAH0,Same as the first border I really enjoyed it. This border however picks up the pace story-wise and add alittles more action to the mix which was nice and helped move things along.

8644553,5,B00IPTQAH0,"Ok I admit that I was very skeptical of the newest reboot of the franchise, so it took me up to this point to watch. So far I'm intrigued, I love that I can still identify with each of the main character's similarities of the beloved before series (SAC, Sec GiG, and SoildStateSoceity) but with a hole different""feel"" to it.
