8306177,5,B001GMU42A,"This is such an amazing collection of vintage criterion movies. Even though its not ""criterion"" labeled it is steal a better collection then most criterion movie packs out there in the first place. Anyways amazon should really bring this back in stock because people are truly missing out on Jules Dassin's amazing work. I would say the only thing wrong with this piece is that it does not include more movies like Rififi or Topkani aren't in it. Oh well, still skates by as an amazing collection.",1326499200,,497,4.724137931034483
