6412904,5,B00KB3SSAA,"I spent my high school and college DAZE with a few friends who i can call my bests....one of which is Lindsay, or as she is known in the film, Reverie.  I hadnt kept in touch very well throughout life after college...but when I heard she was going on The Adventure that is Appalachian Trail with her boyfriend and their dog...I became extremely excited for them and kept up with the trail day by day as they wrote in their online journal.  Let's just say their film was long awaited!  When I saw it at the SOLD OUT theater in Baton Rouge it touched me.  Adventures are something that take us through peaks and valleys...ups and downs...they are emotional roller coasters and constant changes.  Just watching their struggles and joyous moments made me cry and laugh!  I came out of the theater an emotional wreck!  Coltin (or Spiral) just did an UNBELIEVABLE job of filming and editing the months and months of footage!  The music makes the adventure THAT MUCH more enjoyable and emotional!  It's a collection of beautiful and exciting moments and special and unique people!  I LOVED this film...I cannot wait to get on the Appalachian Trail myself!!!",1399939200,,1150,4.705
6412905,5,B00KB3SSAA,"If you're looking to learn more about the Appalachian Trail, you might go read Bill Bryson's Walk in the Woods or watch the National Geographic... but neither of those will give you insight into what it's like hiking the appalachian trail, day after day, month after month. Climb to Katahdin shows you the joy and strain of committing to the Appalachian Trail... it's essential if you're thinking of hiking the trail. and if you just want to see what the trail is about, this movie will show you what it's like, warts and all. the people who made this movie were totally independent, just went out and did it, and so there is an earnestness and realness to the film, kinda like Les Stroud's survivorman series... the two hikers and their dog are carrying all this camera gear and equipment with them the entire way.",1399939200,,815,4.627586206896551
6412906,4,B00KB3SSAA,"The Climb to Kathdin is more than simply a film about hiking the Appalachian Trial; it shows the inner awakening one experiences while in spending time in nature, and it captures the range of strong emotions that factor into making a 2,000 mile hike through our nation's back country possible.

Calloway's film paints a clear picture of what life on the trail is like, giving viewers an accurate representation of what to expect if they decide to hike their own hike.

I first met Calloway in our shared hometown after reading about his film and as I prepared for an attempted thru-hike on the Pacific Crest Trail. Though I made it only 1,100 of the 2,600 PCT miles, Calloway's personal advice as well as the realities pictured in this film helped prepare me for, and later fondly recall, my time on the trail.

I suspect Calloway's future endeavors in outdoor adventure documentaries will be equally compelling and only improve as his filmmaking talents improve. This movie on the AT is certainly worthwhile, and during a public screening in a Baton Rouge park, a crowd of more than 100 people sure seemed to agree with my thoughts.

6412907,5,B00KB3SSAA,"As owner of multiple trail movies, gotta rate this up there near or at top. Definitely purchase the Blu Ray version to get the full effect. Gives you the real sense of the up and downs of hiking the AT. Bonus, the dog cam gives a whole new perspective.",1399939200,,252,4.163265306122449
6412908,5,B00KB3SSAA,Wonderful movie. It shows how great the trail can be and how brutal it is at times. Makes me want to go hiking now.,1399939200,,115,3.8333333333333335
6412909,5,B00KB3SSAA,"This film gives an excellent telling of the exhilaration and trials when venturing through the vast American landscape. With excellent cinematography and a killer soundtrack, you are thrown into the life of being a thru-hiker on the Appalachian Trail. This film really captures the community of the Appalachian Trail. Throw in some 'trail magic', the occasional 'trail angel' to guide you along the way, and an adorable love story and you have a unique account of what it's like to leave the norm behind and to find your own path.",1399939200,,530,4.9
6412910,5,B00KB3SSAA,"How amazing and truly inspiring it is to see these individuals face these endeavors with raw courage, passion, and persistence. Many of us will only dream about accomplishing such an amazing feat! This film is near and dear to my heart. In addition to the beautiful film clips and wonderful narration throughout, the music score/soundtrack is quite impressive! I highly recommend giving this film the opportunity to inspire YOU, too! Way to go crew! Brilliant.",1399939200,,460,5.1466666666666665
6412911,5,B00KB3SSAA,"This film is AMAZING. I can't say anything negative about it. The scenery and camaraderie are fabulous. While watching the movie, you feel like you are hiking with them. People say pictures don't do the trail justice so I can only imagine what it looks like in person. This film makes you want to put on your hiking boots and hit the closest trail! A JOB WELL DONE! I am a lover of music and the background music is great as well!",1399939200,,430,4.2560975609756095
6412912,4,B00KB3SSAA,The Climb to Katahdin captures the true essence of life on the Appalachian Trail. Coltin and his crew show the trials and tribulations A.T. Thru-hikers face on their trek from Georgia to Maine. Well done!,1399939200,,204,4.857142857142857
6412913,5,B00KB3SSAA,"Words can't describe how much this film has meant to me, especially since I was one of those who hiked in 2012. The dedication and hard work that Coltin has put into this film is incredible. Everything I have been missing about the trail is fulfilled and completely restored in my mind after watching this. I loved everything about their adventure and am honored to know many of the people in this film and behind the making of it! If you are thinking about hiking the Appalachian Trail you must watch this! You will want to go out afterwords and start your hike immediately :)",1399939200,,577,4.504761904761905
6412914,4,B00KB3SSAA,"this movie is super inspiring! will make you want to strap on a pack and go. great cinematography captures the beauty of the environment. editing and soundtrack are fantastic! just needs more cam dog, four stars",1399939200,,211,4.888888888888889
6412915,5,B00KB3SSAA,"Ahhhh the memories. I just relived 6 months of my life.

This video shows you the trials and tribulations of the AT in a way no other AT video that I've seen and I've seen then all. It shows not only what the normal life day to day is for hikers, not just the stars, but you get to know a ton of famous faces from the class of '12.

For me, this even beats the joy on VHS, North to Katahdin. Seriously, very well done to the maker of this video for the monumental amount of work it must have taken to put this together.

I hiked in 2012. I knew a lot of the folks in this video and I wish I could relive it.

While watching it I smiled, cried out, screamed, loved, basked in and regretted things on trail, and it even brought me to tears. Basically I totally relived the trail by watching it and I'm going to be forever grateful for having it to bring home what happened between April and September 2012!

Thanks",1399939200,,912,4.044444444444444
8657196,5,B00KB3SSAA,"Wow! The ultimate adventure movie! When I watched this for the first time I was plunged into the full range of emotion. I laughed with Spiral, cried with Chaser, and fell in love Revirie. This film is a must have for anyone thinking about hiking the trail. I keep it on a constant loop in my blu ray player to remind myself that beyond these four walls theres a wild wild world out there!",1422230400,,388,4.256756756756757
8657197,5,B00KB3SSAA,"As someone who has never attempted a hike of this magnitude, I was wildly impressed and incredibly inspired by Lindsay and Coltin's grand adventure. The film was an excellent representation of AT life. Gorgeous nature; unique, beautiful and honest people; raw adventure and the coolest dog ever are what set this film apart. I highly recommend this film to anyone yearning to experience the amazing nature of the AT. Not to mention, the cover art is incredible.",1421625600,,461,5.0
8657198,5,B00KB3SSAA,"I have several trail movies, this one rates up there at the top. I have watched this film at least 20 times now. Gives you the real sense of what it would be like to hike the AT.  Also have to say I really like the dog cam. Being a dog person, I really enjoyed the footage. I highly recommend this film to anyone into hiking or the outdoors.",1418601600,,341,3.9420289855072466
8657199,5,B00KB3SSAA,"Ive seen this movie several times and honestly I wouldn't mind watching it 100 more times. This AT documentary is about a couple and their mighty traildog who somehow steals the show from everyone. Anyone that has a love of the trail and the outdoors will love this film. It has everything you want in a documentary without an angle which is an achievement upon itself.
I feel like I could write a book about what I think about this film. There are so many incredble scenes and subtle nuances that you more than likely miss some in your fist sitting. I can not proclaim highly enough how much material is in this film and how it has a higher replayability then any movie that I have ever seen.
Do yourself a favor and buy this movie. I can guarantee that you will take something away from it.",1400112000,,792,4.358108108108108
8657200,5,B00KB3SSAA,"I bought this thinking that my husband and I would enjoy it together...however, my children (ages ten and twelve) were immediately lured in as well. It may have been the dog carrying the camera that sparked their interest at first, but they were captivated by the entire story. Very enjoyable. I am recommending this to my teacher friends for the classroom. I'm not saying that it is a ""kids film"", but great for all ages. Very inspirational.",1400112000,,442,4.753246753246753
8657201,5,B00KB3SSAA,"This film is terrific! I expected it to be a small independent film from an outdoor enthusiast.  The quality, and editing were amazing. It was a perfect mix of serious and humor.",1400025600,,178,4.5625
8657202,4,B00KB3SSAA,This movie shows what it feels like to hike the AT. It's a unique and important film and I wish other AT documentaries took this approach.,1400025600,,138,4.346153846153846
8657203,5,B00KB3SSAA,"The photography along with the story are nothing shy of amazing.  I had the privilege of hiking during the same period as this was shot so memories came flooding back as I sat back and watched..  Friends and family have asked me what the trail was like, now I can show them. Anyone who has any interest in either the Appalachian Trail itself or in the people who venture forth onto it each year should watch this movie.",1400025600,,419,4.358974358974359
8657204,5,B00KB3SSAA,"Honestly? I went in expecting to see hand-cam video of trees, trails, and people in tents. I was absolutely floored by the end of this, and could not have been more wrong. Coltin offers a unique perspective of a well-worn trail, and the struggles that come with not only mastering it, but doing it with a dog and a girlfriend. This story is a celebration of camaraderie, perseverance, and yes....love. Beautiful visuals really pop...he does some amazing things considering the little equipment he had to drag all the way up from Louisiana to Katahdin. A worthy 5 stars.",1399939200,2,569,4.816326530612245
8657205,5,B00KB3SSAA,"It's so hard to write a meaningful review and avoid ""spoiler alerts"" but suffice it to say - this is an excellent documentary. I fancy myself as a bit of a collector of these stories/documentaries and this is the best one I've seen of the AT. If you're a diehard AT fan then you'll enjoy the familiar locations, events, people, and nuances of a thru-hike. If you're completely new to thru-hiking then you'll get a well rounded view of what the AT has to hold.

Everyone's experience is unique - and I love how these two made the experience their own. They weren't hell-bent on following perfectly in the footsteps of those that came before them. They were on the trail to discover...to learn...and to see what the journey had in store for them...and I really feel that's the key to a successful hike no matter the distance. It's not so much about the destination, as it is the journey.

I can't speak for the DVD, but the blu-ray is breathtaking. Excellent footage and stunning images. The whole documentary is professionally and excellently produced. I highly recommend it!",1399939200,,1074,4.707446808510638
