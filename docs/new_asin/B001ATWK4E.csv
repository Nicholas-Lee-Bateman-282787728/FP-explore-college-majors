3467241,1,B001ATWK4E,"As funny as the first movie was, this one was just awful. About 15 minutes in, I realized just how bad it was going to be and it never got better. The sad part is I was so excited for this movie to come out!

The dialogue is awful. The eye candy is there, but it's just too silly. Another review says ""it is what it is"" and I completely agree. Thumbs way down.",1228694400,8,360,3.864864864864865
3467242,1,B001ATWK4E,"Perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Not much else to say.  Terrible plot, terrible jokes (to the point that they even ruin the raunchy humor and render it un-funny).  And to add a fat annoying turd on top of an incredibally nasty sundae would be Perez Hilton is littered throughout the movie.  What more is there to say?  DON'T SEE IT!!!  It's not even one of those really bad movies that people talk about where you want to see just how bad it is (the kind of bad that it's almost funny).  This is just bad.",1228608000,5,521,4.202020202020202
3467243,3,B001ATWK4E,"It's Spring Break time, and Andy, Griff, Nico, and Jarod are back.  (Actually, as the film pokes fun at in its first sequence, they are  now portrayed by different actors, except for Joseph Blechman returning as Nico from the original ""Another Gay Movie."")  They decide to head cross country to Fort Lauderdale for a ""Gays Gone Wild"" party, with a prize for the one who ""scores"" with the most guys.  Griff and Jarod are now a couple, so they are carefully testing the waters as to how much outside ""fun"" they can have, without ruining their relationship. Andy immediately meets a sweet, cute guy, Luis, who doesn't believe in casual sex, while Nico is ... well ... Nico, more nelly than ever, but his natural shyness and lack of confidence put him at a disadvantage with that horny and aggressive crowd. It's a week of crazy events, MC'd by RuPaul and Lady Bunny, with some people in costumes, zombies invading the bathhouse, Nico's discovery of a cute mer-man (Brent Corrigan) and a musical salute to water sports.

It is easily more than twice as ""rude and crude"" as the original film, and - in my opinion - not anywhere near as clever.  And that's a shame, because he was on to something good with the first film.  Writer/director Todd Stephens instead went with an extended scene of three characters vomiting on each other, as well as the graphic results of silicone cement added to a tube of lube. Yes, it is hysterical in many other places, and even the gross humor will likely get a laugh, but I found it tedious and disappointing, by comparison to the first film.  DVD has numerous extras, including deleted scenes, how they did Brent's mer-man suit, and a music video with guest star Perez Hilton.

How do you rate a film where it seems obvious that the writer/director was INTENDING to make little more than 90 minutes of gross-out humor and simulated sex scenes barely laced together by a trite, simplistic plot with eye-rolling dialogue by a cast busy chewing the scenery?  I've seen reviews from one to five stars on this, and it largely depends on the point of view of the reviewer. As a serious film, it would be a one-star, but it does succeed in providing a heaping helping of gutter humor while simultaneously kicking the legs out from those pearl-clutching members of our community who are always screaming about ""stereotypical depictions"" in gay films.  This film is absolutely not for them.  Overall, I'll give it three lube-stained stars out of five.",1228435200,23,2472,4.709976798143852
3467244,1,B001ATWK4E,"Save yourself the grief, rent it, if you absolutely must, but don't buy it. NOTHING at all like the first one. Bad sets, bad acting and almost a whole new cast. It lost the charm & the humor, and they substituted it with a very ill looking RuPaul in he/she drag, and the obnoxious, overated, hard to look at Perez Hilton. The only good thing about this movie is the return of Jonah Bleckman, who cant even save the movie, because it is just not funny! Just skip over this one, your not missing anything at all.",1228262400,8,510,4.268041237113402

3467275,2,B001ATWK4E,"Another Gay Movie was awesome. Another Gay Sequel was the opposite of awesome. Only one of the original four characters returned, and it was the one I liked the least. The way they explained away the change in cast was stupid. Seriously, if you're going to replace the vast majority of the original cast, don't even bother making a sequel, because it doesn't feel anything like the first movie. Most of the replacement cast didn't even look anything like the original cast.

The first movie had me laughing and even had some heart warming moments. With Another Gay Squeal, I think I laughed once during the entire movie. I recommend watching the first one, but taking a pass on this one.",1396224000,,687,4.677685950413223

3467282,1,B001ATWK4E,"This movie taught me one thing - check the reviews first!

I like ""Another Gay Movie"" quite a bit, so when I ordered it on Amazon the other night and saw ""Sequel"" was available, too, I ordered it as well without even looking.  Big mistake - ""Another Gay Sequel"" is absolutely terrible, and nothing like the original.  It doesn't even feature the original cast, outside of Jonah Blechman reprising his Nico character and Scott Thompson as Andy's father.  Allegedly, the rest of the cast were afraid of being stereotyped, but it's more likely that they just read the script.  The original cast made their characters likable, but their replacements completely fail to do the same (and I don't think the terrible script is completely to blame.)

The movie simply is not funny - at all - and is actually disgusting at times.  It's hard to believe that Todd Stephens is responsible for both films.",1376956800,,891,4.746753246753247

3467296,1,B001ATWK4E,"Like many gay themed movies the cast changed heavily which was disappointing, but the new actors did well. The whole movie was a series of commercials for several gay themed products; literally looking into the camera to talk about the products and services. It was in character and campy, which is to be expected from the movie, but it was still WAY WAY WAY too much. All the jokes were way to much. There is a scene with violent vomiting that went on for too long, I actually had to fast forward through it. It was unnecessarily too long. The campiness prevents the movie from being anything other than a joke of film- you can't get into the characters or have an appreciation for them. Niko's watersports ballet was very well done.",1359331200,,734,4.568181818181818

3467316,2,B001ATWK4E,"I enjoyed the first film, Another Gay Movie, a raunchy sex-romp by and for gay men. The sequel is a thorough train wreck, sad to say. Only two of the original actors return, Jonah Blechman as Nico and Scott Thompson as Andy's Dad. The other 3 ""friends"" of Niko are played by different actors. I laughed at the jab by Nico's mom about actors not returning to gay roles so they aren't thought to be gay...but after watching the entire film I think they did the right thing. (Note: The original actresses who played Nico's Mom and Muffster make cameo appearances in the beginning scene but I'm not counting them as returning actors)

The basic storyline is pretty thin with the 4 boys heading to Ft. Lauderdale for Spring Break. They then compete in a contest of who can have sex the most times (I won't type the term they use in the film, in case any underage readers see this). Mostly tired jokes with a few original laughs. The only character you really feel for is Nico (played to the hilt by Jonah Blechman) but even he can't carry the thin script. Plot holes and disjointed scenes leave this movie feeling more like a bad sketch comedy show.

The acting ranges from fair to bad (Perez Hilton? Are you serious? Talk about stunt casting). The only reason I gave this film 2 stars is there are some great bodies to look at. If Amazon allowed me to rate by the half-star I would have dropped it to 1 and a half because of Perez.

The most amazing part is that the same write/director/producer, Todd Stephens, was involved here. The first film was no Casablanca, but it was enjoyable...you cared for the characters and laughed at the jokes. This time around you can feel them trying too hard to make us care and laugh. Giant pubic lice? A watersports dance number? Gratuitous vomit scene? It might have been funny with the right script, but even if the original actors all came back to their roles, I don't think they could have saved this film. I watched the making of feature on the DVD and could tell Todd had his heart and soul in this project and loved doing it, but it just goes to prove lightning doesn't strike twice.",1246924800,,2123,4.4524421593830334

I have a hard time believing the filmmakers couldn't think of anything better.  This movie is just plain AWFUL!  The charm that the main characters had is completely gone in favor of giant crabs (complete with an animated musical revue), an ode to ""golden showers"", zombies in a bath house, and incredibly tacky product placements and plugs galore.  The plot is practically non-existent, the sex and nudity are not sexy (even though the actors are quite beautiful), and the campiness is so overdone it's embarassing.  Basically, this movie does everything wrong.  I feel bad for RuPaul and Perez Hilton, who had such prominent roles in such a terrible movie (this movie is right up Lady Bunny's alley, however).

(which according to the commentary was an homage to Carrie with the crazy mom).

We have a few surprises on the film, a musical act about whiz and non stopping sexual jokes but some of the extra elements were distracting,while Rupaul shines on screen, Perez Hilton could be easily removed from the film, his whole part was idiotic.

3467338,4,B001ATWK4E,"After the success of ""Another Gay Movie"" (and the boys' closing toast ""to the sequel""), it was almost inevitable that writer/director/producer Todd Stephens would pack Andy, Nico, Jarod & Griff off to college for more sexcapades. Opening with a satirical wink to ""The Wizard of Oz""--with Nico as Dorothy, natch!--the regular players from the original return. Nico's giggly, slightly loopy Mom makes a cameo (""Some actors were afraid to return, afraid to be typecast as gay. Isn't that silly?""), as well as Muffler, whose boisterous presence is sorely missed in the film. Jonah Blechman returns as the flamboyant Nico, but the other three are replaced by new faces who are just as cute & appealing as the originals.
Flown to Ft. Lauderdale on Spring break to participate in the ""Gays Gone Wild"" contest--the guy who gets laid the most is the winner--the boys go up against a gay clique calling themselves ""the Jaspers"", the embodiment of all that is evil with gay cliques. The contest forms each boys' problematic subplots: Andy meets the boy of his dreams, a sexy (and virginal) Latino named Luis; Jarod & Griff test the boundaries of their relationship based upon ground rules; and Nico embraces his queerness (his odd & unique personality, not his sexuality!).
There are twice as many quest stars as the first: Drag queens RuPaul & Sandi Cove; Porn stars Colton Ford (in a ""sticky"" tryst with Jarod & Griff), the adorable Brent Corrigan as ""Stan the Merman"", and the darkly hunky Michael Lucas as the pizzaboy who REALLY delivers; and Perez Hilton (as a ""born-again"" gay) and the cute Jim Verraros (as a sinful young priest).
It's apparent that Stephens tries to pull out all the stops in this sequel...but is it too much? It depends on your taste & degree of humor. I found such trappings as Nico's musical homage to ""golden showers"" cute and enormous genital crabs funny, but the projectile vomiting scene was a bit too gross.
To me, AGS was a notch below the original because it commits the sin of most sequels: It's so excessive & far reaching that it sometimes smothers the charm of what the original accomplished. Still, I applauded such moments as Andy listening to his heart and abandoning his slutty behavior so he could be with Luis, or felt for Jarod's & Griff's dilemma of experimenting while staying faithful to each other.
In spite of its flaws, it's an enjoyable outing, and just as crude & funny as the original.",1230768000,11,2430,4.815789473684211

Unfortunately, this movie has little to no charm at all- in a lot of ways, it's just stupid.  A lot of it is just promotional spots for a lot of the sponsors of the movie.  And, even though several of the actors are cute, they mostly come off as caricatures and just overact like crazy. Maybe they need to try the method 'less is more'.  Personally, the main character Nico is just plain annoying.  I don't mind characters that are a bit nelly, but for God's sake, find a little testosterone at least! And Perez Hilton can just go the f#ck away!  It's really just disappointing- the premise is not bad, but the execution just sucks.

""Another Gay Sequel"" is much, much worse.  Jonah Blechman, the only returning actor from the original, is also a producer on this film.  Would that he stayed behind the camera.  As in the first, Blechman's character is unfunny and irritating.  Also, the abundance of grossout jokes is taken to the extreme, some of them making me wonder if this film is being subversively anti-gay.  And hey look, it's Perez Hilton, stopping the film dead every time he appears.  And he appears far too often.  You can almost see the flop sweat on the film.

It really says something when the best performance in the film is given by a gay porn star in a small role.  No, I'm not talking about Colton Ford who should have stopped once he got naked. It's Brent Corrigan who, in the role of a merman, manages to be as cute as a button and sweet.
