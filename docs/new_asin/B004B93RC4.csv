4313984,5,B004B93RC4,"Louis CK has been my fav comedian for a LONG time. I kinda thought that this wouldn't be too funny cause he has had so many other funny DVDs & Shows, but he didn't disappoint. The joke about the beautiful couple that he saw had me in tears laughing! Any comedy DVD from him is a good purchase. Chewed Up, Shameless, This...It doesn't matter. They're all comedy gold to me.",1295308800,,372,4.328571428571428
4313985,5,B004B93RC4,"One of the best comedy specials ever made, AND it makes you think about things in a refreshing new way.  Not only is it unbelievable funny, there are parts that are so brilliant, it actually changed my perspective on life.  Everybody should see this.",1295049600,,250,4.659090909090909
4313986,5,B004B93RC4,"An amazing show. In my opinion compares favorably to the best (including Hicks, Carlin, Bruce, Pryor etc). While his language and jokes are not usually for the faint of heart, something (compassion?) seems to allow him to push only to the exact razor's edge of mean-spiritedness before pulling back long enough to deliver another perfectly measured line. I've honestly never reviewed anything before, but this special was literally so funny that it made me lose my mind. I truly hope that he continues to improve, because this show is his best and most consistent by far.",1294963200,26,571,4.958333333333333
4313987,5,B004B93RC4,Excellent Stand Up DVD! Louis CK is the best in the business right now! Just has a great way of looking at social issues! And this DVD is ~30 minutes longer than the version that airs on tv! great stuff!,1294963200,,203,4.1
4313988,5,B004B93RC4,"Louis is amazing, and is probably the best stand-up working today, with Eddie Izzard and Billy Connolly tied for second.  At the moment.  What he does that's so incredible is he throws out his entire set once a year, and starts over.  So this film is a record of his 2009 material.  Each year's stuff gets better and better, and gets stepped up a notch.  I saw him live a few weeks ago, doing the 2010 act (called ""Word,"") and it was even better.  His is a brilliant, beautiful mind, and it's a pleasure to follow it wherever it goes.",1293321600,6,534,4.29
4313989,5,B004B93RC4,"Probably his best special since Shameless, which is my all time favorite of his.
The passing of George Carlin left a huge void in the world.  and the closest we will ever probably have to another Carlin is Louis C.k.

While Carlin would have a focus on the life of politics, Louis has a focus on the politics of life.
One of the most amazing aspects of this special and all of his specials is how effortless he makes his act look.  Quite possible the hardest working man in comedy today.  But you will never notices these things while watching this special, because you'll be too busy laughing your ass right off.

A must own for any fan of stand-up.  Yet another true stand-up classic, that I would gladly put up against any other before it.  Shameless, Chewe Up and now Hilarious are all prime examples of what great comedy is, as well as a hope for what it will be in the future.  The man continue to crate work that makes my life more enjoyable.",1291852800,50,949,4.3522727272727275

4313997,5,B004B93RC4,"With every video or installment of Louie, I am more and more awed at Louis C K's ability to make me laugh out loud.  Outside of the TV,  I watch most videos and binge watching past seasons of Louie on a pad.  I feel like I'm at a personal show.  He is so ribald, and almost all bald!  His humor is observational with a twist, he's totally un-PC.  He jokes about his children as most parents do.  But he uses language you could never say out loud but, sure as hell, many of us think!  His view of the world and his acknowledgement of his shortcomings are the most Hilarious I've ever heard.

You owe it to yourself to watch his videos, his series or, best of all, see him in person.  Louis CK is brilliantly funny, wise and thoughtful.  You will enjoy him so much!!",1434412800,2,764,4.164383561643835

Louis C K is funny because he talks about everyday stuff. He doesn't create elaborate set ups for low payoff jokes. He makes fun of the dumb stuff we all do. That's his genius.

If the F word offends you, Louis C K will make your head explode, so do yourself a favor and just skip his comedy rather than watch it and then come here to write how bad his foul language is in your review. Just save the time and skip the lecture. If you're not a stick in the mud, watch Louis C K. This special is appropriately named 'Hilarious'

He also shares his life, mistakes & dreams in a relatable funny way. There's no way I can relay to you in words just how clever he is with his timing & irreverent witt.

I get that standup is all about insulting everybody you possibly can, but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect at least a modicum of class.  Clearly ""C.K."" doesn't have any.  He's actually worse than crude, he's like that guy you know that starts telling crude jokes and everyone starts laughing until they figure out the guy is really just sick.

I thought there were some real ethical undertones which I could relate to, and he did it in a really hilarious way (for some that is... for some it seems not to be their cup of tea).",1404432000,4,572,4.229357798165138

Gross ! I don't get why some comics think they have to be vulgar and nasty to get people to laugh.  Sad....

While Cosby did so in a ""G"" rated manner, Louis C.K. does similar stuff in an off the boards ""R"" rated way. It fits the modern way of life, and to my ears it's not offensive, it's just the way the current generation gets its point across! I recommend this to anybody who won't be offended by the F-bomb being used...it's there, no way around it.

4314668,5,B004B93RC4,"I've been a big fan of Louis CK since around 2002, when Comedy Central aired his half-hour special, which I thought was really funny.  He's come a long way since then, and this is his best performance, including the new Oh, My God that came out in 2013.  Shameless was an amazing performance as well.  Pretty much everything he's done since 2006 has been fantastic, but this is his masterpiece.  I don't know if he'll ever be able to top this.  But his newer material since then is still very cutting edge and he reminds me of Carlin and Hicks combined.  Sure, he may swear quite a bit, and some of his jokes are just so wrong, but they are so funny in the context in which he brings to them.  There are so many great tracks and he proves once again he is at the top of his game here.  He's finally gotten into the upper-echelon of comedians, like Seinfeld, Hicks, Carlin, Pryor, etc.  He is fearless, says exactly what is on his mind, which is what makes him so funny.  His inspiration came from Carlin, and it shows in this performance.  While he may never match the greatness of Carlin, he will always be seen as in the same league, because he is simply Hilarious.",1367539200,,1167,4.331797235023042

4314684,4,B004B93RC4,"Louis CK's standup act is considerably raunchier than his tv show.  You will like this show.  It is impossible not to like it but if you love his tv show, as I do, it lacks the more subtle comic stylings of his tv show.  This is much broader humor.  Also, where Louis CK is strongest to me is in his observations about human nature, his daughter, his dating, his friends and so forth.  He is less funny to me when he gets going about the more obvious raunch that is familiar to stand up audiences.  I actually like him better than George Carlin though, who was the undisputed king of what Louis CK does in his standup act. So if you are looking for a replacement for the late Carlin, you've found him.

This show is called hilarious because he really resents how the word hilarious has now become apt to describe just about any situation in life.  Formerly this word was used only to describe something very, very funny.  Louis CK's resentments of this change are the comic stylings of his which I prefer.

Of course comedy is subjective, but being that I can appreciate almost any comedian, at least somewhat, Louis C.K. is in a class by himself. His show Louie on FX is one of the funniest on TV.

If you've liked his previous DVDs like ""Chewed Up"" or the classic ""Shameless"" you won't want to miss this one. 5 stars.",1299283200,,456,4.252873563218391
4314711,5,B004B93RC4,Louie is the funniest American comedian alive today!!! And this dvd is Louie at his finest!  It's worth the money...the part about not hitting your kids should be given to ALL new parents!!! This will totally make you LOL!!!!!!,1296864000,,227,4.82051282051282
4314712,3,B004B93RC4,"This is an OK performance by Louis CK. It falls short of some of his better work. If you haven't seen ""Chewed Up"" and ""Shameless"" not to mention a lot of stuff you can find on Youtube, start there first. ""Chewed Up"" and ""Shameless"" will have you rolling with laughter through the entire performance. I found myself not laughing as much or as hard with ""Hilarious"" which is a shame because I was looking forward to this for a long time. It definitley has its moments and he is still a brilliant comedian in this. I would prefer ""Hilarious"" over almost any other comedians performance, but it falls just sub-par for Louis in my opionion.",1296691200,8,635,4.530434782608696
4314713,4,B004B93RC4,"It was a little unfortunate... because we all so much enjoyed Louis' animated humor surrounding his children.  He filmed this at an emotional juncture in his life, and the kind of dark feeling really is pervasive throughout the special.  It kind of reminds me of ""funny guys"" where Adam Sandler stands up and does a really depressing number at a comedy club (and everyone is looking around like, ""really?"").  It is entertaining, but just... a little dark.  I miss the light hearted Louis.  I hope he gets happy again so we can see more of his talent.",1296604800,3,550,4.628865979381444
4314714,3,B004B93RC4,"I'm pretty surprised to see all the 5 star reviews of this special, because for me, it was ok. Louis CK is an extremely funny dude, but I felt this material was a bit raw. It's like he had the outline for a good show, solid topics and all, but then just went on stage and was winging it. The setups were there, but when it came time for the punchline, it just didn't pop. An example from the beginning of the show was the Hitler vs Ray Charles comparison. That had SO much potential, and it was kind of funny, but he could have done more with it. Some jokes had my dying, but most of the special seemed to drag. An hour and 24 mins is a LONG special too, so that could be part of the problem. That's a ton of time to fill. I'd much rather a comedian do a shorter set and have me rolling the whole time, than give me an hour plus of OK material.

If you already like Louis CK, its worth checkin out, but don't expect to be blown away. If you are knew to him, start with ""Shameless"" - that special is top-notch.",1296259200,7,1009,3.9704433497536944
4314715,5,B004B93RC4,"I think Louis CK is this generations best comic. His TV shows are the best on the air, and once again, his stand-up delivers a one-two knockout.  I don't really know how to describe his comedy other than relate it to a tsunami of laughter. It starts out with a small laugh, inside, then a chuckle, then as his performance goes on, you laugh out loud, then get belly laughs and you literally fall on the floor laughing...all the while feeling a little bit guilty for laughing at the words coming out of his mouth. He is HILARIOUS. And I mean it, Louis~",1296172800,16,551,4.349514563106796
4314716,5,B004B93RC4,"I have seen Chewed Up and Shameless, as well as the Louie show. I can't decide which stand-up is the funniest, because I can still watch and recall the prior ones and even now I still laugh. Louis CK's humor is the kind where, after you watch it, you not only find yourself telling other people to go and see it, but you continue to laugh years later. It's that funny.",1295827200,,368,4.197183098591549
