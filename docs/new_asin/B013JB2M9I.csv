7367517,4,B013JB2M9I,"An intense rare gem of a film.

Watching this film, you get insight to the three main characters.

Pommie - This intensely violent, silent and intense man, whose entire being was changed by meeting Sparra.

Sparra aka Merv - An damaged young man, desperate to find shelter, care and love wherever and whenever he could find it, but quick to leave his past behind, whenever it was too inconvenient or hard for him to face.

The fiance - She has a very hard road/journey to deal with during the aftermath. Does Merv really love her or is she and what she represents is what he needs to move beyond his past?",1449446400,5,605,4.423423423423423
7367518,5,B013JB2M9I,Loved this one! A subtle & absorbing relationship drama and a hot thriller. Enjoyed everything that was happening in the spaces between - people & (beautifully designed) spaces. Great dark psychological thriller.  10/10,1449273600,7,219,5.636363636363637

7367520,5,B013JB2M9I,"I was already a fan of Sullivan Stapleton from ""Blindspot,"" but now know him as a really flexible and incredible actor, as the guy you REALLY don't want to mess with, in Cut Snake. This is well-written and directed thriller, with never a dull moment of suspense and action.

7367523,5,B013JB2M9I,"I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Sullivan Stapleton is a first-rate actor. Up until I saw this film, I was only familiar with his work in the exciting STRIKE BACK. Since then I have seen more of his work, which reinforces what I wrote about his acting ability above.

Only problem with this DVD is that it does not have any extra features. Normally this would not bother me, but I had a hell of a time trying to understand the Australian slang spoken in the movie. If the film, at least, had English SUBTITLES, perhaps I would have enjoyed it more the first time I saw it. Not for nothing, but not everyone is familiar with the way Australians in certain regions of that country speak... To not make it easier for those that do not reside there to understand what is being said, is a big disservice to them.

To the DVD distributors Please take note of this fact when releasing similar DVDs in the future.

P.S. Someone complained about the drag performers in the cabaret scene at the beginning of the film.  Please GET OVER IT!  Female impressionists are a fact of life in the World today.  Apparently in the film, the only social gathering place in that remote section of Australia was a gay cabaret that catered to EVERYONE regardless of sexual predilection.. What is so objectionable about that?",1477180800,2,1310,4.553191489361702

7367541,5,B013JB2M9I,"This film will have you on the edge of your seat for all 90 minutes of it. You know something bad is about to happen and you brace yourself for it, but you never know what's coming. That in itself is pretty rare in film these days, when most of the time it seems like you're watching a movie you've already seen. Another thing I like about this story is that when it starts out you think you identify with one character and somewhere along the way you start to feel different and the perspective you had is altered. As the story unfolds you change your allegiance again, and then again. I am completely in love with Sullivan Stapleton so by me he can do no wrong anyway. But even objectively speaking, I think anyone who knows him as Damien Scott or Kurt Weller is in for a surprise as this talented actor reveals numerous facets of himself as ""Pommie"", that may have been previously unknown. He is wounded, yet intense, charming and scary all rolled into one. The film is full of intimate scenes most of which are played out by two characters at a time, no big noisy action you standby and watch but rather intense moments where you feel like you're right there in the car or in the room with them. The costumes, props, cars...an incredible collection that places you perfectly in the exact place and time of the story. Well done to all the professionals involved in making this film.",1462579200,7,1385,4.435294117647059

7367543,2,B013JB2M9I,"I found this movie for the most part to be quite boring, set in the 1970's didn't really add anything to the storyline, they might have well just set in the modern day. The premise should have made for a lot more exciting film than is ultimately delivered. It's not that the actors, especially the main three do a bad job or anything, it's just there isn't a great storyline for them to work with. An ex con has moved on from his past, he's got a working class job, he's met a nice girl, he's proposed to her, she's said yes, he's got a loan and is paying off a house, but then his cell mate shows up and expects their relationship to pick up where it left off. The ex con hasn't told the fiancee anything about what he did in prison to survive and the man he did it to who protected him for four years. He hasn't even told her he was in prison. So what's he to do?

As I said the movie was a bit boring. I was really expecting something a lot better to emerge throughout the movie's duration than ever did. The ending wasn't that realistic. I found the most interesting thing about the film to be a restaurant in one scene that is designed with its kitchen between the tables and the toilets so you have to work through the kitchen to go. Sure I guess the 70's were a bit freer in thinking, but that just doesn't seem like something that would work if you were trying to prepare food.",1457568000,,1385,4.12962962962963
7367544,5,B013JB2M9I,"After watching Sullivan Stapleton act in Blindspot and Strike Back, his performance in Cut Snake is  impressive. The last scene made me feel his  anguish and despair. Well done Mr. Stapleton.",1457481600,,191,5.129032258064516
7367545,5,B013JB2M9I,"Sullivan Stapleton's performance is the kind they refer to as ""brave"" very much against type in some ways and not in others.  I really don't like to pepper my reviews with spoilers or spoiler alerts so here goes.  This is a gritty 70's styled crime drama with some strong violence, even stronger emotions and loads of believable and terrific acting.  This is NOT Strike Back , so those hoping for a fix of that will  be, and judging by reviews ,have been disappointed.  For me it is one of my favorite films of the year with a challenging story, good action, and most of all truly fleshed out characters not stereotypical Hollywood cliches.  This is an Australian production and top notch.  Highly Recommended.  I wish the Blu ray came with special features and it is a bit high priced AND ... made to order.... all would combine to deduct a star for me if Stapleton wasn't so riveting and the movie so strong.",1456358400,6,910,4.539877300613497

7367554,2,B013JB2M9I,"This is one of those crime thriller dramas I couldn't get into as much as everyone else. The story develops slow and the plot reveals itself slow so consider this your warning for early plot spoilers.

In 1974, Jim Stewart (Sullivan Stapleton) gets out of prison and goes looking for his old friend Merv Farrell (Alex Russell). Merv has moved on and is engaged to Paula (Jessica De Gouw) having started a new life. Jim's presence is disruptive. He doesn't trust him around Paula, and as the plot reveals itself, the two were very close cell mates. Jim returns to what he knows and drags his reluctant buddy into it.

While you can feel the angst and intensity, I was not being entertained. The premise and antics were dull considering today's films. The female impersonators really didn't add anything.

Very few films have ever hit me this hard ... 'Umberto D.' was probably the first, and 'Maria Full of Grace' and 'City of God' would be among the few others.  Yes, ""Cut Snake"" is in that category of mind-blowing, changes-your-world films ... not something you would ever expect from a hardcore crime drama.  Honor, betrayal, courage, love, sacrifice and redemption ... all the big themes of great literature and great cinema are stuffed into this little-known Indie gem from down under.

7367558,2,B013JB2M9I,"I can not explain all the 5 star reviews!  This is not a very good movie unless, perhaps, you are one with shallow interests who is also caught up in the vile counter-productive current conflicts over gay lifestyles: a beyond confrontational homosexual ""activist"" or a bleeding heart liberal who weeps over the passion of their pugnacious words.  Poor acting, poor direction and a mediocre, poorly developed script presenting a dull story that has been told a hundred times before much better (and frequently appreciated by me).  I think watching this movie, waiting for it to get better, was just a miniscule bit better than watching paint dry.  This is the 21st century cinematic equivalent of pulp magazines in the early 20th century.",1452038400,,737,5.016393442622951

7367560,5,B013JB2M9I,"I had seen the various trailers for this film on Youtube and was very excited to see Sullivan Stapleton in a very different role to the one I was most familiar with him in 'Strike Back'. This film is set in 1974, a time that I am at an age to remember vividly - and it is set in Australia. There are three main characters in the film, Sparra, Paula and Pommie. Sparra and Paula are a young couple that are making plans for the future, when an old friend of Sparra's turns up. I don't want to say too much about the plot as it may give the twist away. But I would describe this film as a love story. Sullivan Stapleton creates a very tense atmosphere whenever he appears on screen, so much so, that he puts you on edge watching him. Alex Russell and Jessica De Gouw play the young couple whose lives are turned upside down by Pommie's appearance. All of the actors do a great job. I think it is a big shame that this film has not had a cinema release, so I am EXTREMELY happy that I have been able to purchase the DVD. I was not disappointed at all with this film. For me personally, I think that Sullivan Stapleton was terrific in this role. It is so different to anything that I have seen him in before, and I have managed to see quite a lot of his work. Well worth a look.",1449964800,13,1274,4.059523809523809

8728039,5,B013JB2M9I,I wasn't sure what to expect but I thoroughly enjoy watching Sullivan Stapleton. This movie was different than the others I'd seen him in. As much as I love his other work this blew me away. I also have to say that Alex Russell was amazing too.,1525046400,,244,4.212765957446808

8728043,1,B013JB2M9I,"what a film from 'oz'. made in 2014 and set in the 1970s this film has so much to answer for. every scene is 'crammed' with 70s kitsch that would 'never' be in 'anybody's' home with such 'abundance'.
the 'film' centres around 'pommie' who's just been released form 'prison', he goes to 'visit' an old 'cell-mate' and resume their 'plan' (whatever that was). he finds his ex-cellmate 'sparra' living happily with his fianc&eacute; in some picturesque home in the highlands of Victoria. he doesn't like that and 'proceeds' to destroy this 'idyll'.
the first scene of pommie being released looks like the scene from 'The Boys' when he's released. a further scene at a 'club' with a drag queen looks like an outtake from 'Priscilla Queen of the Desert' and most any famous Australian movie gets plagiarised.
the detournment we're all 'waiting' for arrives when pommie start kissing sparra and we realise what his problem has been all along.i can only hazard a guess that all of pommie's erstwhile 'machismo' through thus far is what the culture pegs as 'straight-acting'....
all the cars they drive around in are 'classic' holden cars that any petrolhead would drool over - ALL in IMMACULATE condition.
