7817027,4,630192844X,"THE RETURN OF BRUNO is a one-hour production of Bruce Willis's film company that promoted his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/MOTOWN-music-CD/dp/B00000DWTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">MOTOWN music CD</a>&nbsp;of the same name. (As of 5/10, ""Return"" was not available on DVD.)

The show is divided between documentary and concert film. Willis has surprising vocal abilities and all the moves of a rock star, as he so ably demonstrates during a 20 minute concert. But first we're treated to an exploration of the career of Bruce's alter-ego, Bruno Radolini. Host Dck Clark shows an old b&w American Bandstand clip of Bruno's Prince Valiant-coiffed '60s rock band, and we learn from the stars themselves how influential this legendary vocalist was in their music careers.

Ringo Starr recalls how Bruno got the unemployed drummer a gig with a relatively unknown band, the Beatles. We see Bruno's grunge period at a New Jersey club quite reminiscent of Liverpool's Cavern. Steven Stills tells how worried the newly-formed Crosby, Stills & Nash were that they might have to follow Bruno at Woodstock. Graham Nash says it was Bruno who suggested the event be a free concert. Grace Slick's disappointment that Jefferson Airplane was cut out of the movie of that historic show ended when she learned Bruno's act wouldn't be seen either.

Joan Baez suggests that a surreal Bruno music video was the starting point of the psychedelic era and she cringes at the lyrics of this Magical Mystery type performance film. A 1971 Temptations/Bruno collaboration on ""Under the Boardwalk"" is shown. The Bee Gees credit Bruno's lyric suggestions to their disco success in SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER (1975). And in a nod to Robert Palmer's ""Addicted To Love"" video, the song that sent Bruno into self-imposed exile is aired. In it, he has four bass-playing black-leathered babes backing his solo harmonica.

But now, as the ageless Clark observes, the great Bruno has reemerged from the mists and he's better than ever! Michael J. Fox, the world's biggest Bruno fan/memorabilia collector, pops a "" professional tape into a player and we're treated to several NEW live performances by the one and only BRUNO RADOLINI!  (yay!)

Also seen and heard from in the mockumentary portion: Brian Wilson, Elton John, Wolfman Jack, Phil Collins, Jon Bon Jovi, Paul Stanley and Bill Graham.",1272326400,5,2391,5.362666666666667

i would buy it again if it comes out on DVD",1201392000,3,399,3.925925925925926
7817029,5,630192844X,"This VHS used to be very hot in the 80s, especially after the Moonlighting series success. Apparently it hasn't yet been released on DVD and the vhs format is supposed to be the only available one, right now. The mockumentary is hugely funny and enjoyable and the final concert footage is the real highlight of it all. Pity they didn't put more of Willis' live performance in it! If you're a big Bruno fan (and you still own a vcr) buy this item. It's a real must!",1148342400,5,464,4.344827586206897
