4685435,5,B005FSEQBG,"I wish that everyone would see this film. I am from New Orleans, and the devastation from Hurricane Katrina is beyond what most people can imagine. This film accurately tells the story of the continued ineptitude of the Army Corps of Engineers in regards to the city of New Orleans. It also shows how certain whistleblowers have been penalized for their honesty and integrity concerning the situation.

A lot of people don't understand why we New Orleanians blame the government for Katrina, since it was a ""natural"" disaster. You will get it after seeing The Big Uneasy.",1313971200,16,571,4.88659793814433
4685436,3,B005FSEQBG,"Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- Over the course of the past few years, it's been made clear that the devastation brought to New Orleans was not entirely a result of the natural disaster that was Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made a series of critical failures that turned what could have been merely a bad situation into a massive tragedy. In the wake of the Hurricane, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers devoted its resources to protecting itself and attacking those who called its integrity into question. It's a bitter, unpleasant story that needs to be told, but is Harry Shearer really the right guy to tell it?

My initial instinct would have been ""yes."" Shearer is an intelligent, thoughtful person (as evidenced by his newspaper editorials, his Huffington Post blog entries, and his numerous appearances on television talk shows addressing the subjects he explores in this film) and certainly has some personal knowledge of the area (he has been a part-time New Orleans resident for more than twenty years). Additionally, his sharp comic sensibilities suggested that he might be able to bring some flavorful bite to his take on this part of history.

Disappointingly, Shearer's actual movie proves much less involving than many of the public appearances he's made to promote the film. I expected the documentary to be smart and well-informed, which it most assuredly is. However, I didn't expect the execution to be so dry, amateurish, and uninvolving. Shearer assembles a sizable crew of individuals to give us the specific details on what happened piece-by-piece, but the manner in which the film is structured makes it feel more like a 90-page legal report than a gripping real-life drama.

To be sure, The Big Uneasy is a well-intentioned film, and it's valuable if you're just looking for the basic facts on what happened. Still, it lacks both the emotional pull of Spike Lee's When the Levees Broke and the polish of an in-depth New York Times article. It will prove a solid resource for high school students in years to come, but the average viewer has numerous superior options that cover similar territory to choose from.

4685459,4,B005FSEQBG,"The primary focus of the documentary The Big Uneasy is the Hurricane Katrina that happen in New Orleans in 2006. The narrator takes us through the dynamics of the natural disaster going back to predictions made in history, then to the investigations of what really happened and the possible explanations behind it. The issue of concern was why this Katrina happened and a lot of the reason for that came from the fact that the levees or protection of the London Avenue and other parts of the areas affected by the flooding were not properly built. More importantly, a great deal of this documentary digs into the engineering team, the army engineering corp, responsible for this and how their lack of attention to crucial protocols  caused people to lose their lives and much property to be destroyed. Three main arguments that arise from the discussions in this documentary is one, the circumstances that led up to the Katrina, two, the corp and its justification when blamed for its negligence, and three, the rather unfortunate consequences faced by the engineers who stood up for the truth. These are all very interesting arguments that help better the understanding of how this natural disaster happened and ways it could have been prevented.
 Apparently, the occurrence of this natural disaster was no shock to some expert engineers one of which is Ivor Van Heerdan, a professor and researcher who predicted in the early 90s that a hurricane would hit the city warning that construction should be made more solid. He reported this to higher authorities and the citys construction agents saying that the chances of a hurricane taking out half of the city are very high but he was turned away. Then the hurricane happened, he got to work. What was a theoretic speculation became reality. Heerdan and a number of his independent engineer and scientist colleagues formed team Louisiana and investigated the site. They found a number of red flags and from the research and site visits stated that the construction of the walls were faulty, hence allowing for the floods to come in at a rather high frequency. The argument was that the materials used were not appropriate for that flood wall and the cause was from the carelessness of the constructors responsible. The circumstance that led to the Katrina obviously was first the sea rising and flowing into the city, however, the scientist say that the bigger cause was man made as a result of lack of the prevention. When watching the documentary and seeing footage of this so called levees and flood walls at the London Avenue I could not arrive at the possibility of common concrete walls holding back the force of sea water rushing for a city. Robert Bea another prominent figure in this investigation mentions something about the walls designed to be constructed at 14 feet but were constructed at 10 feet, like 4 feet would make the big difference. In my head still it does not add up for man made barriers to stop a raging sea. The part that makes a little bit of sense to me a least is the part where the investigators reach a point on the discovery that the sand between the flood wall in London Avenue allowed for the easy penetration of water. They dug up the past by digging up the soil only to find out it was composed of sand rather than clay. The documentary points out another part of the argument which says that the constructors, army corp I assume, reported to the court the situation about the bad sand soil but the court rejected their case and so they went ahead with the design. This caused the easy access of the water and the continuous sip into the city. This part of the argument is crucial because without a foundation for an investigation or an entity to hold accountable for this disaster it would be difficult to make proper adjustments and take better precautions for the future.
 This leads up to the army corp who are held solely responsible for this catastrophe. Throughout the documentary not one good thing is said about the corp and it is not hard to see why. One expert said they are known for making dumb decisions, another said they are ""transparent"" when it comes to doing things wrong. For instance, while the private engineer investigators tried to access the London Avenue site there were constant with straits by the corp and its associates authorizing the entrance of no other people but the corp engineers. This was very suspicious and they even constructed a fence blocking the area. It was declared a crime scene because of the red flags raised by the corp themselves and the team Louisiana were permitted to go in. The corp was blamed for the gravity of the damage caused because of the errors they made right at the beginning of the construction. During that time they dug deeper walls that kept slumping and as they slump they simply dug it deeper as opposed to finding a better and more permanent solution to the problem. I am surprised that huge construction corporation, largely and well funded as well would commit such careless mistakes. Insufficient funds are usually easy to put the blame on for such errors but the congress pumped millions to dollars to them each time to was needed to dig deeper the slumping wall with no questions asked. Construction was not the only fault, they lacked manpower and actual engineers who understand the work that was to be done and how to do it. Where the argument sort of pauses is the part in the documentary where they admit to lacking in capable engineers which was causing the corp to suffer. The incompetence of the army corp continues to show with a lot of evidence from the defending of the poorly managed risk assessment to the replacement of better pipes for testing during the investigation of the Katrina. Maria Garzino lamented about the poor performance of the testing pipes but the corp did nothing to change it another display of carelessness. When blamed for faulty construction hey would commend on their work pointing out its uniqueness which has nothing to do with safety. These are a few ways the director presents evidence of the incompetence of the army corp. It is important they are called out and exposed so that there is no coverage in the main cause of the Katrina and who should be responsible for the lives lost.
 This calling out of the army corp was a bold move made by these investigators engineers and it had consequences. This third argument seeks to find out why they would get fired or sanctioned for standing up for the truth. We can understand that no one wants their name dragged in the mud but for something of this gravity and with implications like this the army corp probably did not have the boldness to own up. With backup from the congress, the government, and the court, Heerdan, Bea, and Garzino were facing unemployment threats and other terrible circumstances. Bea reported that he was accused of ""being an enemy to the United States,"" and he admitted that it was a hurtful statement but he will stand by the truth over everything else. He lost a bunch of his fellow engineer friends. Heerdan faced a tougher consequence of losing his job with no reason why. He felt troubled because he was not told what he did wrong to get fired. This signals one thing and that is the presence of corruption in American politics. This is one importance of this argument that is to show the way or methods in which the government exercises corruption and cuts off those who are unwilling to cover up. The government will do anything to protect their associates and what does not make clear sense to me was these engineers had already widely exposed the cause of the Katrina to the public so getting rid of them was almost not helpful. Evidence is shown in the documentary of Garzino sending out letters to congress offices and to even the white house presenting the situation of faulty pipe and its effect on lack of productive results for the investigation but no actions were taken. Rather she was apprehended and asked to step down. The idea of corruption is my own theory but a missing part of this argument would be the real reason why these three people faced consequences of such weight.
 From the viewpoint of an urban planner this documentary adds to my knowledge of city structuring, construction, and attention to potential future mishaps. When planning it is essential to not only focus on the beauty or appearance of the details but to ensure there is a solid enough foundation to carry the structure.",1394928000,,8497,4.726904922454485

4685465,5,B005FSEQBG,"Don't look for any comedy from Harry Shearer or even John Goodman who does a few brief bits in sections of this film.  This is a serious, well-researched documentary about the REAL reasons why new Orleans flooded so easily and quickly when Hurricane Katrina hit them in the summer of 2005, cuz the problem that caused the flood STILL EXISTS!

Spoiler Alert:  I'm gonna tell you the main reason right now, cuz even people who don't see this worthy DVD need to know this.  Half of New Orleans is ABOVE sea level, so that wasn't the reason.  It's cuz the Army Corps of Engineers (*) did a shoddy job of building the flood control walls, putting them on lose sandy soil that the flood waters EASILY could erode UNDER the walls, which then allowed the walls to simply fall over and let all the water in.  (* The Army Corps usually do good work; the awesome Bonneville Dam on the Columbia River in my part of America was VERY well built by them.)  But the job was rushed in New Orleans and then swept under then table when several independent engineers tried to warn them that a flood would still happen, even when everybody was told by the Corps that the walls would hold back the water just fine.

The film is professionally produced with lots of animation and understandable illustrations of what is being talked about and Shearer paid attention to pacing to keep interest in the film crisp and to the point.  It goes into great detail (as good as any PBS documentary) about the area's history, and why the flood happened, how it could have been prevented, how public perception of the whole event was manipulated to NOT know the REAL truth of the disaster, and how it STILL needs to be corrected, cuz it's only a matter of time until another big hurricane hits New Orleans and the whole flood thing happens all over again, and again, until the walls are re-built on more solid ground and foundations.

The only downside of the film is that Shearer badly needs a shave for most of the film, but I suppose that could be fixed by ILM for the Blu-Ray edition.

The film is highly recommend for anyone who lives anywhere near there, and by anyone who gives a damn about one of America's cultural high-spot treasures who should never have to go thru this nightmare again.

4685466,5,B005FSEQBG,"As a person that lived the Katrina experience it was nice to see someone go after the real story.  I feel for those who sacrificed their careers for the truth.  Sorry to say that New Orleans still could be devastated by a direct hit from a Class 3+ storm.  The only thing I would have liked to seen is more of the story on St Bernard parish, New Orleans always gets the press but people in St Bernard dealt with a 30 ft title wave with standing water of 15 feet.  With the new Great Wall of New Orleans St Bernard will be sacrificed again.",1344384000,2,539,4.104761904761904
4685477,5,B005FSEQBG,"Spike Lee's documentary WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE covers George W. Bush's indifferent response to the 2005 Hurricane Katrina disaster.  This film, Harry Shearer's THE BIG UNEASY, is the GODFATHER, PART TWO to the GODFATHER that is WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE, showing what came before and what's happened since.

For all the faults of the Bush gang, they weren't the only ones to put politics and other special interests above the safety of the people of New Orleans, THE BIG UNEASY tells us. People know Harry Shearer best for both his roles in Christopher Guest's comedies and as the voice of many characters on television's THE SIMPSONS.  But he keeps a straight face in THE BIG UNEASY and that may be to hold back tears, not smiles.

Is it my imagination, or in recent years have documentaries such as THE BIG UNEASY taken the lead in providing the public with the kind of facts news organizations used to report?  Not that Harry Shearer had to do much digging.  THE BIG UNEASY notes it is merely conveying information that is public, not from a government file marked ""Top Secret.""  Perhaps another film, what would be the GODFATHER, PART THREE to Spike's and Harry's documentaries, will backtrack to the corporate news media that receded from the Katrina story with the flood waters.

New Orleans was never one of my favorite places, but;  it definitely had character and the flavor of the Gulf.  What happened there, and has been happening to the people there since Katrina hit, is a travesty that the world has witnessed.  This film brings to light only a few of the salient facts about the whole mess.  Just get off your political soap box for a minute, and compare what has been done with and to the New Orleans Area with regard to Katrina - look to see where any real help has come from (private agencies, local volunteers, local businesses, and the like) - then compare what Japan has done since the devastating tsunami of March 11th.

4685479,5,B005FSEQBG,"This was a surprisingly good documentary. There were no laugh tracks or even whitty quips by way of writer/producer and professional comedian/satirist Harry Shearer. This film portrayed the death and devastation that hit NO, but more importantly it explained why the real villian was not mother nature, but ineptitude. The ineptitude came by way of the Army Corp of Engineers which built the levees that surround the city to only withstand a level 3 hurricane. Anything higher had the potential to devastate the city and inevitably did when parts of the city flooded. Adding insult to injury, FEMA was slow in coming to the aid of the residents and this only added to the chaos and devastation that the residents of the city (most prominently the poor, sick, or elderly)had to endure.
This film explains why the residents of NO blame the government and its agencies for not acting faster or offering them adequate protection against a catastrophe of monumental proportion. It was extremely well-done and was not only interesting but involving.",1335139200,,1043,5.069767441860465

4685483,5,B005FSEQBG,"So, was Katrina a ""natural disaster"" as the media & government would have you believe? Or was it a man-made one?
Actor, writer & comedian Harry Shearer didn't have to break into some secret file to uncover the truth. The evidence was there for anyone to see: collapsed floodwalls, failed pumping systems, and a failure on the part of the media that can't be topped. The post-Katrina disaster, well, we know about that: lack of aid, FEMA screw-ups, homelessness, the abandonment of entire sections of New Orleans. But it's what happened BEFORE to cause the flooding that matters most: poorly designed, under-funded projects touted as New Orleans' protection from storms even more powerful than Katrina. Most of the flooding in N.O. was not caused by the storm going OVER the walls, but rather of the storm going UNDER them and breaking them at the ill-designed foundation; pumps designed to evacuate water from the city which never met testing standards;  whistle blowers ignored and demoted; post-Katrina reports ignored by the media.
And not only is this an investigative film which takes us where the journalists should have, but it's an insightful, human tale as well. John Goodman (doing his very best ""John Goodman""!) introduces us to New Orleanians who tell their stories, too.

Its about Engineers who trie to find out why the city flooded; did find out why and when they tried to tell people, these same Engineers were treated as whistle blowers and some were relieved of their positions.

Having been a So. Calif. tourist stuck in the Superdome during Katrina and the levee failures I was most interested in seeing this documentary.  I was fortunate to attend the screening in New Orleans and Harry was present for a Q & A.  While not totally objective, as I was there during the debacle of this unnatural disaster and natural disaster, I still would have found this film as captivating and especially enlightening even if I had been safe at home.

While one may expect some humor with Harry making this movie, you won't find that in this film.  What you will find is an eye opening discovery of the links between Congress, the Army Corps of Engineers, Subcontractors, and special interests whose interest are not your safety but rather building water projects that reward contributors, speed, cutting corners, and friends.  You will discover the lack of accountability in these projects and the pain which those who are whistle-blowers have to endure to try and protect the 51% of us who live in counties ""protected"" by Army Corps' projects.

There are many myths surrounding Hurricane Katrina and the death and destruction in New Orleans.  Unfortunately too many Americans still attribute that to Katrina the storm, when in fact it was the failed Army Corps of Engineers levees that couldn't survive a Category 3 storm, and the slow response by FEMA that led to most of the deaths and destruction in NOLA.  After seeing this film you will be a believer.

Furthermore you will gain a better understanding of how money runs our political systems (in case you weren't already atune to this).  This film is a winner because it does what a documentary is supposed to do; providing raw first person footage and first person commentary in a way that elucidates and educates the viewer in a clear manner.",1314403200,30,2064,5.359133126934984
