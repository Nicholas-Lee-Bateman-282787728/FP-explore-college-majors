7899275,3,6305995990,"I laughed quite a bit when that line came out in the middle of working out to this title.
I agree with the criticisms of some of the other reviewers - this is not a great instructional video - floor and step patterns change for no apparent reason and confusing things happen, like Denise will instruct ""Okay, we are going to go over the step now"" and then four movements later it actually happens. I am used to instructors doing stuff when they say NOW, not 16 beats later. I don't know what was wrong with Denise that day - maybe the glaring colour of her leotard damaged her thinking as much as my eyes!
But anyway, that said, it's not a terrible tape. The actual stepping part is quite easy whilst still working up a sweat, and as long as you have a good memory and do the tape a couple of times, you soon know when NOT to follow her instructions. I like to use the tape as a lighter sort of workout that is still quite active - like I might do it in the morning instead of a walk some days.
The ab section is okay but the body sculpt/weight section is a bit too light and the warm down is a bit light too. But on the whole, its a tape I don't mind doing every ten days or so.",1060732800,2,1179,4.0212765957446805
7899276,3,6305995990,"My mother bought me this video from a garage sale. I'm only 16 and always full of energy and I had to FORCE myself to try this video. It's very dancey and you don't feel it in certain areas as you do with Denise's other videos. You just feel tired and unsatisfied in the end. I wouldn't recommend it.
I do give it 3 stars though because despite how bad it is, Denise stil maintains her perky-ness. She's great if you're working out alone.",1056844800,,438,4.226190476190476
7899277,2,6305995990,"If you can ever get by Denise Austin's phony pitches, you might get through this discombobulated step workout!  I would sure love to give her an ACTING class, and I don't even act.  No matter how many times a week you do this, you will remain confused!  It's step on the floor, strut, sway, back, step, etc. etc.
Ssteps are not easy to follow; no consistency, quick moving changes, etc.  I prefer a consistent workout with few changes.  I don't need to prance around like a goony just to jazz it up.  Give me consistency!  She also offers a toning up and stretch utilizing the step as a bench.  If you really want good step workout, try Kathy Smith Step workouts......MzRizz",1017446400,3,674,4.512396694214876
7899278,5,6305995990,I have been out of shape since the birth of my 5th child 5 years ago.  I FINALLY pulled out this tape and after 18 days of using this tape 6 days a week.  I have lost 2 jeans sizes already!  I haven't been this thin or firm in YEARS.  It was hard to get started but it is getting much easier and I get a GREAT all over workout.  I've gone from not making through it all to making it through the entire workout at FULL capacity. I look forward to loosing ALL my extra weight and even wearing a swimsuit this summer.,1017014400,,514,3.9038461538461537
