4076168,5,B0036EH3WU,"i know this is a pre-review, but, barring some glaring technical glitch, this will be a truly great set.  LOST is a show unlike any other in the history of the medium.  not only is it a great show, with inspired acting, inspiring music, gorgeous photography, and trippy storylines...  not only does it have deep characterizations and an even deeper mythology...  not only is it cinematic in scope yet intimate in the smallest character moments...  not only is it, like, totally addicting.  it's also the first time (at least here in the u.s.) that a t.v. series has a complete beginning, middle and end, just as the creators intended it.

so many shows start out brilliantly, chug along for a while on that inspiration, then start to peter out somewhere along the way and then... stop (twin peaks).  or, are episodic in nature and don't have the burden of having to *end* properly.  but LOST started off with a bang, settled in with the characters and their predicament, started to repeat itself *just* a bit, then decided that it needed to end at a certain point and started it's long steady march toward it's denouement.  and it's been nothing but greatness ever since.

it's often said that movies are like short stories, and t.v. is more like a novel.

well, we have our first truly great novel.",1272844800,28,1299,4.674008810572687
4076169,5,B0036EH3WU,"I'm planning . . . I take that back, I WILL be ordering this. This has been one of the best shows on TV for the past 6 years. Thanks ABC.
  My only question is what special features will be loaded with this set.",1271203200,4,211,3.772727272727273
4076170,5,B0036EH3WU,"It's a dangerous thing to expose the ending of an incredibly important television show before the rest of the world gets to see it; how would you like it if someone told you who won American Idol before the first round even airs?  But now that I've seen the epic conclusion to LOST, well, I have no choice but to reveal the ending.  Why?  Because your lives depend on it.

So I'm sure you've seen what's been aired so far.  Not-Locke (""Smocke"") is plotting his escape from the island and our beloved characters are choosing sides.  A bizarre alternate reality shows Ben as a teacher and Hurley with a tremendous dose of good luck.  Viewers are speculating whether these ""flash-sideways"" will somehow converge with the island reality, causing the characters to make even bigger decisions about how their lives should progress.  But what you the viewer should be considering instead is, what does YOUR existence mean?

For this is not fantasy my friends.  Oh, no; soon YOU will be making the decision of what dimension you want to exist in.  Damon and Carlton have said all along that they've known what the final scene of LOST would look like since they started the show.  Now I know why.  They've become privy to information that, if revealed to the public at large instead of just these two talented writers, would have torn the world apart with fear and anxiety.  LOST was created to prepare us for the real 'incident' that will occur just after the final episode airs in May.

On May 23rd, at 11:42p.m. (23:42 military time), a massive electromagnetic burst will hit planet Earth.  When it does, time will split into at least three separate timelines.  Depending on what you're doing at that exact moment, you will be thrust into one of these dimensions.  In one, every material object you ever wanted can be yours but you will no longer be able to love.  In another, you will be with your true love but your moral compass will be askew and you'll find yourself riddled with guilt.  And in the third, all free will must be given up but you will be guaranteed a life filled with peace.  It will be your choice.

If I were you, I'd pre-order the DVD box set before the incident. That way, you'll probably be able to take it with you regardless of the dimension you end up in.  We all need a constant.",1270684800,14,2301,4.545012165450122
4076171,5,B0036EH3WU,I can't wait for this to be released!!! I can't wait to watch it over and over again looking for clues and easter eggs!!,1269388800,4,120,4.041666666666667
4076172,5,B0036EH3WU,"Contrary to some confused reviewers, all six seasons will be included in this collection.  Since the newest season is not yet complete, they can not list a synopsis in the product description.  That being said, Lost is the most original and creative television series of all time, and I'm sure this collection will be bursting with easter eggs and plenty of behind the scenes info for die hard fans.
Also, the extra features are A-MAZING!  There are so many easter eggs and fun mysteries to discover in the package itself!  Really a fabulous Lost set, perfect for any fan of the show.  I enjoyed this collection so much, don't miss out on a great piece of television history.",1268784000,187,675,4.686440677966102
4076173,5,B0036EH3WU,"Because it is imposible to review a product that has yet to be released, my five star rating is based on the five and one-half seasons I have seen. I am hoping that the ending will be worth the wait. I also hope that I can allocate enough time to watch the entire collection in a short period of time. With its late August release, my goal is to view as much of the series as I can before the NFL season gets underway. After that, I lose Sundays and Monday nights as time when I can watch. As for fears that season six won't be part of the package, I am assuming that all six seasons will be included. After all, it is called ""complete."" I hope that purchasers of the blu-ray will have two viewing options: with or without the lower screen explanations that appear when an episode is re-run. If anyone knows whether that will happen, please post the answer in a comment to this reviw or in a separate review.

Watching an entire series in order can be a thrilling experience. I did that with the X-Files and look forward to doing the same with Lost. It should be even more satsifying with Lost because the creators and writers have known for a few years when the series would end and have had time to work out an ending that wraps things up (unlike Jerico that never got completed or the X-Files that seemed to limp to the finish line). As for anyone viewing the entire series over a Lost Weekend, I point out that John Lennon's so-called lost weekend lasted over a year!",1268352000,12,1471,4.2913669064748206
4076174,1,B0036EH3WU,"How is this a complete collection without season 6?  What's the point of getting this box set if you're just going to have to purchase the last season separately - which releases on blu-ray around the same time??

This is such a deal breaker for me.  I was going to pre-order, but thank God I read the description to see what seasons were included (the Amazon ""Customers who purchased this also purchased Lost: The Final Season"" thing threw me off and concerned me).

I realize companies want to double-dip, and I can accept that, but dont' advertise a ""Complete Collection"" without it actually being complete.  That is blatant false advertisement and I'm honestly considering reporting this product to the BBB.",1268352000,26,711,4.891666666666667
4076175,5,B0036EH3WU,"God bless Amazon for fast-tracking shipments of LOST's final season before it's even finished airing on TV!  We watched all the episodes over 2 days and let me tell you....the twists and turns that pepper this final season will BLOW YOU AWAY!

HERE BE SPOILERS!  Who would have thought alternate-reality Jack's explicit gay encounter with alternate-reality Hurley (06x12 - Everybody Loves Hugo) could even be screened on network TV?  Unless the DVD version is unrated?

The final ending twist, being that the whole story from the beginning was just a dream of Vincent's (Walt's dog), a-la Pam from Dallas, was genius. In reality, the survivors are only on the beach for another 2 hours before a passing cargo ship spots them and they are rescued!

But the whole 'backwards talking' episode (06x09 - Ab Aeterno) just fell flat in my opinion.  HELLO?  Twin Peaks anyone?  And they had the good sense to do it for only one scene.....not the whole episode!

Other small touches, like the death of Jack halfway through the season, the musical episode, the Smoke Monster/Locke reveal, and the copious amounts of explicit sex, especially involving Hurley and Claire, really made the final season the most memorable.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1265846400,22,1229,5.034653465346534

The surprises, mysteries, suspense, clues, and personalities are extremely thought provoking.  Very interesting the way the character's pasts are intermixed with the present adding substantial depth, then with a twist in later seasons where there is a flashback o the future for each character.

I was really excited to find this complete series, since it's very difficult to find season 6 from anyone other than private sellers, which I rarely trust or use. I have a Sony multi-region dvd/blu-ray player. When I put in the disc, it asked me to pick from a lare selection of languages. I chose English, then every thing from that point on looked exactly like the other individual seasons that I had purchased and watched. The menus were in English, including the episode titles. And when I turned on the episode, I was able to choose English subtitles, and they really were in English. I'm not sure if others received counterfeit products or what, but mine is just fine.

4076254,1,B0036EH3WU,"(This is for the ""July 09, 2013"" version, whatever that means)
Like a handful of other reviewers, mine play (on both a PlayStation 3 and standalone Samsung Blu-Ray player) with menu text that I assumed to be Japanese but may instead be Korean. That is, in order for the episodes to play, I had to blindly navigate the non-intuitive menu system, all in...Korean? in order to play the episodes, and once they played they still had subtitles in an Asian text.

Unfortunately, I had waited several months before trying to watch these. When they arrive, nothing at all on the packaging indicated that they would be anything but English; all of the text on the box is in English, and English is the first language listed on both audio and subtitles, so I saw no reason to question it on its arrival. I'd call it an inaccurate listing, but who knows, maybe there was something like the marginal ""not your region"" warning then like there is now. Not that I would have even noticed it then if I wasn't looking for something. Blech.

Still, I'll request a return and see what happens. I'll edit if I get anywhere, but in the meantime, I strongly recommend not buying this 6-season box set unless you're okay with reading whichever language its menus are in, which I to this day don't see listed anywhere on the Amazon listing.

.
Im not sure why I decided to watch Lost in the first place, but from the very first episode I was hooked. Lost began way back in 2004, a time in my life when I was without an HDTV, or a provider that even provided HD programming. This show was made for high definition sights and sounds, between the constant breathtaking backdrop of Hawaiis landscape and the ghostly whispers of the mysterious islands jungles, we need to take in every nuance Lost has to offer. I think I upgraded to my first HDTV somewhere during the second season of Lost, and even though I enjoyed the amazing picture ABC had to offer, it wasn't the quality level that I enjoy watching Lost these days. With the Blu-Rays I feel like Im finally getting the full story, the whole picture.

Lost was a television series that lasted six seasons, some much shorter than others. The story is about a commercial flight from Sydney Australia to Los Angeles California that never arrives. Somewhere over the South Pacific, the airplane hits some turbulence and actually tears in half before it crashes onto a beach on some remote uncharted island. Before you even begin to imagine some goofy rip off of Gilligans Island, let me put your mind at rest  its nothing like it. Sure both shows can be really funny, but when it comes to this island, the mystery and the history are unmatched.

Season One begins with the crash and the immediate aftermath. We see that there are actual survivors from every walk of life. The main characters out of the forty plus survivors are:

Jack Shepherd  a spinal surgeon. Through the various flashbacks we find out that Jack was on the plane because he went to Sydney to pick up his fathers body and bring it back to Los Angeles. The two had a falling out over professional reasons. He serves as the primary care physician for the survivors on the island.

Kate Austin  a fugitive. Yet she was on the plane finally being brought to justice after a series of heinous crimes committed by this super-hot babe. Perhaps shes just misunderstood? She is a good tracker, a wonderful golfer, and if you need a bad*ss at any point during your stay, shes a good choice to call on.

Sayid Jarrah  a former soldier in Iraqs Republican Guard. He admitted to some on the island that he has been a torturer during the war. Hes also good with electronics and communications.

Sawyer  a no good con man, yet with a soft spot for the unexpected thing. Hes your basic troublemaker, yet hes always good for a new nickname for one of the other survivors.

Sun Kwon  one half of the Korean couple that speaks no English. Shes good with identifying herbs found around the island, and she even starts her own garden.

Jin Kwon  The other half of the Korean couple. Jin is a tough guy to get along with, a product of working for even a tougher man, Suns father.

Hugo Hurley Reyes  an affable overweight dude who provides much of the comedy relief for the show. At home, he won the lottery and is worth roughly $15o million.

Charlie Pace  He is the drug addict bass player from one-hit wonder British rock band Drive Shaft.

Claire Littleton  She is a young Australian, very pregnant woman on her way to America to give up her baby for adoption.

John Locke  A wheelchair bound middle-aged man, returning to America in defeat after being denied the chance for an Australian Walkabout adventure. After the crash, he found that he could mysteriously walk again.

Shannon Rutherford  A stuck up, formerly rich and beautiful young woman who is too busy perfecting her tan to help with the chores to aid in the survivors survival. She is aware of her own beauty and uses it as a weapon to get whatever she needs to get by.

Boone Carlyle  he is Shannons step brother, yet he still has his money. He is always up for adventure on the island and sticks with John Locke most of the time, yet he still finds time to see that his sister is okay.

Michael Dawson  He is the lone African American survivor who is among the main characters. He had a son with a woman ten years ago, but they separated early in their sons life, and he hasn't seen his son for years. When his ex dies suddenly, he is sought out to reclaim parental rights to his long-lost son, Walt.

So as you can see, a pretty big cast, and I only mentioned the main characters, not the dozen or so others who had less air time. For the twenty-five episodes of this first season, we get to get to know our main characters through a series of flashbacks, usually an episode dedicated to each of the characters. We also get to witness the mystery of the island unfold as the days go by. At the end of the first episode, we see that there is something on this island that moves throughout the island, something powerful enough to topple large trees, yet somehow remain invisible. They find out that they are not the only people on this island; there are people that have been island residents for years. Why are they here? Who are they? Are they also stranded? Claire, the cute pregnant blonde is kidnapped at one point by an island resident for some reason. The survivors hypothesize that there must be more of these others than just the person that they encountered, and then they actually meet someone who looks to be their leader. They also discover that there may be a history of this island older than they thought when they stumble across a hatch in the jungle floor with no handles or visible way of opening it from the outside.

Season Two answers some of the questions we had in Season one, and also introduces some new characters to the show. We know some of the history of one of the islands longtime residents, Danielle Rousseau. She had been on the island for at least sixteen years, she arrived after hearing a transmission repeating a series of numbers, 4  8 - 15  16- 23  42 with a team of scientists. She claims that she had to kill her team after they became sick or infected. She led some of the survivors to a place on the island called The Black Rock. It was here where they would find some old dynamite that they would carry back to the hatch with an attempt to open it.

The characters we officially meet in Season Two are as follows:

Ana Lucia Cortez  She is a mentally unstable ex-cop from Los Angeles. She is the de facto leader of the Tailies, the group of survivors from the tail end of the plane that landed on another end of the island.

Mr. Eko  He is another one of the Tailies. He is originally from Nigeria with a dark past of drug lord, and a kind of Mafioso figure. He became a priest and practiced as so when he took over for his brother, Yemi after he was killed. Mr. Eko ended up traveling to London and then finally to Australia where he served as priest, Father Tunde.

Libby Smith  A cute blonde woman who, when united with the front end survivors, takes a romantic liking to Hurley. She is said to be a psychologist.

Henry Gale  A man who was caught in one of Rousseaus traps, was taken to the hatch and detained until it could have discerned who he is and what his story is. He is interrogated by Sayid and Ana Lucia, but he sticks to his story. The survivors had had deadly run-ins with some of the other people on the island, and they must be sure that Henry is not another one.

Desmond Hume  After being shipwrecked on the island during his race around the world, he is recruited by one of the Dharma Initiative members to help him with pushing the button every 108 minutes, a series of numbers 4 - 8 - 15 - 16 - 23 - 42 must be entered into a computer so that the world doesnt blow up.

Alex  a young hot brunette who is a part of The Others, yet she seems to want to help the crash survivors. A rebel amongst the Others.

In season two, we have Michael disappear for a few episodes as he heads off into the jungle looking for his son Walt who was taken by the Others. Claire has the baby, who was delivered by Kate in the jungle. Charlie, who was a former heroin junkie, stumbles upon the plane that was discovered by Locke and Boone in Season One, and was amazed that it was filled with heroin stuffed into dozens of Virgin Mary statuettes. Sawyer spent much of the season feeling under the weather as he was wounded, and as his wounds had gone too long untreated, Jack had his hands full trying to nurse Sawyer back to health. As we discover what is in the hatch, if Henry Gale was lying or not, and most of all what happens if you don't push the button that saves the world, we also are hit with new questions, new mysteries. Who are the others, and what are they doing on the island? What do these Others want with Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley? After a major incident, what has become of some of our beloved characters, including Charlie, Locke, Mr. Eko and Desmond?

Season Three immediately opens with some new characters as we go deeper into the Others and who they are. Keep in mind that as the show progresses, the cast does add characters in order to further the story, but unfortunately some stories have to end as we say goodbye to maybe some of our favorite characters. Death is indiscriminate in life and certainly in this show. Your favorite character is not guaranteed to last all six seasons, well maybe thats not entirely true. Yet even as we say goodbye to some of the cast we loved, with Lost we never had to say goodbye for long. Even the dead are able to reappear when we least expect them to, and entertain for at least a few minutes of an episode here and there.

Juliette Burke  another very cute and buxom blonde lives on the island among the Others. She is one tough cookie, although there is a side to her that is more compassionate especially compared to the other Others.

Ben Linus  This seems to be the leader of The Others. We knew this person from Season Two as somebody else. He is a bug-eyed manipulative and evil genius. Its too bad he uses his super powers for evil. Then again, is he evil? He is after all doing Jacobs will, isn't he?

Jacob - is highly regarded by The Others. He is only referred to, but not yet seen. He is the leader of The Others, and they and he have a long, long history with this island. How far back does it go?

Nikki and Paolo  This sexy Latino couple were on the island all along, as they apparently were also survivors of Oceanic Flight 815. In Season 3, they become visible amongst the rest of the extras. A history of their characters is portrayed in one episode. Nikki and Paolo are murderous thieves without any sign of a conscience. It seems as soon as they appeared, they disappeared thankfully.

Mikhail Bakunin  a former Russian soldier with nine lives apparently. He has been the Other that has been stationed to an outside facility to monitor the communication for the Others and civilization. He wears a patch over his right eye which along with his accent makes him a menacing looking dude. Some of the survivors first caught a glimpse of Mikhail in one of the hatch stations on a monitor.

Naomi Dorritt  This soldier somehow parachuted to the island after the helicopter she was in malfunctioned. She says that she is on a freighter some 80 miles off shore, and they're here to rescue the survivors. Yet something doesnt add up since she also told them that their plane was found at the bottom of the ocean and they are all believed to be dead.

In this third season, we learn a good deal more about the mysterious Others and their long history on the island. We learn what has happened to the Dharma Initiative and their scientists. We learn a bit more of the Hostiles, a name that Dharma called the islands natives. John Locke learns that his miracle healing is a sign to the Others that he must be special since the island had chosen to heal him. He embraces this role immediately, but is frustratingly still in the dark when it comes to the islands secrets.

Benjamin Linus likes it this way too. Ben, who is not one who is would be so willingly usurped even if it is the islands wishes. We also have to deal with the people on the freighter who are trying to get on the island. While Jack and the rest of the survivors are relieved that they are finally going to get rescued, Ben warns them that if they are able to get to the island they will all be killed, they aren't who they say they are. Locke seems to be on the same side with Ben about this, meanwhile Jack is determined to keep his promise to get these people off the island.

Season Four opens with the immediate aftermath as well as flash forwards to a time when six of the survivors are back in civilization. The six do not seem to be doing very well on their own. Jack especially is now addicted to a strong prescription drug, and abusing alcohol. He reads in the newspaper about an obituary on Jeremy Bentham. This is an alias for someone we know, but since the six have decided to hide the truth from the media and everyone else, this person was forced to assume a pen name, since he was able to make it off the island, but not with the six. Meanwhile back on the island, we are introduced to some new folks that made it to the island.

Daniel Faraday  A scientist who has made it onto the island. As time goes on, we understand that this character has a history with this island. He is necessary to the team on the freighter because they understand that it is hard to get to the island due to the time difference that seems to be surrounding the island as a kind of force field. Daniel is a physicist who has worked on the theories of time travel for most of his adult life.

Miles Straume  This Asian dude is not a doctor like Daniel, but his talent to communicate with the dead is possibly even more impressive than a PHD. His character is young and aggressive. He constantly gets aggravated with Daniel as hes so easy to give the survivors information that shouldnt concern them. After all, the people on the freighter have a mission that should be followed so that they could get back home as soon as they can.

Charlotte Lewis  A gorgeous buxom redhead is thrown into the mix. This beauty is an anthropologist, and Im not exactly sure why her credentials have earned her a spot on the freighter, but she was determined to get to this island any way, perhaps for years.

Frank Lapidus  an older white dude. He is the helicopter pilot hired for shuttles between the freighter and the island. It also turns out that the likable Lapidus was supposed to be the pilot for Oceanic flight 815, the very flight that crashed on the island on September 22nd, 2004.

Martin Keamy - one of the handful of merciless mercenaries hired to be on the freighter. Actually he is their leader. Anyone tangoing with this tough dude is sure to get behind Ben and Locke, because this guy means business. He and his gang killed a number of people off and on the island.

While I enjoy every season of Lost, for me Season Four is where it really takes off. One of my top three episodes from the entire series is from this season. The episode is called The Constant and it centers around Desmond Hume and Daniel Faraday, watch for it. Season Four also seems to move forward more than the first three, perhaps do to the fact that there are only a mere fourteen episodes here, especially when compared with the lengthy full seasons from the first three. There has always been a sense of supernatural elements at play within the first three season of Lost, but if you had any doubts or if you tried to reason this away with rational theories of reason, this season will put those to rest. We still get glimpses of the black smoke monster, but perhaps there is a little bit more we learn about this, not much though. When we tackle the idea of a long history with the island, this also tickles my fancy. It hits me right where I live, and it only gets better from here.

Season Five begins with the aftermath of the serious and dangerous lengths Ben Linus took at the instruction of Jacob to assure the islands protection as well as the safety of its inhabitants. The only man to fix it is John Locke. He must set the island back on its axis (so to speak) and go back to civilization and try and get the six former residents to come back to the island, as the island is still in danger. Locke is also under orders from Jacob. We learn that the island is never in the same place as it is constantly moving. This is why its so impossible to find on purpose. It so happens that there are Dharma stations on the main lands, one is hidden in Los Angeles. This station was created to monitor the islands constant whereabouts, and then a plan is hatched on how to get back. When John Locke came back and talked with them one on one, they blew him off pretty viciously. They seem to still hate Locke, despite the fact that he was right about everything they previously argued about on the island. Yet after 3 years go by, they soon are in the mindset that they have to go back. Those of the six who aren't are forced back to the island.

New people added to the cast include:

Dr. Pierre Chang  or as you have known him from the other seasons Marvin Candle, Edgar Halliwax and Mark Wickmund from those Dharma Initiative orientation films. So while he has appeared in all of the seasons from 2 and on, here we get a formal introduction to the dude.

Caesar  This guy ending up on the island with some of the others when they made their own way back. His character didn't last too long when Ben discovered that this guy was just a bossy Spanish busy body.

Ilana  She is kind of a mysterious character as she has some previous experience with Jacob. She is forever his servant or she just feels indebted to him. Either way, it was her job to get some of the stubborn survivors back to the island this season. She was the leader of a small band of armed dudes, and she answers directly to Jacob.

Jacob  We finally get to meet this mysterious Jacob. Hes the defacto ruler of the island. We also learn that Jacob has a mysterious companion from time to time we call The Man in Black.

Even up to this fifth season we are challenged with more questions than get answered. We meet Jacob, but who is he? How does he get on and off the island? How old is he? Who is this other dude that seems to hate him? Finally when we get to the last episode of the season, was Faraday correct is his theory? Was he the cause of the result of the infamous incident? As we get to this fifth season, if we take a minute to retrospectively look at the series and see where we have ended up, the show is a much different show than what weve started off as. Weve gone from Lord of the Flies to a sci-fi Star Trek like show. Yet, somehow it all makes sensewell not really, but hopefully and if you were paying attention, it will by the end of the series.

Season Six begins right where youd think it would, back on the plane and headed for LAX. Yet there is a bizarre and unpredictable twist about what has happened to our favorite characters. The experiment in Season Five  did it work or not? Well, you're not going to get that answer until the very last episode. This season was meant to be the answer key to most of the questions weve had up until this point. Why is this island special? We do get this answer. How did the island become special? Well never know. Why is there someone that needs to protect the island? We get this answer. Who was the first appointee to protect this island? Well never know. Are these people on the island for a reason? We find this out. Why do all of the characters still insist that John Locke is crazy when they just end up agreeing with everything hes ever said? That may be the biggest mystery here, and sadly well never know. Maybe they just needed someone to blame. There have been deaths over the years and within each season, and Season Six is no different. Its also consistent in that we meet some new characters.

Dogen  This Japanese dude looks and acts kind of like a samurai. He is the leader of the folks at the temple. Apparently when the children were taken is Season two from the Tailies, they were brought here to work as slaves. Some better life. We have been outside the temple and underneath it, this is the first time we get to go inside and see who lives there. Dogen is like the Ben Linus of the temple, in charge and ready to do Jacobs will.

Lennon  Yes, he is a long-haired hippie wearing granny glasses, but no one has yet to reference him as the slain Beatle. Lennon here has an American accent and his main purpose is to translate whatever Dogen says in Japanese into English. He reminds me of a kind of Metatron.

Season Six also welcomes back, even if just for an episode or two, some of the folks who had passed on during the series. I cant really tell you who or why, but it was awesome to see some of these people again. A lot of people have trashed the last episode, a real let down after such a great show. I for one thought it was one of the best episodes from the entire series. It answers questions, it wraps up everything, and there is enough substance and emotional content that after youve watched the series, the last episode is fun to watch over and over.

The blu-rays are beautifully housed in an illustrated gatefold, one for each season. These gatefolds are housed in a sleeve resembling an attractive faux stone like the blocks found in an Egyptian pyramid. This fits snugly into a larger half-pyramid shaped box with hieroglyphics that should look familiar to Lost fans. There are secret panels all around this sturdy blu-ray case. When you find the black light flash light, take it out and have fun spotting all of the clues left in just about every crevice of this blu-ray set.

One particular clue, if you look closely will lead you to look in a place you probably haven't yet, check it out. There may be even more Lost videos to check out including a final unaired episode. There is also a journal page from the mid-19th Century written on the Black Rock. You will also find an ancient version of backgammon.

Im assuming that the blu-rays themselves are just repackaged from the single seasons sold before this complete set was released. I was hoping for some different extras, maybe a more up to date remastering with something cool like 7.1 DTS Master Surround or something. Still and all Im not disappointed. The picture and the audio is still the best out there for this. Watching the episodes on Netflix or even television doesnt compare with the quality from a blu-ray.

The special features and extras are a-plenty, too bad most of them will bore you out of your skull. You know for the best! TV! Show! Ever!, youd expect some awesome extras. Some of them are cool, like the Jimmy Kimmel stuff, and the commentaries are interesting sometimes ( I appreciate that they warn you about spoilers for some of the commentaries). One feature I really like is something called Season Play. I started watching this series again with my family, and everytime I go over their house, no one can agree on where we left off. Season Play remembers where we are though. Just select to use it right there on the front menu and it will remember for you. Unfortunately, for the seasons two and three, they hid Season Play from the Top menu and hid it in the Play All menu. Each disc of each season has a cool menu scene from the show, but usually from a very different angle, just for that oh wow comment.

Now, while I have tried to be very thorough here, do not expect to find every character listed here, this list comes from watching the episodes, then compiling a list myself. Plus there are many other plots that have been ignored or glossed over in order to avoid many spoilers. I just wanted to give a big enough picture here so that we can get a good enough idea of the show. If you want more, go to Lostpedia, or even Wikipedia. I still love the show, I still regard it as the best TV show ever, it still makes me laugh, it still makes me cry and it still sends shivers down my spine.

4076337,4,B0036EH3WU,"MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD! When ""Lost"" ended back in the day, I was extremely frustrated. I posted a review of the series on one of the many online forums for the show and having rediscovered it on my PC today, I thought I'd share it here as well. Although I've come to terms with the way the series ended, at the time, I was very torn. Today I can simply say, although the ride was far more satisfying than the destination, it remains some of the best television to grace the small screen. So without further ado, here's my initial review having had just watched the series finale back in May 2010:

We're all, in one way or another, trying to figure out what this whole ""Lost"" experience meant to us. We all feel differently. Some feel relieved, satisfied, frustrated, betrayed, confused, etc. I feel of all these things.

In actuality, it's debatable if the creators/writers knew what they were doing. I believe they did to some extent. They most likely had a general concept. Its possible they had the entire concept but didn't work out the details as to how to properly execute it. Or, as others have stated, they may have had to change the concept after Season 1 or 2 (due to the fact that many fans were suspicious that the cast mates were dead). Either way, I feel that they had an obligation to solve the mysteries that were created. I, unlike some, liked the ending and the flash-sideways, or at least the idea of it. I would have liked it A LOT more had they also answered the questions set up throughout the entire series. You cannot dispute that they provided far more questions than answers. One great example is Walt. I was really annoyed by the fact that they dropped Walt's storyline because actor, Malcolm David Kelley, aged. The show introduced time travel! They could have easily written him back in and told us that time travel was part of his ""special"" power. They could have explained the childbirth issue. Worst of all, why did they introduce The Tailies storylines and flashbacks in Season 2 just to kill all but one character (Bernard)? I know the creators/writers had to deal with real life circumstances like Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Mr. Eko) being unhappy living in Hawaii or Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros getting bad press over the DUI incident, however, they should have explained the departure of these characters in some way or another. Come up with something! You're WRITERS, for pete's sake!

Can anyone honestly tell me that when The Others kidnapped Walt at the end of Season 2, you weren't 99.9% sure that you would find out why by the next season, or at the very least, by the end of the series (FYI - ""because he is special is not a good enough answer for me)? I mean, weren't you fairly certain that you would get definitive answers as to what exactly Walt's powers were and why children couldn't be conceived on the island? There are still a plethora of unanswered questions yet the series is over. You can theorize all day but those aren't answers to me. Fans can argue and blame one another for being too stupid to understand the ""brilliance and intelligence"" of the ending or too smart to understand the ""true meaning"" or ""purpose"" of the ending. You're all forgetting though, this shouldn't be our job as viewers. Of course, some things should be left to viewer interpretation but not everything. If you look at the entire series, I think 60% of it is left to conjecture. I think there's something majorly wrong with that. I mean look at how upset everyone is on these boards! We're either fighting to defend it or fighting to send it into the fiery depths for racking our brains for six years. It's crazy! All the while, Lindelof and Cuse are laughing all the way to the bank.

Some may ask, Why do you need the answers? Cant you be satisfied with the overall theme and mythology? Absolutely not and Ill tell you why. If a show runner is going to categorize his show as a ""mystery"", then he needs to provide the answers to those mysteries. That's why the audience is watching. Some people may be satisfied with the ending and not need all the answers. Well, I can say that Im honestly happy for you. I wish I could feel that way but I cant. I'd be somewhat mollified if the show didn't give the audience the crystal clear impression that cliffhangers would eventually be answered. I mean, thats what a cliffhanger is! You find out the answer to WTF happened after our hero went off the cliff? ""Lost"" didn't provide a resolution for so many of these cliffhangers and its beyond disappointing...its sad.

Objectively, I can see the validity of both sides of the argument. Some people just watched to enjoy the ride and were fine with the feel-good ending and overall message. Others tuned in because they wanted to find all the answers to the mysteries of the island. I wanted both yet I feel I was cheated out of the latter. If you think about this debate, its actually pretty ironic. ""Lost"" fans are divided just as Jack and Locke were: The Man of Science vs. The Man of Faith. The fans of science want all the answers and the fans of faith don't need them. Fans of faith are content just knowing that our characters moved on to the afterlife. Unfortunately, in the real world, things aren't as black and white as the pieces on a chessboard. A man can relish in both faith and science. Where are the answers for a person like this; a person like myself?

Ultimately, I think it was wrong for the writers to ignore the fans of science all together. They were left with nothing while the fans of faith had all the proof they needed to find closure. Now it feels as if we, the dissatisfied fans, are in a flash-sideways of our own. Were in a limbo of sorts; aimless, looking for something we just cant seem to find. The impending moment of truth that we were waiting for was just a mirage. Now we're forced to accept the reality of what the show actually is rather than what we were led to believe it would be. So, as Jacob would say, now we have a choice. We can either damn ourselves to eternal frustration or make like our beloved Losties and just let go.",1488153600,,6106,4.521266968325792

4076398,1,B0036EH3WU,"Just completed this Christian homily and I am surprised it ever reached TV Land. The U. S is a nation of God fearin' Christians but this is like a mamouthly long bible study on prime time. The cast is bush league , the plot feels as if were  written by somebody on weed who thought it to be genius stuff at the time. Jesus saves and God moves in mysterious ways is the theme here . I only began watching  because I was aware that there is a dog in the cast. Vincent ( the dog ) has next to nothing in screen time but the only really effective moment in this piece belongs to him at the end. All throughout this "" adventure ""  animals are killed without concern . Speciesism on parade .. The overall  cheapness of the production ( including  film's / tv's least scary monster ) is  are you kidding stuff. My favorite absurdity is Said ( A Muslim ? in church smooching it up with Blondie ....what about his former true love ?  ) Then there's ElL Gordo  the lover of mankind who thinks animals are nothing but food ( he's still the best character in the piece dude) . The writing here is so bad that when the hot tamale cop calls Hurley "" Tubby ""  I thought it to be the best piece of dialogue in Lost.  The plot is at its best when it kills off f the most annoying characters  ( tough to kill folks and keep them dead for long though, lots of bringing people back to life especially by Dr. Jack who is so good at everything that he could probably have sex and operate at the same time.  The final sequence at the church where everyone present are just happy as clams to be movin' on. You'd think some of them would be pissed at who or what brought them to the island, right. The old inter racial couple were a hoot...just so pleased to be alone on the island ( with its heat, humidity, insects and boredom ) for years. The inner city "" Black "" guy killed one person by accident and another for what he thought was a good reason ? I forget yet he don'y go to no Heaven, yet he thinks it's right that way. The "" music "" for this series is the worst I've ever heard  , worse than the bah baappa bah stuff from 70's tv movies , and that damned "" You are everybody "" excuse for pop music by Charlie is truly a torture.  How long did Hurley stay on the island ? at least he could plug the drain hole with his big behind if need be, and he did not drop a pound even without his beloved favorite food . Maybe the weirdest sequence was the little guy who killed and lied his way through the six years wanting to stay out of the church for awhile and contemplate the touchdown Jesus statue.  The whole production has the feel of a 70's black comedy played dead pan. It is a one of a kind. I was saddened by the conclusion of Lost. Mostly by the appearance of Vincent who in a few moments brought more dignity and sadness  to death than the entire rest of the 100 plus hours of Lost combined. What in the world ( or out of it ) did those people in church think lay before them ? and why ?  Maybe their characters from the alternative time lines in the production ?  Maybe Vincent and the  animals they killed ?  Maybe  God saying , "" Do it again """,1464393600,,3134,4.038834951456311

Everyone I knew watched the show when it first came out except for me. I finally gave the series a chance around season 3.
The reason I love Lost is because it is a great mix of styles.
It is funny, serious, mysterious, scientific,  psychological and more.
I have never seen such a fantastic show with a fantastic cast and will probably not see another.
I never get tired of watching Lost, and it's easy to discover little things you missed before when you watch them over again.
Just buy it. Each episode you watch draws you in and before you know it you are hooked!",1403395200,3,610,4.304347826086956

The shows twists in the plot lines are just not realistic. The writers tried to make it unexpected and interesting, but its not well done.

I couldn't stand how much everyone lies in this show. Seriously every other scene someone is lying.

Some of the scenes just are just dumb and totally unrealistic (ex: charlie being hung by ethan from a super tall tree, the pregnant woman escaping from ethan, the scene where 3 bad things happen at once: hugo's million dollar mansion catches on fire/mom breaks ankle/cops arrest him all within 30 seconds...)

-Many episodes just drag out way too long for the plots.

I didn't even finish the series and I HAD to have the complete collection! It arrived in a big box and was in perfect condition when it came. When I took it out, it had a paper wrapping across it with a picture of the LOST cast going all around the box. Once the paper was removed, it was a big, plain black box with LOST written in the center. After opening that box, inside was an Egyptian like styled box with a cover that comes off of a map of the island! WAY COOL! Now, I kinda spoil myself trust me I am like queen of spoilers, but I just started season 4 so I have no idea what the Egyptian symbol stuff is supposed to mean but I am loving it! Once the map cover is removed, a smaller box slides out of there with little booklet shaped things that hold the dvds. 6 seasons all with different pictures on the discs, and covers. There is also a few bonus things inside as well. And a mini book that you can flip through with info on the eps and what's inside. Spoilers for me but like I said, spoiler queen!

4076672,5,B0036EH3WU,"It lasted six years and it was adventurous and surprisingly eventful. With Walt Disney and ABC Studios behind the wings, we were expecting a family series and yet at the same time rather strong in plot. And we got what we expected. Right to the end and I must say this last episode The End was not disappointing but totally artificial to give the last kick of life with and to a happy ending though clearly beyond death. The bucket had been kicked a last time long before and everyone was lying alive and well at least six feet underground. That final magic was possible because of two elements in the series, the first one being the axiom of it and the second one being the result of a systematic treatment.

The axiom is that we are stepping beyond the real world into a world that is antipodean to anything we know in real life. It is done with a plane that crosses the wrong line one day and crashes on an island that is not listed on any map. This is close to Stephen Kings Langoliers. Planes are tricky and they can cross such magnetic limits between here and over-there, I mean the real world and the other side of it that is just as alive as ours but in an inverted terrible way with a few holes in the hedge for some rabbits to come in and out.

This island is a traditional myth in American culture and you will like it tremendously. It is a permanently tropical island that is, as we finally learn at the end, volcanic and there is some kind of a cork on top of the lava tap or hole that could destroy the island with a volcanic eruption that would restructure it completely. To make that lava hole or tap a menace to the whole world is maybe excessive but it is magical because we have always been fascinated by this volcanic reality and we are struck with fear every single time we hear about such an eruption. The island is in fact a series of islands, at least two and they are a microcosm of a world in which several projects have been carried out and on which several populations are living in the most hostile way possible.  The themes of the series and this island are numerous.

First a mad science project, the Dharma Initiative that wants to sound Buddhist or Asian and that wants to harness the natural and powerful energy of this volcanic force for the improvement of humanity. First it wants to control the inner force so that it would no longer influence the world, cause catastrophes. That would require the presence of a permanent colony of scientists and technicians to fulfill the task. Other crazy scientific projects exist like about the case of the fertility of women since on this island all pregnant women who were impregnated on the island will die and the baby along with them. Some scientists are brought onto the island to study and solve this problem.

At the same time different people are helping up that initiative or lurking behind it because there is a profit to get out of it, a commercial profit, a scientific profit that might become commercial, etc. The economic vultures are roaming around and over this island. At the same time there could be a medical profit for it because people are cured of their diseases and healed of their wounds on this island, and yet that is not that simple since at least one, Benjamin, develops a nasty cancer there and pregnant women die of their pregnancies. But it is true Benjamin goes out of the island regularly because there is one simple and single way to get out of it: with a submarine. Another mythic element that sends us back to Jules Verne and his 20,000 leagues under the sea.

There are older populations too. First a shipwrecked pregnant woman who will give birth to two twin boys will arrive one day on the island, be saved by another isolated woman who lives away from some local population that lives in very primitive conditions. The latter woman who delivers the two boys kills the mother and raises the two sons as hers. One will remain faithful to her, Jacob; one will move to the other inhabitants and will start building some way to get out of the island. The woman will destroy the village and kill all the inhabitants. Then Jacob will confront his nameless brother, kill him and send him into the volcanic hole that produces light and this brother will be transformed into a smoky revengeful spirit who will only try to get out of the island. Jacob has to select a candidate for his succession because he knows, sooner or later, his brother will manage to find a way to kill him, which happens soon enough.

This nameless spirit can take the form or appearance of a dead person and he uses that trick to assume the body and identity of one of the wrecked passengers from the plane.

Another group that is, as such, rather short-lived is a marooned group of US soldiers who are safe keeping an Atom bomb that was abandoned here. The point is that this group is led by a certain Richard who becomes the direct associate of Jacob and as such eternal (???). Another is named Whitmore who wants to get and take possession of the power in the island to make a profit out of it. Later on a certain Benjamin arrives and will have Whitmore expelled from the island.  This Benjamin was the son of a member of the Dharma Initiative and he will cross the line and go to the US soldiers grown more or less wild, and then with these he will eliminate the people of the Dharma Initiative and he will take their equipment over with the US soldiers and Richard as his own troops.

Then several lines will give Richard a very old origin and bring a Black Rock sail boat on the island, a sort of slave ship. Another scientific mission will get marooned here too and one woman will survive and give birth to a daughter who will be stolen by Benjamin and his troops. You add a couple of polar bears in this tropical island, just for fun, and a lot of boars for food. You make Whitmore plot his come back to recapture the island, the desire of the smoky spirit to get out off the island, the intrigues coming from Jacob to select his candidates and successor, and many other events to make things more complicated and even bring a real jet on the second island and you will be lost in translation, and you will enjoy it.

The second interest of the series is the survival techniques of humans who don't seem to know what cooperation and democracy mean as soon as they are in an emergency situation. The relations between the various members of every single group are explored in detail and whats more they have plenty of opportunity because Benjamin causes a severe disruption to the time line of the island that can shift from one time to another, going back 30 years at one time, while the real world is going on three more years. Those who had escaped had a real like during these three years and most of them are brought back thirty years back onto the island and they manage, without knowing what they are doing, to bring the island back to the time of the main catastrophe that is simply erased from the worlds record and then we have the characters leading normal lives in Los Angeles at year zero while the escapees from the island live a life that goes up to year +3, while on the island, those who were trapped there are living in year -30. And there the escapees from year +3 manage to get themselves back to year -30 where they meet those that had stayed behind on the island and had been transferred thirty years backward. Imagine the situation.

Thats the most important fact of this series, the systematic treatment of the plot and story. It uses all kinds of flash-backs and flash-forwards without any real pedagogical help. We navigate from one time to another, from one group to another, from one place on the island to another and we little by little build a consciousness that gets all the time more abstract and less respectful of any time line at all. We are becoming time-obsessed timeless viewers who enjoy living in some out-of-time meta-time that is like the time line of Mars and Venus merged together forward and backward. This is possible only because we are watching a TV series. That kind of timelessness is nearly impossible with the cinema for instance and would be very difficult with a book. As for that it is a very good TV series because we are able to remain afloat in a time treatment that should drown us in a sea of pebbles bombarding our brains.

The last remark is about life and death. One cannot live but with the memories form the past and what happened, happened. These recollections, even when they become unconscious are always present in your mind and they come back in some flashy impulses sooner or later and repetitively. This is quite true and Sigmund Freud would agree but it is maybe slightly too behavioral for anyones normal taste. People seem to be more or less doomed to start all over again their own mistakes and their own behaviors and actions. The absolute symbol of this impossibility to change is Hugo who no matter where or when he will be fat because he has become fat when he started overeating when his father left him and his mother. The coming back of his father, the winning of a lottery, his sojourn in an island where there was no fat and no chocolate bars, though they managed to get some with the left over resources of the Dharma initiative, he manages to be running around and having an extremely active wild life and yet he does not lose one gram.  But James Sawyer is not better. Jack the doctor is just the same, etc., etc. The best character in that line of behavioral limits is the only Black character and his son: traitor by definition, he betrays several times, manages to sell his companions in exchange of his own return to the outside world, and he will of course find himself in an impossible situation that will lead him to signing up with the wrong chap, Whitmore actually, and finding himself signed up too with Whitmores arch-enemy and being the saboteur employed by Benjamin within the team employed by Whitmore who are supposed to go to the island, recuperate Benjamin and destroy everything and everyone.

I would not say this is racial prejudice but we must say minority people are not exactly saved. There is only one black woman that is worth anything, but she is married to a white dentist. It is amazing how Walt Disney manages to be white dominant when they are producing anything that is supposed to target the majority white family audience. And I will not insist on Sayid, the Iraqi, whose portrait and role are black and bleak and saved in the last final episode by the scruff of his neck.

And then the series can rewrite the Bible over and over again, with two brothers, the elder one killing the younger one and the dead younger one trying to get his vengeance and the elder one being killed by the younger one and then entrusting other humans to finally dispose of the younger one by making him human again and thus able to die or be killed.

And at the end everyone, or nearly everyone, not quite everyone though, can join in some all-faith multi-affiliation church, Buddhists, Muslims and all kinds of Christians, with Jewish symbols but no real Jewish character identified as such. And it is revealed they are all dead, which explain why Claires son Aaron and Sun and Yins daughter are not present: they had been entrusted to other living outsiders in the real world before the mother Sun and the woman Kate who had taken Aaron under her protection in the absence of the mother Claire who had stayed on the island.

Then we come to this vast idea that life is death in this real world and death is life on the virtual side of this real world. We can live happily ever after because we will die and be reborn in full bliss on the virtual side of this real universe, in other words we will be reborn in the cleaned up and conflict-free recollection of the island of extreme adventure and dramatic tragedy. We can see how Walt Disney and their authors are mixing, for all faith alike, but not quite for all human ethnic groups, the Christian, Buddhist and Islamic visions of life after death and life before death reunited in one single reality that does not know what a time line is and prefers a timeless tiered spatial reality. Just get on the lift that will elevate or lower you to the level of this reality you will desire at this or that moment of your mental existence. And don't be afraid the car of the elevator will not crashed with you inside because we are not in Stephen Kings horror after all.

It all sounds like a chapter of Wendy Hui Kyong Chuns book, Programmed Visions that consider the digital subject that gets lost in software knows everything but does not remember, is conscious of all the strata of the multi-tiered mental world but cannot recollect which is real and which is virtual and in what order they come. But Ms Chun is totally mistaken in that reductive misconception . . . or shouldnt I say fearful panic or abortion of reason?

There had been a re-run of some of the episodes on television and she was more fascinated with it the second time around, than the first. She was disappointed when the reruns ended. It enables her to revisit the experience at her leisure and the price for a slightly used version versus a new version, made it hard to pass up.

4076699,3,B0036EH3WU,"Lost is an interesting and disappointing experience. It starts off very interesting, and left me wanting more. When I finished the series, I still wanted more. Lost to me is like many Stephen King novels. They have magnificent setups, but the payoff at the end is usually underwhelming, or absolutely ridiculous. Lost is not bad, but is very underwhelming.

As far as the characters go I have little complaints. All the characters get development, and lots of it. More than half of Lost comprises of flashbacks or flash forwards that develop each individual character. In a way it is a problem, because sometimes it is hard to tell who the main protagonist is. Jack is supposedly the main character, but at times Benjamin or Locke feel more like the main character. Benjamin and John Locke are my favorite characters in the series. They by far the most interesting characters in the story. However, the main villain of the story, in my opinion is a bit inconsistent and underdeveloped.

The production values are great. The special effects that are used are decent as well. I really got sucked into this world.

The big problem with Lost is that it sets up a lot of questions and plot elements but gives no satisfying answers, or no answers at all. The first two seasons were the best. They had a lot of mystery and intrigue. Season three and beyond were still enjoyable (except season six), but the sense of mystery was mostly gone and it did not feel the same. Season six was an utter mess. Season six, being the final season was supposed to wrap everything up, but instead raised more questions while giving very few answers. The answers they do give are lame. The finale was horrible, leaving many things unexplained.

Overall, Lost is a decent show, but does not live up to the hype it builds.",1366761600,,1798,4.680379746835443

4076740,3,B0036EH3WU,"I'm sure that if this review ever gets read it will rack up mostly ""not helpful"" judgments. Yes, the ""not helpful"" judgment that nine times out of ten really is a ""I don't agree with you"" judgment. But here goes....My wife and I watched Lost religiously from start to finish. At times, it seemed as if a good portion of our lives revolved around it -- discussing not only the story but storytelling technique and character realization and, well, all the fundamentals of that human monument called fiction. There were hooks galore, complications and connections that seemed so delicious, and The Big Mystery that lay there, covered by that metaphorical tarp that someday we just knew would be thrown aside to display the glorious fictional construct underneath, shining in all its glory. What a load of crap that turned out to be. My reaction parallels exactly that of another reviewer who chose to give this series only one-star. I give it three, because overall it's okay. It is a wonderful ride for most of the run. There are ups and downs, of course. The flashback stories became repetitive: Yet one more escape for Kate, another paternal betrayal of Locke, and so on. And as the layers peeled off, it seemed as if we weren't going deeper into the mystery, just sideways. In the end -- in that stupid, uninspired end -- we found out there wasn't anything at all under the tarp. No payoff, which is to my mind one of those fundamental elements of fiction. The creator and audience enter into a silent pact, an agreement that says I'll take some time from you, but the time will be spent on a wondrous journey that will leave you in a place you'll be glad you visited. Well, the journey was rather wondrous most of the time, but as the cliche goes, when we got to the end there was no there there. The producers never knew where they wanted to go; they just made it up on the fly, creating one stopgap after another, until time finally ran out. If enough time has elapsed so that you aren't particularly aware of the details of this series, you might still rent or check out from a library one season after another. Enjoy the trip, but be forewarned that it leads nowhere.",1349654400,7,2173,4.560102301790281

The boxed set is rather large, but the presentation and packaging of the DVDs and extra gifts is impressive. If you like Lost, I suggest you get this boxed set.",1348963200,,409,4.694444444444445
4076742,4,B0036EH3WU,"LOST is a pioneer in so many things. It has a movie quality production value, amazingly written with some of the most enduring characters in TV series history and the twists and turns keep you guessing. There is continuity and progression of narratives and character developments that are often lacking in other lenghty syndication.

The mythology is full of puzzles and it's fun to explore and theorize what is what, or when events actually occurred. Unlike The X-Files, another favourite show, LOST myths enrich and move the main stories forward. It never loses its focus on the characters and the completion of the characters self-discoveries.

Whilst Season 2 & 3 are mired by some lackluster episodes and characters, the rest of the show is pure mint.

In hindsight however, this show could've benefited from perhaps another season, in order to develop the new characters intoduced late in the series. Season 6 for example, at times felt rushed with some plot devices never explained, while a few characters are simply killed off without any flashbacks to their past nor further character development. I'd have loved to delve further into characters like Charlotte, Daniel and Miles. The show writers hinted at Charlotte Lewis being a central figure that might unveil the mysteries behind the island's ancient civilisations, but this was never explored at all in the end. Another character, Ilana, seems to have a connection with Jacob and the Taweret statue. But again that trail led to another shocking dead end.

An episode about who put the Egyptian hieroglyphs or built the Temple would be nice. Better still, how about giving us some clues about what is the deal with the Heart of the Island or the Sumerian pictographs on the Cork. That would've been better explained rather than leaving them as red herrings or another production error.

The box set itself is a nifty representation of the show, with gimmicks and surprises that reward fans. A top notch package design with excellent print quality and even a hidden bonus disc. Kudos to the designers.

So all in all here's a salute to Lindelof, Cuse, Abrams and their team of directors and writers for giving us this amalgamation of genres with care and attention to details: sci-fi, mysteries, ancient civilizations, faith vs science, fate vs free will, conspiracies and many more.

This review is missing a star because Season 3 & 4 are not multi region coded. ABC should've really stood up for its name sake and allow access for region A, B & C. If you are a fan, get this set.",1348531200,,2544,4.888631090487239

4076744,5,B0036EH3WU,"I'm giving five stars to all six seasons of Lost because I enjoyed every single episode. Sure, I enjoyed some more than others, but every episode provoked an emotional reaction: a laugh, misty eyes, or a surprised ""wow."" The characters are sharply defined and the acting is uniformly strong. I can't think of another series in which I altered my opinion of the characters so frequently. Characters I disliked turned out to be admirable, while characters who initially seemed admirable turned out to be sketchy. My favorite character changed from week to week and, while watching one die was always upsetting, the feeling of loss was ameliorated by the rise of another.

Unlike some naysayers who think a disappointing ending to the series destroys the value of each episode that preceded it, I'm not prepared to forget how frequently I was captivated, and moved, by the stories that were told about the individual lives of the island's inhabitants. And if I may be so bold as to disagree with those who think the writers of the series got ""lost"" along the way, it seems to me that the story follows a coherent arc. There are scenes in season one that attain no significance until season six. That reflects careful planning, not off-the-cuff writing.

My sole gripe about Lost is that it incorporates a supernatural/mystical/religious element that, although central to the story, is not something to which I can easily relate. I'm not a big fan of the supernatural. It's just too easy to use the supernatural to explain phenomena when, with more difficulty and imagination, a reality-based explanation might be concocted. The ""smoke monster"" that turns up from time to time, the good versus evil theme, the deliberate confusion as to whether Jason or Locke might be the devil, all struck me as misplaced. The serious religious overtones of the final episode are just unnecessary. This could have been told as a time travel story with characters living parallel lives on and off the island without getting hokey about ""what comes next."" The attempt to meld science fiction and mysticism almost never works, and the effort to do so in Lost weakens the overall story. Having said that, I reaffirm my belief that displeasure with the series' resolution does not change the immense pleasure I felt watching the individual episodes that led up to it.",1347408000,,2343,4.9291139240506325

4076748,5,B0036EH3WU,"This show moved me to the point that ""regular"" TV will no longer be the same.

I ""discovered"" it online 2 weeks ago and streamed it 1/2 a season a day. I thought Terry O'Quinn deserved an Emmy, I checked and see he got one.

I thought the leads a bore though... and after 4 years not even very likeable. I don't think they can act. Not the pretty ones. Kate, Jack and Sawyer... who cares! Locke was hypnotic. Benjamin Linus was played grandly and that actor won a well deserved Emmy. When Ben apologized to Locke in the finale... I cried. And when Locke forgave him... I had to pause the stream and re-group.

For me Lost was all about the island and those who knew it not the self-involved Kate/Jack/Sawyer and later Juliet 4-some. The Ben/Locke/island relationship was what kept me hooked.

Locke is the best Colonel Kurtz since Colonel Kurtz!!

I give the finale a lot of slack but no matter how I think it I can't figure why Penny is ""there."" It was a great journey though.",1344124800,,977,4.375690607734807
4076749,3,B0036EH3WU,"I was a huge fan of LOST. I managed to avoid watching the episodes when first aired in order to enjoy each season in a LOST-binging weekend, when the DVDs were released. What a disappointment was waiting for us at the end!

>>>>>> SPOILERS AHEAD <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

I started watching LOST for the deep personal stories that touched and interweaved with each other unexpectedly and mysteriously. I continued to watch LOST because of the paranormal mysteries that were hinted of having very normal explanations. Well, maybe not normal but at least logical. What was the Black Smoke? Why is Ben so important? Do the dead resurrect on the Island like Jack's father or dead means dead, like Ben's daughter? Why can it there be no children getting born on the Island? What do the Numbers mean? How was Lock able to walk again and why did he have to die at the end? Why did the statue have four fingers? And what about the polar bears, the one on the island and the other fossilized with a Dharma collar in ancient Egyptian ruins.

As it turns out, the creators of the series had no clue whatsoever. They kept throwing PostIts with ancient, urban and and religious mythology on the board and THEN they tried to mold the resulting pulp of ideas into a narrative. This way, something was bound to catch your interest every week. Yet, they had no idea where the story was going. Not even at the end. Well, especially at the end.

I gave the series an extra star because of the very intriguing and absorbing seasons 1 through 5. The problem with Season 6 of LOST was that, during the previous seasons, it had hooked us with so many lines that we expected either a fish or at least some uneaten bait at the end of them. Most of these lines simply ended, never to be picked up ever again.

No deeper meaning. No logical explanation that can tie around everything. Just a luminous steampunk spring that ""is important"".

I could not put it in words until I came across Jonathan McCalmont's Blog, Ruthless Culture: LOST was nothing but CalvinBall. An imaginary game whose rules are made up as we play along. No one keeps score, no one plans ahead, no one wins.

I did not expect the creators of LOST to provide serious answers to life's cardinal questions.
I did expect them to answer their own d@mn questions, though!",1341964800,,2360,4.699757869249395

4076773,4,B0036EH3WU,"With over 300 reviews its difficult to add anything not already covered.  Rather than attempt to rate the show of such a fantastic franchise years after its been off the air, I'll just say that this is one of the most amazing and influential TV series I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  I'd recommend that EVERYONE watch the pilot anyway they can and if they find it enjoyable, then this purchase will be well worth their money.

But, I do want to discuss the problems I have with the actual packaging of this great show as a ""buyer beware"" section.  While it likely isn't enough to make you avoid the purchase, there are some frustrations that may lead you to the standard seasons instead of this complete collection.

First, The actual discs are in a cardboard binder.  It pains me to slide out a disc on cardboard.  But the other problem is the size of the case.  Its 25 - 45% taller than a standard DVD case.  So you can't store this on a DVD shelf without turning it on its side.  This is the actual DVD case removed from the odd shaped box the extras are stored in.  I'm going to buy a multi-disc binder to keep them in, which is a bit of a shame for this nice collector's set.

The ankh was a bit disappointing as it feels like very shallow plastic and easily separates in the middle.  If you actually wanted to display this, it isn't smooth enough on the bottom to stand up on its own and it comes apart too easily to wear as a necklace (plus, the place where it separates is very noticeable, even at medium distance).

Next, the features on the disc are organized in a very frustrating way.  Items are not listed, they have to be scrolled through.  What's worse, completely unnecessary items are in the way.  Once you choose to watch ""episodes"" over ""features"" you are then prompted for the season.  Keep in mind you already inserted the disc to get to this point.  If you scroll to another season, it politely tells you to insert that disc.  Why?  Then, every time you start watching an episode you are asked if you want to use the feature that remembers where you left off.

Additionally, there are many load screens and splash screens at the insert of each disc (one of which is a warning that some screens may take long to load).  The first disc, season 1, had multiple advertisements for the Lost series.  This was frustrating as I had purchased the entire series in a nice collector's set and was not expecting the same advertisements from the standard DVD that sold over 6 years ago.  So, after watching commercials and multiple loading/splash screens, you then have to click 4 buttons to get the show started each time (not counting the scrolling of episodes since they don't list in a menu).  With only 4 episodes on a disc, I am thinking this could have easily been organized into a more user friendly fashion.

Finally, the commentary is what I was most excited about and am now equally disappointed over.  In a show shrouded in mystery and secrets which left epic details unanswered... I was giddy over hearing director/writer/actor comments that would explain some of what was going on.  No show has ever had me wanting commentary more than this one.  Sadly, after viewing the firs 10 commentaries, I've seen little other than stating the obvious, (i.e. ""this is a great scene, the actor did a good job here""), joking with other cast members (while funny at times, it adds nothing to the Lost cannon or helps with understanding the episodes in any way), or talking over the scenes with information that has nothing to do with show or content at all.  To be fair, I am enjoying the commentary, but given this series, its quite a waste of time.

In summary, I'm enjoying one of the best TV moments in the history of television while I watch this set of discs, but I'm also disappointed at the treatment the physical media and contents received.",1336003200,5,3870,4.515804597701149

4076776,1,B0036EH3WU,"My wife and I loved this series and watched all six seasons over the 6 years it aired.  I decided to purchase this box set as a Christmas gift for her.  BIG MISTAKE, and here is why.  We started watching season 1 beginning in February, 2012.  In season 1 there is 7 discs, with disc 7 being a special feature disc.  We got to the season 1, two-part season finale and bam, right in the middle of the two-part finale, (Exodus, part 1 of 2), the disc would not play.  We have 5 dvd players throughout our home.  It didn't work on any of them.  So, no question that this is a defective disc.  I contact Amazon, and of course I get someone in the Philippines who I can hardly understand.  I'm trying to explain to her that this set has 39 discs, and that you wouldn't know if there was a problem until you actually had one.  A defective disc could occur in season 1 up to season 6, and anything in between as well.  In this case, the first defect for us was in the first season, disc # 6, (photo of the character ""Sun"" on the disc).  Who knows how many of the other 33 discs remaining are defective as well?  The Amazon rep tells me that we are past the window of returning the set, and I could only return the set up to January 31, 2012.  I asked her how the in the world were we supposed to watch all 39 discs in a month?!  After arguing with her for an hour and half on the phone until 1:30 am in the morning, she agreed to make an ""exception"".  How nice... you're so kind!  I was informed that if we had another problem with any of the discs after receiving the replacement set, we were stuck with it.  Yeah, right, NOT happening!  This is a really nice box set with all sorts of extras included.  The problem is, if you have an issue down the line, as you could because you're going to watch them in order, and won't know if you have a defective disc until it happens, then you're stuck with a defective set.  The replacement set is arriving tomorrow, 2/29/12, and I'm going to call Amazon as soon as it gets here and send it and the defective set back. NO WAY we're getting stuck down the line with possibly more defective discs.  The only alternative is to buy each season separately and watch them within 30 days.  Then if you have a problem you're in the window for a return/exchange or refund.  It stinks because the purpose of a collector's set is to have all of the seasons together in a set.  Hence the title, ""Lost: The Complete Collection"".  Amazon should review their policy regarding sets of this size.  How can you possibly check 39 discs from beginnig to end within 30 days unless you have no life and no job, and sit in front of the television 7 days a week!  Hello, it has 39 discs, wake up Amzon and be realistic!!!  Thumbs down on this purchase!  If you purchase this set, you can easily fall into the same return trap that we did!

4076797,4,B0036EH3WU,"What's that? You have an opinion of the television show LOST already formed in your brain case? Such a shame as I had quite a fantastic exploration of the show and all of its intricate subplots and themes. But, since you already know what you think about the show, I won't... okay I'll stop being lame. Look, LOST invaded our every waking thoughts (err..?) because of how wildly different it was than anything else on TV. It had mystery, mystery, Dharma beer, smoke monsters, and--most important to me, although many of you will probably say ""you're only just saying that to not feel like you were raped for 6 seasons""--deeply fascinating character arcs. What allowed it to transcend the sophomore curse was being different every year, making each season stand apart from the previous while maintaining a core identity throughout the entire run. It was always LOST, but it went from being a stranded-on-a-scary-island show to being a holy-what-the-F show (simply put, of course). So now that that's out of the way, here are my experiences with the box set.

The box itself is as massive as all the other reviews have made it out to be. Do you have a PS3 slim? The LOST box set is bigger than that (if I had to guess, I'd say maybe 15% bigger but who knows). Take all the guts out of the LOST box and you could fit your PS3 inside the box. If you don't have a PS3 slim, then I'm sorry I don't have a measuring tape within my reach. The upside to the massive box: it stands out. It has cool art. It's detailed--at this size it'd have to be so you know it's worth your money. The downside is, of course, that it won't fit on your standard shelf (probably--it doesn't fit on mine). So it'll have to go somewhere out in the ""open"" and you're pretty much forced to show it off. If you don't like that idea, you can always get a disc-gear to store the discs and just put the box in the closet, but...

WHY would you want to hide this box?? You take off the lid and it's like a treasure chest. You have your episode guide, which to me is underwhelming--it's dark, brief, very few pictures, and doesn't list the bonus material. You pull that out and you have the actual BD sets which come in a box probably 12 x 7 (or something). Within that box are 6 slim cardboard foldouts, each with discs in disc-slots. YUCK. I hate this method of storage, which is why I store my discs elsewhere--more on that later. (I still display the case on my out-in-the-open shelf because it is that cool looking.) But there's more! On either side of where the BD box is stored, there are side storage areas. On the one side you will find game pieces for the game that Jacob and his brother played, as well as an Ankh. On the other side you'll find a Dharma blacklight and an old-looking letter, ala Richard Alpert. Yeah they're just trinkets and probably aren't worth a dime, but they're cool! What's really cool about the box though is the underside of the lid which is a raised map of the Island. Finally, the glyphs (or whatever they are) around the edges of the box make it look like an old tomb of sorts, something that could have been buried in the island somewhere.

Enough about the box. You don't care about the box probably, maybe. Maybe you do. I'd talk about it more but...

The bonus disc has a couple very cool features but I almost hate to talk about it because that's against the nature of the show! It's hidden (of course, and quite cleverly) so that's all I'll say. It's worth it--it's not enough to justify selling off your season sets and getting this box set, but it's definitely cool. If you're in that boat, try to find a friend who has the complete series set.

My only genuine complaint, honest to goodness, comes from the cardboard-slot disc storage. Luckily for me, only one of the discs was damaged. Season 1 disc 2 had problems on 2 episodes. You have a couple routes to take if this happens to you. 1) Contact Amazon for a replacement set. I didn't want to take this route, because what if the replacement ended up having 2 bad discs? Forget that. 2) Contact Disney (contactus@disneystudiohelp.com) and they're very cool, although slow (roughly a month), to replace your disc at no charge. So that's why I rated 4-stars. Even though I got my problem disc replaced, I still don't like the slot-storage method!

Overall I'm really pleased with this set. The show looks fantastic on BD and it was nice to re-watch the series marathon-style. The mysteries of course are fantastic, but the depth of the character arcs make LOST a show that you can watch numerous times and still care about.",1327017600,,4586,4.466587112171838

4076806,5,B0036EH3WU,"Lost was, for six years, one of the most addictive (and perhaps best ever) television shows to ever capture the American audience.  Billed as part mystery, part science fiction, part supernatural, part action-adventure, it was a serialized drama which like soap-operas required dedicated viewing in order to follow and understand the plots and characters.  However, unlike its daytime namesakes in serial-drama, Lost was the most expensive television series made, and the creative team led by JJ Abrams wrote and directed the most complex, twisted, and believably human character situations ever to grace the ""boob-tube"".  Lost was not an exercise in weekly entertainment, it was captivating, thought-provoking, yes it was ""intelligent"" (a way overused word), and again...addictive beyond belief.  Echoed everywhere in reviews, the end of Lost was both the culmination of high imagination and the sudden cold turkey of millions of fans.  Thankfully, this Lost Complete Series set, boxed in an ultra-imaginative set for the devoted fan, complete with mysteries in packaging and toys for the ber-fan is available.
The Bluray Hi-Def picture and sound are fantastic, deep, rich, and a feast for the eyes and ears.  Watching Lost again, in this way, is like participating in the world's longest movie.  The ""Season Play"" mode allows you to leave the viewing at any point and automatically resume your viewing at the exact location, even if you turned off your system and removed the disc to watch something else in-between.  Watching Lost this way is so gratifying without having to wait a week for the next installment and forgetting things, you appreciate Lost so much more than ever before, and you might not believe how much you had forgotten since the first season aired.  Opening the packaging, shaped as ""The Temple"", and exploring all the surprises which come with the discs is pure fun, re-living the complete series episodes is engaging in the world's longest sci-fi thriller movie, and watching this series in Bluray perfect high-definition with complete theater surround is an eyes and ears extravaganza.  Can't give enough praise to this boxed set!  It was the perfect gift!",1326412800,,2182,5.241379310344827
4076807,4,B0036EH3WU,"My undying love for Lost aside, I am really not impressed with all the extra little trinkets in the box set.  I am not that excited over the board game and the ankh and the Black Rock diary excerpt.  It seems aimed at younger viewers (I am 54). I also think the DVD package could have been done better.  I would have paid the same price for something a little more compact and streamlined.  But of course, it's Lost, so it's still great!",1326153600,,437,4.228915662650603

4076811,5,B0036EH3WU,"JJ Abrams is a force to be reckoned with. Based on his work on Alias, Tom Cruise handpicked him to direct Mission Impossible 3. Getting his start with Taking Care of Business, he went on to write Regarding Henry, Gone Fishin', Armageddon, and Joy Ride before going on to create his first TV series Felicity. Taking his pedigree to another level he opted to create the series Alias, and because the studio was so please with the results they asked Abrams for a show they could practically tag: Survivor/Castaway: The Series. They had worked with another writer, and they didn't care for what he came up with, so with Abrams success they asked him.

To give Abrams all the credit for Lost isn't really fair. Abrams brought in Damon Lindeloff and they went to work creating something of a long term plan and a pilot. In the end, Abrams wouldn't have had anything to do with the show beyond the season 3 premiere of the show. Early on Carlton Cuse came on as show runner, taking Abrams place. Lindeloff and Cuse still worked with the template that Lindeloff and Abrams set and that template created a global zeitgeist. Until the end of the series, Lost remained a highly watched show and a critical darling.

I have to be honest and say that I didn't jump on to the Lost train until late into the show's run. After the 5th season a good friend of mine lent me all five seasons to help me catch up. Needless to say I was hooked from the start. The pilot episode alone was made for $10-14 million (which happened to get ABC exec Lloyd Braun sacked), when most pilots are made for $4 million. If it weren't for that the story of the characters would have hooked me instantly. In all honesty, that's what kept me coming back and what satisfied me in the end.

Lost gets a lot of recognition for its mythology, but Lost remains brilliant because it is rooted in humanity. Through every Sci-Fi, fantasy, and religious twist of the series, there are always the characters that help the audience to ground itself. The brilliant performance of Matthew Fox (who plays Jack Shepherd), Josh Holloway (James Sawyer), Jorge Garcia (Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes), and Evangeline Lilly (Kate Austen) among others help you to connect to each of these characters and follow them through the series no matter what they face. In a series that is full of mythology that can seem `otherworldly', that is very important.

As much as Lost is a human story it is also mired in aforementioned mythology. While season one is almost practically straightforward with the plight of the passengers of Oceanic 815, even season two doesn't deviate too far from the path of season one, we as an audience begin to see the cracks in the lining. This isn't meant to be a bad statement it's just that Lost jumps far beyond the typical TV show. The first couple of seasons are strictly drama before the latter four seasons delve into fantasy, Sci-Fi, and even religion. With its religious tones, Lost isn't overbearing, nor is it sacrilegious. You can tell that the writers have taken religious idealism seriously and they don't opt to trivialize it or pick a particular religious affiliation to align the show with.

A lot of people were disenchanted by the last season of the show, feeling that the show runners never really had a plan for the show and came up with the least satisfying ending they could think of. I'm not part of this group. Lindeloff and Cuse have admitted that they had a broad outline that allowed them to expand on elements of the Lost-verse through time; also they were pressured to expand the series beyond their initial intentions. Even with those admissions though, the ending they came up with I found extremely satisfying for the purpose of tying up the loose strings where the characters are concerned. While they might not have tied up all the strings of the mysteries of Lost mythology, I feel that doing so was unnecessary for what the series was initially going for, which was a human story.

When I discussed it with a friend who had seen it, he told me the show is good but the ending is terrible so just miss the last season. Well, I have just seen the last season, and I liked that too. I think it is a fine ending.

Another good reason I will not buy the kindle fire (and I am looking for a tablet) cause I expect similar nonsense on other products they sell. Would never expect this from Apple

It's worth watching from the beginning, as a lot of themes won't mean much to you unless you watched from the beginning.

This blu ray set is great. I have not dabbled at all with the extras (blacklight flashlight, game board, etc.). I couldn't care less for them.

The blu ray discs are in fold out pamphlets. These pamphlets are stored in a thin, tall, cardboard case. They are not in your typical blu ray cases, and the size is awkward for storage. I actually like how the discs are stored, it is easy to take out a season, open the pamphlet, and take the disc you need. Keep in mind, if you have a blu ray or DVD collection at home, the cardboard box will not likely fit in with your collection.

Do not buy this crap.  Damon Lindelof is a hack.  Carlton Cuse is worse than that.  J.J. Abrams must wish his name was not on this product.",1308009600,9,336,4.593220338983051
4076890,5,B0036EH3WU,"Lost is entertaining and also thought-provoking and evocative. The music, character development, beginnings and endings, separations and reunification reeled me in. The characters' emotional experiences of deep love and hate, battling good and evil within themselves and clinging to or letting go of their pasts and future mirrors the complexity of real-life relationships. Lost contains a little something from all genres: romance, espionage, mystery, sci-fiction, suspense, drama, etc. It brings to life issues of trust, betrayal, friendship, loyalty, abandonment, avoidance, worthiness, sacrifice, etc.

I will say a few things about the packaging.  I am also disappointed, as one other reviewer was, that this was not packaged in standard Blu Ray packaging.  I've had this problem with an X-Files 60-some-odd DVD set.  It was stored in a paper ""book"", which was really no protection at all.  Packaging for Lost is similar with this product.  I feel the necessity to buy some empty cases to protect my DVDs.  So with the Lost Blu Rays.  In fact, you can buy them here at Amazon at:  [...]

There is a bonus disc, where the titles of the bonus selections are listed here in the description, but it was difficult to find.  My brilliant little 9-year-old Seth saw the Ankh with the cryptic pictures inside of it and concluded that there must be some meaning to it.  He figured out that it had something to do with the lid and in following  the paper, he was able to find the hidden Blu Ray disc in the cover of the cover!  What a smartie!  Maybe I'm just dense!

Then there's the ancient Egyptian game Senet, for which rules can be found on the Internet.  It was so interesting to find such an ancient game, still surviving through the millennia.  Archaeologists think they have figured out several different possible ways in which it can be played.  My boys were just having a ball.  You can use the black light to see things on the playing board that you would not otherwise be able to see!

All-in-all, a great purchase.  I would only say please replace your disc book with a special set of disc holders and put your discs in them.  You can do this for $8.00 for 10 of them on Amazon, a great prics.",1306800000,,1756,4.348765432098766

4076908,5,B0036EH3WU,"I'm a fan of the show, but I didn't buy the individual boxes of each season because I was expecting a collector edition of the complete series.

I checked on the web and I saw this wonderful product coming out in the U.S. I just had to wait for it to come out in my country, so I waited, and I learnt that a so called collector box would come out, but not the same as the American one. Let me tell you what it's like : the original individual boxes of each season (meaning all in a different color) gathered and put into some as-thin-as-paper crappy cardboard, and that's about it! How ridiculous! Moreover, it costs 220 dollars!

I didn't hesitated long and just bought the collector on amazon.com, and I don't regret it! What an outstanding quality, the texture of the box, the pictures, the items, the DVD and their contents, everything's just perfect! And it's so much cheaper than the french one!

I wasn't sure about the languages available on the DVD, but you can watch it in English and also in French, with or without the subtitles, all you need is a zone 1 or multi zone DVD player.

The only drawback is that it took ages to reach me, I don't know why exactly because Amazon sent it like the day after my order... But it was definitely worth waiting!
I'm so glad I finally received it and I have one of my favorite shows eternalized in such a wonderful box!",1304553600,,1368,4.33203125

Never once did I tire of the show, the characters, or the story. This is more than I can say for most shows that I love to watch.
When the show ended I couldn't believe it, it was a wild ride and I wanted to watch it all again.

Thankfully, I can, and in amazing Blu-ray quality!

This collection is just amazing, this is truly how a entire series should be released when it comes out, the creators did a phenomenal job making this box set! The black box itself is able to sit sturdily on a shelf with everything housed within without worry of it tipping over or falling off due to a shock to a shelving unit.
The actual case that the LOST Blu-Ray discs are housed in is amazing, it holds not only a game, a note with a clue, a black light pen, and a hidden dvd, but it just looks amazing! This is truly a center piece for any dvd/bluray collection!

I love everything about this release, I have never been more excited and happy to own a complete television collection like I am with the LOST complete collection on BluRay.",1304294400,,1180,4.18942731277533

4076911,5,B0036EH3WU,"I never saw Lost when it was on TV, and then my son bought the DVDs separately and I watched them after he was finished. I was mesmerized; I immediately became an instant Lost fan.  The anticipation of waiting for the DVDs from my son was driving me crazy. After watching the last DVD I couldn't believe there was no more ""Lost"" to watch. I literally was having ""Lost"" withdrawal.

And so, I purchased ""Lost: The Complete Collection"" and watched every minute of ""Lost"" again.  I just finished, and I am already having ""Lost"" withdrawal. Watching it a second time you pick up things you didn't in the firsr go around.

The actors picked to play the roles of Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley, and all the other regulars were perfect for the parts they played.  The story grips you from the beginning and you get ""lost"" in the story.  You can't wait to see the next DVD.  The story led me to wonder what exactly would I have done in a situation like the ones the characters found themselves in. It makes you think about whether you would be strong enough to be one of the survivors.

The product that I purchased is wonderful.  Even the box holding the DVDs, a booklet with descriptions of the different scenes and the game Jacob and his brother played are wonderful.

I would not hesitate in the least to purchase this product, but alas there are no more DVDs to watch, and I know I will be watching a third time because the storyline grips you and holds you interest and attention from the first DVD until the last.",1303430400,2,1508,4.431159420289855
4076942,5,B0036EH3WU,"==SPOILERS==

I remember the commercials for a show featuring a bunch of people stranded on an island, though I never gave it a second thought.  ""All the good television shows have long since passed"" I would say to myself.  ""Nothing can ever be that good on TV anyways"" Eventually I purchased a subscription to Netflix and saw Season 1 of LOST as one of the instant watchable movies.  So I figured, why not? It honestly took me about 3 days before I could actually get myself to sit through the pilot episode.  I kept thinking to myself, ""This is just castaway with more people.""  Eventually I made a point to myself to at least sit through the pilot completely before I gave it up completely.  At the end of the credits, I was blown away.  I didn't actually get into LOST until the break between Season 5 and 6, but it was only a matter of months before I was finally caught up with the rest of the world.  I ran to the living room intently every Wednesday night and watched as the mysteries unfolded even more.  The night finally came for the Finale and I remember sitting at the screen with my jaw dropped and tears in my eyes.  It was beautiful, it was magnificent.  It was everything I ever wanted it to be.

Lost had it's mysteries, Which I thoroughly enjoyed.  But what Lost also had, was the characters.  This show was the very first show I have ever experienced that dug so deeply into the lives of these characters, so much so to the point that if something were to ever happen to them, you honestly felt like you had lost a best friend.  I can honestly say that before Lost, I never let a character death get me down.  I would just pass it off as saying, ""man that sucks."" But when I watch Lost, even after my constant rewatches, I find myself glued to the television set in the hopes that they won't pass away the same way, almost feeling helpless as though I could save them but can't.  That's how deep these characters have become intertwined within my own life.

Even after the show is long since gone, I will forever find myself coming up with theories and ideas about what I think happened next, as well as the mysteries that weren't answered.  I'm honestly glad that the producers didn't give in to the fans demands.  I'm glad they had a story to tell, and told it their way, rather than giving in to people who honestly don't realize what they want.  Had they given away all the answers, we likely wouldn't have liked the answers given, and in that sense, it gives us the ability to keep the show in our hearts and minds as the years pass, constantly wondering ""Who built the statue?"", ""What is the source?"", ""What happened after Hurley and Ben took over as protectors?"" We won't get these answers because only our imaginations hold the key to these answers.  And I'm ok with that.

After all is said and done, I can say Lost has been the most amazing experience for me.  I've even made it a plan of my own to have the Island from Lost be my heavenly paradise when I depart from this world, as I myself am a man of faith.  I've even gone so far as to plan it out as me living the life of the characters on the island all the way up into the end, and when the light gets restarted at the source, that is when I ""wake up"" as the losties did in the sideways world, and remember my time here on Earth.  Using Lost as my greatest inspiration, I'll have a memory I will cherish for eternity, and I'll bring that admiration and inspiration into my next life as well.

Thank you Lost, thank you for giving me hope again.  Thank you for providing me not with entertainment, but a way of life.",1303344000,2,3602,4.294814814814814

4076944,5,B0036EH3WU,"I did not order this from amazon, I received it as a gift, but Lost in my opinion is the best TV series ever. Having it in high definition blu ray makes it even more amazing! There are many special features and a hidden bonus disc. I think there are quite a few hidden ""easter eggs"" included on the discs but I haven't taken the time to find them all yet.

4076945,4,B0036EH3WU,"The good: It's LOST, and it's one of the best shows ever. And it's on blu-ray, so it's very high quality. I've only watched about 8 episodes so far and I haven't delved into any bonus features on the discs. It does come in some very neat looking packaging and includes fun extras like a map and a board game.

The bad: Each disc (at least in season one) has a bunch of dumb crap*  at the beginning that you have to hit the ""next chapter"" button to skip. You should be able to, but cannot use the ""top menu"" button. But the real problem is that there is stupid stuff at the beginning in the first place. The next issue is the packaging. Although the packaging is really cool looking, it's not convenient. It's huge and can't fit on a shelf with other DVDs/blu-rays. Each season is in a sleeve that folds out into four panels or so. The discs are in little ""pockets."" My problem with this is that you have to slide the discs in and out... in my experience scratches of some kind are unavoidable no matter how careful you are with this sort of setup. I've heard that blu-ray discs don't scratch as easily as DVDs/CDs, but I'd still prefer a case of some kind that will better protect my investment. I did pay a fair penny for this set, after all.

Conclusion: This set was worth getting, since it was less than buying each season separately. So long as you're okay with the strange packaging and are careful with the discs. Maybe I'm just nitpicking, but I wish it could be even better.

*One of the annoying things at the beginning of the disc is an advertisement for this new thing called ""blu-ray disc"" that you might want to look into... after you get done watching the blu-ray disc that is currently in your blu-ray player. Why is this advertisement on the disc? It's stupid.",1302393600,,1777,4.359516616314199

I was currently watching the series again and am not at season 5 and it is really amazing how it looks in HD and it gives you the vibe of the series even more.

The reason i got it out of america was the way they package it here in europe.. The extra features are just not worth the money that way. Also the box looks and even feels(it has a relief on it) so awesome! And the lid with the map of the island is also a really neat thing. If you are a true lost fan like i am.. you should really consider buying it! It is really expensive but i mean ... 36 blu-ray discs aren't cheap! and all those extra's make it worth it even more if you are into that kinda thing.

Also the dvd menu's are fun to look at. nice hd scenes from the series but then from another angle. really like what they have done with it.

The packaging is awesome. I love complete collections and I had waited to buy any seasons because I was waiting for this to come out... and it was worth the wait.

4076950,5,B0036EH3WU,"With the conclusion of the greatest sci-fi drama, LOST, life has become meaningless for many Losties like myself, since the show's bittersweet ending.
It all began with Oceanic Flight 815 departing from Sydney to Los Angeles, a flight like any other; a plane full of strangers. But on route to its destination, something goes wrong. The flight crashes onto a mysterious island leaving only 48 surviving passengers. They're complete strangers, stranded on a faraway island, scared, and waiting for any sign of hope. But the only thing more mysterious than the people they are stranded with, is the island itself...along with the encounter with a polar bear in the jungle, the island natives called ""The Others,"" the hatch, the black smoke monster, the whispers heard in the forests, the ""Numbers"": 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42, the Dharma Initiative, the island's ability to move through time, the flashbacks, flash-forwards, flash-sideways into alternate realities, and too many other mind-boggling island mysteries.
One of the greatest and rare things about LOST is how it leaves you to question things like, let's say, how in the world a polar bear can appear in a jungle. But this happens to be the beauty of LOST, because it challenges you to question, ""Well, how could that be? Or why is that?"" leaving you to form your own ideas and hypothesize how these polar bears arrived at the island in the first place. But of course, LOST is not just about the polar bears. The show ties in these serious ideas of the human condition and struggle, what our purpose in life is, faith vs. science, free will vs. destiny, survival, redemption, and on a less serious note, how many times Hurley says the word ""Dude"" in LOST (which happens to be 328 times!) You can further look up how the mysteries on the island unfold along with the show's themes and character analyses as many other LOST nerds do, by checking out lostpedia.com, an encyclopedia site where fellow Losties unite to discuss the mythology of the show, create theories, and dissect hidden codes that they discover in the week's episode.
It's incredibly difficult to find a show that is as captivating and challenging on a philosophical and scientific level as LOST is in entertainment media of today. As a proud LOST fan, I love seeing fellow hardcore Losties promoting the show. For example, I recently found out that 9,078 people played the famous LOST numbers 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 in the Mega Millions on January 5th and each won $150. Also Weezer's lead singer Rivers Cuomo found his inspiration for the band's newest album after Hugo ""Hurley"" Reyes from LOST which they decided to name ""Hurley."" Cuomo stated that ""No words are on the cover because all we wanted was his amazing face."" I do agree that Hurley's face is amazing, and I nod approvingly at Cuomo for honoring his amazing face in such an epic way.",1301702400,,2860,4.803245436105477

And, even if you enjoy a good drama, this will be a great show for you.
On the matter of the box set itself, it's very well designed. All of the seasons are laid out well in their individual folding sleeves. The episode guide is very nice. And, the extra few prop replicas are fun to have as well.

Just most of the first season and I really have struggles to push myself to watch further. The story has so many bad nuances in it, that it makes me think what kind of a person wrote this. Was he delusional, does he know anything about life and society. At least half of all the decisions the main characters make do not make sense (that fact that they are lost and cut off the rest of the world does not justify them). Anyway, I can see that a lot of people like this show here and will probably disagree with me. But this is my honest opinion. If I decide to watch further and somehow the show will change my mind, I will follow up. The problem is I kind of have no interest to watch it anymore.",1300320000,,865,4.005780346820809

They needed to focus more on the mythology and giving answers and less time on squirrel Claire.  How they explained the whispers felt like a 6 year let down.

4076967,4,B0036EH3WU,"Lost was without doubt one of the great tv series of the last 20 years. The great shame is that a series which promised so much was unable to deliver a satisfying climax which the viewers craved. Nevertheless, although some viewers have let their disappointment at the ending colour their judgement of the entire series, I feel a bit more magnanimous and recognise that for the majority of its 6 seasons it kept me entertained and emotionally invested the way few other programmes did.
There is much to admire about Lost but for me its three greatest assets were;
1) The construct of the show: The flash-forward's/flash backwards/flash sideways constructs allowed the writers the freedom to explore the back-story of the characters. Obviously flashbacks are a fairly common device used in tv programmes, but Lost fully integrated them into the fabric of the show, cleverly using them to show some previously unknown aspect of a particular character or undermine a previously held belief of the viewers - generally these flashback complemented the on-island action adding a level of depth and pathos to the events which were occurring. They also cleverly intertwined the characters lives prior to the crash.
2) The acting: Not much needs to be said, for a show which contained such a large ensemble cast there are very few bad performances. Particular mention to who really steals most scenes that he is in.
3) The story: - This is the most important aspect of any piece of fiction - for the first couple of seasons Lost seemed to have more than enough plot to sustain 5 different programmes. Perhaps in some ways this led to the unsatisfying conclusion as the writers were unable to tie up all the questions they had raised. Still, it was a wild ride while it lasted and I can remember the excitement of tuning in every week just to see what was going to happen next.

No review of Lost is complete it would seem without mentioning the ending. For some reason American series seem to have a particular problem with delivering satisfying endings. The Sopranos and BSG suffered the same fate. In fact, of the small number of truly great programmes, only The Wire produced a conclusion that felt absolutely right. On reflection, my over-riding feeling is one of sadness; the writers had proven their capabilities over so much of the series so it certainly wasn't lack of ability which caused the ending to fall flat. I think in the end they opted for a safe option which they felt would please the most people - the irony is that they actually pleased very few. I suspect that given the chance they would do things differently. The ending does undermine some of the replay value of Lost - but it can't rob the series (as some reviewers have asserted) of its merits.
I suspect that when that in 10 or 20 years time, history will be a lot kinder to Lost and it will be looked back on as one of the great tv series of all time. It wasn't perfect, but its failings were as much to do with its ambitions to tell an epic story being so great. I personally will remember the series with a fondness I feel for few other programmes.",1300233600,,3120,4.641952983725136

4076969,3,B0036EH3WU,"Everyone has said everything that can be said about LOST. A great television series and that's that. I want to talk about the features of the Complete Collection.

Lost: The Complete Collection comes with an assortment of neat little collector items, albeit, not in very high quality. The Senet game pieces are ordinary rocks and plastic pieces. The Ankh doesn't look anything like what is pictured, although it pulls apart to reveal a secret message. The Blu-ray guide is very high quality. Judging from the image of the ""Island replica,"" one could expect the replica to have some degree of 3D contours of the Island's surface - it doesn't. A blacklight was included, but I haven't had a chance to investigate the contents of the Complete Collection with it just yet.

The case for the discs is larger than normal. It will stand out in your Blu-Ray collection. To some people, that doesn't matter - to others (like me) it does. The texture of the case is grainy and calls up the impression of limestone ruins. Each of the individual seasons pulls out of the case in a single sleeve. The discs are secured in a paper fold of the season sleeve, cut to fit each disc.

The disc rests on paper, with no plastic rings to elevate the disc and secure the read surface from damage.

LOST is a fantastic show. The three-star review does not reflect the quality of the show, rather, the quality of the product. The average-ness of extras such as the Senet game, the Ankh, or the black light are meh, and whatever, I can get over that. I bought The Complete Collection for the show. The discs for the show are stored in such a terrible and haphazard manner that it seems like too much thought went into designing a cool-looking box.

Over all, I'd say I'm content with my purchase, but I'm also pretty disappointed as well.",1299715200,3,2219,5.172701949860724
4076970,5,B0036EH3WU,"I watched Lost while it was aired first time. I am not fan to watch series, however, thank to my girlfriend four years ago(now my wife) I started to watch this TV show due to it was highly recommended. I have been hooked by the story since the very beginning to the very end. I can not still believe how good Lost is.

I really liked very much LOST that I bought this set on blu ray a few months ago. As soon as it arrived, I started watching it and I completed all six seasons till yestarday. This is my second time through, however, I was still amazed by every episodes as it were my first time through.

The quality of the pictures and sound of this blu ray set are outstanding. Full HD 1080p and DTS HD 5.1. And the box is very well done (hidden disc, darma initiative things, among others).

Now, I am a little sad because, there are not a great TV show out there that can replace LOST by now. I am trying Fringe, however, it was a great TV show, it is not as good as LOST for me.

I think I will wait a couple of months and I will start over from very beginner.

One of the thing a like most about this TV show was the soundtrack. It is the best soundtrack ever made for TV show so far.

I would like to thanks to all the people involved on producing this masterpeace. It was a very great experience to me watching this greastest TV show ever.",1299542400,6,1349,4.033707865168539
4076971,4,B0036EH3WU,"I never watched the series in prime time but recently completed watching via Netflix over a period of months.

I have mixed emotions about the series as a whole since I found it quite entertaining and engaging at times and a bit silly and hokey at other times.  I agree with some of the other reviews that the first few seasons were the best and it feels rushed in the last couple of seasons, as though they knew they were heading for a conclusion.

The best parts come when the Oceanic 815 survivors are debating and arguing about strategy and motives, many of those involving Locke, who I think was the most intriguing of all.  I had a soft spot for Hugo and Desmond, maybe because they were the most sincere and trustworthy.  Michael Emerson is terrifically evil as Ben and delivers the best one liners.

The story arc in Lost was a bit hard to follow at times with all of the time shifting and double dealing, but the use of the flashback, flash-forward, and the ""flash sideways"" were excellent ways to make me understand and care about the characters on the island.  It was sad when someone died because you had grown to like them, even with all of their faults.

I haven't seen the blu-ray addition, but imagine that it is quite good.  Lost is a show that lends itself to great bonus features (I got a kick out of the ""summary in 8:15"" segments).

The ""Dharma Initiative"" products that helped keep the survivors alive remind me of the old generic products that used to be on store shelves in the plain cans and boxes.  I keep thinking I'll run into one at Safeway or somewhere!",1299369600,,1583,4.442906574394463

4076983,4,B0036EH3WU,"My wife recently said that a woman entering a shopping mall is like a pilot entering the Bermuda Triangle.  She might come out eventually or perhaps stay there forever.  That's a premise for another enigma series.  For me, ""Lost"" was the most engaging TV series since ""The X-Files.""  Very much like ""The X-Files,"" the first series of ""Lost"" promised much more than it could ever deliver.  If ""Lost"" had lasted two seasons, what sort of end would the writers have provided us?  Startled by the success of the show, the writers weaved complex characters with a complex plot -- thereby keeping the island afloat for seven seasons.  The program is to be applauded for its addictive nature.  Surpassing all other soap operas, ""Lost"" pressed the viewer's imagination.  That the show fluctuated in style and focus from one season to the next is forgivable.  Consistency was not one of its major strengths.  From starting out as a kind of Irwin Allen-like catastrophe and survivability premise, the show eventually drifted into the supernatural.  This drift wasn't necessarily an improvement upon season one.  If I could subtract season seven, I'd give the show a full five stars.  However, the seventh season revealed the utter bankruptcy of the writers.  Perhaps from the start, no one had a clue how to end such a bold and fatiguing journey.  This is how it seems.  To resolve the unresolvable, the writers jumped the fence, offering a hollow, fatuously transcendent end to what started off as a mere adventure series.  The strange (forced?) interconnectedness of the characters created an additional layer of mystery (and unbelievability).  Ultimately, it was the characters and the actors who grew into portraying them is what drew us back to watch every episode.  This, far more than the often-times circumlocutious storyline, is what glued the audience to the series.  Any accolades must be left at the feet of the superb acting team who created a sense of realism out of a schlocky, banged-together story.",1298332800,4,2005,5.015151515151516

As for the show itself: everything from the season-specific menus to the crystal clear HD and 5.1 sound is exemplary.

4077025,3,B0036EH3WU,"This is not a review of LOST, but specifically of this collection of Blu-ray discs, the extras, and the packaging.  I have been waiting for the complete series of Lost on Blu-ray since Blu-ray won the great format war.  I was extremely excited when it was released in August, but waited until Black Friday to purchase it and am very happy to own this set.  I love the show and will get hundreds of hours of enjoyment watching it again.  That said, I have a couple complaints about this set.  First off, I do not like the packaging of this set at all.  The presentation of this set is really unique and attractive, but I don't want this huge (13"" x 11"") box sitting around in my TV room.  I would have thought that the internal box that holds the actual blu-ray discs would be more appropriately sized, and, while it is significantly smaller than the pyramid, at 10.5"" tall it is much bigger than a standard DVD box and won't fit on most DVD shelves.  The box that holds the individual sleeves  as well as the sleeves themselves are comparatively cheaply constructed as well (that is what I would prefer to be sturdy...)

My other complaint is with the included Senet ""game"".  I was misled into believing that an actual game was included-- i.e. something that I could play with friends.  However, the game is just a prop-- there are no instructions/rules.  Knowing Lost, perhaps the instructions are secretly hidden somewhere ""out there"" and left to the user to unearth.  (However, if that is the case, then they could have at least mentioned that somewhere in this set.  Since they did not, I doubt that is the case.).  The other tchotchkes provided in the set are nice if you like those type of things.  The episode guide is well done, but again over-sized.

I do like the extra digital content on the discs themselves.  Lost was a fantastic journey and, as a fan, getting insight into the making of the series is very enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the mini documentary regarding the final episode, and watching Jorge Garcia read the script and seeing his reaction.  The other extras are mostly enjoyable as well, including the ""never before seen footage"" which put a nice cherry on the series (although, I can understand why it wasn't aired-- it would have totally changed the emotional ending to the finale).",1295136000,9,2314,4.636363636363637

I live in the Netherlands, and sadly this complete collection (with all the extras) was only available in the USA and is region A encoded. So if you live outside of the US and want this box, be sure to have a region-free blu-ray player!",1294963200,,655,4.7043478260869565

But that's not what someone looking at this set is interested in.  If you're looking at this set you already know the show is the greatest in the history of TV.

I know that the Blu-Ray discs are much more scratch resistant than DVD's, they came in cardboard sleeves that slide into slit-like pockets.  Each season has its own sleeve (quad-fold), available for two per section.  The seasons are all packaged in a separate single cardboard sleeve for putting separately on your shelf.  Mine arrived packaged in a single box with Styrofoam to protect it during shipping and arrived undamaged.  Everything comes packaged inside the pyramid, with a guide to every episode in the series.  The one small issue that I had with this collection was the cardboard slits for the discs, maybe could have used hard plastic with center clips like most other collections.  But, this did not stop me from purchasing, I am just a little bit more careful removing them.

I bought it the day after Thanksgiving for a great price and I am glad that I did.  No regrets about this purchase.

4077093,5,B0036EH3WU,"I will make only one comment on the show, as this review is for the product, not the show itself. Ever wonder how many times in this show that people resort to hitting somebody? I know that Sawyer pointed out that it's Lord of the Flies on the Island, but still. Somebody annoys you, does something you don't like, won't do something you want? Just hit them. Anyway, onto the review of the Blu-Ray. So far, I've watched the first 3 seasons. I will update the review when I've watched everything.

Starting from when you first load a Blu-Ray: very long load times! I have a quick loading player, and it still takes forever. There is so much crap to go through before the menu pops up. Also, the first disc of every season has a bunch of promo previews, mostly for other Lost DVD's. Very annoying. Most collections only do that on the first DVD, not the first DVD of every season.

Phenomenal picture and sound quality from the HD Master Audio, tho there isn't much of a LFE(low-frequency effect or subwoofer) channel. There are cool menu backgrounds, typically of a figure in an Island scene.

There is no Play All episodes option on season 1&2, but there is on 3. Pressing stop wipes out where you were. My OPPO BDP83 has a memory system, wherein even if I turn off the player, and remove the disc, it remembers where I was when I put the disc back in. Not this DVD. That positively necessitates using Season Play, which is great. Season Play functions like a Play All option. You can select a pre-set profile, mine is Man of Faith. This will remember your spot if you press stop, turn off the player, or remove the disc. It will also remind you if you forget what disc you were on. Very cool. What's annoying is, if you change discs, without turning the player off, it will start the next episode automatically. However, if you turn off the player, you will still have to wait for all the promos, and other crap, before the menu pops up when turning it back on. Once it does finally get to the menu, you have to select Season Play, and it will(finally) take you to where you left off.

This is probably the coolest packaging I've ever seen. There are so many things printed on the box etc. Plus, the included blacklight can be used on the packaging to reveal the hand-drawn map of the hatches that were seen on the blast door inside the Swan station. The Ankh has a message from Jacob, which is basically a set of instructions for using your remote to unlock the easter egg of how to play the included Senet game that Jacob and Smoky play in the show. There is a Black Rock journal entry that reveals the answer to a minor question, that it was the BR that Jacob and Smoky were discussing on the beach as they looked at it on the water, and a couple other small revelations about the BR's journey.

Special features are awesome. Each season has similar things. They include Flashbacks, On Location, Deleted Scenes, Audition Tapes, Making of, Anatomy of a scene,bloopers, etc.

Season 2 is awesome. The menu is set up like a Dharma Orientation film, featuring our favorite scientist. Special features include a 6 Degrees of Separation type of Lost Connections, showing how the characters are related. I had no idea that one of Sawyers ""cons"" was the TV woman Hurley was watching when she announced his winning lottery numbers. There's a World According to Sawyer featurette, deleted scenes etc.

There are hours of extras in this collection, including something I almost didn't find until I read about it. That would be the hidden dvd in the packaging! The videos telling where it's located are gone due to copyright, but I will tell you here. Spoiler alert! I tried finding it by gently tugging the box, searching thru all the various pieces. Finally, I realized that the box top, w/a representation of the Island on the back, can be turned. It's set up as a ""lock and key"" type deal. Rotate the Island 90 degrees to ""unlock"" it. Pull it off. There's a flap, and under the flap, there's the dvd! Sweet!

While there are some definite annoyances, mainly the long load times, even when using Season Play, this is by far the coolest, most comprehensive box set I've ever seen. With clues to be found within the DVD's, and even within the packaging itself, this is a must for Lost fans.",1292457600,,4283,4.510309278350515

Lost is a compilation of many interacting story lines and continually keeps you on the edge of your seat. To fully respect and understand the phenomena that is Lost I truly reccomend this collection. You will not regret the decision as once you get UN-Lost (if thats possible still have to watch season 6), you will admire the wonderful package this collection comes in and all the accessories that will bring the sole of Lost into your home.

It arrived in great shape; packaged in two boxes, with cushion in between. Everything that was said to be included, was. The collection has so much to offer, it's difficult to figure out where to start! I think my favorite extra is the board game and playing pieces that come with it; I can't wait to play! The hidden disk was very cool to find. This is a great buy for anyone who is a fan of the television series, Lost.

The only problem I had with my purchase was the wait; I selected the 2 day shipping and it took a fews days before it even shipped. This is my first purchase from this site, so this may just be the norm. Either way, it was worth the wait!",1291161600,2,775,4.065359477124183

I love the show and would give you a 5 star rating on the show but this is a review about the product, not the show. The set gets 4 stars for a few reasons. The good is that it has every season, plus bonus content, a secret disc, and some cool little toys. The set looks nice and I got it for a great price with my Amazon discount. I had some issues playing the final episode on my xbox and returned it for a new set with no problems. I also noticed that the battery for the blacklight flashlight was dead on the replacement set. The bad would be the individual season cases. I like when you can click in the dvd so it doesn't move. This is simply thin cardboard with sleeves cut into them. You just slip in the disc which I don't like. It can scratch up the dvds a little and some dvds seemed kinda stuck to the cardboard. The designs on each season were ugly too. The designs on the discs itself seem to be the same from the individual season sets but please correct me if I'm wrong. The menus all seem to be the same from the previous season releases. I did like the last names on all the covers. Overall i'm very happy with my purchase. In regards to the people giving reviews on the show itself, please try to review the actual product and not if you liked it or not...use tv.com for that. I also have seen all the episodes at least twice, loved the finale, and introduced 2 people to the show who love it already.(one of whom has seen all episodes/one who is on season 3)",1291161600,6,1544,4.065573770491803

4077123,5,B0036EH3WU,"Lost was a show that divided the way TV would make shows from then on. This series, in spite of many saying otherwise, only had a few bumps along the way, nothing that compromised their structure and narrative.
With this colection the viewers can perceive with more clarity, the themes of each season, and how this show kept audience glued to the screen.
The box is amazing and filled with secrets. I only missed the instructions on how to play the game that came with the box, but I think there's a lot more to discover about it yet.

4077125,3,B0036EH3WU,"I never watched the series while it was on television, but got hooked on Lost when I saw an episode from one of the DVDs at a friends house.  When I heard about the complete series being released and in a huge boxset, I just had to pick it up.  Now the series is great.  Action, Mystery, Drama, even some humour all wrapped up in a neat 45 minutes.  now these boxsets I'm learning, although cheaper, can sometimes come back to bite you in the butt.  I have been watching an average of 3 - 4 episodes a day, with breaks from the series every now and then, so its taking me some time to complete.  All the discs from season 1 to 3 have worked, but sometimes have glitched for unknown reasons.  I ignored these because they were very small and not worth the hassle of driving back to the store.  Moving onto season 4, I was very disappointed to find that discs 2 and 3 didn't want to work at all.  Now if I wanted to return it, I would probably have to return the whole set, if they even would take it back, and then have to watch all of seasons 1 to 3 again.  Not impressed with the way the discs are stored, in the slip sleeves.  If there is any dirt in the case, sliding the discs in and out can probably scratch them.  I personally like cases that have the center piece holding the disc in place.  My lesson learned from this is unless they offer a very collectible giftbox, I am going to avoid multiple season boxsets.",1290211200,13,1420,4.138686131386861

4077127,5,B0036EH3WU,"Back in 2004, I saw a commercial for an upcoming show called ""Lost"" and I thought that there wasn't any way that a show that was just about survivors of a plane crash on an island with a monster would last. Admittedly, I expected a poorly executed piece of television.

But after watching five seasons of the show, I was hooked. And then the final season aired and I was angry. I honestly felt like the show had focused more on character resolution and had barely addressed how its complex mythology fit together.

So I bought this collection and I watched the entire series again, just to see the show in its entirety to see if I could make sense of what the show was intended to be. And after watching 6 seasons all over again, I changed my mind.

I'm not going to say patronizing things about how Lost is so much better than any show and that it's only for intelligent-minded people or that it's only for open-minded people. What I'll say is this:

Lost is a truly unique television show to watch. It's imaginative, surprising, affecting, emotionally-touching, audacious,and it has some of the best characters you'll find. And, yes, it has plenty of mysteries (and also plenty of answers along the way), but in the end, Lost stays true to itself: great characters, compelling stories, but just enough mystery to keep you watching.

I've watched the series a lot since it ended, and every time I watch it, it still has the same sense of surprise and mystery and emotion as it did when I saw it the first time around. And though that might be frustrating to some (and if you feel that way, you're certainly entitled to), I'm glad that Lost never had that part of itself taken away and that it will always retain the characteristics that made me enjoy it.

As for the packaging, it's great! Includes some surprises, some cool collector's items (read the Black Rock diary--you may find a long-awaited answer), and it looks well put together with lots of details that hearken back to moments in the series. The DVD case is a little flimsy and a couple of the episodes in Season 6 have very minor frame jumps (only like in 1 or 2 spots in the whole series), but if you enjoyed Lost the first time around, it's worth buying in my opinion.

Bottom line: Lost is a truly unique experience, one that I'd recommend without hesitation.",1290038400,370,2326,4.536992840095466
4077128,5,B0036EH3WU,"My wife and I came to LOST only after the 6 seasons had already aired. I had assumed for years that it would be a long Survivor episode - only fake. I was wrong. It is certainly one of the best television series ever. You care about the characters and believe everything that happens because they believe it. The series stumbles in the 4th season, but the characters also stumble. A few characters can be annoying and whiny, but most of those get what they deserve sooner than later. Over 6 seasons long term characters actually develop and learn life lessons. The imagination level is a ten out of ten. We actually bought the complete series because after watching the whole shebang on Netflix, we wanted to watch it all over again. I own very few DVDS. I only buy things worth rewatching more than twice - The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, A History Of Violence, Memento, Stop Making Sense, ... LOST is such a thing.",1289952000,5,913,4.506024096385542
4077129,3,B0036EH3WU,"One corner of the box was already ripped before I first opened it. The part you take apart to get to the secret disc won't go back together because the cardboard is now frayed. Several discs refuse to play on my blu-ray player for some reason; all others are fine.

All in all, it's still a great box of goodies for an avid Lost fan. There are too many goodies not to get it, but the workmanship is not the greatest I've seen and the fact that several of the discs don't even work makes it a bit useless.",1289952000,2,504,4.090909090909091
4077130,5,B0036EH3WU,"Everyone knows what the show is about. A plane crashes on a strange island. Over 40 survivors, who struggle to stay alive and understand the mysterious events occurring. Is it an accident that they survived and met, or is it fate? Who are the strange Others who were there first? What is the Monster lurking in the jungle? As the series progressed through 6 seasons, many plots were resolved, but others were left open to interpretation or bogged down in inconsistencies. The producers admit they prioritized the character over plot resolution.  The scenery is gorgeous, the soundtrack is amazing. The acting is mostly of a high standard. The final season was a bit of a mess, so I'd give it 8.5/10 because of that.

I chose to buy the USA set as opposed to the UK set because it just looks so much better. The UK set is just individual seasons stuck together. This set is a work of art. The outer box looks like a memorial to the plane crash victims. Within is the main box, which is textured to feel like the Egyptian stone it looks like. Within the dvds are in lovely card wallets, and there are several extra goodies to find. Each season has lots of extra documentaries and comments from directors and actors. Set is 9.5/10. Not 10/10 because it is a bit big and awkward to open and handle.",1289865600,2,1294,4.502127659574468

The quality of the picture on blu-ray is, for the most part, superb, however there are a few rare low light shots that look a bit fuzzy.

Myonly real complaints are that the rules for the Senet game are hidden on a hidden menu in a hidden disk hidden in a hidden compartment in the box (which might, itself be hidden as well, if your into that) and aren't provided in writing inside the box, and that some of the discs contain 5 episodes each despite the accompanying booklet listing all disks as containing four episodes.",1289433600,4,632,4.633928571428571

That said I was absolutely amazed by the quality of the product and the experience of the collectors set. The goodies inside are a bonus but what really amazed me was the experience the makers put into the Blu-rays. Lost was all about finding hidden things and secret information, the Blu-rays Don't disappoint on this aspect. The menus offer the ability (with a little button pushing) to find several hidden gems of behind the scenes views and featuretts that you have to discover for yourself. Not only do the blu-rays have hidden items but the box itself has hidden inside of it some information and extra features that I do not want to spoil for the other lost fans but i will give a hint, use the included UV Led pen and shine it on everything that came with the set. I must say that while the price is a little higher than I thought reasonable before I purchased it I can certainly say that I am surprised that they aren't charging more. It is definately worth more than I paid for it but I am so glad that I got it. I did get 2 sets of throwing sticks instead of 1 bag white rocks but thats ok as I am not going to play with the game that came with it.

My only complaint is the storage.  Don't get me wrong, the box has a great design and looks excellent on it's own, but it is very awkward and difficult to store.  I don't know why studios insist on doing this with complete collections of TV series.  I was hoping that the box that contained the discs would be standard DVD size so that I could put it on my shelf and display the larger box elsewhere, but sadly this is not case.  I am one of those obsessive compulsive people that take displayability into account when purchasing DVDs and this set just does not look at home with all my other DVDs.

Instead of a wonderful experience, we were were subjected to the outrage of an unskippable commercial for...LOST--The Blu Ray edition.  What kind of IDIOT would force somebody who just paid $200 for the full box set to sit through spoiler after spoiler after spoiler of a series whose whole point is mystery and revelation?  Moreover, what kind of IDIOT would crank up the volume on that promotion to full-on USED CAR SALESMAN SCREAMING?  The ad volume was louder than the airplane explosion, for heaven's sake!  And with a program volume that was totally reasonable for late-night viewing, the stupid ad was so loud that it woke up our child (which meant we had to wait even longer to try out this new purchase).

Yes, the quality of Blu Ray is amazing.  Yes the production values of the series itself are fantastic.  But if anybody in Hollywood is reading this: please think of your audience first.  Everything about the first five minutes of the first DVD was wrong, and for that I deduct two stars, because every time I think about this product I think about my disbelief, disappointment, and the extraordinary inconvenience of compensating for the IDIOCY of those responsible for the final authoring of this disc.",1286841600,4,2062,5.383177570093458

I, unlike alot of people, was massivly moved and happy with how the show finished. There were many things that didn't get explained and no-point storys.
But the show was always about the fellings and emotions of the characters, it was just dressed up with a great mystery theme.

this box-set is without doubt the best on the market!
if your from the uk, woundering if you should buy this.........
just ask, are you happy with second best?

in all fields this set champions above any set avalible in the uk. obviously they both have the same disks, but this packaging is special, with many cool things to find!!",1286841600,,729,4.557251908396947

Having seen an image of the UK version I decided to buy from Amazon.com, it took about 3 weeks to arrive but was well worth the wait. It actually works out cheaper than the UK version and you also get the black light to read hidden messages on the lid.

SPOILER: The hidden disk under the lid is fantastic however getting the island back into place was very difficult which is a very small design floor considering how well the whole package has been put together.

UK buyers, I seriously recommend you getting you hands on this version of the Box set.

I can also confirm it works fine in my PS3 Slim.",1286755200,2,728,4.223021582733813

What I will delve into is the quality of the packaging, the presentation, and the excellent blu-ray picture and audio quality. The packaging was solid, looks great on top of my media shelf, and appears that it will be able to withstand the test of time. The presentation is excellent, and while I prefer plastic blu-ray shells; It would be quite a huge space taker if these discs were not stored in booklet style packaging. In the end, it doesn't matter if you keep it stored in the box, as they fit perfectly within the box without too much trouble in getting them out. Lastly, the picture and audio are some of the best in my blu-ray collection. I am simply amazed at the mastering done to bring these over to blu-ray. Audio is spot on, and Video is far better than any other series blu-rays that I have personally owned or seen on blu-ray to date.",1286496000,2,1090,4.396039603960396
4077219,5,B0036EH3WU,"Honestly, I am not a rewatcher by nature. Don't reread even books I've loved, either. But with Lost, there is just something magical about it that it gets more compelling with each rewatch. It has to do with the timelessness of themes, the complexity of the characters, the writing, acting, directing, music, location -- I am just so happy with this boxed collection. Love the extras and the clever way they are hidden.
  Now the nitpick: while it's nice to have a booklet that outlines the episodes, I wish the episode numbers and corresponding names had been printed smack dab on the disks.  If even the disk cover (each season gets a cardboard trifold of disks) would list these it would be much more convenient than having to go find that booklet every time.
  Small matter, really. All told I really love Lost and am grateful to have these disks.",1286409600,,851,4.6466666666666665

Then, I found the wonderfully hidden disc, which has some of the documentaries I bought this package for, and then I discovered I CAN'T SEE IT!!!!!

I don't mind waiting to see the whole series again, but WHAT THE HELL???? WHY DID THEY PROTECT THAT DISC??????I'm so pissed out I don't think I ever buy in amazon again. $194 and I can't see the best material because nobody took the detail of saying the disc was region encoded.

Thanks a lot, buenavista. Your region protection policy SUCKS.

By the way, the complete collection in Spain has a lot of differences with the USA version, that's why I bought the american one.

Having literally everything in one box (pretty cool one at that) really makes it convenient to get 'lost' in one of tv's greatest dramas.  I am a proud owner of this series as I think it sticks out as a unique achievement in TV, it has the production value of a Hollywood feature, it just takes about 3 months of nightly watching to get through the twists, turns and mind-grenades!

4077270,5,B0036EH3WU,"If you are just now looking into watching the TV Series LOST for the first time, I might suggest you NOT purchase this. Unless, of course, you are a Bluray fanatic and you purchase television programs at random. This show is one of the few to be so successful when each episode built off of the previous episodes in the series. It was not a show that could simply be picked up at random spots and understood. Show like, THE BIG BANG THEORY, while good, can be generally watched at any point in the series and past events either don't matter, or are blatantly obvious so that the audience is never lost to the episodes storyline. With this down, I encourage new-comers to LOST to rent/netflix the first couple discs of season 1 and determine if you like the show. Things change drastically through season two and three in a very sci-fi way, but I found it to be incredibly enjoyable. Once you know you love LOST, this purchase will be worth your while.

LOST feels at home in the 1080p glory of bluray with the lush tropic island environments (filmed in Hawaii I believe) and the characters feeling that much closer to your heart. If you are a long time LOST fan you should do yourself a favor, and go bluray. It looks, sounds, and feels better than the DVD so don't skimp on the cash difference between the formats. I mean seriously, its LOST, that in itself should be enough for you to purchase it if you always loved the series. Some people freaked out about Season 6 not going the way THEY wanted it to go. Oh well to them I suppose, they just spent 6 seasons of their life just to be peeved off.

Quick Summary:
New to LOST? ----> Rent/Netflix and determine if you like it, then buy Bluray if you do.

Longtime LOST fan? ----> Don't skimp, go Bluray so you know you got the best quality product and experience on such an awesome show. Seriously, IT'S LOST!

Easily peeved off when endings don't go the way you had planned them out to go? ----> Stop after Season 5, or watch all of it and don't whine online after Season 6.

Other Thoughts:
The extended series finale was a welcome addition. The goodies in the box were charming and really added to the nostalgic sense of the show I had loved so much... Shame they're so worthless in the end that I won't care if the dog gets ahold of them.. Then again, isn't that the feeling you get 99.8% of the time when you get goodies in some electronic purchase (game or movie/show)?

Five Stars from me, buy wisely friends.",1285372800,2,2467,4.387308533916849

The enclosed items in the box are great (except I want to know how to play the game). I liked the way the collector's box looked like an old relic from the island. The construction of the box is very good and seems like it will hold up very well. I would suggest to anyone that is in the Darma Initiative or one of the Others, or on Oceanic Flight 518 to order this collection you will watch it again and again.

What I liked for the most part was the character development, most of the backstories and at least the setup for various intrigues.  Unfortunately this was NOT a character driven series.  What I did not like was the failure to satisfactorily close MANY tracts and issues.  For the number of viewers invested in this show a lot more care should've been taken, but instead the viewer was exploited with the pretense of something that was never to be.  On the whole most seasons were at least ""Good"", and a few fantastic. However one thing is for certain... Season 6 is a burning mess of confusion and bad writing.  It's a shame because it was an opportunity for the writers to create closure for much of what had happened.  ""Come with me"" is used at least two to three times an episode in Season 6. Endless, pointless excursions ep after ep, back/forth and back/forth across the island usually for no worthwhile reason... characters switching loyalties countless times and for no worthwhile reason.  So many in fact that I lost track and almost lost interest completely.  When you look at season 6, other than the flash sideways scenes, most of the island scenes were basically worthless.

I had to go online and find out which episodes had commentaries and manually select the audio track. Also, the booklet that lists the episodes doesn't mention what special features are on which disk.

First let me say that the packaging is very impressive and I've never seen a collection packaged like this.  Fans of the show will find a great deal of nostalgia with what's given here, and new-comers to the series will really feel like they've gotten their moneys worth.

For those who are still unsure if this series is for them, let me give you a little tip.  Put aside the fact that there will be many characters on this show that seem very one dimensional, and will have the same extact conflicts on every episode.  I could list the names of character I don't particularly like, but I'll leave that to you, but remember that the journey isn't just about them, it's more about the island, and figuring out what's really going on there.

the product its self comes in a very large very exciting box with gifts and games. the actual seasons look like tall books of religious scripture that come in a stone like tablet. the box is a cardboard box with layers of texture to make the sets appearance look as if it came from a temple. Opening the box was like Christmas for me. I was a dedicated follower of the show since the beginning and waiting to buy the box set season on blu ray was the best decision i have ever made.

I knew I was going to love the box set even it it literally came in a a cardboard box.  Luckily, it did not. The packaging on this set is so fantastic, and the attention to detail is very much in tune with the show. Spoiler alert, there's a hidden disc. The bonus features are aplenty. I have been spacing out the 30 extra hours to make it last a little bit longer, but they are definitely great. The Easter eggs are also truly fun. If there are any Michael Giacchino fans reading this, be on the lookout for a Giacchino-y egg, of sorts. The epilogue is exactly what an epilogue is supposed to be. It has the same feel of the show while gently touching upon areas from the series. I was definitely worried that it would try to spell things out or touch upon themes that were ended so beautifully, but they did a fantastic job!

The Oceanic logo that appears as the Blu-Ray discs are loading is also very fun.",1284336000,2,1046,4.225

4077319,5,B0036EH3WU,"I have waited for this since the end of the show. This collection comes with extra materal that relates to different seasons. The first thing you will notice is that there is a lot of packaging to get through. The disks are packaged in a way that prevents sratching. This is certainlly better than a previous serious collection I ordered of Stargate Atlantis.

I do recommend this if you are a fan of Lost. Also if you want to catch up on episodes that you missed, this is great for that and with a all the extra bonus material.",1283817600,3,528,4.333333333333333

It would've been a lot nicer if I didn't have the previous seasons. I loved the show, so I'm not gonna comment on the story of Lost.  About the contents: The letter was a cool thing to read. The ankh couldn't been molded better, its an imperfect cross, but oh well. Jacob's message was a bunch a symbols (they say its a message to help you find the hidden disc) .  Black light was a cool thing to have. Use it on the map and on a black cardboard paper under the seasons box. It has alot of hidden messages too which are revealed with black light. It shows the diagram shown in Season 2 when Locke's is trapped on the security door and they fail to push the button and the lights go out revealing diagram and other messages. The map doesn't have the locations written, and it was confusing not to see 2 islands. The Exclusive episode guide has a small description for every episode and pictures of importance scenes of the series. The Senet game is also nice, its a thick cardboard with the symbols not like the series where it was a wooden box. (I didn't expect them to make an exact replica of the game in the series). The next day of me receiving the collection, I saw on a site that there is a hidden bluray disc, I couldn't believe it but then again, I didn't read carefully that it wasn't 35 discs, its 36. That disc had the smoke monster effects on the main menu and sub menus which was cool. I don't wanna be the guy who spoiled the whereabouts of the hidden disk so if you cant find it, google it.

4077323,5,B0036EH3WU,"LOST has to be one of my all time favorite television shows. So much so that even though I live in New Zealand I had to order this magnificent collectors set.

Now season 3 & season 4 are region coded but all the other seasons (1,2,5 and 6) are region free. The bonus disc that is only available with this set is region free as well!

Without giving to much away I have viewed the bonus disc and it has some very interesting interviews with the cast (after the show had finished) along with a feature with Michael Giacchino composing the final episode. It also features some behind the scenes features and deleted scenes that were missed off previous seasons.

The design of the actual set is very nice. One of the most surprising things is that they have added textures over the set to make it feel like rock/stone.

I would recommend this set to any huge LOST fan even if you do have to buy season 3 and 4 separately. In New Zealand it still works out cheaper than buying all of the seasons separately on Blu-ray and what's also great is that season 6 doesn't even come out over here until October :-D",1283558400,3,1103,4.339805825242719

I will say that I just received this box set and it's one of THE BEST packages out there! The packaging/presentation is impressively excellent (although some might say it's bulky)! And as for the picture on blu-ray: I always tell friends when it comes to blu-ray that Disney/Buena Vista ALWAYS leads the way in terms of picture quality! Disney nevers fails to impress in both their picture quality and sound quality, and it's good to see that they've kept up their tradition with ""Lost."" You can't go wrong. And, now, with the release of ""Lost,"" fans are able to relive one of the best series, plus see the famous 12-minute ""epilogue episode"" featuring the two castaways on how they ran the Island.

""Lost"" was a groundbreaking show that was one of the best dramas I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot). The technical aspects (especially SeasonPlay, which bookmarks wherever you stop watching; even if you put in different DVDs, when you pop in the disc you were watching, the scene picks up where you left off!) are all top-notch and the extras -- both on the DVDs and the physical pieces (like the game and ankh) -- as well as the packaging itself, are all great collector's items that make this box set well worth the money!

This is an amazing complete collection of the entire series.  I was on the fence about buying it for a while, not really wanting to spend the $200 for something that I have already seen.  But then I thought that it's only a little over $5 per blu-ray disc and that's not bad at all.  And now that I have it I am very happy with my purchase.  Actually for me to buy the complete series like this made a lot of sense.  I didn't become a fan of the show until the final season.  I caught up by watching the first 5 seasons on Hulu.  Needless to say, the Blu-Ray discs are a major improvement (plus I get all the bonus material).  Stunningly beautiful, especially for a TV show.  Being set in the lush, tropical location of Hawaii certainly helps there.  One drawback though is that some of the darker scenes tend to be a little grainy.  I turned the brightness level down on my TV and that seemed to help.  I am now in the process of rewatching the entire series.  I have to say that things make a lot more sense the second time around.  I really can't get enough of this show.  It is intelligent, thought provoking, beautiful, and emotional.  The episodes just seem to fly by.  There's never a time where I even think about pushing the fast-forward button.  LOST ranks up there as one of, if not the, best television show of all time.

That takes care of the blu-ray discs and the show itself.  As for the packaging, I give it an A+ as well.  All of the materials are of high quality.  It comes in the pyramid shaped box that you see in the picture.  The picture there really doesn't do it justice though.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is made of a thick cardboard and is coated with a rough, stone-like texture.  And it has a good feel and weight to it.  There are many cool little extras inside the box as well, from the Senet game that comes with real black and white stones to the small metal Dharma flash(black)light.  Then there are many ""secrets"" hidden in the packaging.  I found a few of them, but I am still looking for the instructions to the Senet game.  All in all a very well put together product.  You can see that the developers really put some time and thought into designing it.",1283299200,4,2400,4.618483412322274
4077329,4,B0036EH3WU,"If you've been holding off getting the DVDs until the show ended then you might as well get this set cause at roughly $25 a season  at Amzaon's current price ($148.99) it's a pretty decent deal.
But if you already have the DVDs and aren't a huge fan of the show then you might want to reconsider. Much like the ""Season 5 Dharma Orientation Kit"" there isn't much here that isn't going to excite anyone but the ultimate fan. Luckily for me, I happen to be one.
I was a little disappointed in the ""secret message from Jacob"" that was in the Ankh at first, but it turned out to be a fun puzzle to solve that revealed some interesting information (not answers). I also loved finding the bonus disc (it is same disc that came with the season 6 pre-order from BEST BUY) because of the way it was hidden. The Black Rock journal entry answered a question that was well worth the trouble deciphering the handwriting and the black light torch shows some cool hidden secrets. I'll never play the Senet game but it's still a cool prop to have (you'll have to do some hunting for the instructions on how to play).
Still, all I've listed as features I enjoy will just frustrate most casual viewers who were hoping for MORE(or all of the)answers to unanswered questions. I like it, it's a cool set, and if your a fan who loved the series from ""Pilot"" to ""The End"" then you probably will too. Anyone else, should probably just pass on it.",1283299200,2,1421,4.382575757575758

4077331,4,B0036EH3WU,"I am confining my review to the Lost Complete Seasons 1-6 Blu-ray set.  I'll leave comments regarding season six and the ending to others.  Those are matters of personal likes and dislike.

The biggest positive is that the blu-ray discs were well done, although I haven't had time to watch them all, as of yet.  Nor have I had time to view the extras.  The Senet game looks interesting.  The white and black rocks are a nice touch, and the ankh isn't as bad as another review stated.  The appearance and texture of the set is quite nice and you can tell a lot of thought went into it.

That brings me to the biggest negative.  The way the discs are packed is the worst I've seen since getting the complete West Wing set.  These discs are far too valuable to be packaged in slide-in cardboard sleeves.  What were they thinking?  Having spent almost $200 on this set, I now have to spend another $25 for proper plastic cases.  The one aspect of this set reduced my rating from 5 to 4 stars.",1283212800,6,988,4.333333333333333

I was a little disappointed with the season 5 Dharma set but this set really makes up for it.  I especially liked finding the bonus disk on my own without help from the internet.

4077344,5,B0036EH3WU,"I received my copy of the blu ray complete set a couple of days ago. It came packaged in a very nice outerbox (someone already posted a picture of this already) and the entire set really has a lot of nice heft to it. I particularly liked all the raised texture you can feel all over the box, which is constructed with really high-quality paper. Opening it, on the underside of the lid is an overview map of the island, but locations aren't marked on it ... just as you might see it in the air or something.

Yes, I am giving this entire set five stars. I have invested lots of my time invested in the series over several years watching it, participating in online forums and listening to several podcasts. We talked about the series amongst ourselves at great length at work. I like this series because it was interesting, added a bit of mystery and suspense, action and some fun thrills. I am certainly not going to get into a great debate over the series finale or how disappointed one would be without every single question answered.

If you had questions after the finale ended, well good thing this box set came out, because several things were answered in it. You get some clues in the ""New Man in Charge"" on the season 6 features, and you get some others on the box set's exclusive disc that is hidden within the packaging. I spent my entire weekend watching that disc, and I appreciate the series even more now than I did in May when the last episode aired.

This whole box set is a real labor of love from the folks at Lost and ABC. They produced a quality product with SO many extras (I never laughed so hard after watching those Lost Slap Downs on the extras discs) plus hours and hours of official Lost podcasts.

The only thing I couldn't find easily were directions for the Senet game. My husband had to look that up for directions. However we spent several hours yesterday playing the game together and having a good time. He and I plan on doing an entire series rewatch soon. He rarely watches television with me since our tastes differ. I think this set again is worth the five stars because we get to spend lots of time together enjoying it.

I don't see myself playing with the game any time soon but I think the blue light is cool.  I am going to start my marathon this weekend.  I have already watched all the new features on the final disc.
As a LOST fan who didn't want it to end, but enjoyed it all, I was looking forward to this complete set for a while, with the bonus features.  I was only disappointed in the bonus 'episode': The New Man in Charge.  I was expecting it to be a bit longer and more informative; I liked what they gave us in it, but wish there was more.
Overall though, no true lost fan will be disappointed in buying this!",1283126400,4,846,4.121951219512195
4077346,5,B0036EH3WU,"I received my Lost gift set yesterday.  Its a very lovely gift from the creators of Lost.  As you've heard, it comes with a Senet board and game pieces, ankh that contains hints on how to get to an easter egg on the bonus disc, a diary page from the black rock and the black light (which helps you see the hatch map on the bottom of the box as well as reveal the hints to find the extra disc).  The replica of the temple is very sturdy...and you can actually turn the lid upside-down so that the map is on top if thats your preference.

What a lot of reviews fail to mention is that it's loaded with a heaping dose of nostalgia.

The box that the set comes wrapped in is actually a memorial of all the characters that appeared on the show.  The episode guide has some very lovely illustrations in it, depicting what I would consider the most memorable scenes of the show.  The sleeves that the discs come in also have some of the same type of artwork.  I actually got a lump in my throat as I was flipping through these things remembering the first time we watched those scenes...remembering the people I'd discuss the episodes with and realizing we won't have any of that this year except for the mass re-watch that many of us will be participating in.

Then there are the special features.  Swan Song shows everyone in Michael Giacchino's studio watching them record the soundtrack for the finale.  Carlton Cuse was literally fighting back tears and you could tell this was a very sad moment for everyone in the room.  It's at this point, a true Lost fan will probably be reaching for the kleenex as well.

The bonus disc which is hidden in the set, has a feature called Letting Go which is basically several cast members revisiting locations and talking about what it's going to be like for this family of actors to be disbanding after working together for six years.  It's a very emotional feature and makes me realize just how long six years really is...but how quickly it all went by.

This is a review of the actual package, not the TV series itself, which is excellent.

The package comes in a large box, about the size of a mid-sized board game.  inside well packed is a large brick that is the collection.  The materials are of high quality, this is not a cheap plastic and cardboard, it is high quality plastic/ceramic for the most part, and the series and the extras are nicely packaged to fit into the box.

The box itself is very sturdy, and well made, it will protect your collection from all but the hardest knocks.  The map, which also serves as the top cover is also of high quality production and sturdiness, The senet board is also well made, on par with a high quality chess or checker board that you can get at a hobby store, not made of cheep cardboard. The Episode guide is competent, on par for what you expect, paragraph long summaries of episodes overlaid on images from the series.

I have not opened the black light, but it appears to be of the same build quality as of the ""Keychain Maglights"" you can find.  It has a nice Dharma touch to it.  The ankh is solid, and no flimsy, and the senet pecies are actual rock, and not the cheep plastic bits I was expecting.  The smaller pieces of the collection are in little carboard pockets that are beside the actual disks.

The packaging of the disks is decent cardboard, which has some advantages and disadvantages over the typical plastic packaging. They are very easy to take out and put back in, and no worry about breaking the plastic or scratching a disk after watching it.  It is not as durable as Plastic, so you have to be careful not to bend the edges of the sleeves when you put a season in or out.  Each season has its own sleeve.

Blu-Ray Quality

The high definition is of high quality, I have only watched the first disk so far of season one, however it appears that they did a professional job making the disks, and didn't see any major errors in the sound or video quality.  Lost is a lush and wonderfully shot and sounded series, very much near movie quality, and the Blu-Ray really shows this off from the greens if the island, the sounds of the smoke monster, to the wonderfully skilled actors and actresses who make up this ensemble cast.

Not only does it contain a great series (I will let others review the series in general, but Season 1 and 2 are excellent, season 3 is a mix of some of the rare poor episodes to some of the best, and four and five step up the quality.  I have not watched Season six.

This is a great gift or purchase for someone who does not have the series, not only is the series good, but the add-ons and trinkets are very nice.  Also it saves money from buying the seasons on a individual basis.

The only bad thing about the package is that the sleeves corners may get bent after pulling them in and out of the packaging as you watch though the series.",1282867200,8,2982,4.289285714285715
4077349,5,B0036EH3WU,"I love the packaging for the series and am happy that this isn't a limited or special edition pack. This set is for true Lost fans, it comes with a little light that you can shine on a few things in the package and hidden symbols appear.
I thought it was a unique and fun packaging and it went beyond my expectations.

I felt the packaging for the product was great and secure. The DVDs are in booklets which are a bit awkward since they slide into the packaging instead of popping out, but they're definitely secure and are inside of the large box it comes in (as can be seen in the picture)
That large brick looking thing comes in its own box, so definitely safe and secure for shipping.

4077360,5,B0036EH3WU,"I have followed lost from season one.  I think it is a very special show, and this is a great set.  The set does have it's shortcomings, which many others have stated.  But none of them really bother me.  The quality of the set, the picture quality on blu-ray, and the extras are all top notch in my opinion.  Worth getting for a lost enthusiast.

I know many people hated the end of season 6.  I thought it was properly done.  I can see people hating it, and I respect that.  It cracks me up how many people are arguing on these reviews over it.

For anyone who has not watched the show, it is a one of a kind experience in my opinion.  Season 2 & 3 were absolutely great television.  Like I said, I enjoyed season 6.  I enjoyed every season.  It really kept me thinking throughout the series and kept me guessing.  Not all answers you want will be answered, but the show is called Lost, and I am fine with that.

Now, let me leave some space for Earnest to tell you how bad season 6 was:",1282867200,,989,4.099476439790576
4077361,5,B0036EH3WU,"As it has already been debated in reviews and on forums, I'm not going to comment on Lost as a series, other than to state that I loved it - I'd have to go back to the original Star Trek to name a series that so held my attention.  Why would I have bought the complete series on Blu-ray if it hadn't?  So, here is my review on the particulars in this collection.

The 1080p image quality on Blu-ray is spectacular, far eclipsing what could be seen either on the original ABC broadcast (even HD broadcast, which was 720p) and the conventional DVD issues.  Hitherto unseen details are readily apparent here, starting in the opening minutes of the pilot, where the bamboo forest is dazzlingly clear, as is the riveting post crash sequence.  If you don't already have a Blu-ray player, this set is good incentive to get one.  From what I can see, there has been no digital noise reduction, so there are instances of grain, especially in darker sequences - but this is not distracting, and adds to the gritty realism of the show.  In short, the video quality is far above what is seen on modern series television, and looks more like a big budget movie.

Audio is also superb, with 5.1 mix for English leading the pack.  Dialogue is boldly front & center, with plenty of activity in the surround channels.  But unlike many 5.1 mixes, the dialogue is never swamped.  5.1 audio is also available for French, European Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese.  Latin American Spanish is available in stereo only.

There are over 30 options for subtitles, including, but not limited to, English, Spanish (both European & Latin American), Portuguese, Swedish, Thai, Korean, and a host of others.  The subtitles are offered both as dialogue only, or with descriptions for the hearing impaired.  Caveat: Not all spoken language and subtitles appear in each episode.  Options are inconsistent, which is rather annoying.

Beyond the extras that came with the previous sets (bloopers, behind the scenes featurettes, interviews, all of which are ported over to the complete collection) there are some additional goodies that come with the boxed set.  For the most part, these are of the toy/game variety: a map of the island, Senet gameboard with white and black stones for playing, a log entry from the Black Rock, a black-light for viewing some hidden items, and an ankh with a hidden hieroglyphic message from Jacob - the message deals with how to find an additional disc hidden in the box.

Now to the bonus disc: the disc is hidden under the map of the island on the underside of the box top.  The easiest way to get to it is to place the box top with the ""LOST"" side down on a hard surface.

If you loved Lost, you'll probably want to get this set.  It's a true collector's item.  If you're unfamiliar with Lost or lukewarm on it, but want to see more, my advice would be to sample episodes from a rental service or your local library before diving into this collection.",1282867200,11,3338,4.623089983022071
4077362,5,B0036EH3WU,"Since its debut in 2004 Lost has received 43 Emmy nominations. For its freshman season Lost won the Emmy for Outstanding Drama and it comes as no surprise that it has once again been nominated for Outstanding Drama for its sixth and final season. To categorize Lost into one genre is near impossible. It is a mystery, it is a an epic, it a character study, it is science fiction, it is fantasy, it is a love story, it is a philosophical debate... it is all of this in one brilliantly executed story about life, death, and redemption. I have never seen a television show border on art before and make no mistake, Lost is cinematic art at its best. The show is not for everyone, however. If you want mindless entertainment, a linear narrative, and obvious resolutions, this is not the show for you. Like the best works of fiction, there is an ambiguity to the story that requires an individual to analyze and reflect on the narrative and what the author (or in this case authors) is really trying to say with their story. For those who choose to look at and analyze the many layers of Lost will be rewarded with thought-provoking and sometimes goose-bump inducing payoffs. What will make Lost a timeless epic is not the mystery, but the journey the show takes to answer that mystery. If the creative team behind Lost created an interesting journey, long after the mysteries are revealed, the show itself will stand the test of time.

As for the Complete Collection, it is well worth the money. The box set itself is a work of art. What looked somewhat cheesey in the promo pictures looks very classy and high quality in person. A lot of love went into this set and its something I can proudly display on my entertainment center. I own the Blu Ray version of the show and having popped in a few episodes from various seasons, the show never looked or sounded this good during its initial broadcast. In fact, most movies do not look or sound as good as Lost does.

True fans of this show will love the Complete Collection. If you have never seen Lost before and want to pick up this set on a blind buy, I implore you to forget any doubts, ignore the naysayers and come into it with an open mind. If you do this, you will not be disappointed.

1. Did ABC really have to put ""ABC Studios"" on the blacklight? What could have been a really cool memento (or artifact, really) has to be emblazoned with ABC Studios... because we all know there was a Disneyland Island, right?
2. Who watched the final product? Was it truly necessary to put a PREVIEW for Season 1 and 2 on DVD on the Blu-ray? I can't even fathom the logic here. Let's say I buy a car. A Ford. And when I get in the car there's a pre-recorded message telling me to go to my Ford dealer and check out the vast selection of Ford cars. That's ridiculous, right? Apparently not if you're ABC.

There are some areas of concern, however, with the durability of the packaging even though out of the box the set feels durable. The bottom corners of the case are already peeling despite delicate attention. I can also see the tab connected to the top panel, allowing access to the Blu-rays, eventually ripping the beautifully crafted Lost sticker holding the tab in place.

BOX SET SPOILER!
The hidden disk under the map of the island was an amazing touch and so much fun to find, but the tabs that hold the two pieces together are already starting to fall apart. This problem was easily fixed it with some tape where most of the ware occurred.

4077368,5,B0036EH3WU,"This is a review of the box set itself - not the series...

Love or hate the finale (I personally hated the whole afterlife bit and was disappointed that there were so many unanswered questions), this is one of the sweetest DVD box sets I've ever seen.  The care and detail that went into the production on the box, game, hidden features, etc is amazing.

Answers to a number of the unanswered questions from the series are sprinkled throughout this set (and not all are in the new 12-minute ""The New Man in Charge"" - make sure to read through the page from the Black Rock journal for one).

A lot of people have been wondering what the secret message from Jacob contained inside the ankh translates to (it's a series of hieroglyphs and arrows next to them).  The hieroglyphs may translate into a message, but what it is supposed to be is a clue for finding the extra bonus DVD hidden elsewhere in the set (Hint - look for something that has the same hieroglyphs on it and figure out what the arrows mean).

I haven't yet had a chance to watch all of the bonus features - I've been too busy ""playing"" with the set itself and discovering all the cool features (like the black light map).

While the show may have ended with a bit of a fizzle, two seconds into opening this box set I found myself once more excited about the mysteries that had me so enthralled by the past 6 years.

I only wish we got to see MORE of Hurley, Ben (and the other character who is given a ""job"" in the new segment in this set) on the island...",1282694400,2,1521,4.275261324041812
4077369,3,B0036EH3WU,"I just received my LOST: THE COMPLETE COLLECTION box set in the mail today. Have given it a preliminary going-over without checking the discs first, but there's a reason I'm doing this: it's to give some of you a ""caveat emptor"" in case you were thinking of buying it. I will add to this review at a later date.

My immediate gripe with this set was threefold. The first has to do with the ankh that is included. Maybe this won't come as a surprise to some, but that ankh looks like it was carved by a 7th-grader in Wood Shop class...the picture on the front of the box set tends to lead you to believe that the ankh is an accurately-carved one. Second, the relief-map replication of the island was supposed to have been mounted on an ornately-illustrated piece of carboard--all well & good, if it weren't for the fact that it was mounted crooked! Seems like it might have been put into the box before the adhesive had actually dried!

Third--and absolutely infuriating to me--is that the illustration of each season of the series' folder-style containers leads you to believe that, like the individual series box sets, the DVDs are mounted on plastic with spindles. NOT THE CASE. Just like when I ordered the box set of M*A*S*H: MARTINIS & MEDICINE, the DVDs were NOT treated with TLC by the manufacturers. Instead of the disc-friendly plastic spindles, the discs were SHOVED into those hard-cardboard slots that we all know and love so much. In the MMM collection, nearly 15 of those discs were scratched so severely that they were unplayable; fortunately for me, I have one of those automated CD/DVD repair units that, more often than not, fixes the problem. I have not yet inspected the discs in this set individually (just received it about an hour ago) but, as stated, my point here is to alert all of you to these obvious breaches of quality in a box set that otherwise appears to be very nicely put together. I'm glad I got one at such a good discount, but it's beginning to look like I got what I paid for, if you get my drift. More to come--stay tuned...",1282694400,6,2064,4.545698924731183
4077380,5,B0036EH3WU,"For those wanting to know about bonus features, this set contains all the bonus features that the individual seasons did, including the easter eggs. Some of the formatting is different. Season 3, rather than having to hunt through screens to find content there is just a list. And it also has a ""Access Granted"" section that has the creaters giving some answers to questions which is nice. I don't believe that was on the original. So along with the bonus features you've gotten on all 6 seasons, their is also a hidden disk in the lid with more bonus features. All in all I'm very happy with this set. I'll be selling the original copies I got as their is no reason to keep them around aside from their packaging.",1282694400,5,714,4.5

You get a nice book with a description of every episode in the series.  A replica of the Senet game played by Jacob and The Man in Black.  Complete with white and black stones.  The cover of the set holds a map of the Island on the reverse.  An Ankh with a secret message in it.  A black light pen light to help you ""see"" some extra writings around the whole set.

For anyone who already has the first 5 seasons, you may want to save your money since most of its contents are just for fun and have no practical use. However, if you are like me and either don't have any of the seasons, or are converting to Blu Ray, I highly recommend this box set. It's much cheaper than purchasing them individually and the presentation/contents make it more enjoyable.

For anyone who either already has it, or will be purchasing it, will notice one of the items is a Dharma Initiative black light. They provided this for a reason (although it's nothing huge). Play around with it (hint: perhaps inside the box?).

Received mine in the mail today. Incredible! There are a few surprises (which I will not spoil). There is one in particular that when you find it you won't be able to help but say to yourself (or to anyone else in the room at the time) ""Oh, cool!"" I make a humble plea to other reviewers to please, please keep those surprises intact for everyone else (shhhhh!). The island has its way of showing us things we do not expect.

Lost is one of the most profound, rich, and esoteric series to be unleashed on network television since the Twilight Zone. If you are into the deeper questions of existence, existentialism, and the great mystery of good and evil you will not get answers here; but you will get fodder for the questions, and endless material for speculation. I think you have to be willing to leave some things to mystery in order to be satisfied. If you want quick, easy answers, and neat tidy endings - STAY AWAY!

Lost is a journey that does not end with episode 16 of season six. Hey, I've seen every episode and I'm still on the journey. It is the series that will never end - for any of us who let it flow through our veins.

The packaging is fantastic (one of the finest, most creative packages I have seen for complete TV series - and I own a lot of them. This beats my Complete Seinfeld Refrigerator all to hell.). The set is housed inside of a corrugated box inside of another outer display box, so it ships well. The only ""flaw"" I could find is that 2 or 3 disc in each season had a little glue on the edges. I have seen this in other complete season packages. What I do is pull the stuck discs firmly out of their slot and apply some lighter fluid to a soft cloth. Hold the saturated area of the cloth on the gluey edge for a few seconds, then wipe gently. The glue will slide right off.

Ankh you very much to the creators of Lost, ABC studios, and everyone who had a hand in designing this set. - job well done. It was made to last a lifetime...perhaps many lifetimes.",1282608000,68,2165,4.583979328165374

Abrams sort of is a kid and well, gets carried away after seasaon three.  First off, they're are far far FAR to many NEW characters that keep popping up like Muppets in a ""capor"" from Under Jim henson's table, every season.  I liked the first batch, with Sayide, Lock, Jack, Kate, Sawyer, and co. liked all of them. and I'm not going to sit here and even list every first wave's name either,(Jin, Sun, Charlie, Hurley, his ""brother in arms""lol, Claire, miss her!, Ben, and Walt  and the summer locked chic and her metrosexual brother too.(miss her too he was a good actor anyway) the stories from that era were gripping, the best ever told! But later(post 2006 though intro of newbees was annoying even then) it was sloppy and like everything on TV, Sawyer was a woose, Kate was his boss, Jack was, well, a Jerk, Loch was getting silly so on.  And above all, I(and other audiences) were slowly then totally by 2008 loosing interest, I once eagerly awiated a season's closing/opening but lately when I am called by a friend/relative and they say ""Hey lost is on, wanna watch"" I am not even interested enough to turn on the boob tube, I instead play ""Far Cry"" a game ten times better than the new plots of lost. HA!  The writing of Abrams, once was excellent, now noting but what everyone does, he has ""gone to pot"", you might say and it shows in ""Star Trek"" The movie, what a lame!  As a capeable writer, his ""distributers"" may have had a hand in ""telling him"" what to write, I don't know, same unfortunate fated ""accident' happend to John Maxell Anderson's many flop's in the '80's like ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Family Ties"" as well as ""Diffrent Strokes"" going from funny and ""cute"" to stupid and lame with formulatic ""puns"" nobody truely cared about or they were lying to themselves if they did!  I cannot imagine a writer thinking he can get by with introducing (regulars) on a regular basis for too late in the show.  In novel writing and that goes for scripts it is stated one must NEVER introduce a ""new"" protag after about half of the book.  College Writing.  Because, put simply, it distracts the audience from what they are used too. stunns them then when they get ""warmmed up"" to a ""newbie"" you go and dump the hind quarter of the plane on them! and abandon Jack Kate, Lock, ect. and that's stupid and unrealatable! anyone with a different ""opinion"" an keep it to themselves I could care less.

LOST offers you a journey into a world of deep character connections, thought provoking stories, and almost no fillers. Unlike many TV shows in today's day and age, LOST does not attempt to simplify or reduce the complexity of its story for newcomers. If you don't start at the beginning and watch sequentially you will be Lost.

That being said, I personally think this was one of the most well done shows to date. It had me passionate, immersed, and deep in thought for 6 years, emotions that no other TV show has come even close to obtaining.

This show is also laden heavily with mysteries. And if you are paying attention most of these mysteries and questions will be answered, though others will be left open. If you want to be spoon fed answers then this may not be the show for you, but if you want to have to interpret, analyze and thinking about the questions and answered provided, then you will be more satisfied with LOST then any other show.

This does not mean that the writers of this show will answer every question with a deep mathematical proof for life. the answers may be vague or up to some interpretation. This is all part of making a good mystery. If everything is proven and answered to death, you lose the deep complex storytelling and end up with another mindless sitcom.

If this sounds like a show you might like, then I would definitely recommend picking up at least the first season if not the entire collection, and I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",1282348800,4,1647,4.494983277591973

 UPDATE 
Above was my initial review. I figured I'd elaborate a little more.

This is the entire LOST series in a gorgeous Blu-ray set. The main box is made of a sturdy cardboard material. All the content is contained in a three-dimensional trapezoid brick shape. It looks like something that could exist in the LOST universe.

Lift the brick cover up and you'll see a very cool dimensional map of The Island. From here, you are presented with three main compartments. The top and bottoms have special items: a black and white pebble game (from the show), a black light, an ankh, and a letter. The middle section houses a booklet that serves as an episode guide. Below that are six booklets that store all six seasons of the series.

 A BOX WITH A SECRET 
There is one last secret. All the items that I just mentioned are given to you for a reason. Figure out why you have them, and how to use them, and you'll discover and be rewarded with a bonus item.

This Blu-ray set is great and tops all the individual season sets that came before it. Opening this up and exploring the contents feels like you've uncovered a box of secrets, just like in the show. Recommended.",1282176000,9,1305,4.4641350210970465

4077430,5,B0036EH3WU,I've had my favorite tv shows and just never thought another series could live up to my expectations like those from the past but LOST is such an epic series. This complete set is what I've been waiting for and can't wait to see Hurley and Ben as #1 and #2. Hopefully the fake LOST fans complaining about the last season will get a brain. Long live TRUE LOST FANS that love it all.,1281830400,10,381,4.162162162162162
4077431,5,B0036EH3WU,"The show:
Lost is one of those shows that re-defined what television is supposed to be. To put it simply, this show is one of the deepest, most well-written programs with fascinating 3-dimensional characters who grow and change in such immense ways and an immensely interesting mythology which, although not explained fully, is still explained quite thoroughly and in the end leaves less than 20% of the mysteries presented (which depending on the viewer's personal perception, range from inane and unimportant to very important) unsolved (or at least not solved directly). For anyone who hasn't already viewed the entire series, know that your overall satisfaction will ultimately be determined by whether you care more about the mysteries (most of which do get answered, though some are less direct than others) or whether you care more about the characters and their journeys on the island. Either way, this show is one you really have to watch all the way through for yourself (as there are viewers, particularly in the 1-star reviews, who were disappointed with the final season and the end of the show) to determine whether or not you want to shell out the cash for a complete collection.

(In case you're wondering where I get the ""less than 20% unsolved"" figure, one person went through the entire series multiple times and wrote down every single question asked and gave detailed answers to any of the questions answered as presented by the show and other ""canonical"" pieces, while equally showing which questions were not answered. LOST, in total, had 663 total mysteries, 536 answered mysteries, and 127 unanswered mysteries. Here's the link for those who have seen the series and want concrete results:[...]).

The collection itself:
I pre-ordered the BD collection and JUST received it in the mail yesterday. The Blu-Ray collection is far superior in terms of picture (especially for such a lush setting as Hawaii, where the show was filmed, is) and sound compared to the DVD standard definition. Disney (the parent company of ABC), as with anything else they put out on BD, has done an absolutely excellent job making this show look gorgeous and give HDTVs a run for their money. The only real downside comes with the earlier seasons (which were released on BD around the same time as the third season, as the technology wasn't being used prior to that) in which some of the special features (including the episodes with commentaries) are still in standard definition. Of course, seeing the SD commentary episodes after watching the HD episodes makes it really clear how much better the HD versions look.

Now I was originally not all that thrilled about all of the extra stuff (as I mostly just wanted the show itself), but now I can gladly say that the extras are worthwhile. The overall box is solid with great design. The Senet game (which does not come with rules, as there is some debate about what the ACTUAL rules are, but you can find the supposed rules online easily) is interesting/fun. There are Easter eggs throughout the box, including one particular thing that is only visible with a black light (which is provided), a page from the Black Rock journal (revealing the answer to another mystery), and a hidden bonus disk that you can find using the note from Jacob inside the Ankh and the black light (I won't divulge how to find it as it's more fun to figure it out on your own).

The only minor annoyances (and believe me, they are minor) are that (1) Senet doesn't come with any rules (although as explained above, it's because no one knows the rules for sure, but the supposed rules can be found online easily enough) and (2) the cases for the disks are too tall to fit on a standard DVD shelf. Of course, the cases are really nice looking (with artwork and such from the corresponding season) and solid, so that pretty much makes up for that minor inconvenience.

Overall, this set is worth the $195 Amazon is charging. If you are already a Lost fan, do not already have the BD versions of the seasons (and actually have a Blu-Ray player/PS3), and have the money, it's worth it. If you already own the seasons on BD or can't afford this right now, it's worth waiting for. But once again, DON'T BUY IT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE WHOLE SERIES! Watch it first and THEN decide.

Before you go reading the 1 star reviews on here, just realize those are people unhappy with the ending of the entire series.  It's completely their right to have a negative opinion, but what's comical is how they are trying to make their opinions facts.

The series was ALWAYS about the characters, and in the end we got a resolution of their stories.  The sci-fi, mysteries, and questions all were second place to some fantastic character creation and story arcs throught the six seasons.

Are there mysteries on the show which will capture your imagination?  You bet!
Do those mysteries take a backseat to the characters and their development?  You bet!

Are there questions on this show that will never be answered?  You bet!

You see... Lost... like life... DOESN'T GIVE YOU THE ANSWER TO EVERY QUESTION!!!  And it shouldn't!

Don't knock a series because your expectations are to be spoon fed every answer to everything.  I guess it's a shame that the writers/creators of Lost didn't expain why the grass was green or the ocean was blue on the show too.  Oh yeah, and how did the birds we see on the series actually fly again?  I guess we need those answers too, or the series was horrible.

Just because YOU thought you deserved an answer to a particular question doesn't mean all of America was thinking the same thing.

Go back and watch the series again, and this time ACTUALLY RELAX and let yourself be taken on the journey.

ONLY THEN will you understand the destination of the ending...

GREAT SERIES!  5 STARS!!!!",1281225600,9,1568,4.758364312267658
4077434,3,B0036EH3WU,"I love TV shows and - probably like you - I've watched tons of them. But I no longer feel as enthused about the plots as I did before. Especially with ""Multi Season"" shows.
The main reason is because, most of the times - if not every time -, those responsible for the plot (the writers) have no idea how it's going to end. And LOST is what one could call a ""Case Study"" for this. You can be sure that, as you watch the first and second seasons, writers had no intent - at that time - to end the story the way they did. They didn't have a clue on how to end it. Take the time and watch actor interviews at the first and second season's end and it will become obvious.
And there isn't a single hint that you can honestly say ""I could have had this whole thing figured out in the first season, had I noticed this before"" - it's probably the other way around.
Another thing writers tend to do is up the stakes to incredible heights in the end (in BSG, the same happened) - so that you won't feel you've been wasting your time.
If you're still not convinced writers don't have a clue how the plot is going to end, just consider this: the end is not up to the writers: it's about the audiences' expectations (namely how they feel the show should end) and producers' strategies.
Keep in mind every show is a ""product"".
In the end, what writers have to do is make sure that the finale they ended-up-with is somehow coherent with the first seasons. And let's face it: ending LOST the way they did is the easiest way out imaginable! they didn't even have to bother ""wrapping up"" most of the subplots: our minds will make some sense of them somehow.
Perhaps my bitterness can be justified in trying to find genius and art where there is none to be found: only a product, deserving as much consideration by a specialized marketing team as a new detergent.

That said, still a very decent show, considering the formulaic crap we are fed everyday.",1280707200,5,1933,4.281420765027322
4077435,5,B0036EH3WU,"Some peeps are crazy if you ask me. To go on loving the show for five seasons and then dismissing it comletely after the turnout of season six. The vibe that six put off made it ok for me to let the show end at the end, but luckily there are still many mysteries that are left to the viewer to be solved at the end, without the aid of any clarification.  Without a doubt in my book, the best fictional Tv series that has ever been made.

These cats that hate on the ending seem to have gotten way to confused, and then forgot that this show is all about opening your mind to different possibilities, that they dismiss the whole series for the slightest possibility they can explain, and then make it out like the show made it too simple. Uh-oh, look again. I'm not saying that I figured out all the answers, but anytime I re watch an episode of the near hundred twenty hours of this program, I always feel like I'm getting something new for the whole puzzle...there is substance to everything... it's like a piece of cake that weighs the same as a brick.

John Locke was a small man. Follow him from the begginig to the end, and you will see how the island seduced him into becoming the center of evil and then plays him like a pawn. I honestly love what happens to Locke in season six, as he becomes the wise cracking puppet of the smoke-- who, suprise suprise, was just trying to end up with everyones soul by the end. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't thats not really of any significance, and we'll probably never find out for certain, but its the journey, not the destination that counts here. This show is a brain melter all the way through, and always interesting and fun to follow. I'm glad I waited out on buying the DVDS because now I can just grab it all up in one swoop, with whatever extras come with. I will probably dissapear for a few days once this thing comes in the mail.",1280016000,4,1886,4.247910863509749
4077436,2,B0036EH3WU,"Forget it! The only way this show worked was by stringing it out over such a long period of time that you forget almost 75% of the things you hear over the seasons.

This show had so much magic, character development, mystery, and epic battles that it was such a shame to end it the way it did.

If you watch this show from beginning to end you will feel very let down by the ending. Not to say it isn't a good ending, but it's an ending of a SEASON not of a SERIES. This show left absolutely way too much unanswered.

In the middle of Season 6 I ordered this set. After the show ended, I canceled my order. Why rewatch the entire show only to know it ends without answering all the things you wanted to know about?",1279670400,9,715,4.056737588652482

4077438,1,B0036EH3WU,"I was the biggest Lost fan that I knew. I listened to dozens of podcast about the show every week. I never missed an episode and I regularly visited dozens of message boards and by the end I was a regular guest on a podcast about Lost.

It was a great show, with so many fantastic mysteries that just had to lead to a big picture. Season one was fantastic, season two was great, season three slipped a little, but ended on a very high note and with the promise that everything was going to be answered with the end date the gave of 6 seasons. However, by the middle of the sixth season the writers were backtracking and trying to convince us it was about the characters.

Lost had great characters, it's true, but they were only part of it. The mysteries are what kept us watching. The mysteries are why we watched the show and while things like unexplained character motivations, odd circumstance and strange events happened throughout the show you had faith in the writers that it would all come together in the end. Afterall they said it would all mean something....they promised.

That didn't even remotely happen. Don't lie to yourself because if you were to rewatch the show it will still be a series of confusing, almost non-sensical events. No 15 minutes of extra footage can help that. It's not a complete story it is an exercise in using the new media and cliffhangers to create a successful television show and then use that same medium to convince loyal viewers that the reasons they watched were not really the reasons.

Season 6, the final season of the show is one of the worst things to ever be on television. The show had fabulous actors, but they were all zombies in this season and not just the 2 that were supposed to be. They mindlessly walked through the sets and every episode was just stalling until the final one where the writers would give us one last twist that the flash sideways was an afterlife. Not only that, but it made the first 5 seasons unrewatchable.

The writers couldn't tie any of it together so they preyed upon our emotions and tried to use it against our logical brains that were screaming ""FOUL!"". It worked on some of us, those that are praising the final season, but a very large amount of people are still fuming about this after almost 3 months. How can you try and convince me that all the things we all talked about over the last 6 years didn't matter because they all ended up together after they died? What about a cohesive plot?

There is no reason to buy this box set. Most of us have the first 5 good seasons on dvd, or Itunes and they are actually free on Netflix to watch instantly. So why bother? Season 6 is worse than any Star Wars prequel or Indiana Jones by a longshot, putting it in a box with all the rest of the show doesn't change anything.",1279411200,52,2807,4.4197292069632494

2nd - this product is not released yet, so this is not a review of the quality of the dvd or blu-ray picture, 5.1 sound, cover art, special features or anything else about the DVD or Blu-ray release that you can buy here on Amazon.

If you are going to purchase and watch entire Complete Lost series (including season 6 and the final episode) you need to be aware that Lost is a religious story.

The series taps into the Biblical Old Testament and other religious stories, updated to the modern world for the sake of portraying good vs evil in the context of human frailties.

The plot, with it's many improbable and irrational circumstances, wanders for season after season and most events are irrelevant to the final ending.

By the time the series ends you'll find out that the Main Character, the Island itself, is nothing more than essentially a magical floating toilet bowl filled with golden yellow liquid that if it gets flushed into the Pacific Ocean the World will be destroyed.

One major plot line is dedicated to weeding out 107 of 108 possible new toiletmasters who will take over the responsibilities of the current toiletmaster to protect the toilet and the flush mechanism.

The other major plot line follows a small group of the 108 that go through many trials and tribulations which allows them to eventually be able to See The Light and Move On into the Hereafter.

If that is of interest to you, you should buy and watch the Complete Lost.

4077451,2,B0036EH3WU,"But for repeat viewings, this show does not hold up at all. By the end of the sixth season there are simply too many plot holes, unanswered questions, and loose ends that if you were to rewatch the entire series you would scratch your head multiple times and say ""hey wait a minute...?""

But if this is your first time viewing this show, you will not have invested the time others have in the show, so you might not care if every detail is neatly tied up or not. If you've been watching the show from day one, then you will most likely not share this sentiment, but I don't need to explain that.

Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, the showrunners, clearly had no idea what direction they wanted their show to head in, so they made up everything as they went along. They may have had the final image in their head at the very start, but it takes no genius to see how they settled on it. Even their ""proof"" that they had it all figured out since the first season (the skeletons in the cave) contradicts itself when it's first presented to when it's resolved in the sixth season. Before the finale aired the writers tried to distance themselves from the dozens of unresolved mysteries and loose ends by stating that the show is about the characters. Lindelof himself has said that the island itself is the most important character on the show, so if the show really is about the characters, then the writers admittedly failed.

And besides, the show hasn't been about the human characters on the show since season 4, when character development was completely sacrificed for plot (and got so tangled the writers themselves couldn't even keep up with everything). Reasons for character actions used to be gradually orchestrated over the course of a season, and usually everything a character does lines up with what we have seen previously. By the season five finale, a character goes from opposing something devastating from happening to suddenly supporting it, with the excuse for her doing so as ""she changed her mind."" In the same episode. Then they try to offer a more elaborate explaination, but it's so obvious the writers needed to twist the character in order to fit the plot, not the other way around. No, this show hasn't been about the people for years.

But if you're looking for an entertaining show to hold your attention, this is a great show. My bitterness only stems from the fact that I've watched this show since day one and have absolutely loved it, and I believed the writers when they said they knew what they were doing and everything had a purpose. It is undeniable that this show is entertaining, and oftentimes moving, but I can't give the show itself a good score because there are so many inconsistances. If you're looking for a show with meaning, substance, and overall sustainablilty, this is not your show.",1278720000,6,2832,4.6467065868263475
4077452,1,B0036EH3WU,"Which is why millions of people communed on message boards and around water coolers across the nation, to discuss at great length and depth the characters of the show.  There were so many theories and much, much speculation as to the state of Sun and Jin's marriage, and whether Jack would ever find reconciliation with his deceased father.  Everyone wondered if Michael would ever find forgiveness in the eyes of his estranged son, Walt.  Will Hurley ever find love again? Will Kate and Sawyer be able to escape their turbulent pasts?  Will Sayid ever be able to forgive himself? Yes, these were the discussions taking place on message boards and around water coolers for the past 6 years.  No, wait... I'm remembering that wrong.

I've loved Lost since it premiered in 2004.  I've followed the show faithfully, which is why, even to this day, when I talk about Lost, I get pissed.  Really pissed.  Without ""spoiling"" anything, I will say this:  What ""answers"" (and I use that term loosely... VERY loosely) the writers did give us were the kind of answers that parents give children who ask questions they either don't know the answer to, or are just too lazy to answer intelligently.

4077454,2,B0036EH3WU,"Where do pressing questions go if they want to remain unanswered forever? They go LOST... :) - Mysteries have a tendency in LOST to seem be so important as to let the world depend on them (sometimes quite literally!), while in fact there's not really much there that deserves thinking it through. That's the sad truth after the curtain went down on this show after a mostly extremely bland final season. Even the iconic moments the show definitely featured during the first seasons to a great deal become meaningless on retrospect. Even main characters that were set up as key players in the grand scheme of things turn out to have no clue whatsoever eventually. So the authors choose not to reveal too much as they go along, just tease, keep things interesting and suspenseful with immense cliffhangers and what not, yet often let mysteries die due to old age after some seasons have passed.

According to a website that collects all mysteries the show presented to us the series leaves us after the final episode with no less than over 60 major questions entirely unanswered and about 220 minor ones that aren't addressed properly either. The show turns out to be more like a puzzle construction kit where you can put together what you like and how you like it, but a deeper meaning is, well, seriously LOST. If you are lured into the intriguing web of enigmas and hope that there might be light at the end of the tunnel revealing what island, monster, the so-called others, the legendary numbers or that fabled guy Jacob are all about, you're in for major disappointments. The characters are basically running around in circles, dealing with and fighting against what they don't know. Which is especially difficult to watch in the final season, where the few things that are dealt with turn out to be a mess standing on shaky feet, and the ending feels tucked on. There are in fact only seasonal arcs, peppered with references to what is yet unknown at the point of a particular episode, but the arc that connects it all, even semi-constructively, is missing entirely.

""It's all about the characters"" the show runners explain their lack of interest to deal with answers and yet they threw in one twist after another in six years, thus building the ""character"" of the island. Only to leave that latter as shallow as you can possibly imagine. There are dozens of fan theories out there which prove to be way more creative than what the LOST writers managed to come up themselves - which isn't that difficult if you consider that the master plan was to just focus on one aspect of the show in the end, leaving everything else to everyone's own imagination.

""Every question you ask will only lead to more questions"" someone says in the final season implying to stop asking questions altogether. I recommend not to start with it, as in case you do you're likely to crash like flight 815 on trying to process the material. You can watch the show for light entertainment with no expectations, and you might enjoy it thoroughly from beginning to the end. However, LOST promised to be so much more given the grand themes that were set up in the first seasons.

Thus: 2 out of 5 from me for the whole series, which ultimately didn't deliver. Especially the last season makes a good deal you've watched entirely pointless. Oh, maybe there's one message the show really conveys effectively: Get over it, move on! Point taken.",1277510400,17,3418,4.710702341137123
4077455,1,B0036EH3WU,"EDIT: August 19, 2010
In the past 24 hours, there have been (5) reviews with a 5 star rating that all say about the same thing. 4 of those ""reviews are 2-4 sentences long and the 5th is a short paragraph. Does that seem suspicious to anyone? Could there actually be a concerted effort to SELL this series to the unsuspecting Newcomer? My answer is MOST certainly there is a real SALES effort taking place. BE CAREFUL Newcomers. There are con-men roaming about ""The Amazon"".

""LOST"" was never primarily about the characters. ""LOST"" was about the mysteries on and surrounding the Island. The characters played a SUPPORTING role for the mysterious Island, not the other way around.

Do you want to know some shows that were ALL ABOUT the characters? How about ""Friends"" or ""Frazier""? In those shows, those characters did basically nothing and basically went nowhere. Those shows were ENTIRELY character driven.

I never saw MYSTERIES being introduced into those shows, but somehow some people have come to the conclusion that ""LOST"", with ALL of it's non-stop mysteries, was about the characters???? PLEASE!!!!!

If ""LOST"" was about the characters, then those characters were IDIOTS, because THEY BELIEVED that the MYSTERIES WERE IMPORTANT. Those characters spent their entire 6 seasons racing around to figure those mysteries out. WHAT FOOLS those characters were. They were even WORSE than the ""average"" viewer, because while we all THOUGHT that ""LOST"" was all about the mysteries, we were ONLY watching. Those MORON characters were actually ACTING as if the mysteries mattered. Just how DUMB could those characters be??????

And in the end, we find out that NOTHING MATTERED. No matter who did what to whom, they ALL end up bathing ""in the light"". Those characters NEVER had to do anything. They never had to fix anything. They never had to understand anything. In the end, EVERYONE ends up in the same place NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!

But the TRUTH is that ""LOST"" was ALWAYS about the MYSTERIES.

Now for the REAL story about Lost......

Lost is an incredibly interesting program with more mysteries and clues than you will know what to do with. Seriously, it's fun and amazing, at least at first.

But when it's all said and done and you get to the finale of season 6, it will be painfully obvious that you have been conned all along. 95% of the mysteries are never solved. They are completely ignored in the end.

For 6 years, the writers of Lost convinced the viewers to wait for the 6th season to have all of the many mysteries revealed in a cohesive story. They asked us to have FAITH.

When season 6 was over, 95% of the mysteries were left unsolved. That was the BETRAYAL.

What other TV series strung the audience along for so long without answering questions from seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 simply by promising to deliver in season 6 and then simply ignoring 95% of those questions in the end?

One 5 star reviewer has been working very diligently to find the answers to a list of MANY unsolved mysteries. You can find the 4 minute video by searching

college humor lost

The 5 star reviewer has come up with quite an interesting list of answers by finding an answer here, another one over there, and making some of them up on his own.

But my question is this......

How many people buy a NEW CAR in parts? Does the salesman direct us to one location for the fenders, another place for the bumpers, another .......... until the customer has a complete car that THEY have to put together themselves?

Nope, we all buy our NEW CARS in one, cohesive, and satisfying package.

People want that same satisfying package in their TV shows.

The writers of Lost told us that they would tie all of the mysteries from seasons 1 - 5 into a cohesive and satisfying story during season 6, and they did not do that.

The writers tried to pawn off various car parts to the viewers rather than provide us with a well made car.

SO MANY of the 5 star reviewers are trying to SELL ""Lost"" like it's the best thing since sliced bread. ""Hey everybody..... Lost is great! You don't need to be spoonfed everything. Just BUY it. Just watch it. Don't think, just FEEL...... blah blah blah""

Well MANY viewers see Lost for the con job that it was and they are speaking out about it.

Read the 1 star reviews to see what avid Lost fans think about the series now.

Another person has commented in a few threads that he suspects that some of the 5 star reviews are actually being written by people who have some connection to the show.

After reading so many reviews telling the readers to ""BUY, BUY, BUY"", I am inclined to agree that there are people posting here who are hired salesmen/women.

Every person should read this short story, which is readily available to read online.....

""The Emperor's New Clothes"" by Hans Christian Anderson. This story was published in 1837 in the book ""Fairy Tales Told for Children""

Hans speaks the simple wisdom that every child can easily understand.

The moral of the story is..... With enough propaganda, the average person can be made to believe ANYTHING.

There are A LOT of 5 star reviewers who are trying to convince people that ""Lost"" is a great show. Well Lost started out to be a great show, but the con-men writers put an end to that.

After you read ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", ask yourself why the 5 star reviewers are pushing so hard to convince you that ""Lost"" is so great.

All of the 1 star reviewers agreed that ""Lost"" was great until season 6, so why this HUGE disagreement now?

Just ponder that story for a while. Simple truths are usually the best.

And a note to ALL of the people who are voting ""yes or no"" on the ""helpful review""........

Vote NO if you are still afraid of the dark and sleep with a nightlight.

Vote YES if you can read this sentence.",1276992000,65,5789,4.596303501945525

Suddenly, debris rains down from heaven, a worst nightmare, a plane crash, sailing with the fury of hell in the sky, exploding into the screen and bringing with it a series of characters, whose stories are about to entwine, and lead us on an adventure of hope and sacrifice and love and spirituality, and as all true things have: mystery.

It is no wonder that the show was an overnight success, the first season reigning in enormous critical acclaim, fan interpretation, speculation and praise. The problem, mainly, is the length of the show, and with it, the feeling of `filler.' Dialogue that's drawn out and unnecessary, story arcs that feel `made up as they go along' and irrelevant, instances where you sit there thinking `Well that's just stupid', too much spoon feeding the audience, and really, not enough intelligence for such an expansive premise. Investing so much time in a series, instead you could watch about sixty movies, read twenty novels etc. People started turning off in season two, and based on untangling threads (Walt springs to mind) I know why.

However, by the end, it all seems worth it, you've lived another life, met characters you never would have known, and like most great things, felt a peculiarity, a curiosity, about the wonder of life itself. I can say a lot of negative things about how the show ground along, knowing that it would have been a five star show, no question, if it was perhaps only three seasons with a tighter and more fluid script, but looking back at it as a finished piece of work, it did its job, it told its story, and, for my money, it ended 'pretty' well.

Three and a half stars.",1276560000,6,1751,4.675324675324675
4077457,5,B0036EH3WU,"LOST has been an amazing ride. Never has a show sucked me in quite like Lost. From the opening episode I knew I was hooked and I never looked back. It has the best writers on the planet and they constantly keep you on your toes as you fall in love with this strange world. I can't even start to explain the amount of depth that this show is made up of. Every episode is important as it adds something new to the mythos of the series and to the characters themselves. At its core Lost is all about it's characters. Seldom does the plot get more spotlight then the characters themselves. This leads to some amazing characters that feel like real life human beings instead of fictional creations. They are all given a fair share of the spotlight through flashbacks that tell their story before the island.

Lost was never a show afraid to take risks. None of the characters were ever safe and Lost took no prisoners as main cast members meet the grave with some regularity throughout the series. It also never became stale as the actual narration theme changed every season which kept the series fresh and new every week. I won't elaborate on how the theme changed, but let's just say that every season had a unique focus. The actors all should receive a lot of praise as there is never a moment where they fail to utterly shock you with their brilliance. After all the writing would be nothing without great actors to bring these characters to life, and bring them to life they did.

LOST was not always perfect though. No series is as season five was a rare point where the characters were thrust into the background as the plot itself set the pace. Lost was always best when it told its story through it's characters. The rest of the series is amazing though. Even season five where it is disappointing it still finds ways to impress you with some stellar episodes mixed in.

Lost constantly referenced previous episodes, which I loved. You felt really rewarded for seeing a connection that your family or friends didn't recognize. Also there are a lot of literary referenced throughout the series along with philosophy, mythology and history. It really has a deep framework that it built its story on.

The main argument to the series is the most interesting part of the show. The old science vs religion is a major theme to the series. The main character Jack is a man of science. While another character Locke is a man of faith that believes everything happens for a reason. Seeing these two men argue both points throughout the series is always top notch entertainment. All of the characters evolve greatly from the person they were in the pilot to who they are in the end, but these two have the greatest arcs as both men change to understand each others point in different ways.

Now without giving anything away the series finale was brilliant. Never has a finale finished off a series so perfectly. Yes some of the answers are left to ponder, but that is one thing that makes Lost great. You have to use your brain in order to figure out some of the lesser mysteries, but I assure you there are clues to be found to figure them out. We simply haven't noticed them yet. Lost is a series that has a lot of replay value as you constantly catch pieces of the puzzle that you missed before, and with plots and characters this detailed you won't mind re-watching the series for decades to come.

If you've never seen the series or are just buying it to relive the greatest series of all time I highly recommend the series to fans of serialized dramas. I envy all of you new comers to Lost as you are at the beginning of the adventure. I wish I could relive it for the first time again as it is sorely missed in my life. For the rest of us that have taken the journey already we have to use this set to remember and to let go.

Update: I now have the set and I am blown away. The video quality is amazing and well worth the extra money for the blu ray. The packaging is also cool and filled with secrets of its own. The bonus features look immense and I will update you on the complete running time of the whole set.",1276473600,56,4117,4.40921052631579
4077458,5,B0036EH3WU,"LOST will forever be one of the greats, there isn't a doubt in my mind. Lost is a milestone that we will probably never see again, at least in our lifetime, on television. It will sit with the greats such as Seinfeld, The X-Files, Cheers, and The Twilight Zone as television that changed the future of other shows.

For starters, LOST would never have lasted without the internet. It was one of the first TV shows that inspired such a cult following and transformed the internet. Never before has there been a show that created such a whirlwind on the internet. It also appealed to a wide range of people, whether you be looking for an exciting, mysterious, action-packed hour of television with light comedy sprinkled in throughout, a romantic love story with touches of science-fiction, or perhaps a thought-provoking testament of faith with emphasis on characters. Whatever your interest, LOST is for you.

LOST begins with the record-setting most expensive pilot ever produced, and it doesn't disappoint. It is high intensity and will draw you in to the mysterious plot and the frightening island. However, as the series progresses, you will soon discover you care about the characters and their back-stories as much, if not more, than the plot. The gist of LOST is this: 48 people survive a plane crash and it will change their lives in ways they don't even know. Each of these people were ""bad"" people before the island. There's a criminal, a torturer, a mother who was going to give up her baby, a couple with marital issues, a doctor with a God complex and the incessant need to fix everything. That's just the beginning of a very diverse cast, each getting their own episode(s) dedicated to splicing flashbacks to life before the island and the on-island plot together, giving us the chance to connect to these people and understand them in ways we never do on any other show. We really see what drives them and what motivates them. We also see how their lives are changing rapidly. The island offers them a place of redemption, a second-chance, a place to start over and make good on their past misdeeds. That's what this show is about. It's about redemption. It's about giving a second chance. It's about letting go. It's about forgiveness. It's about these people finally coming to cope with their pasts. Of course, that's not all. Theres a very rich mythology and an on-island plot that got the world abuzz. It's mysterious. It's action packed. And this island is not as it seems. Who or what lies in the jungle? The island holds many secrets that lead to a bigger plot, one bigger than you can imagine. It's not just an island. It's a place with a rich history and an enormous secret. As you learn about the mysteries the island holds as well as the mysteries the characters hold, you will begin to make theories and predictions. It's a ton of fun.

The ending was very controversial. You'll either love it or hate it. All the mysteries won't be answered, but the major ones will. It would have been impossible to answer every single question (the list is very long...it gets longer after each episode.) However, the writers don't dumb the show down. You need to watch every episode and you can't fast-forward. In true LOST fashion, the answers were given, but you'll need to dig deeper to find them. The writers give you the puzzle pieces and you'll need to put them together (don't worry, the important ones are perfectly spelled out, but if you're looking for all the answers, be prepared to go back and rewatch, but trust me, they're there.) I find myself talking to people who also watch the show and were disappointed with the lack of answers, and I'll say, in response to a particular question, ""Well remember this, this and this from season 4? Or this from season 5? Well we just learned in season 6 that this happened, so obviously the answer is _____."" And then my friend will go, ""Ohhhh! That's pretty cool. I didn't catch that."" (Of course, I'm the LOST Addict that watches each season over again.)

As far as the ending in regards to story and character, it was perfect. It offered the perfect resolution and I am convinced the show has ended. It was satisfying, rich, and emotional. There will be no sequels, no movie deals, no spin-offs. The ending wrapped things up neatly and pretty much said, ""This was the story we wanted to tell and this is the ending...no if, and, or buts""...and that is something true LOST fans will really appreciate.

The music is beautiful. Michael Giachinno's score is phenomenal, beautiful, intense, and emotional depending on the scene. It really is fantastic.
The acting is brilliant. Terry O'Quinn (John Locke) deserves an Emmy, as do the rest of the cast, but his role was believable, heartfelt, and absolutley amazing. See Episode 4 of Season 1 and you'll just get a TASTE of what I'm talking about. It gets better as the series progresses and (no pun intended) finds itself.

If you watch LOST though, there is a RULE. No looking for spoilers. The best part of the show are the twists and turns. No spoilers, don't even Google it. You'll really regret it if you do.

So watch LOST. Order it now, no second thoughts. It tackles the tough questions: Can people be redeemed? It asks about faith: Are you a man of science or a man of faith? Can you BELIEVE? Well, I can definitively say, you can believe in LOST. Order it now, you'll be glad you did. If you don't know too much about the show besides my review, take a leap of faith...you'll be glad you did.",1276041600,11,5518,4.647540983606557

The first few episodes were probably the most memorable, and it only got better as the series progressed. From misery, sorrow, love, fate, betrayal, revenge, retribution, redemption and of course mystery this series has seen it all at its absolute finest. This show has really changed my life and has opened my eyes and my mind to the limitless possibilities life could offer. This show has made me into a strong believer of 'everything happens for a reason'. Every single thing on the show itself happens for a reason, and when it all unfolds slowly before your eyes you gain a deep appreciation and satisfaction. Some people criticize that not all 100% of the topics and enigmas on the show are fully explained, but I still feel satisfied the way the entire show played out and how it ended. LOST would not be the same if every single detail was illuminated and explicated. Looking back on the entire show, I enjoy feeling the great sense of mystery I once felt watching all of it when it all aired. There will never be another show that could come close. I could make this review go on forever telling how powerful the series is, but it is best to watch it for ones self and just enjoy every second of it!",1275782400,6,1289,4.48936170212766

Am I going to lose sleep and b&*ch at the writers for not spoon-feeding me every little answer(even though they promised they would)? HELL NO.
If they did, I wouldn't have had such a great time for the last 6 years talking/debating it with friends and family.

Not knowing everything about every character and the island is not going to ruin my overall experience of LOST.
Also for people complaining about the explanation of the sideways/purgatory/whatever you want to call it...can you explain the afterlife?...are you dead yet?  NO!  So why do you expect the writers to have a clear and concise explanation.

4077477,2,B0036EH3WU,"This is a review of the Complete 6 disc Collection, so the review is for the whole show.

But, since this 6 disc set contains hundreds of hours of viewing, I don't want to give away the ending.

So, I'll give you an analogy to help you determine if you want to spend the money for the Complete Collection.

The LOST Story would be like if I tell you a story about the best pig farm in the world.

I spend hours and hours telling you about the mud hole the pigs roll in, describing pig pens, hundreds of other interesting animal husbandry stuff.  I tell you about how the pig farmer is planning on getting more pigs, which will put the pigs in a crowded condition.

Since you are a pig farming enthusiast, you listen enthralled.

And, you're really worried about the pigs being too crowded, you want to hear more about what is going to happen to the pig pens.

But, then I start telling you about all the interesting animals on the pig farm.  Like the goose and the rats who steal the pig's food, the dog that protects the pigs from the wolves, and the chickens who lay the eggs.

I spend a lot of time telling you about a baby duck that always wanders to close to the snake pit.  You're worried about the baby duck.

Since you love animals, you listen intently and are enthralled.

And, you really want to know if the baby duck is going to get eaten by the snakes.

But, then I tell you about the Land Commissioner who want's to put a freeway through the land the pig farm is on.  I describe in detail the angry conversations between the pig farmer and the land commissioner.  The pig farmer and land commissioner get into a fist fight.

As a serious environmentalist, you continue to listen and are enthralled.

I tell you about the land surveyor who comes out and spends a lot of time petting the dog, in addition to measuring the land.

You are REALLY worried, you love the pig farm and you don't want to see it destroyed.

Then I tell you about the upcoming Holiday Season.  All the holiday decorations and how one of the string of lights is about ready to short out and burn the house down.  I tell you about the big holiday party that's planned.

And, how the pig farmer is going to butcher the goose for the big holiday dinner.

You're upset.

You loved the goose.  You loved all the crazy stuff the goose did in the story, you loved how he started out as a bad goose and redeemed himself and became a good goose by scaring away a small coyote from eating one of the lambs.

You now are really listening and are enthralled.

But, then in the last minutes of the story I tell you about how the pig farmer suddenly becomes a vegetarian because he choked on a chicken bone and he released the goose to join a flock of geese flying south for the winter.

The story ends.

You are really happy because you loved that goose and you start to cry with tears of joy as the goose flies off into the sunset with the other geese.

But, then it dawns on you . . . . . .

Hey, wait a minute !!!!

What about the pig farm, what about the pig pens, what about the crowded conditions, the pig farmer, the land commissioner ???

What about that crazy land surveyor who wouldn't leave the dog alone ????

is the freeway going to destroy the pig farm ???

Are holiday lights going to short out and burn down the house and kill all the people at the party ???

What about that damn baby duck !!!!!!

Yeah, you are glad the goose didn't die and it really was a beautiful ending with him flying off into the glorious sunset.

But, what about ALL the other stuff ????

You're pissed.  You're disappointed.  You're hurt.

You loved hearing about the Pig Farm, you loved hearing about the animals, you loved the suspense about Freeway, you actually enjoyed the fist fight because the pig farmer kicked the land commissioner's ass, you loved hearing about the upcoming Holiday Season.

But,

You feel like I was just telling you a bunch of stuff to keep you listening to me adding more and more twists and turns to the story...... and you still don't know what happened to all the stuff you really cared about.

You feel cheated.

If you haven't seen LOST and decide to buy the entire 6 disc set. . . . . after you finish watching all 6 seasons:

About 25% of you will feel that way.

About 25% will have loved the goose so much and it was such a beautiful ending, all other stuff won't matter in the slightest.

The remaining 50% will fall somewhere between the two.

Personally, I wouldn't spend the money for the Complete Collection because re-watching it won't be satisfying once you know the ending.

And, I'm still pissed because I don't know if that damed baby duck grew up and lived happily ever after.....at least until Duck Hunting Season.",1275350400,15,4729,4.3159090909090905

It's nice that so many people are happy and satisfied by both the series and its ending. Personally I feel silly for having invested so much time analysing  pointless fictional events, and  betrayed, after being repeatedly promised answers to the  crucial  mysteries.
Like many others, I have loved Lost and own all first five seasons. I was looking forward to watching all the episodes anew after the finale, savouring each clue within a logical imaginary universe.  Not so. The lame conclusion has ruined it. With a beautiful setting, big budget, great writers and superb actors, having set an end date and promised answers, the producers simply did not deliver.

Michael Emerson dropped by the G4's ""Attack of the Show"" this week and revealed that the ""Lost: The Complete Collection"" Blu-ray and DVD sets, coming to stores on August 24, will have more on Hurley and Ben Linus' story after where the series finale ended.

""Well, for those people that want to pony up and buy the Complete Lost Series, there is a bonus feature, which is, uhm, you could call it an epilogue, a lost scene,"" he said. ""It's a lot, it's 12 or 14 minutes that opens a window onto that gap of unknown time between Hurley becoming number one and the end of the series.""

Asked if that could lead to a spin-off series with Hurley and Ben Linus, he added, ""It's self-contained, although it's a rich period in the show's mythology that's never been explored, so who knows what will come of it.""",1274918400,11,825,4.443708609271523
4077503,3,B0036EH3WU,"I am also one of those who religiously watched every episode of Lost until the - sadly extremely bad - end of the show. I won't give it 1 star because that would not be true to the enjoyment I got of watching mystery after mystery unfold. But I also won't give it 5 stars because ultimately Lost turned out to be the equivalent of a bad fast food meal - enticing, but ultimately unsatisfying. So ""average"" seems to be the verdict of choice. Just ""average"". But it could have been great - ""could have been"" that is.

The ending of Lost must count as one of the worst and annoying ends to a series ever created in the history of TV. It is the ultimate cop-out of the creators of the show - showing us in thinly veiled form that they DID'NT know what they were inventing all the time, that they DID make it up on the spot, that they just dangled carrots in front of us all the time. To hide this fact they went for a shmaltzy ending that gives false ""closure"" to the characters (at least those that didn't ask for a paycheck too high, like Eko) and goes directly for the tear-ducts of viewers who have an idealized view of an afterlife fashioned after very conservative (and frankly, sorry to say that, very American - everybody else will have a good laugh) Christian views of it. The multi-denominational symbols in the church at the end don't hide the fact that this ""afterlife"" will only appeal to Christians with a very naive outlook on it - Buddhists would feel insulted if that was ""their"" afterlife for example.

The big mistake here is that the show was never about religion, it was about big, crazy mysteries and about characters. Yes, I, like anybody else, am interested in the characters and their fate, but I am definitely NOT interested in their afterlife (I am interested in their LIFE!), because I simply don't believe in an afterlife as tacky and corny like this. To think about that more than half of Season 6 was wasted with scenes that turned out to play out in Jack's mind before his death, and which could have been summed up in one scene that told us that he had a ""good"" death that was worthwhile - it just makes me very angry. A complete waste of time, treading water because nothing else was to say.

""Lost"" was a show about mysteries - there are mystery shows which let a lot of stuff unexplained, but actually even the unfinished ""Twin Peaks"" explained more than the finale of Lost. And ""Twin Peaks"" was a great show reveling in weirdness whereas Lost was always a mainstream show with very clear-cut storytelling. After seeing so many huge mysteries build up over the course of the show, like the numbers, the Dharma initiative, Jacob's cabin, Walt's and Miles' mysterious powers, the true nature of the island, etc. (the list could go on for ages,and for each of these mysteries complete strings of episodes were used to build them up, episodes that now seem like a complete waste of time in retrospect), having them not even a TINY BIT explained at the end is really like a punch in the face. It's like reading a traditional crime novel with 60.000 pages that builds up to the revelation of the murderer, and then it ends with a cooking recipe instead. It's like receiving a puzzle with 60.000 pieces and only finding out at the end that you only got half of the pieces.

Yes, it would have been in the nature of the show to leave some mysteries explained, in fact it would not have been good to explain EVERYTHING. But building up major plot points over the years to just leave them dangling is just something that so much reeks of bad storytelling that it just hurts.
Sorry, not convinced. File it under the ""Rambaldi"" - syndrome. Anybody remember ""Rambaldi"", a mystery central to the show ""Alias"" (another Abrams created show)? This mystery was used as the major plot-point for basically all episodes and was never explained as well.

What this world needs is another mystery show. A show that is carefully crafted and laid out for let's say 4-5 seasons, with engaging characters, satisfying arcs, etc., but with all developments already mapped out, as well as an explanation of them. Sadly this kind of show will never happen in the tv world as it is now, dependent on ratings etc.. ""Flash Forward"" could have been that show, but alas....

4077504,2,B0036EH3WU,"Unless ABC gives us two additional seasons to finish the series as it should be finished, don't bother. Just watch the first season (the strongest, anyway) and the finale. The rest is just tons and tons of questions of things that Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof thought would be cool and then never bothered to answer. The list of open questions and plotholes after watching the finale is mind-numbing. So, avoid watching hundreds of hours of TV for nothing. First season + Finale will tell you all you need to know, and all they managed to tell us.

4077505,1,B0036EH3WU,"I could have thought at least 5 different better endings to this show.

It was entertaining... But at the end, the show has proved to be no more than a cheap SOAP OPERA!

4077506,2,B0036EH3WU,"Watch the final episode of Lost, and pretend like it actually is what they made it into- a movie. Pretend that you have never seen it before, and you're settling down for an hour and forty-five minutes that you could spend watching any other movie.

The first thing you'd notice about this one is that you don't recognize any of the actors, besides that Hobbit and the Korean dude who plays small roles in a lot of stuff. This would cause you to groan, 'oh man, this is a straight to video movie.' You would then quickly notice that you were right: vague metaphors that go nowhere, cheesy themeless music, melodramatic caricature-characters, cheap sets, spineless dialogue.

Were the credits to be your magical memory-restoration moment, you would think about it in relation to the show in general. Where was Michael in this afterlife? Why was his son so special? Did people's actions really mean anything- like, some of them were murdering bastards. That's just ok? Was this light ultimately unassailable, or were they still at risk at the end?  The best episode of the series was Richard Alpert's story- what the hell happened with him?

At the end, there was no real character development, plot lines that they spent a lot of time on that either went nowhere or proved meaningless, and a rushed fizzle of a finale with 'the bad guy,' who wound up being a total wussy.

The point of this show was to give you a sense of transcendent meaning, without ever giving you any real substance. It felt all along like it had so much potential, but potential is all it ever was- it never had the writing goods to make that potential go anywhere. Every plot line that reluctantly resolved itself wound up doing so between 15-25 IQ points shy of what it felt like it should have.

My recommendation: if you've never seen Lost, watch the last episode first, and ask yourself: do I want to watch 6 long seasons leading up to THAT? Alternately, watch just the first season, write a list of the 5 most likely things you think are going on. Now cross off the 3 most intelligent, and cringe.

This show was a total waste of time.",1274832000,15,2113,4.588859416445623

4077508,5,B0036EH3WU,"Lost is a show that is totally about the characters, weaving excellent stories around characters that everyone will rally around - coming from a very WIDE variety of origins.

But what makes it so much different from other shows, it leaves you wondering, and while some may throw stones at loose ends, and Lost never really explaining itself, that sense of wonder, of feeling like you're on this fantastic island with polar bears and smoke monsters, wondering if the Others are right around the corner.  Even to the end of the series, there will still be loose ends - however, that's not to the show's detriment.

By the time you arrive at the end, hopefully you will see that it's the journey everyone went on, and not the loose ends, that is the true story of lost.  How a plane full of people can crash, survive, and endure adversity.  Lost is a show that will definitely change the face of American TV because it has such an emotional impact, and ends exactly how the writers wanted it to.  Lost is akin to a good novel, rather than a mindless television show, and one that will continue to let the users think, debate, and try to figure out stuff for years, if not decades, to come.

The short of it: This is going to become a Christmas present to my family members who like Lost, but don't have any of the existing seasons on DVD.",1274832000,10,1336,4.450819672131147

No, they had several loose ends and missteps but on the whole it was truly engaging and though-provoking science fiction, with characters I grew to care about. I probably cried 7 times during the finale.  With BSG passing on last year and now Lost, there is not much else to pique my interest on television. Time to move on and get a life I guess.",1274745600,9,468,4.2
4077520,2,B0036EH3WU,"...says the tagline for the Lost Complete Collection boxset.

NOT. EVEN. CLOSE.

**First off, this is a review of the show from a diehard Lost fan. Do you really want to hear about how thick the cardboard of the box is? How glossy the packaging is? If this is 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio? No. You want to know if this show is worth watching, and investing your time in devotion of understanding it.**

Well, read on...

DO NOT buy it if you appreciate shows that have a complete narrative and actually answer the majority of questions and plot lines that arise during the course of the story.

There better be one hell of a ""special features"" section that explains everything that the writers and producers purposely decided to leave out of the story. I would probably purchase this if it ever dropped between $80-100 for Blu-ray purely for reasons of nostalgia, but the show's creators perpetrated such a fraud and mind**** on their loyal viewers, that I'm not inclined to put a single penny in their pockets upon release.

The writers and producers are charlatans; flimflam men; the long-conmen of network television for all time.

Engaging, complex characters? Yes. For the most part. But who cares how engaging and interesting the characters are, how sympathetic or antagonist we are of them, or how clever the writing and dialogue is if you have no clue how to end it while satisfying the majority of your viewers, and resolving all of the issues you have created?

Don't write a show in one direction for four/five/six seasons, and then at the last possible moment, flip it 180 degrees to satisfy the common, unintelligent, unimaginative, unscientific, mouth-breathing masses.

To quote another poster from the DarkUFO website on his thoughts regarding the final episode of the series:

""A) How ""The End"" resolved the characters - 9/10 - it was beautiful, and moving, and I really enjoyed each scene as strangers realized their connection. The closing scenes were touching, if a bit hammy. [...]

B) How ""The End"" resolved the questions about the Island - 0/10 - it was awful, didn't answer anything, added even more questions without a straightforward answer, and was just horribly, horribly unsatisfying.""

Right on the money, my friend; which is why I score this series as two stars. The excellence of the other seasons, aside from six and the final episode, cannot detract from the hours of enjoyment and ""oh, snap!"" moments I experienced while watching. However, the final episode did so much to damage that legacy, that I cannot in good conscience recommend someone plunk down their hard-earned money on something that has a 50/50-plus chance of being a major disappointment.

Well-perpetrated cop out, Darlton. I'll avoid anything with your names on it like the plague from here on out. And Mr. Abrams, if it doesn't say ""Star Trek"" on it, I don't want anything you're peddling either.

Thanks for five relatively competent and imaginative seasons, followed by one steaming pile of one.",1274745600,21,2996,4.9186507936507935
4077521,3,B0036EH3WU,"Lost really dropped the ball in season 6. Having now seen the series through to completion, I among many was bitterly disappointed with the series finale. The current package art tagline, ""all the mysteries will be revealed"" does not ring true as the show's wrap up acrimoniously avoids answering the mysteries long established and left unexplained and instead cops out with an ending that fans themselves had actually bettered, in the ongoing speculation over the relevance of the ""sideways"" theme of the final season.

LOST is far from a perfect show. Like many, its first season is largely considered to be its strongest and from an accessibility point, this is true. Season 2 begins to wane in quality of the story with unnecessary flashbacks which reiterate the first season stories, and superfluous storylines like Sawyer and Hurley's quest for a noise-making treefrog.

Season 3 sees the show begin to rev up again, with a far more balanced year of revelation vs filler and finally, a packed season finale with genuine ""WTF!"" moments...

Season 4 and 5 I consider to be the best of the show. Season 4 establishes flashing forward rather than back to characters' lives, and the introduction of compelling new characters on the island including Faraday, Charlotte and Miles. Season 5 continues the brilliance of 4 but ups the ante now crossing time and space itself, with the ensemble cast divided in completely separate positions. This year features the show's 100th episode, and the remaining episodes rev up to the last annoyingly brilliant cliffhanger.

So we come to season 6. The heights of the last 2 years and elaboration of the mythology, coupled with regularly returning plot holes like Walt and DHARMA led me to have huge expectations. Yet sadly, LOST season 6 suffers from what you might call ""trilogy-itus"" so common in film series' as the last part cannot match the brilliance of what came before. Conclusions, when offered, are more logical and predictable than outstanding and the series mostly suffers from three different groups of people sitting around while not actually doing anything significant.

The ending encourages you to accept their denial of answering questions, of it being irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. But it doesn't sell after 6 years of waiting for the mysteries to make sense. Up to a point, Lost is an incredibly intelligent show, that for a time demanded complete concentration and recollection on behalf of its captive audience.
But 'The End' doesn't deliver, and fans are left emotionally rewarded with cheap reunions, but intellectually disappointed. The real hook of the show is itself 'lost' along the way.",1274745600,25,2666,5.077625570776256
4077522,5,B0036EH3WU,"I bought the 5 season set earlier this year and it is great to watch the second time around.  you get even more seeing it wide-screen and with all the fantastic bonuses.  That being said, I didn't get a box.  And I want a box! So I hope the DD producers are listening!  Throw in a free box for everyone who buys the final season DVD's.  (It would also encourage anyone just buying the final season to go back and get the rest to fill the big box up!)  We want a big box just like the one that houses all 6 seasons. Because most of your fans already own the first five seasons and we will all need that box. Or charge us $3.99 for the box separately, and we will all likely buy it when we go to get the sixth season DVD's!  Set a standard for releasing the final season and a box to put them all in and your fans will love you even more than they already do!  Don't make us send the smoke monster after you!

4077523,5,B0036EH3WU,"A lot of people are going to debate back and forth about this finale, the final year and whether or not it turns this elaborate performance piece into a show worth it's place in the history of great storytelling or a complete waste of time.  Were enough questions answered?  Did we find out everything we need to know?  Why was Walt so important?  Where did the Dharma pallets keep coming from?  Who was Libbie's husband and how did he die?  Why was she in the mental institution?
Who cares?
Although the mysteries were tantalizing, Lost wasn't merely a show about devises and red herrings.  It was about people.  The Variables.  How they affect us and how they change everything that we thought our life should be.  It was about destiny and free will and how the two are not exclusive.  It's about how a world is only worth saving if there is love within it.  Though the story is told through Jack Shephard's rise, fall and redemption, it is truly a tale of community.  And it is only with that community that we are really able to transcend ourselves too an enlightenment none of us could ever know alone.  It is only with each other that Jack and Locke become one full man.  With each other Sawyer and Juliet are able to lower their armor.  Hurley and Ben protect the island.  Claire and Kate raise Aaron.
The characters and their enlightenment was the focus of the writers, actors and all involved.  That is what made Lost great.  That is what made the mysteries so compelling.  And that Is why i will often revisit this show.  It was a gift.",1274659200,222,1546,4.469534050179211
4077524,4,B0036EH3WU,"It's a vast mass of mysteries, bizarre twists and supernatural occurrences -- and it's brilliant. ""Lost: The Complete Series"" has some bumps along its way (particularly in the second season), but it blossoms once it finds its footing, and starts working towards a brain-bending, epic clash between the forces of light and darkness. Think of it as ""Swiss Family Robinson"" by way of Stephen King.

A plane crashes on a remote tropical island, leaving a terrified band of survivors including a doctor named Jack (Matthew Fox), a spoiled brother and sister, a single dad and his strange son, an Iraqi ex-soldier, a Korean couple, chubby lottery winner, an escaped prisoner, a hostile con-man, a man cured of paralysis, and a junkie rocker.

Unfortunately, the island has countless perils that crop up as the survivors try to survive there, and strange people are hidden in its depths. What's more, the island has a history that stretches back countless years -- there are remnants of a powerful organization called Dharma, a collection of ""Others"" living in a luxurious modern village, a metal hatch with a button that MUST be pushed, and ancient statues and temples from ancient times.

The survivors do their best to keep alive and to fight back the Others, but they lose many of their number as they struggle to survive. And when a small band of them do escape the island, they find that they have somehow disrupted the island's primal forces, and even the fabric of time itself. But even when they fight their way back to the island, they find that not all is as it should be. In an effort to set things right, they must take the ultimate risk... or the evil force imprisoned on the island will destroy them all.

Yes, it's a weird show -- ""Lost"" might make more sense if you're drunk or stoned, because it can swing wildly from the downright surreal to the mundane. But in the midst of shallow sitcoms and endless reality TV, it's refreshing to see a twisty-turny show like this one -- religious symbolism, horror, science fiction, and a mythic storyline that stretches through the centuries.

The lush landscape is a contrast for such a dark storyline, although the writers do stumble occasionally (the first half of the second season is a total misfire). Adams never reveals everything, which keeps up the suspense, and he twines together dozens of mysteries -- the island's nature, its prior inhabitants, and its countless mysteries. Every time Adams unravels one puzzle, it just reveals a new one -- and while he fails to answer all the mysteries (Walt and the animals!), the answers to the main ones are truly spellbinding.

And ""Lost"" is truly an ensemble show -- every character gets to shine (including some we don't care about), and flashbacks (and flash-forwards) reveal what makes them tick. Some like Jin, Sun and the haunted, smart-alecky Sawyer evolve into whole new people.

Matthew Fox is given a lot of attention, and he is a good actor... even though the self-righteous Jack eventually gets kind of annoying. Fortunately, there's a brilliant supporting cast -- Dominic Monaghan, Jorge Garcia (""Dude, that was a Jedi moment!""), Terry O'Quinn, Evangeline Lilly, the brilliant Naveen Andrews and Josh Holloway, Yunjin Kim, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Daniel Dae Kim. Michael Emerson is awesome as the creepy-eyed Other leader, as is Henry Ian Cusick as ex-soldier/monk Desmond.

""Lost"" is a well-written, well-acted show that brings a bit of mystery back into prime-time television. Creepy, funny, romantic, tragic and sometimes just weird.",1274572800,,3552,4.968013468013468

I have spent hours watching people on youtube talk about their Lost Theories and researching obscure facts on Lostepedia, DarkUFO or countless other Lost sites.
