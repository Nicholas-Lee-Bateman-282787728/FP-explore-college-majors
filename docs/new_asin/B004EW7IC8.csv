8427657,2,B004EW7IC8,"Several years back, I was fortunate to have seen a few different trailers or short clips of Gilman's odyssey and enjoyed them. It was after showing a friend recently that I decided to look this full-length film up on Amazon. I didn't like it as much as the trailers which showed the highlights. Additionally, one trailer showed several orcas floating right next to their boat as Paul played. This dvd didn't include that footage.",1385942400,,429,4.8108108108108105
