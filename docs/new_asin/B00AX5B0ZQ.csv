8558736,4,B00AX5B0ZQ,Best picture quality that I've found for these three Bob Hope films.  Hate the cheesy tin box that it comes in.  Disc two is labeled disc three (probably pulled from the larger Hope set bearing the same cover art).,1478304000,,214,4.461538461538462
8558737,4,B00AX5B0ZQ,"Great Bob Hope movies, sans Bing Crosby. Nice quality prints obtained by Shout.  Bought principally for charming ""Lemon Drop Kid"".  The tin packaging is bulky, storing and removing the DVDs was awkward.  To save space I removed DVDs and put them in a slim Amaray double case, scanning the can to make an identifying product insert.  Discarded bulky tin can.",1454889600,,357,4.9
