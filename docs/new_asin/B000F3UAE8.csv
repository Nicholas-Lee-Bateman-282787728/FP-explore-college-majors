2550568,5,B000F3UAE8,This season is not as good as the first two seasons but is noteworthy. I wish there were more episodes dealing with the Armageddon stuff though.,1147910400,4,144,4.576923076923077
2550569,2,B000F3UAE8,"The first two seasons of ""The Dead Zone"" were terrific; the third season was uneven, but still pretty good.  However, with the fourth season, the series seems to have descended into tedium.  The writers don't seem to have any real interest in going anywhere with the Stillson/Armageddon story arc -- though there are several episodes that deal with that storyline, they do very little to advance it.  At the same time, almost all of the stand-alone episodes are poorly conceived, poorly written, and even -- I was shocked by this -- poorly acted.  Anthony Michael Hall, who was so deeply excellent on this show's first three seasons, seems in many of these episodes to be playing Johnny as a comic figure, whereas by all rights, he ought to be turning into an almost tragic figure.

Want proof?  Check out ""A Very Dead Zone Christmas,"" which is not merely a bad episode of ""The Dead Zone"" . . . it is probably one of the worst hours of television I have ever seen.  Unredeemably, unbelievably awful, and it could not be further in tone from the rest of the series.  Whoever thought this episode would be a good idea ought to have their paycheck taken away.

On the other hand, there's ""Double Vision,"" co-starring the excellent Jennifer Finnigan as a psychic whom Johnny bumps into.  This is a very good episode, but it is not enough to redeem a thoroughly lousy seasons.

Buy it if you're a completist, like me.  Otherwise, you may be very disappointed.",1147478400,21,1454,4.658823529411765
2550570,5,B000F3UAE8,"Johnny Smith completely twists whatever you were expecting to happen in season four upside down.  Christopher Wey, Johnny's counterpart in the post-armageddon world, brings Johnny face to face with his future self.  He learns armageddon will still happen if he maintains his present course.

2550572,5,B000F3UAE8,"I'm not sure why I didn't realize the low amount of episodes per season... but if you get this at a decent price it is totally worth it.  I got sucked into every single episode and completely lost track of time.  It's a terrific show that is sure to keep most people entertained.  I am already working on getting the entire series for my Mom who used to watch this when it first came out.  She takes it to watch with my Grandparents which love it as well!

2550585,5,B000F3UAE8,I have watched this series before and loved it but sadly missed the end so I decided to buy the series to catch up on old memories. It didn't disappoint a bit. It came quite in one pack and was delivered real fast in real good shape. For all that like a kind of mystery show with a entertaining story and a good character play then I would advise you to buy these series. I find it remarkable how Johnny uses his abilitys to help others. Will Johnny though be able to save the future of many people? If you want to know I would buy the series now :D. I know that was mean of me but hes worth it.,1388188800,,595,3.925619834710744

2550587,5,B000F3UAE8,"Great show starring Michael Anthony Hall as always, but the difference this season is the change in the music for the opening credits.  It's not the haunting song we originally heard but an insipid instrumental tune that doesn't stick in the brain at all.  You don't know what show you're watching at all.  The music is a disappointment, thank goodness the characters and the writing are still good.",1373760000,,399,4.838235294117647
2550588,5,B000F3UAE8,this is a great series and love it heaps.  Thanks amazon for the excellent quality it is hard to find sometimes to get older movies or series in such excellent condtion,1368576000,,168,4.419354838709677
2550589,4,B000F3UAE8,"I love this series. It has everything that makes a series good. Action, adventure, and dead people. The main storyline of his dealing with the end of the world is compelling.",1366243200,,174,4.645161290322581

2550591,3,B000F3UAE8,"While this series does not capture the haunting feeling of dread that permeates the Dead Zone feature film, and Anthony Michael Hall is no Christopher Walken, it is nonetheless a good fluffy sci-fi watch.  I enjoyed the whole series but one season does not stick out more than another.  In fact, while an enjoyable ride, it's not a memorable series in total.",1271116800,,358,4.758064516129032
2550592,1,B000F3UAE8,"I enjoyed this series for the first 3 seasons.  Some of the acting and character writing was a bit weak, but the sci-fi ideas surrounding Johnny's psychic powers were interesting and well-executed.  The first episode of this season has to be watched, and was probably mostly written and maybe even filmed along with the prior season.

***Spoiler Alert

After that, the Dead Zone goes downhill fast.  When Johnny threw away his cane, the writers threw away the interesting future-feedback device and slacked off that whole storyline.  When he and Rebecca threw each other and their relationship away, without reason or motivation, the writers threw away all respect for the audience's intelligence.

After that, the show becomes a shallow anecdote of the week affair, and the writing keeps getting dumber.  An interesting new psychic love interest develops, and they throw that away too.  How can I get on board with a world where people are walking away from potential dream lovers without any explanation, presumably to go live by themselves in a hotel somewhere?  This is a world where people just trash amazing opportunities every day... just because?

***End Spoiler

My impression is that some drastic change happened with the production and/or writing.  The character writing wasn't that great in the first 3 seasons, but at least the series had the balls to try challenging serial story lines.  Starting here, the series becomes the kind of lame, intelligence-insulting commercial TV show that I try hard to avoid.",1265760000,3,1521,5.130081300813008

2550594,4,B000F3UAE8,"We've watched the previous three seasons of THE DEAD ZONE in quick succession, and generally enjoyed every episode. The fourth season is darker in content with more standalone episodes. The Stillson and Purdy backstory is only seen now and then. ""Heroes and Demons"" is probably the best episode from season 4. Still good viewing but we no longer feel compelled to watch without a break, as we did while watching seasons 1 and 2.",1254700800,,428,4.797297297297297
2550595,4,B000F3UAE8,"this is a great series, too bad it ended without anyone knowing it was going to end as soon as it did after 6 successful season runs.",1245456000,,133,3.962962962962963
2550596,5,B000F3UAE8,I've become very fond of the series and I watch every episode with delight.  I enjoyed this fourth season as much as the others.  Right now I'm watching the fifth season and probably I'll end watching the final season in the following weeks.

2550598,4,B000F3UAE8,"I bought this series soon after it came out, but am just watching it now.  It seems whoever manufactured this season's DVD set goofed. When you go to Select Episode (which is what I always do, since I watch one here and there).  The list of available episodes is only TWO (although there are FOUR on the DVD).  I can see absolutely no way to access the other two episodes unless I go to PLAY ALL and then fast forward (which might not work on all DVD players) to the episode I wish to view.  It's really inconvenient.  I just thought I'd warn you.  But yes - I'd still buy it - I enjoy The Dead Zone episodes, although I like the ""threads"" to surface in the stories more frequently.",1214870400,,682,4.207692307692308
2550599,4,B000F3UAE8,"OK not everybody is a dead zone fan. I am. I don't like the relationship between Johnny and Sarah. I grow weary of the Stilson storyline and especially the X-Files treatment of it. I guess the writers can go there whenever their creativity takes a break. That said I really liked season 4. Johnny meets a girl psychic, a good episode, and it closes with a bonus Christmas Episode that is my ALL TIME favorite episode of Dead Zone. This season is worth it for any Dead Zone fan, and is a MUST for a serious fan.",1209859200,,510,4.268041237113402

I would recommend this, and all seasons of The Dead Zone, to anyone who likes sci fi action/dramas such as X-Files, Lost, Heroes, etc.",1176336000,,377,4.815384615384615
2550605,4,B000F3UAE8,"Wow, I have all the 4 Seasons of Dead Zone and the suspance and the stories are always well done and rich of suspance. After 4 years I can say the episodes are always at high level, well built and characters and life around John Smith are realistic.

I really enjoy watching this DVD.

Just one thing...there are no subtitle so it can be difficolt to understand all the words, but that's because I'm italian. I remember there were subtitle on the 1 season only.",1175558400,2,461,4.411764705882353

2550610,5,B000F3UAE8,"The Dead Zone is still one of the best shows on tv, and while I agree with some of the other posts, the Stillson story arc was handled, well, strangely.

As for the DVD's the box reads ""Closed Captioned"" as a feature. Sadly they are not. Hopefully USA knows about this, and will remedy the situation.",1157846400,2,300,4.357142857142857
2550611,3,B000F3UAE8,"I'm not sure why only 3 episodes of this season were committed to the ongoing storyline of Greg Stillson (Sean Patrick Flannery), but that was a mistake. The remainder of the stories are pure escapism; entertaining, but no more so than any other TV show. The writers need to do a better job tying individual episodes to the real story.

One of the best reoccuring themes from seasons 2 and 3 was the appearance of Frank Whaley (futureman) and of Johny's future self. They ended this story with Johny's impromptu tossing of his cane into a river. In effect, the writers threw away a formula that was working in favor of a purely mediocre series of fill-in episodes.

The Dead Zone is nearing it's last gasp and there doesn't appear to be any sign of recovery. The introduction of some evil cabal behind Stillson and Rev Purdie only fuels the derailment. They need to go back to basics and focus on the true storyline of the Dead Zone without overly complicating it.",1156204800,16,964,4.598837209302325

I RECOMMEND DEAD ZONE HIGHLY.",1154304000,4,277,4.148148148148148
2550614,4,B000F3UAE8,"Before I saw this 4th Season of Dead Zone, I read reviews from Amazon. Many panned dear Johnny's Season.

So I went into the season with low expectations. Funny thing was...I was entertained just like always. Of course, some of the storylines were far-fetched. The whole concept of Dead Zone is brilliantly far-fetched (thank you Stephen King). Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the viewing.",1153094400,3,385,5.111111111111111
2550615,4,B000F3UAE8,"I just started watching The Dead Zone on dvd because I don't have cable, I recently picked up all four seasons and watched them all in two weeks. While season four may not have been the best season it advances the mythology of the series, and ep. 11, the season finale was excellent. Anthony Michael Hall is excellent as Johnny Smith and he has great chemstry with his co-stars especially John Adams who plays his friend Bruce. I can't wait till I get season five. There has been rumours that season 5 will be the last season, I hope this is not true. Season four is definitely a must buy for DZ fans, the only problem is that season 4 does not have as many extras as the other seasons.",1153008000,6,686,4.2846153846153845
2550616,3,B000F3UAE8,"I agree with the previous reviewers that the fourth season of The Dead Zone is not as great as the previous three.  I'd even say that things began to fall apart at the end of the third season.  Maybe that is why the 4th season was short.  They realized it wasn't going anywhere good, so they ended it early.  I absolutely fell in love with The Dead Zone (and Anthony Michael Hall) during the first two seasons.  The stories were clever, well written and well acted.  The story line, in my opinion, began to slip when they introduced the Greg Stilson story arc.  I think there may be some confusion on the part  of the production as to how to end that story.  If you've read the book, you know that things end badly for Johnny because he tries to change the outcome of his visions of Greg Stilson.  So, as a fan of the clever series I first became enamored with, I was completely ticked to see Greg Stilson even come into play.  Maybe the writers, producers, etc. are trying to hash out a way that things don't end so badly and therefore end the series.  I'll probably still buy this set just for the sake of keeping my set complete, but I won't watch it nearly as much as the first two seasons.",1151452800,5,1194,4.257777777777778
2550617,4,B000F3UAE8,"I do not consider it to be a good sign that after having enjoyed commentary tracks on every third season episode of ""The Dead Zone,"" that there are only a pair of commentary tracks to be found on the DVDs for the fourth season.  I watched the fourth season right before the premier of the show's fifth season on the USA network, so I was easily struck by the way the show ended up where it started, with the love interest of Johnny Smith (Anthony Michael Hall) paying the price for being involved with a psychic.  At the start of season four we are talking about Rebecca Caldwell (Sarah Wynter), who wants to (finally) blow away Greg Stillson (Sean Patrick Flanery) for killing her sister Rachel, while at the end it is now Miranda Ellis (Laura Harris), the daughter of Senator Harlan Ellis (Don S. Davis), and Stillson's unwilling fiance.  By now it is clear that the Stillson question is not going to be resolved until the final episode of the series, and so that plot line is going to get strung out until the very end.  There are a few episodes that move things along slowly, such as when Johnny's brightest former student invents something that fits into Armageddon (""Vanguard""), and as Rev. Purdy (David Ogden Stiers) experiences some problems with his ministry (""Saved"").

Most of the season is devoted to individual cases with the main difference that being that while Johnny Smith is not a household name there are a lot of people who know who he is and believe in his powers so that he does not have to prove it time and time again (although somebody finally does ask him why he does not use his powers to get the winning lottery number).  This creates a slightly different dynamic from the first couple of seasons of the show.  Another key factor is that there is no longer an attempt to work the entire supporting cast into each and every episode.  Consequently, one week Johnny is dealing with Walt Bannerman (Chris Bruno) and Sarah (Nicole de Boer), and the next they are not around and Johnny is teamed up with Bruce Lewis (John L. Adams) again.  Sarah shows up the least, and only if she is central to the plot, as when a friend disappears (""The Collector""), Johnny finds out her favorite rock star faked his death (""The Last Goodbye""), or she visits her father (""Coming Home"").  We even get to find out some things about Johnny's father that prove to be of interest (""Babble On""), but I find it somewhat surprising that they are not doing more about Johnny's son now that the truth is known.  The title sequence makes a big deal about the life Johnny has lost, but by the fourth season that really does not matter all that much anymore.

The most interesting character from the season is Alex Sinclair (Jennifer Finnigan), another psychic, who runs into Johnny in ""Double Vision"" and comes back for the season finale ""A Very Dead Zone Christmas.""  Her powers are slightly different so when a vision pops up there is often a question as to whether it is her or him, but what makes the relationship fun is that even though they are attracted to each other they know this would never, ever work, and still manage to have some fun, especially when there is an amnesiac Santa involved.  As always, the ways they come up with new and interesting ways to represent Johnny's visions , and in ""Grains of Sand,"" where Johnny insists on taking care of the baby of an immigrant woman who dies, the visions get mixed up with daydreams.  So they keep on finding ways of making things visually interesting, even if the stories keep having to come up with obstacles to make it more difficult to Johnny to save the day.  ""The Dead Zone"" remains an interesting show (and USA has great promos involving Johnny Smith, Monk and the new guy from ""Psych""), but it not quite as good as it was early on.  But I am going to stick around until Stillson finally goes down for good.",1151366400,5,3870,4.537356321839081
2550618,5,B000F3UAE8,"Honestly, this season has its share of high and low points.

""Broken Circle"" gives the viewer a sense of closure to the third season. ""The Collector"" gives provides an expected twist to an ending.

Although some regard ""Second Sight"" as the high point of the season, I was not sold on this episode. The addition of a second psychic cheapened Jonnn's powers in my mind, but I suppose it depends on one's point of view.

Moving on, ""Still Life"" and ""Grains of Sands"" are neither stellar nor deplorable. Average at best.

I thoroughly enjoyed ""Vanguard"", and ""Heroes and Demons"" was a stand out episode. An austic kid helping Johnny? Good stuff.

""Babble On"", though, is one splendid piece of writing.

While the fourth season did not further the Armageddon Saga all that much, it enhanced the show's character backgrounds and personalities. Unique plots? You bet!",1150675200,4,861,4.903448275862069
2550619,3,B000F3UAE8,"ive seen all of the following espisodes, looking forward

when the fourth season started, but it was just ok with me.

i loved the first two, three was ok.i didn't like where some of the storylines were going.i think Anthony Michael Hall, is a great actor, and could probably have his pick of any movie, tv

show or whatever, and he will do well.i think the show will

be cancelled anyway. AMH is such a fine actor, like i said.

i would have liked to see Sara leave her husband and marry

Johnny but at the same time, i think the psychic girl in the

fourth season has better compatability with him.

i think the whole Stillson thing is dumb.whatever happens with the show i think AMH will be ok.im still thinking whether or not to bother to get the dvd, maybe for some extras.",1150070400,3,778,4.317241379310345

8116968,1,B000F3UAE8,"On May 18, 2017, I purchased The Dead Zone Season Four. There are 3 Disks. Each disk has what episodes are included on the disks. On each of  the disks 2 episodes are missing. Disk 1: Double Vision and Still Life are missing. Disk 2 Grains of Sand and Vanguard are missing. On Disk 3 Not Saved and A Very Dead Zone Christmas are missing. Disk 1 has Broken Circle and The Collector. Disk 2 has Double Vision and Still Life. Disk 3 has Babble On and Coming Home. The disks must be knock-offs. DO NOT PURCHASE. I'M RETURNING THE REJECTS!!!",1495497600,,536,4.306930693069307
8116969,4,B000F3UAE8,"Interesting how difficult some shows make it to select an episode. I was a programmer and this had rte worst menus I've ever seen.  Read the comments, they keep talking about how there are not enough episodes. That's because nobody knows how to get to half of the episodes from the episode selection menu.

For example it shows episode five and six on the episode selection screen. Below it says ""main menu"" with a right arrow. If you select ""main menu"", it takes you there, back one menu.

To get to episode 7 & 8, Tab down to main menu and hit the right arrow on your remote.",1491696000,,577,4.324074074074074
