7973259,1,B00006SKVF,Do not throw your money into the Amazon river! This movie is useless and it's not the one you're looking for. This is a pal system recording and a fake version of the original British robin hood. I don't understand why these donkeys selling this DVD in USA if it does not support USA format? Although I converted the movie to US format but in some chapters language changes to French and some in Spanish. Loads of problems with this DVD.,1272758400,,437,4.407407407407407
7973260,5,B00006SKVF,"I've been watching these series since I was a child, and the amazing story line coupled with the haunting melodies of Clannad really make watching them a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I highly recommand finding the complete set which ranges from the first four dvd's with Michael Pryed to the later ones with Jason Connery. Although you cannot find them in a playable US region coding, you can however find them in the European coding which will play a PAL DVD player...or XBox if you happen to own one.

However you decide to do it, they are wonderful, and for those that loved Robin Hood they are not to be missed.",1164326400,,617,4.660550458715596
