She gives you practical advice about purchasing museum passes and avoiding the lines. She also visited the iconic sites like the Colosseum, Pantheon, and Spanish Steps. However, I felt like she simply went from museum to museum. With the exception of one time when she got a gelato, she didn't show us any restaurants. She hardly interacted with the locals. I didn't get a sense of the local culture. If I just wanted a list of museums in Rome, I could Google that. I literally fell asleep watching this. It's good to give the viewers practical information but a host should also try to impart the local culture. Rick Steves is a better tour guide.",1412380800,4,745,4.525925925925926
8429463,5,B004HD60L4,"This brought back many memories of a trip I took with my younger daughter and niece several years ago. The guide went to more places than we were able. Since the city is so old, some of the streets are not foot friendly-- nor are all the stairs.  We stayed one block from the Spanish steps and the city is absolutely breath taking. We took the bus around town and saw a lot of sights we were not able to visit because of time restraints. I bought this video as a gift for a friend who is wanting to visit Rome. She will love it.",1373587200,5,528,4.0285714285714285
