2939925,5,B000VECAEE,"To Those Who Have NEVER Bought Single TV Season DVDs Before - THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME!
To Those Who HAVE Bought Single TV Season DVDs Before - THIS HAPPENS EVERY TIME!
Yes...Time/Life Got It Right By Releasing ""Get Smart"" Not Only As Individual Seasons, But As An Awesome Box Set Of All Five Seasons. They Gave Us The Choice Up Front.
True...Twentieth Century Fox Released ""M*A*S*H: Goodbye, Farewell And Amen "" As A 3-Disc Edition With The Extras That Were Previously Only Available In The ""Complete Series"" Box Set.
THIS IS STILL SEINFELD! AND IS ONE OF THE BEST SIT-COMS EVER! (Very Much Inspired By Abbott And Costello's Original Sit-Com)
So, With This Complete Series Set You Get A Book Of Pictures With Some Additional Scribbled Comments. So, With This Complete Series Set You Get A DVD Of The Complete ""Round Table"" Discussion (Yadda, Yadda, Yadda).
To Those Who Bought The Individual Season DVDs And Complain About Missing Out On These Extras, All I Have To Say Is...
There Are No ""The Big Salad"" Script Or Monk's Diner Salt And Pepper Shakers (As Released With The Seasons 1-3 Box Set).
There Is No ""Mini Puffy Shirt In A Plastic Case"" (As Released With The Seasons 5-6 Box Set).
I Would Not Trade These Gems For Any Picture Book Or More Talk About The Series On DVD! (Highlights Of This DVD Are Included On The Season 9 Set)
Maybe Sony Will Follow Fox And Release The Final Seinfeld Episode Separately With All The New Extras.
If Not, We All Have A Choice - Wait YEARS For A Series Box Set (And Miss Out On All The Individual Extras To Get The Final Extras) Or Buy The Individual Seasons As They Are Released.
My True Hope Is That Every Company Follows Time/Life And Releases The Entire Series Of A TV Show Along With The Individual Seasons At The Same Time! (Give Us The Choice!)
I Personally Have Pre-Ordered The 9th Season Separately (Having Already Purchased The Previous Seasons) And Will Not Buy This Complete Set. (Not That There's Anything Wrong With That)
All Said, Please DO NOT Give This Set A Low Rating Because You Didn't Know This Would be Released.
IT'S SEINFELD! IT DESERVERS FIVE STARS NO MATTER WHAT!",1192060800,31,2128,4.632275132275132
2939926,5,B000VECAEE,"I, for one, cannot wait for this box set to come out; and to those who are complaining, I don't believe you are honestly surprised by this...they ALWAYS release a big box set with every season and a crap load of extra stuff. It never fails. And you'll buy it, and you'll love it; because it's Seinfeld, and it rocks.",1191283200,4,316,4.283333333333333
2939927,5,B000VECAEE,"c'mon now, you knew this was going to happen. The very moment season one was released you knew there was a very good chance they'd package the complete series at a later date, and I'm very happy they did. Seinfeld was a great show.

Sure, I bought a few of the individual seasons, and I'm going to buy the complete series set too, just so I can have all of them together, nice and neat. What's wrong with giving consumers more options? It would have been nice if the complete series was available for purchase when season one was released, but you know that wasn't going to happen.

I imagine they'll make more money this way, releasing each season one at a time, but to think this was some evil plan purposely kept hidden to everyone is nuts.

Again, Seinfeld was a great show. Either buy each season one at a time or the complete series ... but either way, you'll enjoy them.",1191196800,6,877,4.368098159509202
2939928,3,B000VECAEE,"Agree with the other reviewers. I have purch the 1st 5 seasons of Seinfeld, 8 of King of Queens and 8 of Raymond. Now lo and behold all of them come in one neat little package.  Same thing happened to me with Friends!  Live and learn.  You've got to hand it to the studios though, they know the true fan and collector will get the individual seasons and then will also have to have the ultimate, complete box set, like myself.  I will probably wind up selling the individual seasons either at a yard sale or ebay, take my lumps on the price and then use that to purchase the all in one set!..

Luckily, there are no more series that I truly enjoy any more worth purchasing and if there was, i would certainly wait for the end to make the one purchase.
The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is because of the fact this product comes out now after all the single seasons. Just frustration and not a comment on the show itself",1190073600,8,926,4.179775280898877
2939929,5,B000VECAEE,"To me, Seinfeld can basically be broken into three parts - seasons one and two where the series is just finding itself, seasons three through seven in which absolutely everything clicks due to the cast's great on-screen rapport and the genius of Larry David, and the last two seasons after Larry David's departure in which the focus shifted somewhat from a satirical look at the uglier side of human nature to zany comedy. Usually every episode was a stand-alone. In fact, some of the early episodes are so stand-alone as to have the audience wonder what happened. In season two's ""The Deal"", Elaine and Jerry decide to try combining their current friendship (""this"") with their past by sleeping together (""that""). As George portends though, it is pretty much impossible to mix ""this and that"" without eventually losing both. The end of the episode shows Jerry and Elaine pretty much settling into ""this that and the other"" - a romantic relationship - and then the series just drops the subject like the whole episode never happened.

Occasionally Seinfeld would have a story arc of sorts. For example, in season four the show poked fun at network television executives and their decision-making process when George and Jerry wind up pitching the idea for ""a TV show about nothing"" to NBC. The two offer up what is essentially the script of the widely acclaimed Seinfeld episode ""The Chinese Restaurant"". The network suits are unimpressed. As an alternative George and Jerry present a ridiculous plot in which a judge sentences someone who has hit Jerry's car to be his butler. This time the suits are bowled over. Seinfeld also truly had a gift for entertaining while pushing the audience to the brink of offense. ""The Bubble Boy"" presents the audience with a rude and obnoxious individual as the victim of an immune deficiency disease versus the patient angels that usually play this role. ""The Outing"" introduced the phrase ""not that there's anything wrong with that"" into American pop culture and also smartly satirized political correctness. ""The Junior Mint"" shows George in familiar form when he pleads with Jerry not to intervene to save an artist's life because it would devalue the artist's paintings he has purchased in anticipation of that same artist's death.

The show is often absurd, and though it seems impossible that such a group of self-absorbed people could carry on even the pretense of a multi-year friendship, something about it is oddly familiar to most of us. That is at least partly because of the great interaction between the main characters in which they have both comic and straight-man duties depending on the situation, making their relationships seem real although exaggerated.

As far as the details on the set, it is a 32-disc, two-volume set offering all 180 episodes of the show along with ""The Official Coffee Table Book,"" a 226-page, bound anthology filled with photos, quotes, trivia from every episode, and personal reflections from Jerry. The collectible book also includes a bonus disc featuring ""The Roundtable,"" an hour-long round table discussion among the four cast and creator Larry David reminiscing about the award-winning show's run on air.",1188000000,373,3192,5.053130929791271
2939960,5,B000VECAEE,This should be in everyone's library. Great series and a great collection,1465171200,,73,5.166666666666667
2939961,3,B000VECAEE,"I never saw this show when it was first broadcast. I bought the DVD set because so many people told me how great the show is. While I find this show to be entertaining and watchable, I don't think it is anywhere near the ""best"" show of any time. By any stretch. I wouldn't want to know  any of these characters... they're mostly obnoxious self-absorbed jerks. The bass guitar ""soundtrack"" complete with lip smacks and pops is a vile, obnoxious, distracting assault on my ears as I watch. This show is nowhere near as bad as that festering garbage pile ""Two and a Half Men"", but it pretty overrated IMO. The worst part is  that GD bass guitar.  It's amazing how bad shows today suck where something like this is considered the ""best"".  Mundane writing, the same boring situations episode after episode, obnoxious soundtrack, a cast I'm glad I don't know...  So many classic shows are so much better. And funnier. The only thing this one did it tell the same joke for a decade.

Watchable, entertaining, sometimes funny, but mundane repetitive situations and obnoxious one-dimensional characters and irritating soundtrack. Let's say three and a half stars.

Edit:  I'm up to season 7. The soundtrack ruins the show for me. The characters don't grow or change, they just go from one obnoxious situation to the next. Is this fiasco going to manifest itself as  a bad dream Jerry had after eating bad shrimp? Only time will tell. It's no surprise to me that the great unwashed consider this ""clever"""". Sure it's clever. Clever like south park. Humor for the perpetual man-child and the air conditioner maintenance workers of the world.",1463184000,,1630,4.792857142857143

2940033,5,B000VECAEE,"Seinfeld is a great point of reference to use when trying to explain the mannerisms of people in the northeastern United States to anyone who is from, or has spent most of their life in, California, Colorado, or pretty much any of the western states.

For example, Kramer doesn't knock on Jerry's door.  He just walks in.  George and Elaine just show up.  If you tried to pull that kind of stuff on your ""friends"" in a western state, chances are, they would disown you.  Out here, (I speak of Colorado), they find it rude.

I like this series because, both sadly and hilariously, it is reminiscent of how life is ""back home""... and I still hate New Jersey.

2940036,5,B000VECAEE,"I have seen each episode (except the finale, which I'm saving for my death bed) at least 40 or 50 times each. After all this time, I still find the show just as funny as I did the first time I saw them.
When I watch shows like That 70s Show or Cheers, they seem so dated. Not only that, but the storylines seem a little played out after seeing the episode a couple times over. This is not the case with Seinfeld. This is the finest example of television as art. It seems like it was fate that brought the minds of Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld together. They covered every aspect of everyday life and portrayed it in a way that solidified the show's place in American culture.
No other show has attained the advanced level of comedy of Seinfeld. Most other shows relied on mindless slapstick that ""pushed the envelope"" (or so they claimed) but always came together at the end for a heartfelt life lesson. Seinfeld thought outside the box and pushed these rules aside. This unique and original groundwork paved the way for Seinfeld to become the GREATEST SHOW OF ALL TIME.",1408579200,,1072,4.446700507614213

2940051,5,B000VECAEE,a great collection for future viewing of a great show that ran many seasons with many laughs and clean fun.,1403136000,,107,4.4
2940052,5,B000VECAEE,"Often decried as ""a show about nothing,"" ""Seinfeld"" was in fact about life in all its particulars. When most other sitcoms had an overall theme or gimmick, ""Seinfeld"" focused on the characters and their interactions with each other and the outside world.

One criticism was that the characters were too self-centered. The final episode atoned for this, and I use the word ""atoned"" in the sense of repentance from sin. Stranded in a strange town, they witness a carjacking. Instead of helping the victim, they film the crime, exemplifying Susan Sontag's observation that the photographer can either document events or participate in them, but not both. It turns out that this town has a law requiring anyone witnessing a crime to assist the victim, so Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer are arrested and brought to trial. The prosecution calls as witnesses many of the other characters that the main ones have wronged through the entire series. The series ends with their conviction and imprisonment.

It turns out that the show wasn't about ""nothing"" at all; it was about justice and our responsibility toward other human beings - a weighty topic if there ever was one. And in the end, justice was served. It fulfills the sage Hillel's observation, ""If I am not for myself, then who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, of what use am I? And if not now, when?""

This ending confused many people, as no one expected a comedy to go out on a downer. But the writers' intentions became clear to me after watching a few episodes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curb-Your-Enthusiasm/dp/B0000E2PVR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, a creation of Larry David, one of the ""Seinfeld"" writers. This inescapable sense of justice was the theme of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" In every show, David tries to get one over on someone - to make a deal, to get something he's not entitled to, to wring a reluctant apology out of someone or avoid giving a much-deserved apology to someone himself. And every time, he gets a karmic payback, even if he doesn't notice. God may be dead, but the terrible hand of justice remains.",1403136000,,2172,5.044568245125348
2940053,3,B000VECAEE,"Yes three stars. Why? The packaging. The movies are great. Nothing wrong there, but the packaging of them is horrid. As soon as we received these the disks they fell out.
Nothing happened to them but out they came. They won't stay in. The slots that hold the disk are not even secured to the box. They slide out onto the floor anytime you open it up. So disappointed in this .

In the description it was stated that there were a few holes in the factory stretch wrap around the refrigerator. That was indeed the case and were minor. My son took it all apart like a child, he was so excited to have this set! Everything from the magnets that were promised and the coffee table book to every one of the series dvds was in the refrigerator as promised. My son was so excited and pleased to receive such a gift that he thanked us over and over.

I was lucky, and perfectly willing to purchase this for $200 at BORDERS when they were still in business.  I was lucky and had a coupon for 40% and actually got this awesome series collection for $120.  Sorry, I know I'm bragging a tad.  Just be happy for me okay...

Anyway, the collection is very nice.  It has a lovely black finish with the Seinfeld logo in gold.  It's got three pockets, two of which hold the DVD cases; each one is like a little book that opens up into two halves, each half containing 8 discs...32 discs in all, plus a bonus discs with features.  The third pocket is for the very nice book that chronicles the show's more memorable moments.  In addition, there's a laminated sheet that lists each of the 180 episodes in order, by season.  Nice to have.

This is not a cheap looking, thrown together collection.  It's simple, but quality made and the book adds a lot of value.  Highly recommended for any Seinfeld fan.",1384732800,,1071,4.487046632124352
2940103,5,B000VECAEE,"The only reason this reviewer bought ""Seinfeld: The Complete Series"" box set is because recently, the local & cable tv markets have replaced showing the syndication episodes of SEINFELD reruns with the syndicated reruns of (over the past year) THE BIG BANG THEORY, and more recently MODERN FAMILY.  This reviewer would have never thought in all the years of watching the SEINFELD syndicated reruns that it would ever disappear. But SEINFELD has been in syndication for over 10 years and a new generation of tv viewers, (some of who  weren't even born during SEINFELD's domination of ""Must See TV"" in the 90's) have come of age and probably think SEINFELD is ancient and old school which is understandable. It has happened to other series classic tv series from M*A*S*H, CHEERS, etc. -- Now viewing the classic SEINFELD series in [this] format with all the EXTRAS, from cast interviews, mini-documentary featurettes, episode guides, deleted scenes, outakes, bloopers, and without all the commerical interruptions...the box set has breathed new life into the series for this reviewer. Also, this particular box set comes with a Coffee Table Book of the series (a nice little in-joke for the hard core SEINFELD fans!).",1384646400,,1215,5.1313131313131315

2940141,5,B000VECAEE,"I'm a huge ""Seinfeld"" fan, and I want this item BADLY...it's just not in the budget at the moment. I will probably buy it sooner or later.

But I have watched all of the discs in the set (assuming they are the same DVDs from the individual seasons). They're real, and they're spectacular. Not only do you get all of the episodes, they have created a ""Behind the Scenes"" look at every single episode, including interviews with all of the principals (including Larry David) and many of the other players. They even included some of the promo spots, deleted scenes, versions with alternate actors (Frank Costanza was played by John Randolph in ""The Handicapped Spot,"" and then the scene was reshot later with Jerry Stiller for continuity; Larry David an off-camera Newman in ""The Suicide,"" which was re-recorded later with Wayne Knight's voice for continuity), gag reels and the two one-hour clip show episodes. It's really everything you could possibly want to know about the show. I enjoy those features because they create a window into the creative process.

The fact that the box set looks like a coffee table is just a perfect reference to Kramer's coffee table book about coffee tables. Kramer's book (and apparently this box set) appear to have legs that turn them into coffee tables (in case you don't have a coffee table already).

The early years of ""Seinfeld"" were lean in terms of ratings, and the show was nearly cancelled a number of times. The focus group feedback from the pilot was bad, and even when they agreed to do a ""season,"" that initial contract was only for four episodes. Add in the pilot, and Season 1 is only 5 episodes total. Season 2 was only for 13 episodes, and one of those didn't air until Season 3. A typical season afterward was for 22-24 episodes. The ""How It All Began"" feature delves into this, and the feature on ""The Chinese Restaurant"" goes into more detail. They also did a great feature on ""The Breakthrough Season.""",1374192000,2,1958,4.719298245614035

2940222,5,B000VECAEE,"""Seinfeld"" - The Complete Series is dozens of hours of good medicine and is the ultimate way to experience one of the best sitcoms of all time.

The nine seasons from 1989 - 1998 captures some of the essence of the wonderful decade that was the 1990s, with popular culture at the centre of many episodes. The series is very much an example of sociological entertainment.

Seinfeld contains so many takes on the everyday, stacked with good humour, and this proved to be the recipe for everlasting comedic greatness.

2.  The disc holders are a joke.  It's just a bunch of CD cases LITERALLY TAPED TOGETHER.  Shortly after opening them to inspect the tape came lose on one set of disks and I can already tell it's not going to work as a long term storage solution.

If you don't mind going out and buying a binder just for your Seinfeld disks then this is a great buy.  If you're a collector looking for something you can show off on your mantle stay away.",1321315200,5,921,4.4226190476190474

2940248,5,B000VECAEE,I LOVE Seinfeld. I've watched this boxed set several times over. I still laugh at all the funny parts. The extras are great! Really ALOT of extras! A gem I will keep for a very long time.,1319241600,,187,4.081081081081081
2940259,5,B000VECAEE,"I'm such a Sienfeld fan that after buying the whole series individually by season, I sold them all so that I could have The Complete Series boxset and all of the extras.  The Coffee table book itself is worth it alone to me.  Another plus about having this boxset is that all the DVDs are packaged in 2 booklet cases so now I won't have to fumble through the individual seasons.

I was lucky enough to buy this during a Lightning Deal and pick it up at a great price.  All the other reviews explain why this boxset is so great, I'm just happy to finally own it.",1317081600,,561,4.166666666666667

2940261,4,B000VECAEE,"Seinfeld is hands down the best television series created for all time.  The box set I bought was exactly what I was looking for.  Purchasing this instead of attempting to track down all of the season box sets individually is well worth the extra money.  The ""coffee table book"" it comes with is also a very nice addition to the package, it gives insight to the show that you could never obtain without it.  In the future, sellers of this series box set should be aware of the potential for damage during shipment.  The sleek black case that the series comes in is made of reinforced card board, making the corners very easy to crunch.  My package came in a cardboard box and was not handled very well in transit.  Any damage the cardboard box incurred transfered to the black case.  It should be shipped in a reinforced box, maybe with packaging kernals.",1315785600,,855,4.542483660130719
2940262,5,B000VECAEE,"They say that laughter is the best medicine for the soul. I have to say that watching the complete series of Seinfeld has become an addiction for me! My routine almost every night is to stick in one of the CD's from this series and get a good laugh before I go to sleep. The chemistry of the four characters on this show is amazing. My whole family loves to watch Seinfeld and throughout the week we always refer to Kramer, George, Elaine, or Jerry with reference to something in real life and get a laugh about it. All I can say is that with all the hardships of life - I am grateful that I can always pop in a Seinfeld episode and get some good medicine for my soul and see the lighter side of life which makes things seem alright.",1311292800,3,733,4.1328671328671325

2940264,2,B000VECAEE,There are several episodes missing. Especially the one where they go to India. That's my all-time favorite episode. I also had missing discs and duplicate discs. Blah...so disappointed!,1310083200,6,185,5.642857142857143
2940265,5,B000VECAEE,"The Complete Series set for Seinfeld is easily the Ultimate set to own if you are a fan of the show. This set delivers on so many levels it is mind blowing. This easily is the must have set for any Seinfeld fan.

Seinfeld was a show that ran from 1990 - 1998 ( 9 seasons ). The show rarely had any sort of storyline in place, and when it did the storyline only ran a few episodes at most. Seinfeld beautifully executed a show basically about NOTHING! That's right. This show is about nothing... otherwise known as ""every day life"". Throw in some extremely well written comedy and very memorable characters, and it is no surprise that this show is up there as one of the great TV classics of all time. All the characters flow so well together, the most ridiculous things could happen and it is just downright hysterical. One of my personal favorites is when Jerry & the gang meet ""Bizarro Jerry"" like Superman and Bizarro Superman.

Anyhow, this boxset pays homage to this true classic of a show by going the extra mile with both presentation and quality. There are almost no CONS to this set. The set comes in a large 10.5 inches tall box with a picture of the main cast on the front. Inside the standup case is three items of interest

1. Seinfeld: The Coffee Table Book. As seen in Seinfeld, the epic Coffee Table book about Coffee Tables... this book essentially recreates that moment. It is hardbound book (Faux Leather I believe) with gold leaf and etchings on it. Inside is your complete Episode guide(laminated for protection) & a Full color book containing memorable quotes and moments from each episode in the show. It also contains bio's on the cast and a few extras such as letters to NBC about the show.

2. ""The Round-Table"" DVD found at the back of the Hardcover book; which is an hour long interview with the cast and creator
3. Faux Leather case for Seasons 1-5 & 6-9

Each disk has a color image of the staring cast on it and is held in a thin plastic disk-holder. The episodes are arranged by chronological order instead of air-date. Each disk contains additional bonus features; bonus features, alternative takes, etc.

As you can see this boxset is truly a COMPLETE edition. There is so much going on here it is amazing. The case and quality of the materials is outside and the set goes above and beyond to satisfy any die-hard fan of the show. The only real negative I see to this entire set is how the DVD's are stored. Each DVD is held in a thin(1/4 inch thick) plastic Disk holder flip book... 8 disks per side. Compared to the rest of the set this just seems very cheap and flimsy; especially after how much quality went into everything else. Despite my concerns, with just a little extra care when removing a disk, the set has held up exceptionally well over the past 2 years I have owned it.

OVERALL this set is just magnificent and happens to be the most beautiful DVD boxset that I own. While the price is a bit steep, I feel that this boxset is worth paying the extra $$ for. It truly is a complete set and does the show justice. 5 stars!!!

**NOTE: Recently the price fluctuates heavily for this item. Keep an eye on the item and wait for Amazon to hold a DVD blowout sale. You might be able to save upwards of 50-60% against retail.",1309910400,10,3265,4.411960132890365
2940266,5,B000VECAEE,"The complete series of Seinfeld is an eye-watering 175 in the UK so I was attracted to an offer (via Amazon.com) which was for a good condition 'used' set from the USA. Although the (somewhat flimsily designed) box showed a few signs of wear I was delighted with the contents; the set cost me around 75 including air mail postage, a saving of some 100! It is truly a wonderful land mark comedy series compiled in more restrained times when foul language could not be substituted for intelligent humour. Consequently it is sharper, wittier and more inclusive than 'Curb' and the like.
Terrific value and a joy for generations to come.",1309824000,,633,4.711711711711712

Im telling you put this on your wish list and watch almost every 2 days the price either dips or rises. Please... if you interested in this product... DO NOT BUY unless its at least under $130.

2940279,5,B000VECAEE,"I had forgotten just how defining to our generation, this sitcom is!  It is a laugh riot, and now enjoyed even by my children! It displays a risky but quirky approach to most of the societal ""issues"" of our time-and still keeps you laughing! Even when the characters neurotic tendencies reach a ridiculous climax of annoyance...you still have to keep watching. One of the frustrating things that most shows are really terrible with, is contenuity...of story and character.  This show is really on top of all the past experiences and subtleties of each main character, as well as the guests. The extras on each cd are wonderful, and very insightful to the actual personalities involved in the success of this show! Sit back and get ready to laugh!!!!",1307318400,,749,4.84375

This series was a dog, is a dog, and will always be a dog.  The situation and plots are not realistic in any way.  After a few episodes, the characters are all so predictable, you can guess their lines before they recite them.  The most unentertaining of the characters is Seinfeld himself, but all the characters get real old real fast.  The material is extremely shallow and directed at those with low IQs.  The TV network that aired this dog series was really scraping the sludge in the bottom of the gutters, when it pulled out this one.  I also once saw Seinfeld live, and it was even worse.",1302998400,8,772,5.547008547008547

2940287,2,B000VECAEE,"I am seeing a lot of reviews here for the Seinfeld series itself.  This review is about what you are actually intending on buying: the DVD set.  The vast majority of the population knows what Seinfeld is, and likes it a lot.  No need to belabor it.  The important things to know about this DVD set are the following.  The overall presenation is nice, albeit bulky and heavy.  The coffee table book is interesting, but you'll probably never read it or at least not more than once.  The presentation of the DVDs is rather poor, and makes getting to individual episodes a bit tedious.  Finally, and this is the huge problem with this set, the video mastering of the DVDs is horrible.  Now, I know that the source is not the problem here as Seinfeld is currently airing in high definition on cable.  In fact, the channels that air Seinfeld in standard definition look as good if not better than these DVDs.  There is flagrant compression artifacts in the picture, the picture looks very soft, overall tonality and color can best be described as ""dingy.""  It really is a major disappointment if you have any visual scrutiny when watching video.  Hopefully they will re-master this for the Blu-ray format.",1302393600,37,1199,4.679425837320574

But it turns out, this is just how the studio produced these DVD's.  So if you buy this, don't be alarmed that it seems cheap.  It's not the product itself.
The one thing that doesn't seem cheap is the coffee table book that comes with the collection.  It has great info for every single episode.  I consider myself a real fan of the show and I even learned some things from it.  Great buy from Amazon gold box!",1300665600,3,574,4.163636363636364

My only complaint is that the glue on the packaging is coming off and the discs are starting to fall out. Handled with care, it should be okay.",1299801600,,340,3.927536231884058
2940302,5,B000VECAEE,"I'll keep this short. This is an extremely intelligent and groundbreaking comedy. I love it.
I recommended it to some people but some of them didn't enjoy it much, probably because it seems ""old"" to some of them, or maybe they wanted something else, but without seinfeld comedy as there is today in television wouldn't exist. I'm not only talking about the jokes but also about the structure of comedy writing.

It's a comedy that never drifts away from his style, the heart of Seinfeld is always there, from start to finish (Something I cannot say about all tv-series).

This is a great set containing the 9 seasons and some good extras. I always enjoy Audio Commentaries.  I got it for $90 here on amazon, it was a good deal.

Right now is 180$, it's a bit overpriced but if you're a Seinfeld fan it's worth it. If you haven't seen it much maybe wait until the price drops, but I assure you it's worth it.",1298505600,13,907,4.445783132530121

2940304,5,B000VECAEE,"This is a magnificent box set.  The packaging, while unusual, looks great and is very good quality. I can't think of a better way to package 32 discs without taking up a whole shelf.  The episodes look perfect (no freezing, pixellating etc) and the discs operate flawlessly.

All 32 discs feature extras such as commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, animations, interviews and the odd easter egg.  My favourite is ""Notes About Nothing"", a great subtitle extra providing technical info, background on guest stars as they appear, and other assorted trivia.  I do believe it is available for every episode. In fact, you could make a pretty impressive box set out of just the extras!

Now, you may read some bitter and clueless ""reviews"" here.  The packaging is not flimsy - treat it with the respect a $150+ box set deserves and you'll be fine.  As for the disc labelling being ""confusing"", it's perfectly simple: seasons 1 and 2 are combined onto four discs, then each subsequent season is four discs.  Yes, the printing on the discs stating which season is small, but it is easy to tell where you're up to.  Discs for all seasons feature the main cast in the following order: disc 1, Jerry; disc 2, Elaine; disc 3, George; and disc 4, Kramer.  It's really not that hard.

My only gripe is the booklet listing the episodes doesn't contain a brief synopsis of each episode.  But I'm not taking a whole star off just for that.",1296259200,2,1424,4.693548387096774

I purchased 2, I kept one for myself and I gave the other away as a Christmas present. The Christmas present was for our annual dirty santa gift exchange, needless to say it was the most sought after gift of the night. Anyways.. this is the best collection I have ever seen. The included ""Coffee Table Book"" is a catchy phrase only, its not actually the coffee table book from the episode with Kramer on the Reggis Show. This coffee table book was created to reside on your coffee table so your guest can look through it.. It is a keep sake in it self, it explains each episode and includes insight into other aspects of the show. The episodes themselves include all the episodes from the years Seinfeld was on TV including: Original Pilot, 2nd Pilot, all the years and a bonus DVD with Cast, Crew, Producers, and Directors.

Seinfeld is so huge, they could easily make a ""Movie about Nothing""?
I would go and see it.

Sure, there are people moaning about having bought all of the previous individual sets who are now upset that there is a complete box set, but come on, that's the natural order of things. First they release the individuals - then the boxset. It's basic capitalism unfortunately.
Anyway I digress. Whether you have waited for this incredible compendium or are flip flopping back and forth trying to decide whether to buy the box set as well, let me say - HELLO! buy it!
With the coffee table book thrown in, a very sleek and slender double DVD case for all of the discs, and the fact that Seinfeld has to be the greatest TV programme in history, this is an absolute no brainer!

The shows of course are awesome. What I was most disappointed in was that it said the official coffee table book. Well anyone that watches Seinfeld is expecting a book about coffee tables that folds out into a coffee table as Kramer designed it. Well it is a book abou Seinfeld. That's great and all but I think it is a little misleading.  I have seen several reviews from people expecting the same thing I was. Overall I still got a wonderful set of DVD's that we will watch over and over.,1293321600,,658,4.222222222222222
2940356,5,B000VECAEE,This was a great Christmas gift. The packaging makes it easy to find your favorite episode. It also came with a great coffee table book with a synopsis of each episode with some little facts about each show. I would definitely recommend this to any Seinfeld fan.,1293321600,,262,4.595744680851064
2940357,5,B000VECAEE,"I didn't catch onto Seinfield immediately but got somewhat addicted to it over the years.  After its final airing I found myself watching re-runs whenever channel surfing, although I never went out of my way to keep up with the re-runs from one airing to the next.  Seeing the box set for the first time when it initially became available sparked my curiosity about actually owning the entire serious - if I would watch it or just let it collect dust.  What finally caused me to buy it after placing it on my shopping list and then thereafter removing it was when it was put on a Gold Box sale one day, in which it was significantly marked down in price!

Although I'm not a hoarder of box sets, I'll have to say that this one comes across as high quality.  The box itself is nice, and the cases the dvds are in are well constructed and thoughtfully designed.  All too often I've read reviews of box sets where the box is cheaply designed or it's a challenge getting to the dvds.  Everything about this box set makes you feel like you have definitely gotten your money's worth!

Whether or not I'll get around to watching every episode is yet to be determined, but so far it seems pretty likely.  If you should decide to buy this box set, know that you are getting something well designed and constructed, so the only question should be is how much Seinfield can you watch?!  Enjoy!",1293062400,,1382,4.426877470355731
2940358,5,B000VECAEE,"I bought several years ago and at ANY price this is a great DVD Set but especially if you get it when it's lower priced! Lovers of Seinfeld will appreciate this amazing gift that will give countless hours of TV show viewing commercial free, the extras are just a bonus from the original shows.",1292457600,,293,4.444444444444445
2940359,5,B000VECAEE,I do not usually order items sight unseen but decided to make an exception this time.  I am so glad that I did so.  This series was done with quality and care.  It is beautifully packaged and would make a great gift for any fan of Seinfeld.  It was packaged very carefully for shipping and arrived in excellent condition.  I am quite satisfied  and will not hesitate to do business with Amazon in the future.  I highly recommend this series.,1291507200,2,441,4.4375
2940360,5,B000VECAEE,"If you love Jerry Seinfeld you will fall in love with this set of Seinfeld series. I have watched it several times through already, a matter of fact i quote their quotes from the show. its GREAT! Get it NOW!!!",1290384000,,209,4.25
2940361,5,B000VECAEE,"Love this set! I have now finished the first 4 seasons and I have yet to find an episode where I didn't laugh the whole way through. Such clever dialog! The complete series is perfect; I love the packaging, the coffee table book and the way it's all set up. It is soo worth the money. I picked mine up for less than $100 which is incredible to be able to have every episode ever made plus a sweet book that talks about the different seasons. I love this series and think everyone should pick it up. Will they come out with a blu ray set? Who knows. Even if they did though, I doubt they would really enhance the quality of every episode to make it worth the extra money. The dvd's aren't the best picture quality but for the price you really can't complain. Highly recommended!",1287187200,,777,4.256756756756757
2940382,5,B000VECAEE,"I just purchased this complete series of Seinfeld a few months ago.  I had my dvr set up to record every episode of Seinfeld in repeats.  So every night I would watch 2-3 episodes before bed and it was my regular routine.  They aired the final episode and the reruns started from the first one again and I thought how stupid could I be.  I love this show.  I will watch it over and over.  So I looked into purchasing it as a complete series.  And what I found - this item here - was a godsend.  Now I can watch every episode from the beginning in order, digitally remastered with an added 2-3 minutes per episode with the cuts for tv airing gone.  And let me tell you the difference in video quality is amazing.  Now if you are looking at this item you are obviously a Seinfeld fan so I am going to write more on the quality of the set - The Complete Series.

I have purchased many complete series sets of other shows and have never, ever seen one of the quality of Seinfeld.  Anything you read in the item description praising its construction cannot be written well enough to honestly show its brilliance.  The collectors case is made of the sturdiest heavy cardboard and it stands an estimated 11"" by 7"".  It is very classy in pure black with a small photo of the cast embossed in the center of the front.  And the title Seinfeld is embossed in bold gold on the side.  Turn it to the side and there are three compartments.  The long side compartment holds the superb coffee table book and the other two are separate sections that hold cases that contain the episode discs.  The first is a trifold case that holds series 1-5 and the second is the same but carries seasons 6-9.  There are 32 discs total.

The coffee table book is a beautiful hardback book that is worth much just in itself.  It is a 226 page anthology with descriptions of each episode, pictures, quotes and trivia.  The facts in this book are amazing and tell why the show made many decisions in plot, casting and plot.  It is a dream for any Seinfeld fan.  And we also get the bonus disc of the cast reunion.  Bottom line is that nothing was spared with this complete series set.  It is a true gift to Seinfeld fans.  The discs of the series you get are the same you got if you purchased them individually as they were for sale.  The unique thing about Seinfeld is that the extras with each season are actually worth viewing.  There is a making of documentary of each season, bloopers and very informative and fun features.  People who already own the series individually often get angry at having to ""double dip""  but what this item costs now makes it a no brainer to purchase.  As I said the coffeee table book is an expensive item in itself.  And series have been on dvd long enough now that people must realize they certainly can purchase each season as it is released but ultimately when the show has run its course there will be a complete series set released.

I cannot praise the Seinfeld Complete Series set enough.  it is one of my favorite shows of all time and here it is presented in all its remastered glory with all the Seinfeld trivia and features I could want.  And I want to end by noting that the collector's case is so nice that I actually have it displayed on top of a bookcase.  It is in no way cheesy but put together as an elegant piece of art.  I am so glad that I came to my senses and stopped watching the reruns on tv and invested in this amazing set that I will now have for a lifetime.",1284336000,9,3486,4.273700305810397

2940385,5,B000VECAEE,"I originaly wanted to purchase this set but I received it as a birthday gift instead. The series is awesome. I love how it comes with all the episodes. The coffee table book included is also great because it gives a short description of all the episodes, incase you don't remember something. Finally I can watch any episode I want anytime and with no commercials. One more thing, the whole series is neatly packaged in a good sized box no more bigger than a shoe box so it doesn't take up very much space. This set truly is the best.

2940388,5,B000VECAEE,You won't be disappointed!  A lot of insight into the making of the show and several extras you don't get in syndication!  Example:  Did you know that Jerry Stiller wasn't originally cast as Frank Costanza?,1280620800,,206,4.828571428571428
2940389,5,B000VECAEE,"This set is as well done as the series. Having been a Seinfeld fan for years it is nice to have all the episodes plus the ""extras. The set is very nicely boxed: there is a commemorative book that has some information about each episode, a sheet with a table of contents like listing of all the episodes, and the DVDs are in two binders, each disc in its own tray (less risk of scratching as with some other TV series DVD compilations). Each DVD offers the option to watch the episode alone, or with ""Notes About Nothing"" which is script on the screen throughtout the episode that gives further detail about the episode, the cast, the set, or background on whatever is being discussed on screen. This latter piece will probably be helpful for future generations watching the show that may not be aware of the events that were current and discussed at the time. Each DVD also has ""extras"": commentaries by the cast and staff on certain episodes, deleted scenes, bloopers, advertisements that were televised to promote the show at the time it was on (before syndication), interviews with the cast, writers, NBC and Castle Rock officials, and ""inside looks"" where cast and/or writers give insight into the development of that episode-a little background on how it was developed, obstacles, difficulties, etc. In summary, this is a very well done, comprehensive offering of the Seinfeld TV show. I would not have purchased it at full price, but it was an amazing deal on one of Amazon's deal-of-the-day offerings.",1280102400,,1508,4.803846153846154

But, the cases themselves were broken on the seams and unglued from the packaging causing the DVD holder to fall upon opening the package.  Also, the book that came with the set had some broken binding.

If the gift was bought for me I would be happy that the DVD's were in good shape but, it was an anniversary give for my girlfriend and she was not pleased with the damaged goods.  She is a huge fan of Seinfeld and was let down by the packaging.",1276646400,2,526,4.336734693877551

No wonder ""Seinfeld"" was voted the best Show in the history of television in a poll by TV Guide. I have watched the show many times, all seasons from start to finish and will continue watching it. It never gets old. Seasons 5-9 are my favorites and my favorite episodes are ""The Soup Nazi,"" ""The Hamptons,"" ""The Apology,"" ""The face painter,"" ""The Burning,"" ""The Dealership"" and many others.

2940429,4,B000VECAEE,"This review will be short and sweet. Seinfeld is one of the greatest, most defining shows ever to be on television. Simply put, it you haven't watched, you need to. I picked this up on deal of the day for an excellent price and I couldn't be happier. The show itself, in my opinion, is wonderful, and it never gets old. I can watch these episodes over and over and never get tired of it. This set is packed with hours of bonus footage, including interviews, commentaries, and even some Seinfeld Animation. It also includes a very nice, detailed episode guide that has pictures, quotes, and other info on every episode. As you can probably tell, the show itself would get a five star rating from me, if I was only rating the show. The reason for my four star review is that the plastic cases that the disc are contained in are cracked on the bottom. This hasn't affected the play at all, and it seems to be holding up ok, but it was a little disappointing. I noticed it a few days after I received the set, so I'm not exactly sure if I done it or not, but I'm pretty sure it came that way because all it had done was set on my shelf. If you have a chance, you need to pick up this set. You will be very happy you did.",1268611200,5,1216,4.135021097046414

It was scratched, faded slightly and 1 part at the bottom of the exterior container had collapsed in a bit which makes it far from ""Very Good"" condition to me.

2940482,4,B000VECAEE,"The set is nice.  The coffee table book is worth buying the set rather than the individual seasons.  However, I will say that I was disappointed with the cases for the discs.  The plastic cases are stuck in a cover with double-sided tape, which doesn't hold well at all.  The set is worth it, but you will probably be upset if your discs fall out of the case and scratch.  Just be careful when you are handling the set and it will be fine.  Would definitely buy again.",1265587200,5,468,4.261363636363637

From the same seller.
The first shipment was packed in a reasonable manner, not really good, because this refridgerator pack is what it's all about, and it was dented and chipped.
So when ordering the next time, I asked the seller directly to pack it in a more sturdy box, which he did, lots of styropor foam to buffer, but now the packaging was ( again) dented and even had a small hole in the corner.
Since they forgot to take out the pin, probably this one had been on display in their store and the pin was to communicate the price.
I feel robbed because this was not mentioned at all.
Since I live in Europe, it was easy for this seller, because how am I going to complain? Well: The product is fine, the seller was not honest enough on the state of the fridge, the one and only reason to buy this unit.

They appear as very plain-font text like a closed-caption or a subtitle, sometimes changing at far too slow a speed and suddenly blazing by with mounds of text in which the only way to read it is by pausing. In both instances there seems to be no need to stretch out or rush through the info as they do, making the practice utterly nonsensical.

The ""Notes"" often give info needed to understand ""reference"" jokes, as they should, e.g. when Jerry says, ""He holds a grudge like Khomeini."". That's understandable and completely fine, but the notes often go into far too much unnecessary detail on the related facts, even going beyond overexplaining the joke, to jabbering on about unrelated facts on whatever reference it is, from Finland to the Kennedys.

I can't quite recommend this set unless you find it for a fraction of the retail price, especially since the show is still so ubiquitously syndicated. I will watch all the Notes just so I see everything that's in the set, but the only real benefit of having this set is having every episode at my beck and call and not having to sit through commercials. But this is one set that really NEEDS to have an improved re-release.

While it's ridiculous to complain that they might have been planning a re-release all along (more apt to complain if they aren't planning it and dragging their feet on it), it's equally reasonable to vilify them for producing such a crappy product in the interim for such a landmark, brilliant show.",1260835200,9,1921,4.8121212121212125

2940543,5,B000VECAEE,"What is there really to review with ""Seinfeld - The Complete Series""? If you had a TV in 1990's on Thursday nights it was most likely tuned into ""Seinfeld""...it really is as simple as that. Finally the entire series is compiled into a nice box set here, and any fan of the show will want to own it.

If you've already dropped the money on the individual seasons, there isn't a need to buy this as there aren't any new ""extras"", just more convenient packaging.

My wife and just finished Season 9 last night with the final episode. I loved watching the show in chronological order, there are so many little things I missed the first time around, or by catching the odd re-run here and there (Jerry calling George ""Biff"" after the ""Death of Salesman"" character through two seasons, why George started referring to himself in the 3rd person etc.) ""Seinfeld"" is consistantly funny, finding humor in the everyday, mundane things, like a woman who doesn't swing her arms when she walks. This is a character driven show, and with Elaine, George, Jerry & Kramer it's easy to see why ""Seinfeld"" was a show about nothing, these characters didn't need the typical sitcom plotlines in order to make comedy gold. Simply putting the four of them in a room together was more than enough to get the laughter started.

This is a show you can go back and watch over-and-over again, always finding something new to chuckle at. If you haven't watched ""Seinfeld"" since the days of ""Must See TV"" do yourself a favor and pick this up.",1258070400,2,1511,4.609665427509293

My gripe is this: the DVDs are terrible. They are of very low quality, episodes often freeze for seconds and do that crazy digital pixelation thing frequently. I got this as a Christmas present from my wife but soon returned it when I saw the state of the discs. Got a whole new set and they act pretty much the same way.

2940574,5,B000VECAEE,"People ask here in the other reviews how a comedy about four self absorbed people could be so funny and excellent.  After all, shouldn't we dislike Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer?  No, the reason we were rapt with their lives is because just like Desi and Lucy mirrored the 1950s, this quartet mirrored the 1990s.  In the 1950s, most people were in a marriage like Desi's and Lucy's. They might have felt like they were in a straightjacket but at least they were fully connected with their extended families and friends. By the 1990s, people were no longer in the straightjacket.  They had their full freedom and could remain as single and unconnected as they wished.  They now wanted perfection before they committed.  Many of them chewed through their entire 20s and 30s looking for the perfection connection or none.  So the quartet of Seinfeld characters rejected everyone but themselves for nine solid years and then ended the show as unconnected as the day the show began.  This show is also genius at zeroing in on the day to day foibles of people.  It also tackles previously taboo areas of sitcoms.  For example, George loses his fiance in this show in a way no one in sitcom history has ever lost a fiance and it is hilarious. Larry David was the genius hand guiding the show but he was infrequently on camera as a character.  However, I loved it when he played Stienbrenner, head of the New York Yankees and George's boss.  I adore this show and love watching the episodes again.  Any time I need an up, it is either this show or FRASIER. There are no substitutions.

The box itself is a hefty and well constructed.  The book is heavy and the quality of paper and photos are excellent.

The box itself is slightly vulnerable to smudges from oil on your hands, but it's not bad.  Did I mention it's heavy, well made, and looks good?

The DVD's speak for themselves.  They are the show you know and love.  There's also commentary, bonus material, cut scenes, and all the stuff you'd expect in a box set.

If you bought the individual DVD seasons, there's not much need to buy the box set, except if you view it as a collectors item.

Then to correct this gross mistake, a 7"" x 10"" glossy sheet is provided.  AGAIN listing episodes 1 - 180 but with small headers assigning titles to specific discs.
You constantly have to refer from the book to the glossy sheet and back.

The second season things picked up, but it was the third season that this show became great. Seasons 3-6 were arguably where the show peeked, but it continued to have good episodes all the way into season 9. Ironically one of the best shows ever had one of the worst finallies ever, with the last episode being one of the worst of the show. Seinfeld's main cast of characters were excellent, as were many of the reoccurring side characters and guest stars. The best episodes in this show are just plain hilarious.

She was surprised to learn that the series was shot in California and not New York (where is it set).

2940821,5,B000VECAEE,"It' s been ten years  since the show about a stand-up New-York City comedian , ""neat freak"" named  Jerry Seinfeld  and his three colorful friends, a  loser, a doofus, and a neurotic ex-girlfriend,  aired its final episode on May 14, 1998 but still no sitcom  on TV has came close to its  incomparable brilliancy which  lies in the ability to somehow make a viewer addicted to the  narcissist and selfish characters that constantly put themselves into the pointless and absurd situations.  I still remember how I became a fan. One evening, my husband and two sons were watching the episode called ""The Rye"", and I stopped, watched for a few minutes, told them to move over - and the rest is history. I fell in love instantly and forever. Since that night, I watched the new episodes and re-runs whenever it was possible and I've become one of the millions of fans of the greatest show about nothing ever written, directed, and produced. In its best episodes, ""Seinfeld"" is perfection that no other show would ever achieve, and there are many great episodes. Even now after all these years I keep asking myself why the show about four rather selfish, ego-centric, immature, often back-stabbing and outrageous characters who are afraid of commitments has been so universally loved and admired? Maybe we can see ourselves in them? Or, the secret to Seinfeld's success was the misanthropic Larry David, the failed comedian but talented writer who uses humor derived from awkward social situations, and his collaboration with Jerry Seinfeld?  Or maybe as a really great work of art, the show defies any explanation? The sitcom has given us so many unforgettable minutes of joy, that it will never be replaced. Even Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry David's baby in all its greatness is not as enjoyable as ""Seinfeld."" CUE is about George Costanza whose dreams came true - he is rich and has a beautiful loving wife but he does not have Jerry, Cramer, and Elaine in his life, and their absence shows.

Some of my favorite episodes - ""The Soup Nazi"", ""The Chinese Restaurant"", ""The Pez Dispenser"", ""The Limo"", ""The Bubble Boy"",  ""The Contest"" -""that's the best, Jerry, that's the best from the masters of their domains"", The Puffy Shirt, The Hamptons, oh my God, there are so many! And how many quotes from the show have become the part of every day conversations,  ""yada yada yada"","" they are real and spectacular"", ""Jerry, just remember, it's not a lie if you believe it."" ""Hello, Jerry. Hello, Newman"".

I had a great time, so I decided to catch up with what I was missing on the TV show.  I managed to catch up within a year or so (that's how much Seinfeld shows in syndication.  I watched 9 years of episodes in a year).  Now I have realised that it is one of the greatest sitcoms ever produced, not only in America, but in the world.

Some of my favorite episodes are the following.  I love the Bookman/Tropic of Cancer episode, where Philip Baker Hall (as Mr. Bookman) elevates playing the straight man to an art form.  I love the episode where Susan dies from bad invitations, the Soup Nazi (probably my favorite), and the later episode where Kramer has the old Merv Griffin set in his bedroom and Jerry plays with his girlfriend's toy collection.  Now, the early episodes are the best (as with all sitcoms), and when Larry David left, the series faltered.  It wasn't unwatchable, but there was a sloppiness in the writing, and the acting became very stale and mannered.  Some of the episodes were downright preposterous, such as the rickshaw one, which has to be the worst episode in Seinfeld history.  And I never really liked the final episode.  I felt it was very sloppy, almost like an afterthought, and not particularly realistic, even in the ""Seinfeld universe"", despite it being penned by Larry David himself.  Bringing back all the characters from the show was interesting, but ultimately it seemed too much, and the plotline (that people would actually go to jail for not being good Samaritans) was kind of silly.  And why didn't they bring back Jerry's finance (wonderfully played by Janeane Garofalo) in the final episode?  Who knows?  Maybe she's on the cutting room floor.

The series had 4 great main characters, unique, interesting, quirky, but still real and very, very flawed.  Many of the supporting players were brilliant as well.  Jackie Chiles, played by Phil Morris, the constantly put down lawyer, was hilarious.  Newman, played by Wayne Knight, has to be one of the greatest supporting characters in sitcom history.  And Puddy, Elaine's part time boyfriend, played by Patrick Warburton, is also very underrated and it absolutely hilarious in every episode he appears in.  Also Jerry Stiller as George's dad and Estelle Harris as George's mom are brilliant too.

The whole series really broke sitcom rules, in that everyone in the series is not a particularly nice person.  They're all flawed, selfish, ignorant, silly, but most of all, human.  And hilarious.  Larry David was the brains behind this series (which you can really feel his absence in the later seasons), and George Costanza IS Larry David (you'll see this after seeing Curb Your Enthusiasm).

Despite being a product of the 90's, the show hasn't dated.  It's still fresh and hilarious, like all great sitcoms.

I'm glad my sister gave me those tickets, otherwise I would have foolishly ignored this series longer.",1206489600,,3300,4.796099290780142

The rating system on amazon is for rating the product, not to rate yourself, you one star people. No one is going to boycott this set because it is better and cheeper than buying each set individually. If you have bought each set, sell them and buy this set, Amazon makes it very easy to sell your used dvds. Sony is not going to release the book either because they want you to buy this set. Its called double dipping and its been around for years. Do I need to mention Star Wars? They are going to continue doing it also because they know it works. You have to know when to rent and know when to buy. This set is awesome and I truely doubt they will upconvert to blu ray, so now is the time to buy this set!",1203811200,,798,4.0251572327044025
2940845,5,B000VECAEE,"I decided I wanted to get this set, at least think about it.  Come to find a 4 star rating for this box set.  I was surprised, since I feel this is a 5 star series.  I thought, perhaps the set is defective or not done right or something, so I read the reviews, only to find out an otherwise 5 star average is brought down because of idiotic winers complaining about having bought the whole series for more already or something.  I'm glad to see some others who have noticed this nonsense, so I'll add my two cents as well...  If you purchased all of the series separately, I would think you would rate this 4 or 5 stars.  Giving it one star because you somehow feel cheated is idiotic and unjust.  That has nothing to do with a review of this set.

As others have pointed out, you pays your money, you takes your choice.  You got to watch these as they came out.  Are you sincerely surprised that the price is less now for the whole series?  Wake up!  Nearly every DVD I know of is most expensive when it comes out (excluding sales).  You see, in a free market society, when you sell something, you set your price at market value.  As demand subsides, you lower the price.  I think it's called free enterprise, and is the basis of American marketing.

I bought Star wars when it first came out, and now that it's been re-released as a box set, do I give it one star because it's less than I paid?  No!  That makes absoulutely no sense.  There's no reason this box set should be any less than 5 stars, so I had to add my 5 stars to counter these idiots.  What a bunch of winers!

2940872,5,B000VECAEE,"Seasons four and five are the peaks. Larry is the key to this show, and as good as Curb can get, George is a better Larry than Larry himself could ever be. There are probably 100 lines from Seinfeld that are instantly recognizable to millions...not that there's anything wrong with that.

I guess I've seen every episode of this show at least ten times. When my parents were dying and there was not a damn thing I could do about it, I watched my vhs copies over and over all night, every night, just to remind me that life was still worth laughing at. Sometimes I would get so sad I'd start crying and then something would happen on screen that was so classic that the tears would become tears of laughter as I thought of all the laughs we had as a family. That pretty much defines the power of art to me. For those moments I will always love everything about this show. It is the absurdity of life writ small.

The writing is so good, so tight, so funny! The real stars here are the writers, which is as it should be. At first I loved Kramer most, but as time went by I realized that it was all about George. Who hasn't been that egotistical and yet insecure at some point?  Making all of the characters selfish and egocentric and yet lovable says it all about modern America. We are a consumerist nightmare that refuses to step back and see how it is destroying itself and the rest of the world, all in the name of...what?

Still, you gotta laugh at it while trying to live your own version of a healthy, sane life. That these four goofballs can never quite get it right and yet still laugh so much is always heartening. The consistency is also amazing. There really isn't one bad show, just a few weak ones out of 180. Pretty fine batting average.

This is perhaps the best tv series that will ever exist. Not that that will keep Shakespeare and Da Vinci up at night! But it has made many of my nights most pleasant indeed.",1199491200,7,1926,4.28021978021978
2940873,5,B000VECAEE,"I mean, it has gotten old...OK then, where do I start??  I agree with the prior reviewer who compared Seinfeld to Monty Python...the show is brilliantly-written commentary on New York urban life (more than a bit Jewish, yes, but that only adds to the show's realness), and sublime, anarchic silliness.  Each of the show's 180 episodes are timeless slices of minutae (what the show referred to as ""nothing"") which were relatable at the time of broadcast, can be relatable today and will be 20 years from now, guaranteed.

The show's 4 main characters: Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine blended together perfectly, yet each was his/her own distinct person.  I loved how each episode had different subplots that crashed together in unexpected ways at show's end that was both hilarious and satisfying.  Each story was perfectly written and timeless that you can watch again and again without tiring of any...and there are 180 of these...pure gold, seriously.  I don't want to get into each episode because, otherwise, this review would be a ""coffee table book"", if you get my drift.

Now, I, like, many others here, started buying all the different seasons...I had the FIRST boxset, of seasons 1-3 (""the giftset you won't re-give/re-wrap"", I forgot the exact wording) with the replica of a script, deck of cool Seinfeld cards, and replicas of the diner's napkin dispenser and ketchup/mustard as salt shakers, all very cool, as well as Season 4 (sold by itself).  The reason why I didn't go further (I almost did) was because I couldn't find the SECOND boxset of seasons 5 & 6 with the replica ""Puffy Shirt"" for a reasonable price, and I didn't want to buy them separately because of the ""puffy shirt""...then I saw 7 & 8 come out separately, with no special box, then Season 9 was about to come out, so I inquired about the possibility of a complete series boxset, thinking, as the individual seasons were a bit pricey, it might not or would be too expensive...

Wahey!!!  One did, it looked cool (based on early pics), but the price was like almost $300, so I waited for sales...lo and behold, BestBuy's version was on sale $169.99 (I missed the sale, couldn't afford it that first week), and that FRIDGE REPLICA BOX!!!!  Wow, I couldn't resist, but it sold out everywhere.  What had me concerned was, was it BestBuy's standard but special packaging (like, would they ALL be like that, forever???) or was it strictly limited edition, gone by the new year, 2008???  Plus, once they got copies in, they would all go, with the holidays here, now gone???  So, when I had the cash, and I saw a copy at a BestBuy, I would pounce...I saw one, and had the cash, so I did...one of the best decisions I ever made...I made a slight sacrifice and I am recovering OK.

Since I had Seasons 1-4 before, I am watching them over, as a refresher course before I hit seasons 5-9, which I had never seen in full before...all awesome...I love the Fridge box, it just looks cool, standing upright, a nice attention-grabber...but the magnets don't work on it...so I'm keeping them inside the ""Coffee Table Book""...I love the book, full of cool trivia...the bonus disc was nice...cool for a 1-hour fun viewing.

All in all, just GREAT...tight, compact, space-saving, classy, worth the $179.99...I received a coupon a week after I bought this box, where I was able to get back the $22 I would have saved at the time...NICE!!!

One last thing, do what I did...sell your prior-watched seasons, and put the cash towards this box...that's what I did, and I kept the earlier extras, like the salt dispensers and deck of cards, so I have those too, NICE!!!",1199318400,,3621,4.740445859872612

I especially liked the episodes featuring George's parents and of course any appearance by Newman.  I think my favorite episode was the one in which George acts like he's a fifties high school stud and at the end Mr. Costanza asks Elaine if she wants a peice of him..it is so classic Seinfeld...that and the episode of an arrogant George getting a hairpiece, which Elaine for some reason hates; uh, she always hated it when George was happy.

2940903,5,B000VECAEE,"This box set (and by the way the TV show behind it) deserves every star it can possibly get. Offering us the long view on ""Seinfeld,"" from day one to day last, it allows us to see the scope of this greatest of all television shows, transmogrifying itself from Jerry-In-Red-Sweatpants at the beginning to Jerry-In-Lear-Jet at the end, like the old drawing of Darwin's ""ape-caveman-upright man"" progression.

And we see that the ape era wasn't so bad, after all; in fact, looked at as part of the show's evolution, the first two seasons, while the writers and actors were finding their voices, were the truest period of all for the show. Scrambling (sometimes raging) to find something, ANYthing to make a show about, Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld plumbed the best of their depths, offering a crash course in late-20th century survival of the un-fittest. Even at its 4th-season artistic zenith, the show would never be this real.

With the whole thing here in one place, we can even see that there are periods to this show as with any longterm work. The first period (Seasons 1-2) is the most grounded in reality; the second period (Seasons 3-5) is the most artistically rich, where the show has truly found its niche and explores it like a kid in a Toys R Us with an unlimited charge account; the third period (Seasons 6-7) is the wheels-are-off-the-wagon period, where anything goes as long as it's funny, no idea is too insane; the fourth and final period (Seasons 8-9) is just as anything-goes but it gets just a bit too manic at times, and you occasionally lose the suspension of disbelief you need to enjoy any work of fiction. Still, there is no ""bad"" season of this show, and no single episode is completely devoid of that brilliant ""Seinfeld"" wit that made this one of the most popular television shows of all time.

But scope is not all this set offers. It offers, simply, EVERYTHING. Confident that you have every episode at your fingertips, you can flip through the set for a show like you'd flip through the Bible for a quote (that's not going too far, is it?). Pick ""The Red Dot,"" then pick ""The Limo,"" then pick ""The Puffy Shirt,"" then pick ""The Finale."" On and on it goes, until you've seen so many you forget which ones you've seen and you start again. It's all there. And all the extras from all the box sets, from the feature-length documentary on the creation of the show to the great ""Inside Looks"" and the (frankly kind of useless) commentaries.

New for this box set is a Seinfeld Coffee Table Book, which is kind of the trivia-rich ""Notes About Nothing"" segments rolled into a single volume. Also included is an hour-long special recorded in 2007 featuring the original four cast members and Larry David watching and commenting on various clips from the show's nine-year run. It's fun and interesting, but it probably won't be watched more than once or twice. The ""Inside Looks"" are better for tidbits and insight into the show's workings. Finally, the packaging simply couldn't be better: tight, durable, compact. As always, they've cared enough to think of everything.

I love this show, I can watch it again and again, and it bugs me every time I hear people (even Seinfeld and co. themselves) talking about the characters as unredeemable or even vaguely sociopathic. The characters in ""Seinfeld"" are not anything like that. I think this misinterpretation, which is widespread even among the show's fans, is the fault of the actors and producers themselves, who have famously said that ""Seinfeld"" is a ""no-learning, no-hugging"" show. They themselves sold the characters as unredeemable; but the fact is that the 4-way friendship portrayed in this show is the strongest friendship ever portrayed on television. To me, that's what makes ""Seinfeld"" so great. What that show is REALLY about is people living in a massive, overwhelming urban environment (which, in our society of computers and malls and digital cable is everyone, even those living in small towns) who create and maintain a small outpost of human closeness, of love, in the face of that industrial anonymity we all feel closing in every day. That's certainly why I react to it, and why I've watched it so often. Not just the dialogue and the unorthodox structure of the show, which is brilliant, and not just the dead-on satire of modern American culture, but the relationships. ""Seinfeld"" is deeper than it ever sold itself.

All in all the complete box set is everything you could ask for, assuming you already like ""Seinfeld."" If you don't, come on, you're not plunking down two hundred bucks for this thing anyway.",1194912000,122,4606,4.802017654476671

2940906,5,B000VECAEE,"The whole set is very well designed and stylish. A must-have for Seinfeld fans and would be a great gift to those who love the show. Many 1-rating reviewers were just mad at the low price of this set. That's simply a pricing discrimination strategy used by the publisher. At least you enjoyed it way much earlier than the late buyer like me. The DVD of their first season came into the market in Nov 2004, three years ago. As for the set itself, it is definitely worth every penny, a great collection.",1194652800,3,501,4.397849462365591
2940907,5,B000VECAEE,"this is a very nice dvd set! i knew that i wanted the complete collection when i heard that it was going to be released. i already owned season 1-8, but this set is MUCH nicer, more compact, and even includes the exclusive hardcover book and bonus disc. thanks to eBay i was able to sell off my season sets and put the money toward buying this one. i don't know why this seems to be so expensive here, i got it at best buy, refrigerator and all, for $169.99 (plus tax). this fridge version is nice because it is basically a case to protect the case. i suggest buying this one at best buy while you can still find it. it's limited, so it's only going to go up in value. the magnets are kind of a neat bonus too.",1194652800,17,710,4.042553191489362

2940910,5,B000VECAEE,"What an amazing body of work... I think they did a pretty good job with this release, although the option to play the ""Notes on Nothing"" (really just line after line of green factoids splashed across the screen) feature didn't really add any eggs to an already nicely-filled basket. When all is said and done it's the genius of the actors and writers that shines through - as it should be! By the way... I bought my set at Best Buy for $169.95. It was, by far, the ""best buy"".",1194393600,3,476,4.3
2940931,5,B000VECAEE,"Man, I like to get things in one fell swoop, and this is the answer I was looking for.  Like the complete Far Side, or the complete Calvin & Hobbes.  Oh sure, I could be a blithering fanboy and talk about how ""true fans"" bought the DVDs season by season, and then I could cry about how a business is looking to maximize its profits, but I'm not a cry-baby.  Someday they'll probably release a complete Simpsons, but I won't care because after season 10 that show became a huge steaming turd.  But this is a great deal.  Buy it if you don't have all the other DVDs, and if you DO have the other DVDs, quit crying about it.  Wah!  Sony is evil!  I will cleverly replace the ""S"" in their name with a dollar sign!",1194393600,4,709,4.124087591240876
2940932,4,B000VECAEE,"The DVDs are great. They have everything you would expect and everything the other reviewers have noted. So, I won't badger this review with a ton of repeated information.

There is one thing to note. This set is advertised with the mythical Coffee Table Book that Kramer created that becomes its own coffee table. The book included in the package DOES NOT become a coffee table. They could have/should have added legs that can fold out, like Kramer's book did.

Otherwise, this a fantastic product!",1194307200,12,499,4.858823529411764
2940933,5,B000VECAEE,"I love the show and love the DVD's. Any one that is a Seinfeld fan then you need to get this.
I bought all the single season DVD's and I got this for all the extras.
You buy the DVD's because you like the program or movie. If later it gets cheaper don't wine about it. What you go and wine to your car dealership because your car looses $4,000 just pulling it off the lot. You people remind me of the people that spent days standing out in front of the Apple store to get an iPhone and are now complaining because they dropped the price. Stop wine'ing if you don't like the show then don't buy it. What you going to wine in a few years when they come out with like a anniversary special edition too and it has even more special features.
I wasn't going to write a review but all of the people that gave this one star are not doing it because they didn't like something of it. They are just upset and gave it a single star because they paid $35 or what not per a season episode DVD.",1194307200,5,981,4.010204081632653
2940934,4,B000VECAEE,"I bought the Seinfeld box set, but I have to say the box itself is cheaply made. It looks like it might fall apart from everyday handling and any grease/sweat/fingerprints will smudge the outer carton. You would think for the money spent that it would be leather-bound.

2940935,5,B000VECAEE,"I just purchased this new Complete Series box Set and it is awesome and very well made.  I decided to wait because I knew that, eventually, a ""Complete Box Set"" was going to be released.  It was inevitable that this was going to come out because of how HUGE Seinfeld was and still is.  Only instead of me having 8 separate box sets cluttering my bookcase, I have one, nice Collector set taking up one quarter of the space. This set is about the thickness of a Telephone Directory and about as tall as one as well. It comes in a hard case with 3 separate slots, 2 for the DVD's and 1 for a very nice Hardcover ""Coffee Table Book"" the gives you a brief description of every episode and small facts about each episode.  It also comes with a bonus DVd on the back cover of the book.  The Dvd sets are split into 2 Smaller books that are also very well made with Seasons 1 thru 5 in one book and Seasons 6 thru 9 in the other book  This set was very well worth it for me to get as a huge Seinfeld fan and not to mention the bargain price of $175 Dollars I paid for it as opposed to the original $280 suggested retail price.  If I would have bought these separate, it would have cost me over 350 Dollars, so I'm very happy I waited.  If you are a Seinfeld fan, casual or not, I highly recommend this set to everyone, especially if you never purchased the prior sets before.  This would also make a great gift for the upcoming holidays.",1194307200,8,1429,4.111510791366906
2940936,5,B000VECAEE,"yes, i am a HUGE fan of the show, you might say a bit obsessed with it, and once season 7 came out, and then season 8 was released, i kind of figured they would eventually release an entire series set. along the way i have purchased each individual seasons and i watch them rather frequently, and they sit proudly on my DVD shelf along with many movies and a few other t.v. show DVDs. the only thing i didn't do was pay full price for any of the individual seasons. i either found them on sale somewhere or picked up a few used ones. i don't think i paid over $30.00 for any of them. currently, i only need season 3 and of course, season 9, which i might just skip and buy the series box set which i could not be more excited about. they might release all the extras and the book seperately one day, they might not, but i want all those items, i want the entire series in one, neat little box, that again...will sit proudly on my DVD shelf. i don't feel it's a rip off at all. the price for this set is a steal in my opinion, and if you're an honest to god, true fan of the show...maybe borderline psycho about it like i am, then this is a very welcome addition to your collection. i also have every available season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, and will continue to buy them as they become available, and when L.D. decides to put the kibosh on that show, and if they release a series box set, i'll be first in line to buy that as well.

There are you happy?  Clearly every big tv show releases the seasons first, then the whole series.

STOP WHINING.  You got to watch each season years ago.  That's what you paid for.  Just like Getting a plasma tv 5 years ago, you got it before everyone, you enjoyed it, you PAID for it.

Are you upset now that TVs have gone down in price?  That's how it works and really, shame on YOU.  You should have paid attention to life and noticed this happens.  You should have made a choice when Season 1 came out.  Do i enjoy it now and not get the Big Box Set in 10 years?  Yes, i will enjoy it now and not complain later when there is an extra disc-

 (that will probably be released separately!!!!!, they are in this to make as much money as possible after all.)

So please.  You got to enjoy it, be happy now.

Maybe I understand some of the people out there who feel betrayed, but, as some others have said, you've chosen to buy or not to buy.

You bought the dvds early and that was your choice knowing this would come out once they were all released. Every single TV show to come out on dvd has done this. You release each season individually then once they are done you do a box set. How many of you people were really ignorant enough to not see this happen? Get some common sense and stop complaining about something you knew would happen. Punishing the ""true fans""? Why? It was your choice to wait. There was no way they would release this box set years ago, I guess because they couldn't ""trick"" you people to buy the individual sets rather then actually thinking and waiting to buy the box set.",1193961600,23,800,4.375838926174497

Look if you bought them you have been enjoying them this box set isn't even out yet so you have had these dvds for a while probably so you shouldnt be too upset. I am glad they put it all together for people that waited but who knows I might not buy this one either because then I would be mad when they re release all these 32 dvds into like 10 Blu Ray discs. I think people should just accept new versions of things yes I know it sucks my computer gets outdated ever few years but look enjoy it while it lasts.

The complete series DVD came with some wonderful bonus items only found in that set. Anyone care to guess if the same thing will happen with The Sapranos or Deadwood?

People this is what they do. Like or not, buy it or not, buy this or never buy anything again, who really cares, but learn your lessons and move on.

For me I rented them from Netflix and am thrilled to get this brilliant set that speaks to the love, care and effort that Jerry and David clearly have for this show.

As noted before and by others, if you don't like it so be it, but for a true fan who can afford it, the extra goodies clearly make this worthwhile.

2940953,5,B000VECAEE,"THIS IS NOT A REVIEW ON THE PRODUCT ITSELF. BUT 5 STARS INITIALLY FOR AN AWESOME, INCREDIBLE SITCOM. I obviously know this post will not be helping any individual, but I think it's important to pose the question. :)

Know that this is a premature question, but for those who actually do pick up the Seinfeld boxset when it comes out on 11/06/07, please answer. Appreciative. Please use Amazon's ""COMMENT"" function under this post to answer. THANKS.

I would like to know whether the Seinfeld Boxset DVDs will be housed in flimsy sleeve or cardboard protectors, which in fact do not do the job of protecting DVDs from surface scratches all that well.

Anytime two objects slide across each other, friction automatically creates microscopic ""scratches"" even if they're not heavily noticeable to the naked eye. However, they can be noticeable if you actually use the disk often. Seinfeld is classic memorable TV, and I can imagine re-watching the entire series many, many times over.

Normal plastic DVD cases found with individual boxset always seem to provide better protection to each disk because you are ""separating"" the disk from the case holder in a vertical manner without having to slide the disk back and forth from potential scratch inducing flimsy sleeves.

Scratches automatically devalues the DVD product. I have the first two Seinfeld volumes (so technically season 1, 2, and 3). I like to keep my DVDs scratch free, and if the COMPLETE SERIES boxset comes equipped with flimsy sleeve protectors, I might have to pass and pick up the individual sets instead.",1193788800,4,1570,4.977099236641221

As someone else said, if you want this set, purchase it and sell your other DVD's.

NO! of course not. i knew that in about 5 years they would have them all neatly packaged into one boxed set. and here it is, as i predicted last year, just in time for the holidays. i can't believe you people who are pissed off because ""the studios have done it again."" EVERY series has a boxed set in the end. and it's usually really cool (ie. six feet under with the grass and all that). so just wait. and if you can't wait and want to buy them one by one, then i guess you don't need to buy a boxed set now do you? BUT you also got all those fun little extras like the puffy shirt and the script and all that which i don't think come with this boxed set. so look at it that way. and yea you spent a lot on those individual ones, but just sell them back if you must. you'll make enough to buy this set. seriously people, it's not the end of the world and if you are paying ANY attention to the way tv shows are released on dvd, you would have realized ages ago that this was going to happen. that this boxed set (in all this beautiful glory) was coming down the line. i can't wait til it goes on sale. i've been waiting many years for this...",1193443200,6,1267,3.9725490196078432

Now my complaints. I was one of those loyal fans who bought the previous seasons as they were released. I spent over $120.00 in the collector's edition from season 1-3. And bought season 4 and 5 seperately. And I stopped because of economic reason (but was tempted to buy them as they were released).But all in all I ended spending nealy $200 in five seasons, whereas this new collection will cost at least the same price, and will include all nine seasons. I knew this was going to happen. I feel now as if I was robbed the last few years. What kind of world are we living?

I'll probably end up selling seasons four and five and keep the collector's edition. Maybe I won't buy it at all. But I have learned my lesson. That's one of the reason I have never bought a Smallville DVD.

Often times you can make enough money selling the sets that you bought as they were released that you can pick up the complete set essentially for free.  In the case of Buffy I only sold the five seasons I owned and was able to pick up the complete series and still had some change left over to pick up firefly.
