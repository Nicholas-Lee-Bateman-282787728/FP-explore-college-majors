5080334,5,B007F5M91Q,"I consider myself a true fan of street documentaries but Frank Matthews is the man of all the rags to riches strories his is the best! Not because he sold the most dope, or had the most women, or committed the most murders but because HE GOT AWAY! I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it but if you like the tales of the street this one is for you!  Mr. Matthews did it like it's supposed to be done and probably won't ever be done again!

5080337,5,B007F5M91Q,"As corrupt as the judicial system is from top to bottom it was refreshing, even inspiring, to learn about one who ""beat"" the system and got away. I don't condone what he did, but I respect the way he did it.",1498521600,,207,4.073170731707317

5080369,5,B007F5M91Q,"I love a good documentary about anything of the past. This was no different. I had never heard of or knew anything about Frank Matthews, but his story was good.

5080372,4,B007F5M91Q,"Matthews might well be the biggest enigma in the past 50-years of drug related crime.  It's interesting how he managed to survive so many enemies including the NY Mafia.  This isn't a spit and polished CBS 60-Minutes expose.  It has a gritty feel.  Gritty as in real folks whose paths were somehow crossed to Matthews regardless of which side of right and wrong they were on.  The man was a violent criminal no doubt, but he dressed it with the success of a consummate businessman making him quite unique.  This part is made clear, maybe too much, through repeated short interviews which basically tell the same.  The big question is how when he got tipped off he ran never to be seen again.  More who were involved with the story think he may still be alive than dead and therefore still successfully on the run...or living like royalty albeit secretly.  An interesting story.",1473897600,,877,4.6797385620915035

5080425,5,B007F5M91Q,"Great documentary on the forgotten Drug Kingpin. Forget about Frank Lucas & Nicky Barnes (because much of what you here about them is lies anyway), Frank Matthews was the Man when it came to heroin in the late 60's and early 70's. Keep in mind that being ""the Man"" in this context means helping spread the plague of heroin across the US in this era.
  The documentary does an excellent job tracing Matthews rise in the game and his organizations massive nationwide reach. This is done through interviews with people from his hometown in NC, associates in the drug trade and law enforcement personnel. Throughout it becomes clear that Frank Matthews was in a league all by himself.
  There is also a good amount of time put into Frank's disappearance and the subsequent manhunt, which is still ongoing.
  I would suggest checking out Ron Chepesiuk's Crimebeat podcast of 4-14-2014 where he does a followup on the disappearance.
  So if you are looking to get beyond the hype of ""American Gangster"" and ""Mr Untouchable"" and want to learn about the real Big Man of the Black Caesar/Superfly era check this out.",1411344000,2,1107,4.7894736842105265

5080431,3,B007F5M91Q,"This is not a bad documentary overall, but the narrator, ""Al Profit"", made me physically cringe. There's something sleazy and douchey about him that totally distracted me from the story. Just picture Ziggy from The Wire narrating a film. You can tell that Mr. Profit is devastated that he can't be part of the history and gangster culture that he describes in the film. A passion for crime stories is a good thing (after all, without him this documentary wouldn't exist), but really he needs stay out of the way and let the story tell itself.",1404518400,,542,4.65625

5080434,5,B007F5M91Q,"I loved this documentary simply because it showed how my my people, people of colored thrived back in the day. I never knew how booming Durham, NC was until this documentary. I can easily compare Frank Mathews to Griselda Blanco if you disagree your highly mistaken. Coming from a daughter who's dad was quiet the hustler back in the day, never snitched, & did his fed time like a real man, this is definitely a man to look up; pay homage to the people who came before you and paved the way.",1397001600,,491,4.3478260869565215
5080435,3,B007F5M91Q,I enioyed The Frank Matthews Story but it was to me just a lot of put together information from multiple sources and interviews with some of his friends and business associates. It was VERY well put together but I'm glad that I didn't buy the dvd and just paid for the standard download for half the money. It wasn't what I expected but I wasn't TOTALLY disappointed.,1394582400,,367,4.492537313432836
5080436,4,B007F5M91Q,It was amazing to know that men of color had a lot of influence in the drug trade. But unfortunately it was a sad ending that was never really had an ending.,1393891200,,157,3.9375

5080438,5,B007F5M91Q,Documentary was well put together. The Frank Mathews story brought Interesting perspectives from various sides.  The pace of the story never dragged and the presentation was on point. I recommend watching  The Frank Mathews Story!,1392249600,,230,5.542857142857143

5080440,3,B007F5M91Q,"The narrator's voice is irritating and he sounds like one of those people who tries too hard to be cool . If he wasn't in it, the film would have been excellent..but he ruined it..",1390694400,2,180,4.171428571428572
5080441,4,B007F5M91Q,"I never even heard of Frank Matthews, but the film was very informative and interesting. There was a wide range of interviews presented, which made for some great story-telling. I wonder if Frank Matthews saw the film if he would agree!",1387324800,,236,4.780487804878049

5080443,4,B007F5M91Q,"This is a good story although the language may be too rough for some.  I lived in this world years ago and it is a true reflection of the very, hard, damaging existence that drugs can bring to your life.  I lost many family members, friends to this awful addiction.  I am so Blessed to be alive today with no existing side effects left.  If parents are brave enough to watch this video, they can really see what drugs do to you and they can then share it with their family.  Though the language is rough it is Very Realistic.",1386115200,3,525,4.21
5080444,4,B007F5M91Q,"This was a very detailed study of a major player in the 60s 70s drug trade who went virtually unknown by the general public.  It is a very amazing story of someone who came from virtual obscurity, to rise to become a master of the drug trade to the very end.  And like most traditional gangsters, he knew how to stay off the radar , but unlike most, he knew how to cut his losses and disappear.  This video was put together very well with fresh information and interviews from those who knew him personally from both sides of the law.",1384646400,2,534,4.267326732673268
5080445,1,B007F5M91Q,"Did not like this, but because I'm originally from Harlem, I was curious.  It was heavily narrated and not worth the time.  However, it did tell this gangster's story.",1384473600,,167,4.724137931034483
5080446,5,B007F5M91Q,Al Profit made a wonderful film. He is the master at making crime documentaries. Frank Matthews was one bad dude and this film really tells it all. If you like crime docs you'll enjoy this film.  What do you think happened to Frank?,1380067200,4,232,4.395348837209302
5080447,5,B007F5M91Q,"This is a must-read, for anyone who is familiar with Frank's story. I mean Nicky Barnes was big but this guy he was one of the biggest and he certainly puts that mental midget Frank Lucas to shame Hollywood ran off and told the Frank Lucas story without getting their facts straight. Anyone in the know, knows Shorty was the real brains Frank was nothing but a big dumb bully who could barely tie shoes and he did rat out every single person that he ever dealt with you can watch the documentary, Sgts. smack by a dude name Atkins and he'll give you the real deal. But let's stay on point here and talk about just how come it took so long for someone to make a documentary and write a book about this guy and his disappearance is he dead, or is he living in Venezuela, nobody really knows but you better believe somehow someway somebody got their hands on all that alleged money maybe that's why nobody was looking real hard for him. Look how long it took him to find Whitey Bulger you think that was an accident Frank wasn't found because somebody didn't want Frank to be found read the book it's the bomb respectfully Johnny Irish",1379635200,7,1132,4.34433962264151
5080448,5,B007F5M91Q,"Eye opening story of a tragic and brilliant, little-known drug kingpin who still remains a mystery. Thorough and engaging...this is how a documentary should be done.",1379548800,3,165,5.384615384615385
5080449,5,B007F5M91Q,"Frank Matthews had a talent for selling his product. Most of all his communication & leadership skills had to be extraordinary in order to control such a vast market place. To bad it was used to sell a product that helped set his people back decades by getting them hooked on dope. Frank was in a class of his own. The Italian gangsters stopped at nothing to see Frank Matthews demise. In today's world we call that ""straight up player hating"". When Frank bought that house on Toot Hill, that was the beginning of the end. The Italians that lived on Toot Hill with Frank feared this Black man ""TRUST ME"" when I say it. Just like Black folks are feared in the work place, the sports gridiron, or the Corporate business world. Feared because deep down inside they all know we possess the talent and ability to do it better than anyone else can....and that's just one of the things they fear the most about Black folks....it's what they feared in Frank Matthews, buy the DVD!",1378944000,,972,4.497175141242938
5080450,4,B007F5M91Q,"Born in 1944 in Durham, North Carolina, Matthews left his hometown when he was a teenager, going first to Philadelphia and then to New York City. By the early 1970 s, Frank Matthews had become America's biggest drug kingpin. His organization, headquartered in Brooklyn, stretched across more than 20 states, and he became the only Black gangster to establish direct ties to the French Connection heroin pipeline.",1376352000,3,412,5.164179104477612
5080451,5,B007F5M91Q,"This documentary was well done, and provides an in depth look into Frank Matthews and who he really was.  I own this documentary on DVD, and am happy to refer people to it.",1376265600,,172,4.212121212121212
5080452,4,B007F5M91Q,"I wasn't familiar with Frank Matthews before, but after viewing this documentary I have to say his case is certainly an interesting one.  Getting away with an estimated 25 million after a career of major drug dealing is quite an achievment (in a reversed values sort of way).  My guess is that he changed his appearance and afterwards died at some point or he would have been arrested by now.  If he's ever caught however, his trial would be quite a spectacle.  This documentary is well worth your viewing time if you like urban history.",1375315200,,537,4.621052631578947
5080453,5,B007F5M91Q,"This is the best crime documentary I've ever seen! It sets many misconceptions perpetuated by ""American Gangster"" straight. This was a much more fascinating story as well because it seems like he got away with it. Frank Mathews was brilliant and found great success in a field where the odds were against him. Check it out... You won't be disappointed!",1374796800,6,352,4.883333333333334
5080454,1,B007F5M91Q,"This is the type of a DVD you might want to rent oppose to buying.
Mr. Matthews, obviously a smart man however the told story via the DVD is terrible.
Frank Matthews was a better criminal than Frank Lucus? This is what I got thanks to the producers of this poorly put together crock.
Al profit usually create pretty decent DVD's concerning criminals. I will fogive him for this one.",1371081600,,382,4.4714285714285715
5080455,3,B007F5M91Q,"How can anybody call this thug smart. How smart do you have to be to sell drugs.  A twelve year old can sell drugs to an addict.  If Matthews was so smart,he should have opened an ice cream parlor chain. He'd probably still be around to talk about his business ventures.
Matthews was more Lucky than smart. The smart guys are the LE officers who shut his operation down. Many lives were destroyed as a result of Matthews Entrepreneur exploits. Did he escape or was he silenced by his benefactors. We may never know.",1370995200,,515,4.468085106382978
