2945130,1,B000VLLYGC,"Besides the fact that this movie resembles a current movie and novel exceptionally closely this movie is technically flawed and about as interesting as paint drying. I picked it up because I happen to love B movies and Mark Dacascos and was hoping it would be entertaining. Save your time and watch a Sam Rami movie and/or read/watch I am Legend. Both have what it takes to make a memorable and enjoyable movie experience. Hey.... I wanted it to be good or at least interesting.

PS- The director vehemently denies ever have read OR seen/heard about .I Am Legend'. Please beware the imdb reviews unless you want to read the one guy who played ONE ZOMBIE in the movie (which is supposed to be another, completely different zombie each time) and the director defend the originality of the movie and Mark Dacascos being involved in the filming because he is a friend of the director. While they (doubtlessly) have other talents- it's kind of sad they have so much time to troll the forums to defend this rather lackluster rip-off film.",1201392000,,1032,4.701657458563536

Having seen 2 other Asylum productions, ""Transmorphers"" and ""Universal Soldiers"" I was prepared for anything. Transmorphers was okay despite a lot of issues with its production values, while Universal Soldiers was quite horrible. ""I am Omega"" is the slickest of the 3 Asylum films I have seen to date. Its setting is really ideal for a low budget film like this as there aren't any expensive sets needed and the effects are all done for the most part with make-up and good old fashioned stuntwork. The sparse dialogue also suits the film well as it hides a great deal of bad acting. I have good news for this Asylum picture ""Not Terrible!""",1199404800,2,807,4.81294964028777

Its GREAT to have Mark D. in a Theasylum pic.
 This rendition has a new edge and Yet pays tribute to Charleton Heston and his version from the `70's.
 Mark's character has been by himself since the zombies took over the open areas of Metro. Humans re-emerge in the shape of vigilantes and a girl with the cure.
 Mark has a plan to sanitize Metro with multiple bombs,Gives film a urgency.
This film doesn't seem like most from Griff Furst,It's a major step in a good way.
Geoff Meed who also wrote the script has some great moments on screen, Duh !

2945137,3,B000VLLYGC,"Richard Matheson's post-apocalyptic tale of a society overrun by the monstrous victims of a deadly illness has been made into movies several times now, and this Asylum adaptation takes its title from 2 past adaptations, Omega Man and I am Legend. The lone hero scientist here is played by under-appreciated martial arts star Mark Dacascos, who uses as many kicks and machete strikes as gunshots to dispatch the cannibal undead.

These direct-to-video sci-fi films tend to follow a pretty predictable formula, so I'll break this review down into its constituent parts:

Lone Token Celebrity:
Mark Dacascos. His capacity for chop-sockey should by all rights have made him generation Y's Jean-Claud Van Damme, but a lack of big ticket US exposure and the old Hollywood blessing/curse of being vaguely ethnic have doomed him to being a poor man's Dwayne Johnson. It's too bad because he's an awesome performer.

Lesson About Man's Hubris:
Even after the fall of society man is the greatest monster, but unlike in Heston's film man is not the CREATOR of the monsters, nor are the monsters here feeling, sympathetic creatures as they are in that film.

Carnage:
Good while it lasts, but there's not much. A whole city explodes at the end, but it's not very well done (and it would be foolish of you to expect it would be).

Awful Effects:
Just average zombie gore, with some bad explosions at the finish. If you consider sepia tinting an effect, well, it's in full force and wears out its welcome fast.

Romantic Subplot:
Boy meets girl over video chat, and they go on the lam from zombies. It's like You've Got Mail, really.

Big Action Truck:
Various cars, including a conveniently named Oldsmobile Omega. To be fair though, classic Oldsmobiles were truck-sized.

Predictable rote, and done many times before, not even Mark Dacascos can save this plodding horror film from the shambling doom of living death. Also if everyone is dead or monsters, how does he get power and water for his fridge ice maker?",1360195200,,2000,4.896449704142012

End of story. If you want to see a good movie with real horror or suffering, watch Martyrs or Inside. You'll thank me and so will your wallet.",1354147200,,663,4.228346456692913
2945139,2,B000VLLYGC,"Disclaimer:  I viewed this film as a streaming rental and as such cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the individual disc.  My review is concerned with the entertanment value of the film only.

The relative merits of a film such as I AM OMEGA, starring Mark Dacascos and produced by Asylum Home Entertainment, can sometimes be obscured by previous experience with the actors and production company involved, as well as with the films that provided the 'inspiration' for the movie in question.  I AM OMEGA is another in a long list of films by Asylum designed to ride on the coattails of a blockbuster release - in this case Will Smith's I AM LEGEND - and evidently do so on a much smaller budget.  The merely cynical might say Asylum is looking to sponge off the hype and popularity of the better advertised (and probably better in all respects) film, although those given to more charitable opinions could conceivably claim that films such as I AM OMEGA provide genre fans who can't get enough of the concept more grist for the mill, so to speak.

I suppose I'm a mixture - I have a pretty good idea of what Asylum's business model aspires to, yet I'm also genre junkie who has watched a lot of B-grade (or Z) material over the years and keeps going back for more.  That's what makes this one such a great rental - the only cost was the time involved.  And really, what are we talking about here?  Kurosawa?  Goddard?  Herzog?  No, we are not.  Those who are uninitiated into the joys of zombie films probably only see the thinnest of margins between a classic such as Fulci's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie/dp/B005CU5OEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie</a>&nbsp;or Romero's work and a film like I AM OMEGA.  And, while I can appreciate that opinion, for myself, I think there are distinctions - in relation to other movies of the same kind, I AM OMEGA stacks up somewhere south of good, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its charms.

This is one of those two-star films that I liked.  Mark Dacascos, known for his appearances on Iron Chef and Hawaii Five-O, is Renchard, a survivor of an unexplained apocalyptical plague of...well, I'm not sure what they are because it's never explained.  For convenience, I think you could call them plague infected humans who would like to eat you - since the film bears so many other similarities to I AM LEGEND, we might as well borrow that description too.  Fearing that he is the last normal human alive, he uses his skills learned in the military to survive and also to plan the destruction of the city, thereby wiping out the hive of infected humans.  But the best laid schemes gang aft agley, as they say, and Renchard receives a signal from a lone woman trapped inside the city.  Bearing an uncanny resemblance to his late wife, Renchard at first has trouble accepting whether she is real or merely a figment of his imagination.

But the plot thickens when two former recon Marines show up at his front door.  Having intercepted the transmissions between the girl and Renchard, they inform him that they are from a stronghold of survivors, and the girl is somehow immune to the virus - the hope of mankind.  They need him to show them how to sneak into the city, and proceed to convince him - by using the strongest terms available - to help them retrieve the girl.  But the question on every viewers mind at this point has to be, 'What do they REALLY want her for?'

Well, as I said, I kinda sorta liked the film, but make no mistake, it's still a two-star effort, and even that may be generous.  First of all, there are plot holes in this one you could throw a plague-infected human through (like where is all the electricity or internet signal coming from, or just how far CAN you push a car with a bullet in each arm and one in the leg); and I think that it's also fairly obvious that if your main star is known for his martial arts skills, then there is going to be a large part of the film where he is going to use roubndhouse kicks and nunchuks while fighting off the legions of the...whatevers, no matter how ridiculous that seems when you have a machine gun available.  My suggestion would be not to get wrapped up in such points - like why our heroes would choose a convertable to ride through city streets infested with superhuman plague victims.  It seems pretty self-evident that there's no other way to have really cool scenes of fighting zombies out of a convertable if they don't.  The larger point is, as a zombie junkie, do we REALLY need all the details spelled out for us in a logical, scientifically reasonable way?  No, not really, or at least I don't all the time.  What makes a good zombie film anyway?  I mean, we're begining from a ludicrous premise anyway, so to my mind, I want to indulge in the vicarious fantasy of surviving in such a world.  Do the minds behind I AM OMEGA create enough tension in that regard that I'm interested enought to follow along? - ahhhh, I don't know.  Sorta.

I AM OMEGA follows the conventions of the genre well enough so that I can fill in any of the blanks that I want to (or not) however I choose.  And because my expectations for I AM OMEGA were almost as low as for any Michael Bay film, I just chose to overlook what I couldn't reconcile with reality, and I ended up satisfied.  I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone though - what would be the point?  If you don't like zombie films to begin with, without a doubt you won't like this one, and if you're a zombie junkie like I am, you've already watched it.  Or you've been tempted to - you know you have.  Might as well go ahead and get it over with.",1338595200,,5683,4.538763493621198

2945141,3,B000VLLYGC,"I've seen this movie now about two and a half times. The 1/2 time was when I caught just part of it on tv. I can watch this from start to finish, comparing it with the three other movies that it hopes to join: The Last Man on Earth, The Omega Man and I am Legend.

On a scale of greatness I rank the movies like this:

1) Omega Man------------------ the perennial classic, if not the first.
2) I Am Legend---------------- the big money modern remake of two movies.
3) The Last Man on Earth------ the idea is fleshed out. The movie plods, Vincent Price was no action hero.
4) I Am Omega----------------- modern B Movie homage to three other movies.

I think ""I Am Omega"" is a good title. I think the lead actor is pretty good, even if his character is a bit wacky. I think the martial arts idea was a good one, even if it wasn't employed well. Mostly the character just practices. As for the ""dead or diseased mutants"", yes it's actors in zip up suits but it still works. The mutants in this movie are muscular and they look reptilian. These mutants come out in the day which is new to the series of movies. The sun does not burn these mutants. These mutants may or may not need to sleep in the day.

As for the movie, there is little plot. There is a flashback of the main character watching the news, or was it a radio broadcast, but some crisis is being broadcast. This viewer has no real idea why the world went to hell. All this viewer knows is that the main character wants to blow up the city. He travels in the sewer to plant explosives so he can blow up natural gas lines.

The movie is pretty good when ""Omega"" is trying to escape the city. Omega fights off zombies in the parking garage. The rescued girl takes off; Omega rejoins her. They meet up with another character, a two faced bad guy who shoots the good guy and takes off with the girl. The girl has the cure in her blood. Omega later fights the bad guy, white from blood loss, he stands on what should be broken bones and kills the bad guy. The two escape in a very nice car. Omega does not DIE at the end of this movie, which is NICE for a change. The End.

The movie presents some new elements, zombies in the day, Mr. Omega does not have to DIE at the end of the movie. The ZOMBIES get blown up for a change. Humanity makes progress. This movie really needed a happy ending because it didn't have a whole lot going for it. The lead character Mr. Omega was pretty cool, athletic, quirky, too trusting, too heroic for his own good. And finally, it's strange how the internet still worked after the world went to hell and all. Not sure how it works, but it worked for Omega and the girl with the special blood.

This movie is good for the new ideas alone. I just hope they keep remaking this movie. The movies have never been literal adaptions of the book, but that's ok because the book is little dark, a bit crude/nasty, and a bit dark and dumb.",1317427200,,2916,4.196428571428571

2945143,4,B000VLLYGC,"Yes, this is an Asylum movie.  However, it is entertaining and more gritty than many horror movies.

The Good
(1) The female lead is not helpless and is, in fact, more stable and resilient than the hero.
(2) The hero is well-versed in killing zombies.  For example, he cleans the blood from himself and his weapons to avoid contamination.
(3) The zombies are real and not CGI.
(4) The fight scenes are fast-paced and well-shot.
(5) Hungry zombies are hungry, crazy humans are crazy, the dead city is dead.  The movie is consistent and does not give any unrealistic miracles or surprises.
(6) The DVD is cheap.

The Bad
(1) The movie gives no explanation of how and why the power grid and Internet are still running.
(2) The hero's house does look a bit insecure, but a secure house would look extremely boring.
(3) The DVD has no extras.

""I Am Omega"" is not a flashy blockbuster, but it is a good flick.",1294012800,5,904,4.4817073170731705
2945144,3,B000VLLYGC,"Well now Asylum's really made a mess of things.

See, it's very easy to brush off Asylum's mockbuster-style movies as drek. This is why it's become something of a hobby for reviewers to bash the studio for whatever it produces.  The very nature of these quickly-produced movies guarantees they will be derivative films. And for the most part, this criticism is well-earned.

Until I Am Omega came along.  I Am Omega is a mockbuster of Will Smith's I Am Legend (2007), which was a remake of The Omega Man (1971), which was a remake of The Last Man on Earth (1964), which was based on the book I Am Legend by Richard Matheson that also happened to inspired Night of the Living Dead (1968). Nobody is in a position to call I Am Omega derivative.

The fact that I Am Legend inspired Night of the Living Dead is a clue to I Am Omega's interpretation, which replaces the vampire-like mutants with plain old zombies. Director Griff Furst knows how to film a shot, pace a scene, and cut away before it becomes too obvious that there isn't much of a special effects budget.

I Am Omega's leading man is Renchard (Mark Dacascos).  Dacascos is a martial artist first, actor second, but he manages to convincingly carry scenes that are essentially one man slowly going insane in the home where his wife and child were eaten by zombies.  Renchard's lonely world is rocked when he receives a video chat request from a woman (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) who is the spitting image of his dead wife.  Shortly thereafter, two other survivors, Vincent (Geoff Meed) and Mike (Ryan Lloyd) insist Renchard lead the way through the sewers to the missing girl.  She carries the cure to the zombie plague within her.  There's just one problem - Renchard's been working on setting charges through the city to blow up the ""zombie hive"" and end their scourge once and for all.

The zombies and the damsel in distress are incidental.  The real stars are Meed, who infuses his villain with both insanity and redneck menace.  Dacascos works hard to give Renchard a wide range of emotions.  He may not be the best actor, but he gives it his all here.

At heart, this is a movie about a guy who fights zombies with nunchucks.  But it is also a surprisingly tense, poignant, and occasionally funny film that rises above its B-movie material by embracing it.  Post-apocalyptic zombie killing has become so common a trope that nearly any movie treading the same ground borders on parody.  But I Am Omega is a homage to the ridiculousness that is a zombie plague.  If it occasionally borders on the completely nonsensical, complete with odd time shifts and characters surviving grievous wounds...the zombies are there to remind us of the perils of nitpicking.

And that's too bad for Asylum.  It means they can make a decent movie if they so choose.  They've just raised a very low bar.  Here's hoping we see more I Am Omegas and less Legions of the Dead in the future.",1288396800,5,2926,4.625968992248062
2945145,4,B000VLLYGC,"No, it does not compare with I am legend, but this film is enjoyable none the less and combines 2 very unique genres: Zombies and Martial Arts!  What's not to like?  Sit back and enjoy...especially the fight scene with the Nonchuks.  I'm sure this is a first for zombie flicks!",1285459200,,277,4.5
2945146,3,B000VLLYGC,"There is some light baggage associated with I Am Omega (2007), a direct to video feature produced by The Asylum, which was released just prior to the opening of the film I Am Legend (2007), supposedly in an attempt to cash in on the buzz generated by Will Smith's special effects heavy blockbuster.  It would be difficult to confuse the two films, as in comparison I Am Omega is a much more modest effort.

Writer Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend, is perhaps his most influential work.  The story about a post-apocalyptic world, where all of mankind except for one man, have become vampire like creatures, was first adapted for the screen in The Last Man on Earth (1964) starring Vincent Price, followed by The Omega Man (1971) starring Charlton Heston.  Matheson's work is also cited by George Romero as an influence on the zombie genre.

Matheson's novel may not be officially credited as a source, but I Am Omega clearly borrows heavily from it.  Renchard (Mark Dacascos) believes he is the last survivor of a terrible virus that has transformed mankind into deadly zombies.  Living alone in a rural area, he spends his days killing zombies, and planting explosive charges on natural gas lines, in preparation for blowing up what is left of civilization.  Fortunately electricity is still available and somehow the internet is still functional, as one night Renchard is knocked on his ass, when he is contacted online by a woman named Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins).

Via webcam, Brianna says that there are other survivors at a place called Antioch, and that she is trapped in a nearby city.  Renchard refuses her request to come and rescue her, but later after two men armed with guns blow up his home, Renchard is coerced into making the trip into the city.  Vincent (Jeff Meed), and Mike (Ryan Lloyd), say that they are from Antioch, and need Brianna because she has immunity to the virus.  Entering the city through sewer tunnels, Renchard manages to locate Brianna, but must get clear of the city fast, before his timed explosive charges detonate.

The story may be derivative, but it generally moves at a quick pace, and occasionally generates real suspense and tension.  The dynamic changes radically after Renchard and Brianna team up, as some of the seriousness slips away, and a little dark humor appears, such as when Renchard battles a bunch of zombies with a set of nunchaku.  With a background in martial arts, Mark Dacascos may not be the most versatile actor, but his low key approach works well in a role that requires a lot of physicality, and not much dialog.  Jeff Meed is also pretty good, as the ruthless and twisted Vincent.

Utilizing settings like sewers, alleys, parking garages, abandoned buildings, and a junkyard, the film gets things done without spending a lot for sets.  The zombies are plentiful and are usually easy kills, but the occasional fight is usually entertaining.  CGI type special effects are minimal, and not particularly well done.  There are some huge plot holes, and much that does not stand up to serious scrutiny, but if you are not overly critical, I Am Omega is decent B-movie fare, for those interested in post apocalyptical scenarios.",1283385600,,3196,4.861623616236162
2945147,4,B000VLLYGC,"I like Mark Dacascos as an actor (and ""The Chairman"" on Iron Chef America - he over-does it ... in a good way) and I like the Omega Man story, so I figured this would be a good way to burn a couple of hours. I was not disappointed.
Although the script was stilted when it called for more than one speaking part, the action scenes were quite good and most of the surprises were - well, surprising.
Mr. Dacascos did a very believable job of acting like a man who was in the type of situation this movie is about, you know, not quite completely crazy, but well on his way. The other actors could have been better, but I don't think the script really allowed for that. Toward the end reality really had to be suspended (how many times can you be shot on the legs and still manage to kick a black-belt's ass?) but the beginning through the middle - when Mark Dacascos had the only non-zombie role, were a delight to watch.

2945151,1,B000VLLYGC,"I Am Omega (Griff Furst, 2006)

It's often crossed my mind over the years that Iron Chef America has been on the air that Kitchen Stadium looks an awful lot like the kind of place that has a secret network of bunkers beneath it that could house important people if some sort of major world disaster struck. I now have all the evidence I need, as it seems Chairman Kaga's nephew is the last man on Earth.

If you ever wondered what it would look like if the Shaw Brothers teamed up with Godfrey Ho to do an adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic (and much-adapted) novel I Am Legend, first off, I'd like to offer my condolences that you not only have far too much time on your hands, but that you also know who the Shaw Brothers are (and, even worse, who Godfrey Ho is). Second, I'd tell you to look no further, for it would look a lot like the dog of a movie. Mark Dacascos, who plays Kaga's fictional nephew on Iron Chef America, here plays Renchard, an analog of Robert Neville from the more faithful I Am Legend adaptations, but instead of a scientist looking for a cure for the disease that's swept the nation (and probably the world), here he's just trying to put an end to it, at least in his particular corner of the world (which is Oxnard, California), by blowing the city sky-high. Plans get complicated when he gets a distress call from Brianna, a woman trapped in the city (Jennifer Lee Wiggins, recently of the even worse The Bone Eater), and two would-be heroes from a supposed enclave of survivors in the mountains, Vincent and Mike (screenwriter Geoff Meed of Little Miss Sunshine and Ryan Lloyd of one of my favorite shorts of the last few years, Night of the Hell Hamsters), who have come to rescue her, but need Renchard's knowledge of the less-populated ways into the city.

As you can probably tell, this is an even looser ""adaptation"" of Matheson's book than Night of the Living Dead was, but where that film can obviously be taken on its own merits, there's nothing here to suggest that Meed and Furst wanted to create anything more than a cheap Shaw Brothers-style exploitation/action flick. And taken in that light, it's at least passable, in that there's a decent amount of action, and Jennifer Lee Wiggins, for all that she can't act her way out of a paper bag, is certainly easy on the eyes. And with that said, Wiggins is probably the strongest member of this cast. I liked Ryan Lloyd a whole lot better when all he had to do was wear a giant bunny suit and look threatening. Dacascos... well, the less said about his performance, the better. The only sympathy I could garner for him was having to go from having his meals prepared by the world's finest chefs to eating a whole lot of MREs. Not that any actors, no matter how talented, could have done a great deal with the painfully inept script handed to them. Furst's direction is competent (certainly more so than it was on the only other Furst-directed movie I've had the misfortune to see, Basilisk: The Serpent King), but nothing more than that. Not that better direction could have saved this mess.

For obvious reasons, it's a must-see for Iron Chef America fanatics. Everyone else can safely avoid wasting the ninety minutes of their lives they'd have otherwise spent watching this. * ",1242172800,,3275,4.5534804753820035

Dacascos made his mark years ago in martial arts movies and has since tried to make the switch to straight drama.  Based on a steady string of turkeys like this one, he made a poor career choice. Here, he is Renchard, one of the very few survivors of some unknown and unexplained plague that wiped out most of earth's population and has caused the rest to mutate into zombies who seek to feast on human flesh. Renchard shows little of the common sense that Vincent Price showed in THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. Where Price would barricade himself into his Fortress of Solitude, Renchard constructs a home that any third rate burglar could break into. He spends his days aimlessly until he receives an internet video feed from a woman who asks his help.  We are not supposed to ask how the internet is still working years after society has collapsed. The plot founders as he meets a pair of ex-soldiers who ask him to help them locate her, when logic dictates that they could have found her on their own.  Dacascos has frequent shoot em ups with assorted zombies, but there is no forward motion to the story.  There is no climax or falling action: just shoot outs with zombies.  You know that an action movie is in trouble when the hero gets upstaged by the Bad Guy. Dacascos simply does not know how to generate audience interest.  He might rent THE LAST MAN ON EARTH to see how Vincent Price could force the audience to feel his pain.  With Dacascos, we just did not care.",1237593600,13,1798,4.4407294832826745
2945153,3,B000VLLYGC,"First of all, let me get this straight with you.  Casablanca is a five star movie in the 'art' section of movies.  Then, you have one to five stars in the mid-range section (where most movies 'used' to fall in.  I am Omega is a three star (at best) in the 'popcorn' section....that's low art/no art.

Let me give you a short list;

1.  Everywhere this guy goes, he carries an automatic rifle.  Every time he stops, he puts it down and takes a walk.  Everytime he does--they attack.  You'd think he'd learn to either carry it everywhere he goes, or wear a pistol and holster.
2.  He lives in a house where the front wall is made of glass (dummy).  About twenty minutes into the movie (after surviving several attacks) he figures out he should put a lock ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR!
3.  You can't safely get their blood on you yet half the time he goes into karate mode and beats them to a bloody pulp (gets blood all over him.  He pulls out this cough syrup bottle(about four ounches) and pours it over the bloody areas....I'd have brought a gallon bucket of it.
4.  If he sees them twenty feet away, he doesn't shoot until they are five feet away from him (if he shoots at all)...and this guy supposed to have been in the elite military.
5.  Apparently this movie takes place several years after a plague hits.  Does he go shoping?  Nope.  Does he arm himself and build a fortress?...no. (he already has one gun and lives in the mountains)  So what does he do?...he decides to blow up the nearby city.  So I ask you...........'Hey you!, Where's this idiot gonna get his supplies from?'  He ain't no farmer, and he doesn't have any stockpiles of food, clothing, water, ammo, weapons, BATHROOM TISSUE! and so on.
six.  Minor spoiler here!!! Two guys drive up in a van, claiming to be marines.  They want him to help them catch this girl he talked to on the computer (yes, years later we still have electricity, computers, satellite communications, voice and camera over the internet--and him without a digital camera or microphone)  Anyway, they intercepted his conversation with the girl(I think he believed she was his imagination).  Oldtechno could have told them...""Hey THEM! If you heard the same coversation--then you know where she is as well as ME!  But now, they want him to talk to her instead, and ask her where she is.  He does.  She doesn't know.  Oldtechno could have told her...""Hey, HER! Look at the number on the nearest telephone, tell me, I'll look it up in the phonebook!"" ...or...""Hey, HER!  See that streetsign just outside your window--READ IT!""

So, (catch my breath here) just what is oldtechno trying to say?  Rent it!, if you buy it, get it used and CHEAP.  Otherwise, it's an okay way to kill an already dead Friday night.

I have heard that this low-budget film was shot in less than two weeks, a fact which doesn't inspire much confidence, and it definitely displays a number of flaws, but I'll be doggoned if I didn't enjoy this movie quite a bit.

Mark Dacascos plays Renchard, seemingly the sole survivor of a mysterious plague or virus that turned all of his friends and neighbors into mindless zombies.  We don't know how long he has been living a life of solitude, but it has to have been a pretty good while because his hold on sanity has become pretty slippery.  He talks to a dressed-up dummy, suffers from hallucinations, and takes all sorts of unidentified pills to get by.  It's perfectly understandable, especially since he doesn't have the luxury of monster-free days - since this film populates the world with zombies instead of vampires, Renchard has to be on-guard constantly when he is out making his rounds.  Things could be worse, though.  For wholly unexplainable reasons, the power is still on and he still has access to the Internet.  He also has his house rigged up to alert him of any zombie intruders, but it's far from a fortified sanctuary for him.  Of course, once all the bombs he has systematically placed all over Los Angeles explode, the resident zombie population should be drastically reduced.  Of course, the best-laid plans of mice and men ... but to say more would be to give away too much of the story.

The most obvious weakness of I Am Omega is character development.  Aside from the loss of his wife and son, we really learn nothing about Renchard's life before the zombie apocalypse, and as such I had trouble forging any kind of strong emotional connection with the guy.  In Matheson's original novel and most adaptations of it, the main character's background is a central part of the story.  We are also left completely in the dark as to how the zombie apocalypse came about.  I can't say I was all that impressed with the zombies populating Renchard's world, either - oh, they look great (this film's special effects are really impressive given the limited budget), but they are just way too easy to kill.  One shot (even if it's in an arm or a leg) and they're down for the count (sadly, there's only one satisfying head shot in the whole movie); our protagonist, however, can take multiple bullets and still man up and take care of business.  And, as I've already mentioned, it's just ludicrous to think that the Internet would still be operating normally this long after man has become all but extinct.

The negatives weren't enough to ruin my enjoyment of the film, however.  Aside from the basic premise, the story differentiates itself nicely from The Omega Man and The Last Man on Earth, forging its own identity somewhere between the two.  Additionally, the zombie-killing action is enhanced by Dacascos' martial arts prowess - it's not every day you see a dude take out a gang of zombies with numchuks and wheelhouse kicks.  I actually have quite a fondness for The Asylum and its growing number of horrible B-movies, but I Am Omega deserves better than to be lumped together with the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldiers/dp/B000RO9Q7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldiers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AVH-Alien-Vs-Hunter/dp/B000YV2EF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AVH: Alien Vs.

3179634,3,B000VLLYGC,"Richard Matheson's post-apocalyptic tale of a society overrun by the monstrous victims of a deadly illness has been made into movies several times now, and this Asylum adaptation takes its title from 2 past adaptations, Omega Man and I am Legend. The lone hero scientist here is played by under-appreciated martial arts star Mark Dacascos, who uses as many kicks and machete strikes as gunshots to dispatch the cannibal undead.

These direct-to-video sci-fi films tend to follow a pretty predictable formula, so I'll break this review down into its constituent parts:

Lone Token Celebrity:
Mark Dacascos. His capacity for chop-sockey should by all rights have made him generation Y's Jean-Claud Van Damme, but a lack of big ticket US exposure and the old Hollywood blessing/curse of being vaguely ethnic have doomed him to being a poor man's Dwayne Johnson. It's too bad because he's an awesome performer.

Lesson About Man's Hubris:
Even after the fall of society man is the greatest monster, but unlike in Heston's film man is not the CREATOR of the monsters, nor are the monsters here feeling, sympathetic creatures as they are in that film.

Carnage:
Good while it lasts, but there's not much. A whole city explodes at the end, but it's not very well done (and it would be foolish of you to expect it would be).

Awful Effects:
Just average zombie gore, with some bad explosions at the finish. If you consider sepia tinting an effect, well, it's in full force and wears out its welcome fast.

Romantic Subplot:
Boy meets girl over video chat, and they go on the lam from zombies. It's like You've Got Mail, really.

Big Action Truck:
Various cars, including a conveniently named Oldsmobile Omega. To be fair though, classic Oldsmobiles were truck-sized.

Predictable rote, and done many times before, not even Mark Dacascos can save this plodding horror film from the shambling doom of living death. Also if everyone is dead or monsters, how does he get power and water for his fridge ice maker?",1360195200,,2000,4.896449704142012

3179636,2,B000VLLYGC,"Disclaimer:  I viewed this film as a streaming rental and as such cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of the individual disc.  My review is concerned with the entertanment value of the film only.

The relative merits of a film such as I AM OMEGA, starring Mark Dacascos and produced by Asylum Home Entertainment, can sometimes be obscured by previous experience with the actors and production company involved, as well as with the films that provided the 'inspiration' for the movie in question.  I AM OMEGA is another in a long list of films by Asylum designed to ride on the coattails of a blockbuster release - in this case Will Smith's I AM LEGEND - and evidently do so on a much smaller budget.  The merely cynical might say Asylum is looking to sponge off the hype and popularity of the better advertised (and probably better in all respects) film, although those given to more charitable opinions could conceivably claim that films such as I AM OMEGA provide genre fans who can't get enough of the concept more grist for the mill, so to speak.

I suppose I'm a mixture - I have a pretty good idea of what Asylum's business model aspires to, yet I'm also genre junkie who has watched a lot of B-grade (or Z) material over the years and keeps going back for more.  That's what makes this one such a great rental - the only cost was the time involved.  And really, what are we talking about here?  Kurosawa?  Goddard?  Herzog?  No, we are not.  Those who are uninitiated into the joys of zombie films probably only see the thinnest of margins between a classic such as Fulci's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombie/dp/B005CU5OEU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombie</a>&nbsp;or Romero's work and a film like I AM OMEGA.  And, while I can appreciate that opinion, for myself, I think there are distinctions - in relation to other movies of the same kind, I AM OMEGA stacks up somewhere south of good, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its charms.

This is one of those two-star films that I liked.  Mark Dacascos, known for his appearances on Iron Chef and Hawaii Five-O, is Renchard, a survivor of an unexplained apocalyptical plague of...well, I'm not sure what they are because it's never explained.  For convenience, I think you could call them plague infected humans who would like to eat you - since the film bears so many other similarities to I AM LEGEND, we might as well borrow that description too.  Fearing that he is the last normal human alive, he uses his skills learned in the military to survive and also to plan the destruction of the city, thereby wiping out the hive of infected humans.  But the best laid schemes gang aft agley, as they say, and Renchard receives a signal from a lone woman trapped inside the city.  Bearing an uncanny resemblance to his late wife, Renchard at first has trouble accepting whether she is real or merely a figment of his imagination.

But the plot thickens when two former recon Marines show up at his front door.  Having intercepted the transmissions between the girl and Renchard, they inform him that they are from a stronghold of survivors, and the girl is somehow immune to the virus - the hope of mankind.  They need him to show them how to sneak into the city, and proceed to convince him - by using the strongest terms available - to help them retrieve the girl.  But the question on every viewers mind at this point has to be, 'What do they REALLY want her for?'

Well, as I said, I kinda sorta liked the film, but make no mistake, it's still a two-star effort, and even that may be generous.  First of all, there are plot holes in this one you could throw a plague-infected human through (like where is all the electricity or internet signal coming from, or just how far CAN you push a car with a bullet in each arm and one in the leg); and I think that it's also fairly obvious that if your main star is known for his martial arts skills, then there is going to be a large part of the film where he is going to use roubndhouse kicks and nunchuks while fighting off the legions of the...whatevers, no matter how ridiculous that seems when you have a machine gun available.  My suggestion would be not to get wrapped up in such points - like why our heroes would choose a convertable to ride through city streets infested with superhuman plague victims.  It seems pretty self-evident that there's no other way to have really cool scenes of fighting zombies out of a convertable if they don't.  The larger point is, as a zombie junkie, do we REALLY need all the details spelled out for us in a logical, scientifically reasonable way?  No, not really, or at least I don't all the time.  What makes a good zombie film anyway?  I mean, we're begining from a ludicrous premise anyway, so to my mind, I want to indulge in the vicarious fantasy of surviving in such a world.  Do the minds behind I AM OMEGA create enough tension in that regard that I'm interested enought to follow along? - ahhhh, I don't know.  Sorta.

I AM OMEGA follows the conventions of the genre well enough so that I can fill in any of the blanks that I want to (or not) however I choose.  And because my expectations for I AM OMEGA were almost as low as for any Michael Bay film, I just chose to overlook what I couldn't reconcile with reality, and I ended up satisfied.  I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone though - what would be the point?  If you don't like zombie films to begin with, without a doubt you won't like this one, and if you're a zombie junkie like I am, you've already watched it.  Or you've been tempted to - you know you have.  Might as well go ahead and get it over with.",1338595200,,5683,4.538763493621198

3179638,3,B000VLLYGC,"I've seen this movie now about two and a half times. The 1/2 time was when I caught just part of it on tv. I can watch this from start to finish, comparing it with the three other movies that it hopes to join: The Last Man on Earth, The Omega Man and I am Legend.

On a scale of greatness I rank the movies like this:

1) Omega Man------------------ the perennial classic, if not the first.
2) I Am Legend---------------- the big money modern remake of two movies.
3) The Last Man on Earth------ the idea is fleshed out. The movie plods, Vincent Price was no action hero.
4) I Am Omega----------------- modern B Movie homage to three other movies.

I think ""I Am Omega"" is a good title. I think the lead actor is pretty good, even if his character is a bit wacky. I think the martial arts idea was a good one, even if it wasn't employed well. Mostly the character just practices. As for the ""dead or diseased mutants"", yes it's actors in zip up suits but it still works. The mutants in this movie are muscular and they look reptilian. These mutants come out in the day which is new to the series of movies. The sun does not burn these mutants. These mutants may or may not need to sleep in the day.

As for the movie, there is little plot. There is a flashback of the main character watching the news, or was it a radio broadcast, but some crisis is being broadcast. This viewer has no real idea why the world went to hell. All this viewer knows is that the main character wants to blow up the city. He travels in the sewer to plant explosives so he can blow up natural gas lines.

The movie is pretty good when ""Omega"" is trying to escape the city. Omega fights off zombies in the parking garage. The rescued girl takes off; Omega rejoins her. They meet up with another character, a two faced bad guy who shoots the good guy and takes off with the girl. The girl has the cure in her blood. Omega later fights the bad guy, white from blood loss, he stands on what should be broken bones and kills the bad guy. The two escape in a very nice car. Omega does not DIE at the end of this movie, which is NICE for a change. The End.

The movie presents some new elements, zombies in the day, Mr. Omega does not have to DIE at the end of the movie. The ZOMBIES get blown up for a change. Humanity makes progress. This movie really needed a happy ending because it didn't have a whole lot going for it. The lead character Mr. Omega was pretty cool, athletic, quirky, too trusting, too heroic for his own good. And finally, it's strange how the internet still worked after the world went to hell and all. Not sure how it works, but it worked for Omega and the girl with the special blood.

This movie is good for the new ideas alone. I just hope they keep remaking this movie. The movies have never been literal adaptions of the book, but that's ok because the book is little dark, a bit crude/nasty, and a bit dark and dumb.",1317427200,,2916,4.196428571428571

(1) The female lead is not helpless and is, in fact, more stable and resilient than the hero.
(2) The hero is well-versed in killing zombies.  For example, he cleans the blood from himself and his weapons to avoid contamination.
(3) The zombies are real and not CGI.
(4) The fight scenes are fast-paced and well-shot.
(5) Hungry zombies are hungry, crazy humans are crazy, the dead city is dead.  The movie is consistent and does not give any unrealistic miracles or surprises.
(6) The DVD is cheap.

The Bad
(1) The movie gives no explanation of how and why the power grid and Internet are still running.

3179641,3,B000VLLYGC,"Well now Asylum's really made a mess of things.

See, it's very easy to brush off Asylum's mockbuster-style movies as drek. This is why it's become something of a hobby for reviewers to bash the studio for whatever it produces.  The very nature of these quickly-produced movies guarantees they will be derivative films. And for the most part, this criticism is well-earned.

Until I Am Omega came along.  I Am Omega is a mockbuster of Will Smith's I Am Legend (2007), which was a remake of The Omega Man (1971), which was a remake of The Last Man on Earth (1964), which was based on the book I Am Legend by Richard Matheson that also happened to inspired Night of the Living Dead (1968). Nobody is in a position to call I Am Omega derivative.

The fact that I Am Legend inspired Night of the Living Dead is a clue to I Am Omega's interpretation, which replaces the vampire-like mutants with plain old zombies. Director Griff Furst knows how to film a shot, pace a scene, and cut away before it becomes too obvious that there isn't much of a special effects budget.

I Am Omega's leading man is Renchard (Mark Dacascos).  Dacascos is a martial artist first, actor second, but he manages to convincingly carry scenes that are essentially one man slowly going insane in the home where his wife and child were eaten by zombies.  Renchard's lonely world is rocked when he receives a video chat request from a woman (Jennifer Lee Wiggins) who is the spitting image of his dead wife.  Shortly thereafter, two other survivors, Vincent (Geoff Meed) and Mike (Ryan Lloyd) insist Renchard lead the way through the sewers to the missing girl.  She carries the cure to the zombie plague within her.  There's just one problem - Renchard's been working on setting charges through the city to blow up the ""zombie hive"" and end their scourge once and for all.

The zombies and the damsel in distress are incidental.  The real stars are Meed, who infuses his villain with both insanity and redneck menace.  Dacascos works hard to give Renchard a wide range of emotions.  He may not be the best actor, but he gives it his all here.

At heart, this is a movie about a guy who fights zombies with nunchucks.  But it is also a surprisingly tense, poignant, and occasionally funny film that rises above its B-movie material by embracing it.  Post-apocalyptic zombie killing has become so common a trope that nearly any movie treading the same ground borders on parody.  But I Am Omega is a homage to the ridiculousness that is a zombie plague.  If it occasionally borders on the completely nonsensical, complete with odd time shifts and characters surviving grievous wounds...the zombies are there to remind us of the perils of nitpicking.

And that's too bad for Asylum.  It means they can make a decent movie if they so choose.  They've just raised a very low bar.  Here's hoping we see more I Am Omegas and less Legions of the Dead in the future.",1288396800,5,2926,4.625968992248062

Sit back and enjoy...especially the fight scene with the Nonchuks.  I'm sure this is a first for zombie flicks!",1285459200,,277,4.5
3179643,3,B000VLLYGC,"There is some light baggage associated with I Am Omega (2007), a direct to video feature produced by The Asylum, which was released just prior to the opening of the film I Am Legend (2007), supposedly in an attempt to cash in on the buzz generated by Will Smith's special effects heavy blockbuster.  It would be difficult to confuse the two films, as in comparison I Am Omega is a much more modest effort.

Writer Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend, is perhaps his most influential work.  The story about a post-apocalyptic world, where all of mankind except for one man, have become vampire like creatures, was first adapted for the screen in The Last Man on Earth (1964) starring Vincent Price, followed by The Omega Man (1971) starring Charlton Heston.  Matheson's work is also cited by George Romero as an influence on the zombie genre.

Matheson's novel may not be officially credited as a source, but I Am Omega clearly borrows heavily from it.  Renchard (Mark Dacascos) believes he is the last survivor of a terrible virus that has transformed mankind into deadly zombies.  Living alone in a rural area, he spends his days killing zombies, and planting explosive charges on natural gas lines, in preparation for blowing up what is left of civilization.  Fortunately electricity is still available and somehow the internet is still functional, as one night Renchard is knocked on his ass, when he is contacted online by a woman named Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins).

Via webcam, Brianna says that there are other survivors at a place called Antioch, and that she is trapped in a nearby city.  Renchard refuses her request to come and rescue her, but later after two men armed with guns blow up his home, Renchard is coerced into making the trip into the city.  Vincent (Jeff Meed), and Mike (Ryan Lloyd), say that they are from Antioch, and need Brianna because she has immunity to the virus.  Entering the city through sewer tunnels, Renchard manages to locate Brianna, but must get clear of the city fast, before his timed explosive charges detonate.

The story may be derivative, but it generally moves at a quick pace, and occasionally generates real suspense and tension.  The dynamic changes radically after Renchard and Brianna team up, as some of the seriousness slips away, and a little dark humor appears, such as when Renchard battles a bunch of zombies with a set of nunchaku.  With a background in martial arts, Mark Dacascos may not be the most versatile actor, but his low key approach works well in a role that requires a lot of physicality, and not much dialog.  Jeff Meed is also pretty good, as the ruthless and twisted Vincent.

Utilizing settings like sewers, alleys, parking garages, abandoned buildings, and a junkyard, the film gets things done without spending a lot for sets.  The zombies are plentiful and are usually easy kills, but the occasional fight is usually entertaining.  CGI type special effects are minimal, and not particularly well done.  There are some huge plot holes, and much that does not stand up to serious scrutiny, but if you are not overly critical, I Am Omega is decent B-movie fare, for those interested in post apocalyptical scenarios.",1283385600,,3196,4.861623616236162
3179644,4,B000VLLYGC,"I like Mark Dacascos as an actor (and ""The Chairman"" on Iron Chef America - he over-does it ... in a good way) and I like the Omega Man story, so I figured this would be a good way to burn a couple of hours. I was not disappointed.
Although the script was stilted when it called for more than one speaking part, the action scenes were quite good and most of the surprises were - well, surprising.
Mr. Dacascos did a very believable job of acting like a man who was in the type of situation this movie is about, you know, not quite completely crazy, but well on his way. The other actors could have been better, but I don't think the script really allowed for that. Toward the end reality really had to be suspended (how many times can you be shot on the legs and still manage to kick a black-belt's ass?) but the beginning through the middle - when Mark Dacascos had the only non-zombie role, were a delight to watch.

3179648,1,B000VLLYGC,"I Am Omega (Griff Furst, 2006)

It's often crossed my mind over the years that Iron Chef America has been on the air that Kitchen Stadium looks an awful lot like the kind of place that has a secret network of bunkers beneath it that could house important people if some sort of major world disaster struck. I now have all the evidence I need, as it seems Chairman Kaga's nephew is the last man on Earth.

If you ever wondered what it would look like if the Shaw Brothers teamed up with Godfrey Ho to do an adaptation of Richard Matheson's classic (and much-adapted) novel I Am Legend, first off, I'd like to offer my condolences that you not only have far too much time on your hands, but that you also know who the Shaw Brothers are (and, even worse, who Godfrey Ho is). Second, I'd tell you to look no further, for it would look a lot like the dog of a movie. Mark Dacascos, who plays Kaga's fictional nephew on Iron Chef America, here plays Renchard, an analog of Robert Neville from the more faithful I Am Legend adaptations, but instead of a scientist looking for a cure for the disease that's swept the nation (and probably the world), here he's just trying to put an end to it, at least in his particular corner of the world (which is Oxnard, California), by blowing the city sky-high. Plans get complicated when he gets a distress call from Brianna, a woman trapped in the city (Jennifer Lee Wiggins, recently of the even worse The Bone Eater), and two would-be heroes from a supposed enclave of survivors in the mountains, Vincent and Mike (screenwriter Geoff Meed of Little Miss Sunshine and Ryan Lloyd of one of my favorite shorts of the last few years, Night of the Hell Hamsters), who have come to rescue her, but need Renchard's knowledge of the less-populated ways into the city.

As you can probably tell, this is an even looser ""adaptation"" of Matheson's book than Night of the Living Dead was, but where that film can obviously be taken on its own merits, there's nothing here to suggest that Meed and Furst wanted to create anything more than a cheap Shaw Brothers-style exploitation/action flick. And taken in that light, it's at least passable, in that there's a decent amount of action, and Jennifer Lee Wiggins, for all that she can't act her way out of a paper bag, is certainly easy on the eyes. And with that said, Wiggins is probably the strongest member of this cast. I liked Ryan Lloyd a whole lot better when all he had to do was wear a giant bunny suit and look threatening. Dacascos... well, the less said about his performance, the better. The only sympathy I could garner for him was having to go from having his meals prepared by the world's finest chefs to eating a whole lot of MREs. Not that any actors, no matter how talented, could have done a great deal with the painfully inept script handed to them. Furst's direction is competent (certainly more so than it was on the only other Furst-directed movie I've had the misfortune to see, Basilisk: The Serpent King), but nothing more than that. Not that better direction could have saved this mess.

For obvious reasons, it's a must-see for Iron Chef America fanatics. Everyone else can safely avoid wasting the ninety minutes of their lives they'd have otherwise spent watching this. * ",1242172800,,3275,4.5534804753820035
3179649,2,B000VLLYGC,"I AM OMEGA is a pale copy of a very original idea first seen in THE LAST MAN ON EARTH, then later in THE OMEGA MAN, then most recently in I AM LEGEND.  Now director Geoff FURST tries to recreate the same suspense that Vincent Price so effortlessly showed in the original.  Unfortunately, he has only Mark Dacascos to play the lead. Dacascos made his mark years ago in martial arts movies and has since tried to make the switch to straight drama.  Based on a steady string of turkeys like this one, he made a poor career choice. Here, he is Renchard, one of the very few survivors of some unknown and unexplained plague that wiped out most of earth's population and has caused the rest to mutate into zombies who seek to feast on human flesh. Renchard shows little of the common sense that Vincent Price showed in THE LAST MAN ON EARTH. Where Price would barricade himself into his Fortress of Solitude, Renchard constructs a home that any third rate burglar could break into. He spends his days aimlessly until he receives an internet video feed from a woman who asks his help.  We are not supposed to ask how the internet is still working years after society has collapsed. The plot founders as he meets a pair of ex-soldiers who ask him to help them locate her, when logic dictates that they could have found her on their own.  Dacascos has frequent shoot em ups with assorted zombies, but there is no forward motion to the story.  There is no climax or falling action: just shoot outs with zombies.  You know that an action movie is in trouble when the hero gets upstaged by the Bad Guy. Dacascos simply does not know how to generate audience interest.  He might rent THE LAST MAN ON EARTH to see how Vincent Price could force the audience to feel his pain.  With Dacascos, we just did not care.",1237593600,13,1798,4.4407294832826745
3179650,3,B000VLLYGC,"First of all, let me get this straight with you.  Casablanca is a five star movie in the 'art' section of movies.  Then, you have one to five stars in the mid-range section (where most movies 'used' to fall in.  I am Omega is a three star (at best) in the 'popcorn' section....that's low art/no art.

Let me give you a short list;

1.  Everywhere this guy goes, he carries an automatic rifle.  Every time he stops, he puts it down and takes a walk.  Everytime he does--they attack.  You'd think he'd learn to either carry it everywhere he goes, or wear a pistol and holster.
2.  He lives in a house where the front wall is made of glass (dummy).  About twenty minutes into the movie (after surviving several attacks) he figures out he should put a lock ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE FRONT DOOR!
3.  You can't safely get their blood on you yet half the time he goes into karate mode and beats them to a bloody pulp (gets blood all over him.  He pulls out this cough syrup bottle(about four ounches) and pours it over the bloody areas....I'd have brought a gallon bucket of it.
4.  If he sees them twenty feet away, he doesn't shoot until they are five feet away from him (if he shoots at all)...and this guy supposed to have been in the elite military.
5.  Apparently this movie takes place several years after a plague hits.  Does he go shoping?  Nope.  Does he arm himself and build a fortress?...no. (he already has one gun and lives in the mountains)  So what does he do?...he decides to blow up the nearby city.  So I ask you...........'Hey you!, Where's this idiot gonna get his supplies from?'  He ain't no farmer, and he doesn't have any stockpiles of food, clothing, water, ammo, weapons, BATHROOM TISSUE! and so on.
six.  Minor spoiler here!!! Two guys drive up in a van, claiming to be marines.  They want him to help them catch this girl he talked to on the computer (yes, years later we still have electricity, computers, satellite communications, voice and camera over the internet--and him without a digital camera or microphone)  Anyway, they intercepted his conversation with the girl(I think he believed she was his imagination).  Oldtechno could have told them...""Hey THEM! If you heard the same coversation--then you know where she is as well as ME!  But now, they want him to talk to her instead, and ask her where she is.  He does.  She doesn't know.  Oldtechno could have told her...""Hey, HER! Look at the number on the nearest telephone, tell me, I'll look it up in the phonebook!"" ...or...""Hey, HER!  See that streetsign just outside your window--READ IT!""

So, (catch my breath here) just what is oldtechno trying to say?  Rent it!, if you buy it, get it used and CHEAP.  Otherwise, it's an okay way to kill an already dead Friday night.

I have heard that this low-budget film was shot in less than two weeks, a fact which doesn't inspire much confidence, and it definitely displays a number of flaws, but I'll be doggoned if I didn't enjoy this movie quite a bit.

Mark Dacascos plays Renchard, seemingly the sole survivor of a mysterious plague or virus that turned all of his friends and neighbors into mindless zombies.  We don't know how long he has been living a life of solitude, but it has to have been a pretty good while because his hold on sanity has become pretty slippery.  He talks to a dressed-up dummy, suffers from hallucinations, and takes all sorts of unidentified pills to get by.  It's perfectly understandable, especially since he doesn't have the luxury of monster-free days - since this film populates the world with zombies instead of vampires, Renchard has to be on-guard constantly when he is out making his rounds.  Things could be worse, though.  For wholly unexplainable reasons, the power is still on and he still has access to the Internet.  He also has his house rigged up to alert him of any zombie intruders, but it's far from a fortified sanctuary for him.  Of course, once all the bombs he has systematically placed all over Los Angeles explode, the resident zombie population should be drastically reduced.  Of course, the best-laid plans of mice and men ... but to say more would be to give away too much of the story.

The most obvious weakness of I Am Omega is character development.  Aside from the loss of his wife and son, we really learn nothing about Renchard's life before the zombie apocalypse, and as such I had trouble forging any kind of strong emotional connection with the guy.  In Matheson's original novel and most adaptations of it, the main character's background is a central part of the story.  We are also left completely in the dark as to how the zombie apocalypse came about.  I can't say I was all that impressed with the zombies populating Renchard's world, either - oh, they look great (this film's special effects are really impressive given the limited budget), but they are just way too easy to kill.  One shot (even if it's in an arm or a leg) and they're down for the count (sadly, there's only one satisfying head shot in the whole movie); our protagonist, however, can take multiple bullets and still man up and take care of business.  And, as I've already mentioned, it's just ludicrous to think that the Internet would still be operating normally this long after man has become all but extinct.

The negatives weren't enough to ruin my enjoyment of the film, however.  Aside from the basic premise, the story differentiates itself nicely from The Omega Man and The Last Man on Earth, forging its own identity somewhere between the two.  Additionally, the zombie-killing action is enhanced by Dacascos' martial arts prowess - it's not every day you see a dude take out a gang of zombies with numchuks and wheelhouse kicks.  I actually have quite a fondness for The Asylum and its growing number of horrible B-movies, but I Am Omega deserves better than to be lumped together with the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldiers/dp/B000RO9Q7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldiers</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/AVH-Alien-Vs-Hunter/dp/B000YV2EF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">AVH: Alien Vs.

Because, at the end of this movie, I found myself saying ""This is great!  This is a great movie!"" - and actually meaning it!  I know it's not a great movie, if for no other reason than because of the incongruity of the writing.  The plot is good, solid zombie fare; but the ironic twists - all of them involving the ex-marine characters - come absolutely out of nowhere.

You know that these yahoos are bad guys when one of them calls the hero ""compadre"" - because, in a movie, no one with good intentions ever calls the hero ""compadre.""  And you just as quickly realize that they could not possibly be looking to save the mysterious woman because she carries an immunity to the zombie virus in her blood; you assume they're looking for a sex slave - which actually is a good thing because it prevents the movie from devolving into the typical plot device of scientists wanting to use her as a guinea pig.  But when the one ex-marine makes it clear he intends to rape her then kill her - possibly the only surviving female on the planet - any logic in his madness flies right off the disc.

It also stretches reality beyond the breaking point how the woman manages to always pick out the one vehicle that actually works, will actually start, actually has a full tank of gas.  And, dear Lord, how many ramps can a parking garage possibly have?  And how did it happen that the two ex-marines, as conspicuous in their big white van as if they had just emerged from a giant billboard, managed to acquire so much knowledge of the hero - even knowing that he was planting explosives all through the city - without being detected by him.  What: he can sense a zombie creeping up on him a hundred yards off but can't detect two men tailing his every move?  And how did they know the woman had contacted him via video mail?  Gosh, can anyone hack into someone's internet connection?  Not to mention: who's minding the net?

The one thing this movie - and this review - has going for it is that I've not seen the Will Smith vehicle, which this movie apparently copies.  Of course, like almost everyone, I've read the Richard Matheson book ""I Am Legend"" and seen the Vincent Price movie ""The Last Man on Earth,"" but I haven't seen either the Charlton Heston or the Will Smith movie.

While watching ""I Am Omega"" I found myself thinking, because of the cinematography, directing, atmosphere and pacing, that ""The Walking Dead"" bears a strong resemblance.  That's primarily the source of the 5-stars I've given this movie.  So, instead of ""Guilt by Association,"" this would be an instance of ""Acclaim by Association.""",1364342400,2,2857,4.512621359223301
