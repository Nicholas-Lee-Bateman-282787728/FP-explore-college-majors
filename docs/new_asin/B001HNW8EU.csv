8309205,5,B001HNW8EU,"Scarlet Street is a bleak film in which an ordinary man succumbs first to vice and then to murder. Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson) is a lonely man married to a nagging wife. Painting is the only thing that brings him joy. Cross meets Kitty (Joan Bennett) who, believing him to be a famous painter, begins an affair with him. Encouraged by her lover, con man Johnny Prince (Dan Duryea) Kitty persuades Cross to embezzle money from his employer in order to pay for her lavish apartment. In that apartment, happy for the first time in his life, Cross paints Kitty's picture. Johnny then pretends that Kitty painted the portrait, which has won great critical acclaim. Finally realizing he has been manipulated, Cross kills Kitty, loses his job, and because his name has been stolen by Kitty, is unable to paint. He suffers a mental breakdown as the film ends, haunted by guilt. Kitty and Johnny are two of the most amoral and casual villains in the history of film noir, both like predatory animals completely without conscience. The photography is excellent in its use of stark black-and-white to convey psychological states. The film is unparalleled in its ability to convey the desperation of hapless, nave victims in a cruelly realistic world.

DigicomTV has done a wonderful job in restoring this classic movie. Excellent audio and visual quality. A must watch!!!!!",1390780800,,1373,4.9437229437229435
8309206,1,B001HNW8EU,"No one can dismiss Scarlet Street as anything less than one of director Fritz Lang's best films.  A supreme cast along with fantastic cinematography and studio supplied atmosphere help to create a memorable standout in film noir.  A classic film that has, unfortunately, languished in public domain hell for way too long.

But, if you are tempted to purchase a copy of this film, DO NOT buy this edition.  There is no restoration or remastering here.  If you want the definitive edition, get the KINO edition mastered from a Library of Congress 35mm negative.  You can find the DVD for around the same price and it is well worth the purchase.",1241481600,,642,4.738738738738738
8309207,5,B001HNW8EU,"This is another Fritz Lang masterpiece.  I got this version as a gift and I am very please with it.  A++++++++++++

In this remake of Jean Renoir's controversial 1931 film, La Chienne, Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson), a quiet, staid cashier and dedicated Sunday painter, feels consumed by passion for the first time in his life when he meets pretty, manipulative Kitty. The two become involved, but Kitty is really in love with petty crook Johnny. She keeps Christopher around simply for his money.

In order to impress his precious mistress, Cross embezzles funds from his employer. He doesn't realize, however, that Kitty and Johnny are also getting rich on his paintings, which are becoming a huge success under Kitty's name. When Christopher's theft comes to light, he loses his job and his dignity. And when he seeks out Kitty for solace, he discovers her in Johnny's embrace. The film explodes in its violent climax, and with it Lang creates perhaps his most chilling Film Noir work.

The tightly structured story and the evocative paintings that lie symbolically at the center of the plot create a visual and psychological atmosphere of suspense, filled with double meanings and games of representation and appearance, all pointing toward a brutal final act, motivated by Cross' inner demons and repressed emotions.",1229299200,,1329,5.105990783410138
8309208,4,B001HNW8EU,"This movie is another great film in the arsenal of Fritz Lang.  Film Noir at its finest!  Edward G. Robinson plays mild mannered banker who through circum-chance falls in love with Joan Bennett who plays a ""lady of the night"".  Robinson's character, Christopher Cross (will make you jump-jump) comes across Bennett's character, Kitty March while she is being bullied by her BF (pimp) Johnny Prince, played by Dan Duryea (See Detour).  Bored with his life, Cross gets tangled with Kitty and is soon stealing from the bank to support his lifestyle with her.  Twists abound as Cross, Kitty & Johnny get tangled up in a web of deceit & lies.  I won't ruin the end.  This film fits perfectly into the Film-Noir genre and is a must own for Fritz Lang and Film Noir fans.",1225756800,,764,4.614814814814815
8309209,5,B001HNW8EU,"This is a disturbing movie, in many ways. Edward G. Robinson, who is superb, is a pipsqueak in a trivial job. He's married to an absolute virago and retreats from his relative career failure and his unhappy home life through his painting. Joan Bennett, also very good, humiliates him further and steals his creative name as well. Dan Duryea is sublimely creepy as her boyfriend.

It's gorgeously filmed and has a fine script. I have to say that I prefer Renoir's ""La Chienne,"" on which it is a variation. Both are good movies and in some ways there is no real point comparing them. For example, in some ways ""They Live By Night"" is a uniquely beautiful movie. In other ways, Robert Altman's take on that same story, ""Thieves Like Us,"" is more immediate and gripping, though less heartbreaking.",1223942400,,793,4.705035971223022
