5696155,5,B00C7CLHGU,"That was one heck of a movie.. loved it how to see more work done, considering that those with mental problems can hurt others but when you try to twist events like that as the old saying goes God don't like ugly!!! Or just payback is a B@#$$",1453420800,,242,4.0625
5696156,1,B00C7CLHGU,"The acting in this is really bad.  The plot is OK and with a twist, but very slow.  The sexist environment beginning to end is really irritating and sleazy.  Definitely would not recommend.",1453420800,3,189,4.666666666666667
5696157,4,B00C7CLHGU,"As has been said, this is a dark psychological thriller but it goes beyond what the audience is led to believe and by doing so, it is art imitating life. In the plot there is a betrayal of innocence resulting in an adult with flashbacks, additional betrayal occurs to the same character, office sexual harassment, the unethical disclosure of the past and more. I cannot summarize further without giving the movie away.
The mask is reminiscent of the Apache bird mask and is a beautiful work in and of itself. The movie script holds the viewer's interest as the plot unfolds. The movie was enjoyable for me primarily due to its plot being a bit different. The acting was well done.",1452643200,,680,4.628099173553719
5696158,5,B00C7CLHGU,"I enjoyed this movie thoroughly! Mariel is a fantastic actress! If a big producer puts her in a big scale movie, she will be a star! She acted amazing even when one of her co actors was not giving her much to work with, she was still very genuine and believable! My good friend Phil Aslaksen wrote this and even put me in a minor role, hey I did great, lol. Is that why I'm giving it five stars, lol. No! This actress is someone to watch out for and can be a force to reckon with if given a chance!  Phil Aslaksen is not only a great martial artist n genuine good person, give his movies a chance, he's very inventive and clever! We need to support great guys with big hearts with talent. Enjoy!",1404777600,,695,4.110294117647059
5696159,4,B00C7CLHGU,"Very well written and some bee good acting! Check it out if you want good cinema,  great cinematography and solid actors",1395964800,,120,4.714285714285714
5696160,4,B00C7CLHGU,"I really enjoyed the movie ""Armynel"".  It's a sleek and sexy psychological thriller that really sucks you in, to where you lose track of time.  I loved the star Mariel Gomsrud in this movie; she gave such a powerful, raw performance and is simply beautiful.  It's a dark movie, and I love dark movies that explore the shadow side of the human psyche.  I would definitely recommend this dark, sexy thriller.",1395100800,,406,4.676056338028169
5696161,1,B00C7CLHGU,"Poor acting, poor storyline and not a high budget film, should be offered free of charge. It's not worth the money",1387497600,4,114,4.476190476190476
8578182,1,B00C7CLHGU,"The twists were just too weird. Then so bad that I expected each bad move there after.
The acting was unimaginative and boring.",1457481600,,127,4.565217391304348
8578183,1,B00C7CLHGU,"Pretty terrible.  A real cheap feel to it, acting was not very good.  Yeah.... sucks the big one.",1456617600,,97,4.333333333333333
8578184,2,B00C7CLHGU,so so movie...c movie with some bad acting...the story line quite recycled with no originality...,1456531200,,97,5.533333333333333
8578185,2,B00C7CLHGU,Not worth your time - bad script/plot + bad acting = failure.,1456012800,,61,4.166666666666667
8578186,1,B00C7CLHGU,"Cant tell what was worse. The main characters face or the bad acting. The script dialogue was that of high school acting. Every character was anticipating the end of each line when speaking.

And who has apartment that echos like that with a metal ceiling. I could go on.",1455580800,,271,4.530612244897959
8578187,1,B00C7CLHGU,"Horrible acting, horrible awkwardness, and over all one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Also the imdb information is all wrong. It's a different movie. imdb has much lower rating for real with only 4 reviews because no one has ever even seen this movie. And no Morgan Freeman is not in it. I would compare this movie to birdemic, but even worse as it does not make it to so bad it's good. Negative infinity out of 10.",1455408000,,423,4.234567901234568
8578188,2,B00C7CLHGU,"I guess there are worse movies, but there is literally no point to this.  The ""twist"" was predictable but is not actually explained.  Why did this need to happen?",1455321600,2,162,4.551724137931035
8578189,1,B00C7CLHGU,"If you're on the fence, skip it, it's bad all around. Bad acting paired with a very stupid plot filled with holes. Lots of goofy shots and misplaced attempts at giving the viewer a scare.  No clue why it says this has such a high IMDB rating.",1454803200,2,242,4.148936170212766
8578190,1,B00C7CLHGU,"I'm uncertain how Amazon reflected that IMDB gave it a 9.3 rating when going to IMDB's site gave it a 5.8. The acting was poor, the plot mediocre, and the twist wasn't really much of a twist.",1454803200,2,191,4.1891891891891895
8578191,5,B00C7CLHGU,Another great multi-personality thriller.  The mask is really creepy.  And the truth is hidden well.,1453593600,,100,5.6
