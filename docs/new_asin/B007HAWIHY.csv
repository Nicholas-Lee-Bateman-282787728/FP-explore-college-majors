8516541,5,B007HAWIHY,"Yes, this video is listed as anaerobic, but being on Vancouver Island I didn't think it would be this challenging.  I was wrong.  I have a number of Paul's other videos and this one may be the overall hardest, at least for me, at least to the top of the hump.  The second disk of ""Road to Victory"" has a period of more intense climbs, but this climb is longer and doesn't give much recovery time until its over.

The ride starts out almost immediately with a hill, and then continues on for maybe 10 minutes with a fairly steep climb in resistance that you are looking forward to end.  Then, as Paul states in the video, it gets harder.  I think what really makes this video psychologically more difficult, at least for me, is that it never appears that you are on challenging terrain.  Its basically all one big hill so you never really see a change.  Plus it is mostly all wooded, which limits your view ahead.  This video seems to me to hit the 9 and 10 resistance settings on the dash more than any of the other of Paul's videos that I have, and seems to favor the higher half of the resistance settings through a good part as well.  After you reach the top of the climb it is more of a downhill effort instead, as ""over the hump"" would suggest.

I liked the new dash with the power readings.  It seemed more clear for some reason.  Also, a clicking sound has been added when a gear/resistance change occurs.  Initially I found this annoying, but quickly got used to it and found it helpful, especially in a hard climb where I might be focusing on pedaling rather than the screen.  You still need to look at the screen to see which way the gears are changing.

I didn't find the guest commentary as interesting on this video as some of the others, mainly because it related more to triathalons rather than biking specifically.  Also, for some reason the guests' voice seemed to be at times overpowering his microphone and the rest of the audio, which can be distracting.  But as always there are three audio tracks so this issue is easily solved.

Overall, another great training video, and proof that Paul is continually refining his already great product.",1360195200,,2161,4.4529262086514
8516542,3,B007HAWIHY,"I was excited to use this product using my spin bike at home. My expectations were cut short due to the following:
- First 30 mins of the video which is climbing the ""Hump"" was pretty intense, but as you go over pass the ""Hump"", it was downhill from there. There were some small hills which makes you work harder but other than that, you're ""spinning"" to the end.
- Paul has a riding partner, but you don't see him through out the ride, but with commentary on, you'd hear them both talking about how he (the riding partner) became an avid cyclist/triathlon). I was hoping they would talk more about some technics along the way.
- Music was OK. Need more upbeat.

This won't be the last time I'd buy his video, i will try another one that might be harder/more intense to get me really workout on my spin bike.",1358208000,,808,4.315789473684211
8516543,5,B007HAWIHY,"Just like the title says, this is another great, beautiful, and difficult ride done by Paul Gallas. I love his videos. I am now spoiled by the HD ones and and am getting more spoiled every time I buy one of his newer videos. I love the rear view look too that he has added and plays sometimes during the ride, although I can't focus on it too long because I start feeling dizzy. I love how challenging this ride is. It is very pretty and makes me feel like I am there. I also love the ride info that is provided at the bottom of the screen. It keeps me challenging myself and focused. I do wish that the white lettering was slightly larger since I cannot always see it very well and already have my trainer pretty close to the tv. On a side note, I have wondered how rpm's compare to cadence, since I have a cadence sensor but nothing to track rpm's like the ride info includes. In an ideal world (which the economy is far from these days), I would love to see some European virtual rides by Paul and some other ones throughout the US (i.e. Hawaii, Oregon, etc). Perhaps a business trip tax deduction:) PS: Although this was a Christmas gift, I had to break it out early. Lori",1355616000,,1176,4.207964601769912
8516544,5,B007HAWIHY,"Another great video. There are no super steep climbs in this one, but there are plenty of rollers. And one big ""hump."" Its an hour and a half video with lots of great commentary from Paul and his guest David. Great insight into what it takes to be an all around cyclist. ALL of these videos are worth adding to your collection. They take you from inside a dingy room indoors and outside onto the road. You look up and the video is over. The cues and camera abilities just get better with each ride. Since I can't ride outside, why not bring the ride outside to me. Highly recommend!!",1350604800,,583,4.3090909090909095
8516545,3,B007HAWIHY,"This is a great ride with fantastic scenery but only ok music. Obviously music is a very personal thing but I don't find that the tunes on this ride amp me up like the tunes on his other rides. BUT and this is a fair and balanced ""But"" the scenery on this ride is Georgeous and breathtakingly beautiful.
Good exercise and fun ride for middle of a snowy day when your bored to tears on your indoor trainer.",1350345600,,405,4.205128205128205
