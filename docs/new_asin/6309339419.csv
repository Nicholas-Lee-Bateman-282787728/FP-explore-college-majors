Emmy winner Ross Shafer is a customer service professional. If he doesn't give his comedy club audiences what they've come for--laughter--he's out of business. Sharing his experience, he takes our camera crew on a fast-paced tour of businesses where customer service is key--and other locations where the service ends up scaring customers away!

Attitude is a major factor in making your customers feel like more than just customers. Coming at customers with sarcasm or derision will probably send people fleeing from your establishment. A happy image both in person and over the phone puts your employees and your business in a positive light.

Learn the following customer service skills:

  * Make a good first (and lasting) impression.
  * Show competence by listening to customers.
  * Create personal relationships with your customers.
  * Give customers more service than they expect.
  * Resolve conflicts quickly.
  * Thank customers for their feedback.

This customer service training video is fun to watch, but the learning points are not obscured by the humor. Every viewer will be reminded of the many ways to show customers that they're ""number one.""

Guarantee: Employees will learn about the small steps they can take to let customers know that they are appreciated.",1264896000,,1394,5.259090909090909
