372706,2,6301865782,"I bought this concert DVD thinking that, as a younger guy, Merle would have a better voice.  But the audio and video are clearly old.  The better concert is when he was older because the audio and video are great in that concert DVD.  I think that one was at Billy Bob Texas.",1347580800,4,275,4.150943396226415

He is in great voice and overall performance.",1197158400,4,108,4.190476190476191
372708,3,6301865782,We are huge Merle Haggard fans but I won't recommend this DVD.  The concert was disorganized and there was so much unrelated business going on in the background it was hard to watch.  The performances were unenthusiastic (except for Bonnie Owens' solo).  Merle and The Stangers are better than this so I will stick to the good ones.,1188950400,19,332,4.689655172413793

7816261,5,6301865782,"This dvd is great. The Hag is a favorite of mine and always will be. Just listening and watching him brings back
memories of years gone by. It also shows what Country Music is supposed to be like. Also, the packaging was perfect
and again, thanks for all you do for your customers.  Jerry.",1490054400,2,289,4.351851851851852

7816266,5,6301865782,"I saw Merle in 1984 in Austin--Willie showed up at that concert too. This video tranported me back to that time. It was cool watching the stagehands during the video concert, to see what they did. And Merle's singing was excellent in this video. Well worth the few dollars for the DVD. Years ago, I purchased this same concert on VHS.",1419206400,,334,4.491803278688525
