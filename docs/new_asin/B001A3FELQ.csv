8275916,4,B001A3FELQ,"I was hoping for a real documentary on Human progress. Instead, this is for the most part a videotaped panel with 3 experts.  If you like Ferguson, this is still great. All he said is brilliant (as usual) but I would rather see him in a documentary.

If you really want to see him in a well done documentary I'd recommend ""The World Without US"" - a film that shows what would happen should the US withdraw its military from around the world.
