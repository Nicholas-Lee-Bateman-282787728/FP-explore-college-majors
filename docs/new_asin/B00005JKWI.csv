1438790,4,B00005JKWI,"I like B-movies. I hunt them down, I MST3K them, and from that standpoint Blade 2 was pretty good. There's little plot, some sharp and funny dialogue, and some more of the hack fest that the first one offered. All in all the film is very enjoyable, and good for a laugh. The problem is that I'm not so sure that was the intent of the film.
 Blade is still a shallow and two-dimensional character, and bringing Whistler back when I was under the impression that he shot himself in the head with a silver bullet in the first one seemed kind of gimmicky, and cheap in the vain of the Search for Spock. I hate it when they bring dead people back to life in sequels. Never the less a lot of the better moments of this film were courtesy of Whistler and his interaction with Scud.
 If you're looking for a deep movie with a lot of character development then look somewhere else. The love interest is barely noticeable, you see Blade and Neesa eyeing each other but it never gets any further than that, which does not justify the tragic romantic ending by any means. Never the less B movies are not about plot, or character, that's why they call them B-movies, and that's what Blade 2 really is. Something that the original film failed to do. The movie is stupid, but still manages to be a lot of fun at the same time, despite some painfully CGI fights scenes that were absolutely unnecessary. People on wires look better!",1026259200,2,1415,4.396946564885496
1438791,5,B00005JKWI,"Well I'm a huge Blade fan and I wasn't dissapointed when with this movie. I was kind of scared to go see it because it seems sequels always get screwed up but this one was pretty good. The first one is one of my favorite movies of all time and I still like it more then the second but the Blade 2 is still awesome. Great fight scenes, the only thing I wish they changed was the way the vampires died, I think it was much better looking in the first. I wish they had another villian like frost in this one... not very good villians in this one. The new vampires looked cool but their character wasn't developed as well as frost or other vampires in the first. If you liked the first you'll probably like this one but still which they changed some things.",1026000000,,753,4.164383561643835
1438792,5,B00005JKWI,"This drastically under publicised classic is mos def one to watch, this blade/preditor 2 cross combines all the classic acting talent of blade (wesley snipes) and whistler (kris kristofferson) aswell as adding new actors such as reinhardt (ron pearlman-aliens ressurection)to spice up an already impressive cast. this truly brilliant film is a new type of hybrid cross of films to lead the way in the film industry, up there with the greats such as the matrix, and boys in the hood etc etc. the soundtrack does not reflect the film as many songs where left off the album (in fact, all the good ones were) so don't be disheartened. this truly brilliant, blood ridden, fast, action packed film will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way thru and will keep you begging for more vampire violence in the form of mass masacres. mos def one to watch. don't miss its release!!!",1025481600,,877,4.664516129032258

1438885,4,B00005JKWI,"I saw Blade in theaters when it came out, and LOVED it.  Bought the VHS, and then the DVD.  Watch it every so often.  I acquired ""Blade: Trinity"" a while back and thought I had Blade II but it turns out either I didn't or lost it so I hit up Amazon for this DVD. After watching the 3 Blade Movies I place Blade II as my least favorite. I thought the whole ""Reaper"" storyline was slightly out there.  I did enjoy the idea of a Vampire ""Special Forces"" team devoted to hunting down Blade.  It's a good movie on its own but I think its the low point in the Blade story arc across the 3 movies.",1490832000,,590,3.9661016949152543

1438917,5,B00005JKWI,"The best of the Blade franchise. Wesley Snipes is excellent in the second edition of this darkly entertaining series, and his presence is the epitome of ""cool"". Ron Pearlman and Leonora Varella, are excellent co-stars that help complete the high-energy ensemble of actors in search of a ""new"" strain of vampires that threaten our world. The special effects are amazing and even better than the original Blade. The storyline has more twists and turns to keep the interests of the viewer glued to the screen as the story unfolds, and the ending is spectacular. I am a swordfight expert, for some reason, and love any movie where duels are staged using them. Some of the best have been Jose Ferrer in ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", where he talks to his opponent using poetry while defeating him in battle. The long fight scene in ""Scaramouche "", between the star Stuart Granger, and Mel Ferrer, the scene in the castle between Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Ronald Coleman in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"", and last but not least, the fight between Tyrone Powers and Basil Rathbone in ""The Mark of Zorro"". Blade II fight choreography puts them all to shame.",1464566400,,1135,4.795918367346939

1438968,4,B00005JKWI,"So we have definitely been on a Del Toro kick, revisiting all the movies Pan's Labyrinth (2006), Mimic (1997), but starting with  Pacific Rim (2013) earlier this year. We've even watched the Hellboy animations, which don't quite match the flavor of the movies, but instead are closer to the anthological feel of the comics.

Blade II is likely the most commercial Del Toro film, so much so that I feel it is not necessarily superior to Blade (1998), but simply with a different sensibility. Blade I is quite enjoyable on its own. Pacific Rim (2013) is also quite commercial, and frankly the Top Gun aspect of it is absolutely at odds with my own sensibilities.

If there is a failing with the film it is probably the James Bondian aspect of putting the hero in peril only to suspend the peril for no reason whatsoever, or that of ""revealing"" nonsensical characters and situations just for the sake of... well, I don't even know what.

Even then Blade II is an organic development of the themes present from the start (a reluctant vampire, demon, etc.) the struggle of one species with another and the lengths to which they are willing go to survive. We do also get the theme of racial purity, which also might be said to appear in Hellboy II.

On the positive side we get some really neat monsters in the Reapers. Although the vampires in Blade are never romanticized or truly sexy, but they are presented as having their own (imperial) civilization*, the reapers and even the head vampire bring back the Nosferatu type, and a truly horrifying and vicious mutation.

We get some cool eye candy, some dumb situations, but the director's artistic vision present in his other work is not really compromised. It remains cotton candy, but has a solid base to build upon.

*In that sense they retain the aristocratic aspects of the original Dracula. The genetic purity creates an almost Nazi-like ambiance, which is not necessarily developed.",1446422400,,1936,4.778443113772455

1439159,5,B00005JKWI,"If there's one thing I can say about Guillermo del Toro movies on the Blu Ray format, it's that you're pretty much guaranteed to get a very nice transfer and presentation, both in audio and video. Check out the Blus for Pacific Rim and Hellboy II: The Golden Army for proof. Blade II is no exception on this front, with a crisp 1080p image and 7.1 surround sound that makes this disc a beast. There's a wealth of extras on the disc, most of them carried over from the initial DVD release. It comes with no less than three audio commentaries and a slew of video features that are all worth a watch. The surround sound is worth mentioning again simply because it's so active throughout the movie. If you're looking for an action film with great and busy surround sound to give your speakers a workout than Blade II is a good selection. The movie itself is pretty good actually and some may argue about whether or not it's better than the first. I may have to side with those that favor the sequel over the original which is funny because when I first saw Blade II, I HATED it. It wasn't until I watched it again that I fully began to appreciate it for its great cast of characters and especially intriguing villain, Nomak played by Luke Goss.

Again, this is a great Blu Ray of a better than average sequel. If you're looking to be impressed technically, Blade II's sound and picture will do just that.",1408838400,,1400,4.405405405405405

1439161,5,B00005JKWI,"Blade II was an easy follow up to the original. Even 12 years later it's still fun to watch. It's also somewhat surprising at which young actors were in it that are current stars. First, Tony Curran as Priest. Cerrently he plays Datak Tarr in Defiance. Next is Norman Reedus as Scud. He is probably better known for his role on AMC's Walking Dead as Darryl. Then there's Luke Goss who plays Carl Lucas in the Death Race videos.

The story is not surprisingly original, however, face it Blade fans, we are there for the action. In that, it does not let us down. Ron Perlman plays his typical two-dimensional character. He could be Hellboy, Clay Morrow or Reinhardt.

If your're after thrills, this movie is chalk full. If it's a datenight live story, you best keep moving.",1407715200,,771,4.579710144927536

1439166,4,B00005JKWI,"In the interim, Blade (Wesley Snipes) has been searching high and low for his old buddy Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who did NOT die in the first film.  Apparently, while attempting suicide, the idiot missed and was captured by some foreign vampires and tanked for good measure.
The usual killing spree ensues (ashes to ashes), as Blade cuts a swath through the vampire population.  Before you can say pop goes the weasel, Blade is enlisted to help a crack team of vampire assassins called the Bloodpack (catchy name aside, their original intent was to kill him) to find and destroy a rogue thingy that is not quite a vampire.  This variant is called a Reaper (Luke Goss) and his intent is to wipe out vampires.  Blade is convinced to join the pack when it is `suggested' that Reapers will go after humans once they've decimated the vampire community.  Joining Blade is a new sidekick named Scud (played with obvious intent by Norman Reedus).  Ron Perlman also puts in an appearance as Reinhardt, a vampire with a grudge.  The story is more interesting this time because of the reapers.  Otherwise, loads of action throughout, a literal bloodbath (better than a Jacuzzi).  And no surprise, this new batch of vampires is also after Blade's blood.  If he just bottled it he would have made a fortune.",1400803200,,1299,4.7847533632287

Anyway, as usual Amazon says there are no special features in their description.  When I'm buying blu-rays, the quantity or lack of features and commentaries is a major factor in my decision, so Amazon isn't very helpful most of the time, since you often can't see the back of the package.
This is, I believe, the only one of the three films to have any features.  There are several relevant featurettes and count them...THREE audio commentary tracks.  If you like extras, this is a good one, probably because Del Toro directed the film.",1391472000,3,760,4.7272727272727275
1439190,5,B00005JKWI,"Nostalgia aside (how old is this movie?) and my slight fanboyism (I love Del Toro's body of work), this Blu-ray transfer is still amazing.  If you liked it way back when, and you have the surround system to support the updated audio track, this is a must buy.

I won't bore you with a full review of the movie since it's so old, but it's better than Blade I and Blade Trinity.

REVIEW:
- Film: 5/5
- Video: 4/5
- Audio: 5/5
- Extras: 2/5

PROs:
- It's Blade II.
- The DTS Master Audio 7.1 rocks. Turn that subwoofer up during the fight scenes!
- The video transfer is as good as it gets, film grain and all.
- At $9, it's a cheaper than lunch and more fun.
- It's Blade II.

CONs:
- The Blu-ray case has zero frills.  You get a disc and some cheap plastic wrap.
- Not many extras by Blu-ray standards, but that's only really a con if you care about extras.
- Graphics are starting to show their age (then again, don't all movies).

In all seriousness, this movie surpassed my expectations.  The studio could have easily released a ""bargain bin"" edition and left it with the original audio tracks and weak transfer (I'm looking at you Tomb Raider), but they pulled out all the stops and I'm glad for that. It's a guilty pleasure that won't break the bank.",1391212800,,1254,4.239495798319328

1439193,5,B00005JKWI,"The opening of this movie contains some of the most kinetic and slickly choreographed action scenes in recent memory. Although I don't feel this movie as a whole matches the quality of the original, I do feel that the fantastic opening of Blade 2 surpasses that of the first Blade. Unfortunately, from here it goes a bit downhill, as this movie suffers from overuse of CGI. I don't feel there is any reason to create CG animations of people fighting, the results of which are unnatural scenes of wonky computer-generated figures punching and kicking each other.

Still, the quality of direction, gritty action, witty dialog, and fantastic creature design keeps this movie from becoming your run-of-the-mill martial arts/horror flick which have become so clich with knock-off movie franchises like Resident Evil and Underworld. Wesley Snipes is menacing as Blade, and keeps this movie grounded with inventive fight choreography brought to life with real athleticism and genuine martial arts expertise. You won't see any floaty, ballerina-like, wire-fu kicks in this movie. No, when Blade and the main villain fight, they genuinely look like they're trying to kill each other!

Del Toro infuses the atmosphere with a sense of fear and dread very reminiscent of classic horror movies by Ridley Scott and John Carpenter. You always feel like there is something lurking in the darkness, waiting to grab you.

The cast--which includes Ron Perlman, Norman Reedus, and Donnie Yen--is awesome. Unfortunately, some of them seem to be a bit under-utilized. Donnie Yen is a perfect example of this. It's disappointing, given how highly-acclaimed he is as a martial artist superstar, to see such a brief performance.

When the original Blade was released in 1998, it brought something new and fresh to the vampire mythos. Although brought down by overuse of CGI, Blade II continues in the tradition that the original began. Despite its flaws, it's an exciting flick that, at times, will push you to the edge of your seat.

This DVD, despite it being fairly inexpensive on Amazon when I bought it (it was around $5--not anymore), seems to have a lot of extras. This set contains two disks worth of content, which includes commentary, a documentary, and music video. If this inexpensive copy of Blade II had merely provided a simple transfer of the movie with no extras, I would have found it adequate. But, this set provides much more than that. Based on the low price, I would highly recommended it.",1390089600,,2486,5.024271844660194

1439195,4,B00005JKWI,"A major virus is sweeping the through the vampire community and transforming its hosts into creatures called Reapers, who have a thirst for blood worse than vampires, are near invulnerable, and who can also pass the virus on to victims of their own. Worse, they feed on both human and vampire alike. Desperate to stop these creatures, the vampire community strikes a truce with Blade and gets him to help them fight these awful creatures. As Blade carves his way through the Reapers, he finds out their sinister origin and must put a stop to the Reaper vampires once and for all.

The thing with sequels is you gotta go bigger and better than the first one. Its not always easy and usually fails, however there are exceptions and Blade II is such an exception. Instead of just simply pitting Blade against more vampires, he now has to fight alongside them and stop a common enemy. How does that go? The enemy of my enemy is my friend? Thats whats happening here and is a unique take on the vampire mythos and takes Blade to the next level.

Wesley Snipes is back as the Daywalker, and does everything right in this flick like he did in the first movie: tough, sweet action, martial arts, swordplay, solid acting and more. Its always great when you can see the actor enjoys what they're doingor convinces you they areinstead of merely phoning it in as is sometimes the case when an actor keeps reprising a role.

Kris Kristofferson is back, too, which is awesome because Whistler is a big part of the first movie and this one mightve felt hollow without him. How they bring him back after what happened in the last movie was also clever.

The Reaperstotal killers with sweet SFX, brutal savagery and they make the regular vampires look like a bunch of modern day angsty vamps by comparison. Always a good thing when you up the ante on the bad guy.

I really liked this sequel, especially because, like I said, it had a fresh take on the slayer-vs-vampire mythos and Im all about fresh takes. The story moved along at a good clip, kept me engaged, and makes me have a good time every time I have a Blade movie marathon.

Awesome stuff, Blade II.

1439243,4,B00005JKWI,"This movie starts with a seemingly ill man going into a blood bank to make a transaction. It becomes clear the ""workers"" are really sadistic vampires out for an easy meal but they soon have the surprise of their life -  death is only seconds away. The brief glimpse of this man is the first showing we get of who will be the true villian in the film.

 Blades new partner is a brainy young man who I thought would be a key player but after the beginning he's really not focused on a whole lot. Blade and his crew are summoned to a vampire meeting where they are told help is needed. Blades worst enemy - the vampires - now need his aide to wipe out a new superbreed of demonic vamps.

These are worse than the original - creepy as hell looking, resistant to silver and garlic, and are cursed with an insatiable appetite. Once they devour the vamps they'll turn to the humans for food. One bite from these things to a human being or another vampire will turn the victim into the villian. Before realizing this Blade didn't care, but now he is forced to join the undead army.

 While Blade doesn't trust the vampires as far as he can throw them (which is pretty far) he agrees to the plan and meets a special task unit that have been training for 2 years. They are equipped with their own arsenal and fighting techniques; one of the 2 main characters from the group is the daughter of the vampire ""president"". The second is bald, buff dude Dieter Reinhardt (Ron Perlman) who has a major attitude and played on Alien Resurrection with about the same personality.

 The plot is easy to follow. It's more about action (like the first). Since the new breed is harder to kill, they have to get pretty damn creative in their choices of slaughter. Blade doesn't seem as tragic and disturbed as he was in the first, and in a way seems more at peace with himself.

 The CGI is outstanding and used all the time. The blood continously splashes on screen. The gore is high; obviously the MPAA looked the other way.

 We also have more insight into the vampire characters. While in part 1 they were simply shown as evil little things, here we find some decent ones. Showing killing as a survival technique that must be done, not something enjoyed. this is something the original lacked a bit, this one improving upon.

 The ending was stunning and sad, and then ending with laughter and another light note.

The action sequences in this film are plentiful and well choreographed, and definitely you can see how skillful Guillermo del Toro is at directing this type of film - there's a scene in a vampire night club that follows the action happening in about four or five different locations simultaneously that is a hoot to watch.

It looks like all of the special features from the DVD Platinum Edition of this film were ported over - the interviews with Guillermo del Toro are pretty funny and entertaining themselves.

A new form of vampire called Reapers are desolating the vampire population throughout Eastern Europe.  In a desperate attempt to stop this seemingly impossible foe the vampire nation enlists Blade to try and stop them.  He is given command of the Bloodpack, a specialized group of vampire commandos that were actually trained to kill Blade.  The Reapers put the uneasy partnership between Blade and the Bloodpack to the test as they prove to be as resilient as they are bloodthirsty with a secret agenda all their own.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-II/dp/B007QWF26C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade II</a>&nbsp;in some ways is a superior film to the original while in other ways it falls well short.  The main villain, Nomak (Luke Goss) is nowhere near as much fun or deliciously evil as Deacon Frost.  Nomak is setup as a bloodthirsty monster but by the end he's more of a tragic victim which robs the film of a certain amount of viciousness.  Where Blade II excels past its predecessor is in terms of the rest of the cast, its special effects, and direction.  Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson return but it's the addition of the great Ron Pearlman that really pushes Blade II to the next level.  Also joining the cast is Norman Reedus (The Walking Dead), Matt Schulze (Fast Five), and Thomas Kretschmann (Wanted), they're not all names you'll recognize but you'll definitely know their faces.

The believability of CGI made huge strides between the first and second Blade films.  There are still some questionable CGI in Blade II but nothing that really takes you out of the flow of the film.  Mexican director Guillermo del Toro brings an even bleaker and darker style to the franchise going as far as changing the aspect ratio from 2.35:1 to 1.85:1.  Guillermo del Toro's employs a much more fluid camera work than what was seen in the original and really tries to envelope you in the action.

The stylistic changes made by del Toro don't always lend itself to making a great looking Blu-ray transfer.  If you watched Blade and Blade II back-to-back you might initially think that Blade has a superior transfer but you'd be wrong.  The transfer of Blade II is just as good as the one found on Blade it's just that Blade II is shot much differently than the original.  Blade II is a softer looking film than its predecessor; it's also much darker with long periods of the film taking place in gritty and murky sewers.  Does that type of environment lend itself well to HD?  Not really, but it was an intentional choice by the director and his cinematographer and this Blu-ray is a good representation of the how Blade II looked theatrically.  Colors, particularly reds pop very well, the grain is appropriate, and detail especially on close-ups is very good.  Black levels can be a little too dark at times leading to some information loss but that again has more to do with the stylistic choice of the filmmakers than the Blu-ray transfer.  I'd rather have the studio do nothing than overzealously tinker with the picture leading to too much digital manipulation.

I thought the original Blade sounded spectacular but Blade II is even better.  The 7.1 DTS-HD MA track is easily demo material for anyone interested in giving their setup a thorough workout from head to toe.  Dialogue is firmly centered while the three front channels make slicing and dicing through the Reapers sound easy as pie (or should I say `humans'?).  If you're lucky enough to have a 7.1 setup the added surround channels don't go to waste as they all are given plenty to do while not sounding gimmicky in the process.  The LFE channel will give your downstairs neighbors reason to come knocking on your door since they'll think their ceiling is probably about to cave in.  It's a great sounding disc especially if you like listening to a rib cage break apart in graphic audio detail.

The commentary tracks, deleted scenes, music videos, trailers, assorted featurettes, and The Blood Pact documentary are all ported over from the 2002 DVD release.  A new HD Director's Notebook and interview between Guillermo del Toro and writer David S. Goyer called Blade II: Blood Brothers is also included.  Pretty much everything you'd ever want to know about Blade II can be found here in one way or another.  Not all the material has aged well and you might get a sense of dj vu since some material is redundant but it's still a very decent supplement package even if most of it is showcased in SD.

The Blu-ray presentation is strong across the board; the video might not blow you away but it is a good representation of the source material, the audio is second to none, and the special features have some new HD material added to an already informative package.  If you're a fan of Blade II this is really a no brainer, if you're a newcomer to the world of Blade I still recommend it as a blind buy.",1344470400,12,5772,5.087141339001063

1439335,4,B00005JKWI,"After reading many of the reviews and especially those made for the Blu-ray release, I felt I needed to comment as I found a lot of opinions, but few that summarized what I wanted to know. That said, I am not rating the movie itself; you're big boys and girls and can make those decisions yourself. I am rating the quality of the product.

Is it better video quality than the DVD version? Yes. A DVD is lower resolution and has been compressed (i.e. data discarded causing loss of picture quality) to fit on a DVD disc. It can potentially be compressed even more to allow for extras. The Blu-ray was taken from the same master copy as the DVD and was upconverted. This means the Blu-ray version is of better quality than the upconverted DVD. Since I own both DVD and Blu-ray editions, I can confirm the quality is better, looking at items such as faint wisps of smoke, sparks shooting from dying vamps, sharpness between light and dark colors, reflected images, etc.

If you are someone who buys movies more for the other stuff on the disc, you will be disappointed as there is no menu or extras. It shows a screen where the menu would be stating the move will begin in moments. Once it starts, you only have the basic control menu (up arrow menu). Also, this is just an upconverted version with no new remastering so some items will still be a little blurry on the edges (like some of the closer sparks when a vamp dies).

All in all, I had to give this product 4 stars. I subtracted 2 stars from 5 because it was not remastered nor had extras, but added 1 star because they gambled and released it on Blu-ray in this economy and after Wesley's incarceration.",1295222400,4,1660,4.4183006535947715

These mutant ""Reapers"" are an evolved breed of vampires that hunt both humans and bloodsuckers alike, posing a huge threat to both species. Guillermo Del Toro steps in for Stephen Norrington this round, bringing with him a slicker look, even more fast-paced action, and a ton of bloody gore. Goyer has also eliminated the cheesier elements and over the top dialog that bogged down his first script. The success of the original allowed for a greatly expanded budget, which Del Toro has poured in to the elaborate set designs and improved FX. The Reapers benefit most from these upgrades, possessing excellent make-up work that crosses the eerie rat-like features of Max Schreck's Count Orlok with the deadly mandibles of The Predator. BLADE 2 is one of the rare series sequels that outdoes the original on every level, making it the strongest of the three films.

1439399,4,B00005JKWI,"Listen to the director commentary, and you'll hear Guillermo del Toro saying that he wanted the Blade sequel to be a fun, gory, comic-booky experience.

Well, he succeeded in the way that only Guillermo del Toro can. While the first movie about the Marvel vampire-hunter was dark and gritty, ""Blade II"" is gloriously gory and full of rapid-fire violence, unashamed of its animeish action sequences and tongue-in-cheek humor (""Catch you later!""). Wesley Snipes and del Toro give it a suitably monstrous charm, although David Goyer's leaden dialogue bogs down many promising scenes.

While a monstrous hooded vampire preys on other vampires, Blade (Snipes) manages to track down his vampirized mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and cures him of his vampirism. Then a pair of vampire ninjas arrive, bearing a message for Blade: ancient vampire lord Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann) wants to meet with him. Turns out there's a monstrous vampiric mutation called the Reapers loose -- highly contagious, really disgusting, and preys on humans and vampires alike. Blade reluctantly agrees to work with the elite vampire assassin squad called the Bloodpack.

Of course, tensions run high between the vampires and the little gang sworn to kill them -- especially when they arrive at the rave club House of Pain and lose some of their number. Blade takes on the Reapers' leader, Jared Nomak (Luke Goss), only to discover that there are some nasty secrets behind the Reapers' origins. And Damaskinos' plans are far nastier and further-reaching than anyone could have guessed.

Those expecting a copy of the first ""Blade"" movie should leave the building now. Guillermo del Toro's direction gives ""Blade II"" a very unique flavour all its own -- it's faster, more grotesque, more fantastical, and more infused with quirky humor. The one sour note is the magical return of Whistler at the beginning, where it turns out that whoops, he wasn't QUITE dead and he's getting better. Contrived much?

And del Toro has fun with the action -- lots of grotesque gore (those flip-out Reaper mouths), anime-style action (Blade garrotes a vampire on a motorcycle) and highly destructive gun battles. The first four-fifths of the story are just mindless shoot-'em-up-and-burn-up-to-ashes Reaper-hunts, but it mutates in the last act. Suddenly we're faced with a vampiric tale of betrayal, revenge and Grecian-style tragedy.

The big problem with this movie? Goyer's dialogue is hit or miss. Sometimes it's hilarious (""You're human."" ""Barely. I'm a lawyer""), and sometimes it sounds like he put it in because it looked cool on paper (""There's an old saying: Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer""). Much of the time, it's the latter.

Wesley Snipes seems to be having a good time here, with lots of wild action and some wry humour (""Now you got an explosive device stuck to the back of your head""), and Leonor Varela provides a hint of possible romance as an autopsy-performing vampire princess. And the whispery-voiced Luke Goss manages to take a truly repulsive character (""so... so sweet!"") and give him an air of tragedy.

In fact, most of the acting is pretty good in this movie, although most of the actors don't get a lot to do (Donnie Yen is particularly underused), though Ron Perlman is wonderfully loathsome as a neo-Nazi vampire who gets on Blade's bad side. Norman Reedus is intensely annoying as Scud, though -- you'll spend a lot of time hoping that someone shoots him by accident.

""Blade II"" is a very different beast than its predecessor, and del Toro does a great job with some truly mediocre scripting. Worth seeing if you have a strong stomach.",1233705600,,3650,5.07

1439403,3,B00005JKWI,"Let me make one thing clear: This movie has killer action! I will not deny that and if it weren't for other aspects of the movie it would have gotten a higher rating just for the action. Unfortunately all the bad stuff cancels out the good stuff for me.

There are some things I just can't forgive and one is plain stupidity and lack of continuity. The people in this movie are dumb as dirt. At the beginning of Blade we have him fighting off vampires wearing these neat ""day suits"" that protect them from UV light. Funny thing is they conveniently forget they have these useful garments when they have to hunt during the day. Talk about stupid. Not only that, it is established that the big bad hybrid vampires that are the main focus of Blade 2 can only be killed by UV light, yet the idiots still pack a ton of firepower instead of a mess of flashlights. Man... brainless testosterone sure does flow thick in that movie. Another thing I felt was overkill was Blade's new chemical formula he laces all of his weapons and bullets with (well the bullets are packed with it... not laced) and the fact that a single drop of this stuff is apparently enough to BBQ a vampire's entire body. Just seems like they are pushing the envelope here.

The plot is somewhat derivative and only gives Blade a reason to kill things. Granted Blade came from a Marvel comic book and the movie does attempt to stick with a comic book styled story, but come on! Give us some depth here! There was a painfully predictable love interest that doesn't do much for the movie at all. There are also a few ""surprise"" plot twists that are also utterly predictable and bring nothing to the table. And as much as I like Wesley Snipes and as much I like what he brings to the character, the perpetual ""cool pose"" theme gets old. Just once I would like to see Blade tie his shoe or even just stand still in a non-cool way. Quick Blade! While you answer the phone. Strike a pose!!

Still in all of the story content bashing I make this movie has some of the greatest action scenes ever. The fighting is intense and the choreography is stylish without being campy. I really mean it. The action in Blade 2 is awesome. The special effects are well done for the most part and little things like the lighting, camera angles and sound are also done well. In other words the action scenes and production values are top notch... except for the soundtrack.  The soundtrack is nice but it felt forced fed. It seems every time you're in a club and someone turns away for a minute a new song is on (conveniently being a song from the Blade 2 Soundtrack). One scene in this movie seems to pack at least five songs within ten minutes.

If you're into nothing but action, action, and ACTION then Blade 2 is just the movie for you. If you like both action and good story telling then be forewarned; you will have to weigh great action with lame plot and judge for yourself. Of course if you are all about content and care little for action you might as well save your money and wait until it comes on cable or broadcast TV. Blade 2 is a great action film and nothing more.",1204070400,,3123,4.359106529209622
1439404,4,B00005JKWI,"Blade II: derivative and unoriginal compared to Blade I.

I've been doing my own reading and retrospective on vampires over the last couple of weeks after seeing ""I am Legend"" with Will Smith. So I decided to go back to the iconic source. Having not read Dracula in years, I decided to read it again and began by comparing it to the contemporary (1992) movie version...Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" starring Gary Oldman. When I initially read the story as a child, I focused more on my stereotyped ""Dracula as performed by Bella Lugosi"" and not Stoker's original version. Reading Stoker in the original again I was charmed by the writing style and mores of the times. It holds up well. I then watched Coppola's movie which was tarted up and sexualized for today's audience. While Oldman's over the top performance is great fun to watch, the book is so much better. And if I were Stoker, I would be turning in my grave since the movie version barely follows the book and yet is ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"".

I then dragged Blade out of my movie collection. It is great campy fun. The first club scene is absolutely classic and really sets the mood for the rest of the movie. This is my favorite Wesley Snipes movie and he really delivers. And I loved Kris Kristofferson's dissipated, whiskey voiced character as Blade's compadre.

Next I picked up Blade II.  Definitely not as original or as good as the original Blade.  Kristofferson is back and lends the same whisky voiced cynical foil to Blade, but the rest of the movie didn't grab me as much. The first scene or two were fun, but the rest of the movie was only so so.  I couldn't find the bad guy ""or guys"" to be as compelling.  Overall rating: ""4"", but it is a derivative ""B"" movie which I can only recommend to true Snipes fans.",1202601600,2,1785,4.542056074766355

1439406,4,B00005JKWI,"Its hard for sequals to follow up on a great first installment, especially as one as good as Blade.  There are two direction to go, which is stick close to the first film, so that the 2nd seems too much like the first, or go in a differect direction, which might take the story too far from the first film.  Blade 2 does the latter, which doesn't provide as an exciting and tightly-developed story as the first Blade, but the tons of action of the first film remains, along with a lot of fun and excitement.

In Blade 2, a virus is transforming the vampires into a breed of supervampires, who are tougher, more agressive, and feed off of the normal vampires on a regular basis.  The leader of the vampire nation calls in an elite team of vampires known as the blood pack, who's leader is played by the impressive Ron Pearlman (Hellboy, Alien: Resurrection).  Among the team, is also a member played by Donnie Yen (Kill Zone, Shanghai Knights, Hero) for all you  martial art fans out there.  The team forms a very uneasy truce with Blade, in order to have some help defeating the supervampires and to seek out the vampire nation's leader's son - who has been turned into a supervampire too.  Whistler returns to the scene, which is a little confusing after the first film, since it appeared he shot himself.  However, Blade 2 decides to bring back his character and explains this in the beginning of the film.

Most of the movie is action packed, and great action at that.  The story isn't as sharp as the first, because a lot of screentime is devoted to hunting out the supervampires.  About 2/3 through though, story gets a bit more exciting and takes some twists and turns until the end.  As for the action, overall there is even more this time around, but several scenes overdo the cgi a little, and it is evident and distracting.  For fans of Donnie Yen, he has one very cool scene with exceptional choreography, and his character (though without any dialouge) is just bad (in the cool way).  Blade is not quite as cool as in the first film, but he's still just downright fun to watch.  He has a final fight against the leader's son, which is 3 minutes of one of the better fights I have ever seen.  I loved it more than the final fight in the first Blade.  This fight is even faster, harder, and longer.  It is definetly an edge of your seat fight.

Blade 2 may not take itself quite as seriously as the first Blade, but it is almost more enjoyable in a fun kind of way.  Tons of action, plenty of gore, and even some frightening moments make it seem scarier than the first Blade.  A hardcore fan may be dissapointed with the direction the sequal took, but someone looking for an enjoyable movie will still love this.",1184025600,3,2722,4.434607645875252

  Snipes and Goyer (the writer) have a good track.  Snipes explains the rationale of each of the fight scenes and has stories of stunt mishaps.

  The Director, Del Toro and the producer Frankfurt have a party on their track.  They mock some of Goyer's dialogue and applaud the stuff that worked just right.  A lot of fun.

Now that doesn't mean you can't make a good movie with gore and stuff in it.  Red Dragon is a good movie with lots of gore.  Unfortunately, Blade II just isn't a good movie.  It's nothing but vampires getting killed over, and over, and over again.  The plot never advances beyond vampires being slaughtered for a good hour and thirty minutes.  Doesn't matter that it has lost its shock value after the first five killings.  I was thinking the concept of horror films was to put characters in new frightening situations that they haven't yet adapted to so the shock value could carry on.  I mean, it doesn't take us 80 minutes to figure out that Blade can kill vampires.  And man, the effects are disgusting.

1439440,2,B00005JKWI,"I don't normally write reviews for movies I don't like but I made an exception in this case. I thought I'd rent the Blade series after catching part of Blade Trinity on HBO. This has got to be the worst of the three.  This was a one star movie up until the final act, which redeems the movie to two stars.

Wesley Snipes is such a boring actor...he shows no emotion whatsover. I know it's part of his character to be that way but the way he does it is just so BORING and uninspiring.  It's like watching paint dry.

To the funny parts...I found myself laughing out loud at Snipes cracking his neck before a fight, putting on his sunglasses (you'll see) and swinging his sword around just to put it back in its sheath.  Oh, and the stupid one liners (not just by Blade) were laugh out loud funny too.

The plot of the movie is that the vampires go to Blade for a truce so they can join forces to fight a new enemy - one that is stronger than them.  Blade agrees but is watching his back the entire time.  Whistler miraculously returns after killing himself in Blade I.  Long story short (spoiler), the new enemy was created by the vampire leader to rid their race of impurities...an experiment that got out of control.  After Blade kills the problem, of course the vampires turn on him and we're back to square one.

The action in this movie was just okay compared to action/martial arts movies of today. The fight scenes had the appearance of being choreographed rather than just being good fight scenes (i.e. ten enemies line up one by one to fight Blade instead of all jumping on him). If you want a good vampire movie - watch Underworld. Both of the Underworld movies are better than this one (even Evolution).  If you want to confirm that you've wasted two hours of your life...this is your movie.",1166227200,,1801,4.391566265060241
1439441,5,B00005JKWI,"Other than the explanation of where he (Blade) came from, who he and everyone else is, at the beginning, this film stands nicely on its own. for those of you that know the first one, then this opening explanation will be a little irritating (and a tad confusing, but it becomes clear later). The opening does smell strongly of franchise potential, being repeated in all the inevitable sequels still to come. Once past this though, we are lead through a massive fight and action scene that sets up the whole movie. and warns anyone who can't stand Hong Kong action scenes that they are probably watching the wrong screen.

The movie is essentially a platform for Snipes to have fun with his most renowned character. And he does so with very entertaining results. The movie has reasonably well rounded characters, suspicion piled on top of everyone, some amazing set pieces and a good sense of humour. The impact of all the blood and guts is reduced by the obvious fantasy of the fights (wires and SFX a lot of the time), but its still pretty powerful.

The lead performances are all very good, although some of the peripheral characters are a little too hammer horror. Luke Goss demonstrates great potential, although you would need to see him without the make up, body doubles, and special effects to really judge. and there is occasionally that urge to shout ""when will I be famous."" and the pure blood female vampire who takes a shine to blade is well worth being bitten by.

Overall it feels less like a sequel and more like a stand alone movie. with this in mind, I think its in fact better than the original (a rare example of the exception that proves the rule).",1153872000,19,1668,4.609427609427609
1439442,4,B00005JKWI,"'Blade II' is one of the few exceptions to the rule concerning sequels. This one rivals the first and posits the proverbial question ""which one is the best?"" My general rule is the original is always the best, but I accept my choice as subjective opinion and will posit the possibility that I might be wrong.

In installment two Blade joins forces with the Vampire Nation to destroy a new strain of the vampire virius which is producing a hybrid creature with a ravenous thirst that hunts both vampires and humans. Now fighting alongside the ""Blood Pack"", a group initally put together to hunt down Daywalker, the battle for the survival of both races is about to begin.

Positives: More action, more blood. Ron Perlman is amazing as Blood Pack wiseguy 'Reinhardt'. The scenes involving the interaction between Blade and Reinhardt are the best in the movie. Also, the inclusion of Hong Kong martial arts legend Donnie Yen as 'Snowman' was a great move. Unfortunately they killed him off much too early.

Negatives: The storyline and dialogue aren't as sharp and cohesive as the first (with the exception of the banter between Blade and Reinhardt). Leonor Varela is good as the vampire princess 'Nyssa', but I would've preferred the return of N'Bushe Wright to reprise her role as Blades' potential love interest Dr. Karen Jenson.",1150070400,6,1329,4.897777777777778
1439443,5,B00005JKWI,"The story in this film is very ornate, and its not as gratuitous as some might want you to believe. Blade and Co are summoned to help the regular Vampires fight off a ""Common Enemy"", which is part of a story that has many twists and turns.
Overall, its indeed very cool, is a notch up from the first BLADE, but has the ""Del Toro"" factor; that is, Del Toro seems to know he is ramping up a Franchise, but he also adds his own little twists and, in a word, perversions. Possibly the key addition to this world, is Del Toro's attempt to remove the sub-text of why Vampires do what they do, and to change the ""Anne Rice"" factor.
The DVD  extras are superbly plentiful in this  set. Two Sets of commentaries on disc one ( go for the Wesley Snipes and David  Goyer commentary first, in my view, since that is the most entertaining, and Del Toro's and Frankfurt's commentary is basically a lot of stuff that might be something you need to know as a fan, but not as a movie fan, maybe as a movie maker, and certainly shows that an excess of perversion never stopped amnyone from making good films).
Disc two has two main sections. There is no doubt that Del Toro is creative, however his little obsessions are a tad too much when viewed and heard in this context. The Making of Section is probably the best item to view first. And in the out-takes and deleted  scenes, the commentary is sometimes useful, but is often just plain off the yuck scale. So, its good to see the deletes and out-takes, which are, I think ( my opinion) mostly done correctly, some deletes are just on the level of ""Why?"", and the out-takes are fun.
All in all a pretty excellent Value Package. Done before Del Toro did  HELLBOY, it is very illustrative of his creative skill and indulgence in some weird obsessions.",1149897600,,1783,4.374622356495468
1439444,5,B00005JKWI,"""Blade"" is back. Whistler is back. And while vampires still suck, this sequel doesn't. (insert groan here)

Blade (Wesley Snipes), a half-vampire with a hatred toward the 'vampire nation' that created him, is recruited by the very same people he has vowed to destroy. New monsters called Reapers have surfaced, each bent on killing not only humans but vampires as well. Blade takes command of the all-vampire Blood Pack, a team of assassins originally being trained to kill Blade himself, and sets out take down the Reapers. While Blade knows that he will be shown forbidden secrets of the vampire nation in order to track down the Reapers to their lair, he is also very aware that those he leads will turn on him first chance they get.

Director Guillermo del Toro must have a thing for mutated, once-human monsters, so it's easy to see that a vampire film would be a natural attraction. While taking the reigns from ""Blade"" director Stephen Norrington and bringing Blade's creator Marv Wolfman onboard, this sequel to the 1998 hit takes everything from the original and cranks it up a notch. The fights are more superhuman than before, the attitudes are even bigger, and the vampire-killing violence is gratuitous a-plenty. Del Toro appears to have understood everything that made the original surprise hit work, and Wesley Snipes (also wearing the producers hat with his own Amen Ra Films) wouldn't have let him get very far if he didn't.

Not since ""The Matrix"" has a film come so close to looking like a live-action comic book. Wesley Snipes' portrayal of the title character has been improved by incorporating computer imagery to make him appear to jump higher, hit faster, and fall harder, all the while avoiding the 'wire fu' combat that the aforementioned ""Matrix"" has made standard in recent action films. Since the effect works and serves the story well, the kind of battle scenes that needed for future theatrical stories such as ""The Death of Superman"" and ""The Hulk"" seem like less of an undertaking. To maximize the effect, the virtual camera is able to show the action everywhere, as if the audience, too, were jumping, swinging, or in free-fall.

The worst offense that ""Blade II' commits may be lost opportunity. Leonor Varela (as Nyssa) seemed to have had a lot more story behind her character and her interest in Blade (and his interest in her) is left mostly unexplored; it feels like something might have been left on the cutting room floor. Donnie Yen (as Snowman) gets almost no chance to show off his considerable fighting skills. Even Kris Kristofferson's Whistler, while stealing some of the best lines in the film, doesn't get much screen time either (although getting him back into the story after his 'death' in the original film is both clever and important to the plot.) Fortunately, either you like this kind of film or you don't; if you're among the ones who do, there isn't much time to think about what isn't there while you're grinning from ear to ear.

A word of caution: there are a few horribly realistic scenes of vampire dissection, and they look as realistic as any battle damage shown in ""Saving Private Ryan."" Otherwise, look for Ron Perlman (as Rienhardt) at his best as Blade's main rival from the Blood Pack, and Luke Goss (as Nomak) playing the head Reaper as evil as they come. Between action, gunplay, fights, chases, special effects, and offensive one-liners, ""Blade II"" pleases on all levels. Here's hoping that this film is a sign of great blockbuster films to come this summer and not the high point by which all else will be measured.",1137369600,3,3590,4.83089430894309
1439445,5,B00005JKWI,"This one is the best of the Blade movies. It's darker, more violent and the villains are very cool. Not to mention the movie is highly entertaining. Thanks to G. Del Toro, he knows how to do a fine comic book movie!",1136160000,,215,4.142857142857143
1439446,5,B00005JKWI,"Since movie audiences made ""Blade"" a big success, it's no surprise that New Line Cinema would put writer David S. Goyer (""The Crow: City of Angels"" and ""Blade"") hard at work on crafting the sequel.  The key to a successful movie franchise is to try to keep most of the key players throughout, meaning the same actors for the same roles, so after getting David S. Goyer back to write the sequel, New Line pursued both Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson to return to the roles of Blade and Whistler.  Once these tasks were accomplished and the script was written, and director Guillermo Del Toro (""Mimic"") was tapped to helm the film, everything was set for the cameras to roll for ""Blade 2"".

Picking up a year or two after the first film, ""Blade 2"" puts Blade (Wesley Snipes) hot on the tail of some vampires who are hiding Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) somewhere, and keeping him alive as a vampire.  After freeing his mentor, Blade is confronted by an elite group of vampires known as the Bloodpack.  The Bloodpack informs Blade that a new enemy of vampires has emerged, but this new enemy called Reapers, are not solely after vampires, they hunt humans as well.  To stop the Reapers, Blade must join forces with his most hated enemies or let humanity be destroyed.

""Blade 2"" basically takes everything that was great about the first film, and improves upon it.  With the directing of Guillermo Del Toro and the terrific writing of David S. Goyer, the saga of Blade continues forward at break-neck speed.  Outstanding special effects that blow the first film away, and show a tremendous amount of imagination, ""Blade 2"" is a visual extravaganza.  Rarely does a sequel top its predecessor, but ""Blade 2"" succeeds in being the exception to the rule.  If you enjoyed ""Blade"", you will most definitely love ""Blade 2"", and just like ""Blade"", the ending leaves you just wanting more.

If u area a blade fan ,you're gonna see this vampire movie and say ""I m hungry for more"".The choriography is simply outstanding with swarms of super vampires called reapers encaptured in amazing scenes where blade has to take on more than a 100 of these baddies. The vampire effects for the reapers, their feeding habits and vampire features are way cool.

Whats even more cool is the war that blade and his so called new allies wage on the vampires. The scene depicted in the night club will keep u on the edge of your seat cause its like this- A team of savage vampires with big guns and blade himself with really awesome weapons hunting for bloodthirsty vampires in swarms. The fight scenes were equally amazing. The explict use of blood in various scenes brings the true original mood vampire atmosphere with bloodbaths,bloodwine and blood fountains. The weapons are really awesome and every scene has been really put into effort.

As mentioned before, the author didn't really keep this series open to that.  Although he mentioned that Blade would be out there, he seemingly had killed Whistler in the previous movie.

As mentioned in another review, this isn't what happened.  For this sequel to work, the vampires would have had to infiltrate his lair at the end of the other film.  That makes this sequel feel false.

Since others have spoken of the story, which wasn't too bad for a horror film, but it wasn't the most substantial, I would talk about the special effects.  There is a bit more computer-generated effects, which make some of the fighting moves seems a little cartoonish.  Further, in one fight, rather than seeing displays of the martial arts, we see a little bit of WWE professional wrestling.  Rather than give the fight a sense of power, it makes the fight a bit cheesy.

Going into the movie, I didn't have the highest of expectations, so it wasn't too bad.  If you are looking for a great film, this is not going to be it.  This is, however, not bad for a Friday night.",1133481600,,1240,4.531531531531532

This time around, Blade(again portrayed with power by Wesley Snipes)starts out once more out to destroy the vampires who created the lonely world in which he is doomed to live. But there is a twist to this tale: Blade is forced to double up with this deadly race in order to pursue a far greater threat to mankind, something that the vampire race is deathly afraid of. Without giving away the entire plot, I will say there are plenty of social messages in this story. If the first movie was erotic and sensual, this is insane with beauty, madness, and action. The special effects are skillfully and brilliantly done, the music and sets mind-boggling, the story packed with enough mayhem to last a lifetime.

1439488,3,B00005JKWI,"No point in rehashing the plot, so many other reviews already do that.  So I'll just stick to some points in the film that made no sense.

* Blade's vampire allies are upset to learn that Blade plans to use UV light weapons against the Reapers (a kind of super-vampire), because UV is harmful to Vampires too.  So the Vampires are wary of handling UV weapons.  BUT ... these same Vampires are heavily loaded with body armor.  In fact, early on in the film, they infiltrated Blade's lair while dressed in full body armor, everything covered from head to toe.  So, why can't they use that same body armor when handling UV weapsons?

I guess because they're really stupid vampires, since they only wear full body armor when they DON'T need it.  But when they go in with UV weapons, they foolishly don't use it, and naturally, many of them die.

* It's established that only UV light will kill Reapers, unless you can perform a very difficult sword trust to the heart.  So naturally, even at the film's final end battle, all the stupid vampires, and even Blade, only fight the head reaper WITHOUT UV light weapons, shooting countless useless bullets at the reaper even though they ALREADY KNOW it won't have any effect.

* How come there are NO female reapers?  You become a reaper by being bitten by one.  Now, vampires have traditionally prefered biting women (and reapers are a kind of super-vampire),  yet there are NO female reapers.  So, are reapers gay?

For that matter, there are VERY FEW female vampires.  Only two among dozens and dozens of male vampires.  What gives?

For that matter, in UNDERWORLD, there were NO female werewolves.  How come all these supernatural societies have so few females?  (Is that why they're always after our women?)

* The entire cast is really one-dimensional, most of all Wesley Snipes as Blade.  Leanor Varela is a bland female lead in this film, but was quite good in THE TAILOR OF PANAMA as a scarred former freedom fighter.  Ron Perelman was better in ALIEN RESURRECTION, showing more dimension despite playing a similar jaded tough-guy.  So it's not like these actors can't do better.",1120348800,,2128,4.717391304347826
1439489,3,B00005JKWI,"Your rotten reviewer will keep things short, children. In case the title fooled ya, this is the sequel to Blade - with Mr. Wesley Snipes (after watching his killer moves in this flick, I can't bring myself to even talk about him without the most earnest deference).  The ""Blade"" movies are set in a fun-house mirror version of our own world, in which a race of supercharged vampires (appearing little different than the everyday corporate variety) use their superior powers and wealth to rise to the top of the food chain.  Reprising his role as a daywalker, a sort of a mutant hybrid of human and vampire, Snipes wars against the Vampires (whom he calls suckerheads). As we learnt in the first ""Blade"" flick, Blade has all the powers that come with being one of the undead (including a killer fashion sense and an attitude to match; also he's really quick with a samurai sword and can absorb punishment that would kill lesser comic-book heroes). For reasons that have beguiled the vampires, he has none of their weaknesses. Blade uses killer moves, a samurai sword that seems to have a mind of its own, various gadgets and his attitude. Having dispatched a would-be Vampire king in the first movie, Blade is offered a chance to join the suckerheads when a mutant race of vampires called Reapers sets its appetites on everybody. With sideways-opening mouths, super-speed and a heart almost completely encased in solid bone (my stake won't work! Would you believe that this has never happened to me before?), the Reapers stalk vampires much as vampires hunted humans. Against the advice of his friends (including Kris Kristofferson as a crusty mortal who's endured so much suffering, he might as well be one of the dead) Blade joins the suckerheads in annihilating the Reapers. Dangers aside, Blade reasons that the pact will allow him to get closer to the vampires than he's ever been able to before, and anyway, should the reapers nosh the vampires to extinction, they'll add the human race to their menu.

So, why doesn't this movie completely rock? For one thing, it's so dark that it's hard to tell what's going on during the fast battle-scenes. Also, sexed-up for battle, our hero and his not-so-loyal band of undead foot-soldiers are encased in body-armor, armed to the teeth and shielded with their glasses - it's like watching a movie about action figures. The characters walk and talk like soulless AI characters in some hopped-up videogame. (Unfortunately, I caught this flick about the same time ""Demolition Man"" was on, and it was enlightening to see how much more spirited Mr. Snipes was Simon Phoenix in that flick.) Our badguys die in predictable and uninspiring CGI pyrotechnics, and speak either n a pastiche of four-letter words and pseudo-hard boiled tough speak (""yeah? Take off your sunglasses and say that, punk!""), or some of the overly dead-serious and clinically precise babble you'd find in either overpriced comics or on episodes of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"".  ""Blade II"" is supposed to be about tough guys, but it's not very tough at all. If ever a movie needed the ""Simon Phoenix"" treatment, this is it.",1118966400,,3139,4.8836772983114445
1439490,4,B00005JKWI,"Blade is a character from Marvel comics who is half vampire and (somewhat ironically) hunts down vampires and kills them.  Blade 2 leaves off where the first movie ends.  Blade is hunting his mentor Whistler who has been captured by vampires.  It is best not to ask why Whistler is still alive when is was obvisously killed in the first movie because questions like this will lead you in dead ends.  I think that the movie was trying to imply that Whistler escaped death because he was bitten by a vampire and that Blade later converted him back to a human.  Anyway, it is best not to worry about this gap in the plot.

Anyway, after saving Whistler, Blade is propositioned by a group of vampires to hunt done and destroy other vampires who feed on vampires and can fully open their jaws like a snake.  Throughout the movie, Blade hunts these ""super vampires"" while keeping a close eye on the vampires that he is working with because they are in face a group that has been training to kill him for two years.  Lots of action and a handful of suprizes ensure.

I'd say that the Blade series is of good quality in the recent Marvel superhero movies.  Blade 2 is not as good as Spiderman 2 but much better than the abomination that was The Hulk, and better than the draggy X-Men movies.  Wesley Snipes plays Blade as if the role were written for him.  This movie is a straight-laced action film and does not suffer a convoluted plot like the similar vampire movie Underworld did.  Instead it is just what you would anticipate from an action movie.  The only real problem that I had with the movie was that the romance between Blade and Lisa was so tepid that it did not add much to the movie.  I think that a love scene between the two was much needed.  But still, Blade 2 should be readily enjoyable to fans of the superhero genre.",1117756800,,1829,4.398809523809524

1439537,4,B00005JKWI,"For the first major motion picture of a Marvel Super Hero, the Comic book Enterprise chose Blade.  Surprisingly, he is a very low key, lesser-known `anti-hero' who never even had his own comic book.  Maybe that was the trick; use a hero that no one knew as a hero so the stigma of comic books wouldn't taint the popularity.  Let them find out he was born from the comic books AFTER they see the movie and like it.  Now, after several Marvel Character adaptations, including Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hulk, X-Men and the soon be released Elektra and Fantastic Four, Blade has pulled through well with two movies and a third one just released.  He is the only character so far to get three movies.  But soon that will change when Spider-Man and X-Men get their third installments.

As for Blade's second movie he takes on a new breed of Vampires that are tougher to kill and even tougher to stomach when they are finally defeated.  An astute friend of mine made the comparison; `Blade 2 is to Blade what Aliens is to Alien...more of them and more dangerous', an accurate comparison.  There is even a Special Forces group of Vampires that Blade cautiously teams up with to take them on, because apparently, the current vampires don't want to be killed off by the next evolution of their own kind.  Recruiting the `Day Walker' seems to be their best choice.  If he gets killed in the process, so be it, one less problem for them to deal with.

If there was any hint of character development in the first movie, this one totally side steps it and goes straight for the adrenaline rush.  With scads of vampires to be killed in overblown spectacles of blood and illuminating effects, lots of ammunition and explosives to be set off and plenty of faces to be smacked around by Blade's wheel kicks, not to mention snide remarks made between Ron Perlman's character and Blade, we certainly get the sense that this movie was created to wow us, and wow us it does.

1439538,5,B00005JKWI,"First off, I have to say that the director's commentary on this disc is the best damn commentary I have heard. Guillermo del Toro tells it just the way it is without any apologies. He is definitely my kind of director, and I am so glad that he has earned the well-deserved credit he needs in Hollywood to keep making his films the way he damn feels like making them.

Secondly, this is not Shakespeare ladies and gents. Simply, it is balls-out one of the best ""Dirty Dozen"" type action film to grace the screen in a while.

It is about the allegiances that a band of misfits must form in order to conquer over the greater evil. There are so many relationships that are formed/severed as the result of each characters action. The main characters need to re-examine who they are considering where they came from. For example, Blade's struggle against his true nature continues as Nyssa's faith in the vampire bloodline becomes questionable. The villain Nomak delivers one of the best lines to Blade as: Is the enemy of my enemy my friend, or my enemy?

Film highlights:

* If you have not seen the first film, watch this one instead; it gives you a nice re-cap of events and has a much stronger, tighter pacing.

* Blade 2 is to Blade 1 what Aliens was to Alien. It starts off with a bang right away, and it does not let up. Let us just hope that Blade 3 does not turn out like Alien 3.

* Ron Perlman is great as always; insanely perfect choice for casting him as Hellboy by the way. If you have not already seen ""Chronos"", also starring Ron Perlman, check it out. It's Guillermo del Toro's other ""vampire"" film. Keep in mind that Chronos is much more ""soulful"" than ""action-packed"".

* Wesley Snipes kicks so much ass, it's a good thing the boots he is wearing are steel-toed.

* If you liked Batman & Robin, you probably won't like this movie.

* If you liked Batman & Robin and you feel you can compare that movie to Blade 2, you may have had a lobotomy.

* Obligatory ""bad dudes walking down the street (headed towards a big fight) in slow-motion"" scene is great!!!

I got it as a gift for my 20th birthday and watched it two weeks later and man, the action is so cool and it's better than it's predacessor Blade I in a landslide. Wesley was his usual bad ass self beating the hell outta vampires. But Wesley is not my favorite character here. He's a close second. The first Marta, who is played by Leonor Varela is. She plays Nyssa, Blade's love interest, and man does she look hot in all that leather. She is one of the few Bloodpack members that actually respects Blade. For the exception of her and the guy with cornrows, I didn't like the rest of The Bloodpack and Norman Reedus with a complete waste. But the movie is so good because of Blade, Nyssa, and Whistler.

It's violence and gore to the max, probably enough to fill several movies, but it fits the movie. It's about vampires, so what can you expect? Blood, of course. And the new vampire elites have this special mouth opening trick that can be really disgusting to some people. However I thought it was awesome. There isn't really much plot to speak of. Blade's former enemies need him to lead their ""Blood Pack"" to battle the new vampire elites that have began an uprising. The movie mostly focuses on action, and it does amazing things with it. CG effects are weaved into some of the sequences, and it only makes them look cooler than they already are. I specifically liked the CG effects in the finale of the movie. As for acting, Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, along with Kris Kristofferson as Whistler. Newcomers are Ron Perlman as Reinhardt, and Leonor Varela as Nyssa.

1439577,4,B00005JKWI,"""Blade II"" is unique.  Consider first that it is based on an underappreciated and, up until the first movie, relatively unknown superhero outside of comic book stores.  Then consider that it's a sequel.  These are two things that just don't add up to success in the modern world.  You can make a clunker of a movie like ""Hulk"" and still get big numbers in the opening week based on the character's name alone.  You can also toss together a sequel(any of the ""Batman"" sequels)and gain solid numbers until word gets out that the movie is horrible.  Somehow ""Blade II"" takes both of these seemingly impossible odds, puts them together with a good plotline, slick action and solid direction, and comes up with a good movie that's ten times better than any other action sequel out there(excepting ""X-2"").
Snipes is perfect as ""Blade.""  He pulls it off with style, humor, and attitude.  Every move he makes is done in a ""superhero pose"" type of way.  He makes ""Blade"" both believable and impossible at the same time.  He's just flat out cool.  I know very little about this character except what I learned in the first movie.  I don't know if they got everything correct about the character, but I don't care because Snipes owns this character in the films.  Let the geeks iron out the inaccuracies.
""Whistler,"" played by Kris Kristofferson, is his same old tough-as-nails, cranky self.  The ""Nomak"" character, by Luke Goss, is a perfect foil.  You almost feel sad for the guy since his pop screwed with his genetics like that.  His fight with ""Blade"" is one of the best brawls in modern comic-to-screen history.  It's over-the-top, a little fake-looking at times, but fits the tone of this movie to a tee.  The rest of the cast is superb as well, especially Ron Perlman, the perfectly annoying Scott Reedus and Danny John-Jules(of ""Red Dwarf"").
Don't let the naysayers fool you, this movie has a solid storyline to it. It may not be the romanticized version of a vampire most folks are used to these days, but it does give you a taste of the gory side of our bloodsucking brethren.  If the plot isn't your cup of tea, don't worry, because this movie has also got gene manipulation, ninja-vampires, the token nightclub brawl, cool gadgets that would make ""Batman"" giddy as a schoolgirl and even a love interest, albeit a brief one.
Director Guillermo Del Toro manages to make the ""Blade"" franchise his own with this sequel.  He keeps the dark, techno-music tone of the first flick intact, but puts his own mark on this flick as well via gore and stylized action.  Folks knock the sometimes-obvious CGI effects and ""Wrestlemania"" type fight sequences found throughout this movie, but that's what makes this movie so fun.  It's not too serious, it's fun and it's so stylish that you'll want to forgive the CGI miscues and over-the-top fight scenes.  This is an action movie folks, not ""Pride and Prejudice!""
In closing, watch this slick flick for the fun, action-packed romp that it is.  ""Lestat"" he ain't, but ""Blade"" could take that punk out anytime, anywhere.",1081123200,4,3054,4.762357414448669

1439611,5,B00005JKWI,"""Blade ll"" offers exactly what you would expect:  Lots of martial arts fighting, thin plotting and ghoulish vampires, but the surprise is in director Guillermo Del Toro exhilirating and stylish approach, which elevate the film above its somewhat far-fetched plot, even for a vampire movie.  Wesley Snipes reprises his role as the titular vampire hunter, and with just as much aching cool as he did the first time around.  Within the first ten minutes of the film, he saves his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) from torture, and a new breed of vampire shows its face.  A Reaper.  A super-strong and almost indestructible foe that turns it vampire victims into new Reapers and this gang is led by a jolly good fellow Jared Nomak (Luke Goss).  Seeing Nomak as a threat, the Vampire Nation offers a truce to Blade for his help in hunting down and killing the super-vamps.  But of course, nothing for Blade is what it seems, especially with David S. Goyer's occasionally juvenile script.
But Snipes (who also co-produced the film) and Del Toro shine in this kind of movie.  Intense fight scenes comprise nearly half the film, involving swords, guns, bombs and plenty of fist-flying, giving fans of the first film what they really want:  Blade kicking much Vampire ass.  But the fights are sometimes marred by painfully obvious computer effects, and a couple painfully trashy shots.  But these are minor quips, seeing as Snipes is so freakin' cool as the big bad Daywalker, and Del Toro stages the battles with intense, macabre applomb.  If your in the mood for escapist fare with plenty of bloody violence, ""Blade ll"" fits the bill nicely.  The DVD includes a making of, details on the Vampire make-up and interviews with Del Toro, Snipes and David S. Goyer.",1076889600,4,1757,4.875420875420875
1439612,4,B00005JKWI,"The drawing of comparisons between this film and its predecessor is almost inevitable, and probably a mistake, but we'll go there anyway.  Blade II is bloodier than Blade; Blade II has more action than Blade; Blade II has better composition and effects than Blade; Blade II has a more complex storyline than Blade, yet I still am somewhat partial to the original.
Under the directorial guidance of Guillermo del Toro, we get to see a lot more action and a lot more blood spilled, particularly by the ""super vampires"" that Blade and the rest of the vampire crew join forces to hunt down.  Although one can almost place bets on the order in which the vampires accompanying Blade will die at the hands of the super vampires, the film still is suspenseful and holds back a few plot twists.
The two things I noticed most were del Toro's penchant for over-contrived CG action shots, some of which looked a bit cartoonish, and the completely different feel del Toro evoked.  Where Norrington relied heavily on a more monochromatic gray-black feel with touches of green and blue, del Toro plays more in the red-orange visual spectrum.  This, plus the Prague setting, gives Blade II a very different feel than Blade.
I didn't find a great deal of interesting material in the second disc, but the director's commentary is interesting (and amusing) enough to listen to if you can get through del Toro's thick accent.  Particularly funny is his description of an edit that was made to a scene after women's groups complained.  Also of interest is that the scene in question (which occurs in a private room at an adult store) is reminiscent of another David Goyer-scripted scene from Crow: City of Angels.
From his commentary, you can tell that del Toro had some dark, messy fun making this film, and that is evident in the splatter-fest that ensues.  Did I mention that del Toro is also less subtle with the gore than Norrington?  Bottom line: equal parts monster and action flick, Blade II delivers in either genre.",1076630400,4,2004,4.771676300578035
1439613,4,B00005JKWI,"Wesley Snipes returns in this really gross and really exciting sequel to the original hit.
Blade (Wesley Snipes) is still out killing vampires, this time armed with better special effects. He is tracking down his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson, the most grizzled man on the planet), who was taken by the vampires and held hostage. In the meantime, Blade has picked up a new weapons master, Scud (Norman Reedus, who looks a lot like Henry Thomas). Whistler is rescued, and he and Scud immediately do not get along.
The vampires Blade is always trying to kill want a truce. It seems there is a new race of vampires, called Reapers, led by the very ugly Nomak (Luke Goss). The Reapers are killing ordinary vampires, and once that supply is gone, they will turn to humanity for their prey. Blade is saddled with a group of mercenaries called the Blood Pact, who were originally trained to kill him. It features angry Reinhardt (the always excellent Ron Perlman) and the sexy Nyssa (Leonor Varela), daughter of the vampire leader Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann).
The plot really becomes secondary as Blade and the group infiltrate an underground hangout for vampires, and do bloody battle with the Reapers. This leads to a very long battle in the sewers where the Reapers congregate, and finally to the vampire headquarters, where double crosses and switched allegiances are ultimately uncovered.
This sequel can be described in one word: gross. I have not seen this much bodily fluid on display since my lactose intolerant toddler feasted on an ice cream cone. I am not talking a lot of fake blood, I am talking a lot of fake everything shown in graphic detail. The film is wall to wall violent, an almost two hour action sequence broken up into three or four main components.
Do you know what? The whole thing works. The special effects are strong, save for a couple of obvious computer animated fight sequences. The gore is excellent, from the Reapers' frightening mouths to the gallons of gore to the grossest autopsy of the last ten years. The film makers wisely just do not remake the first film, they expand on it. All the actors are good, making an impression despite the plethora of eye candy going on around them. Even the actors who are completely unrecognizable under the makeup (Goss, Kretschmann) still score some good scenes.
Del Toro is the perfect director for the sequel, he shoots it like he has been practicing for this for years. The film certainly never bores, moving faster than anything George Lucas has been able to come up with since ""Return of the Jedi.""
The couple of weak computer effects hurt. So does yet another villain who confesses everything before being killed in a very creative way. I won't give away any of the double crosses, but you do see them coming from a mile away.
All in all, ""Blade II"" is really neat. The action is nonstop, a forced romance is merely hinted at, and Snipes can kick bootay with the best of them. If a third movie is in the making, I'm ready. This is the film that give sequels a good name.",1074643200,5,3054,4.710280373831775
1439614,2,B00005JKWI,"One more reason why sequels so seldom work. Kris Kristopherson should have stayed dead. This movie is more like ""A tribute to Wesley Snipes"".

The only thing going for this movie is action, probably to cover the pitiful dialogue. If you are looking for a bloodbath, you found it and that's about all.

Honestly, the guy's so one-dimensional - he basically plays the exact same character in Blade II that he did in that awful Alien sequel he was in. Anyway, I digress...
The action in this film is pretty much non-stop, and gets going from the word go. And that's a good thing in my opinion. True, a couple of the CGI fight scenes are so obviously fake they're actually quite funny. Interesting cast memebers too - Danny John-Jules (Cat from Red Dwarf) plays Asad, and Luke Goss(!) plays Jared Nomak (Goss was in a pretty awful boy band with his twin brother in the late 1980's), but his performance here is quite good. Dont know why Whistler was brought back, as there was no real need to have him in this.

1439619,4,B00005JKWI,"BLADE II  is a far superior film from BLADE in just about every element: the acting, directing, writing, effects, music, lighting, sound, plot, believability are all better in this sequel than the original. I'm not sure why that is because at face value, it would seem that BLADE II is a totally unoriginal film, borrowing from the best of action-horror movies. However, the film works and works quite well.
BLADE II starts off not too long after the original movie ended. Two years have passed since Blade saved the world by ridding it of the young vampire who was threatening to destroy it.  Blade has spent that time killing vampires and searching out their lairs, seeking to find his weapons-manufacturer, mentor, and friend, Whistler. In BLADE, everyone assumed that Whistler was killed. However, we soon learn that wasn't quite the case. He tried to kill himself, but the vampires wouldn't let him. Instead, they turned him into one of their own and beat him as close to death as possible and then began the procedure all over. Blade succeeds in finding Whistler and injects a serum into him that will either turn him back into a human or kill him when the sun rises. The serum works and things seem back to normal.
However, things aren't quite normal. A new breed of vampire has risen that doesn't seek out human blood, but vampire blood. Also, unless a vampire is devoured, it turns into one of these new creatures, too. The creatures seem to be a cross between zombies and vampires, but stronger than either one. Silver and garlic have no effect upon them and only sunlight does any substantial damage. The vampire lord summons Blade seeking a truce. He wants Blade to help him hunt the creatures down. Blade agrees, only because it brings him farther into the vampire world than he has ever been before. And so, the chase begins.
The action was quite good in the film and though much of it is derivitive from the Matrix, those style of stunts work in the world where BLADE II takes place.  I was also impressed with how fleshed out the characters were. All of the major characters were fully developed in this movie and we see sides of Blade and Whistler that weren't even hinted at in the first film.
Overall, BLADE II is a fairly decent action picture that is far better than the original film in the series.",1070496000,8,2320,4.639902676399027
1439620,5,B00005JKWI,"You know there is a sort of good sence about a movie when they make a sequel. Most of the time you hear stuff like, ""This movie was good, but not as good as the original."" I'd like to clear up the stereotypes and tell you that this movie is good, and possibly better than the original.
Wesley Snipes is back, as one of the coolest heros ever. He fights these Vampires with silver weapons and practically decimates all. This time, we have friends and enemies pair up. Now alot of movies have this happen but can't pull it off because they grow emotionally attatched. The little love story is pretty good because Blade doesn't go all soft and crap. Then there is the other guys.... Brilliant. Especially that one dude who was in Alien Ressurection. He played a great villian in this movie.
Anyways, the action is better than the first. There are new breeds of vampires and the special effects team did an awesome job. Only 2 parts of 2 fight scenes looked to be done in all CGI(This one part where blade does a flip with a sword really fast and this other part where this guy trys to stomp him). Anyways, the movie does a great job of having Blade kill guys. And when Blade kills someone, you can honestly cheer because it will be awesome.
Also, the dialogue and character interaction is some of the best. We like seeing characters talk because it isn't all one-liners or all philosophy crap.
I hope people will see past the comic book and the original blade... This is an awesome movie.

I was dragged by a friend to go see it as Wesley Snipes just didn't interested me and i didn't really want to sit through 90 min of him. However, from the opening night club scene to the climax i was captuvated and thought that they would never top it.
Well they did...
The director of The Devils Backbone has brought a frentic, hyped up action adventure in the form of Blade 2. Where the first relied more on the vison, beginnings and drama of the Day Walker, Blade 2 pushes the story of half man, half vampire into overdrive.
This films shows that sequal can be successful in capturing the element of orginality from the first and then pushing it into a new realm.
Gulermo Del Toro created a film that moves at a speed and actually manges to successfully master the combination of action, suspense and horror.
The reapers are a truely effective villan and the sheer site of 100's of then crawling along sewers walls is sure suspenseful bliss.
This movie succeeds in creeping you out why giving you that 'WOW' factor.
From the opening scene at a European Vamp Blood Bank you will be hooked if you are into decent horror if not above average action horror film.
Wesley Snipes IS Blade and it shows in this film that he has made the charater his own through his ability to provide a convincing and more humours version of Blade, (as opposed to the first film where the charater was full of self-hatered and serious).
Visually the film looks very Europeon with Del Toro choosing yellows, blues, greens and reds to overglow the action on screen.
The storyline is solid and really excels in providing more of the mythology behind the vamps and extends it with the introduction of the reapers and the father of all Vamps. Infact getting more inside the hierachy of the Vamp side was a point of stroyline that i really liked, (where do i get a blood bath, yummy).
Overall, if you liked the first one, like horror, like vampires, and LOVE a good high adenalin action film - LOOK NO FURTHER.
Blade 2 recieves 5 stars for me because its delievers what it promised and is a good example of the more modern day action film and how sequals should be done.",1064620800,,2257,4.467312348668281

A lot more blood with some messed up new nemesis'(the effects for how they suck the blood is great, must taste yummy). Snipes is always cool is this part and I think it fits him and I think its his best role, being the daywalker. The action hits cool with some new vampire slayings and there's one dopey scene in which Blade and that chick fight by the highlights, I mean come on you can tell that's fake, but the other effects are way cooler. I just hated that Danny John Jules (Cat from Red dwarf) had to die in the sewers as a lot of those Reapers came up and killed him. A good time.

1439678,3,B00005JKWI,"Blade 2 is symptomatic of most sequels in that it is not as enjoyable as the first movie. The acting in the movie is still great and cannot be touched upon but all too often the film relies too much on flashbacks and the pace is a bit too slow for my liking. I know that sometimes a film needs to start slow sometimes and I could accept this in Blade 2 but it seems to take an age in getting out of the slow start and by the time it really begins to get in gear - it's too late and the film is almost over. Also the soundtrack isn't as powerful as the first one. It seems to be set for the goth market and it just doesn't have that same ""je ne sais quoi"" of the first one
I would like to reiterate that I didn't find the movie [garbage] in anyway. It is a good movie and is one of the better movies to come out of Hollywood in 2002 but it's just that there was not enough action in it and it felt a little stale.

Wesley Snipes is always good, but even he can't make up for the rest of this movie.

1439682,4,B00005JKWI,"As if to prove the old adage ""if it ain't broke don't fix it,"" ""Blade 2"" continues in essentially the exact same vein as its predecessor.  In other words, it's another combination of the old-fashioned vampire movie with the butt-kicking martial-arts extravaganza.  So if you liked the first one, you should have no problem getting into the sequel.  Of course, since ""Blade 2"" IS an action sequel, everything from the original has to get turned up a notch (or ten).  As a result, the fight scenes are more frenetic, the violence more graphic, the enemies more dangerous, and the special effects more extravagant.  The first ""Blade"" was very impressive visually, but this one makes it look like the original ""Dracula.""  That said, the unremittingly bleak look and feel of the original is very well preserved in the sequel.  Since the vampire-hunting plot of ""Blade"" wouldn't have been as impressive in a sequel, this movie finds Blade hunting an even more fearsome foe: genetically engineered SUPER vampires!  That's right, Blade (reunited with Whistler and teamed with an elite crew of ""regular"" vampires) now has to take on a gang of ""reapers"" who are even stronger and more bloodthirsty than regular vampires, not to mention immune to silver and garlic.  Pretty scary.  Naturally, the plot stops for a killer fight scene every ten minutes or so, and the choreography and cinematography are enough to rival that of ""The Matrix.""  It's all pretty far-fetched, but it does make for escapist entertainment at its finest.  And since ""Blade 2"" was gangbusters at the box office, hopefully they'll be getting a third installment out there soon.  Wesley Snipes has been all but typecast as an action hero by now anyway, so he might as well go with it.",1051228800,3,1744,4.911262798634812

1439717,4,B00005JKWI,"The original Blade was an engaging, character-driven action flick, only slightly memorable but a fun ride. Blade 2 brings back the engaging part but leaves out the characterization. Fortunately, it replaces the void with amazing effects/gore and outstanding choreography. This is a DVD review, however, so if you want a more specific plot review, go hit IMDB.
This film was made for DVD. The fight scenes, gore and ludicrous script all explode from the tube in glorious filtered color. There is a definite ""cool"" variable about Blade 2 that keeps one's attention on the action and away from the glaring plot holes, specifically:
- Sound editing. Director Guillermo Del Toro got himself a good man, or (more likely) oversaw himself the razor sound and audio effects cuts. The 2nd nightclub scene and the Bond-esque gadget scene brought a smile to me :)
- There are 2 commentaries, and I've only seen the one with Snipes and Del Toro, and it proved forgettable. Wes is as wooden in describing Blade as he is in acting him, 'nuff said. Del Toro just laughed along. There is another commentary with Del Toro and the producer, for those who can't get enough of them.
- Deleted scenes are included but unedited, re: videotape quality. They were deleted plot-wise with good reason (Snipes driving around for 3 minutes in his GTO, e.g.), so don't by any means hold this feature as a decision-making on buying the DVD.
- ""Pact in Blood"" documentaries: probably the best feature on the DVD, if you like ""behind the scenes/making of"" whatnot. Actually quite interesting how the clawjaw vampires were created, and the various superjumping and falling was done. Recommended if you go for this stuff. Adds about 30 very engaging minutes to your purchase/rent.
- Everything else is strictly taste-wise; the trailers, an art gallery and a music video are all here on a well-presented 2 disc set. The menus and interfaces are all very clean and easy to navigate, incidentley.
Overall, it's a safe purchase if you buy new for under [money amount], and enjoy action/horror. It's an excellent buy if you can get it used for under [money amount] as I did.<BR",1044576000,3,2137,4.857534246575343

Those two vampires take them to the ""Blood Pack"" which is an elite group of vampires that were trained to defeat Blade himself.  The vampires explain to Blade, that there is a new race called the ""Reapers"" that will turn the rest of the vampires into ""Reapers"" then do it to the humans.  Blade believes them and decides to work with them.

One of my favourite scenes is the intro or very beggining where blade chases after the vampires on the motor bike and then threatens to push the vampires face down into the motor bikes wheel while it was spinning. If you can't handle gore you propbably won't like this movie seeming there is alot of gore. i recomend this movie to people aged 11 to 30 though if you where 11 it would propbably be best you watch it with your friends or parents and especially do not watch it at night(it gave me nightmares).,1042761600,,765,4.2827586206896555
1439774,5,B00005JKWI,"I read somewhere that it was the X-Men that singlehandedly saved superhero films, and felt betrayed.
It was the original Blade (a dark horse if there ever was one) that proved the viability of the superhero film.  With it's tons of stylilzed action, blood, and Kung-Fu antics, it set the standard which other superhero films have been working to live up to.
Blade 2 is trendsetting in a similar (and check out the Director's commentary with Mr. del Toro and Peter Frankfurt.  These two guys are not only full of information, but they are hilarious!) manner.  The action is fast and furious, and the way computer graphics are used in some shots is remarkable.
Though, a pet peeve is that it doesn't make music an integral part of the proceedings like the original.  Instead it has a creepier, gothic vibe going for it for the most part.
And enough can't be said about the Reapers.  These guys are some of the creepiest characters to appear in film in a long time, and to see their gruesome faces are well worth the price of admission.
There are hints of a love story between Blade and the daughter of the leader of the Vampire Nation, but luckily there isn't too much time spend on developing this relationship because I personally thought that, considering the character of Blade, that the hints of a relationship between them seemed more logical that any actual relationship.",1042761600,,1376,4.716666666666667

Of course, Wesley Snipes plays Blade to perfection, he is the comic book hero of a new era. There are a few twists to keep you guessing and thinking a, little bit, thoughout the movie which with the brutal violense makes this movie great.",1042761600,,496,4.123711340206185
1439776,4,B00005JKWI,"If Guillermo del Toro set out to translate the language of comics to the silver screen, than he more than achieved his goal with the visually astounding Blade II. With the exception of the two returning characters of Whistler and Blade, this 'sequel' couldn't be more removed from the original if it tried. From atmosphere and colour coded lighting to whip crack pace and even more gore, Blade II is relentless in it's attempt to leave you gasping by the time the blood drenched credits roll. Foregoing any real semblance of plot (that would only slow things down after all), the film tends to feel like one long fight scene but it's all executed so impressively that the final impression left is one not unlike riding a rollercoaster. Not a bad thing and an even better thing if that's what the director set out to do. Guillermo himself is unapologetic in his honesty that he was simply intended to fashion a 'kick ...' movie that while different from Stephen Norrington's original, retains the similar style and wit that made the first so special. Acting wise, Blade is a role Wesley Snipes could probably play in his sleep so while he is predictably fantastic in bringing the character to believable life, all eyes settle on newcomer Luke Goss (he of Bros fame) and he doesn't dissapoint as the ruthless (and perhaps somewhat tragic) reaper Gerrad Nomak. From his appearance onscreen, Goss gives a captivating performance, somehow even investing a real humanity in a character that is more animalistic than human and that is testament to Goss' talents. Smartly avoiding overkill in the make up department, it's Goss' physical presence that is the most unsettling aspect of the villian. With two such formidable actors grounding the insanity that ensures in it's running run, the film is left to throw body parts up at the screen haphazardly. That it is crafted all so professionally allows you to simply be whisked away for the horrific ride. While not as acomplished as the first, Blade II remains startling good viewing. All action genres are pandered to, the horror fans get what they are after and when all is said and done, some might find themselves surprised how addictive the film continues to be, requesting if not demanding repeated viewings. A great horror and action film that deserves more of an accolade than simply 'sequel' and more a title in it's own right.",1042243200,2,2377,4.842751842751842

1439781,3,B00005JKWI,"I will try and keep this short. If you liked the introduction of Eric Blade in the first film then you will probably like this. I think it is a good film but by no means a better film than the first. On the plus side the DVD is loaded. It has got all you expect to see on a successful box office film DVD. What is very evident from watching the DVD is that they had more money to spend this time and I think that some of it was well spent. I am very impressed by the special effects (most of the time).  But the special effects were over used and one bit did really spoil it for me. When it comes pretty obvious that a scene is computer generated or is actually a stunt man it spoils it for me. However what really lets this film down is the weak story. Vampire films are pretty much predictable. We all know the main premise, we all know how to kill them and so on. The story could have been a lot better if the characters were developed more. The cast gave excellent performances with the material given to them.  But you can't help but feel that the characters could be developed even more.
A major downer for me however, was the commentary on the DVD's. All I will say is that some of the language used was frankly vulgar and rude. It did not strike me as having the professional touch. Even though it was not as good as its predecessor, it definitely is worth a watching and (having for us Blade fans). Wesley Snipes is perfect as the dark avenger.

1439815,3,B00005JKWI,"Do you remember the vampire movies pre 1990?  These vampires preferred to go solo.  Usually, someone was foolish enough to open a long-sealed crypt and let loose the undead, usually Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee.  The released vampire would generally spread havoc until he was staked through the heart.  He did not have to worry about competition from other vampires. Doctor Van Helsing would keep him busy until the climax.  But times have changed and so has Hollywood's vision of the undead. No longer is the vampire the well-dressed stalker who strikes at night.  Now, Hollywood has given the MTV generation a cooler and hipper set of vampires.  Director Guillermo Del Toro in BLADE 2 continues his own tradition as presenting not one but hundreds of vampires dancing in discos and acting like the spike-headed punkheads that Hollywood seems sure represent the bulk of the paying audience.  Wesley Snipes is Blade, a half-human martial-arts vampire who is immune to the sun and to garlic.  In the first BLADE, he rips apart legions of vampires, who promptly dub him Daywalker, since he fears not the sun.  In BLADE 2, Snipes reprises his role that permits him to engage in non-stop action from the opening to the closing credits.  When he reaches a moment that in another film another lead might pause for reflection, Snipes wastes not one moment in idle thought.  He uses his considerable physical presence to dominate each scene with breathtaking special effects that the audience has since come to expect.  And therein lies the problem with this movie and others of its ilk.  Believability and cause and effect were deliberately excluded from the script.  The world of BLADE 2 seems peopled exclusively by vampires of various sorts.  The garden variety vampires look, act, and speak like the middle class wannabe punkheads that they truly are.  If the script did not inform us they were vampires, I might never have guessed.  The only surprising variation was the introduction of a new breed of uber-vampires, who look more like the classical vampires of the past. These uber-vampires feed exclusively on the 'normal' vampires and are immune to the garlic and silver weaponry that used to work in the American International pictures.  These new vampires generally lope after their undead victims as if they were more chimpanzees than vampires.  Snipes battles both types of vampire before he agrees to focus his efforts only on this new breed.  There is absolutely no logic to his actions.  Both breeds of vampires are set up as straw men, only to be knocked down, while all the while the audience is oohing and ahhing over each more spectacular battle.  Kris Kristofferson is wasted as Whistler, Snipes' buddy, as only one of two humans in the movie.  The other human is a sleazy lawyer who allies himself to the undead in a way that critiques the often heartless profession of attorneying.  The plot bounces from one pyrotechnic display of blood and martial arts to the next with nary a thoughtful moment in between.  By the movie's end, I had long since ceased to care which breed of vampire would reign supreme over a world that seemed to lack non-vampire residents. That both Blade movies have proved to be rousing financial successes has filled me with regret that the day of the solo vampire has passed away to be replaced by non-thinking types whom surely Bela Lugosi would not have called kin.",1038009600,2,3409,4.885217391304348

There's also plenty of behind-the-scenes looks at the movie that will keep you busy for about as long as the movie is.  Overall Blade II is fun, scary, and entertaining.",1037923200,,876,4.54140127388535
1439817,5,B00005JKWI,"There was never a thought in my head that a sequel to Blade could be just as fun, dark, witty, and great as the original. I was wrong. Blade returns in his justly commendable sequel with just as must action and more bite than the first. More bite is mucho thanks to the events that takes place in the film. Blade is forced to join teams with a group of highly trained vampires to rid of a new breed of vampire called Reapers. These reapers, woo, they were some ugly freaks. They not only feed on humans, but plan to rid the world of vampires too. In Blade 2, it's basically good vs. evil vs. evil vs. good. This whole agenda made for some great plot twists which I didn't see coming at all, and a few I did, but they still were effective. The action is up a notch from the original, and it's all good. Most notable is the ""House of Pain."" Ouch.
 Wesley Snipes becomes Blade once again, and adds more depth to the character. Kris Kristoffersoon returns as Whistler. Yep, thought he died in the first one too, but his return is simply and quickly explained. The estrogen in the film comes from Leonor Varela as the daughter of a respected vampire leader. Great actress, and her last scene is quite poetic.
 Guillermo del Toro must have known exactly what he wanted, and he must have known what the fans wanted. He pulled all of the right punches, made a great cast of characters (It's all about Scud!), and gave the Blade storyline another level. Here's to a third . . .",1037577600,,1468,4.315217391304348
1439818,2,B00005JKWI,"I seem to recall a time, in the not too distant past, when vampire movies actually made a little effort to be scary.  This is no longer the case, apparently, for nowadays the vampires themselves have become so image-conscious that they just can't seem to be bothered with anything as mundane as conjuring up a few goose bumps for a thrill-starved audience.  These modern-day Draculas need to devote all their time and energy to proving just how hip, cool and trendy they really are.  Take the bloodsuckers in ""Blade II.""  In this sequel to the highly successful 1998 original, the vampires all talk in the vernacular of streetwise thugs and sport the very latest in grunge attire (one would think that there would be at least a few old timers in their ranks who would rather don a Bela Lugosi-type tuxedo than a torn jeans and leather ensemble, but, apparently, in this day and age, vampirism has become strictly a young person's game).
In this film, Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, the laconic ""half-vampire"" who, unlike his full-blooded brethren, can move around in the daylight.  Blade has dedicated his life to defending mankind against the deadly assaults from the world's apparently enormous vampire population.  However, in ""Blade II,"" a new twist has been added.  Blade learns that a new form of vampire - a ""super vampire,"" one that feeds on vampires as well as humans - has suddenly been unleashed onto the earth, and the mere conventional vampires are forced to enlist the aid of their own archenemy to help defeat this new strain.
Because ""Blade II"" ends up substituting action for suspense, the movie quickly turns into a monotonous series of nonstop chase scenes, gun battles and kickboxing sequences - all filmed so darkly that it is often hard to fully see what is happening on screen.  I guess we are paying the price for the success of ""The Matrix,"" since every action movie worth its salt now has to feature at least half a dozen martial arts sequences to make the action-hungry audience feel it is getting its money's worth.  The makers of ""Blade II"" also rely so heavily on gross-out effects and state-of-the-art gizmos and gadgets that they all but drain the life's blood out of the film.  With no one for us to identify with or care about, there is really no way for the story to generate any actual suspense.  We sit and watch, admiring of the technical aspects of the film, perhaps, but completely unabsorbed in the action on screen.  In ""Blade II,"" the vampires, super-vampires and pseudo-vampires, by waging what is little more than a two-hour long gun battle, end up boring us long before the sun peeks over the horizon.",1037491200,11,2648,4.75764192139738
1439819,2,B00005JKWI,"I loved Blade and was very much anticipating the release of Blade 2.  Unfortunately this movie didn't live up to my expectations.
I hate giving this a bad review but I found it completely implausible and had trouble getting lost in it like I did for it's predecessor.
I think the acting was severely downgraded, the story was weak and the action was the sole basis for this getting 2 stars.
Hard core fans will enjoy it, but I have a hard time believing some of these reviews saying it was better than the original.
I've even rented it to make sure that I wasn't in a bad mood that day- nope just another poor follow up sequel that they had hopes to launch into a franchise.  No word of Blade 3 because this one did so poorly.
Only die hard fans need apply, all others will be left wanting so much more.",1037232000,5,803,4.241830065359477
1439820,5,B00005JKWI,"It only happens once every, say, fifty, no, every hundred, movies when the sequel is better than the orignal. Blade II is one of these sequels to the highest degree.
Wesley Snipes returns in his all-star role as the Vampire-human hybrid killer of Vampires, Blade, every Vampire's worst nightmare. Over two years after his last big battle with his old enemy, Deacon Frost, Blade is still looking for his old time mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson). His search has led him out of America and into Prauge in the heart of the Czech Republic. He somehow gets hooked up with a pot-smoking loudmouth named Scud (Norman Reedus), the reason is a mystery to all. He rescues Whistler and cures him of the Vampire Virus, the pathogen responsible for turning ordinary human beings into undead parasitic monsters. Upon regaining his old friend, Blade's crusade to wipe the vampires out takes a rather unexpected turn. He is called forth by the very leader of the nation he has sworn to take out and worst enemy, Vampire Overlord Eli Damaskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), his darkly beautiful and warrior daughter, Nyssa (Leonor Varela), and her fellow side-warrior, Asad (Danny John Jules). Blade learns from them that Vampires have an even greater enemy than he is. This new threat are Reapers, a race of mutant super-vampires, who are even stronger, faster, and more viscious than ordinary Vampires. The Reapers feed on both humans and Vampires, and are multiplying rapidly, for they need fresh blood every few hours and will attack any human or Vampire they can to feed. Within a month's time, their numbers will rise into the thousands. Once they finish off the Vampires, the humans will be next. Now Blade is out to wipe the Reapers out and finally face the progenitor Reaper responsible for the very outbreak of the Reaper plague, Jared Nomak (Luke Goss). Along side Asad and Nyssa, Blade leads a team of Vampire warriors called the Blood Pack, Reinhardt (Ron Perlman), Chupa (Matt Schulze), Lighthammer (Daz Crawford), Verlaine (Marit Velle Kile), Snowman (Donnie Yen(, and Priest (Tony Curran), a team that was originally trained to hunt Blade himself. But that will not be easy, for the Reapers are immune to anything that will kill ordinary vampires, except for ultraviolet light.
This movie has great special effects. It is faithful to the legacy of creatures of the night in every way and places Snipes as a master actor! It shows that even the deadliest of predators have superiors, sooner or later. Seeing the Reapers, who are more like carnivorous, mindless zombies than humans or ordinary Vampires, at their handiwork of draining their victims of blood will leave even the bravest of vampire movie watchers on the edge of their seats! With lots of martial arts fighting scenes and brilliant swordsmanship, it leaves the hand-to-hand combat scenes of Blade I in the dust! Even Vampires have enemies that don't just hunt them, but eat them, now! The Reapers are a totally out-of-this-world new step into Vampire terror. They're basically what the movie is all about. I frankly think that the Reaper is one of the best movie monsters ever made. They're so original and scary. They are unlike humans or vampires, they don't offer their victims life, or resist any emotion that some Vampires may have, or offer any gifts of new ways of living, or act normal in any way at all.  They, as the director puts it, ""want to suck ya dry."" Some of the most intense sequences in the movie is seeing the Reapers open their mouths into foot-wide yapping maws, where their jaws split into twin mandibals equipped with fangs injecting lethal paralyzing venom, and out comes a barbed, snake-like tougne equipped with a gaping tendril-filled orifice that they use to siphon the life blood from their victims. And just wait till you see them in sunlight. See them burn black, the fierce blue light shine out of the the cracks in thier charred flesh in all directions, and finally explode in a shower of ash. As before, there are a lot of cool weapons and gadgets in the movie. And somewhere along the line, there's betrayl and revenge. But if you want to see where that comes in, see the moive and find out for yourself.
Finally, there's the actors themselves. Snipes is great at playing his role as Blade. Maybe it's the role he's best at. The one female character in the cast, Nyssa, is just what was needed for Blade II. She's pretty, she's a fierce fighter and she has feelings that show that she has some humanity even though she's a pure-blood. The relationship between Blade and Nyssa that develops through the movie, is one of the new ingredients to this sequal that makes it better than its progresser. Luke Goss has what I think is the second most important role in the movie. If you see him without his Reaper makeup on, you might think it ironic that he plays the scary, malicous super Vampire because he looks totally different, handsome in fact. But he plays his role as Nomak wonderfully.
But, one the best things on the movie is the final showdown. In Blade I, even though Frost was infused with La Magra, Blade had no real trouble putting putting him down. In the final battle of this one, Blade is totally out-matched by his opponent. If you've seen Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes, you may be reminded of the battle scenes in that movie where muscular men are thrown around like toys. This final battle is truly well-down.
And Snipes really does follow the qoute he makes in the movie. ""Keep your friends close, and keep your enemies even closer.""",1036886400,2,5545,4.782064650677789
1439821,4,B00005JKWI,"This film was something else. The producers had clearly thought long and hard about the cultural resonances of the vampire myth, and as a result there were lots of deep red curtains and carpets, tasteful blood-red works of art hanging in the background, and assorted vampires talking to each other in a variety of middle-European languages. The special effects were fantastic, with the new 'Reaper' vampires opening huge, tendril-filled mouths for our edification. I thought that the film was a valid contribution to the legend, although I could have done without the swearing, especially as we watched the DVD as a family, with Grandma keeping up a running commentary!",1036800000,2,669,5.146788990825688
1439822,5,B00005JKWI,"The horror action genre seems to invite mediocre sequels.  Film producers seem driven to repeat as much of the original film as possible, and most story lines are never all that rich in the first place.  So I picked up 'Blade II' as lark, not even positive that I would want to review it.  What I never expected was a sequel so good that it made 'Blade' look like it was just practice.
When the film opens, you discover that Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) never really shot himself in 'Blade'.  Instead, he was captured by vampires and has been used as a mobile blood bottle for the past few years.  Our first sight of Blade (Wesley Snipes) is Whistler's rescue.  Leaving a trail of dusted vampires, Blade takes his old mentor back home and administers vampire anti-venom.  There we meet Blade's new partner, Scud (Norman Reedus), who alternates between getting stoned and keeping Blade's supply of technological tricks working.
What follows is a spectacular attack by a pair of vampire ninjas who bear a message from Damskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), an ancient master vampire.  Vampirish reapers are eating the bloodsuckers of Prague as a snack before starting on the humans, and Damaskinos offers Blade the help of his vampire SWAT team, led by daughter, Nyssa (Leonor Varela), if Blade will consent to clean up the mess.  Blade, attracted by the idea of using vampires to kill even worse vampires, agrees.  And with that, the good times begin to roll.
The story, by David Goyer, is completely engaging.  It is full of noir imagery, with an almost Machiavellian plot, pitting modern technology with constant reminders of how ancient the vampire world really is.  In addition to the story itself, this film sports some of the most exotic fight choreography and digital imagery I have seen in this genre.  Director Guillermo Del Toro spares little to create a world of comic book intensity that draws heavily on anime for it's visual style.  The intent was to outdo the original production without imitating it in the least.  And that is exactly what he does.
If you have seen Blade, you already know that Wesley Snipes is perfect as the human vampire hybrid of few words and many moves.  And Kristofferson is equally perfect as the gritty sidekick.  Leonor Varela turns in a surprisingly good performance as the beautiful and deadly Nyssa.  And then there is Goss, and Kretschmann and Perlman and...  In fact, I could write several paragraphs of congratulatory praise for the entire cast, who were exceptional.  And then another for the music, the makeup, and the special effects.
If that is not enough, this two disk set contains enough 'making of...' and commentary material to make it a complete course in how to create a great horror action film.  Del Toro not only likes to talk about the hows and whys of this film, he does a very entertaining and thoughtful job of it.  Watching this was pure spooky fun and I heartily recommend it.",1036540800,9,2938,4.8107569721115535

The story was coherent, the characters had some depth, and some actual thought appeared to go into the script.  None of that is present in this movie.  It's like watching a John Woo travesty; one dumb action sequence after another, with little or no story in between.

1439855,2,B00005JKWI,"In Blade II, the Daywalker joins forces with those he hunts to stop a new evil that threatens both.  With a few added details, that's it, really.
I didn't really enjoy Blade II as much as I did its predecessor.  Partly this is because I have a hard time believing the cosmology of the Blade altiverse, which takes a lot of what is commonly accepted about the nature of vampires and throws it out the window.  Now, this wouldn't bother me if what replaced the common knowledge made sense, but it often doesn't, and what you're left with is a lot of internal discontinuity and illogic where it seems the filmmakers ignored their own rules or made up new ones to suit themselves whenever the old ones got in the way.
Another reason I didn't enjoy this flick as much was the style of the film-making itself. There was something odd about the lighting, particularly in the early parts of the movie, that made the film just plain hard to see.  It was dark and monochromatic in a way that my eyes and brain just couldn't deal with.  It actually reminded me very much of a low resolution video game, and was just as annoying.
The action and fight sequences were also treated poorly, with the camera leaping around so much that you just couldn't see enough of the martial arts to appreciate them, or even tell what was going on at times.  I prefer it when martial arts sequences are filmed from a still camera;  when the hero's doing an amazing crab kick I want to see it, not suddenly be looking down the villain's ear.  Here, too, the lighting did the action a disservice.  One early fight sequence that could have been quite interesting was filmed in front of a bank of floodlights so bright that the action was totally lost;  others were swallowed in shadow or overpowered by weird reflections.
On the other hand, there were several good things about this movie.  I always like Wesley Snipes, Ron Perlman was chilling as Blade's antagonist, and Kris Kristofferson was worth bringing back from the dead.  The costumes and makeup were pretty good (although the latter did have overtones of ""Buffy"") and the effects were well done.  The script, although a little predictable, was for the most part pretty good, presenting a story that made sense and held together well.  All these things went a long way to redeeming a movie that could have been a total dud, but still didn't make it as good as the original.

1439858,5,B00005JKWI,"I was going to say refreshingly new levels, as in the creative sense, but the word ""refreshing"" might not exactly work in this movie.  For this is a bloody, gory, sadistic piece of art that gets down and dirty from the starting gate, and never lets go.  It's really a terrific movie.
Why?  Two reasons.  First, the special effects.  I've written in other reviews how I can give or take them.  Sometimes they help, sometimes I find them annoying.  A good movie still depends on plot, and if it's all special effects, no matter how good, there will be always something missing from the movie.  In this movie, they are not only good, as in the fight scenes, which convey the speed and agility of super beings fighting each other.  But they are also essential to the plot, which is reason two.
We are used to vampires being the bad guys, and this also remains for this flick.  But the story takes a plot twist when Blade and his mortal vampire enemies find themselves uneasy allies.  Why?  Because an even more terrifying and powerful breed of monster has evolved.  This new breed is kind of like a vampire, but, and this is where it becomes art, has powers and physical abilities that make the ""regular"" vampires look wimpy.  Part of these physical abilities are very realistically shown via the special effects, and therefore essential to the plot.
I will not reveal what these new abilities are, but if you like you vampires gory, sadistic, and bloody, this one's for you.  And yes, there is even some good plot thrown in, as the previously mortal enemies are forced to work together.  There is also the return of Kris Kristofferson, who has been rescued from the vampires, but must be watched to see which side of the fence he's going to be playing on.
Overall, one of the best action sequels ever made.",1034899200,,1803,4.570093457943925
1439859,2,B00005JKWI,"The original Blade was a much better film.  Blade I's story was solid and the characters quite interesting.  I expected the sequel to be even better but unfortunately it relied too much on uninteresting special effects, the wrestling scenes were a joke, and gore.  The character Whistler had much more dialogue and actual ""Character"" in the first Blade film as did Blade himself.  The Vampires (The Blood Pack) in Blade II were in no way frightening or even semi believable.  Ron Perlman was good in City of lost children and Enemy at the gates and is obviously a better actor than portrayed in Blade II.  The first couple of minutes of the film was great with the ""blood bank"" scenes in the train station but it quickly went down hill with a thud.

1439861,3,B00005JKWI,"I really enjoyed the first ""Blade,"" and looked forward to the sequel, hoping for a mix of pretty aesthetics, good fight choreography, and mindless action. Well, it had ""mindless"" pretty well covered, but the rest was absent. Don't get me wrong - I love campy movies, brain bubblegum, and vampire movies in general; still, even with my deep love of film, I just couldn't get over how bad this movie was. Given the other reviewers' high ratings, perhaps my boyfriend and I missed something crucial here, but by and large, this movie is a groaner that doesn't quite attain what it seems to be reaching for (perhaps ""The Matrix"" meets ""From Dusk til Dawn.)
The director (who also directed the truly bad ""Mimic"") pretty much took ""Mimic"" and made it a vampire movie - it was kind of like ""Mimic"" meets ""Tekken"" meets [insert bad vampire movie here.] While many of the fights were well-choreographed, they just didn't know when to stop - there are fight sequences that last 3- to 4-times longer than their entertainment value, and it's more than obvious that the actors are on wires too many times. Unlike ""The Matrix"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the wire work just isn't well-done in this movie. Overall, the fights themselves aren't as carefully done, either, and attention to the finishing details was pretty much absent. If you like gratuitous, unending fight scenes, though, this may work well for you. Heck, I even like Kung-Fu movies, and I thought this was over-the-top.
The computer-generated images were not very good, and lacked many of the important finishing careful touches that really make modern CG so beautiful. The story as written was ludicrous and also overdone, although the concepts behind it could have been develped into something extraordinary. The acting ventured into the melodramatic, as did much of the direction.
The first half of the movie was amusing, but the second half was sheer torture. I am by no means squeamish or averse to violence in movies, but the gratuitous violence and gore went beyond ""shock value"" and into ""insane;"" at some point it just gets to be mind-numbing. The dialogue was laughable, and at one point, this line is actually spoken (I swear I am not making this up:)
""Where are we?""
""Some kind of chamber, deep within their lair.""
No really; ""deep within their *lair*!!"" Kris Kristofferson actually says that. Honestly. Couple that with the angst-ridden reaper running through gothic halls wailing ""FAAAATHERRRRR!"" in an out-of-place scene, and the overblown, romanticized, slow-motion death sequence of a main character, and you've got a recipe for ridiculousness. The entire audience was snickering for most of the last half of the show, and not in a good way.
The only bright spot in the film is Leonor Varela, who brings not only beauty, but real acting talent to bear. I hope she'll find a script with some substance to show us what she can really do. Luke Goss did a good job as the lead bad guy where the script actually let him, and I think he would also do well in a movie with a basic grasp of the elements of good storytelling.
Overall, I found it hugely disappointing. If I had gone in expecting sheer gratuitous campy BS, I might not have minded it, but the first film upped my expectations a bit. However, if you really enjoyed all of the aspects of ""Mimic"" (and not just that some of it was very pretty,) you may like ""Blade II."" Perhaps if there is a third ""Blade,"" they will look back to the original for inspiration, and figure out why the first one worked, and why this one does not.

The DVD itself is flawless. Quite possibly the best picture and sound available on DVD. The extras are good as well. The pact of blood doc. is very nice. There's an assortment of trailers and featurettes also on the disk.

1439904,5,B00005JKWI,"I absolutely loved ""Blade"". I am not familiar with the comic book character other than Blade is half human and half vampire. The special effects in that movie blew me away. I was a bit wary of the sequal but after seeing ""Blade II"", that movie was just as good as the first. I'm a huge vampire fanatic and the last vampire film (""Queen of the Damned"") turned out to be a real turkey. ""Blade II"" definitely didn't disappoint me. I found the idea of Blade working with his enemies to eradicate this new breed of super vampires compelling. I must admit I was rather grossed out by these super vampires and watching them feed. When Blade rescued his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristopherson), I wondered if Whistler was going to turn out like Blade; half-man, half-vampire since he was infected with the same vampire virus. Some of the humorous moments in the movie came from Ron Pearlman's vampire character . My favorite character in the movie  I have to say is the vampire named Lisa, played by Leonor Varela.  I liked how strong-willed her character was. What I really enjoyed was the twists that the storyline of the movie took. I really didn't expect for how the movie ended and for one of the major characters in the film. Obviously Wesley Snipes watched ""The Matrix"" very carefully because a lot of the fighting scenes in the movie were heavily influenced by ""The Matrix"". Now while ""Blade II"" is by no means Shakespeare, it definitely is one of the few modern vampire films that I thoroughly enjoyed without nitpicking the storyline apart.

It does get a one though cuz Leonor Varela was lookin' slammin' through the whole flick but damn that cheesy death scene at the end made me wanna cap myself.

Better than the first one, with some pretty gruesome and well-realized special effects, and an interesting plot (for an action-horror movie).

was going to be a sequel at least I, did. Well Wesely Snipps is
back as the daywalker in Blade 2. Last time we left him in Prauge
and we can see the change in Blade he has a sense of humor and
is much faster at showing his enemies no mercy yes Wesley Snipps
is amazing doing his martial arts scenes much more amazing then
Blade but then he had to pump up the volume. The story starts as
Blade is in a frantic search for Abraham Whistler who is played
by Chris Cristoferson when Blade finds him he decides to keep his old freind alive. But just as it seemed nothing would happen
after that Blade is attacked by mysterious foes that come to his hideout after a furious battle they let Blade know that they need
his help Blade suspicious of them takes precations and learns  ,
that undead vampireristic creatures called Reapers are feeding at will on the living and vampires , the Bloodpack as they call
themselves needs Blade to lead them into the darkness to battle
with the reapers.
  But Blade finds that some of the team does not like him but he gains a female love intrest from one of the members outnumberd
and closed in Blade fights furiously to stop the reapers but is
suddenly double crossed by a freind of Blades who seemingly gave
them Blade just to become one of them , Meanwhile a disagrement
between father and son for cursing him into the undead and the
son want's revenge...
  Blade 2 is bigger,better and faster then the original first
film Wesley Snipps is incredible in his action scenes Blade 2 is also in the highest format of Dts a 6.1 master of the film puts you into the heart of the film with incredible sound if you were
unimpressed by the first film this ones better if you liked the
first film you,ll get more in this one , if you have seen it in the theatre it has enough features to make it fun enough for those who have seen the film beings that it's two disks so what

Sometimes, Hollywood needs to relax on the laurel of the success of the first movie and leave it alone.  However, I am glad that they threw that advice out of the window with BLADE II.  My worry would be that the sequel would not be as action-oriented or smartly written as the first; the common thread found in many ""part two"" flicks.  What I got was more action than required and a storyline that involved a group of monsters called the Reapers, a vampiric bunch that destroyed humans and vampires alike.  The best part of the movie, outside of the fight scenes, was when Blade and the vampire task force had to join forces to destroy the Reapers.  How can a team work together when distrust almost becomes stronger than the common enemy?  That interesting aspect, along with the betrayal of a cast member and the mystery of the lost and found Whisperer, made this one of the hottest movies around!",1032739200,15,990,4.590909090909091

This movie had only one female character who, although not bad at all to look at, was totally unused for any sex appeal.

This sequel, by contrast, is dreary and belaboured, everything too calculated and cold... I'm sure they meant for it to be stylish and sexy, but it's all just dreadfully dull.  The film sets up the most hackneyed cliches (Blade the loner gets set up with a super team, a punkish/modern primitive vampire platoon, which he must lead to defeat their common foe...) but instead of following through on the premise, the filmmakers just let it drop to the floor, as flat as everything else in the movie.  No one bothers to embue the members of the group with any personality -- why bother?  they're going to die anyway.  In fact, they hardly get any dialogue at all, not even a wisecrack or cynical aside.  It's all just chop chop chop hack hack slice dice chop chop chop.  Hack.  Slice slice slice.  Bang bang bang.  Boom. Chop. Slice. Pow. Chop.  Bang bang bang.

If you came to see Blades' car, you will be disappointed, as it holds all of 8 seconds of the movies frames. Sound was well mastered and the CGI animation impressive, however, this is not a soundtrack worthy of the same recognition of `Blade I' fame.

1439947,3,B00005JKWI,"It's nice to see all these movie fans gushing about how great they think Blade II is, but as a mature male I must admit to a certain disappoinment at the complete lack of sexual tension between vampire hunter Blade and the leather-clad vampire babe played by Leonor Varela. One of the things that made the original Blade so entertaining was the interaction between Snipes and N'Bushe Wright. Compared to Wright, Varela's character is cold and dead. And it's not that Varela doesn't know how to be sexy. Critics raved about her steamy performance in Cleopatra. Director Guillermo Del Toro basically dropped the ball. I mean, if you are going to dress a dark-haired beauty in full-length black leather, the least you can do is to make the outfit snug. Even teenage movie fans know that sex has been an essential element of vampire culture since the very beginning. It's absence leaves a gaping hole that Del Toro tries to fill with buckets of vampire guts, but it doesn't work. When Varela's character dies at the end, I didn't feel pity or regret, because she never really came alive as a character. To sum up, let's just say that while Blade II may be a good action flick, it's not a good vampire flick.

Blade 2 was like watching a live-action comic book. Not only that, but it had a real story, and the ending was unexpected. My only complaint was the occasional profanity, which never belongs in a comic book (darned if I'd let my kid watch a movie with cussin'.) But the special effects were great, right up there with the new Spiderman movie. In one scene a super vampire tears himself from a spike, and as he crawls up the wall you can see his intestines, and it looks believable.

1439951,5,B00005JKWI,"The original Blade was regarded as the beginning of the resurgance of comic book movies, and its sequel tops it in every way possible. I just saw this last night and my head is still spinning. Vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes looking totally badass) returns two years after the original movie in search of his reincarnated mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), and after he finds him he is made an offer. A new breed of vampires called the Reapers are taking out normal vampires, and the vampire lord offers Blade a temporary truce so he can hunt them with his new associates the Blood Pack which is led by Reinhardt (Ron Perlman). The movie is slow in the first hour and a half, but the pace quickly builds up when secrets are revealed and Blade learns all is not what it seems, and what results are the best action scenes in a movie I've seen since The Matrix, excellent special effects (although some of the CGI could have been more polished), and the bloodiest goriest martial arts melee you'll ever see in a movie adapted from a comic book. My only complaint is that we didn't get to see martial arts great Donnie Yen (a member of the Blood Pack) for very long, it would have been great to see him and Snipes go at it in a fight scene.  All in all, Blade 2 is one of the few cases where a sequel outshines the original film, and this Platinum Series DVD is packed with extras: commentaries by director Guillermo Del Toro and Snipes himself among others, trailers, a strategy survival guide for the upcoming PS2 and XBox Blade 2 video game, and a Cypress Hill with Roni Size music video.

Fortunately, Blade II seemed to capture most of the best aspects of the original. About the only thing that lacked in this movie was a meaningful plot. At the end of the film, several questions buzzed in my head, as the characters and screenplay included some inconsistencies that simply were never adequately explained. The biggest one being... Whistler was supposed to have killed himself in the original movie (they even replay the scene where he supposedly shoots himself), yet he is alive and well in the sequel. Go figure.
Despite the various problems with the plot, the movie was very entertaining, and Blade fans will not be disappointed. As usual, Wesley Snipes IS Blade, and several other actors put in good performances as well. The soundtrack is o.k., but it was nothing comparable to The Matrix, or something like that. The visuals and special effects were fantastic, without being so overdone as to ""look fake"".

The style, fast paced action from the first is even bigger and better this time around. With improved special effects, awesome camera work and a very cool new breed of vampire, this film delivers the goods.
Blade returns, on a mission to save his mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), who, we find out, didn't die in the original film. But once he revives his mentor, vampire elite come to enlist Blades help against a new breed of vampire, one which feeds on vampires.
The stylized action is phenomenal this time around, which the camera swooping close in, far away, and all about the action. It is quite the visual feast.
Sure, there isn't much deep meaning in the film, but it doesn't matter. This is an action film that is chock full of action. Not just a retread of the same scenes countless other action flicks have. This creates a whole new world of action, and is pure enjoyment.

Of course every movie has it's problems. I found that story wise, it could have been a bit better. But then again it's only an entertaining horror/action flick. One major problem was the computer generated fight that took place in front of that display of lights. That was just plain ridiculous.

As Blade (Wesley Snipes), the half-human, half-vampire slayer recovers his presumed-dead mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), he runs afoul of vampires bringing surprising news.  A new kind of vampire (known as Reapers) have appeared on the scene, and basically are killing ANYTHING to control their thirst.  With a pack of vampires (trained to kill Blade), Blade and crew try to contain the spread of the Reapers, but may be betrayed by forces within this teneuous alliance.  Directed by Guillermo Del Toro (""Cronos"", ""Mimic""), and boasting some shocking visual effects (such as the Reapers method of draining blood), this is definitely a good ride for ""Blade"" fans.  The DVD includes some funny commentary tracks with director Del Toro and Wesley Snipes, a detailed ""making-of"" documentary, a humorous batch of deleted scenes, documentaries on the visual effects, and a lot more.

1440010,4,B00005JKWI,"Blade was a cult classic berthed from a comic book of the same name. To those who know the back story, I apologize, but some are unfamiliar with the franchise. Blade, real name Eric, was in the womb of his mother when she was bitten by a vampire, Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff). When she died he was taken from his mother's body with a semi-metamorphism into what she was to become, a vampire. Blade inherited all of their strengths included increased strength and regeneration and brushed off all of their weaknesses (silver, sunlight, and garlic). He is the most powerful weapon against vampires, but something else is on the streets, something worth than him to the vampire nation and they need Blade to lead their elite task force to eliminate this new threat before it destroys the world.
This is where the Reapers come into play. The Reapers are a new strain of vampire that feed on both vamps and humans, but are more like locust and need to feed every couple of hours to survive, when they do they spread their ""disease"" and more Reapers are born and with every one their numbers can increase ten-fold.
The surprising thing about Blade was that it is inherently better than the original because of an obviously bigger budget and better backing by New Line. The movie is beautifully directed and produced so that anyone who is new to the series, and those fans of the comic book will be equally impressed. While the movie features far too much CGI work than one would like the non-stop action keeps things interesting and flowing over its two hour running time. Some of the plot points are very predictable, others aren't so much, but it is enough to keep you entertained.
New Line's Platinum Series of DVDs have set the bar time and time again in both the video and sound categories. ...Grain has been kept to a minimum and the initial master print looks to be very clean allowing for a good digital transfer. The dark tone of the movies colors come out just as they should, blacks are deep and clean.
Sound is awesome and puts your surround system to good use. New Line was so nice as to include the standard Dolby Digital 5.1 EX track as well as a DTS 6.1 ES track that really opens up the rear channels. Positional audio is just as you would expect with the front speakers taking care of most of the work, and the center channel handling the audio. The LFE channel is widely used especially during gun battles and explosions. Both the DD and DTS tracks are very rich and clear without the slightest bit of ""tin-can"" sounding dialog and distorted sound effects.
The Special Features are excellent on this disc. You get a second disc featuring an interactive documentary about the movie, a director's notebook, art gallery, theatrical trailers, and a survival guide for the Blade 2 video game. You are also treated to two commentary tracks from the director, producer, writer, and star so you get a good overview of the different aspects of the production. A bonus on the first disc is the 5.1 Surround Sound isolated score, which is a hard find on DVDs today. A very solid entry into the Platinum Collection.
This two-disc set is a must own for any fan of the comic book series or of just the first movie. The story is very well thought out and manages to fit into the mythology of the franchise perfectly. While there is a bit too much CGI work in the film itself you would be hard pressed to find a more solid disc. With this release it becomes more evident every day that New Line cares about home entertainment and the Platinum Series is the thing to beat in the DVD realm.",1031616000,,3585,4.542503863987635

balde 2 is one of the best action/horror flicks this year (2002) you want gore, you want swordfights, fistfights, bloodsuckers, really, really loud rockin' music...this movie is for you.
As for the acting, I'm becoming convinced that Wesley Snipes IS Blade. I can easily see there being a couple more sequels in the series, and just as Sean Connery will forever be associated with James Bond and Harrison Ford with Indiana Jones, so will Snipes be with his creature of the night, Blade. He plays the part perfectly; it's one of those things you just sort of take for granted and don't really think about, but if you do happen to ponder who else would be able to play the role, I don't think you'd be able to think of anyone else. He puts more emotion into Blade in this movie than he did in the first one here he displays his hatred of the Bloodpack, his martial arts skills, and his romantic side In fact this is one of those movies where you really believe the cast are vampires

1440052,4,B00005JKWI,"Wesley Snipes OWNS the role of Blade.  Blade II is probably one of the best sequels to any film ever made.
Jaws II bit (in the wrong way).
Jurassic Park II was a bit light.
The Omen II was nonsensical.
Home Alone II was just a rehash of the first film.
Etc.  You get the picture....
Blade II picks up some time after the first film ended.  Blade is still doing the ""good"" work, killing vampires, but since his friend and mentor, Whistler, was killed in the first film, he's been working with a new kid, Scud.  Soon enough we are told, Blade learned that Whistler, though ""dead,"" was secreted away by the vampires and ""turned."" He lives a miserable life in a vat of blood, unable to function either as human or vampire.  Blade goes to rescue him in Eurpore (where this film begins and takes place).
Upon rescuing Whistler, Blade is faced with the realization that he must work with the Vampire Nation to attack a mutual foe:  the Reapers.  The Reapers are a new form of vampire - evolved, if you will - a form that cannot be killed by a stake through the heart, decapitation, garlic, holy water, etc. - with one exception - daylight......oh, yeah, and Reapers don't only hunger for humans, but vampires as well.
Faced with a foe that is almost impossible to kill, Blade agrees to join forces with the Vampire Nation to destroy the Reapers.  Neither one trusts the other, but they realize they must do what they must do.
The Reapers are a truly grisly sight and ""Blade II"" is a true gore fest.  But do not dismiss this film because of those facts.  The acting here is superior.  The actors are fine and seem to really enjoy their roles.  The script is good and the director did a fine job.  The special effects are - maybe a bit too good.  It is REALLY gory.
The first film set a tone in the way that the film was imagined (it had sort of a blueish hue to it and the reds were exceedingly vibrant against it).  Blade II smartly chose the same path, which really sets this franchise apart from any of its rivals.  The Blade films have their own look and feel.
Taken from the comic of the same name, Blade is possibly the best of the Marvel's titles to reach film.  Blade, the comic, was always dark and disturbing and the films have kept it so.
Spiderman is an awesome film, but needs to maintain its ""reality"" and keep it from becoming hokey as DC's film franchise of Batman did.  The X-Men was the benchmark film for Marvel's tentpost title and it, in retrospect, fell flat when compared to the Blade films and Spiderman.
So....definitely check out Blade II.  If you've not seen Blade I, don't worry too much, the story stands on its own - BUT, the first film is really great too - so I do recommend watching them in order.",1031529600,2,2722,4.354455445544555

1440055,3,B00005JKWI,"""Blade 2"" is an enjoyable formula-film, characterized from an almost unsuspicious romantic tinge.
In the second chapter of the series, the new vampires leader sends his attractive daughter to negotiate a temporary alliance with Wesley Snipes-Blade, half man-half vampire, immune to the light and silver, and pitiless exterminator (in ninja-samurai style) of vampires.
The final goal is to chase a common enemy: the deadly Nomak, a vampire-Frankestein, degenerated from an unlucky cloning experiment by the vampires leader himself, able to infect both men and vampires, transforming them in degenerate beings.
To help Blade in the audacious enterprise, it's ready a squad of presumed ultra-trained vampires, who are going to go up as smoke.
At the end, after an apocalyptic ""ridding of pests"", and literally incinerated all the characters of the script, Snipes and the faithful Kris Kristofferson (this one revived from the first ""Blade"") are the only survivors.
It turns out immediate to the reader as the final goal's surely achieved without need to add any particulars.
There is not even the risk, sometimes feared, that the new sequel could foresee too many points of contact with the actual chapter.
The general plant of the plot goes back to ""Aliens"" and to ""The dirty dozen,"" without neglect suggestions even from ""Popeye"" (the regenerating dive in the pool of blood remembers much the ""spinach-effect""; and after all also Blade is a character of the comic strips).
In the context of an approximate screenplay, that seems spoiled from repeated afterthoughts, it stands out the not verbal dialectic between Blade and Nyssa, the daughter of the Vampire Nation ""leader maximo"".
The tenebrous Nyssa is not able to win the dull distrust of the crusader Blade in useful time and, tricked even from the father, broken not from the fights but in the heart, she surrenders without resist to the infected bite of the degenerate stepbrother, choosing then to incinerate between the arms of Blade, in a dark romanticism that remembers ""Arch of Triumph"".
At the end it seems however to go in ash just the hero-Blade, incapable in distinguishing between nobility and poverty and between faith and fanaticism; the whole story at the same time coming to an unintentional parable on the destructive effects of the ideological absolutism.
It would have been interesting to go into the opposition between humans such biologically but ethically vampires (see the characters of Scud and Kounen) and vampires such biologically but ethically humans; but that required too much courage...
""Blade 2"" stays an enjoyable formula-film.",1031443200,3,2613,5.253588516746412
1440056,4,B00005JKWI,"Thanks in large part to director Guillermo del Toro, ""Blade 2"" is a whiz-bang sequel. [The original was directed by Stephen Norrington.] It may be just a testosterone-laden movie aimed squarely at young males, but at least it's finely crafted and not without a touch of style. As for substance, forget substance. It's based on a comic book and, if the characters all behave in a cartoonish way, perhaps that's on purpose.
As for the special effects, ""Blade 2"" has some creatures that are genuinely scary. When these mutant vampires take a bit out of you, they don't kid around.
The script is absurd and full of plot holes. Blade [Wesley Snipes], half man, half vampire, now faces a new enemy - a new kind of vampire that is unaffected by most of the conventional weapons used against such creatures, Even the purebred members of Vampire Nation enlists his aid because these monsters are out to get them, too. The script, though, is just a framework on which is built a series of dazzling, adrenaline-pumping fight sequences, all fought on fairly ingenious and properly creepy sets.
""Blade 2"" is strictly for the boys. It's a bad choice for a date movie. Frankly, it's not really my kind of movie. I'm more intrigued by character-driven fare. Still, it's only fair to admit that, for what it is, this is very good entry in the horror genre.",1031356800,,1339,4.702127659574468
1440057,2,B00005JKWI,"If your taste runs to the sophomoric ideation such as the WWF and that ilk, by all means, run to see the film. However, if you are seeking a storyline that isn't interrupted every few minutes with inane martial arts, puffed up chit chat, and an accompanying Rap soundtrack, avoid it.
The best bet with this is to rent it first. Personally it was a money waster for me and I regret buying it based on the original Blade without having seen this sequel first. It won't hold up well on repeated viewings the way the first one does.
When all is said and done, this film seeks to financially cash in on the Rap/Hip Hop culture and the many anime/martial arts fans while dressing it up in a pseudo-vampire theme.
Those associated with this film should be embarrassed to have lent their questionable talents to its creation.

1440058,5,B00005JKWI,"This is without a dought, the best action movie I have ever seen. Blade 2 starts off as Blade (Snipes) giving you a quick review about he became Blade. Very intersting. Then it has him running in a tunnel finding his mentor Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) in a tube in which the vampires have been torturing him. You don't see that. Then he brings him home. And he is talking to him and his pal Scudsy. Then as their talking the Bloodpack people come in soooo quietly that you can not hear their footstep at all. Now here comes the action. Blade is doing all this Martial arts action and is donig a GREAT job at it too! Then as he is going to kill the last person of the Bloodpack, he says we have a proposition for you. Blade listens. He says there is a SUPER VAMPIRE out on the lose. Blade is like "" So let me get this strait. "" You want me to kill this vampire for you""? And from there it is action, suspense and some tense moments. Much better then the first one. Blade 2 is rated ""R"" for Strong Persuasive violenve, language, some drug use and language. This movie has blood in it. That is a defenitly. But I think Blade 2 is better with all the blood. It makes it more exciting. It really dosent have any gore, but there are 2 parts that could make you a little grossed out. Both of them are a back reveiling a guys spine (not that bad) and a person opening up a super vampires chest. There aren't that bad, but they made me a little grossed out. But then I liked it. On my scale from 0-10 Blade 2 is a Pulse Pounding, Action Packed 10! Great movie. Have fun!",1031356800,,1563,4.127868852459017
1440059,4,B00005JKWI,"This is much superior that the original cult film. Wesley Snipes reprises his role once again as the half breed (half human, half immortal) bounty hunter, and this time he is about to join forces with his all-time sworn enemies (the vampires), to take on a perpetual new breed of vampires known as The Reapers. A truly dazzling experience in its superb imagery, premise and action sequence. In fact better than QUEEN OF THE DAMNED. One of the year's best!!!!!",1031270400,,459,4.75

1440089,4,B00005JKWI,"As like many people, I am always a bit skeptical about sequels.  I absolutely loved the first Blade, and was half expecting the sequel to disappoint me.  I was wrong.  The movie clicked along at a great pace.  Watch the deleted scenes and listen to the commentary.  These guys know how to make an action movie and keep it moving along.  However, the sequel was much more of an action movie - the first movie had more character development and, actually, I liked the vampires in the first movie better.  But the action and the visual effects in the second movie made for an excellent time!  The extensive use of computer generation was very fitting for a movie based off of a comic book.  I will gladly watch this movie again and again.  Simply awesome!!",1031270400,,753,4.511111111111111
1440090,3,B00005JKWI,"I saw the first Blade when it was released in theaters and enjoyed it. Though perhaps it would be more apt to say that I bought into it. Being a vampire aficionado of a sort, I was willing to accept the idea of Blade and found a chuckle or two in the idea of vampires being able to walk in sunlight after a good dose of sunscreen was applied. What supported the first installment of Blade so wonderfully was the atmosphere. (That and perhaps Stephen Dorff who pulled off the smug vampire villain quite well.) Blade II, however, was missing that key ingredient as well as a couple of others.
The whole of Blade II is based on exaggerated violence. That's about it. The story plants a series of ""mysteries"": who's the traitor inside the Blood Pack?, being the primary. Unfortunately, it's not all that difficult to figure it out and once that falls into place so does the rest of the plot. It really shouldn't have been that predictable. The basic idea, a new mutation of vampire bent on wiping out the original strain, is not necessarily a bad one, but the unexplored  psychological motivations behind their attack reduces it to mediocre at best. And, really, the task force, known as the Blood Pack, that is formed in order to hunt and destroy the Reapers must be the most ineffectual group of vampires I have ever seen. With the exception of possibly two members-- where's the speed, the grace, the unparalleled strength? They show no signs of heightened senses whereas Blade, half mortal that he is, knows all and sees all.  And as I've said, the atmosphere in this installment is lacking. It doesn't seem as charged and energized. It isn't as sophisticated as the original and it isn't conducive to the violence that is presented--with, again, perhaps one exception. But even then it harkens back to the original Blade with its strong sense of the night club scene and the abandonment that the vampires find in their immortality.
The action sequences, the ones involving Snipes and some really snazzy martial arts moves, were very good. The ones involving blood and turning vampires into ash and bone were pathetically overdone. It was a case of special effects overwhelming everything else. And the very amount of fake blood they used alone must have severely taxed the budget. They were going for gore, that much is obvious, but it seems much too foolish to be realistic.
Overall I thought that the original Blade was much better, much more interesting and fresh, but if you've seen the first one you should see the second one as well. There's enough action to keep one satisfied even if the storyline is lackluster.",1031184000,,2621,4.720524017467249
1440091,4,B00005JKWI,"I knew, right off, when I heard they were making a sequal to Blade, I had to see it. Anyone one who loved the original is in for a treat.
  Blade II is and action packed thriller, with great stunts and an AMAZING soundtrack! I believe, the special effects may even rival The Matrix!
  This movie starts off with Blade, shockingly, taking sides with a group of Vampires, to fight a group of super vamps! The mission proves to be harder than they imagined. It seems this new breed of vampires has no known weakness, and loves to partake in a little vampire blood as well as human! And boy are they ever scary, they make regular vampires look like bunny rabbits!
  The only reason I could not give Blade II five stars is because I found the story line a little lacking in comparison to the original. The special effects were great though and I highly recommend this flick!",1031184000,,869,4.4

Action, marcial arts, kicks, punchs and a lot of fun.
The plot...well the plot is lame, like all the secuels plot.
Example: Mein In Black 2(Horrible), Urban Leyends, final cut(Worst than Candyman 2) and(But not a secuel) The Scorpion King(What was that?).
Here our friend Blade, after he gets back his old partner Whistler, is asked by the vampire Damaskinos to be a like 7 vampire gruop boss to kill the reapers. Specially Nomak, the first one.
Blade II is not bad at all, but they could came with a better plot. Like I said, action is awesome. I was with my mouth opened all the movie, I couldn't belive what I was watching lokked so real!.
Wesley Snipes is not a good actor, but not bad at all.
The one I liked was Scud(Norman Reedus), he did a great job.
He was like, the funny guy of the movie(This movie have a lot of humor and sarcasm jokes).Scud is Blade's new partner.
Lyssa was pretty, and the other girl with red hair too. But unfourtunally I can't say that the two of them will survive.
Whistler is back men! He kicks buts here!, he's the best charachter of the movie, even better than Blade(Well, not Blade).
Director Guillermo Del Toro(Also directos of the cool monster movie with another bad secuel, Mimic) did an excellent job.
He knows his job.
Blade II is for horror/action movie lovers. Or, of course, the comic fans.
It's not better than the first one of course, but tis one has more action with the  2002 moder visual effects.
Go and see it now!

1440096,5,B00005JKWI,"It is rare to see a movie that can it top its predecessor in both technical production design and an overall acceleration of movement throughout a would-be-let-down sequel.  Blade 2 is one of those rare movies that just has ""something"" that the first one didn't have-HEART!  I feel when I watch the original Blade (which I've seen too many times to mention) it seems as though the director wanted to simply introduce an idea-""the world isn't what you think it is.""  Blade 2 has a strong (and complex) story, it's introduced it's important characters from the first one so it doesn't need to back track on things.  The exception is a few forced scenes I think they should've left out about Whisler and his history with Blade since most people already knew about that.  Aside from that, the reapers were simply a epic marvel of great prosthetics and slick CGI.  The action is faster, the gore is far more vivid and surreal and the overall look of the film is a showcase of constant improvements from the last film.  Quite simply, this DVD and film is OFF THE HOOK!  Can't wait for number 3!",1030147200,5,1088,4.572164948453608

Great action choregraphy better than Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon!!!And this is the first really,of all the vampire films I've seen, that how a vampire should die its like being eaten by fire coming from the inside the CGI really compliments the action. The story is ok although it could have been done with the character of kris kristofferson (no bad personal intention) differently say becoming a truly bad vampire...anyhow just a suggestion...

1440129,1,B00005JKWI,"Since I really enjoyed the first Blade, I was excited about the sequel. This film was a terrible disappointment. Instead of utilizing traditional filmmaking tools, such as actors, plot, and character development, director Guillermo del Toro throws in one lame action sequence after another. Don't think that this endless action is a good thing. Half the fighting is uninspired and full of pitiful CGI.  Where the final showdown in part 1 was a classic kenjutsu duel, in part 2 it is a stupid brawl, replete with ridiculous wrestling moves. I'm using the word stupid a lot because that is the word that this entire movie reeks of. It is as if the movie was designed to deliver cheap thrills that would only satisfy the stupid. I was insulted by this movie, as if the director was suggesting I was stupid and trying to take my money by tricking me into seeing this trash. It is obvious that  Guillermo del Toro was not affiliated with the first Blade, as there is an absence of complete stinkiness in that movie. The first movie was by no means perfect, and so I thought that this one would expand on the first and continue an entertaining and noble franchise. Sadly, this movie did not do so. This is the kind of sequel that makes you ashamed that you saw the first one at all. Pure filth.",1028678400,4,1288,4.547413793103448

This movie has retained all the qualities of the original and built on them to give us an action packed feast, and folks we are talking about serious action here, from beginning to end.  The martial arts scenes are on a par with The Matrix, simply stunning.  The special effects are beautifully flawless and the influence of the ""Alien"" movies is very evident. The costumes are just so coooool. But best of all, the storyline was an interesting development on the original and topped off an all round excellent sequel. Terrific.",1026950400,,741,4.548872180451128
1440136,3,B00005JKWI,"I walked out of the cinema as the closing credits for Blade II flashed behind me, my heart racing and a little highlight reel of the movie flashing through my head.  Right from the outset Wesley Snipes (star), David Goyer (writer) & Guillermo del Toro (director) have to the foot to the floor for this blood-soaked sequel.
Big thumbs up to Goyer and del Toro for keeping enough similarities between this movie and the original to keep the fan base but injecting enough new material to keep original and fresh.  The first thing you will notice is that this movie is a lot gorier than the previous installment.  Not having seen any of the director's previous efforts I don't know if this is common for him but I think it will catch a lot of fans from the first movie off guard.  Mostly it is B-Grade gore, reminiscent of say an Evil Dead movie, so horror buffs should be at home, but those who have came for a glimpse of Welsey's buff black body may be in for a shock.
Without giving too much away about the story, Blade has to ally himself with a gang of elite vampire warriors (led by Red Dwarf's Danny John Jules) to defeat a common enemy in the Reaper Nomak and his brood.  Basically Reapers are the next ""mutuation"" of the vampirism ""virus"" that prey indiscriminantly on both humans and vampires.
From here on the movie follows a pretty established ""bug hunt"" story through the sewers of err somewhere in Hungary.  The scenario is quite similar to Aliens but still well executed, well shot, moody and exciting.
Two hours of exhilarting action, blood, bullets and gore later the movie hits an actioned packed climax, which owes more than a little debt to Blade Runner, and the inevitable final showdown between Blade and his adversary.  The final fight scene is truly breathtaking and well executed as are all the fights in the movie.
Overall just like the first installment Blade II is great, lightweight, mindless fun.  Another great blend of superhere action and horror.  While the lack of a charming heart throb villian like Stephen Dorf's Deacon Frost has taken some of the sex appeal from the movie it is still great for any fans of action or horror movies or just super hero movies like Tim Burton's Batman or The Crow.",1026432000,,2228,4.591939546599496
