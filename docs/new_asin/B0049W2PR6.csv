8419481,4,B0049W2PR6,"I purchased this video for home use, not classroom use. I was pleased to find that it has all the usual elements of a Bill Nye the Science Guy video - the intro music, familiar kid scientists, lots of interesting facts pulled together, and a music video at the end. My kids (ages 2 and 10) both like this one, but it's not our first choice. The humor is a little bit muted, and the messages about environmentalism and conservation are very indirect. Still, this is a great addition to any Bill Nye collection.",1316304000,2,509,4.425531914893617
