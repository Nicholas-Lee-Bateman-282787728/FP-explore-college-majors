8467797,5,B005DZKEBW,"P2 was dull, but Trailer Park of Terror was worth every penny. It's like they just tried to cram as many elements of bad horror movies as possible into one bizarre, over-the-top, and endlessly entertaining flick",1358208000,,211,4.888888888888889
8467798,5,B005DZKEBW,"Great movie. I am a horror freak and this movie mixes horror with comedy so its really funny and strange at the same time, something I love!! I originally purchased this movie about 3 years ago and my fiance lost it and I found it on Amazon for a better price and the shipping was extremely fast! I Love Amazon and I love this movie too.",1349740800,,337,4.121212121212121
