8630352,5,B00164GZCG,"I'm a trained facilitator , I can say without a doubt, this program was a life changer for young adults & adults alike. While I delivered this class to a trapped audience , they all learned so much that they are not long term or hard core welfare clients to this day. All of them are mostly young women who have made lives for themselves & their children. But, most of all, while I did not have any choice but train to be a facilitator , life was changed in ways I would not have expected. It is truly a life changing program.",1498780800,,526,4.116504854368932
