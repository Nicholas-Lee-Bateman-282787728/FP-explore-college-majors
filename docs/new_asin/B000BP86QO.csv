2434565,4,B000BP86QO,"A few years back the Met did a series of Tchaikovsky operas produced by the Kirov. A fellow audience member discussing the operas suggested that it was a shame they would not be doing Maid of Orleans because it is this composer's most successful musical drama and his most gorgeous operatic music. Well you know how absolutely opinionated opera people can be. But I do agree that it's fabulous music. This DVD proves the opera should be produced in America more often. Visions, military combat, an evening of letting go with a clergyman, inquisition, immolation. What's not to like?",1212192000,9,582,4.888888888888889
2434566,5,B000BP86QO,"I enjoyed everything about this performance, especially the staging and the camera work. The cast ranged from very good to excellent, both in singing and acting, and the orchestra and conductor were superb.",1204761600,5,206,5.2727272727272725
2434567,5,B000BP86QO,"This is a wonderful opera, filled with music of really beautiful inspiration. I like, for example, the prayer in the first act, what a great tune!!!, followed by the famous aria sang by Joan (""Goodbye, forest""). The chorus at the beginning of the second act is another pearl. The last act is incredible, with one of the best duets for soprano and bariton written by Tchaikovsky. And the final scene is so powerfull and compelling: a somber and menacing march that grows into an impressive climax at the end. The operas written by Tchaikovksy are so different: from the intimacy of Onegin to the drama of Queen of Spades, from the sweet and lyric Yolante to the epic pathos of Mazeppa. If you love Tchaikovksy, you will adore this one!!

The staging is good, although I don't like it thorough. There are some cuts, the ballet, for instance. Anyway, is a good production.",1170633600,9,869,4.6797385620915035
2434568,5,B000BP86QO,"It is terrific to be able to see one of Tchaikovsky's neglected operas at last.  Tchaikovsky worked on 12 operas - only two of which are regularly performed:  Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades.  Of the 12, two were never finished; he destoyed two others (one of which has been reconstructed); and one appeared in two forms under two titles.  The Maid is a big opera - considered by some, his 'grand opera'.  Sort of his equivalent in scope to Puccini's 'Turandot'.  We have enjoyed this music for years on long-deleted LPs and are very happy to have access to such a well performed and fine production of a very rare treat.",1144800000,29,627,4.504424778761062
2434569,1,B000BP86QO,"I don't think musically this is one of Tchaikovsky's better works. It's too stirring and bombastic.  The score is filled with military marches, anthems and fanfares which lead to endless processions and parades.  You want to scream for it to stop and have a few quiet moments of tender, thought provoking arias. I can't fault the production on the DVD except for the ending when Joan ascends to heaven on a cloud of dry ice with her hands in shackles. I wanted to see flames licking at her body and the church hierarchy standing around smiling over their wickedness.  I believe Tchaikovsky missed a great musical moment by not writing terrific music for a trial scene.  Nina Rautio in the title roll is fantastic and all the supporting singers more then adequate.  The orchestra sizzled.  I'm going to see this opera on stage for my first time in San Francisco.  Perhaps this live event will make a fan of me but until then there are much better Russian operas out there to buy on DVD.  MAZEPPA comes immediately to mind.",1144627200,11,1021,4.633333333333334
2434570,3,B000BP86QO,"Tchaikovsky's The Maid of Orleans is one of those grand operas that flourished in the mid 19th century similar to Le Prophete and Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer. It calls for huge sets, chorus, orchestra and pagentry with a capital P. Not unlike the Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals we see today.  Therefore this is not an easy opera to bring off today. This is a pity because it has many wonderful moments and much good music. It certainly deserves to be seen just as often as say Andrea Chenier but I doubt there will be any rush to bring this opera back into the mainstream repertoire. Thanks go then to the Bolshoi for trying another way to make this opera viable in times of financial restraint. The director, Boris Pokrovsky, has conceived this opera as a hybrid between an oratorio and a mediival mystery play. The Met in New York went this route when they staged Le Prophete some years ago with mixed results. Here, the chorus in mostly modern dress (though the womens gowns could possibly pass as being gothic in style) are arrayed in tiers around the relatively economical unit setting. The chorus tends to comment on rather than take part in the action of the opera. There are suitably costumed extras for that. The setting on the whole works very well. The regular addition of banners & scrims adapted from illuminated manuscripts, well placed candleabri and flags the whole thing actually manages to simulate a sumptuousness and grandeur that it doesn't really have and that few can afford these days. The coronation scene manages to come off much better than one could hope for without actually resorting to CGI...
  The action is left to the principals. Among the singers there  are no letdowns. Nina Rautio is a superb Joan. She has a wonderfully full and creamy voice with great reserves of power. What she lacks is the last word in dramatic engagement with the role. Something a singer such as Waltraud Meier would have been outstanding at. I believe that Meier did attempt this role in Germany, she must have been shattering in intensity.
  The second soprano, Maria Gavrilova, jumps wholeheartedly into her less showy role of Agnes Sorrel, King Charles VII longstanding mistress. The male roles tend to be more window dressing in this opera and the singers Oleg Kulko,Gleb Nikolsky,Valdimir Redkin, and Mikhail Kruthikov do not disappoint us in any way. Their acting tends to be of the more melodramatic style of the old soviet era but it is not so out of place in this opera and provides us with a point of interest during some of the operas longer spots.
  One of the other reviewers commented on the soprano using the score at one point during the opera. Actually he missed the point...At various spots throughout the opera the chorus are asked by the director to sing from the score and one or two principals are also asked to do this. Pokrovsky seems to be trying to create an impression of an oratorio at those points. I'm not sure that it comes off as he intended. Certainly if the other reviewer didn't catch on it is a sign that it should have been rethought. It is in no way a reflection on the singers or the excellent chorus themselves.
  The orchestra play magnificently for Alexander Lazarev and Tchaikovsky provided this opera with a number of orchestral preludes which allow the cameras to spend time with the various musicians at work. Once or twice some of the musicians are brought up on the stage by the director which doesn't help to clarify the action but is a boon for the hardworking solo instrumentalists.
  The sound and picture of this dvd are excellent and there are subtitles in English,German,French,Italian,Portuguese, Spanish, and Japanese. also one should note that although this is a film of a fully staged performance, it was not recorded while the audience was present so like the various Bayreuth dvds available, there is no applause and the camera is permitted some very interesting camera angles that it normally wouldn't have managed in a live telecast.
  All in all a highly recommended  version of an opera we are unlikely to see another video of.",1140739200,52,4101,4.764456981664316
2434571,1,B000BP86QO,"I can't imagine anyone ever wanting to see this production a second time.  Send it back to Russia! They should be ashamed , putting this on DVD!  Have you ever seen an opera soprano pull out the score book to read her part ?  That's what this Joan does towards the last section.  The staging is very static, most people just stand there, although Joan's father is vigorous, and they did hire a choreographer apparently for a minute or two of a battle scene.  The chorus looks like a church choir in red robes singing from their score books, on stage, right next to the main actors, incongruous and intrusive. Why didn't they dress them up as peasants? I seriously object to Tchaikovsky's portrayal of Joan as a wavering, doubt-ridden Hamlet -- Hamlet Joan, with a lover. The music meant nothing to me, an amateur.",1135036800,6,813,4.5793103448275865
2434572,5,B000BP86QO,"Finally, this glorious production of this largely unknown opera by Tchaikovsky is available.  Having had a (dare I say it?) bad ""pirate"" print for some time, I am so looking forward to seeing it for the first time all over again.  The work has some of Pyotr Ilyich's most romantic music--the Act I Finale with Joan hearing her voices is wonderous.  Historic liberties are taken as Joan has a romance with an enemy soldier, thus leading to her imprisonment.  The production is elaborate yet not realistic.  Joan's end at the stake is something to be seen to be believed.  Now that we've gotten 'Mlada' and 'The Maid of Orleans', isn't it about time for Philips to release the DVD of 'The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh and the Maiden Fevroniya'?",1130457600,51,752,4.659090909090909

8090407,2,B000BP86QO,"All and all this is really a terrible opera.  The best music is in the first act and then again a short scene staged as a ballet in the first forest scene.  The music is mostly bombastic and lacks any sense of melody; sounds rather like endless recitative. The cast is more than first rate; the production superb.  Why the soprano needs to read the score in the forest scene is a mystery.  Was there no prompter?  Probably this was not a live staged performance...there's no applause, no curtain calls.  I kept thinking what Verdi would have done with certain situations.  But then again Verdi did write Giovanna D'Arco.  The librettos of both operas was based on Schiller's play.  (So he wrote at least one lousy play.)  There's no effort for historical accuracy.  Verdi's score has some beautiful music and is beautifully sung by a yound Tebaldi on a CD with Carlo Bergonzi and Rolando Panerai.  Caballe' has also recorded it under James Levine.",1466726400,,947,4.7073170731707314
8090408,5,B000BP86QO,"I did not do any previous research on this opera, but as soon as Nina Rautio let loose I sat totally upright, mesmerized.  This was no usual shrill Russian soprano.  She had the most amazing Spinto voice I have heard after (who else?) Leontyne Price!  And then I wonder why I had no recollection of her at the Met.  Well, it so happens that this very production was brought by the Bolshoi to the Met in 1991, and she was scheduled to sing the second performance of it, after having scored a hit as Tatiana in the same tour.  I traced her career and sure enough, she moved to La Scala and London and became an interpreter of the same repertoire as Ms. Price's.  However, she only appeared at the Met twice more, in Aida (her signature role) and Tosca.  There is only one recording of hers, interpreting Rachmaninoff's songs, and this DVD.

As for the opera itself, it's hard to stomach its source, Schiller's play, which includes some blatant and maybe absurd biographical fallacies.  However, the staging provides the much needed spectacle of grand opera, and the composer a trove of musical powerhouse voices.  Gavrilova provides unintentional comic relief, with her face frozen into a  silly grin no matter what the action is around her.  And what is the male chorus doing in tails, for Heaven's sake?  But it all can be forgiven.  An operatic masterpiece survives and Rautio's magnificent voice is preserved for posterity.",1411689600,,1425,4.739837398373984
8090409,5,B000BP86QO,"Absolutely gorgeous opera.  Beautiful sets and awesome lighting and special effects.  The costumes, too, are just great.  The director has members of the choir (I assume, maybe it's their only job) form the awesome tableaux on the set, which look just like old tapestries or illuminations.  If only it had been filmed in widescreen, but in general the filming and editing is quite good, looking where you want to look having a lot of full stage shots.

The music is wonderful, Nina Rautio sings just effortlessly, the singer for Lionel is beautiful too and they have a lovely duet.  Her father, Vyacheslav Pochapsk, is about the weakest of the bunch, some of the time he doesn't really seem to have the beat.  And he has a quite large part toward the end so it is a bit unfortunate, but everyone else is really just splendid.  And the orchestra too.  The music is quite well balanced between the orchestra and singers.

As for the opera itself.  It's interesting, it's a little hard to get past the historical inaccuracies of a story we know so well.  Here the French put her on trial because her father says she is a witch, because he believes women should stay home and get married.  Joan, meanwhile doesn't defend herself because she feels guilty over human feelings for Lionel.  It is a feminist story, rather than a political or a religious one.  It's a bit disappointing that it's not ""Joan of Arc"" though.

The music is all very nice, not really the sort of pieces you'll be humming after, but it really puts you in the action. I think Tchaikovsky really needed to give Joan one more aria after her death though, kind of like Tristan and Isolde.  As it is it's a bit like, ""what?  that's it?""",1410998400,2,1699,4.569536423841059

8090411,5,B000BP86QO,"As I've posted elsewhere, I don't know anything about opera. What I'm infinitely, 110%, obsessive-compulsively, totally, completely, utterly interested in is something apparently few people seem to have heard about. It's called...music. Not the words to some scrap of music; not how some singer struts and dances; not how many drugs some star imbibes...not any of that. Just music. I know; it's crazy. Imagine. Liking music. Actual music. Crazy.

The Maid of Orleans: music this good, the music in this amazing piece by Tchaikovsky, shouldn't be left to languish. Neglected, forgotten, rotting. Not when what you get here is a lot of good-to-really-great music by one of the supreme melodists and artists in history. A lot of forgotten, neglected music may be that way for a reason. But here, there's no good reason. This is fine music. And, you can take that from a guy who doesn't particularly follow opera (I just love music; see above). Musical excellence found here.

I'd like to address some of the objections raised by others below. Most of the comments against the production here have a fringe-dweller ring to them, and I think that any reader of average intelligence will quickly see them for what they are. The comments from the guy who blatantly stated that he ""doesn't care about music"" are exactly that. Random sputterings of some hostile music hater. You may also disregard a remark along similar lines from the guy who claimed that there aren't any melodies here. Well, there aren't any rock n roll melodies, but right from the start, Tchaikovsky gives you a ravishing melody for female chorus that'll enrich your life. It's wonderful.

Then there are all the guys who objected to the number of pieces for chorus in the opera. Maybe that's an opera-listener thing. Maybe opera experts hate choruses. Who knows; who cares? Personally, I love choral pieces...especially in opera. It breaks up the monotony of just hearing soloists singing. It sure beats listening to some guy barking tunelessly for hours, which is what I get from Wagner. The choral pieces here are well balanced against the rest of the singing.

Indeed, everything in the opera is so well balanced and constructed, it's just beggars the imagination that the opera would be neglected. As for the costumes and staging, they're all fine. No weird modern psycho-sexual-post-space-age-snide-angst-driven wackiness. Just visually wonderful staging that doesn't distract from, or insult, the music. ""Mixing constume periods"", blah, blah. Who cares? It all looks great and fits the music. There aren't many recordings of ""Maid"", so I say snap this one up while it's still around.",1360800000,8,2653,5.091954022988506
8090412,4,B000BP86QO,"They say this opus  is an old fashion Grand Opera , a never matching Pique Dame or Yevgeni Onegin by the same Tchaikovsky. That is true in my opinion.
  I ll not judge interpretation  (average in good shape) due to almost lack of comparision. Nevertheless , the opera has more musical substance than whole Meyerbeer ""oeuvre"". Preventing likely reactions by Meyerbeer s addicts, I do not pretend, I loathe him. This Tchaikovsky opera is among his 4 best, meaning Onegin, Dame of Spades, Yolanthe and Maid of orleans.

8090413,2,B000BP86QO,"The music's great of course, and the director, the orchestra and the singers are at their best.  The production on the whole, however, is ruined by a totally unexplicable mixture of different centuries, represented by the chorus in ridiculous 19th century outfits.  The angels look as if they had just been dragged out of an elementary school play.  It's not clear, how such an outstanding stage director as Boris Pokrovsky could come up with this immature performance.",1325894400,,469,5.064935064935065
8090414,5,B000BP86QO,"Tchaikovsky is one of a few composers whose numbered opuses have always been in demand due to their spectacular melodies combined with superb and unique orchestration. For Opera performance, obviously more resources and investment are needed and therefore the producers are wary about staging less popular operas. That may explain why some of Tchaikovsky operas are less performed than syrupy and canned Italian operas that appeal to common masses. In most Russian operas, melancholy and emotional suffering is the underlying theme intertwined with a popular storyline which, to some respect, is a reflection of Russian culture. Nevertheless, happy moments come about in bursts of joyful exuberance through dances in peasant feasts or in a ballroom but they are short and fleeting. The first time, I heard Maid of Orleans on an LP 25 years ago performed by Irina Archipova as the lead character. I was instantly smitten by the powerful voice of this great Russian Mezzo and the beauty of the arias. The story is about war and death and obviously the music matches the grueling periods of battles and suffering but it is Tchaikovskian in its true sense and it may take a couple of listening to get used to certain parts specially during the final act. To compare Maid of Orleans to Eugene Onegin is like comparing Manfred Symphony to Tchaikovsky's 5th. they are all great masterpieces each with different program and motifs.",1297468800,,1423,5.059574468085106
8090415,1,B000BP86QO,"Watched 20 minutes and said to hell with it.  Maybe it got better, I'll never know.  Production was fine.  So what. I didn't hear anything I would call a melody.  Love Tchaikovsky's symphonies (4,5,6) and ballets and VC and 1st PC.  Great tunes.  Really didn't expect tunes - never yet ran across an operatic composer (no, not even Rossini, don't like his operas either) who could write orchestral music or vice verse.  Was talked into buying it.  Bleah!",1220140800,,454,4.730769230769231
