7101077,5,B00VQRFEDE,"I give this five stars for nostalgic reasons. I first saw it when it came out in the early 50s and loved it, and I've waited quite a few years for it to come out on tape or DVD. This is what I remember from my first viewing: how amazingly handsome Rick Jason was, and a dance sequence in which Cyd Charisse rolled down a hillside. On second viewing, Jason is still startling handsome (even prettier than his lover Charisse!), and Cyd still rolls down that hillside, but it's obviously in a studio and much lower than I remembered it. Well, so much for memory and nostalgia. This is pretty obviously a B movie, but in gorgeous Technicolor with wonderful stars from the 50s.",1438128000,12,672,4.42741935483871

7101079,4,B00VQRFEDE,It feels very good to be able to see movies like this one. It's also very sad that they don't make clean entertainment for the whole family any more. Too bad!,1432512000,4,158,4.129032258064516

8710924,4,B00VQRFEDE,"All  the characters are stereotypes loosely based on Josefina Niggli's charming  book, but the film is so much fun that its pure Hollywood corn is part of its humor.  If this was photographed in Mexico, then the technicolor guy got too happy with his green paint brush; even the bare  mountain tops in the background are a lush jungle green. I don't see any agave plants, nopal prickly pear cactus or  mesquite groves. The church bell tower  is like many found in towns all over northern Mexico... If anybody can tell me WHERE in Mexico this was filmed, SPEAK UP. The church interior, in the scene where the policeman calls out the professor, is probably a very famous  historic church, I'm not sure where-- Puebla? San Luis Potosi?
Oaxaca?",1484784000,,740,4.689922480620155

8710930,4,B00VQRFEDE,"I got this film mainly for the starts and it is really an unusual film mixing three entirely different love stories.  One is a romantic comedy of sorts, one is a tragic love triangle, and the other a supernatural/horror tale.  Can't really think of any other movie like it.  The pairings each include one major star in Montalban, Charisse, and DeCarlo and Montalban's role is the best.  There is a great combination of studio sets that have that ""disneylandish"" Mexico feel and real beautiful Mexican scenery.  It also includes a nice score, though not a musical really it does include many popular latin tunes of the day in background.  Don't expect a classic by any means but it is a pretty interesting film to watch and if you like 50's Mexican scenery/imagery, you will probably enjoy it.",1452211200,8,792,4.744525547445256
