8144565,2,B000I99MB6,It had some damaged areas and it skipped a minute or on some of the episodes. Quality was not good and did not live up expectations!,1395273600,,132,4.115384615384615
8144566,1,B000I99MB6,"This was probably my fault for not checking the description very thoroughly.  However, this DVD was a ""DVD 4"" and will not play in a standard American DVD player at all.",1393718400,,169,4.451612903225806
8144567,5,B000I99MB6,"If you like Hot Fuzz or Shaun of the Dead, you can see where these guys got their start.  Filled with tons of pop culture references and in jokes so it's very easily re-watchable.",1360540800,,179,4.264705882352941
8144568,5,B000I99MB6,How much do I love Spaced?  The first series was exceptional and I was quite happy with the second though there were a few mis-steps.  The characters feel like people I know.  Their dialog is amazing.  It is quick witted and sharp.  Love the music and camera angles.  Spaced bleeds pop culture and the Gen X experience.,1176076800,2,319,4.508771929824562
