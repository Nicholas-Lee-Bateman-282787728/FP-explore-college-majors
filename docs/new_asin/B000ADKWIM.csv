8077962,5,B000ADKWIM,"I just purchased this DVD from Best Buy.  All I have to say is that I am thoroughly impressed.  Finally, the Fourth King, Masaki Kurusu, the Master of Light, is revealed.  With his arrival, characters old and new are being called back to the Limitless Fortress.  As if that wasn't enough, there are two background episodes starring Hevn and Paul, both adding new depths to these extraordinary two supporting characters.  Not only this, but intriguing new/old VOLTS members are introduced.  This volume brings the series to another climax, as great as, if not greater, than volume four.  We even see the battle grounds, the Mayan Temple, the Grand Canyon, etc. . ., again.  Himiko gets another grand fight scene; yes we see the speed perfume again.  Ban faces off once again with his arc-nemesis.  With only one volume left, this DVD sets the stage for a grand Get Backers finale.  The final 10 seconds of episode 45 leaves the viewer overly anxious for episode 46 which will be released on volume 10.  Now, the only questions are, how will they rap up the series in just four more episodes, and what will I do once this spectacular series is completed?",1126915200,3,1152,4.705
