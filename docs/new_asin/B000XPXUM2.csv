8317338,5,B000XPXUM2,"I produced this DVD of Dennis Hooker Sensei, and I hope you like it. There is a correction to be made - the principal uke (or receiver of throws) on the DVD is Mr. Tim Magill. The spelling on the DVD credits is Tim Magee. That is incorrect, and I extend my sincere apologies to Mr. Magill for the error.

Hooker Sensei does a wonderful job in the DVD of explaining, clearly and in depth, the concepts of ma-ai (correct distance) and zanshin (continuous mind) in Aikido. For those of you in Aikido who think you are completely familiar with these concepts, please take a second look. You won't regret it. For everyone else in the martial arts and in general, I think you will find this DVD will surprise and interest you.
