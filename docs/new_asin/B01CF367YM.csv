8752879,5,B01CF367YM,"I love all these behind the scenes stuff. It's so good to see what happened during Roxette's glory days. Wish there were more recording session, or at least one that are focus on one song, like they did in ""the making of Joyride"" (remember The Big L session?). The concert footage were too many and the live songs that were chosen were too repetitive. I get it, the director probably only wanted to choose the songs that are more familiar to wider audience, but I think most of the people who will purchase this DVD are the hardcore fans, I don't think the regular audience will enjoy this as much as us. Anyway, I still enjoyed this so much and will keep watching it over and over again.",1506902400,,688,4.3828125
