Previously, he recorded ""Pepi Luci Bom and other girls of the  heap"" (1978-80), ""Labyrinth of Passion"" (1982) an ""Dark  Habits""(1983), as well as a greast deal of short films.

329397,4,630142462X,"Black comedy doesn't necessarily have to be ""about"" anything in particular: it really just needs to express a certain cynicism (healthy or not) about contemporary life and culture.  Pedro Almodovar's earliest films have often been described in such terms, but I'm not entirely sure that's correct.  Absurdist, to be sure, skeptical--if not completely cynical--certainly, but even at his bleakest, there is a basically loving spirit on display.  He shows genuine affection for his characters, even the ones who don't seem to actually deserve it (the chauvinistic husband in this film, for instance, is still shown as a basically principled and decent-in-his-way sort).

It may well be that Almodovar's affection for, as well as his compassion toward, his characters is what grounds his absurdist comedies and what serves to make them more ""grey"" than completely ""black.""  I've read that he refuses to pronounce judgment on his characters, no matter what kind of trouble they create for themselves or others.  One senses that much in this relatively early film (his first international success).  Individual viewers may draw their own conclusions (as we all do in real life) about individual characters in the film.  I find it a strong point, rather than a weak one, that different viewers will come away from this film with differing impressions of the dramatis personae.

One of Almodovar's favorite leading ladies Carmen Maura appears here as the harried working class housewife Gloria, who's struggling (pretty much in vain) to maintain her family and her dignity by working 18-hour days (the drudgery of ""women's work"" has seldom been more graphically displayed).  Her husband and two sons are anything but supportive, each aware of Gloria's plight on some level but each choosing to remain demanding and difficult and capable of driving this particular woman towards a nervous break-down.

As readers of previous reviews may know, Gloria's husband is a taxi driver whose meagre earnings are not enough to support the family (although it may just be that he refuses to give his wife the money she needs to run the household, it's never made 100% clear).  Her adolescent son is already pushing drugs and her pre-teen son is hustling older men.  Theirs is a dysfunctional family with a capital ""D.""

The film's very absurdity would seem to guarantee that most viewers would NOT take its characters actions TOO seriously.  But it is interesting to see how some reviewers have commented on Gloria's willingness to hand over her son to the ""care"" of an obvious pederast (his dentist, who promises him enough to eat and music lessons--to say nothing of free dental work--in exchange for, well, you know).  That little plot twist, as well as the neighbor child's CARRIE-esque psychokinetic abilities should make it clear that we are entering the realm of the absurd here.

One of the most intriguing elements of Almodovar's work is his ability to create a zany alt-universe that has its own internal logic and sort of makes sense while we're viewing it.  That's certainly the case with this early work (although I could have done without the psychokinesis myself, an effect which almost undermines the bizarro logic of the film).  If Almodovar had never gone on to better things, this effort would be a fairly entertaining, quirky indie flick that might have some cult following.  It probably would not have been required viewing in anyone's book, however.  Given the significance of Pedro Almodovar's later work, though, it can certainly be considered essential viewing for scholars and admirers of the ""bad boy"" of Spanish cinema.",1203724800,4,3628,5.125636672325976
329398,4,630142462X,"Is this for bloody real? This is one weird family. Almost like the real, modern day Addams Family. Granny charges her own son for water. Son is a chauvinistic pig. A family living above poverty but way below comfortable. Sadness hidden behind daily lives of the people next to us",1184198400,,279,4.6
329399,5,630142462X,"Though the films by one of our geniuses of filmmaking in our times, Pedro Almodvar, is making films now that are polished to perfection - Volver (2006), La Mala educacin (2004), Hable con ella (2002), and Todo sobre mi madre (1999) - his early films such as this one 'Qu he hecho yo para merecer esto!!' in retrospect contained all the identifying marks that would establish him as not only one of the bad boys of cinema, but also one of the sensitive cinematic psychologists.  And everything he touches gleams.

In this 1984 story of a wildly dysfunctional family co-habiting in Madrid, the star is Gloria (Carmen Maura), a No-Doz addicted maid living in a tiny flat with her taxi driver/forger husband who perseverates on an aging German chanteuse for whom he once worked,  two sons - one a hustler and the other a drug peddler - and a wacko  mother-in-law who treats food like contraband, selling what she chooses to the family members.  The turning point in this raucously fragile but funny family is the chance to make money: the father is coerced into forging Hitler's memoirs with a little help from his German chanteuse's influence,

Gloria bargains with a dentist for her hustler son's possession, ad infinitum!

But leave it to Almodvar to pull it all off with just the right amount of madness and mayhem, and a jolly dollop of psychology about family interaction and women thrown in for good measure.  The cast is a delight (including Almodvar regulars Cecilia Roth and Vernica Forqu!) and the movie is so fast paced that it feels like a carnival ride - which is very much the way this marvelous director sees his early work.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, September 06",1158192000,12,1683,4.752577319587629
329400,5,630142462X,"Along with ""Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown"" this is my favorite from Almodovar. Almodovar's cinema is colorfull, symbollic, hilarious, absurd, and at times very brilliant. ""What Have I done to deserve this"" is a film which strikes me as being remarkably well organized and its meaning is grasped only after the entire film is digested.

Almodovar's style as a director falls somewhere between Sirk, Fassbinder, and Bunuel - a great combination of sound, image, lighting, color - mis en scene. I caution the viewer of this film not to take the subject matter of this film lightly - this is the work of a blossoming genius.",1120608000,4,632,4.798165137614679
329401,3,630142462X,"This movie can and will make you laugh. Picture the highly disfunctional family living in Madrid in the mid-eighties: the overworked mom who is addicted to amphetamines; a chauvinistic cab-driving dad, who is infatuated with a love of his younger years, and beats his wife; a crazy grandma with a pet lizard, who is obsessed with going back to the town where she came from; the drug-dealing 14 year-old son who makes more money than both his parents combined; and the youngest son who gives sexual favors to men of age. Take them, add the wackiest neighbors (a chatty prostitute who has the most unexpected customers; and a childbeating single-mother with a daughter with special powers), and you are bound to be shocked left and right, unless you are able to see beyond the obvious. Almodovar's making a statement (or an over-statement at that), about how urban life is bound to deteriorate family life as the bread providers struggle to make ends meet.

With a more humorous approach to moviemaking than in his recent movies, ""What Have I Done to Deserve This?"" is a black comedy that can stand well on its own. However, the one problem I have with it is that, in spite of the clear point he's trying to make, too many plot lines are started, many of which are not fully developed. You wonder why such or such scene had to be in the movie, if the character didn't end up being taken anywhere. Either this is the case or this version edited out some important moments in the stories of the different characters, but toward the end, you have an inevitable feel that you missed something in the movie, even if you ""get it"". Also, I have a problem with some of the elements presented (spoiler ahead), namely the highly surreal way in which the mom gives away her son to his dentist, a man in his thirties who is a clear sexual predator with an obsession for children.

This is why I give it 3 stars. It is far from his best movies, such as ""Talk To Her"", ""All About My Mother"", ""Bad Education"" and ""Live Flesh"".",1114300800,13,2009,4.53168044077135

Great characters such as the next door prostitute, the little redhead girl with telekinetic powers, the cheap grandma, the impotent policeman, the gay dentist, the two writers, and so on make for an interesting watch. Many classic lines are found in this one, like the newlywed who gets her face burnt from her husband spilling coffee on her ""I'll never forget that cup of coffee"" and ""I'm diabetic? oh, I always forget at dinner time?""
This film is not really driven by plot, but rather by the characters' lives. Like all Almodovar movies, it is a piece of art, a meditation and a comical look at life, sexual orientation, coincidence, destiny and love.",1077235200,12,726,4.816

329404,4,630142462X,"As a North American, one is subject to films which are essentially shallow, mindless and repetitious.  Rarely is there a film that comes as a surprise.  However, Qu he hecho yo para merecer esto offers a completely different cinematic experience. Pedro Almodovar's use of dark humor in Qu he hecho yo is what I found most appealing.  The film takes a peek into the lives of the members of a poor working class family and explores their many problems in a tragic but comic way.  The film opens with a shot of an enormous apartment complex similar to ""the Projects"" of the United States defining the films dark aspects and the tragic situation of the family.  Soon, the close up takes us into the tiny apartment which is decorated in humorously bad taste, ""kitsch"".  This allows the audience to relax and laugh as it reveals the film's dark humor.  Furthermore, the film deals with subjects such as prostitution, child molestation, adultery, murder, drug addiction, and poverty.  What I found most interesting was the way in which Almodovar manages to poke fun at these issues.  A North American film would never even dare to mention child molestation unless it suggested that the criminal would end up dead, however Qu he hecho yo presents a mother who allows her young son to live with his homosexual dentist after he makes advances towards the boy at his practice.  Interestingly, it is one of the films funniest moments.  Hence, the film is truly a must see for anyone wishing to escape the monotony of American cinema and who enjoys an unconventional  dark comedy.",974073600,31,1567,4.784386617100372

7811632,5,630142462X,"Pedro Almodvars fourth feature What Have I Done to Deserve This? (Qu he hecho yo para merecer esto?, 1984) is his first great film. In it he sharpens to perfection his attack on the old patriarchal system foisted on Spain through four decades of fascism under Franco by focusing on the effects of this legacy on a working class family after the advent of democracy in the 1977 general election. Gone is the rough, wild and undisciplined chaos of the La Movida Madrilea-charged Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980) and Labyrinth of Desire (1982) and gone is the genre-hopping dabbling of Dark Habits (1983) and its exclusive focus on Catholicism. Instead we have a diamond-sharp satire of slice of life Italian neo-realism transferred from the Italian city suburbs of Bicycle Thieves (1948, Vittorio De Sica) or Bellissima (1951, Luchino Visconti) to a dingy block of council flats in Madrid. The satire works brilliantly on two levels. Most obviously there is the personal level of everyday kitchen sink family drama which is hilarious from start to finish and makes for Almodvars funniest film to date. Underneath bubbles a superbly articulated level of metaphor in which the family represents Spain no less and the social dislocation caused by fascism with the concomitant necessity of finding a new identity in the transition from dictatorship to democracy. This search for identity becomes an obsession with Almodvar who will return to the same theme repeatedly in most of his later work. After repeated viewings I am convinced this is the film which most clearly announces Almodvars worldview, his view on men and women, on his country, on sexuality and on his own art. His later films are more polished and sophisticated (his postmodernity doesnt really begin to assert itself until The Law of Desire [1987] and his melodramas from The Flower of My Secret [1995] through to Volver [2006] have a deeply satisfying mature texture about them), but nowhere does he declare himself as openly as he does here. As such, though the first three films are never less than interesting, this would be the Almodvar film Id recommend newcomers see first. This will be a thematic review and so will contain spoilers  see the film before you read.

The films kitchen sink social satire works primarily as an inversion of the conventions that define Italian neo-realism. Like the early films of Rossellini, Fellini, Visconti and De Sica it is shot on location with little known actors and with a nod here and there towards documentary in its depiction of working class life. The film opens on a high shot looking down at a square where a film crew are assembled. Into their midst walks a dowdy repressed-looking middle aged woman. The cameras come alive and start to follow her as she enters a martial arts gym to Bernardo Bonezzis Nino Rota-esque music playing on the soundtrack. This woman is named Gloria (the amazing ever-versatile Carmen Maura) and the film charts her wretched everyday existence. She works 18-hour days as a cleaner and house-drudge for her husband, two kids and mother-in-law. So far so per the neo-realist remit, but the films inversion is stated immediately by a foregrounding of Glorias sexual repression. We never for one minute think of Anna Magnani ever going without sex let alone suffering from it, but here we have Gloria hilariously aping the members of a kendo class, her mop replacing the shinai (sword) as the phallus she is so desperately in need of. Immediate relief would appear to be on hand via a kenshi named Polo (Luis Hostalot) who invites her into his shower and attempts to take her up against the wall. A scene poised for tension-relieving orgasmic passion goes limp as a noodle, the man proving to be impotent (its no surprise in an Almodvar film that he turns out to be a policeman!). Poor, humiliated and still sex-starved, Gloria has to trudge home where we meet the members of her dysfunctional family; her abusive autocratic male chauvinist pig taxi driver husband Antonio (ngel de Andrs Lpez) who treats her as a slave demanding his dinner, his shirts be ironed, his wife stay at home (even though she has to make the money he fails to put on the table), and his sexual demands be met (without satisfying hers); her dotty soda pop/cake loving diabetic mother-in-law Abuela (Chus Lampreave) who won't stand her son being abused (!), miserly refuses to help, (mis)educates her grandchildren and has a passion for gambling and lizards; and her two children  the drug taking/dealing 14 year old Toni (Juan Martinez) and the 12/13 year old self-declared homosexual Miguel (Miguel ngel Harranz) who lets old men sleep with him before being sold by Gloria to a pederast dentist (the salacious Javier Gurruchaga leering deliriously) to pay for his expensive bridge. Her life a complete travesty of stressful heartbreak, Gloria takes to painkillers and descends into drug addiction. Contrast all this with the Italian family as depicted in neo-realist films  gutsy mother, rough but well-intending father, poor maligned grandparents and the tragedy of everyday life mirrored in the faces of angelic children  and the topsy-turvy satire is obvious. It is also side-splittingly hilarious. I especially love granny teaching Toni the difference between romantic and realist writers and dads brazen and completely straight-faced chauvinist demands for dinner from his obedient wife who scrapes to his every order while he has to buy a bottle of pop from his miserly mother.

As in Italian neo-realist films, the tragedy of family life is contrasted and heightened through other characters living in the same building, especially the whore next door Cristal (the wonderful Vernique Forqu in a role initially offered, but turned down by Victoria Abril), Glorias best friend who is a rich source of wicked comedy  she will shag anyone for money or drugs (even propositioning Glorias kids), wears the most outrageous costumes (designed by Cecilia Roth!) and presides over her tacky love den with the preening delight of a voracious dominatrix. Highlights include her looking for a whip to satisfy a customer, donning a ridiculous wedding dress to seduce Miguel in order to score heroin from his brother, and a hilarious scene where Gloria is coerced into watching an exhibitionist client talk dirty, strip and then screw. Her role is a parody perhaps of the whore at the center of the love triangle in Rocco and his Brothers (1960, Visconti), but far from the tragedy essayed in that film, Cristal has eyes on a bright future  as a Las Vegas showgirl, hence listening to an English radio program while she attempts to cure Polo of his impotence. Representing the diametric opposite type of woman is the mousy sexually repressed Juani (Kiti Mnver who will play the same type as the reptilian feminist lawyer in Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown [1988]), a tyrannical monster mother who terrorizes her poor daughter Vanessa (Sonia Hohmann) for reminding her of her husband who (understandably!) has left her. Her brutality is darkly funny and induces telekinetic powers in Vanessa who hilariously takes her revenge by trapping her in a lift, moving a vase to fall on her head, and then later adopting Gloria as a surrogate mother by helping her decorate simply by moving furniture, wall paper and paste with her mind. Completely off the wall, these sequences are a hoot and again showcase Almodvars comic bravura. The director also gets to make a ridiculous appearance singing an opera aria to his drag partner Fabio McNamara in a TV CM. His pirouette is as bizarrely outrageous as the coffee CM which has Cecilia Roths face disfigured by service in bed. TV is an ever-present part of (especially) working class life and (as in all his other films) Almodvar brilliantly sends it up as a determinator/barometer of what passes as average behavior in the wider world.

Where the film departs from neo-realist precedent is in the depiction of outside middle class characters and a trip outside Spain to her old friend Germany. Seen simply as a kitchen sink satire, this element of the film may appear to be tacked on, but it fits superbly into the underlying political subtext which I will come onto shortly. One of Antonios taxi fares turns out to be the unsuccessful writer Lucas Villalba (the bearded Fernando Rey lookalike Gonzalo Suarez) who is en-route to Cristal for an afternoon poke. He cottons on to Antonios past employment in Germany as chauffeur to a German singer named Ingrid Muller (Katia Loritz) and especially his ability to forge handwriting. Propositioned to make a mint by forging Hitlers diary Antonio self-righteously baulks at the criminal suggestion. Knowing Antonio is in love with Frau Muller Villalba goes to Berlin to get the woman to come to Madrid in order to convince him to do the forgery. Cristal has meanwhile introduced Gloria to the Villalbas including Lucas lazy bourgeois wife Patricia (Amparo Soler Leal) who thieves from her psychiatrist brother-in-law Pedro (Emilio Gutirrez Caba) to get the money for the Berlin airfare. Gloria cleans the homes of both brothers which turn out to be equally as chaotic as her own. Class status may differ, but everyone is broke regardless. Pedro is also an alcoholic besotted with his lost love Marisol and is every bit as screwed up as the worst of his patients. Naturally it is to him that Polo the impotent cop goes (with his fake girlfriend Cristal!) for professional help in another classic comic scene. It is through the connection between Antonio and Ingrid Muller that the films smattering of plot is generated. Gloria and Antonio at war with each other over money (or lack of), Antonio turns all sweet when Frau Muller calls his home and he smooches her in German. Gloria is struck by jealousy especially as he listens to Frau Muller singing a German song all the time and orders her to iron a shirt so he can meet his love at the airport. Glorias refusal is met with a face-slap which is counter-acted by her asserting her virility kendo-style by bashing him on the head with a giant hambone. Antonios head catches the kitchen counter and he dies. The film borrows heavily from Roald Dahls Lamb to the Slaughter as the resulting police investigation (Polo again of course!) fails to find the murder weapon and squishes the only witness (a blood-splattered lizard), meaning Gloria escapes the consequences. Antonio gone, his mother decides to return to her village with Toni. A return to roots and the promise of rejuvenation is a key theme in Almodvar and it gets its first statement in this film. Abuelas companion on the bus turns out to be Francisca Caballero (Almodvars own mother in the first of 4 cameo appearances for her son) and the assumption is grandmother and grandson will start their lives over free of the domineering father. Gloria is left alone and suicidal, her balcony jump saved by the return of her youngest son Miguel who has tired of the lustings of his dentist guardian. Everyone in this particular family gets to start again (apart from Antonio of course!) and the final shot of the road is something of a signature send off for this director, the road of life finishing so many of his other films.

This film is a wonderful satire that works beautifully on the surface level of kitchen sink drama turned into dark comedy. The mayhem is beautifully judged by the director who directs an ensemble of pitch perfect performances. The satire on neo-realism is knowing and well-judged, the jokes rolling in so fast we barely have time to catch breath let alone notice the altogether deeper and (for this director) pertinent portrait of Spain and the societal dislocation that was very real in the early 1980s. Francos fascist dictatorship had effectively finished two years after his death when the old administration collapsed and a general election in 1977 saw the advent of democracy. The transition wasn't as simple as that though. Francos legacy was controversial with many people still upholding the right wing values he championed even if many others celebrated their newly gained freedoms. Almodvar has always been on the side of the newly liberated democracy and in this film he depicts a Spain divided into conflicting social groups all searching for their identity in a new society. The central dysfunctional family represents a dysfunctional Spain with the surrounding characters representing specific types who react differently to the birth of democracy.

Quite clearly the father Antonio represents enduring fascism and a right wing assertion of a continuation of male patriarchy. He sees himself as the bread winner and his wife as the person who should stay at home and mind the kids (it should be remembered that even as late as the early 70s Spanish women were expected to stay home. They weren't even allowed to have bank accounts without the signed assent of a male family member). The male chauvinism I have already described fits the type as well as his rejection of Villalbas offer to forge Hitlers diary (that would be a crime abhorant to a strict upholder of law and order!) and the fear of his mother. Abuela named her son after Saint Anthony, a Franciscan Catholic priest whose picture (Strozzis Saint Anthony of Padua Holding Baby Jesus) hangs on her bedroom wall. St. Anthony was famed for his knowledge of scripture and a veneration of hand-written books before the invention of the printing press. Hes the patron saint of finding things or lost people, and of poor people. Hes also considered to be a marriage saint famous for reconciling couples. This is all commented on with wicked irony through Antonio who prides his ability at copying handwriting, finds his lost love Ingrid Muller through chance, presides over his poor family by keeping them poor and effectively destroys his own marriage with Gloria by chasing after an old flame. Remember  the Catholic Church was the very instrument used by Franco to enforce the prevailing patriarchy which strangled Spain for so long.

Furthermore, Antonio has a fond affection for Germany. Hitler was Francos main supporter during the Civil War and German support was key throughout World War Two when Spain stayed officially neutral but unofficially dependent on her northern friend. Antonios love for Frau Muller equates precisely with Spains love for Germany and this is spelt out very clearly in the lyrics of the song he keeps singing in German and forces Gloria to listen to throughout the film:

Dont Cry Just About Love (Nur nicht ans liebe weiner  Theo Machaben / Hans F. Beckman)
Its the same,
Whomsoever we love,
And whoever breaks our heart.
We are driven by fate
And the end is always a sacrifice.
( )
We came from south and the north
With hearts so odd and speechless
Thats how I became yours
And I cant tell you why.
For when I lost myself to you,
I thought of another.
So the lie was already born
on the first night.
Dont cry just about love,
There are more than just the one on Earth.
(NB: I post the text of the compete song in both German and English as a comment at the bottom of this review)

In the context of the film this song refers on one level to the love of Antonio for Frau Muller while also being in a relationship with Gloria. On another level it refers to the love of Spain for Germany while forgetting the real Spain. The selling out of a wife is equated with the selling out of a country and is chauvinistically justified because all love is the same and is not to be cried about! In the film we learn Antonio has copied the work of a Nazi writer and it is implied he is still connected to Germanys Nazi past through Frau Muller. The fact that he is excited about rekindling this past relationship is quite clearly a symbol for the persistence of fascism in Spain even after the 1977 general election. It is significant that in 19 films the only time Almodvar takes us away from Spain (apart from a fleeting visit to a Caribbean market in High Heels [1991]) is here, and the country he chooses is Germany. Not only does he connect Spain and Germany through fascism, but he also connects specifically the Spanish and German bourgeoisie which was where the core of fascist support lay. Antonios mcp behavior is not excused in this film (indeed it is punished!), but to an extent the domestic crisis that leads to his death is brought about by the bourgeoisie manipulating him. This perhaps mirrors the circumstances under which the Spanish Civil War began back in 1936, only in this film it is democracy that wins out through Gloras glorious assertion of her long-repressed sexuality. In this Almodvar is re-writing the civil war by giving it the (for him!) correct ending.

We already met a male chauvinist fascist pig husband in the rapist policeman in Pepi, Luci, Bom and in virtually every Almodvar film these figures keep reappearing to remind us of the persistent fascism that plagues Spain. Indeed with this director the male characters generally fall into one of two groups. The first is the Antonio type who yearns to return to the fascist brutality of the past and its bourgeois patriarchy. The second is the free emancipated type keen to celebrate the new found freedom. In this film this is exemplified by the two sons who between them revel in the freedoms denied to Almodvar himself when he was growing up in Francos Spain. Both are independent  one has openly declared his homosexuality and the other is playing around with drugs. Both things were forbidden under Franco and both things the director had yearned to do as a child. When Miguel returns to his mothers nest he has a proper chance at doing something with his life now the patriarch has been deposed and when Toni returns to the village to work the land it is also the picture of rejuvenation and hope for the future of Spain. The cop Polo is an interesting character. Normally in an Almodvar film the policeman would be a fascist upholder of law and order, but here its as if the general election has robbed the police of their potency. Polo isn't keen on investigating Antonios death even when Gloria confesses to him, and seems to be as content as her kids to enjoy the new democratic freedoms (sex lessons with Cristal, snorting cocaine) even though the transition to democracy has castrated his powers. His balls have been cut off so as to be effectively neutered.

Almodvar treats his women the same way as the men. The fascist here is clearly Juani, the general election clearly signaling the freedom for her long suffering husband who has left her in the lurch. She is clearly an extension of Luci from Pepi, Luci, Bom, a mousy masochist who yearns for the punishments of the past. She wears conformist gray and brown throughout and exerts her tyrannical power by traumatizing her poor daughter. For Almodvar this is clearly a definite character type in Spanish society and is caricatured to underline the point. Opposed to Juani are the women reveling in their new-found freedom. Most obviously there is Cristal who puts her heart and soul (as well as considerable entrepreneurial nous) into her work to achieve her American Dream of making it to Vegas. Theres a peach of a confrontation between these two opposite character-types when Cristal expresses her shock at the way Juani treats her daughter. Since when do you have feelings? Juani counters deliciously, I thought you only feel through your c***. Gloria is the woman in transition who perhaps represents the majority  the putdown drudge who finally sees the light, and the film is centrally about how she (and many like her) finds her own identity in changing circumstances. Antonio wants her to conform and be a typical stay at home dowdy hausfrau, but she undergoes a transformation and finally breaks through her sexual repression by killing her repressor with a phallic hambone. She becomes a symbol for the new liberalized (sexualized) democratic Spain and Almodvar celebrates her as a role model he wants all women suffering under domestic fascism to emulate. In film after film Almodvar will feature strong women and celebrate their friendship/sisterhood bonding together to throw off the chains of the dominant male patriarchy. This theme was stated clearly in Pepi, Luci, Bom and gets its definitive statement in the majestic melodrama Volver made some 26 years later. That film will also celebrate the great return to roots, to the village of Spanish folklore (Volver means return in Spanish) which is voiced in this film through the character of Abuela and Almodvars own mother. In one sense they are the mothers of the generation that traumatized a nation through fascism, but in another they are guiltless because they were themselves traumatized and denied freedoms when they were young. In this sense although we can see Abuelas child-rearing as resulting in the repressive male chauvinist machismo of Antonio, one can hardly judge her when she herself was raised to be a household drudge denied the freedoms Gloria finally seizes at the end of this film.

What Have I Done to Deserve This? is fascinating for putting in front of us all the character types that will re-appear throughout the rest of Almodvars films. He is not thought of primarily as a political director, but politics are stated overtly here (especially through the unprecedented trip to Germany) and re-appear more subtly in later films such as High Heels, Live Flesh (1998), Bad Education (2004), Broken Embraces (2009) and Im So Excited! (1913). Just because Almodvar doesnt obviously refer to politics in most of his other films doesnt mean they are not there. Its as if he assumes audiences know the political/historical background (his films are addressed unashamedly to Spanish audiences and make few concessions to foreigners) and doesnt have to constantly refer to it, at least not obviously so. He does refer to it explicitly in this film and posits characters who are searching for their identity in a new Spain, but in future films this search for identity is refracted through sexuality and a long series of characters who have gender issues. A repressed homosexual growing up in the Franco years but suddenly given the freedom to be himself, Almodvar makes the search for sexual identity and an expression of hitherto repressed taboo desires the center of attention in his films. This is expressed most succinctly perhaps in All About My Mother (1999) by the transsexual character Agrado who points to the various operations performed on her body as making her who she really is. The search for political/social identity and the search for sexual identity are opposite sides of the same coin as a close study of this remarkably lucid film abundantly reveals.",1452988800,2,22730,4.901767151767152

7811634,5,630142462X,"Yes I said it,This Pedro Almodovar's best film from the 1980s. This film is wacky and surreal but serious in how a low income family struggles in 1983 madrid. Carmen Maura is simply wonderfull in the lead the entire cast is very effective. The dvd transfer is excellent. Buy it before it goes out of print.",1391126400,2,306,4.482142857142857
7811635,5,630142462X,"This is an entertaining and funny film, yet not without pathos and an urban gritty feel which lends poetry but gets progressively funnier as you get past the shock value of the characters and their lives.  Could almost be seen as a spoof on the British ""kitchen-sink"" dramas of the 50s and 60s except this was made in 1984 and in Spain. I'd thought it was from the 70s, but no.  ""All in the Family"", ""Married With Children"", ""6 Feet Under"".. those families dysfunctionalities seem tame indeed after riding along with the folks in this Madrid-set story.  You'll probably pick up a bit of Spanish along the way. It's occasionally quite touching in spite of itself.  The Spanish to English subtitle translation is very good as well.",1302220800,,729,4.716535433070866
7811636,4,630142462X,"This early, less-commercial film of Almodovar's contains many of his themes that are developed and expanded in his more mature films.  Case in point--the murder of Gloria's husband--a similar scenario is explored once again in ""Volver"".  I also observed the influence of John Waters--""What Have I Done to Deserve This"" sometimes reminds me of ""Polyester"".  Pedro's early films, especially, feature a Waterseque type of outrageous humour; WHIDTDT also makes me think of Francois Ozon's ""Sitcom"".  Also, Roald Dahl co-wrote the script for WHIDTDT with Almodovar.  The look of ""What Have I Done to Deserve This"" is also striking; for instance, the tacky, brash decor of the crowded apartment containing Gloria and the rest of the dysfunctional family--in contrast to Almodovar's later films with bigger budgets, brighter colors, and more bourgeois settings.  Carmen Maura is definitely the star of this film; with her natural style, she is always compelling.  Also of note is Almodovar's expansive take on sexuality-- IE the scene with the exhibitionist and the orgasm-faking prostitute.  Other highlights include; (1) the portrayals of the streetwise and precocious drug dealing teenage sons, who are also strangely reverent towards their grandmother; (2) the humourous television clips, filmed as visual asides, one featuring Pedro as a character in a soap opera, lip-sinking to a fantastic song that I have yet to locate via Amazon as an MP3; (3) the 10 or 11 year old ""Sissy Spacek""  la ""Carrie"" type--a gifted telekinetic with an abusive mother; (3) the comic subplots--IE one involving Ingrid Muller, the suicidal German woman; and (4) the German songs themselves.  I prefer ""What Have I Done to Deserve This"" to ""Matador"", and after having seen WHIDTDT, I'm starting to take a fancy to this less polished and more brutally comic side of Almodovar--as opposed to the sensibility of his later, sleeker, and more dramatic works-- IE his films made after 1993.

7811637,4,630142462X,"Dark and twisted, but somehow at the same time sweet and human. A very funny look at a very dysfunctional family.  Mom ends up killing dad, one kid is a drug dealer, the other is a doctor's teenage gay lover, and their neighbor is a happy hooker.  Sort of a family sit-com on acid.

Some wonderful performances, and even moments real emotion sneaking in here and there.  It does start to wear down by the end, and doesn't add up to a lot (other than being part off the young Almodovar's stick in the eye of the old repressive Spanish order) , but it's unique and kind of lovable, like it's characters.",1279756800,2,601,4.339285714285714
7811638,3,630142462X,"This satirical film goes by with no laughs while posing as a comedy. It's only when you think about what's on the screen, that you see the darkness. Aldomovar hits a lot of vices here: sex, drugs, child molestation, prostitution, murder. Yet, none of these normally titillating topics seem to go very far here. The film sits there and washes past you. What does it all mean? That's up to you, but it's a typical European film with ambiguities and things left unsaid that seem momentous, but which may not be, in reality. Interesting views of working class life in Madrid that tourists don't see.",1231286400,,595,4.6761904761904765
