8090321,5,B000BP351U,I watched this movie because its lead actor was hot in the preview of another Aussie classic. If you like seeing men in tight shorts and half naked then this film is a must. See groins revealed! Nice work.,1353888000,,205,4.282051282051282
8090322,3,B000BP351U,"A critical disaster on its first release in Australia and disowned by its director, Ken Hannam, Summerfield is nowhere near as bad as contemporary critics made out, but it's no wrongly maligned forgotten classic either. Instead it's one of those films that starts well only for the answer to its central mystery-within-a-mystery to become so obvious that you're expecting a different and much better twist that doesn't come, and for which the final revelation behind the disappearance that triggers it simply isn't strong enough to compensate for. Chief culprit is Cliff Green's script, which throws in some incredibly obvious clues awkwardly delivered in moments of stilted and self-conscious dialog that's so out of keeping with the rest of the script that they might as well have erected a billboard: especially ironic considering how elliptical his work on Picnic at Hanging Rock was.

There is a good sense of the atmosphere of subdued hostility born of boredom and malaise so prevalent in small towns as Nick Tate's replacement teacher takes up his new post and gradually finds himself drawn into the disappearance of his predecessor, a matter of total indifference to the locals, and a child with a rare blood disease who lives on a remote island with her mother and uncle. Early scenes, such as his pupils welcoming him by staging a hanging of one of their number or a bit of curious behavior in a card game between his landlord and the local cop even give off a faint aroma of Wicker Men, although there's no pagan or supernatural element at play here - the influence is more Chabrol that Shaffer. The Churchill Island location and photography are striking and Bruce Smeaton's hauntingly beautiful score quite superb and it's worth watching, but just a little more attention paid to the script could have helped the film realize its potential.

No complaints about Umbrella's Australian DVD - a beautiful 1.85:1 widescreen transfer, a 22-minute on-set documentary from 1977, a new and fairly candid 50-minute documentary with most of the key players, trailer and stills gallery.",1148688000,2,2087,5.046376811594203
