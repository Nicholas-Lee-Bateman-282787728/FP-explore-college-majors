2423084,5,B000BKVS6O,Very good suspense movies released in the 70's. It is a classic of the Mexican TV screen from October 31st to November 2nd. All the actors are excellent in their roles.,1220659200,3,168,4.451612903225806

2423086,5,B000BKVS6O,"This, again, is another masterpiece of director and writer Carlos Enrique Taboada. I have read some other critiques requesting English subtitles and I think that this should be included in all of Taboada's films. Unffortunately Churubusco Studios (Mexico's Hollywood) does not have a general DVD producer. And most of the DVD editions of these films are independent DVD producers whose audience is mostly Spanish-speaking. Thus they do not believe they need to add English subtitles. Hopefully a major U.S. DVD producer will pick these films up and re-release them with bonus features and English subtitles.",1213920000,3,607,5.4
2423087,4,B000BKVS6O,"I heard about this movie years ago, and suddenly forgot about it (im 24 years old).

Suddenly, after a movie talk with friends someone mentioned it again and I found myself with the urge of finding this gem, BUT SADLY, it hasn't been edited in our own Mexico! Shame on us, and kudos for Tekila Films who had the pants to capture and reproduce this amazing movie.

The Movie: Superb story, still fresh. The acting is not the strong thing in this movie, but they do a good job, all of them. I wish I studied something related to communications just to see the flaws on this movie. But apart from some minor continuity stuff it's amazingly well done.

The DVD: I would've put 3 stars for the lack of extras (the only extras are some Mexican leyends in spanish text). But its a Mexican film from the 60's that has been ignored in Mexico now. I would've rated a 5 STAR if it had english/french subtitles at least! since this is a ""cult""(if you will) movie for the genre lovers. Hopefully in a near future, people in Mexico rescue this extraordinary movie and issues it with more extras.

If you're a fan of suspense, mysteries or thrillers regarding ""horror"", this is a MUST in your colletion. You can almost ignore the fact that there are no subtitles (for people not understanding spanish) since the storyline is not that complex.",1168214400,6,1327,4.516666666666667
2423088,5,B000BKVS6O,This old scary movie is a good one to watch... eventhough it's old still gives you chills.  An old house is haunted by the spirit of a little boy and becomes friends with a little girl that moves into that house. She becomes obssesed with her friendship with this little ghost boy who makes her do things ....,1167782400,2,309,4.327586206896552
2423089,5,B000BKVS6O,"This is one of the scary movies I saw as a young kid, I remember being afraid of Hugo for weeks. I was recently surprised to find it on DVD and bought it immediately, the story it still creepy considering the time when it was conceived and filmed but don't expect great cinematography or acting in fact I think the support actors Norma Lazareno and Aldo Monti did a better job than the leading actors and a special mention to the little girl who played Silvia who did a good job in a couple of scenes. FYI: the boy who played Hugo [Pablo Carrillo] is a famous sports comentator in Mexico for ""Grupo Imagen"" and ""Fox Sports en Espaol""",1166486400,,633,4.3277310924369745

8088232,4,B000BKVS6O,"Truly creepy horror story.  Mexican-made, Spanish-language late 1960's film.  Sadly no subtitles but one should not have much trouble following the story.  A live-in governess/nanny is hired to teach and care for a disturbed pre-teen girl.  The family lives in an estate with large grounds.  Deep in the far garden is a strange, helluva creepy statue of a young boy holding an open book.  The little girl is obsessed with this statue that she calls Hugo.  In fact Hugo becomes her imaginary friend.  She starts talking of how Hugo and she have conversations, share books, and Hugo even comes to visit her.  The adults become concerned when strange things start happening.  The whole thing comes to a supernaturally tragic conclusion.  Worth seeing.  The Tekila Films DVD release is fine quality except at one point when it goes out of sync.  Thankfully that doesn't last long.  Highly recommended.",1405814400,,897,5.01360544217687

8088234,4,B000BKVS6O,This Mexican horror film is part fantasy and thriller.  It is a dark ride into a nightmare and legend that takes hold of a little boy.  I discovered this gem about 15 years ago and still feel it is one of the best Mexican horror films.  The atmosphere is dark and foreboding.  The ending is predictable but well-staged.,1383523200,,319,4.448275862068965
8088235,5,B000BKVS6O,the movie was ok.  Its very dynamic in a monotone kind of way.  The characters play a big part in the whole story,1380672000,,113,3.869565217391304

8088237,3,B000BKVS6O,"EL LIBRO DE PIEDRA, escrita y dirigida por Carlos Enrique Taboada (La Recta Final), es una pelicula interesante que sin duda fue influida por la pelicula inglesa, THE INNOCENTS de 1961.  Me refiero aqui al ambiente de una mansion en el campo y el uso de ni~os como personajes de los sobre natural.

Lamento que aunque una buena pelicula, podria haber sido una verdadera cinta clasica si no fuera por los multiples errores en escena.  Por ejemplo, con tanta dificultad sube Marga Lopez a la iglesia abandonada y para bajar es de un momento a otro.  El accidente automovilistico fue mal dirigido y no tiene nada de suspenso y los efectos especiales estan tercermundistas.  Peor aun es cuando la guapisima esposa muere y luego el personaje de Cordero se OLVIDA DE ELLA POR COMPLETO en las proximas escenas!!!  Dije yo, ""que la pasa a este hombre???""  Tambien, el primer tomo de ""Hugo"" da miedo, pero despues . . . ya se ve que es un ni~o haciendo muecas y no da nada de miedo.  Bueno, pues, ni modo.

Ah, pero no hay que perderse a la hermosisima Lilia Castillo (Lilia Richard aqui, si se acuerdan de ella con su minifalda en ALERTA ALTA TENSION y una de las p___s del general Mapache en THE WILD BUNCH), quien es definitivamente una de las mas bellas mujeres en el cine internacional que jamas gano la fama que se merecia.",1286323200,,1320,4.5358649789029535
