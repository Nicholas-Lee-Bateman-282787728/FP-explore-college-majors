1941498,5,B0000SXK0Y,"...but it is well worth your time.  It is a moving documentary of a crime that may or may not have happened.  It leaves more questions unanswered than answers them, unfortunately.  Well worth renting or buying, especially for the extras on the DVD.",1076544000,2,248,4.72093023255814
1941499,5,B0000SXK0Y,"This documentary is several things at once. First and foremost, it's the story of a family. Using the Friedmans' video and photo archives (before the arrests for child pornography, and after), the director has edited together a dramatic picture of an almost-typical suburban American family. They are fun-loving but they betray each other, they look up to their parents but they also despise them in subtle ways, and they struggle with faith and forgiveness when they are under pressure. If there were no arrests and no charges of child molesting, this would still be a compelling story because the Friedmans' emotional ties are so complex.
Second, there's the child molesting charges. This topic is long and detailed. The key to it is the hysteria of the police, the sex crime experts, the judge, the lawyers, and the neighbors. It is very instructive to see the woman in charge of the sex crime unit claiming that ""child porn was in stacks, out in the open, all over the house."" Everyone watching the documentary knows that this is false. The judge then says that she knew Arnold and Jesse Friedman were guilty before she even heard the case. It's a special kind of hysteria that grips the community. People are scared, they want relief, and the Friedmans are given a choice between a long jail term and a very long jail term. Although Arnold Friedman is clearly a pedophile, the people who want him in jail don't bother to assemble a real case against him. (The director makes this point well in the Charlie Rose interview on the second disc.)
Finally, the documentary shows you something about the life of an admitted pedophile. Obviously, this isn't to anyone's taste, but it is worthwhile to learn why Arnold Friedman was attracted to children, how he dealt with it, and the consequences he faced. Rather than depict him as a depraved monster, the director shows Arnold Friedman for what he was --- a very troubled man who is (figuratively) the guy next door.
This DVD comes with a lot of extra material on the second disc. Almost every frame of it should have been in the original film --- but if it was all in there, the movie would have been four hours long. Two moments on the second disc stand out. They are both impromptu discussions by people involved in the case, talking in a theater after the film has been screened. Those moments add a lot more crucial information.
I highly recommend this DVD. The material may be a bit shocking, but it's something anyone can handle. It will spark a long night of discussion, which may be the best thing any documentary can do",1076371200,10,2578,4.693156732891833
1941500,5,B0000SXK0Y,"It must be horrible having your life on display. However,
excellent documentarian Andrew Jarecki and team, have given
the accused and the family a chance to defend themselves. It
questions the questioners. It is a human drama that delves into
the quicksilver that is man.
All seems so normal early on. The home movies of the sons,
doing what all kids do in home movies, becomes less nostalgic
when you know what is going to happen. Which is one of the
main points--anyone can be made to look guilty of anything, if
it's done right. It can happen with threatening and leading
questions, coercion, the potential ostracism that might occur
otherwise.
Arnold Friedman, the father, is not H.H. Holmes, a mass killer.
Their house is not a horror chamber,but the unease, the
queasiness of the things, though seemingly off in McMartin
land,  with more than a few crazed conclusions, makes one
consider.  How would one justify one's life if they had been
partly right, totally wrong, or created lies? How do you dissect
the soul, the emotions, the heart of this particular sadness? The
relish one former alleged victim goes into in detailing what
happened to him seems to come from an exhibitionistic display,
which must kill the Friedmans.
The terrifying ease of judging other humans completely and
totally, says much about all of us, that we need someone to
blame for anything. It's just good to have a finality of source.
Then it's on to someone else.
The film  is honest, level, full of contradictions of behavior, a
dichotomy between words and weeping and accusations
within the family.",1076198400,2,1582,4.87360594795539
1941501,5,B0000SXK0Y,"Simply put, CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS is one of the best documentaries I have seen in recent memory. It follows the story of the Friedman family the prosperous suburb Great Neck in Long Island, New York. In the late 1980's Alfred Friedman (the father) is investigated after a package addressed to him containing child pornography is apprehended by the post office. After the Friedman's house is searched the investigation is turned over to the police when it is believed that young boys could have been sexually assaulted by Alfred while taking computer lessons in the family's basement. But the finger isn't solely pointed at Alfred as the name of his youngest son, Jesse, is continually mentioned during interviews of the alleged victims. Both Alfred and Jesse are accused of an unspeakable crime with the force of a witch-hunt in their local community. With no physical evidence the two are forced to defend their innocence and stand before the judge. What is at the true heart of this film is that there are no black and white sides of this drama; rather, there are only shades of grey, and plenty of them. As the film progresses it is revealed that Alfred is not 100% innocent. He confides that he has felt pedophilic impulses since his youth and enjoys the ""company"" of young boys. Furthermore, the fact that he was originally investigated for possessing kiddy porn never vanishes. It first appears that Jesse is the true victim but even these thoughts are never verified. Throughout the viewer is left wondering what really happened. The Friedman family was never a strong or a close-knitted family before these allegations were charged. As a result, their home videos caught a family in continual rage and despair. This incident truly tested their foundation. This family will never recover. The format of this film includes news footage, family home videos, and present day interviews of individuals on both sides of the controversy. Each format is layered to create an interesting yet horrifying glimpse into this family's crisis. This is truly a case in which there are no winners or losers. CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS is a somber look into a devastated family that will continue to affect that viewer long after the film is over. Highly recommended.",1076112000,10,2256,4.970899470899471

1941504,5,B0000SXK0Y,"Although the movie unfolds as a mystery, it is really about the vagaries of memory: how we construct and reconstruct the past.  The Friedmans were a horribly disfunctional family whose head, Arnold, was a paedophile at least to the extent of liking child pornography.  The entire family had many reasons to misremember the events that led, not only to Arnold's downfall, but also to that of his youngest son Jesse.  Nonetheless, it will probably never be clear whether Arnold and Jesse were guilty of the crimes with which they were charged, mainly because of the equally horrible misconduct of the Great Neck police, the prosecutor's office, and the judge in the cases.  All of these public officials are shown repeatedly misbehaving, but later seeming to remember nothing of their misdeeds even when the evidence is entirely clear.  This movie raises very troubling questions about the way we pursue justice in this country.
The two-disk DVD is superb; if you liked the movie, you will be more than pleased with the additional material, which fleshes out the incident and tells what happened to the main characters.  The saddest part, I thought, were the attempts by the public officials (including the judge!) to defend their misconduct during discussions at showings of the film.  That feature alone was worth the price of admission.",1075507200,2,1337,5.05
1941505,4,B0000SXK0Y,"CtF is a great example of a documentary that doesn't take sides. It's very like being a witness to a trial -without- a defense or prosecution present. Facts (as they are known) are displayed, opinions (as such) are presented, and judgments are shown. Perhaps the most interesting aspect here is how ""truth"" is truly subjective.
The matter at hand is - as it needs to be - base and disgusting. This isn't a ""Judge Judy"" special. That the filmmaker came across this story while researching an innocuous (sp?) topic is telling. The insight into legal procedures shows explicitally how the legal systems of most all locations fail (plea bargin, split defence, ""make a deal"").
Eventually, this is a tragic documentary of a tragic family - heartwrenching, honest, simple, and apparently true. It may not be a movie for your DVD collection, but it is a movie everyone should see.",1072569600,4,872,4.859060402684563

1941540,4,B0000SXK0Y,"Enter the Friedmans, a family of five from Great Neck. NY.  Here you have Arnold, a pedophile who has serious arrested sexual development issues and likes to keep a stash of child porn.  There's Elaine, a woman caught in a excruciatingly miserable marriage who can't catch a break or win for losing.  Then there are the Friedman brothers, David, Seth, and Jesse.  The Friedmans seem like a typical upper-class family until the USPS intercept Arnold's child porn magazines from The Netherlands, and from there we see the dynamics of dysfunction before our eyes.

A search warrant is conducted at the Friedman home, and there it is discovered that Arnold teaches children computer classes in his basement.  They also find more child porn, and investigators begin to wonder if Arnold abused any of his students.  The investigation yields information that both Arnold and his son Jesse abused young boys while they taught students.  As the investigation progresses the allegations get more bizarre, with some wondering if the Friedmans are victims of a witch hunt.

Adding to a more sensational story, the Friedman children documented their family nightmare through video and audio footage.  The footage reveals a very maladjusted, abusive bunch of children who turn their anger against the mother and blame HER for their father's sexual deviancy.  Meanwhile, Arnold meekly lets her take the fall.  The footage reveals a family that has been frayed for years, with the family dynamics so disjointed that Arnold becomes one of the children, with their mother being the perpetual scapegoat it all.  Most of the vitriol directed towards Mrs. Friedman is done by David, the bitter clown who even goes so far to say that his own mother's sexual prudence lead to their father being attracted to boys.  The reality was that Arnold really wanted to have sex with children, with his son Jesse allegedly abused by his father.

""Capturing the Friedmans"" attempts to paint an objective picture to let the viewer decide innocence of Arnold and Jesse Friedman.  Unfortunately, the documentary leaves more questions than answers.  It isn't too far of a leap to go from collecting child porn and eventually acting on one's fantasies and impulses by having sex with children.  Child porn doesn't mean guilt, but it certainly doesn't scream innocence, either.  The fact that Jesse told his own attorney that he was abused by his father and that sexual acts did occur between the men and some of the boys, along with both pleading guilty speaks for itself.  To illustrate just how strange this family is one only needs to see the brothers engaging in a jubilee after the sentencing, and Jesse questioning a father of a victim as if he's on TV.

I think we'll never get to the truth of what happened at the Friedman's home, but if footage is any indicator of truth it's pretty convincing.",1418601600,3,2864,4.949790794979079

1941543,5,B0000SXK0Y,"The creators of CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS (2003) did their best to present all sides of this horrendous story and to not take an editorial stance.

Since the family had almost a fetish about taking home movies and videotapes, at times the documentary is like watching the truest, most shocking kind of reality TV.

At one point we learn that the father, Arnold, wrote out his life story for an investigative reporter. He tells of his parents' divorce and how mom, Arnold and younger brother Howard were forced by poverty to live in an apartment of two large rooms, meaning they all shared the same bedroom: the boys over on one side of the room in one bed, the mother in another opposite them

At times, she had men over and Arnold would listen in the dark as they had sex. This activity led to Arnold, a boy of 13, molesting 8-year-old Howard. The brother, who was 65 when this documentary was made in 2003, says he has no memory of ever being improperly touched by Arnold.

So I was left to think that perhaps Arnold's confession was a contrivance, an effort to rescue son Jesse from doing prison time, for it was Jesse who was accused of most of the sexual assaults in his dad's at-home computer classes.

Then, in the last few minutes of the documentary, my opinion of Arnold Friedman did a 180. We see Howard Friedman at home...with his long time male lover. It's an ""ah-ha!"" moment for me that Arnold was really telling the truth about being a pedophile since he was a young teen. That Howard doesn't remember Arnold's misconduct may be a defense mechanism, or he could've been protecting the memory of a brother who committed suicide in prison.

In the WIKIPEDIA article on ""Capturing the Friedmans"" we're brought up to date on Jesse's situation. He was released in 2001 after serving 13 years of an 18 year sentence. Although he confessed in court to dozens of sexual assaults that were committed when he was 18, once jailed Jesse recanted, and has since steadfastly maintained that no pedophilia ever occurred.

A three year investigation by the Nassau Co. District Attorney's office resulted in a 155 page report that concluded, ""By any impartial analysis, the reinvestigation process prompted by Jesse Friedman, his advocates and the Second Circuit, has only increased confidence in the integrity of Jesse Friedman's guilty plea and adjudication as a sex offender.""

The mother, Elaine comes across worst during the family crisis, yet it's clear she believes her husband and youngest son were indeed child molestors and that Arnold was selling kiddie porn. (It was Elaine who convinced Jesse to plead guilty.) Her oldest boy, David, a professional clown, seems in denial, insists the evidence is trumped up and the police are crazy. The middle son, Seth refused to participate in the film, which may indicate he thinks the worst is true, or the whole thing could just be an embarrassment to him. He lives out west somewhere now.

The second DVD contains the most stomach-turning material. We hear at great length from the boy whose testimony ultimately sent both Arnold and Jesse to prison. The things he alleges they did in that classroom are unspeakable, even unthinkable.",1401235200,7,3185,4.8080438756855575

1941587,3,B0000SXK0Y,"Spanning several lives of a family that lived in Great Neck, this film talks about all the events that transpired in their lives and brought the truth out. It is a crime based documentary and seldom are tricks like music used for effects. The Friedmans lived for several years under one roof but at no point in their lives or atleast during their interviews, do they seem like a family. You see they seem to me as though they have been bound in solitary confinement for a majority of their lives. While the first forty minutes reveal the mysteries of the family and the peculiarity of the families therein, the rest of the film goes along spinning many circles in trying to make the viewer understand the grevity of the matter at hand. The film loses the audience's interest towards the last quarter where you wonder how long it has left. This could have been less than one hour forty minutes but then it wouldn't have held any weightage. The end made me tear up, of course and I think it left me with something to mull over despite how long it took to come to its conclusion.

In my conclusion however I would recommend this to anyone who is as curious as me to know just what this five member family went through for several years. The BEAUTIFUL AND SAD thing about CRIME DOCUMENTARIES is that you end up disliking noone but just being astonished at the plight of being human.

1941626,3,B0000SXK0Y,"It is however, compelling viewing. Allegations of sexual abuse are the hardest to either prove or disapprove. A court of law was satisfied that some of the Freidman clan were guilty of the charges laid against them. It is an often stated opinion that law is about legal process and not justice. We assume the documentary maker had information we may not have been able to access through the public domain, such as interviews with key people involved. That is where this documentary fell over for me. I don't know whether the Friedman's were guilty of the crimes they were charged with. That they were eccentric was obvious in the video footage, interviews and there dysfunction family life opened to public gaze. But a few issues stuck in my craw. Their love of pornography and I think child pornography was amongst their seized processions. That in itself is not a victimless crime. And that one of the protagonists said what happened did happen. I think had the documentary maker stuck to their original aim, to let the story tell itself-from all sides. Then we as watchers could have reached our own conclusion. At the end of this, I felt duped by the film maker. Enough to go on line and read through the available material on the case. My conclusion differs from the doco. The protagonists (the accused Friedmans) do not appear to be innocent victims. People who are sexually abused are still all too readily not believed. False accusations although they do occur are not as common as is sometimes stated. But this documentry has over time given me some good discussion with people on the area of sexual abuse. This story needed a brighter, sharper light to see into the corners of the Friedman's world. The documentary fuzzed things, made the eccentric porn loving dad and boys appear basically harmless and a bit obsessive. I am not persuaded of that view.",1350604800,4,1863,4.7708978328173375

I think it's an important film, inasmuch as it's a ground-breaker. Historical events like the Holocaust or events in Iraq (which win all the Oscars lately) are a matter of history. The subject of abuse cannot, in my opinion, be given enough attention. It's an ever-present issue that begs further exposure. Certainly, an unpleasant subject, but the documentary approach seems to be tailor-made.

I had little trouble figuring out that Arnold was not so innocent, but I'm still confused why Jesse chose the fate he endured. Winning so many awards is also confusing, since I didn't have the benefit of a 2nd disc of extras. Perhaps no one will know what really went on, but I think the film is valid for it's content, and there should be more like it.

1941628,3,B0000SXK0Y,"Arnold Friedman was accused of multiple counts of child abuse against boys in his computer class. His son Jesse was also accused. Why did they plead guilty? Because they were, or because it seemed like the best way to deal with the situation?

Told through family movies and interviews, this is the story of how a family can fall apart.

It all started when postal inspectors intercepted child pornography coming from Europe addressed to Arnold. They got a search warrant and found he had a considerable collection of quite explicit child porn. What he also had was a row of computers on tables in the basement, right where the porn was stored, where he taught computer programming to boys. And had some pretty explicit X-rated computer games. The police decided to interview all the computer students, past and present, to determine whether they had been molested. Did the police ask very leading questions, which caused the boys to say that things happened the way the police officers said they had? Apparently. But this does not mean that nothing happened.

We get the story from quite a few different points of view. One very revealing one is the mother, Arnold's wife, who is a shrew. Very shrill, complaining, accusing. She eventually divorced Arnold and remarried.

Two of the three sons, the oldest and the youngest, are very involved in the movie and interviewed on camera. The middle boy, Seth, wanted to stay out of it, and only appears in the old family photos. Arnold's brother is also involved, and his attorney, and Jesse's attorney. During the course of the film, just about everyone changes their mind about what happened, and whether or not justice was served.

I can't see how anyone could believe the outcome was justice, but the questions linger. What really did happen? It's a three-tissue movie, whatever you believe really happened.",1336694400,2,1856,4.916932907348243
1941629,5,B0000SXK0Y,"I remember watching Capturing the Friedmans when it first aired on HBO, and thought it to be a fascinating documentary about the chaos that rocks a community when allegations of sexual abuse come forth. Now, as a psycotherapist and educator, I use the video to showcase how sexual predators and pedophiles are n regular, everyday communities, and the difficulties of dealing with these allegations when there is doubt and confusion within the main characters. Furthermore, the Friedmans is excellent at highlighting how this crime (or allegations of it) are detrimental to a family, tearing it apart and leaving very little for the family to repair itself with.",1322697600,3,661,5.186915887850467
1941630,5,B0000SXK0Y,"... thankfully! The chances of such a collection of home movies and tortured memories ever being exposed to light are smaller than the chances of finding an intact Homo neanderthalis frozen in the permafrost.

This is already an old film, much discussed and reviewed, so I don't feel obligated to summarize it very thoroughly. It depicts the agonies of a family - the Friedmans of Great Neck, NY - when the father is discovered to have a trove of child pornography in his home. That discovery leads to astonishing accusations of active child molestation - hundreds of charges - against the father and one of his three sons. The trials occurred during a period when there were several other reported occurrences of child abuse on more than an individual level, notably in Minnesota and California. The issue of this film, therefore, was more than the guilt or innocence of the father and son; it was the 'justice' of the investigative process and the possibility of a whole community being enraptured in a mass hysteria. Was Arnold Friedman a hideous pedophile? Was his son Jesse the victim of a 'witch hunt'?

The film, one doesn't need a reviewer to declare, raised ambiguity to a highly polished art. That was both its virtue and its vice. It did, and will, provoke intense reactions. Those whose strong feelings that the Friedmans were both guilty were incensed that the film suggested any chance of their having been 'railroaded' by the justice system. Those who were primed to suspect the justice system of failure were fiercely convinced that the film exposed exactly what they feared, a self-righteous witch-hunting mentality. The Friedmans were a complexly dysfunctional family, not Ozzie and Harriet but vividly human, making this film the most emotionally powerful ""reality show"" of all time. If you've read Jean-Jacques Rousseau's ""Confessions"" and wondered how the man could expose his sordid flaws so unabashedly, you'll be pole-axed by the willingness of the Friedmans to allow this exposure of their tragedy, ambiguous or not.

I didn't see the film when it was new. I rented it now because of interest stimulated by the suicide of the respected pediatrician Mel Levine, following astonishing accusations of persistent child abuse over many years. Levine's research and writings were of major significance in education, in the legitimization of concern with ""learning differences"" and attention to differing learning modes among children. My wife, a psychologist, has been effectively a disciple of Mel Levine in her own work; the accusations against him, and his suicide, have naturally been highly upsetting for her. The Friedman tragedy of decades ago is pertinent, whatever the truth of things, to the current tragedy of Mel Levine.

The issue of mass hysteria is pertinent for all time. Accepting that Arnold Friedman was indeed a pedophile, it's still unbelievable, by any standard of logic or evidence, that the majority of the charges against him and his son were true. One would have to believe that boys of 10-14 years of age were stripped naked in groups, sodomized repeatedly and violently during what was supposed to be a computer class in the Friedman home, bloodied in some instances, and then sent smiling out to the cars of parents picking them up, and that this scenario continued on a regular basis for four years!

Mass hysteria has played a documented role in human history, and never a pretty one. There were the Salem witch trials, which have gotten such literary and scholarly attention despite the simple fact that they were nothing extraordinary. There were the recurrent ""blood libels"" against Jewish communities in Europe, and there are still living Americans who maintain that Jews really did systematically kidnap and butcher Christian children to make Passover wafers with their blood.

""Capturing the Friedmans"" is unique, a mass hysteria trapped in amber. How far and how virulently can a mass hysteria spread? I really don't think I want that question answered experientially!",1299974400,3,4025,5.109422492401216
1941631,4,B0000SXK0Y,"This movie is about a pedophile, plain and simple. In my opinion there is no mystery or doubt. I think the director tried to create a sense of doubt about Arnold Friedmans guilt in order to intrigue the audience. I believe all the male characters in this film are homosexual including the Friedman sons. This is not a story about an average american family gone awry, this movie is about a group of homosexuals in Great Neck, New York. I suspect that many of the victims were drawn to the ""computer class"" because they were homosexual as well.

Actually, I thought this movie was intriguing; disgusting but intriguing.",1270684800,2,618,4.722222222222222
1941632,3,B0000SXK0Y,"Capturing the Friedmans: 5 out of 10: Child Molestation, family dysfunction, mass hysteria, homosexuality, and clowns: Where do I sign up.

Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki was making a documentary on the high priced children's clown Silly Billy (David Friedman). A very angry and irrational clown that will play into every clown stereotype you have ever had (Think serial killer). Well it turns out David is the older brother and son of the two men convicted in a famous child molestation case that took place during the witch hunt style child molestation hysteria, of the late eighties.

Could the Friedmans also be victims of same said hysteria? Innocent men railroaded to prison? Well it turns out no. If you're looking for a documentary on the abuse of the justice system, especially in such cases, keep looking. If you want a voyeuristic look inside a upper middle class Jewish family one southern twang away from Jerry Springer, welcome home.

Without the child molestation charges this would be a hilarious romp. Each family member from the angry clown to the screeching mother is a gift that keeps on giving. Using home footage that manages to capture moments that reality television can only dream of, Capturing the Friedmans gives you a ringside seat next to a family simply imploding upon itself.

Unfortunately much of the movie concentrates on the child molestation case at hand. Trying to create suspense and play with the idea that the two men are innocent, the movie sets itself up for a fall. While some of the charges are clearly trumped up (naked group leapfrog?), the father is clearly guilty (and pleads accordingly). The son Jesse, whose case is on shakier ground, doesn't help his own cause by having zero defense witnesses and eventually pleading guilty as well.

Jarecki clearly was playing with the hand he was dealt. And what a hand. He had an incredible collection of home movies fall into his lap. Simply making a film about this family falling apart very well may have worked. But Jarecki overplays his hand attempting to turn it into a documentary about the American judicial system. This overreach simply falls flat.

But in all fairness, if I were looking at spending six months filming Silly Billy the clown I would have grasped for straws too.",1268870400,6,2271,4.9164490861618795

1941635,1,B0000SXK0Y,"Inasmuch as I appreciate documentaries by-and-large, this one took me on a roller-coaster of fascination, confusion, frustration, and ultimately disgust.  ""Doc"" Filmmakers have a tough job IF they are TRULY attempting to be objective....in this case, I don't think the director was honest with the audience.  There are many back-and-forths regarding the ""truth"" and the ""facts"" that could make your head pop, BUT in the end the director chooses to use some sentimental music to almost wax nostalgic over this worn-and-torn sick family.....the Friedmans???!!
How about the two boys he did molest on summer vacation...how about the loads of child pornography found in his home...why weren't there any basic counter-interpretations brought in regarding the almost endless interpretations of the details by sons David and Jesse?? Why was the one snippet of a former computer class student/victim used (which showed him to just lounge on the sofa and be so casual/vague about his responses) when the snippet in the Supplemental Materials (Disc 2) showed him to be quick, clear and strong in his recollections?  Why weren't some fundamental aspects and EFFECTS of emotional/sexual abuse discussed by experts in psychology so as to give us a better understanding why many children COULD HAVE been molested by Arnold and Jesse?
No documentary is perfect, but that's beside the point....even in the extras clips of premiere showings the final result is that more emphasis is placed on challenging the methods of the detectives along with extending more sympathy towards the father and sons RATHER than INCLUDING an equally robust analysis of the pedophile, Arnold Friedman, and his sons.
Is it so hard to call Arnold Friedman what he was AND scrutinize the Law??  Apparently it was too much for the director to give us...which causes me to wonder if he has a potentially dangerous vulnerable spot in his heart for abusers like Mr. Friedman.  Case in Point:  since there was no such ""hard"" challenge to Mr. Friedman displayed in the film, since there was no display of remorse shown in the film by Mr. Friedman for his previous molestations...since there was such defiance shown by David and Jesse...then why the %*#@ would the director offer a link in the DVD-ROM section of Disc 2 to download the Mambo song by Arnold Friedman??!!!  That strikes me as sick (if you want me to spell it out...little disgust and/or outrage is shown towards Mr. Friedman by the director, but we can still enjoy his cute Mambo song, right?  Friedman can traumatize boys, but that doesn't really matter so much....here's a cool song...download it!!).  Andrew Jarecki, check your soul long and hard in the mirror.

1941676,5,B0000SXK0Y,"I always think the mark of a brilliant documentary is the lasting questions it leaves you with.  I want to know all about the surviving Friedmans --- how they are doing? have they found a measure of peace?

I was walking through Costco today and saw a book that was entitled something like how to survive the toughest times.  I started thinking about what the toughest times would be.  I suspect we'd all have different definitions.  Losing your house and all of your money---- that seems more and more present these days, as a possibility.  If you still have your family, your health, your mind, that seems surmountable.  But losing one or more of these other things in addition to tough times imposed from the outside world---THAT is the test of character.

The Friedmans lose their family, and the world brands them as society's worst criminals.  They lose their identity.  They are no longer a nondescript nice little Jewish family from Long Island;  they are child molestors.  Their family falls apart, their health and lives are affected....  The movie shows us how they suffer in this unfathomable agony.  Their characters are not particularly noble and are not up to this challenge.....  I suppose no one's would be.

Compounded on all of it is this overarching sense of injustice.  That they have been singled out to suffer (and in the case of Jesse at least, the youngest son) so unfairly.  While we all feel loss when the economy crashes, there is a certain comfort in knowing we are not alone.  The Friedmans were alone and the tragedy of this ordeal defined their lives.

I want to know how things turned out.  How are they now?

The Farmer's Wife was like this, Lalee's Kin, Living Dolls, and any number of brilliant documentaries---we're left wanting more, and the families whose stories are told want nothing more than to fade away....  It's pure voyeuristic selfishness I know, to want so much more.  If they didn't make me care I wouldn't want to know.  So I guess be forewarned.

1941678,5,B0000SXK0Y,"This documentary film by Andrew Jarecki, founder of Moviefone, is simply one of the best ever made. It does everything a documentary should- ask questions, provide insights, and allow a viewer to draw their own, if differing, conclusions. The film started out as a short film on New York City clowns, following the lifestyle of Silly Billy- played by David Friedman. During the course of filming Jarecki found out that Friedman's brother and father, Jesse and Arnold Friedman, were convicted pedophiles- which makes the viewer wonder about David's chosen profession.
  When I picked up this DVD I thought it was on the 1990s spy case involving the traitor with a Jewish name I forget. Instead, it's about the last big 1980s sex ring pseudo-case- the most famous being the McMartin Daycare case. Like that this case was way overblown and innocents suffered many false accusations. The difference is that at the center of the case was an admitted pedophile- Arnold Friedman, a retired science teacher who taught computer classes from his basement home with his eighteen year old son Jesse. They, and three neighbor boys, were not only charged with sodomy and sexual abuse, but patently ridiculous charges that were typical of the era before False Memory Syndrome was scoped out. On Thanksgiving of 1987, the Friedman home in Great Neck, Long Island, was invaded by a SWAT team, intent on nailing Arnold for buying child pornography through the mail....  The prosecutors are reprehensible- claiming mounds of porno all over the house, while photos taken the moment the cops busted in showed one small hidden stash in Arnold's private room. A female prosecutor contradicts herself many times, her bias is evident, and- ala the OJ Simpson case- while Arnold's guilt for that he was accused of may be wrong, there's little doubt the cops more or less framed him. Yet, Jarecki lets them all prattle on- David, in his belief that, contrary to Arnold's admissions, his father was totally innocent, to Jesse's lawyer- who may be the worst attorney in the nation. All speak with authority- yet those things verifiable undercut almost every assertion. Many of the original accusers now say they lied, under pressure from parents and police- one father of a `victim' admits that police pressured his son. Many of the 107 counts against Arnold and 245 counts against Jesse simply could not have occurred in the time frames claimed, and physical evidence was utterly non-existent. Add to that the fact that pedophiles almost always act alone, for fear of being caught, and the whole bizarreness of that time and place shines through....Capturing The Friedmans is one of those endless Chinese dolls-within-dolls conundra which begs for repeat viewing. One is left hoping that such witch hunts are a thing of the past, but knowing they are not. That you, your child, or a friend, could be the next Jesse Friedman- whether you feel him guilty or not- is a quease that won't leave, and why the film is great art.",1220918400,,2993,4.95816733067729

1941716,5,B0000SXK0Y,"In Adaptation, Robert McKee tells Nicolas Cage's character that the reason he can't write a successful script based on Meryl Streep's character's story, is because she is lying, and a story where the characters don't act truthfully can't work. But Capturing the Friedmans is successful despite the fact that the boys clearly are lying about something. In fact, people can't stop thinking about this film. Jarecki cleverly shows that as characters who lie, the Friedmans act very logically as they assume textbook roles of the codependent family model.

Clearly, the charges they went to prison for were ridiculous and even improbable, but something was up. The father certainly went to great lengths to be a family & community Hero (to hide his Addiction -- he played 2 roles) while the mother Enabled -- I won't say what -- by allowing the three boys and the dad to have a pact, a private club, from which she was excluded. After all, she knew her family wasn't right but she didn't go into his office or question the boys, allowing a strong secret to be kept from her in her own home. So the parents covered three roles - the Addicted, Enabler, and Hero. Next we have David, the Mascot, who immediately puts underwear on his head to distract the media's attention from his father. In the codependent model, a Mascot ""clowns"" around in order to distract attention away from the Addicted member. [He got so good at it, he's now a professional clown] A Mascot is either happy or sad according to whatever will get the most attention. When the underwear tactic didn't work, David went to great lengths to organize a campaign to prove his father was innocent--of these charges, at least. When the mother finally got it together and realized the father was a rat, he got vicious in redirecting the accusations toward her - again, any behavior that will distract attention from the Addicted/Dependent member. But his act is thin, because it turns out the father hid the child porn magazines where the boys would find them, but not her -- in his office and among the music in the piano bench. Being the main pianist among the boys, David must've looked through the music in the piano bench. So why did he defend his father? Jesse, the Scapegoat, took the negative attention by association and like a true Scapegoat, seems proud of it - winking at the camera when he says he will go to court and ""abandon father."" Also, in the car on the way to the sentencing, when David confronts him, asking if any of it happened during the computer classes, Jesse says no - but then his eyes change as he says nothing that HE saw, anyway. Seth, who declined to be a part of the film, seems to be the Lost Child (although I can't say for sure).

That's all the characters in the codependent family model. Wow. Looks textbook to me. So, Friedmans, notwithstanding the fact that you were clearly unfairly put in jail without a fair investigation or trial (and no doubt the prosecutors will suffer karmic consequences for that eventually), out with it - I don't want to say what I think you're lying about.

1941717,5,B0000SXK0Y,"An utterly fascinating look at the crash and burn of an American family.

The father, Arnie Friedman, was witness to his mother's inappropriate and self-serving sexual activity; unsurprisingly, he turns out to be a pedophile whose penchant for buying kiddie mags gets him investigaged for child rape.  His wife, Elaine, who looks like the years with Arnie has sucked the life out of her, walks around in a fog, totally bewildered that a)she married such a creepy little freak and b)her three boys prefers dad to her.  Oldest son Dave is in his own state of denial about his father's problems and blames it all on mom.  The most sympathetic figure is youngest boy Jesse, who was imprisoned for 13 years for a most unsympathetic crime.

Did Arnie and Jesse rape those little boys?  The interviewed accuser comes across as less than credible - he contradicts himself, can't remember the first episode of molestation (though remembers plenty else) and when asked to explain an important detail, hesitates as though he were thinking ""what the heck do I say now?""  The Feds appear to have been caught up in the same hysteria that got a bunch of innocent day care providers tossed in prison in the 1980s - they used interview techniques that were more like criminal interrogations and hypnosis (reknown for inducing false memories.)  Way to manipulate and damage little kids, you dumb cops.

In any case, Arnie is a self-admitted pedophile and his taste for child porn victimizes his whole family, especially Jesse (possibly in more ways than one.)  Despite this, his boys absolutely adore him.  It's hard to understand why - on their home movies, dad comes across as an emotional dud, with a flat affect and a distant stare.  The most animated he gets is when he pounds out ""I'm In Heaven"" on the piano the night before he goes to prison.  The oldest son David is especially an apologist for Arnie.  He implies that if Elaine had not been such a cold fish Arnie wouldn't have been in the predicament he ended up in.  You just want to slap Dave around with the facts of life:  ""David!  Wake up!  Your parents didn't have sex because DADDY likes LITTLE BOYS!""

1941719,5,B0000SXK0Y,"There's not enough good I can say about this film. It is fascinating on so many levels.

Filmmaker Andrew Jarecki's original idea -- to film New York City birthday clowns -- took a new tack when he met #1 clown David Friedman, who had a family secret infinitely more intriguing than his birthday work. It turns out that David's father was an infamous Long Island pedophile whose story had rocked the small town of Great Neck in the late 1980s.

The film is a chronicle of the Friedman's story, from the days before the scandal until the present. Father Arnold Friedman is a beloved high school teacher who teaches piano and computer skills at his home. After police catch him with a few kiddie porn magazines, they start interviewing Friedman's students. Suddenly, Friedman and his teenage son Jesse are being charged with hundreds of incidents of sodomy and assault, and their lives are turned upside down. Luckily (from the point of view of the filmmakers) the family had always loved taking films of themselves and did not stop during the family crisis. Much of the family's film and video footage appears in the movie, either reinforcing or acting as counterpoint to the interviews they accompany.

But ""Capturing the Friedmans"" is about much more than a pedophilia scandal. It is also about the way that the structure of the justice system -- police, lawyers, judges and legal procedures -- can sometimes generate convictions from nothing. The film is also about memory, specifically the way our memories are reshaped by the passing years. Research is now demonstrating that memories -- rather than being videotapes of the past -- are strongly colored by the way we see ourselves in the present. In the film, the juxtaposition of present day ""recollections"" with the written and filmed record is staggering.

The filmmakers are not trying to exonerate the Friedmans or to indict those who brought them to justice. The facts are laid out with all their gaps and contradictions; the characters are allowed to tell their own stories with all their factual and self-serving facets. And we are asked to respond. Are the Friedmans victims, merely odd or truly evil? How did a community come to believe what seems to be a bizarre story? How did the legal system reach a verdict without adequate investigation by skeptical police or a trial before the peers of the accused? Was justice served -- or merely the justice system?

The 2-disk DVD includes Jarecki's interview on the Charlie Rose Show as well as interesting material taken during Q&A sessions at the film's premiers. The film's participants react to the way they are depicted -- usually continuing to make the case for decisions made 15 years in the past -- sometimes escalating into confrontations and raw anger.

In short, ""Capturing the Friedmans"" is a movie that I cannot stop talking about and recommending to everyone I meet.",1150329600,8,2889,4.909836065573771
1941720,5,B0000SXK0Y,"Hands down one of the best documentaries ever made.  As you can see from the variety of reactions here, it is a film that engages the audience despite its incredibly controversial nature.

I'm amazed at how split the responses are with regards to the guilt of Arnold and Jessie Friedman (specifically the crimes they were accused of together), and even more surprised by the sympathy expressed towards the mother, Elaine.  Regardless of whether her husband and son were actually guilty (and for the record, the accusations are HIGHLY implausible and the evidence non-existent), her behavior was selfish and atrocious.  I'm sure she was experiencing her own turmoil and thought she was doing the right thing, but it is astounding to see a woman with such a poor sense of familial commitment claim righteousness over the others.  Especially considering her choices in starting this family.

In fact, it is this destruction of the family dynamic that makes the piece so compelling.  Seeing it disolve firsthand, via the home videos made by the Friedmans, is absolutely fascinating.

Provided you can stomach the graphic and frank discussion about pedophilia, this documentary is fantastic.",1149811200,3,1186,5.205263157894737
1941721,4,B0000SXK0Y,"Because there is no evidence to prove either way. The fact that 2 long prison sentences were still the result of all this is shocking. If I were innocent of a crime I did not commit (especially one as horrible as this), I would NEVER give in and plead guilty just to bargain with the judge. I have no respect for Jesse Friedman in this regard.

Let me make it clearer. Andrew Jarecki was just making a documentary about New York Clowns when he met David Friedman, the best party clown in New York. David told him of his past and provided Jarecki with hundreds of reels of family home-movie footage. The Friedmans captured every moment of their lives on film it would seem. The story that unfolded in these films was something Jarecki could never even dream of.

Arnold Friedman was a troubled man. After the death of his 9-year-old big sister his father left and the family was torn apart. His mother moved into a tiny apartment with him and his brother and all three of them shared a room. The mother would bring back male partners and shag them in full view/earshot of her sons. Wouldn't that disturb you? But it gets even worse. He was a merry man, slightly camp and married a woman who was as about as sexually responsive to him as a blow-up doll. They may have had three sons and lived a 'happy' existence as an upper-middle class Jewish family in a well-to-do part of the state, but underneath it all Arnold was hiding a secret. He was a huge paedophile and he liked really young boys.

He would order kiddie fiddling mags from Europe, but one of them was seized by customs and he was investigated. Arnold also taught computer class and the cops made a list of all the names of the kids he taught and made a point of interviewing them with some truly dodgy, unclear, unprofessional techniques.

Many of the kids said that Arnold and his oldest son Jesse had been sexually abusing them. And not a simple one-at-a-time deal either. Apparently they had made them all strip naked in class and play a horrible game called 'leap frog' in which each and everyone of them would quickly and systematically be anally raped. Is this disgusting? Of course it is? Do I believe it? No! There is no way that this could have continued for as long as it did without someone noticing. Other kids in the same class said nothing like it ever occurred. And if it did then where is the evidence? Without meaning to sound crude, anal sex is a pretty difficult thing to get right as an adult. For terrified, unwilling children who are being mass-raped where was the tissue damage, the blood, the tears, the agony and the reluctance to ever go back to Mr Friedman's class? Even for adults it's not simply like sticking a hot dog through a donut. This whole allegation that they did anal-rape as a game of leap frog is absurd and totally far-fetched.

Did Arnold Friedman have wicked thoughts about his students? Probably. Did he involve his then 18-year-old son? Hmmm, I'm not sure about that one. Let me just say that the Friedman household is one I am glad I am not part of. There always seems to be an atmosphere of unnaturalness or 'something ain't quite right here' about it. Jesse Friedman says that his dad never hurt him. Jesse Friedman's Defence Attoney says otherwise.

This is a particular trick Jarecki uses to show the conflicting sides of the story. One person says black and immediately another person says white. The documentary is nothing but contradicting stories and polar opposites. While I do not believe the entire innocence of Arnold Friedman (the man clearly WAS a paedophile), I do NOT believe the word of the Cops, the FBI or any other authority interviewed.

The Judge, one Abbey Boklan, said she was sure of Arnold Friedman's guilt the second she saw him. In my view, she's openly admitting to Gross Professional Misconuct. How dare she, a judge, a stern, responsible authority figure, make such an outrageous, unfounded remark without hearing ANY kind of evidence first.

And like I said, there IS no evidence. Only the claims of the children. Nothing in this case was based on evidence because evidence didn't exist. Doesn't that strike you as being really, really odd? The Cops claimed that hypnosis was used to get answers out of the kids. As well as pressure from the parents (oblivious to the fact that their kids are undamaged physically) to tell the proverbial awful truth and encouraging embellishment of perhaps slight truths and instances to the point where this whole ridiculous leap frog game is created.

The trial is not the only focus of the film. The complete and utter breakdown of the family is also caught on camera. The sons hate their mother with a passion at her refusal to stand by her man. I can understand their anger, but what woman would? She had no evidence to persuade her either way, but she always found an unnaturalness to Arnold and the allegations probably confirmed her fears I guess.

Arnold killed himself in prison in 1995 so Jesse, also imprisoned for 13 years despite no evidence, could benefit from the $250, 000 insurance policy. Mrs Friedman re-married but the family name is stained forever in my opinion. So too should be the word of all the unprofessional authorities and lawyers involved.

No one in this documentary comes away without tarnish. It's a sick, sad and sorry story that will confuse as much as it enlightens. Make up your own mind.",1139702400,17,5401,4.633228840125392

The dvd comes with an extra disc, containing lots of additional footage, facts, information and updates.

What Jarecki uncovered, however, was the sad, secret, mysterious tale of David's father and youngest brother. To their friends and neighbors in Great Neck, an affluent New York suburb, the Friedmans were a model family-until one Thanksgiving Day when Arnold Friedman, a former musician and award-winning teacher, and his youngest son, Jesse, were accused of child molestation. The resulting investigation and trial exposed a bizarre criminal case where the facts were neither as simple nor as clear-cut as they initially seemed. The Friedmans compulsively filmed and videotaped themselves during happy times, and, strangely, this practice wasn't curtailed after the arrests. Much of CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS consists of this family footage, and while you have to question their rationale behind shooting these intimate moments, there's no denying that they're what give this documentary its emotional power. What is the nature of truth? CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS will make you ponder that question long after you've seen it. A bizarre, disturbing, and compelling experience.",1132358400,4,1176,5.649717514124294
1941724,5,B0000SXK0Y,"I'll be as upfront as this documentary filmmaker was in his story telling: I'm a survivor of eleven years of sexual abuse at the hands of my father. My 3 siblings also were abused as were other children. How do I know? Besides them telling me, I often witnessed the incidents. Not all serio-peodophiles are the stuff of witch-hunt hysteria, but trust me they'd sure like you to believe that was the case.

I state that now because the filmmaker gives the audience the most important information first as well: this father Friedman, he loved his child porn. You don't need to be Sherlock to figure out what comes next.

Or maybe you do. I didn't because being up close and personal with a molester for the first 15 years of my life, I have a radar for such things.

I had heard about this supposedly controversial movie for a while now but did not seek it out. I just happened tonight to come upon it on a specialty movie channel here in Canada.

I think this documentary is a movie first, documentary second using real life persons - some of whom can act better then others. Hmm. Art imitating life?

And what a window it is into the life of one peodophile's family.

As soon as we discover father Friedman has ordered one child porn mag, you have to be pretty nave to believe it was his first. And yes, we soon learn he had a stack of kiddie mags. Then, as you discover this award-winning teacher gets excited about little boys, who couldn't put two and two together and think he just might be a risk to his students and had been to his 3 sons? Oh, we do learn he only did ""one kid."" Then it's two. But they weren't his students. Earlier it was only one mag and no children. Oh really? One or two -- they were somebody's children!

What parent wouldn't have alarm bells go off when they discover their teacher is REALLY into their kids? The hysteria that ensues I would think would be less criminal than the fact that this teacher has kiddie porn, has molested and might molest one or more of these students.

Watching this film is like watching a window into an episode of my family soap-opera. The mother is cast as the villain; the father is the talented victim/""peodophile, yes, but he didn't do his students!""; the three sons are the entertaining drama-making by-standers.

In my family there were also 3 sons, but with a sister. Our mother was nave, yet devoted; our father, unlike father Friedman was not lovable or quiet, but was when it came to anything to do with our abuse. Over 30 people found out about our abuse and his silent admission had him sail through unscathed until I finally went to a detective in 1981 when I was 20!! [our family story can be found in Father's Touch here on Amazon.com]

Capturing The Friedmans is a horror movie. The quiet father who loved kiddie porn and molested by his own admittance at the very least two kids is completely responsible for the travesty that befalls his family and community. The ""evidence"" as portrayed in the film leads the viewer to believe that witch-hunt hysteria of the community destroyed one peodophile's family.

While it is a travesty that anyone (investigators and or/parents) would mislead children to wrongly testify, a devil's advocate could suggest that the community's reaction opened pandora's box. Did the community have the right to know their student's teacher loved child pornography and had a sexual interest in children?

Again, what amazes me is that people can state, ""only two kids"".

The ""one"" neighbourhood boy my father molested in my presence ""only one time"", I happened to report to police a decade after the incident. I met this brave now man who supported us, years after the incident, at the preliminary hearing. It took all his strength to come forward, be at the court house, be in the presence of his one-time molester. He looked like the raped young soul of a decade earlier.

No, there is no such a thing as just one incident, one victim. Once is too much!

Capturing The Friedmans suggests that a village destroyed one boy in particular [the youngest son was co-accused with the Father of molesting several students, and in a plea-bargain to avoid possible life-time incarceration, admitted his father had molested him]. This is one case where the sins of the father fell on the son and if this film leaves a viewer with the notion that anyone or anything was the primary destroyer other that the peodophile father, then I'd re-catergorize it as fantasy - documentary.",1130630400,8,4471,4.620428751576292
1941725,4,B0000SXK0Y,"This documentary is a great mix between interviews with people involved and the home movies they shot.

It is mostly about father Friedman who appears to be an outstanding member of society who teaches computer to children. But as the story goes on you get to know more and your opinion starts to change somewhat. He orders a childporn mag and they arrest him for that. Then people start saying he also molests and rapes them.

During the movie you are never quite sure if he (and also his youngest son) did it or not. The details are getting more lurid but you never are quite sure who you should believe or not. Apparently movie theaters complained that people stayed after the movie to discuss this very thing.

Even though this movie is for all ages it really is 16+ in its content. For people concerned with childrens pornography and child molestation it will also be a good look in the minds of people concerned. How people deny or even forget things about it.

1941757,5,B0000SXK0Y,"The Twilight Zone - Great Neck New York -1988

You are about to enter the Twilight Zone. A middle-aged computer teacher is caught by a postal inspector with kiddy porn, and is accused of molesting young boys in his classes.  He copes a plea and is sent to jail as a child molester for 10 to 30 years. He commits suicide in jail so that his branded son can at least collect the life insurance to live on.  His 18-year-old son is also accused of the crimes and does 13 years.

No tangible evidence is found of the alleged attacks. The teacher has been teaching computer skills and giving piano lessons for years in Great Neck, an affluent community where no one in the community has ever filed any complaints against the teacher or his son.

An ambitious detective in charge of the Sex Crimes Unit sends out detectives to prove that something must have been going on there.  The over zealous detectives make many visits to children who attended the classes and get confessions from some that they were molested. It was found that the visits extended for as much as 15 times for one child. The parents were never allowed to be present at the interviews.  Interview techniques included threats, favors, and scare tactics.

This information solicits guilty pleas from the father and son, or else they could spend the rest of their lives in jail. The Judge tells the defense attorney that if the son's case goes to trial and he is convicted she will give consecutive sentences for each count. The townspeople or at least the parents of the alleged victims are up in arms. The trial would be held locally, so the father and son were between a rock and a hard place.

The Judge is a friend of the detective in charge of the Sex Crimes Unit, whose husband just happens also to be a judge in the county. The Judge agrees to appear in the movie about the case and states that  ""there was never a doubt in my mind as to guilt"". The Judge and the Sex Crimes head both go to the opening of the movie in Manhattan.

This is a tale of ambition, incompetence, vanity, ignorance, and just plain bad luck.  Beware. It will haunt you.

I'm in the middle of watching the bonus disc features as I type.  It was a well crafted presentation allowing the audience to think like a jury and reach their own decisions.  This family is certainly not lovable, but the forces of law and order arrayed against them were foaming at the mouth to force a trial.  It uses the Friedman family home movies interchangably with news footage and the film maker's interviews.  Arnold Friedman had some glaring shortcomings, but the prosecution at the center of this tale does nothing to address them.  The impression I got of this hamlet, Great Neck Long Island, suggested the term ""witch-hunt"" in my head over and over.  I challenge anyone to watch this and not be put in mind of those innocent souls hanged 400 years ago in Salem, Massachusettes.

As a documentary, this is very commendable.  Most people who enjoyed it as I did would rate it five stars.  It could easily be five stars, too.  I'm very picky-- one has to leave room to rate a film that eclipses it higher.",1125446400,,1134,4.532019704433497
1941759,5,B0000SXK0Y,"I'll admit that the subject matter of this movie--a family ripped apart by allegations of a child molestation ring in the 1980's--didn't make me want to run out and watch it.  A friend kept hounding me to see it, so I finally did, and I was instantly captivated.  This is a spellbinding movie, and it raises so many questions on both sides of the issue that you'll find yourself questioning everything.  The tale spun by the police is over-the-top and involves so many people that it is hard to get 100% behind it, there's enough evidence on the other side that makes you wonder if something did happen.

This case never went to trial.  Both suspects pled guilty and took plea bargains.  The filmmaker said that in the process of making the movie, over and over, he heard detailed accounts of situations from people who hadn't been there and had only heard things third- and fourth-hand.  At that point, he decided not to repeat anything from people who weren't in a situation, but only to present evidence as he found it.  Since there was no trial, he wanted to present all the evidence to his audience and let them serve as a jury.  He may have a slight bias against the police, but there is definitely some evidence of shoddy policemenship, so I can see where that comes from.  For the most part, I thought this was a fair treatment, and I couldn't make up my mind which side was right.  I think the truth lies somewhere between the two extremes.

I don't usually watch the bonus material, but if you enjoy this film, the bonus DVD is an absolute must-see.  It brought up even more information.  At the screenings, there is a fascinating statement from the judge, an argument between the police and the investigative reporter, brother David gets caught in a lie about Jesse's attorney Peter Panaro, and you learn that Jesse admitted guilt on the Geraldo AFTER he was out of prison.  The bonus footage fleshes the story out, gives you more information, and raises even more questions.  The bonus footage is where the questionable policework really comes to light, and I'm glad the filmmaker didn't make too huge a deal about that in the real film, because he would have come off looking like a hotshot if he had.

This is an amazing film that you will keep turning over and over in your mind.",1121040000,,2294,4.569682151589242
1941760,5,B0000SXK0Y,"""Capturing the Friedmans"" is a brilliant piece of moviemaking by director Andrew Jarecki.  It's edited in such a way that once you think you you can pass judgment on the case, new facts are introduced that will blow up your theory and perplex you to no end.  In fact, Jarecki may have done his job too well.  He thought he was making a film that demonstrated that the Friedmans had been railroaded.  Instead, in pollings after some early screenings, Jarecki and his producers were stunned to see that the audience was split 50-50 on it.

The DVD release is contains an impressive assortment of additional information - over two hours worth - that let you drill deeper into the case.  Especially riveting are a confrontation at the movie's premiere and an interview with Charlie Rose.  Surprisingly, Rose never brings up what I see as an interesting aside:  Jarecki is the multimillionaire founder of Moviefone, allowing him the security to spend three years researching and piecing together the film.  In fact, the tale about how Jarecki stumbled into the subject matter is sure to go down in movie history:  he started with a short film (""Funny and Silly"") about NYC birthday party clowns.  The town's Number 1 clown?  None other than eldest son David Friedman.  Slowly, the hidden story spills into Jarecki's lap.  He has almost no choice to run with it.",1120521600,,1356,4.813852813852814
1941761,5,B0000SXK0Y,"That the film ""Carpturing The Friedmans"" even exists is a miracle of sorts.  It's a miracle because this documentary gets 99% of its weight from the actual home footage shot by the family over the course of several decades, including the tumultuous stretch of time in which the family begins to crumble under the weight of serious criminal charges leveled against two family members.

If you aren't familiar with the subject matter of CTF, buckle up.  It deals with the dark and dirty issues of pedophilia/ molestation at the peak of national hysteria in the mid to late 1980's in America.  A trusted and well educated citizen of Great Neck, NY stands accused of posession of child porn and committing sex crimes against children.  He is a husband and father of three boys, a respected teacher, an accomplished musician and respected member of the community.

CTF works for a number of reasons.  But it works mainly because we are treated to an unprecedented insider's view of the subjects.  Despite that, we are never quite sure what is true and what isn't.  Nothing about this horrific story is cut and dried.  Various events and circumstances are described from the perspectives of people both in and out of the family and each version has a different spin.  As such, we are torn as to whom to believe.  We think we know who to hate as the story begins, but it becomes clear that there are very few absolutes to cling to in the Friedman's tale.  On one hand there is damning evidence that Arnold Friedman has indeed been involved in some manner of deviant and illegal behavior.  But does that prove that the things he is accused of really happened?  Some of the victims' claims are quite gruesome and ludicrously high in number.  It becomes difficult to fathom at some point that such abuse could go on with so many children for so long without consequence.  Given the era in which the events occur, one naturally wonders if the police and legal system are perhaps being overzealous and are ""coaching"" children to say what they want to hear.

Then there is the double jeopardy of seeing Arnold Friedman's son Jesse face charges for partaking in the same acts of which his father is accused.  He denies guilt and we want to believe him.  At the very least this boy is an indirect victim himself of his father's apparent fetishes.  At the worst he is a direct victim and commands sympathy even if he did assist his father in these supposed crimes.

Arnold Friedman, always a film/camera buff filtered that interest down to his sons.  As such the family is chronicled in much detail throughout its history.  No portion of that history is more fascinating and compelling however, than the period just after Arnold and Jesse are charged with the aforementioned sex crimes.  Nothing is left out.  We are privy to family arguments that point to gross dysfunction as well as some happy if not odd moments shared between the Friedman's.  All are caught on tape with a sort of honesty and realism that could never be recreated or written.  Ultimately, CTF transcends most other docs because it provides something virtually no other documentary can; a fly on the wall perspective from the inside as the events occur.  CTF is a fascinating and at times chilling watch that will undoubtedly have you talking about it long after the credits roll.",1119398400,3,3335,4.731369150779896

Or on the other side, that admitted pedophile Arnold Friedmam who had a preference for young boys,  was able to have 3 adolescent sons and teach a computer class of adolescent boys with out ever touching one of them.

Capturing the Friedmans conveys much of the complexity and alienation that takes place within a selected few dysfunctional families.  There are practically no characters in this story that the viewer can admire, but this makes the tragedy all the more immense and unforgettable.  The film's direction is flawless as the audience has no idea who to believe. Both the prosecution and defense sides are presented with equal weight and vigor.

Tragically, this type of injustice is not at all uncommon in the U.S. today.  It begins with cops who ""just know"" the defendant is guilty, prosecutors who are overworked and deal with the guilty 99% of the time and can't really investigate each case, judges who believe anything the police say, and finally, the public who are more than ready to believe the worst in everyone.  The hysteria surrounding molestation cases assures that any defendant so charged will be convicted.  I have seen it first hand too many times.  As a film, ""Capturing. ."" presents an editing task of monumenatl proportions.  It is chilling to see a family destruct before your eyes.

The sons, who worship thier father, get caught up in the scandal and, ultimately, pay for the father's sins.  The mother abandons the family, shocked over the relevation and willing to believe the worst of her husband.  I recommend the DVD with a fascinating extra which brings the principals together, including the judge, for the screening.

Every documentarian chooses to include some things and cut others--that in itself is a kind of bias. What I found disturbing about ""Friedmans"" was the author's seemingly reflexive distrust of the accusers and police and his obvious sympathy with an admitted pedophile and his clearly disturbed son. Any sympathy for the victims does not come across at all, and Jarecki seems to go out of his way to include material casting doubt on the accusations.

In ""Capturing the Friedmans"" we are introduced to Arnold Friedman, convicted child molester, and he comes across as a nebbish, congenial, albeit self-loathing man who seems to love his children as much as he hates himself for his pedophile tendencies. His three sons, who adore him, defend their father, who they believe without a shadow of a doubt is innocent (even when faced with his own admissions that he has, in fact, molested boys before) to the bitter end. Mrs. Friedman, who I think I'm in the minority for feeling sympathy for, is a dutiful, if somewhat cold, wife and mother who either had no idea her husband was a pedophile or was in extreme denial about it. Tragically, she finds herself the pariah of the family after her husband's arrest, due to her ambivalence about his guilt.

I love it when a film leaves you with more questions than answers, and ""Capturing the Friedmans"" does just that. By the end of the film, you're left with absolutely no clear answers about exactly how much child abuse Arnold Friedman (or his son Jesse) actually perpetrated. All you're left with is profound sympathy for a family completely shattered.",1095638400,8,1642,4.924187725631769
1941820,3,B0000SXK0Y,"Let's see.  I'm a documentary maker.  I find a family full of pedophiles and Jewish angst.  There's a child porn scandal and then revelations of wild child orgies in a nice middle-class Long Island neighborhood.  Sure, you can get the court shots of the defendants and a few minutes of film of them behind bars, but what about their lives.  Where's the photographic record that shows us what these wacky but lovable perverts are like.  In the case of the Friedman's, NO PROBLEM?  They took super 8 movies and video of everything they ever did with interviews.

In the 1980's child sex crimes became the rage.  Once a poor slob, a teen baby sitter, or a little old lady were accused, they got a show trial and thirty years in the slammer.  By the time the trial was over every kid in town swore they played butt leap with Arnold Friedman and his youngest son, Jesse.  They really had no chance.  Sure, Arnold was a pervert, but somehow, you felt sorry for him in a King Lear way when this great documentary was over.",1093824000,7,1015,4.456521739130435
1941821,5,B0000SXK0Y,"First of all, as most have pointed out, you will probably not see something like this in your lifetime again. Here the Friedman family, during recreational video sessions, captured a horrible series of events that eventually led to one of the biggest child abuse scandals in American history. The documentary cuts between home footage moments, (some of which show the family falling apart at the seams and in particular turning on their mother in many of such family clashes) and recent interviews with the cast, including the cops, lawyers and some of the molested who where involved in the case.

First of all you should know some things about this documentary. Arnold Friedman, a school teacher who held computer classes for children in his home, was clearly involved in pedophilia and had molested children by his own admission on more than one occasion (he actually confessed to abusing most of his computer class but also two boys of a friend he had met some time ago). Basically Arnold had previous sexual problems in his youth and after spending time with a psychiatrist found he could no longer cope with his life except to obtain child pornography from Europe for his release. One of his packages was intercepted by the feds who then proceeded to see if he would send them some magazines (and he did) and so raided his home and found Arnold's secret hidden stash. Seems like a clear cut case of child abuse, right? ... but it ain't.

The police involved in the investigation started to interview children who had attended Arnold's computer class. There was obviously pressure applied to the children to make-up stories, including a shocking interview with a former student who is caught clearly in a lie in front of the camera. The documentary also reveals that the police had used poor tactics to get the children to confess with statements like - If you do not tell us what happened then you will be a homosexual forever... or putting some students under hypnosis to find out what went on during Friedman's computer class... and this is really what is at the heart of the story.

Some children, now older, say that Arnold did absolutely nothing sexual in class except for teaching very boring standard computer lessons, and others who say that he practically ran Hell in there. However many of the students kept coming back to the class and their parents did not notice a thing wrong with their kids. Also video tapes that the students say Arnold made of them where never recovered.... but there is more... when the students started to confess they also implicated Arnold's son, Jesse Friedman, in the attacks - so Jesse got into trouble as well and then.... you have to see the rest. The events off-camera in the Court room where some of the parents encounter Jesse is some of the most remarkable, if not the most remarkable, SOUND ever captured on film, and for that alone is worth viewing (you can see a part of this sequence at the end of the trailer).

There are also some neat little twists in the end that really bend what you thought about some of Arnold's more immediate family - a very tough choice weighs heavily on your mind when it comes, but in many ways it is a case of psychology vs. narrow-mindedness. In fact most of us would probably see it as definitive evidence of something... yet maybe that is what all those who lived in Arnold's community also saw?

Many of the questions poised in CD1 are answered in CD 2, which is really the gem of the box. It is like a Part II. Here you will learn more about the case including the important detail that Arnold confessed to the police that he had molested large segments of student in his home so that he could cut a deal on only molesting three or four (something his family says he did over his guilt about the relationship he had with two boys a long time ago). This confession was leaked and handed out to all the parents who where on the list. Even if their child had denied abuse this was the clincher that caused many parents simply to hook up with the clan and get rid of this problem before it dragged out even longer. Arnold's lawyers did not know this at the time.

As a final note, none of the children ever complained about Friedman attacking them before they where pressed further over a period of several intensive interviews that lasted months. Other individuals where also implicated in the crimes but where never brought to trial. Under case analysis Arnold should have walked like O.J because of the way the case was handled and Jesse certainly should get a retrial but in the end Arnold was one stupid man to be anywhere near children with the problems that he had in not exactly the most innocent situations that one can find themselves in when charged with these crimes. In the end though you could ask yourself one question... would you allow Arnold to hang around your kids? The answer to that question is most definitely NO. However did Arnold abuse all the kids in the way that they described in his home during computer classes? Probably not, but he did abuse two other boys elsewhere. Basically the documentary ends like a guy getting busted for a bigger crime that they probably didn't commit but may have committed a similar crime on a smaller scale some time ago and got away that one. Jesse was just the cherry on the cop's mass abuse hysteria cake. In reality I would also be afraid to let any of those cops near my children. In this documentary there are clearly students, now much older, who where not abused, still believing that they where abused in some horrible fantasies that clearly defy belief and logic.

1941823,4,B0000SXK0Y,"Only in Hollywood can Roman Polansky receive an Oscar for best director and a father and son molestation team can be called quote: loveable. The eerily recorded home movies of the Friedmans allow us to see the truth more from the unspoken evidence than from the families farcical testimony. Jesse and David's inconsistencies and fierce identification and defense of their father are telltale signs of incestual abuse. The two sons also exhibit a pathological denial: David violently denies a confession of molestation written by his father from jail; Jesse dances around, sings, and would quote, rather not think about it. Additionally, the issolation of the mother is typical in both homosexual and heterosexual child incest cases. A power struggle insues when physical attention is taken away from the mother and given to the children--most of the time the mother becomes a ghost or a shell as in this case. Subconsciously the wife knows, but the conscious denial forces her to split or fissure herself in order to cope and ""keep the family together"". Elaine aludes to this when mentioning her mind seeing things, but seeing through them, denying their existence. Jesse, though, should have been placed in a hospital due to the fact that he clearly never had the opportunity to establish a true right from wrong.

 Michael Jackson calls society the ignorant ones for misunderstanding his perversion and it appears that the Friedman's would have us believe the same thing. No matter if this behavior was taught or spontaneous, it is depraved. The tendency to pass this sickness onto others is something I would want to try to understand ONLY to stop it dead in its tracks. To rob an innocent human of their childhood and their future is akin to murder. Molestation psychologically wounds and often perverts for LIFE. Those who support Arnold and Jesse may be doing so in order to deny the vileness of their own lives and actions. The saddest part of this story is that it is happenning in every city in every country and 99% are not caught. They are doing it to their daughters, their sons, their neices, their childrens' friends, their students, and the players on the team they coach.

1941824,5,B0000SXK0Y,"The best documentary to be released in recent years (that includes ""Farenheit 9/11""), ""Capturing The Friedmans"" is a powerful, shocking, disturbing, mesmerizing, sad, & ultimately tragic film that haunts you long after the film is over.
Arnold Friedman is an upstanding teacher, who has garnered many awards in his field, a father to three sons, and the head of a seemingly happy family and household, who also teaches piano & computer lessons to young children & teenagers in Great Neck, NY. When he is arrested & brought up on charges of pediphilia, The Friedman family's normal life descends into a nightmarish hell as family members take sides as to whether Arnold is guilty or innocent (the mother, Elaine, despises Arnold keeping his dark secret from her for all these years, while the boys stand behind there dad). The police, obsessed with bringing the elder Friedman to justice, interview all the children that attended the piano & computer classes, and some not all (and under the coaxing of the police and, worst yet, through hypnosis) admit to some form of pediphiliac action taken against them. It gets worse when during some of the interviews Friedman's youngest son, Jesse, pops up supposedly helping his father in some of the acts. The police promptly arrest Jesse and bring him up on charges, also. The media, of course, does not help matters when accusations & allegations are blown out of proportion as the family, as a whole, disintegrates quickly. The outcome is mind blowing to say the least & a great misjustice to a family that should have gotten a fair trial.
Through video, taken by the Friedman's oldest son to document the entire tragedy in hopes of people seeing the true side of this case, & stock footage of the family in happier times, the viewer is hurled into a video collage of a family that once might have been a stand out in the community to a family that is all but a memory housed on VHS tapes, 8mm film & long forgotten photos. The family's demise is a tragic & sad feeling. I got a small knot in my stomach watching this film.
The final question still remains - who is to blame?
There are three factors.
first off, Arnold Friedman because even though he was into pediphilia, he should have had the responsibility to put him being a father figure & teacher first & foremost over anything else, including his secret stash of kiddie porn. Didn't he realize that if he got caught w/ this trash he was looking at jail time? As for his son Jesse, he should have pleaded innocent. The trial may have lasted a few more years, but, in the long run he would have been, possibly, an innocent man.
The police & the Feds should have had a lot more restraint & over all, discreet class over this case. For the case to turn into a circus and free for all is a shame & to grill the children the way they did during the interview, and coming up with no substantial evidence other than the stack of hidden kiddie porn is the classic paranoid case of going above the law & also a classic case of mis-justice (the bonus materials on the second disc are not to be missed).
The parents of the so called victims. After the case broke, in the media and the surrounding area, the parents got together to console one another & attend group therapy. But, how can the children be called victims, when those same parents would pick there son or daughter from whatever class they attended with no bruises, physical scarring of any kind, no tears shed and clothes that were unsoiled and untorn? Even with that said, wouldn't the child come forward to the parent saying that he or she didn't want to go to the class anymore? One of the kids that confessed to being abused & was hypnotized, comes off on screen like the average punk & I didn't believe a word he said. He seemed like the one that needed the most theraputic help out of everyone in the movie!
If he had given up on his dark hobby, I feel that Arnold Friedman would still be happily married, living in Great Neck, New York, living a happy retirement. Sadly, its only a ""what if"" question.",1089676800,11,4061,4.549180327868853
1941825,5,B0000SXK0Y,"Making a documentary is much less restricting than fiction. If you make a work of fiction, you are forced to stay within the constructed limits of ""believability"" which we have concocted, where it is perfectly acceptable to portray sound in space but bad form to make an ""evil"" person more complex than a Graham cracker.
Capturing the Friedmans is the kind of story that would be impossible to write as fiction. It documents on-screen a conspiracy to accuse and imprison a man without evidence, on the sole basis of pornographic magazines. It gives us home videos of the family while all this is going on, a family that is deteriorating. It gives us villains that spill the beans to us, as bumbling than a space age tyrant (what else should we think of a judge who says ""I knew he was guilty before even hearing the case"" ?)
The story, ostensibly, concerns the case of one Arnold Friedman, a respected and honoured retired teacher who teaches computer class in the basement of his home, and his wife and three boys. The police finds out that he mailed someone to receive an illegal pornographic magazine. They eventually manage to nail him to rights and investigate his house, finding a pile of child pornography.
This is not the end, however. Using deceptive interrogation techniques (as is so common in such cases), the police gets dozens of kids to testify that they have been molested by Arnold. His youngest son Jesse is also accused. Both are accused of sodomizing more than twenty boys in the basement.
There is such a contrast between the human, sometimes quarreling, Friedmans, and the callous rationalizations of their accusers, that it is hard not to take sides for the family. Furthermore, the evidence is incredibly flimzy : for one thing, we are supposed to believe that boys were getting bloodied in the basement, and no parent ever found out about it for years before the accusations. We even have the audio of one of the police ""interrogations"", which are a combination of suggestion and intimidation.
It is hard not to see this movie as anything but a powerful indictment of the justice system, and social dynamics in general. Child abuse scares of all stripes are typified here : the witch-hunt atmosphere, the social prejudice, the trumpeted charges. Unfortunately, like most witch-hunts, it does not have a happy ending. A powerful testimony to the suffering of the common man against the system.",1089504000,7,2417,4.854721549636804
1941846,4,B0000SXK0Y,"This compelling documentary about the Friedman family and a child sexual abuse court case that turned their lives upside down is a heartbreaking peek into the lives of one very disfunctional family. Like most families who have painful secrets they want to suppress, the Friedmans (except for the mother), act as if absolutely nothing is wrong, that the charges are silly and that everything will be cleared up as quickly as a parking ticket. On the evening before the family patriarch, Arnold Friedman, is to begin serving his prison sentence, the family is partying like it's New Year's Eve. And the same holds true for the day on which the son charged as an accomplice, Jesse Friedman, plans to plead guilty in court. The brothers are goofing off on the courthouse lawn!!
Of course we, as objective viewers, realize that all of this behavior is a desperate attempt to avoid dealing with some serious tears in the family fabric. Arnold pleads innocent to molesting boys to whom he had been providing computer classes in his basement, but is it a coincidence that he seems to go to prison with a substantial sense of relief? The boys paint their mother as a demon intent on destroying the family, but it's the mother who comes across as being the most grounded in reality and the only one (besides Arnold himself) who understands the gravity of the family's circumstances. No, these certainly are not the Waltons.
The documentary does a very compelling job of casting doubt on the fact that Arnold and his son were guilty of molesting boys in that computer class. Our sympathies definitely lie with them, until we find out late in the film that they were probably lying to the authorities and, because we as viewers have become so vested in their story, to us. We probably will never know exactly what happened during those classes. Arnold asserts to his dying day that he never molested any of those students, but he does admit to molesting other boys. So how are we supposed to feel? Glad that he receives punishment for past crimes, or angry at the judicial system for fabricating a crime where one didn't exist? It's a complicated set of emotions the film maker leads his audience through, and it makes for a superb documentary.

But I have a quibble. What really happened isn't all that hard to figure out, it's grippingly captured. It's just that the film deals with it in such a round-about way, teasing us instead of boldly confronting the truth. Too much is left for us to figure out as the director puts on his Objectivity hat and tries to give us all viewpoints fair and square. Being fair doesn't necessarily mean being without an opinion. The filmmakers would have known more than most of us about this, and a more direct statement of that perspective would have been valuable.
However, the crux of this film lies in its unsettlingly intimate portrait of the family as it combusts under social pressure and media frenzy, and for that I highly recommend renting this one out at least once.",1085961600,8,1427,4.8765432098765435
1941850,5,B0000SXK0Y,"Why do so many otherwise intelligent people maintain that life can be understood in simplistic black and white terms, when the truth is so patently obvious: real life is filled with nearly infinite subtle gradations of gray? One reason is that forcing everything to fit a predetermined, predigested view makes life easier, while rendering our complex, confusing, and crazy world at least somewhat more comprehensible, not to mention less scary. Religious fundamentalists and political fanatics have done this for ages. Doubt or confusion for these people is minimized or even eliminated; they know what and what not to do at any given moment, who their friends and enemies are, who and how they are allowed to love, what to eat, what to wear, and ultimately, what will happen to them after they die. It all sounds very comforting, even appealing.
The fascinating, disturbing movie ""Capturing the Friedmans"" illustrates this phenomenon. In this film, released several months ago, we meet the Friedman family of Great Neck, New York. The father (Arnold) and middle son are charged with multiple acts of rape and sodomy of boys who took computer classes in the Friedman's basement during the 1980s. The title of this movie is perfect, because although the Friedmans may be ""captured"" -- by eldest son David's video camera and ultimately by the police -- the truth, or at least the reality of what really happened in this case, is never captured with any degree of certainty. Arnold Friedman receives child pornography in the mail, but that doesn't prove that he and his son Jesse are both child rapists.
According to the police, the judge, and most of the Long Island community, the Friedman case is black and white, open and shut, even before the evidence is examined. By popular consensus, Arnold Friedman is no longer the respected and even beloved computer teacher everyone had thought he was, but a depraved and evil monster who must be guilty of these horrible crimes.
In ""Capturing the Friedmans,"" the Friedmans' guilt is determined in the complete absence of physical evidence, with no credible experts or eyewitness testimony, or even a fair trial. Mainly, we have here, at best, questionable ""repressed memories"" coming from boys under intense and highly biased questioning by the police, as well as tremendous pressure by parents and peers to ""remember"" something. What we do not have are records of any abuse complaints filed by even one boy's family during the entire time all this rape and sodomy supposedly occurred. Apparently, out of dozens of boys and their families -- hundreds of people total -- nobody noticed anything amiss while all these horrors supposedly were taking place. So much for all that innocent until proven guilty stuff. Details, details.
As the movie points out, both Arnold and Jesse ultimately pleaded guilty, but what does that prove? A fair-minded person, one willing and able to allow for complexity, contradictions, and subtle gradations in life, might understand such pleas in the context of the situation. Great Neck, like much of the United States in the 1980s, was overcome with child sex-abuse witch hunts. Arnold understandably tried to sacrifice himself in to save his beloved son from jail. Meanwhile, Jesse, who was only 18 and an emotional wreck, was under tremendous pressure from the police and his lawyer to cut a deal and to throw himself on the mercy of the court. Given the community's hysteria and the near-impossibility of finding a fair and impartial jury, this may actually have made sense at the time, except for one small detail: Jesse almost certainly was innocent.
Sadly, because they pleaded guilty, the Friedmans never got a hearing before a fair or impartial jury of their peers. Well before that point, the judge, Abbey Bolkan, already had concluded that the Friedmans committed the crimes with which they are charged. As she says in the movie, ""There was never a doubt in mind as to their guilt."" So much for impartiality. These two are guilty and evil: lock 'em up and throw away the key.
What we have at the end of all this rush to judgment and community hysteria is a family torn apart, a community traumatized, and two possibly (probably?) innocent men's lives ruined. What we do not have at the end of all this is any sense of certainty, truth, justice, or emotional ""closure."" Perhaps an adherent to black and white thinking, self-righteous moralism, and the drawing of conclusions in the absence of solid evidence, can explain how all this happened in Great Neck, New York in the late 1980s. While they're at it, maybe that same person can also explain how intelligence information was completely distorted in order to justify launching a war against Iraq in early 2003. But for the Friedman family, for American soldiers getting shot at and blown up in Iraq, and for most people who see this movie, such explanations will likely ring hollow.",1085270400,9,4918,4.969660194174757
1941851,5,B0000SXK0Y,"Before the myriad of priest pedophile scandals, a series of highly publicized pedophile cases of questionable merit brought pedophilia into the national consciousness in the late 1980s. The Friedman case was one of the more spectacular. The Friedmans were an upper-middle class Long Island family. Arnold Friedman was a retired high school teacher and musician who taught computer classes and gave piano lessons at his home. He and his wife, Elaine, had three sons, David, Seth, and Jesse. In 1987, Arnold and 18-year-old Jesse were charged with a laundry list of sex crimes against the 8 to 11-year-old boys who took computer classes at the Friedman home. The accusations against the Freidman's were ludicrously spectacular, solicited under hypnosis, lacked a shred of physical evidence, and in some cases have been retracted. But the case diverges from other hysterical accusations of pedophilia that dominated the news at that time and is considerably complicated by the fact that Arnold Friedman was an admitted pedophile who was in possession of a large collection of related illegal literature. Case closed? Hardly. Unlike most families in crisis, this one chose to videotape its disintegration from the point at which Arnold Friedman was released from prison to await his trial until the day Jesse went to prison. So we are privy to the family's personalities and the internal strife that probably led to foolish legal decisions. There are also interviews made more recently by the filmmakers with Elaine, David, Jesse, Arnold's brother Howard, the police officers who investigated the case, the judge who tried it, several of Arnold's computer students, and an investigative journalist who specializes in unfounded pedophilia cases. But ""Capturing the Friedmans"" isn't just a documentary of criminal justice gone awry. It's a compelling look at the culture of victimhood and the prevalence of self-delusion. And, most strikingly, the film seems almost haunted by Arnold's onerous sense of guilt and self-loathing for things he had done -or perhaps only  considered doing- in the past, which may have ironically resulted in himself and his son being incarcerated for something they did not do. Everything about ""Capturing the Friedmans"" is compelling. It's an essential slice of American social history and one of the best films of 2003.",1084752000,6,2344,5.318059299191375
1941852,4,B0000SXK0Y,"A film by Andrew Jarecki
This documentary was not what I had expected.  I knew that this was a documentary about a family who had been accused of sexually abusing children.  That was all I knew about this film, and my expectations were only that this was going to be a difficult film to watch.  The structure and the family dynamic were not at all what I expected.
This is the story of the Friedman family, a well to do family living in Great Neck, New York (on Long Island).  The family seems to have this compulsive need to videotape everything, so there are snips of their everyday lives on home video, as well as video diaries and interviews they have done with each other.  This feels strange, as if something is not right, and then we move into what is not right.  Because of the nature of some magazines owned by Arnold (the father) and caught by the police in a sting operation, the police had been investigating what sort of other abuses Arnold might be perpetrating against children.  They found evidence and the police went after Arnold.  The family saga doesn't stop here, however, because the youngest son, Jesse, is also implicated in the abuse and he is also arrested.
What is fascinating here (and troubling) are both the family dynamic and the question of guilt.  To say that the Friedmans have a dysfunctional relationship is an understatement, and the home videos they have shot illustrate this perfectly.  There is always a camera on, and it is not the film director, but rather the Friedmans documenting their lives.  Nobody seems to be completely well adjusted, and I'm just not sure how much honesty and support I was really seeing inside the family.
The other fascinating (and troubling) thing was the question of guilt.  The family, of course, initially starts out by admitting no guilt, but as the movie goes on, we see that perhaps that is not entirely true.  The police are working with evidence, so there must be something to be guilty of.  The lawyer says that Jesse said one thing, Jesse claims another, the judge is starting with her own assumption, and of course the public believes they are all guilty.  But somewhere along the line the actual facts start getting muddled and stories change, new revelations from the key players are brought to light, and what started as a case of black and white has suddenly become very gray.
""Capturing the Friedmans"" is a very interesting, well made documentary.  When it was over, however, I had more questions than understanding of what actually happened and who is guilty of what.  Perhaps that was the point of the film, but while the family gets a small semblance of resolution, the viewer never does.",1083888000,4,2677,4.698072805139186

1941905,4,B0000SXK0Y,"What did happen in the Friedman household? Watching the documentary made me feel like something of a voyeur, and I was asking myself why the frayed family portrayed in the film would want this conflicting and unresolved information out in the world for all to see? It seems surreal and somehow exhibitionist, but given the amount of family home video and audio tape that existed, they seemed a family intent on documenting things many of us would rather forget. Why that is in a clearly dysfunctional home in which reality appears to have been overlooked at every turn and in which all the family members appear to have at the very least ignored problems, turned a blind eye to anything questionable and lived in some state of ""unreality"" is totally beyond me. The movie was nevertheless riveting in a weird, subjective sense. I cannot begin to understand, for example, the completely oblivious and nave behavior of Mrs. Friedman, who clearly knew her husband was ""troubled"". I also cannot really understand the vehement hatred the Friedman sons seemed to harbor toward their mother. So in every sense, the film poses more questions than it answers, but the questions still fascinate.",1082246400,3,1184,4.954773869346734
1941906,5,B0000SXK0Y,"I avoided this film for some time because the sensitive subject matter seemed a total bummer. The critical hype persuaded me to finally view it and it is as depressing (and fascinating!) as I imagined it to be. It's not that the child molesters in this film are not probably guilty of their accusations, it's that the legal system seemed anxious and insecure to prosecute these men as soon as lewd act red flags flew up, the Court Judge herself reminiscing that she ""knew from the start these people were guilty"". So much for innocent until proven. For a film depicting a well publicized news story, ""Capturing The Freidmans"", instead of remaining cold and detached becomes an earnest study of human drama.",1081641600,2,706,4.795081967213115
1941907,4,B0000SXK0Y,"Just one of the many outstanding documentaries of 2003, ""Capturing the Friedmans"" is a riveting, depressing and ultimately quite frustrating account of a pedophile and the effect he has on his community and family. ...
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of ""Capturing the Friedmans"" is that, even though the filmmakers acknowledge Arnold to be a pedophile, they obviously have grave doubts that the crimes for which he and his son were ultimately convicted ever really occurred.  And, indeed, the scope, elaborateness and longevity of the alleged sexual abuse and the lack of prior reporting by any of the children who were the alleged victims do raise some troubling questions of credibility and plausibility in the viewer's mind.  In fact, this whole case has eerie and disturbing echoes of the highly publicized McMartin Preschool trial, which was happening at roughly the same time.  Even the people the filmmakers interview often contradict one another, leaving the audience not knowing who is telling the truth and who is lying - either deliberately or, perhaps, subconsciously.  It is this air of inconclusiveness that accounts for the viewer's feeling of frustration at the end.  Although the moviemakers' sympathies seem to lie more with the family than with the court, we can't help thinking that maybe no one is really telling the whole truth and that perhaps the reality, as is so often the case in life, lies somewhere in between.
If nothing else, ""Capturing the Friedmans"" serves as a reminder of just how messy and complicated an issue child molestation can be.  With emotions running so high on both sides of the issue and the consequences so devastating for all the parties involved, the film at least shows that convictions in such cases must be pursued with the utmost rationality, rigor and care.
Whatever the truth in this case may be, the fact remains, though, that Arnold Friedman's actions led to the disintegration of a family and an undeniable human tragedy.",1080950400,,1987,5.079754601226994
1941908,5,B0000SXK0Y,"What a powerful film! It choked me up to see this family fall apart via family home videos.
This film is a rollercoaster ride. One minute I was absolutly convinced of the father and son's guilt, one minute later and I'm convinced of the opposite scenario. I did draw a conclusion at the end of the film, if anyone wants to discuss it, feel free to email me.
This is a must see, not only for documenatry film lovers, but also for all who appreciate true-crime bits. I can see how people could come to totally different conclusions.
A great one to discuss at the dinner table!
Get the plot gist from other reviewers who've already said pretty much all that's to be said.",1080432000,,668,4.395161290322581
1941909,5,B0000SXK0Y,"Having being drawn to recent documentary features such as Spellbound, I took a chance on Andrew Jarecki's 'Capturing the Friedmans', having heard and read little about it. It is, without a doubt, one of the most compelling and troubling films I have ever seen. I won't re-hash the story as other reviewers have done that already, but would urge you to buy this film. Once the main feature is over you are desperate for more information, more clues and the second disc in the set goes some way to satiating that need.
The beauty of the film, expressed by Jarecki in both his commentary and in a Charlie Rose interview, is that it finally provides - albeit too late - the fair trial that the Friedmans should have been granted. Whatever the 'truth' of the story is, and we may never really know, the prejudice that was brought to bear on the case by the police, judiciary, the community and the media made it impossible for this most complicated family to be accorded their constitutional rights. We, the audience, are the jury now. Jarecki provides both prosecution and defence cases and we are left to decide the guilt.
Quite apart from the compelling material, which makes this film so much more thrilling than any Hollywood drama of recent memory, the film is beautifully shot. Jarecki exposes evidence carefully so that just when you feel that your mind is made up something is thrown in that broadsides you. Andrea Morricone's beautiful music is the perfect accompaniment to the anguish that the viewer feels throughout this painful quest for the 'truth'. The film's website (capturingthefriedmans.com)is a worthy partner to the film with some unheard audio footage, and is well worth visiting.
This is not quite an enjoyable film - the material too uncomfortable for that - but it is one that should be seen. Make sure you watch it with someone as all you will want to do afterwards is discuss it - and then you'll want to watch it again.",1078790400,47,1943,4.734513274336283
1941910,3,B0000SXK0Y,This documentary just left me feeling disturbed by it. There was a icky feeling of distrust and confusion. David seemed to be Jesse and Arnold's voice - but he himself seemed to be so bizarre that I really questioned his validity. Cinematically surreal and well shot to provoke questions.,1078358400,,288,4.8979591836734695
1941911,5,B0000SXK0Y,"By the end, the viewer has been on that rollercoaster as to whether or not they are guilty.
If ""Fogs of war"" did not come out this year, I'd say this was the best documentary of 2003.",1077926400,,183,3.972972972972973
1941912,5,B0000SXK0Y,"By the time you finish this film, you will have very strong opinions of all the main participants, but very little insight over who is telling the truth.  All of that is okay, though, because the way the story is told is fascinating.
This follows the true story of the Friedman family of Long Island.  In 1987, two members of the family were arrested for allegedly molesting many young boys in their home.  Despite maintaining their innocence, both men plead guilty.  This is told through the eyes of the oldest brother, David.  He supports his father and brother to a nauseating degree.  He is 100% sure that neither of them are guilty.  Even after his father confessed to molesting two boys and being a pedophile, he is still convinced his father was innocent.  Frankly, the man turned my stomach at times.  The mother is more open-minded to the possiblity that her loved ones could be guilty, and that caused a huge rift between mother and sons.
This isn't as much a story about a criminal trial as it is a story about a family divided.  Told through actual footage of the era, as well as interviews with all the participants, this is truly a must-see film.  The DVD includes fascinating documentaries that allow more insight into the case.",1077667200,4,1243,4.655963302752293
1941913,5,B0000SXK0Y,"Nominated this year for best documentary at the Oscars, ""Capturing the Friedmans"" is one of this year's most talked about films that no one seems to know what its about. Well, here you go.
A father of a seemingly normal family is arrested for possessing child pornography, and then further charged with a huge ring of child sexual abuse that had supposedly gone on for four years in his basement where he taught a computer class to neighborhood children. Then, his youngest son was arrested as well for doing it with his father. But all may not be as it seems.
Having read about this, I expected something along the lines of the wonderful documentary ""Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills"" where a huge legal injustice had happened, and the primary focus characters were clearly innocent and had been railroaded. No. What makes ""Capturing the Friedmans"" so terrific, is that it provokes all sorts of strong emotional reactions in the viewer along the way, but by the end, we are still unsure how we feel about the guilt or innocence of these people. The family dynamic becomes very strained and there are harsh words and happenings on all sides. It is entirely unclear whether the police actually used unethical practices in getting kids to testify against the family or not. By the end, you are very shaken up and really see the complications inherent in the criminal justice system. Be sure and watch the extra disc, as it has lots of really important extra footage that probes deeper into BIG elements of the case not brought up in the actual film, as well as a premiere screening that everybody in the film attends and tempers flare. I haven't seen anything else nominated for best doc this year, but this has got to be a serious contender. Highly recommended.",1077494400,7,1780,4.726688102893891
1941914,5,B0000SXK0Y,"Director Andrew Jarecki set out to make the story of birthday party clowns in New York, and ended up finding the story of David Friedman (NYC's top birthday clown) and his family, destroyed by the arrest of his father and youngest brother for sexual molestation of children attending computer classes in their home in the late Eighties.
The late Eighties saw the hysteria of sexual molestation trials such as the McMartins in California and the Amiraults in Massachusetts. In the case of the Friedmans, truth and lies are mixed in the testimony of every participant, in the investigation and arraignment and in the appearances before the judge. In the words of the director ""the truth slithers away"" in every instance.
I don't want to reveal the outcome of the important events in this film, so I will just recommend you see it for yourself. And Jarecki carefully structures the film to ""leave in the brains"", assuming that the viewer will make up their own mind on the evidence, making each of us a sort of juror in the case.
The extra features are as important as the film itself, and shed a lot more light on the story. There are interviews with the judge, the detective who broke the case, with Jesse Friedman, the director and there is a fascinating ""what happened afterwards"" set of FAQ's as well. This documentary is an achievement in filmmaking worthy of every award it received-- possibly one of the best documentaries I have ever seen.",1076716800,10,1445,4.760956175298805

8002451,5,B0000SXK0Y,"I made some comments on a non-related movie about how we Americans have imperfectly evolved from out primitive origins. By accident, I happened to watch this film shortly thereafter. This movie illustrates the same point. An upper middle-class suburb becomes an angry lynch mob over night. Instead of white masks and gowns, the angry villagers are wearing badges, uniforms, and judges' robes.

I don't think that the case would've triggered so much anger and exposed so much weakness in our social and legal system if Arnold Friedman hadn't been found guilty of child pornography. If he'd been convicted of insider trading or embezzlement, I think society would have treated him differently and more generously. I for one am repulsed by kiddie porn and, if I were a parent in the community with Friedman living just down the street, I may have helped in getting him sent to jail. That's a brave statement on my part, but as a parent you always have to put your kids first. Just sayin'...

Another consideration is that sex offenders' rights have become more codified legally over the past decade. I'm being optimistic when I say that if this incident occurred today, maybe all of us as a society would have behaved more like civilized Americans rather than the angry townfolk with torches and ropes.

The weirdest thing for me was how the Friedmans liked to film home movies of everything, good and bad. I can't decide if I admire them for their warts-and-all approach, o yor if the father's sickness spread to the whole family. Watching movies of your family split-up isn't as cold and detached as watching under-age porn stars for your own viewing pleasure--but it might be in the same ball-park.",1468368000,,1698,4.868512110726644
