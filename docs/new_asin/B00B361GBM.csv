You'll get 5x the WrestleMania for just slightly more than 2x the money.",1371427200,2,1128,6.185897435897436
5554489,4,B00B361GBM,"A couple of notes here in that this is the exact same version of this event taken from the WrestleMania Anthology set meaning that all references to ""WWF"" & various music has been changed to due the rights expiring but there is no blurring of the WWF logo since this event happened before the ""Attitude Era.""

""The Greatest Wrestling Event Of All Time"" is what this was advertised to be as this was the event that started it all from New York City's Madison Square Garden where the idea of combining the sport of wrestling together with the celebrities & media presence of the entertainment industry to create the era that is now known as ""Rock N' Wrestling Connection.""  Celebrities include Billy Martin & Liberace & The New York City Rockettes.

The main event match was WWE Champion Hulk Hogan teaming with Hollywood superstar Mr. T with ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka in their corner against ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper & ""Mr. Wonderful"" Paul Orndorff with ""Cowboy"" Bob Orton in their corner which featured boxing legend Muhammed Ali as the special enforcer who did end up getting involved in the action when things got out of hand.  Other matches include Womens Champion Leilani Kai with Fabulous Moolah vs. Wendi Richter with pop music superstar Cyndi Lauper in her corner, $15,000 Bodyslam Challenge between Andre The Giant & Big John Studd, Tag Team Champions U.S. Express vs. Nikolai Volkoff & Iron Sheik, Intercontinental Champion Greg Valentine vs. Junkyard Dog, Brutus Beefcake vs. David Sammartino with Bruno Sammartino in his corner, Ricky Steamboat vs. Matt Borne, King Kong Bundy making history (or did he?) vs. S.D. Jones, and Tito Santana vs. Executioner in the very first match in  WrestleMania history.

Well once you get past all the hype of it being the very first Mania & all the celebrity involvement, this was still a loaded event for it's time that delivered on both good wrestling & entertainment so I would recommend this for fans of that time period or for those starting out their collection because you can't have them all without the first one.",1364428800,5,2060,4.871428571428571

The very first one, the one that started it all, the grand daddy of them all, WrestleMania. One of if not the most historic card in history, maybe not the best but this had to be a success at least in Vinces eyes for his company to continue. Luckily for him he had a guy named Roddy Piper there to bring in all those eyes. I am not discounting Hogan, T, and Orndorff, Orton or Snuka or anyone else on the card for that matter. I just honestly believe without that great of a villain to go against company face Hulk Hogan it would not have been the same. Regardless after going back and watching this again it all seems so fun now. The Rock and Wrestling connection stuff, all of the celebrities and of course the great wrestlers that made it happen.

Spoilers

1. THE EXECUTIONER VS TITO SANTANA-the very first match in Wrestlemania history would see legend Tito Santana have a fun yet quick opening match. Much better than you would think it would be this match was a great opening. Tito would get the submission win with the figure-four leglock.

2. KING KONG BUNDY VS S.D. JONES-now when I said quick for that opening match this one blows it out of the water time wise. This match lasts for seconds or something like that. Bundy makes quick work of Jones after a bear hug and slam into the corner. After a big splash he gets the pin.

3. RICKY STEAMBOAT VS MATT BORNE-we follow that up with another fun matchup as that was what this event was about. Not the best match ever but still a very good one with The Dragon winning the match after flying through the air with a big cross body. A little taste of the greatness he would be a part of a few years later with the great Macho Man.

4. DAVID SAMMARTINO VS BRUTUS BEEFCAKE-this match is actually one of my favorite Brutus matches. This one is a little harder hitting than previous bouts. Now as the match ended in a double DQ I actually think this match should have been a tag match so Bruno could have wrestled at Mani, at lost chance but still a fun match. This was the second longest match of the night.

5.[I-C TITLE]GREG VALENTINE VS JUNKYARD DOG-the first title match in Mania history and obviously the first I-C title match. Good match right here that had more psychology  and feeling each other out process. Good hard hitting battle between two legends with The Hammer getting the win by pin fall with his feet on the ropes. So after Tito comes back out to tell the ref what happened they decide to restart the match. Valentine though had enough and got counted out immediately, losses the bout but retains the strap. Fun match but man the super popular JYD should have had a title run in the WWF.

6.[TAG TITLE]THE U.S. EXPRESS VS THE IORN SHEIK & NIKOLI VOLKOFF-the U.S. Express was Barry Windham and Mike Rotundo who came in as the champs. This was a great tag match with back and forth action with each team looking great here. Blassie and his cane come into play leading to Sheik and Volkoff becoming the new tag champs.

7. ANDRE THE GIANT VS BIG JOHN STUDD-this match was a Body Slam Challenge as Andre had to slam Studd before the time limit ended or he had to retire. This was another fun match in which The Giant came out on top by slamming Studd.

8.[WOMENS TITLE]LEILANI KAI VS WENDI RICHTER-like I said before for the others this was just a fun match. Part of the Rock and Wrestling Connection since a certain favorite singer of a great Goonies song was at ringside. Great match with Wendi coming out on top.

9. RODDY PIPER & PAUL  ORNDORFF VS HULK HOGAN & MR T-the main event and the one everyone was waiting for. Me personally I have always been a Piper fan and thought that he and Orndorff should have won this. Of course that may not have been the popular choice but I Iove Piper. Plus with Bob Orton Jr. at ringside this should have been a lock but Jimmy Snuka evened the odds.

One of the most important events in the history of wrestling and when looking back now not everything or every match was a classic per say but everything about this first one was fun. Sure you can call it nostalgia watching it after all these years and saying that but whatever. If you are a wrestling fan there is plenty to like here even if it isn't everything.",1427414400,,4237,4.367217280813215
