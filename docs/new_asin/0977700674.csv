7794832,5,0977700674,This DVD is great as other reviewers have noted; definitely glad that I bought it! Very concise and helpful. It also came in a timely manner.,1392422400,,141,4.461538461538462
7794833,4,0977700674,"I like how the videos interpose the pictures/graphics of the muscle on the actual body.  Makes it much easier to picture.
I also like that people with different body types are used to emphasize the position of the muscles.
However, the further the DVD goes the less it follows the book, skipping many topics - hence a 4 point review.  I don't think there is anything on bones at all on the DVD and several muscles are skipped.
Was useful in the first term of Palpation classes, but later - not so much.",1307404800,,502,4.387096774193548

7794835,5,0977700674,"My teacher showed me this title in class but only the 4th edition, the 5th edition has even more details. The pictures and the drawings of the muscles are very accurate. Excellent reference book or a learning tool . One muscle one page, the photograph of the muscle and the artistic drawing with the underlying tissues are in the same size and position which is invaluable for visualizing .It explains posture with great details , there are a lot of research based charts in the book , also cheklists for assessments. It also shows all the muscle testings with picture illustrations . It comes with Primal 3D Anatomy CD Rom , it is a very good although some what outdated software, however again very accurately shows all the different structures in layers. The price is unbeatable 57 bucks for hardcover textbook/cd. Ordered it from Canada and from Amazon , 4 days later I had the book , great service ! Hey you health care professionals massage and physio therapists don't hesitate to get this one you will thank it to me later. Cheers",1246147200,,1037,4.672131147540983
