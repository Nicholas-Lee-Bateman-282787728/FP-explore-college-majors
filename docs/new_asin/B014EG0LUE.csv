7390928,5,B014EG0LUE,I heard about this several years ago and was excited when it was finally made. I really enjoyed the segments but the frame story did get cheesy and a tad stupid at times. I definitely enjoyed Dustin Mills' segment which is a precursor to his fantastic movie Applecart.,1453420800,2,268,4.604166666666667

8730479,3,B014EG0LUE,"Not bad, but not great.  Typical Troma film, so it was entertaining, but not really what i would call a horror film.  5 stories in all, surrounded by a skit trying to tie them all together.  Semi funny at times, but as i said, definately not spooky or horrorish.",1472083200,,262,4.3061224489795915
