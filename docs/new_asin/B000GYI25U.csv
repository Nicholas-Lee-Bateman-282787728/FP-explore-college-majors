8135363,5,B000GYI25U,"This dvd is excellent look at Dean Reed, American rock & roll singer turned international peace activist.  In the 1980s, Smart Alec me, I decided to end the cold war. I soon found out that Dean Reed had been working on that for many years. Soviet people told me all about him and I had the honor and pleasure of meeting him. This excellent dvd and the German website, deanreed.de will reveal the amazing story. I didn't have time to pay attention to Dean Reed's music until recent years. There are some great cuts online, and on this disc. I loved and respected him. Life is delicate and short for everyone. I think his story would be good for anyone. He understood the lying propaganda that keeps people from achieving peace. His story is important history from which much can be learned. I viewed the movie with Dean Reed, bought the disc several years after his death. Tech. quality is good. (Bob North, aka R. Perschmann).",1363564800,2,926,4.578313253012048
8135364,5,B000GYI25U,I first saw this film about two years after it was released.  I think Dean's messages might be more relevant today than they were when he was alive.  Excellent story that most Americans will never have heard about.,1290038400,2,214,4.605263157894737
8135365,5,B000GYI25U,"I like Dean Read very much. Yesterday I even saw a guy very alike him, but I was not sure to come to him. May be he was Dean's son?
But I would like to say some on the DVD data on site.
It is stated:'Language: English, German, Italian, Russian, Spanish'. I have expected the movie completely tarnslated into Russian, having 5 different audio tracks. But alas! Only a person, knowing English can watch it, understanding all movie. Where there are other languages besides English, there are given hard subtitles. But no Russian subtitles or a Russian audio track.
So do not be misled with this given on site data on languges. Five languages, but patrtially in different places of the movie. Hard English subs on shots with not English language. Only one audio track. That's it.",1256947200,3,775,4.664233576642336
8135366,5,B000GYI25U,"I am Ukrainian guy and American citizen since 2004.
In spite of some disadvantages I'd say, ""It was good documentary movie"". Disadvantages are no option to turn subtitles ON/OFF and no scene selection feature.
(I wanted subtitles because sometimes I do not catch some words. English is not native language for me.)
However I understand that Ohio River Films did not have a good budget.

I liked listening songs performing by Dean Reed on radio or TV in my late teenager years. (It was beginning of 80-s. I did live in Kiev, Ukraine.) I listened the information about this man from different news. I watched movies ""Blood Brothers"" and ""Sing, Cowboy, Sing"" made in German Democratic Republic (It is Eastern Germany.) and translated into Russian. In the United States I rented movie ""Adios Sabata.""

However this movie, which is ""American Rebel"", told me much more about him.

""I don't believe the Soviet culture is an enemy to the American people,"" Dean Reed said. I like he said, ""Soviet"" not like ignorant people who say, ""Russians.""
Probably the confusion was the Russian Federation was a biggest republic of the Soviet Union and sometimes residents of other Soviet republics were called Russians, which was not correct. (An example is Ukraine was the Soviet republic but not Russian republic in time of the Soviet Union.) So I liked Dean knew what he said. I am ex Soviet man and agree that Soviets were not enemies to Americans.

Dean Reed said, ""I think all people should have a right to see the culture of other forms, nationalities and countries and also defend own culture at the time."" I think it is important for average American even now.

I was also impressed when I listened interview about Dean's Reed attitude to religions. We could understand that Dean was an Atheist. However being an Atheist he did not blaspheme. And also, he believed in things that all world religions did. (It means a peace, goodness, and cooperation between nations, ultimate truth, making life better place for men.)

Dean Reed is no longer with us but this movie is a good memory about him.

Although it is not first documentary movie about Dean Reed in the world but
this is the first one created by an American representative. Will Roberts and his assistants from different countries have done a good job.",1256428800,10,2298,4.817258883248731
8135367,5,B000GYI25U,"As a university music professor who teaches a class about the history of popular music, I was rather surprised and intrigued to come upon the story of Dean Reed. I must admit, I had never heard of him. When I travel I always try to visit local museums, grave sites, etc., that relate to popular music, and when  recently planning to visit Denver, CO, Reed's name began to appear in my on-line searches. For those who like a good story with lots of twists, Reed's is one to explore. It's amazing (to me) the kind of career he had. Do the same conditions exist today to produce another person like Reed? In many ways, he predates artists like Bono, who realize life is not about taking, but about giving. Very interesting DVD. Get the books, as well!",1218240000,6,748,4.45985401459854
8135368,5,B000GYI25U,"The film reflects the story of an amazing American hero called Dean Reed who travelled the world singing and promoting world peace.  The film is a documentary which talks about his life and his political journey.  Unfortunately he was much more popular outside of the US than inside and he was often threaten by American reactionary elements who never accepted his left wing views.

A must see for progressive thinkers.",1179446400,3,419,4.957142857142857
8135369,5,B000GYI25U,"This is an accurate picture of Dean Reed's life and life in general behind the ""Iron Curtain"".  This documentary is kept plain and simple and to the point, no opinionated propaganda, just the life of an American socialist (not communist - that is two different things)who lived and stood for and fought for his ideas.  Every-day life in (mostly) East Germany is shown through this film.  This is a historical document, that perfectly captured the images of the past, a past that is also my own past.",1172188800,8,499,4.712643678160919
8135370,5,B000GYI25U,"This documentary film, made in 1985 with its subject's input, is the best introduction to the life and work of Dean Reed (1938-1986).  Reed was an American rock singer/actor who turned Communist in the early 1960s and found fame throughout the Iron Curtain world in the 1960s-1970s.  He sang a wide range of material (rock, folk & country), acted in South American, Italian and East German films and TV (eventually directing a few films himself) and was a loyal Red political activist.  A household name throughout the Communist world, he was all but unknown in his home country.  He died under mysterious circumstances in East Berlin in 1986.

This well-made film features interviews with archival performance footage, clips from Reed's films and TV shows, interviews with Reed's parents, fans and friends (including Phil Everly of the Everly Brothers), as well as Dean Reed himself.  And of course, plenty of Dean Reed music.

Reed deserves to be remembered.  If you don't know who Dean Reed was, this is the place to start learning.",1172016000,4,1035,4.976744186046512
