7319724,5,B0112HPVVW,"Season 13 is great.  I will try to avoid any spoilers.  It is the final installment of the Chorus trilogy and does not disappoint. You also get some blasts from the past, with a couple of characters coming back and recycling some gags.  Also, there is great development of the character Locus, who proves to be an interesting character in his own right.  The story line also goes into the alien technology, providing an interesting backstory with that, as well.  The ending is well done and can either provide an excellent ending for the entire franchise or prepares a great leap board for a continuation of the series (I am hoping for the latter).",1445212800,2,648,4.649122807017544
7319725,5,B0112HPVVW,what a great season.  This was the end of the Chorus Trilogy and what a great way to do it.  I love the animations and the humor is still top notch.  I am really looking forward to season 14 now which they have stated will be a stand alone story which is a first for them,1445212800,,271,3.8035714285714284
7319726,5,B0112HPVVW,"The Blood Gulch Crew is at it again, and as always the cast and crew at RoosterTeeth is there to make sure we, as fans, are satisfied.  With the crew doing so much more with animation and motion capture the fights are cleaner, they're filled with details the original Halo couldn't even compete with.  The initial series began back long before YouTube was even an idea, with Burnie Burns (Church/Epsilon), Gus Sorola (Simmons), Geoff Ramsey (Grif) and Matt Hullum (Doc/O'Malley/Sarge) sitting with an idea in their head and attempting to create.  And here we are, 12 years later with 13 seasons of the longest running sci/fi-comedy series in America, with new cast members coming in left and right.

Miles Luna, lead writer for RWBY and voice of Felix in Season 12 and 13, brings in a different energy and vigor that is coveted by many.  With his storytelling and push to make this season great, it's no surprise why this season is becoming a favorite amongst the community.  Added bonus features, commentary and more, this set is definitely something to add to your collection.

Also, suck it red.",1444694400,5,1098,4.808510638297872

7319754,5,B0112HPVVW,"It's a series that stands out from normality. The creators took only the universe of the ""Halo"" franchise and made it a completely different experience.

Quickly grew addicted after watching season one on accident, made it through all 13 seasons in less time than I care to admit. The first few seasons I enjoyed listening to over bluetooth and partially watching, while working in the garage. Hope they continue making the show!",1459296000,,376,4.712121212121212

7319806,5,B0112HPVVW,"The latest season for our favorite Blood Gulch crews and the end of the Chorus Civil war (Maybe? The writers did leave us with a nasty cliffhanger, the bastards).
New animators and writers continue the work of the original RT team. I think the writing continues to be on point and I'm getting the hang of the new motion-capture they use for the fights (while it lacks the fluidity of Monty, I think they're doing great).
Keep going guys!",1452556800,,437,4.544303797468355

8723292,5,B0112HPVVW,"When RvB first came out I remember laughing so hard my face hurt.  My children were little then and because I'm probably a bad Dad I let them watch it too, bad language and all. (They both managed to grow up to be decent, caring young adults so I guess I didn't screw it up too badly.) For my part,  I think I relate to the show so much because I'm an infantry veteran myself and get frustrated by whiz bang boom action movies that don't get the soldier's life at all, which consists of long periods of boredom punctuated by intense moments of fear and excitement.  Somehow RvB manages to capture the real feel of military culture. That's a rare thing.

A Literature professor of mine in college--a supremely talented writer herself--was always careful to differentiate between what she considered genuine literature and genre fiction. According to her, the major delineation between the two is that characters grow in literary works while in genre books--SF, horror, mysteries and so on--the characters remain the same throughout and exist solely to advance the plot.

If growth and change are essential criteria then I argue RvB is art, the real thing.  For example, Tucker's transformation from wisecracking slacker to reluctant leader and brave and resourceful warrior is as growthy-changey as you're likely to experience anywhere.

I worry if I go on then I'll give something away, so I won't. I will say the ending is extraordinary and the closing song on the soundtrack, 'Contact Redux (featuring Meredith Hagan)' is amazingly beautiful. (I bought it, too.)

Caboose rocks.",1471910400,4,1580,4.935849056603773
