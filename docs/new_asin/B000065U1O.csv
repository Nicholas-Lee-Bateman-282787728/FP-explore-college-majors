1708142,2,B000065U1O,"The old 1958 B horror gets a new millenium style update. Three computer geeks, Sol, Bug and Hardcore- a psychotic  brick-outhouse hippie, are recruited by a computer company to create a scary new game, EVILUTION for a cool $1 million. One of the perks of this is that the boys get to see a REAL LIVE NAKED WOMAN!! (with plastic boobs) in order to get the characters formed right- this actually makes no real sense and just seems perfunctorily pasted into the film, but it's certainly a big thrill for them. However, once the game starts taking shape, the creature within the game comes to life when Sol puts on a virtual reality suit and is transformed. Predictably, he goes on a murderous rampage; because no Creature Feature would be the same without one. Meanwhile, a pretty girl named Laura, who is helping the misfits is receiving threatening e-mails. All this leads up to a virtual kung fu battle. Wow!
The result is so-so, and I just wanted to yank the cyber clowns from the TV set and slap them silly. This movie will probably appeal to 12 and 13 year old boys when they get tired of their Pokemon stuff. For anybody else it's pretty basic and predictable. What next? A CF remake of THE GREAT MUPPET CAPER with Fozzie and Gonzo going rabid? Wocka wocka!!",1042848000,4,1262,4.559471365638767
1708143,5,B000065U1O,"To be honest, I initially watched the film because Steven Culp, a favorite actor of mine, was in it. (Yes, that's a cheesy reason to watch a movie.) The plot sounded a little silly, so I had my doubts going in.  To my surprise, it was brilliant.
Basically, the film is a social commentary disguised as a B horror flick. The movie attempts to define what actually constitutes a monster, and probes the extent to which there is the capacity for darkness in everyone.
While the movie can be a bit contrived in parts, the film delivers overall. I found myself lulled into believing the movie would end predictably, but was pleasantly thrown for a loop.
The characters, as in any good B horror movie, are overblown and a bit unbeleivable.  The exceptions are Culp and co-star Clea DuVall. Both are engaging individually, and together, they have a believable chemistry. DuVall's evolution as a character and Culp's final speech were worth the entire movie.",1037318400,4,950,4.786585365853658
1708144,4,B000065U1O,"While not fresh in originality, How To Make A Monster is a nice diversion from the crop of films out there recently that seem to depend on star power and rock tunes to carry them.  This entry in the Creature Features series seems to be what Full Moon was trying to attempt in its hey day if it only had the slightly bigger budget.
Basically, several computer game programmers with clashing egos are hired to expedite the release of a new game called Evilution.  In the process, a power surge and system overload bring a motion suit to life and the computer then is literally playing the game out with the programmers and office staff, and it's kill or be killed with everyone trapped inside the building.
There's a fair amount of suspense, a few twists, and a lot to say about greed, arrogance, and the lessening value of being just plain nice.  The special effects mainly consist of the creature, and all else is done rather modestly which helps keep the story on track instead of being bogged down with massive digitial effects.  It's interesting to note that this is a project from the director of Swimming With Sharks.  The only sad thing is that this film seems to say that in the end, it's dog eat dog and you might as well forget about trying to be nice.
Everyone plays their attitudes to the hilt, some may be put off by the excessive language but things move along rather swiftly so you don't dwell on that too long.  I was hesitant at first to view this because I was concerned that it was going to be a Julie Strain ""breast fest"" (as if she's not getting enough exposure being married to the editor of Heavy Metal magazine), but her appearance was minimal and yes, her ""big guns"" made the required appearance to satisfy those who just have to see them.  So that part was not as gratuitous as one would think, and even the violence is just enough without getting ridiculously over the top.  Overall, it's a satisfying experience and entertains as intended which is a good feat when you consider how so many bigger Hollywood productions seem so empty and stupid and aren't worth a purchase price.
I'm not a video game fanatic and don't know much about computers, but you don't have to be a whiz to be entertained by the subject matter in How To Make A Monster.  While not a masterpiece, it's a fun ride and one of the better bets in the sci-fi/horror genre lately.  Not a cerebral experience like Session 9 or Donnie Darko, but something you can sit back with a ton of junk food and enjoy.",1024704000,15,2498,4.458333333333333
1708155,5,B000065U1O,"This movie is kind of cheesy, but one of my favorites.
If you are a fan of video games and horror movies, this would be a great match for you.
Even if the film is kinda cheesy, if you are a true horror fan, you can still appreciate it.

1708157,4,B000065U1O,"HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER takes us behind the scenes in the making of EVILUTION, the next big video game mega hit. All is well until an electrical overload causes the various computer components to create a hideous monster, bent on murder and mayhem! Can it be contained, or will it escape, causing world-wide disaster? It's up to 3 computer-geeks (including the towering Tyler Mane from Rob Zombie's Halloween 1 + 2!), a corporate drone (Steven Culp), and a young intern (Clea Duvall from Identity, The Grudge, and TV's ""Carnivale"") to battle this cyber-menace. With a fair amount of bloody carnage, suspense, and humour, HTMAM delivers some valuable, late-night entertainment. So, strap on your virtual-reality goggles and prepare for the fun! Watch for my favorite amazonian godess, Julie Strain (Delta Delta Die!) in a bouncy cameo, complete w/ sword! I only wish they'd had her in a fight scene w/ Tyler Mane. THAT would have been classic!...",1251244800,,943,5.012738853503185
1708158,4,B000065U1O,"This movie is a lot of fun, although the concept is better than the final product.

There are some cool effects, and it's always nice to see a woman winning in the end.",1235433600,,264,4.3
1708159,1,B000065U1O,"Some movies can make you cringe because of how poorly they are made. How to Make a Monster can make you cringe, but it also does a miraculous feat by getting you on its side. The writing and the acting in this movie is literally the worst I have ever seen onscreen. I am not exaggerating. There are some scenes in HTMM that are so surreal, you'll have to rewind to make sure you just saw them. In the single most ludicrous moment of the movie, Clea Duvall is explaining to a man that she is going to die because a monster is loose. The man then proceeds to slap her for no reason whatsoever. She has no reaction at all to the slap, and instantly slaps him back. I expected him to retaliate with another return slap, because then it would have totally made even less sense. What's hard to admit is that the more you buy in to the ridiculous things you are told by the characters, the more it kind of starts to make sense. Oh, and it turns out, in Hell (Where the virtual world is set), there are fish tanks that can be broken and used to electrocute people. Thanks George Huang, for being the worst person in the world.",1232236800,,1118,4.2046511627906975
1708160,4,B000065U1O,"This movie isn't the best movie i've seen.  But it sure isn't the worst i've seen.  This movie sets out to be scary and it accomplishes that, among other things.  The plot is fairly simple, in which a video game villain comes alive and tries to kill its programmers.  But what this movie lacks in plot and character development makes up for with a good cast and a great monster suit.  This movie is particularly good, but it takes itself too seriously.  But, this movie is great, and i recommend this to any horror fan.",1164931200,,519,4.410526315789474
1708161,2,B000065U1O,"Not so long ago someone got the bright idea to take a handful of old American International films released back in the 1950s and redo them for cable television...notice I didn't say remake...among them were Earth vs. the Spider (2001), She-Creature (2001), The Day the World Ended (2001), Teenage Caveman (2002), and this one, titled How to Make a Monster (2001).  Written and directed by George Huang (Swimming with Sharks), the film features Steven Culp (Thirteen Days, ""Desperate Housewives""), Clea DuVall (Ghosts of Mars, Identity), Jason Marsden (The Boy Who Cried Alien), Karim Prince (""Malcolm in the Middle""), and Tyler `Sabretooth' Mane (X-Men, Troy).  Also appearing is Colleen Camp (D.A.R.Y.L., Clue), who was also one of the producers on this film, and horror queen of the plasticine Julie Strain (Psycho Cop Returns, Lingerie Kickboxer).

As the film begins we see a group of snotty children involved in a test market evaluation on a violent new video game called Evil-ution, which, by the way, is one of the shoddiest games I've seen in awhile.  Anyway, after the children rip it a new one (they said it was lame, boring and not scary enough, among other things), the current game designers get the proverbial boot, eventually replaced by an outside team led by a weasel type named Peter Drummond (Culp) made up of a trio of antisocial misfits including an oversized paranoid sociopathic weapons expert named Hardcore (Mane), an outspoken artificial intelligence engine designer named Sol (Prince), and a nerdy, pimply toad named Bug, whose proficiency lies in music and sound effects.  As the quartet move into their new high security digs (the world of video game design is cutthroat, full of industrial spies), they meet their intern named Laura (DuVall) along with learning they only have four weeks to `fix' the game (i.e. make it scary).  They also learn whomever succeeds in making their particular module the scariest will get a million dollar bonus, which ends up resulting in some fierce competition among the three, along with a bit of not so friendly sabotage.  Anyway, Julie Strain, playing herself, is brought in, stripped down, and fitted with a telemetry suit for no other reason that to allow for us to see her big `guns', and soon after lighting strikes a nearby power transformer, sending a freaky electrical spike into the mainframe resulting in the game coming to life as it uses said suit to enact homicidal scenarios from within the game (as the suit claims various victims, it incorporates their parts).  Escape isn't possible as the security system within the building got tripped, and the whole place is on lockdown, forcing those inside still alive to try an assault on the mainframe itself.

While the film here shares the same name as the one originally released in 1958, that's about all the two have in common (the original involves a disgruntled special effects artist turning actors into murderers via mind controlling make-up).  The main issues I have with this movie is the story, while simplistic, had little focus (along with no soul) and felt like it was all over the place, and the characters were flat and uninteresting.  As a result, I checked the running time displayed on my DVD player regularly, trying to calculate how much time was left.  Some might ask if that were the case, why keep watching the movie?  Well, once I start a film, I generally like to see it all the way through, for better or for worse.  I wouldn't call this film awful, but after watching it I began thinking of all the other ways I could have spent the hour and a half required to watch the movie.  Another thing, often there were elements in the story that ended up having nothing to do with anything...one example of this was an unaccredited role by Danny Masterson, who plays the character Hyde from `That 70's Show'.  His role here was as Laura's slightly psycho boyfriend who would send her nasty emails laced with profanities.  Why?  Because he was crazy...what did his character have to do with the plot?  Nothing, as far as I could tell.  And then there's the video game...gah!  I know it was probably thrown together for the film and was meant to look like a work in progress, but still, it was incredibly chintzy and not something I'd ever be interested in playing (and I dig on violent games).  There were some bright spots...Julie Strain does appear topless for no apparent reason than to have some nekkidness in the film, her performance the equivalent to showing up, showing her goodies, and then looking for her check.  Clea DuVall, who doesn't appear nekkid, is sort of attractive, despite her mannish, Cro-Magnon brow.  I thought it might have been kind of cool had Ms. Strain somehow been incorporated into the suit and transformed into a sword wielding killer driven by the game, but that didn't happen.  I did feel some of the actors (many of whom I've seen in better roles) tried to put some effort into their roles, but given how they were written it was obviously an uphill battle.  I thought the creature effects looked cool especially once it was fully realized and outfitted with body parts, armor, and weapons.  The story does ramble along, various characters get bumped off, none of them even remotely likable (I thought Mane's character the most psychotically entertaining), eventually culminating into a really pathetic sword fighting sequence between Laura and the creature, the latter looking much like something from the Bruce Campbell film Army of Darkness (1992).  All in all this is a fairly forgettable film, one that has a few highlights, but ultimately not one I'd actively recommend anyone go out of their way to see.  I would recommend checking out the original 1958 feature as it's a bit more entertaining, in my opinion.

The picture on this DVD, available in both fullscreen (1.33:1) and anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), comes across well and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio is clean and clear.  Extras include a `making of' featurette (3:05), a DVD-ROM game, a photo galley, filmographies, and subtitles available in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai.  Also included are some unrelated trailers for other DVD releases including It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955), Wolf (1994), Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), Fright Night (1985), and The Breed (2001).

1708162,1,B000065U1O,"We cannot believe what a piece of crap this movie was. The effects in the movie were sub-par to say the least and as a cult classic it is a complete failure. The character acting is stiff and unrealistic or simply trite and uninvolving. The plot was childish, something I would expect to see out of a movie aimed at young teenagers. The social commentary was superficial, and uninteresting; honestly I think my cat may have more to say on the corruption of society than the script of this movie. Bug was such a complete stereotype with absolutely no unique character ideas, the genius and the muscle bound idiot were equally unappealing, the two ""main characters"", laura and her boss seem about as engaging as bryant gumble on a bad day. If this had been done in the 70's, hell even in the 80's they could've gotten away with this travesty, it could have been forgiven, but there is just no excuse for a how incredibly cheap this entire movie feels. If you need to feel deep without using your brain whatsoever, rent this movie. If you and your friends like to watch crap late at night and pretend to be scared then rent this movie. If you want something to eat up your time and leave you absolutely nothing in return, rent this movie. Otherwise, this movie has no redeeming quality what so ever (as a passing glance might suggest) and those who actually spend money for this thing should be ashamed of themselves.",1113091200,2,1414,4.549019607843137
1708163,3,B000065U1O,"When a game company's new game tests low with a focus group, an unconventional team of game designers is hired to make the game scary.  The team is joined by their boss, who has no technological knowledge, and a young intern.  They are given one month to turn the goofy game into a kill-or-be-killed fright-fest.

To add realism to character action, a VR suit is used to record body motion (and a topless Julie Strain).  But when lightning fries the system, things get a little backwards.  Not the game is controlling the suit and the system can not be shut down.  So what does a group of programmers do when they are locked in with a killing machine?  They star dying while trying to figure out if they can shut the thing down.

Pretty good but a little hokey.  The effects are excellent and are created by one of the best in the business.  Unfortunately the script needs some work and maybe a little knowledge of computers, games, and game design. Still, other than the crawling-through-the-air ducts scenes the story is a bit fresher than one would expect.  It works as a popcorn movie even if it isn't great cinematography.",1112054400,,1127,4.585
1708164,4,B000065U1O,"George Hueng's remake of the classics 50's film is a stunning exercise in virtual reality.  Although it starts off a little slow, once it kicks in, it is bristling with suspense and great effects.  The cast is key in keeping the movie together:
Steven Culp as the handsome owner of the company evolves in a way that's not too flattering;
stalwart Clea Duvall continues her reign as the esoteric teen queen as the selfless, innocent intern, who also undergoes a metamorphosis;
Tyler Mane, the hulking actor, who has spent most of his time hidden behind make-up (Planet of the Apes, X-Men) is an engaging screen presence, very good in a somewhat stereotypical role, and Jason Marsden as acne-infected nerd is also effective.

7961363,2,B000065U1O,"This review is for the standard DVD version of 'How To Make A Monster' released by Sony Pictures.

This is one of the Creature Features movies that were made using the titles of 1950's science fiction movies. None of these movies has anything to do with the original movies and are completely different. They use the title and just about nothing else nor do they claim too. Supposedly these movies are 'inspired by' these old movies.

PLOT/SUMMARY: A group of computer game programmers are recruited by a Software company to make the scariest computer game ever made. If they can get it done in a short period of time then they will share in a million dollar bonus. Each programmer has a specialty. Also along for the ride is a greedy manager and an administrative assistant. Personalities collide and nobody trusts each other.
One day, a power surge hits the company and somehow the computer has a mind of its own. It creates a creature that hunts down everybody in the building. It's up to the administrative assistant to save the day by defeating the computer. Sounds exciting doesn't it? (sarcasm)

COMMENTS: I didn't like it all. The plot was just stupid. I don't feel a need to add anything else.

Clea Duvall's best role was in the HBO series 'Carnivale.'

I kind of liked the conflicting personalities of the programmers. They should have done more with that. Computer geeks are always entertaining.

It's not a one star movie, there are far worse movies, but it's not better than 2 stars.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I can't really recommend this movie for very many people. It is not well done. Besides the fact that the plot is just preposterous it is just not very good. I suppose maybe if you are Dungeons & Dragons player or computer programmer you might find a bit of humor in it but other than that I can't think of anyone else to recommend it too. Certainly not recommended for fans of 1950's science fiction.

Of the Creature Features movies, I think the best was She-Creature. I also sort of liked 'Teenage Caveman.' 'Teenage Caveman' has a futuristic post apocalyptic setting to it which is a favorite genre of mind.",1508803200,,2126,4.696236559139785
7961364,4,B000065U1O,"The main characters are Laura, Drummond, Hardcore, Bug, and Sol.  They're all part of team working to design the ultimate computer gain - named Evilution.  Evilution is meant to learn from the players, and adapt to the players moves and strategies.  An offer of $1 million dollars is offered if they can get the game finished in time.  $1 million if they can make successfully make a monster.

They were so rushed they had to take several shortcuts.  First using the building's blueprints to base the designs in the game.  Then using a motion capture suit to program the character's movements.  They used research of the worst human monsters to base the personalities of the characters and events throughout the game.

The problems start when a lightning bolt overloads the mainframe.  The combinations of overloads, combined with the adaptability of the game and hardcore's rewiring everything, had a devastating affect.

Instead of the motion suit controlling the game characters, the main monster was controlling the suit.  The game's rules were kill or be killed, death if the only escape.  The suit hunts them.  Once 2 were dead it integrated itself into their body parts, then donned a helmet and body armor to make itself into the image of the monsters.

This has 4 brutal deaths.  1 died in battle.  1 was caught off guard and murdered.  1 sacrificed himself to save the others.  1 betrayed the others, and was left to die.

The final battle was done with an actual sword and with VR Goggles and Gloves.  Laura fighting the monster in both cyberspace and the physical world.

Afterwards, she looked down at a pool of water, in the game, and saw her reflection.  It wasn't her face, or the game's heroine.  Her reflection was the monster's face.  To survive she'd had to abandon all morality and all compassion.

This movie is multi-leveled, many different ways to make a monster.  First all the evil the team researched to create the digital monster.  Then the overload and suit physically creating the monster's image in the building.  Finally Laura emerging from the game, with her mind changed into a monster.",1485561600,,2120,4.843575418994414
