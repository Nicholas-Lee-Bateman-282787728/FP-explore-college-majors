8177301,1,B000NDJPSC,"NO WHERE DOES IT SAY THAT IT IS IN SPANISH, WITH ENGLISH SUB TITLES
  ACTING ????, WHAT ACTING
THIS WAS A RIP OFF FROM THE START
THIS MOVIE GOES BACK AND FORTH FROM SPANISH TO ENGLISH AND BACK AGAIN AT THE DROP OF A HAT,
IT NEEDS TO PICK A ONE OR THE OTHER LANGUGE
WHEN IT IS IN SPANISH, YOUR TOO BUSY READING THE SUB TITLES TO REALLY WATCH THE MOVIE, AND THEN IT SWITCHES TO ENGLISH,  W.T.F.
 THIS MOVIE IS LIKE WATCHING A TRAIN WRECK, AND THE MORE YOU WATCH, THE WORSE IT GETS,
 AND YOU CAN'T STOP WATCHING",1384732800,,508,3.99009900990099
8177302,1,B000NDJPSC,this was pathetic probably the worst movie i have ever seen. i bought it thinking it was a different movie with the same title. this particular machete has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. the subtitles are even misspelled,1196294400,8,224,5.081081081081081
8177303,1,B000NDJPSC,"This is by far one of the worst movie I have tried to watch. I could not even get 15 minutes into the movie. I have scene movies from the early 60s with better special effects. It seems like a little kid possible a 4th grader was in charge of the special effects. This is boring. Unless you had allot of money you could not pay me to watch this. I thought this was the grind house films version, but its not.",1193702400,13,408,3.9878048780487805
