3033669,4,B000YOCHJY,"Excellent history and rare video of races, drivers, cars and constructors. Most video I've not seem before and I've followed the sport since 1965. I would have given the film a 5 if the all the commentators were easily understood. Since I'm not British I had a hard time understanding some of them especially at the beginning. Don't let that put you off it is a very good film.",1405296000,,377,4.478260869565218
3033670,5,B000YOCHJY,"Even better than I expected. Was great to see the drivers I grew up with. Video is great, Sound is great - highly recommended",1399680000,,125,4.25

3033673,5,B000YOCHJY,"This DVD is worth a look see if you have any interest in Motor Racing or Grand Prix History in particular as it covers one of the more exciting eras of the sport. I was not disappointed in any aspect of the disc and material, however, if you are after a professional TV (BBC) type production, this is not it. The footage is very good but of course grainy and dated as expected but the sound fluctuates with the commentary sometimes submerged under car sounds and effects. But overall it still rates 5 stars. The footage of the greats doing their best to stay on the road and footage of some of Motor Racing's finest and most influential car designers makes this a must own. The program starts logically with a review of the previous decades (1950s) leaders of the sport and rolls into the reason why the 1960s changed Grand Prix forever. Note: I re-watched the disc 4 times over about 6 weeks and due to this review am watching it again tonight. Much better than what is airing on TV nowadays.",1391472000,,993,4.4316939890710385

3033675,5,B000YOCHJY,"Covers a period of international Grand Prix and Sports Prototype racing that saw perhaps the period of greatest change and inovation in the sport.  Major engine improvements, the advent of wide tires and aerodynamic devices, and the evolution to rear engine configurations all are evident in this documentary.  It moves along very briskly, so one needs to be ready with the backup button, but it is very complete and interesting.",1382313600,,429,5.114285714285714
