""The world watched helplessly [on March 11, 2011] as a tsunami [a giant tidal wave caused by an earthquake] took down the Fukushima [Daiichi] nuclear power plant.  What went wrong?  And will it cripple Japan's nuclear program?  The aftershocks of the meltdown [overheating] are reverberating around the world.  [In this program, we also investigate] if America is ready for a nuclear disaster.""

The above is what the narrator says in the introduction to this eye-opening documentary.

This documentary was an edition of the popular in-depth television documentary show ""Frontline"" that was televised on Jan. 17, 2012.

For those who don't know or are unsure, a nuclear reactor in a nuclear power plant works by fission.  That is, works by splitting radioactive elements such as uranium and plutonium. That releases energy, which is used to turn water into steam.  The steam is then forced through turbines to generate electricity.  (Note that carbon isn't involved in the process at all which makes nuclear power essentially carbon-free.  I say ""essentially because nuclear power plants are massive installations constructed with lots of steel and concrete, so it takes plenty of energy from fossil fuels to build them.)

This program effectively answers the question:

""How could this [disaster] happen in Japan, a country so well-known for its technological and engineering brilliance?""

We get to see rare film footage shortly after the disaster--massive damage caused by explosions and the tsunami itself.  The person taking this film footage describes what he was seeing as ""scenery beyond my imagination.""

It seems that the Fukushima disaster changed everything with regard to nuclear energy.  As this program explains, Germany is now taking an energy gamble.  It is set to shut down all of its 17 nuclear power plants as it transitions to renewables (such as wind and solar).

This program ends by investigating how safe U.S. nuclear energy is with its 104 nuclear reactors.  A controversial, emerging battleground is the re-licensing of the Indian Point nuclear plant, located only about forty miles from the densely populated borough of Manhattan in New York City.

Finally, as for Japan, of its 54 nuclear reactors, only six remain operational.  This is, understandably, because of public opposition to nuclear energy.

In conclusion, this is a fascinating but frightening documentary.  Can we trust nuclear energy again?

(2012;  55 min;  7 scenes;  wide screen;  televised on PBS)

8505555,4,B006WDE6EA,"This is a episode of the show frontline , which has been around for quite a while and featured many topics throughout the decades!. Pbs , like it's news department often goes international on subjects and reporting. Which is more powerful than most network newscasts. This episode tells the story of the fall on nuclear power, and yes it's falling because of several reasons. And it's not a good thing in many respects in spite of the danger of meltdowns.  You learn that most U.S. Plants are over 40 years old and only have 20 years left. they are primitive inside too. At that point we will have none of them left operating. You see in detail what happened at the Fukishima Plant in Japan. Japan is now closing all their plants. You will shocked to learn that instead they will all go back to coal which insures further ice cap melting. That green energy can't do much more than 20% of needed capacity but that's still good enough to use it. Unless some alternative to nuclear power is found we are heading for disaster wether one melts down again or not. You see that is what frontline does , it informs you and makes you look at things from many sides.  This is one of the most important problems facing the World, and lets hope they find a new source of energy soon. Perhaps something not heard of yet?  Watch this one! This was shot on good film and was aired in January 2012.  So this isn't a episode from 20 years ago.",1337385600,2,1426,4.390151515151516
