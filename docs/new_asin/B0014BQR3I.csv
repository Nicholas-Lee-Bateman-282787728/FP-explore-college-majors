3128723,4,B0014BQR3I,"I just completed watching the series and what fun it was to share with my son the series I watched when I was his age. I had certain nostalgic flashbacks while watching the shows and my son learned more about his old man growing up. My son was quick to ask how a machine gun could fire when the bore was plugged or how Troy's 45 was a BB gun with a small bore showing. I think he was so lost in the details he missed the plot.

For you older guys the set was a lot of fun. For you youngsters it's great acting and drama without the gore. A must see on cold winter nights.",1223078400,22,571,3.8803418803418803
3128724,5,B0014BQR3I,"This '60's series was a real good WW2 show. The weekly battles against ""The Desert Fox"" troops was entertaining to say the least. A good purchase for anyone who is into the history of WW2.",1221955200,8,188,4.4

3128728,3,B0014BQR3I,"I used to love this show when I was a kid in the early 70's for its adventurous pace. Today, much older, it is quite difficult to not criticize the completely unfeasible tasks performed by the ""rats"".

Let's face the fact that 2 jeeps armed with .30 machine guns with only 2 soldiers each being capable to always defeat columns of german tanks, halftracks and trucks loaded with fresh troops in the middle of the desert is a little bit too fictional ! In a real world the allied soldiers would have been slaughtered in the first minute of the first chapter !

I must say, though, that if today I like very much all subjects related to war history, Rommel and alike, it is thanks to have watched this series in my childhood. It sparkled my interest on the subject!

I am glad to see them again, specially because the transfer to DVD was very well done. The sound is good and the images seemed to have been filmed yesterday ! But if you expect to see a war series like ""Band of Brothers"" in the desert, face the fact that ""Rat Patrol"" was filmed in the 60's. Do not forget to also watch ""Play Dirty"" with Michael Caine or ""The Desert Fox"" with James Mason.",1215043200,22,1154,4.308755760368664

One thing about these DVD sets - you can watch them at your own pace. I've watched it in bits and pieces and I've enjoyed some of the episodes myself.  If you were a fan of the ""Rat Patrol"" you will definitely enjoy this set!  It sure brings back memories!  I give it 5 stars!!!!!",1212796800,123,441,3.9101123595505616

3128753,5,B0014BQR3I,"A very unique action adventure TV series,""THE RAT PATROL"" was a fast paced World War II series,depicting the Gallant fighting men in two Army jeeps,assaulting Rommel's dreaded Afrika Corp in 1942. originating in Fall 1966 50 years ago on ABC-TV,the show was quite a departure from ABC's ""COMBAT!"" TV series,winding down,and shown In Color during its final TV season,was a perfect Primetime home for these shows,as the acting and stories were well made,and well directed! created by legendary film and TV director Tom Gries (""HELTER SKELTER"") the show starred Christopher George,Gary Raymond,Lawrence Casey,Justin Tarr,and the acting talents of Hans Gudegast,who later changed his name to Eric Braedon,currently acting in Sony Pictures TV's long running ""THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS"" as ""Victor Neuman"". of the 57 half hour shows produced,this TV production was by the then team of Mirisch-Rich TV Prods. in association with United Artists Television (now MGM Television) and has been a major hit in syndication since its 50 years on Television. the props were actually used in ""THE GREAT ESCAPE"" (1963) and ""BATTLE OF THE BULGE"" (1965) and the director of photography,Brick Marquard,did a magnificent job! but amazing in the series,was it's music,which was composed by Dominic Frontiere-and that has an amazing story to it,because much of Frontiere's background music was originally used in ""STONEY BURKE"" and ""THE OUTER LIMITS"",which,like ""THE RAT PATROL"",were all released thru United Artists Television for the ABC network in the 1960s-and ABC enjoyed Dominic Frontiere's music so much,that they used these exact same
background scores in Quinn Martin's ""THE FUGITIVE"" series,that United Artists was a partner with,until ABC Films,which became Worldvision Enterprises,and later brought by CBS Paramount,who currently owns this show! i highly recommend ""THE RAT PATROL"" to serious TV fans,who grew-up watching the show on ABC,and future viewers,who won't be disappointed with the fast paced action adventure,that the series delivers! and for the record,the other half of the company Mirisch-Rich,was Lee Rich,who went on to form Lorimar Productions,which was brought by Warner Bros. in 1989 and phased out in 1993! Mirisch Rich TV Productions had a contract with United Artists TV,before UA pulled out of the TV business after ""THE MOTHERS IN LAW"" (1967-1969) series that they did with Desi Arnaz for NBC!",1464912000,,2406,5.487870619946092

3128816,5,B0014BQR3I,I watched this show every week on television when I was a kid and just to see those Jeeps  come racing over those sand dunes again in the opening titles brings back great memories about enjoying this with my family. The great thing about this particular series is that most studios are splitting up their series to snatch more money from people that really enjoyed these older TV series. (Case in point: Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea and Combat! and Lost in Space (although they are now releasing the whole Space series on Blu Ray for about a hundred bucks) Christopher George leads a small group of men in machine gun equipped Jeeps in hit and run tactics against the Nazi's during their WWII campaign in Africa. A very enjoyable show and the production values are excellent especially for a 60's television series. Special canvas covered case just adds to the nostalgia.,1428883200,,874,4.675324675324675

3128838,3,B0014BQR3I,"Good videos of a barely remembered TV show from when I was growing up in the 1960s-70s. I remember mainly the opening title shots with the jeeps driving through the desert in between explosions- thought ththa was tough as heck!! Watching the entire series also brought back memories. Some of the episodes are corny as all get-out, and some held my attention. Neat to see American WWII vehicles painted up or sort of configured as German vehicles of the Afrika Korps, although the Germans DID USE captured Allied vehicles on all fronts. Since I build model tanks, this series has given me a few ideas on how to make a ""movie tank""!! Overall, satisfied with this series. Purchased via Amazon and product arrived in a timely manner and in great shape - no problems viewing on different equipment.",1423008000,7,793,4.753623188405797

May not excite the new generations who are used to all the new computer generated stuff of today, but if you look at when it was made, there are some pretty good stunts in the show.

While at war, I saw ""wannabees"" tricked out in jeeps and .30 or .50 caliber machine guns doing patrol work.  The reality of it may be that this is not actually a very good way to do combat but it has a lot of dash and fast action.

The actors are appealing. Christopher George had great charisma & Gary Raymond was very engaging. Hans Gudegast/ Eric Braeden was perfect as the German captain. The score is rousing & the photography is first rate. The stories get rather tired & recycled---they filmed a lot of episodes in just 2 seasons---but the enthusiasm with which all involved deliver them is contagious.

The episodes are not going to be that much fun for a new viewer. They're rather silly in many ways. But if you are a fan you will find them all here and isn't that the whole point of DVDs? For the fans.",1366848000,,492,3.9797979797979797

3128916,4,B0014BQR3I,"LDRG - Long Range Desert Group - on which the show is based. fascinates me a lot

Machine-guns. 1/2-tracks and jeeps - how not to be adventurous?

Yet, week after week of 2 jeeps overcoming panzers, truckloads of Krauts and heavy machine guns with no GI fatalities is just hard to believe
I realize this is the formula of that era - Combat! where Saunders and his merry men lived on

But the world has moved on

What's good is the shows are less than 30 minutes
Not so good - plots sometimes beyond believe

Think you got to have grown up with shows from this era to enjoy/understand Rat Patrol

14 Mar
ADDED one more star now that I'm into Season II
OK, so the firepower is still not believable
Yanks fire a GPMG round and the Kraut half-track explodes
Or maybe the Machine Gun was using High Explosive Anti-Tank rounds?

Anyway, the upgrade is because the writers try to add in more than just gun-fights
So we have the Germans wanting to confiscate a batch of contaminated plasma from the Yanks
Should the Yanks give the plasma to the Jerry?",1362700800,,1043,4.401041666666667

I found season one at Best Buy for $14.99 but then found this complete set for less than that on Amazon!

You can't beat the excitement of watching derring-dos by a couple of Jeeps pumping out .50 caliber lead at the enemy head-on. Yes, they can be cheesy sometimes and somewhat unbelievable, especially when you consider these two puny Jeeps going up against tanks...but that's what makes it awesome!  With today's special effects in movie-making, today's generation might look at these clips as second rate and low-budget but that's because the technology was pretty old compared to today's CGIs. Those in the military might consider the storyline and action to be irrelevant and obsolete but you can still learn a few tricks that today's army can employ with a little twist.

3128955,5,B0014BQR3I,"I never saw the series on TV but I remember my older brother talking about it so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm only on the second disk (8 episodes per disk each about a 1/2 hour) but I must say that I've enjoyed every minute and am impress with the picture quality for such an old series. Each episode is about 1/2 hour so the stories move quickly and often seem to jump ahead but it works. Do you really need an indepth conversation as to why the group is attacking the enemy during war? Some of the episodes are ridiculously simplistic (four guys walking into an enemy camp in broad daylight, through the front gate, with guns drawn, managing to place explosives in the ammo dump, then escaping unharmed) but this series is fictional entertainment not true stories. I also found it refreshing that there is no gore or disturbing images that are so prevailent in the series and movies today. Yes, it is a war series and people get shot and die but you don't see gaping holes in the body with blood and guts gushing out. It's more like watching you kids play war, or cops and robbers, or cowboys and indians. They get shot, they fall down, their dead; that's it. I also found it interesting in the episode I watch last night that they had a run in with muslem radicals trying to kill anyone that didn't convert to their religious beliefs, sound familiar?

As I said earlier, the picture quality is great as is the audio. In many of the scenes you can hear the jeeps idle in the background. I'm not talking about the canned engine idle of hollywood, it sounds just like my grandpa's army surplus jeep back in the day. Low and slow.

In summary, this is great series that's fast moving and action packed with excellent audio and picture quality. I would highly recommend this series.",1313366400,3,1784,4.419452887537994

We always referred to it as an Australian type of the more American, Combat series.  As I re-watched it I realized that the team was a mixed lot of Commando's and it must have been the Australian Bush Hat that had for all these years given it an Australian War genre tag.  By todays standards the plots and special effects would be mundane, but if you want a enjoyable trip back in time to what television use to be like years after Howdy Doody (yes, I was a fan of that too), this would be an enjoyable war series genre to grab some popcorn and enjoy.",1310342400,,957,4.265193370165746

3128964,5,B0014BQR3I,"What a great show!  Love to see those jeeps running circles around the German halftracks and tanks.  Unrealistic for sure, but still fun.

I watched the show in the sixties as a teenager and enjoyed it, enjoyed even more MAD magazine's hilarious parody of it ""The Ratpacktrol"" which neatly summarized every one of the show's shortcomings. (Issue #114 October 1967)

But I still loved the show and when WGN started showing it after baseball games in the late 1990s I got hooked on it again, to the point of getting really irritated when games went into extra innings and preempted the Rat Patrol!  My kids thought I was nuts.

So when I found the entire 58 episodes available on DVD, I was quick to order it, although I wondered if I would still find that guilty pleasure watching the show.

Oh yeah, I do.  The DVDs are remarkably good quality, far better than the reruns I remember on WGN.  The plotlines are still just as unreal of course, and this is apparent when you watch one episode after another as I have done. And of course the re-use of footage is kind of amusing, especially when the truck lumbering off into the distance is the same one you've seen half a dozen times before.

But so what?  Love the jeeps!  Love the way the guys risk life and limb week after week to rescue one another from improbable escapades!  Love to watch Dietrich stand shaking his head at the end of the show after the Rat Patrol pulls off another dumb stunt!  Love to hear Troy growl ""Shake it!""  And Moffit to say smugly ""Piece of cake!"" after another impossible mission.  And Hitch saying to Troy reproachfully ""Who was there, Sarge--you or me?""  And Tully--well, he didn't say much.  But he did chew a mean matchstick.

My dad's favorite was Combat and he was in France during WWII, so he should know, but for me it is Rat Patrol.

3128968,1,B0014BQR3I,Until I watch Season One on DVd I'd forgotten why I stopped watching it as a kid. This was unusual because back in the early sixties I watched all the TVseries about WWII. The reason was simple I quickly firgued out that the German Officer was more professional and brighter than the Rat Patrol. He would out think them for 20 minutes and then the writers would come up with some incredible way for the Rat Patrol to win in the last 4 minutes,1267833600,11,442,4.273809523809524
3128969,5,B0014BQR3I,"Good Stuff, well worth watching.  The series starts out a little slow but picks up speed by the third episode.  The stories are excellent, dramatic, exciting. Although..., some of the action is a little too unrealistic to believe. German guards and soldiers occasionally fall down a little too easily. Also, the scoring seems a little too upbeat and cheerful at times considering the circumstances of the war.

The characters are excellent, very well portrayed, you grow to care about what happens to them as individuals in the course of the series, particularly Seargents Troy and Moffit. Dietrich, the Captain commanding the German forces in the area seems at times to be a little too easily duped to be in charge of all the artillery and vehicles and troops that he handles.  But the doubtful spots seem to get ironed out as the series progresses. The episodes become better with more thought given to how things might have really played out, and given the half-hour format the show does a remarkable job of presenting a full mission story in that limited time frame.

Some of the best episodes are directed individually by John Peyser and Sutton Roley both who also directed various episodes of the Combat! series.  In fact if you have not watched the ""Combat!"" series already I recommed getting that one first, every episode of it is a five star production and there were a long line of very famous guest stars.  Follow up that series with this one. Together they provide the best collection of high action WWII televsion series dramas produced in retro era TV.

The disks worked well , except for one disk which had a vibration problem, it would not align correctly in the player and caused a slight buzzing , although it corrected itself during actual play of the episode. but the buzzing returned when an episode was not playing on that disk.  Strange.  I'm not sure what caused it, but it was only on one disk and could be watched regardless.  The quality of the transfer is excellent, the color and sound were top notch.

3128972,5,B0014BQR3I,"For two seasons on ABC, The Rat Patrol gave viewers a thrilling taste of the war in the desert, as an extremely mobile four man team, took on the forces of Germany's Afrika Korps.  Flying across the desert sands in jeeps armed with fifty caliber machine guns, the Rat Patrol could strike quickly, and were capable of delivering extreme firepower from almost any angle.

The Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy, would not have been possible without a secure footing in North Africa.  But in the grand scheme of World War II, the war in North Africa is often overlooked.  The Rat Patrol is the only prime time American series to be set exclusively in the North African theater.  Created by Tom Gries, this fast paced, action packed drama, is all about delivering excitement, suspense, and thrills.  The Rat Patrol consists of Sergeant Sam Troy (Christopher George), and privates Mark Hitchcock (Lawrence Casey) and Tully Pettigrew (Justin Tarr) of the US Army, and Sergeant Jack Moffitt (Gary Raymond) of the British Army, Scots Guard.

The production values of The Rat Patrol are generally outstanding, and some scenes look like they could be from a feature film.  In the first season, about half the episodes were filmed in Spain, and featured some spectacular scenes in the desert, and other Spanish locales.  The opening title sequence, features some examples, opening with thrilling images of jeeps flying over a sand dune (and a stuntman almost breaking his neck from whiplash), and a tremendous wide aerial shot of the jeeps racing across the desert, all to Dominic Frontiere's magnificent theme music.  The episodes shot in Spain were quite special, but production costs apparently caused the program to be relocated to America.  The second season was filmed exclusively in California, and while the geography of the desert is not the same, and the cinematography may not be as breathtaking, it is often still very impressive.  The large amount of shooting done on location, or on the studio lot, as opposed to a sterile indoor set, adds to the realistic look of the program.  The staging and execution of many of the battle scenes is remarkably well done, given the budgetary limitations, and availability of equipment.  In general, the stuntwork is outstanding.  To save costs, battle footage and scenic shots were reused where possible, which required creative editing to produce acceptable looking results.

The episodes are all entitled as some kind of `raid'.  Often a crisis will arise that briefly slows things down, setting the stage for an exciting and often explosive conclusion.  It is a simple, but effective formula, that works time and again.  The Rat Patrol is not big on sentimentality.  There is death and tragedy, but it simply isn't dwelt upon, and character development isn't very deep.  There are a couple of forays into personal lives, but romance is not something the series writers are very adept at.

Although the level of entertainment is high, the level of historical accuracy is probably low.  However the writers clearly understood that two jeeps could not take on an army, and kept the battles to a realistic scale.  There are some missteps, but for the most part the missions are credible, and totally outrageous situations are avoided.  You won't find Troy and the boys trying to kidnap Rommel, or steal the secret of the atomic bomb.

Troy was as tough as iron, and his leadership truly held the group together.  The Rat Patrol, made Christopher George a star, but tragically an injury he suffered to his heart, when a jeep flipped over during production, ultimately contributed to his untimely death in 1983 at age 52.  George was married to actress Lynda Day George (Mission Impossible TV series), and Vanna White was his niece.

Sergeant Moffitt's ability to speak German, was invaluable to the team.  His father was an archeologist, and having spent much time there, Moffitt had supposedly acquired specialized knowledge about the desert.  This expertise was tapped into a few times in the early episodes, but faded from storylines later on.

Hans Gudegast (Eric Braeden) was born in Germany, and as Hauptmann Hans Dietrich of the Afrika Korps, he brought realism to his role, and dignity and character, to the opposing force.  Without Dietrich, or the occasional guest star playing an officer, the Germans are mostly indistinct battle fodder.  Dietrich's presence meant that the battle would be an honorable one.  An ethical man, Dietrich was troubled by the fanatical side of Nazism.  Tall, handsome, and with a deep rich voice, Eric Braeden is also well known for playing Victor Newman for more than twenty years, on the soap The Young and the Restless.

Whether it be racing across the sands under a blazing sun, with machine guns chattering, and sand spraying through the air, or surreptitiously creeping in the dark preparing to ambush the enemy, The Rat Patrol delivers suspense, and by the seat of your pants action, that looks and sounds fantastic on DVD.  Dominic Frontiere's music is simply wonderful, and adds greatly to the enjoyment of the program.  Any kind of bonus material would have been very welcome, but unfortunately there are none.  With a total of 58 episodes, the series is very highly recommended to fans of World War II action.",1254009600,145,5298,4.982935153583618

Sadly, George succumbed to cancer at a young age, but Eric Braeden is still very much active and everywhere on daytime TV.  He was very young when this series was made, yet they did a great job making him an older Nazi tank commander- very convincing role.  Enjoy!  Oh yeah, forgot to mention, the price for this entire series is a dollar more than what is charged for each individual season (1 and 2).

In spite of that, this is a lot of fun.  The basic storyline consists consist of four men in two jeeps on the Allied side.  Their mission is to harass elements of Rommel's Afrika Korps.  Sgt. Sam Troy (Christopher George) and Sgt. Jack Moffit (Gary Raymond) are the main ones.  Their nemesis is German Capt. Hans Hauptmann (Eric Braeden).

3128986,4,B0014BQR3I,"I'm sure many would consider this a little hokey and outdated, and it probably is, but I still find it rather refreshing.  In the absence of big budgets and lots of special effects, the series has to rely more upon classic story-telling elements, so the writing is engaging and the characters are intrinsically interesting.  Despite the time period in which this was produced, neither the Allies nor the Germans are depicted as purely good or evil - the American ""good guys"" make occasional mistakes; the German ""bad guy,"" Hauptmann Dietrich, is clever, resourceful, and imbued with integrity, compassion, and mercy, really a rather likable fellow.  Another refreshing twist is that the series employs actors with native speaking ability in the languages being used: the Germans are played by German actors who speak perfect German, the Arabs speak flawless Arabic, the Italians speak Italian, etc..  Seeing the war in Africa through the eyes of two jeep crews lends a different perspective than one commonly gets in the big war movies.  The episodes are short, only 30 minutes, which keeps the vignettes to a short duration and a rapid pace, and it requires no great commitment of time to watch an episode of two.

I had certain nostalgic flashbacks while watching the shows and my son learned more about his old man growing up. My son was quick to ask how a machine gun could fire when the bore was plugged or how Troy's 45 was a BB gun with a small bore showing. I think he was so lost in the details he missed the plot.

For you older guys the set was a lot of fun. For you youngsters it's great acting and drama without the gore. A must see on cold winter nights.",1223078400,22,571,3.8803418803418803

3363225,3,B0014BQR3I,"I used to love this show when I was a kid in the early 70's for its adventurous pace. Today, much older, it is quite difficult to not criticize the completely unfeasible tasks performed by the ""rats"".

Let's face the fact that 2 jeeps armed with .30 machine guns with only 2 soldiers each being capable to always defeat columns of german tanks, halftracks and trucks loaded with fresh troops in the middle of the desert is a little bit too fictional ! In a real world the allied soldiers would have been slaughtered in the first minute of the first chapter !

I must say, though, that if today I like very much all subjects related to war history, Rommel and alike, it is thanks to have watched this series in my childhood. It sparkled my interest on the subject!

I am glad to see them again, specially because the transfer to DVD was very well done. The sound is good and the images seemed to have been filmed yesterday ! But if you expect to see a war series like ""Band of Brothers"" in the desert, face the fact that ""Rat Patrol"" was filmed in the 60's.

3363250,5,B0014BQR3I,"A very unique action adventure TV series,""THE RAT PATROL"" was a fast paced World War II series,depicting the Gallant fighting men in two Army jeeps,assaulting Rommel's dreaded Afrika Corp in 1942. originating in Fall 1966 50 years ago on ABC-TV,the show was quite a departure from ABC's ""COMBAT!"" TV series,winding down,and shown In Color during its final TV season,was a perfect Primetime home for these shows,as the acting and stories were well made,and well directed! created by legendary film and TV director Tom Gries (""HELTER SKELTER"") the show starred Christopher George,Gary Raymond,Lawrence Casey,Justin Tarr,and the acting talents of Hans Gudegast,who later changed his name to Eric Braedon,currently acting in Sony Pictures TV's long running ""THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS"" as ""Victor Neuman"". of the 57 half hour shows produced,this TV production was by the then team of Mirisch-Rich TV Prods. in association with United Artists Television (now MGM Television) and has been a major hit in syndication since its 50 years on Television. the props were actually used in ""THE GREAT ESCAPE"" (1963) and ""BATTLE OF THE BULGE"" (1965) and the director of photography,Brick Marquard,did a magnificent job! but amazing in the series,was it's music,which was composed by Dominic Frontiere-and that has an amazing story to it,because much of Frontiere's background music was originally used in ""STONEY BURKE"" and ""THE OUTER LIMITS"",which,like ""THE RAT PATROL"",were all released thru United Artists Television for the ABC network in the 1960s-and ABC enjoyed Dominic Frontiere's music so much,that they used these exact same
background scores in Quinn Martin's ""THE FUGITIVE"" series,that United Artists was a partner with,until ABC Films,which became Worldvision Enterprises,and later brought by CBS Paramount,who currently owns this show! i highly recommend ""THE RAT PATROL"" to serious TV fans,who grew-up watching the show on ABC,and future viewers,who won't be disappointed with the fast paced action adventure,that the series delivers! and for the record,the other half of the company Mirisch-Rich,was Lee Rich,who went on to form Lorimar Productions,which was brought by Warner Bros. in 1989 and phased out in 1993! Mirisch Rich TV Productions had a contract with United Artists TV,before UA pulled out of the TV business after ""THE MOTHERS IN LAW"" (1967-1969) series that they did with Desi Arnaz for NBC!",1464912000,,2406,5.487870619946092

3363313,5,B0014BQR3I,I watched this show every week on television when I was a kid and just to see those Jeeps  come racing over those sand dunes again in the opening titles brings back great memories about enjoying this with my family. The great thing about this particular series is that most studios are splitting up their series to snatch more money from people that really enjoyed these older TV series. (Case in point: Voyage To The Bottom of the Sea and Combat! and Lost in Space (although they are now releasing the whole Space series on Blu Ray for about a hundred bucks) Christopher George leads a small group of men in machine gun equipped Jeeps in hit and run tactics against the Nazi's during their WWII campaign in Africa. A very enjoyable show and the production values are excellent especially for a 60's television series. Special canvas covered case just adds to the nostalgia.,1428883200,,874,4.675324675324675

I remember mainly the opening title shots with the jeeps driving through the desert in between explosions- thought ththa was tough as heck!! Watching the entire series also brought back memories. Some of the episodes are corny as all get-out, and some held my attention. Neat to see American WWII vehicles painted up or sort of configured as German vehicles of the Afrika Korps, although the Germans DID USE captured Allied vehicles on all fronts. Since I build model tanks, this series has given me a few ideas on how to make a ""movie tank""!! Overall, satisfied with this series.

While at war, I saw ""wannabees"" tricked out in jeeps and .30 or .50 caliber machine guns doing patrol work.  The reality of it may be that this is not actually a very good way to do combat but it has a lot of dash and fast action.

The actors are appealing. Christopher George had great charisma & Gary Raymond was very engaging. Hans Gudegast/ Eric Braeden was perfect as the German captain. The score is rousing & the photography is first rate. The stories get rather tired & recycled---they filmed a lot of episodes in just 2 seasons---but the enthusiasm with which all involved deliver them is contagious.

The episodes are not going to be that much fun for a new viewer. They're rather silly in many ways. But if you are a fan you will find them all here and isn't that the whole point of DVDs? For the fans.",1366848000,,492,3.9797979797979797

3363413,4,B0014BQR3I,"LDRG - Long Range Desert Group - on which the show is based. fascinates me a lot

Machine-guns. 1/2-tracks and jeeps - how not to be adventurous?

Yet, week after week of 2 jeeps overcoming panzers, truckloads of Krauts and heavy machine guns with no GI fatalities is just hard to believe
I realize this is the formula of that era - Combat! where Saunders and his merry men lived on

But the world has moved on

What's good is the shows are less than 30 minutes
Not so good - plots sometimes beyond believe

Think you got to have grown up with shows from this era to enjoy/understand Rat Patrol

14 Mar
ADDED one more star now that I'm into Season II
OK, so the firepower is still not believable
Yanks fire a GPMG round and the Kraut half-track explodes
Or maybe the Machine Gun was using High Explosive Anti-Tank rounds?

Anyway, the upgrade is because the writers try to add in more than just gun-fights
So we have the Germans wanting to confiscate a batch of contaminated plasma from the Yanks
Should the Yanks give the plasma to the Jerry?",1362700800,,1043,4.401041666666667

I found season one at Best Buy for $14.99 but then found this complete set for less than that on Amazon!

You can't beat the excitement of watching derring-dos by a couple of Jeeps pumping out .50 caliber lead at the enemy head-on. Yes, they can be cheesy sometimes and somewhat unbelievable, especially when you consider these two puny Jeeps going up against tanks...but that's what makes it awesome!  With today's special effects in movie-making, today's generation might look at these clips as second rate and low-budget but that's because the technology was pretty old compared to today's CGIs. Those in the military might consider the storyline and action to be irrelevant and obsolete but you can still learn a few tricks that today's army can employ with a little twist.

3363452,5,B0014BQR3I,"I never saw the series on TV but I remember my older brother talking about it so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm only on the second disk (8 episodes per disk each about a 1/2 hour) but I must say that I've enjoyed every minute and am impress with the picture quality for such an old series. Each episode is about 1/2 hour so the stories move quickly and often seem to jump ahead but it works. Do you really need an indepth conversation as to why the group is attacking the enemy during war? Some of the episodes are ridiculously simplistic (four guys walking into an enemy camp in broad daylight, through the front gate, with guns drawn, managing to place explosives in the ammo dump, then escaping unharmed) but this series is fictional entertainment not true stories. I also found it refreshing that there is no gore or disturbing images that are so prevailent in the series and movies today. Yes, it is a war series and people get shot and die but you don't see gaping holes in the body with blood and guts gushing out. It's more like watching you kids play war, or cops and robbers, or cowboys and indians. They get shot, they fall down, their dead; that's it. I also found it interesting in the episode I watch last night that they had a run in with muslem radicals trying to kill anyone that didn't convert to their religious beliefs, sound familiar?

As I said earlier, the picture quality is great as is the audio. In many of the scenes you can hear the jeeps idle in the background. I'm not talking about the canned engine idle of hollywood, it sounds just like my grandpa's army surplus jeep back in the day. Low and slow.

In summary, this is great series that's fast moving and action packed with excellent audio and picture quality. I would highly recommend this series.",1313366400,3,1784,4.419452887537994

Sellers was even ahead of ""expected delivery date"" and order was sent the day after my order.  Having been a fan while in my teens, I was impressed with the fact it was of better quality on DVD than I recalled it being on television.  We always referred to it as an Australian type of the more American, Combat series.  As I re-watched it I realized that the team was a mixed lot of Commando's and it must have been the Australian Bush Hat that had for all these years given it an Australian War genre tag.  By todays standards the plots and special effects would be mundane, but if you want a enjoyable trip back in time to what television use to be like years after Howdy Doody (yes, I was a fan of that too), this would be an enjoyable war series genre to grab some popcorn and enjoy.",1310342400,,957,4.265193370165746

3363461,5,B0014BQR3I,"What a great show!  Love to see those jeeps running circles around the German halftracks and tanks.  Unrealistic for sure, but still fun.

I watched the show in the sixties as a teenager and enjoyed it, enjoyed even more MAD magazine's hilarious parody of it ""The Ratpacktrol"" which neatly summarized every one of the show's shortcomings. (Issue #114 October 1967)

But I still loved the show and when WGN started showing it after baseball games in the late 1990s I got hooked on it again, to the point of getting really irritated when games went into extra innings and preempted the Rat Patrol!  My kids thought I was nuts.

So when I found the entire 58 episodes available on DVD, I was quick to order it, although I wondered if I would still find that guilty pleasure watching the show.

Oh yeah, I do.  The DVDs are remarkably good quality, far better than the reruns I remember on WGN.  The plotlines are still just as unreal of course, and this is apparent when you watch one episode after another as I have done. And of course the re-use of footage is kind of amusing, especially when the truck lumbering off into the distance is the same one you've seen half a dozen times before.

But so what?  Love the jeeps!  Love the way the guys risk life and limb week after week to rescue one another from improbable escapades!  Love to watch Dietrich stand shaking his head at the end of the show after the Rat Patrol pulls off another dumb stunt!  Love to hear Troy growl ""Shake it!""  And Moffit to say smugly ""Piece of cake!"" after another impossible mission.  And Hitch saying to Troy reproachfully ""Who was there, Sarge--you or me?""  And Tully--well, he didn't say much.  But he did chew a mean matchstick.

My dad's favorite was Combat and he was in France during WWII, so he should know, but for me it is Rat Patrol.

Airborne jeeps!  Manly guys blowing things up!  Good triumphing over evil!  What's not to love?",1281571200,5,1919,4.5145348837209305

The packaging was nicely done and overall I am pleased with the collection. I give it 4 stars. I suppose when I was a kid 2 jeeps with 30 cal. machine guns defeating columns of enemy vehicles supported by infantry units while never receiving a scratch was entirely possible.,1278633600,,612,4.239316239316239
3363465,1,B0014BQR3I,Until I watch Season One on DVd I'd forgotten why I stopped watching it as a kid. This was unusual because back in the early sixties I watched all the TVseries about WWII. The reason was simple I quickly firgued out that the German Officer was more professional and brighter than the Rat Patrol. He would out think them for 20 minutes and then the writers would come up with some incredible way for the Rat Patrol to win in the last 4 minutes,1267833600,11,442,4.273809523809524
3363466,5,B0014BQR3I,"Good Stuff, well worth watching.  The series starts out a little slow but picks up speed by the third episode.  The stories are excellent, dramatic, exciting. Although..., some of the action is a little too unrealistic to believe. German guards and soldiers occasionally fall down a little too easily. Also, the scoring seems a little too upbeat and cheerful at times considering the circumstances of the war.

The characters are excellent, very well portrayed, you grow to care about what happens to them as individuals in the course of the series, particularly Seargents Troy and Moffit. Dietrich, the Captain commanding the German forces in the area seems at times to be a little too easily duped to be in charge of all the artillery and vehicles and troops that he handles.  But the doubtful spots seem to get ironed out as the series progresses. The episodes become better with more thought given to how things might have really played out, and given the half-hour format the show does a remarkable job of presenting a full mission story in that limited time frame.

Some of the best episodes are directed individually by John Peyser and Sutton Roley both who also directed various episodes of the Combat! series.  In fact if you have not watched the ""Combat!"" series already I recommed getting that one first, every episode of it is a five star production and there were a long line of very famous guest stars.  Follow up that series with this one. Together they provide the best collection of high action WWII televsion series dramas produced in retro era TV.

The disks worked well , except for one disk which had a vibration problem, it would not align correctly in the player and caused a slight buzzing , although it corrected itself during actual play of the episode. but the buzzing returned when an episode was not playing on that disk.  Strange.  I'm not sure what caused it, but it was only on one disk and could be watched regardless.  The quality of the transfer is excellent, the color and sound were top notch.

3363469,5,B0014BQR3I,"For two seasons on ABC, The Rat Patrol gave viewers a thrilling taste of the war in the desert, as an extremely mobile four man team, took on the forces of Germany's Afrika Korps.  Flying across the desert sands in jeeps armed with fifty caliber machine guns, the Rat Patrol could strike quickly, and were capable of delivering extreme firepower from almost any angle.

The Allied invasion of Sicily and Italy, would not have been possible without a secure footing in North Africa.  But in the grand scheme of World War II, the war in North Africa is often overlooked.  The Rat Patrol is the only prime time American series to be set exclusively in the North African theater.  Created by Tom Gries, this fast paced, action packed drama, is all about delivering excitement, suspense, and thrills.  The Rat Patrol consists of Sergeant Sam Troy (Christopher George), and privates Mark Hitchcock (Lawrence Casey) and Tully Pettigrew (Justin Tarr) of the US Army, and Sergeant Jack Moffitt (Gary Raymond) of the British Army, Scots Guard.

The production values of The Rat Patrol are generally outstanding, and some scenes look like they could be from a feature film.  In the first season, about half the episodes were filmed in Spain, and featured some spectacular scenes in the desert, and other Spanish locales.  The opening title sequence, features some examples, opening with thrilling images of jeeps flying over a sand dune (and a stuntman almost breaking his neck from whiplash), and a tremendous wide aerial shot of the jeeps racing across the desert, all to Dominic Frontiere's magnificent theme music.  The episodes shot in Spain were quite special, but production costs apparently caused the program to be relocated to America.  The second season was filmed exclusively in California, and while the geography of the desert is not the same, and the cinematography may not be as breathtaking, it is often still very impressive.  The large amount of shooting done on location, or on the studio lot, as opposed to a sterile indoor set, adds to the realistic look of the program.  The staging and execution of many of the battle scenes is remarkably well done, given the budgetary limitations, and availability of equipment.  In general, the stuntwork is outstanding.  To save costs, battle footage and scenic shots were reused where possible, which required creative editing to produce acceptable looking results.

The episodes are all entitled as some kind of `raid'.  Often a crisis will arise that briefly slows things down, setting the stage for an exciting and often explosive conclusion.  It is a simple, but effective formula, that works time and again.  The Rat Patrol is not big on sentimentality.  There is death and tragedy, but it simply isn't dwelt upon, and character development isn't very deep.  There are a couple of forays into personal lives, but romance is not something the series writers are very adept at.

Although the level of entertainment is high, the level of historical accuracy is probably low.  However the writers clearly understood that two jeeps could not take on an army, and kept the battles to a realistic scale.  There are some missteps, but for the most part the missions are credible, and totally outrageous situations are avoided.  You won't find Troy and the boys trying to kidnap Rommel, or steal the secret of the atomic bomb.

Troy was as tough as iron, and his leadership truly held the group together.  The Rat Patrol, made Christopher George a star, but tragically an injury he suffered to his heart, when a jeep flipped over during production, ultimately contributed to his untimely death in 1983 at age 52.  George was married to actress Lynda Day George (Mission Impossible TV series), and Vanna White was his niece.

Sergeant Moffitt's ability to speak German, was invaluable to the team.  His father was an archeologist, and having spent much time there, Moffitt had supposedly acquired specialized knowledge about the desert.  This expertise was tapped into a few times in the early episodes, but faded from storylines later on.

Hans Gudegast (Eric Braeden) was born in Germany, and as Hauptmann Hans Dietrich of the Afrika Korps, he brought realism to his role, and dignity and character, to the opposing force.  Without Dietrich, or the occasional guest star playing an officer, the Germans are mostly indistinct battle fodder.  Dietrich's presence meant that the battle would be an honorable one.  An ethical man, Dietrich was troubled by the fanatical side of Nazism.  Tall, handsome, and with a deep rich voice, Eric Braeden is also well known for playing Victor Newman for more than twenty years, on the soap The Young and the Restless.

Whether it be racing across the sands under a blazing sun, with machine guns chattering, and sand spraying through the air, or surreptitiously creeping in the dark preparing to ambush the enemy, The Rat Patrol delivers suspense, and by the seat of your pants action, that looks and sounds fantastic on DVD.  Dominic Frontiere's music is simply wonderful, and adds greatly to the enjoyment of the program.  Any kind of bonus material would have been very welcome, but unfortunately there are none.  With a total of 58 episodes, the series is very highly recommended to fans of World War II action.",1254009600,145,5298,4.982935153583618

In the absence of big budgets and lots of special effects, the series has to rely more upon classic story-telling elements, so the writing is engaging and the characters are intrinsically interesting.  Despite the time period in which this was produced, neither the Allies nor the Germans are depicted as purely good or evil - the American ""good guys"" make occasional mistakes; the German ""bad guy,"" Hauptmann Dietrich, is clever, resourceful, and imbued with integrity, compassion, and mercy, really a rather likable fellow.  Another refreshing twist is that the series employs actors with native speaking ability in the languages being used: the Germans are played by German actors who speak perfect German, the Arabs speak flawless Arabic, the Italians speak Italian, etc..  Seeing the war in Africa through the eyes of two jeep crews lends a different perspective than one commonly gets in the big war movies.  The episodes are short, only 30 minutes, which keeps the vignettes to a short duration and a rapid pace, and it requires no great commitment of time to watch an episode of two.  Again, this is not Shakespeare, but it's a fun and entertaining series for what it is.",1229904000,16,1302,4.9495412844036695

8255010,5,B0014BQR3I,"I received this order, but when I went to play the first disc in the first box, the disc had problems.  It was jumping around and in the middle of the disc, it went from the middle of one episode to the middle of the next episode.  So I did not get to see both episodes totally.  Is there that I could get a replacement of the one disc or do I need to do an exchange of the whole thing?  I would appreciate it.
Thank you.",1515456000,,421,3.8045977011494254

8255016,5,B0014BQR3I,"Raids and raids. A lot of fun. Tragically, the stunts eventually led to Christopher George's death, but that aside, for the budget, the writing was on average, above par. Hans Gudegast, now known publicly as Eric Braeden, makes the show as their persistent and honorable foe, and is the perfect foil for the American brashness. This series doesn't play well in England, though, as the actual desert raiders were English, South Africans, Rhodesians, and ANZACs. If you ignore that, most of the stories are decent -- though a few had the rats get into situations you knew should have gotten them killed. And of course, there's the score by Dominic Frontiere. Watch the rats have their dangerous fun ...",1487894400,3,700,4.890756302521009
