8054200,3,B0007YV2CE,"Look I love Stan and his music as much as anyone, and frankly most of the videos on here aren't even his best material, rather songs he produced as singles for record companies back in the day.

For instance I still love ""The Big Heat"" single and ""Drive She Said"" for what they are, but c'mon, they are not nearly as genuine nor as good as the rest of the songs on that classic album, those two songs were cut and dried to be radio-friendly 80's singles.  Thankfully ""those"" 2 videos in particular are of decent quality compared to the rest of the video on this unfortunate DVD. But you know, that's what you get on a ""video collection"" DVD of this type.

I was all too excited to see songs like ""The Show Must Go On"" performed live on the DVD, but it, like everything else on this disc, is of such poor quality, that it fails to be much more than a shoddy collector's item for his fans.

In fact some of the live songs on here (Ring Of Fire ""minicam"" cut) are so God awful, I can't even listen to them, seriously, you'll find much better stuff on YouTube.

The biggest sin of this DVD is that there is nothing from Wall Of Voodoo's ""Go West"" album on this disc other than ""Mexican Radio,"" which is just sad. I do enjoy ""Dark Continent,"" and ""Call Box,"" ""Back In Flesh"" etc.., and the quality of those videos are acceptable here, but to not have ANYTHING from Go West is ridiculous.  Again, seek YouTube for great footage of ""Call Of The West"" and ""Lost Weekend"" if you're looking for great video of the early days.

For $12 I don't feel ""ripped off"" really, just disappointed, but there's enough here, considering it is all there really is when it comes to WOV or Stan.

But be honest folks when you review this, the over-all quality of the audio and video of this DVD is terrible, it looks and sounds like an old VHS tape slapped onto a DVD years ago by someone on their home PC.

This would be a GREAT collector's DVD if it were simply professionally remastered and updated for today's technology, from master tapes (excluding the bad live footage), but alas, it is not.

I hope someone comes-up with something better for Stan and WOV (and where is ""Drywall"" on this by the way??) in the future.",1329004800,,2198,4.339024390243902
8054201,5,B0007YV2CE,"This DVD is very well put together with little snippets between videos, so it has a theme of sorts. Footage from the high old days of Wall of Voodoo, Stan Ridgway's solo videos, and ""live"" footage from both, with a few clips on the road thrown in for good fun. Great stuff, and the quality is quite good, which is surprising considering some of it was recorded unprofessionally and ""live.""

Great fun and oh, the great memories! Plus some fine new ones if you haven't kept up Mr. Ridgway's work since Wall of Voodoo. I believe I saw Tom Waits in the second video in a cameo role as a bartender. Stan's lovely wife, Pietra Wexstun, a fine musician herself (check out Hecate's Angels and Drywall), pops up in the videos around 1989 or so, which is always a plus. In the end, however, it all goes back to ""that radio song"" as Stan calls it, ""Mexican Radio,"" the first video on this collection of over 30 videos, concert footage, and little extras. Also included is Stan's solo hit U.K. single ""Camouflage,"" a great ghost song.

I highly recommend this DVD to fans of Wall of Voodoo and of Stan Ridgway! They were, and he still is, the best! That's my story, and I'm sticking to it.",1216512000,3,1178,4.423963133640553
8054202,5,B0007YV2CE,"This DVD certainly features Stan Ridgway's best music videos and filmed live performances, but there's also a strong personal touch throughout, including some of the connects which feature Stan and Pietra's late, and much loved, Bart the dog. We get the impression that this film was made as much for Stan's own present and future enjoyment as for ours. The ""warts and all"" feel to it must reflect his experience of showbusiness life.

Stan has ensured that, where at all possible, the sound is fantastic (i.e. in all of the music videos and TV performances). There are a couple of live performances recorded from a distance on handycams which make me feel much better about the quality of some of my own archived '80s band videos.

I've witnessed Stan Ridgway's band play twice here in Brisbane ('87 and '97) and on both occasions they just knocked the crowd out with power, precison and pure showmanship. After a successful July 2006 ""Wall Of Voodoo Revival"" concert (as support for Cyndii Lauper) Stan has announced that he'll be  touring as ""Wall Of Voodoo featuring Stan Ridgway"" from late 2006. This DVD will be a good primer for anyone who needs to rekindle the memory of why they should definitely catch that tour. Stan says he's feeling about ready to do his 10 yearly trip to Australia, where his band will be welcomed with open (long) arms.",1156464000,,1351,4.764957264957265
8054203,5,B0007YV2CE,"Buy this dvd now! You will not be dissapointed. Welcome to the World of Stan Ridgway, where too much is never enough and that's a good thing! This is a great dvd and includes so much stuff I was pretty surprised! Seems like all the videos are here, from The Big Heat to  Knife and Fork, along with some archival live stuff, Drywall, interviews, and even some home road movies too! Totally complete and it sounds great. I really dig the inserted segments between the songs too. Very arty and cool as only Stan Ridgway can do. I totally reccomend this dvd.",1130803200,10,554,4.431372549019608
8054204,2,B0007YV2CE,"I've been a big Stan Ridgeway fan for a long time now so i jumped at this vid when i saw it in the store.

Have to say i'm very disappointed.

Some of the music videos are ok but the video quality overall in this dvd is poor as well as the audio quality.

The quality of live stuff is *very poor.

Worst of all after watching the home movies of their tour travel i'm disappointed in the group itself as they all come across as whiny jerks.

Anyways buy at your own risk.",1114905600,5,470,3.9574468085106385
