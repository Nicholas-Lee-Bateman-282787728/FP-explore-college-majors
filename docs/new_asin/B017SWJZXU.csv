7533285,4,B017SWJZXU,"This was an enjoyable performance of Grease. Obviously, there are some ups and downs compared to the (now) classic film that those of us who are old enough have enjoyed for the last 37+ years.

On the whole, the supporting cast in this live performance are better singers than the supporting cast in the movie. However, often the supporting cast in the movie delivered better acting performances. Rizzo is one example. Hudgens does a great job with Rizzo's signature song, but is only OK on the acting. Stockard Channing was perfect for the acting, but not quite as good with the song.

Ana Gasteyer, a six year SNL vet, surprised me with her flat performance as the Principal. Her dull delivery makes it seem like she couldn't get a laugh in a nitrous oxide factory ... failing on one punch-line after another that Eve Arden's brilliant takes fully sold.

Hough and Tveit give solid performances in the lead roles, but they had a tough task trying to match up to Newton-John and Travolta. In many of the numbers, the difference is masked in group efforts. Hough was powerless to match Newton-John's flawless performance of ""Hopelessly Devoted to You"". She fared better on the ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" reprise. Tveit compared better in his big solo, ""Sandy"". Both sing well, don't get me wrong. But Hough doesn't have ONJ's pure voice, and Tveit doesn't have John Travolta's live-wire performance. They did fully sell their big duet ""You're the one that I want"", and the ensemble production number after that was lots of fun. Impressively, the production finished on time to the minute. LOL

The stage presentation was inspired. Sets were numerous, huge, and detailed. The live audience was cleverly stuck around most of the sets in bleachers, as if they were high school kids watching the action.",1454198400,6,1801,4.837662337662338

7533297,5,B017SWJZXU,Loved it. Happy movie that always leaves me with a smile on my face. Pretty amazing when you think of what they had to do to accomplish this. It set a very high bar for all of the TV musical remakes that have followed it. Bonus: it introduced me to the mega-talented Aaron Tveit.

7533325,5,B017SWJZXU,"I was lucky enough to watch the original Grease in a movie theatre, then later VHS and DVD. After watching the DVD of Grease Live without getting a guided while they aired it. It's basically has the same theme and songs. Just brought it to 2016. Even though they kept the 1950's as part of the theme, before desegregation, 2016 version the times we're living now. I would recommend this to anyone that asks about it. Being a movie buff, I tend to watch movies I buy several times, because you will see something different each time.

7533330,2,B017SWJZXU,"The  problem with American  shows  that are based in High schools,  is that all the students  look far too old to be still at high school. Immediately the show starts  ,credibility goes out the door. It  was the same with the original Broadway show  and the  filmed  version  a few years later. I did enjoy  seeing the original  stage version of  Grease  and the  film version  in 70mm -both in New York. No matter how much  I enjoyed them, they all suffered  with the same  lack of credibility  as  did this  latest version recorded live. I am not denying  that the music  and the entire cast were brilliant. Recording  it live  however ,was a mistake..Too many  camera zooms and some of the sets  were  far too big for the intimacy that  the scene  required.",1477612800,2,760,4.440298507462686

7533332,5,B017SWJZXU,"I was a big fan of Grease so it was exciting to see Fox produce a live production of the movie. I honestly didn't know what to expect for this live production because it stars talented performers such as Julianne Hough and Vanessa Hudgens but at the same time they're doing it on live TV so, they cant afford to make mistakes.

Overall, it was successful. They followed the original story of Grease with the same dialogue and same sequence of events. But there were also changes such as their dance moves while performing Born To Hand Jive, they changed the dance moves to make it look more modern. Their costumes were on point, they focused on every detail in the original casts costumes and made it their own. Their acting was really good considering that it was a live production and that a single mistake could ruin the whole show. Aaron Teivit, who plays Danny on the show, was okay but not that great. To me, he wasn't a right fit to play Danny, they shouldve casted an actor that has the same body type and aura as John Travolta on the previous movie. Julianne Hough, who played Sandy did amazing and absolutely stole the show when she sang Hopelessly Devoted To You. The only flaw they had was the audio and camera work, the audio would come off in some of the performances. When they did the car-racing scene, the camera work was shaky and made the scene a bit corny and amusing. But the finale was the best, when everyone was dancing to Born To Hand Jive you can really see that they're enjoying their performance and you can feel the whole energy of the cast. Grease Live made you feel like youve watched a Broadway show from the comfort of your own home.",1476748800,,1666,4.4267100977198695

Tommy Kail masterfully directs this feat of live television, battling the weather and a live audience. Julianne Hough's dance experience helps her nail the role of Sandy, while Aaron Tveit has a James Dean type swagger as Danny Zuko. Stand outs are Vanessa Hudgens as Rizzo and Jordan Fisher as Doody. For all those who say ""But it's not Grease"" or ""He's no Travolta"", I say that this is more of a modern interpretation, and it is truly well done.",1462838400,,555,4.616161616161616

7533407,5,B017SWJZXU,"Best live performance of Grease. Very high production quality. Great lead roles. Considering it was a live TV broadcast, there were hardly any glitches and the blocking was astounding. I think I like this version slightly better than the Travolta version . . . with minor exceptions:
1. Choreography was fabulous, but ""Greased Lightning"" has an established choreography that should have been at least worked into this version. This version made the leads look like they were brushing ants off their bodies.
2. Beauty School Dropout was well-performed by Boyz 2 Men but didn't have as much as a 50's feel. Plus the song works better with a real crooner from the ""era"". I would have gone with Michael Bubl or someone similar. Also the new song before Beauty School Dropout was a lovely song for Frenchy to sing, but needed to be re-written in the 50's mode. It was too modern.
Other than those two issues, I think this version had lots to offer in camera work, blocking, youth (the cast overall looked younger than the Travolta cast, but still could have been a bit younger. This is high school, after all), audio quality, better innuendos, and better logic (i.e.. using the nerd to win the race, the reason behind Sandy backing out of the dance, etc.).

Complaints? the voices of the actors were not strong enough for my tastes. Vanessa Hudgens as Rizzo was a very weak portrayal. The support cast was very good and as for the leads....here it comes....Julianne Hough as Sandy was good, she sang well, danced very well but her acting was stilted at best. Aaron Tveit as Danny Zucco......better than good, Acted well,, sang very well and danced exceedingly well. Aaron and Julianne certainly looked the parts. As for the production....superb. to do a live show of this magnitude was impressive. Bravo to the director and all the behind the scenes people.

If I wanted to see the movie Grease all I had to do is put on my DVD of Grease. Can I put on a DVD of the Broadway show of Grease? No I can't because it was never recorded on video. That's why I was so excited that they were doing Grease on TV and thought it would be like the Broadway show. Another thing. They wanted an audience, that's fine but did the audience have to yell and scream during the songs? What a disappointment. I gave the DVD 2 stars and that's for the cast. Everyone did a fine job singing and dancing. I was very suprirsed at Julianne Hough's singing. She was really good and Aaron Tveit did a good job as Danny, but he did seem a little too old for the part. I hope when they do Hairspray they do the Broadway version and not the movie version.

The script from the beginning always called for a more conflicted guy, and we didn't need to see another of Travolta's Vinnie Barbarino, however brilliant. Live's entire production and ensemble were opened up with a scale and energy off and on stage that is really astonishing. The original movie is iconic, but everything was smaller in concept and camera work to focus on Travolta. Live is more, and I hope appreciated for what it brilliantly achieved. Given the challenge, the sound mix didn't always benefit the singers. The DVD has interesting behind-the-scenes, and omits the ads that seemed to break the story and slow the pace. For those appreciative or critical of Tveit, I urge you to search the many You-Tubes available of concerts and snippets from film for magnetic acting and range in voice: Les Mis; Graceland, and more).

We were amazed that the choreography of shots and scenes went pretty smooth, even with the rain threat that evening. The standout for us was Vanessa Hudgens. We had no idea about her's father's passing, until after the show was over. She was amazing and one of the best Rizzos I can remember in some time.  All of the cast was really good, to be fair.

7533450,5,B017SWJZXU,"The Live broadcast of ""Grease"" was almost over before I remembered it was on.  What I caught - from just before the car race to the ending - hooked me.  Julianne Hough's Sandy is sprightly and yet innocent.  She registers every emotional shift at exactly the right way.  Vanessa Hudgens could not be a better Rizzo.  She sings ""There are worse thing"" so well, inflecting each thought with just the right pride and spunk.  Aaron Tveit has the unenviable job of portraying Danny Zucco - one of Travolta's best movie performances.  No worry for either gentleman.  Travolta's performance is still great, but Tveit has moments that surpass Travolta and a couple that don't.  The whole cast works wonders.  Janine Gastmeyer (Spelling?) from SNL steps into the Principal role with great ease.  The minor characters are more fleshed out here, to the advantage of the whole.  I could point out that the actors don't quite look teenage - Vanessa Hudgens' teen years in high school were well documented in High School Musical.  But the plus to that is dancing and singing ability on Broadway level.
The Live presentation of musicals was started by NBC.  Their Sound of Music was passable if controversial, while the Peter Pan was miscast in at least one or two crucial roles.  Fox has taken the high road and given us believable sets and costumes and superior direction all around.  Bravo to them.",1458000000,,1386,4.809322033898305

Grease Live crackles with sheer energy.  It thrills, it amazes, it surprises.  Its exuberant and its electrifying.  The scope of the production is absolutely mind-boggling, with its huge multiple sets.  My eyes practically popped out of my head watching this show, which is not remotely like anything Ive ever seen.

Every single person involved in the production from the directors, producers, stars, supporting actors, to the sound people, camera people, makeup and costume people, and all the rest gave 300%.

Until the night ""Grease Live"" aired...

It not only retained the magic and spirit of the movie and original Broadway musical, it had its own unique style that made it enjoyable & accessible for the current generation of young people who didn't grow up watching the original movie. There was not a single flaw in the production and everyone involved in front of and behind the camera did a spectacular job.

As for the DVD itself, having only 10 minutes of special features, which pretty much covers all aspects of the production in surprisingly informative 4-minute vignettes, was impressive enough for me.

7533481,5,B017SWJZXU,"The recent Network TV decision to air live musicals in the arid desert of endless cop shows and ""Reality TV"" has been one of the most exciting ideas, and FOX knocked it out of the park with GREASE LIVE! No one, of course, can ever remake the original Travolta/Newton-John movie, and this show doesn't try to. The writers, director, cast and crew made this THEIR OWN - some of it is familiar, some of it new, all of it spectacular. You can actually see that the cast was having a total blast with their performances. Ana Gasteyer ROCKED as the Principal, and it was awesome to see cameos of Barry Pearl (original Thunderbird Doody), and of Didi Conn (the original Frenchy) interacting with Carly Rae Jepsen (the new Frenchy). In a BRILLIANT move, ignoring the real world school segregation nonsense of the 50s, African American actors have been added to the cast - most notably as Pink Lady Marty (Keke Palmer) who sings a heartwarming song to The Troops, Coach Calhoun (Wendell Pierce) who marvelously succeeded Sid Caesar in the roll, and Principal McGee's absent-minded sidekick Blanche (Heneefah Wood) - which was the best fundamental script change of the whole show! Julianne Hough [Dancing With The Stars] was fantastic as Sandy and could have been Olivia Newton-John's own understudy. Kether Donohue was the perfect Pink Lady Jan, nearly channeling Jennifer Tilly for the part. Some of the original GREASE songs were performed out of the original sequence, and some new songs were added, creating a unique presentation and reinterpretation. I tevo'd GREASE LIVE! and watched it several times before the DVD was available. I'll be glad to own the DVD.",1456012800,3,1656,4.917857142857143

7533487,5,B017SWJZXU,"A fun and impressive performance considering there are no second takes. The writers made a few updates to the script that gave more depth to many of the characters. Some scenes were omitted, whether it be for time constraints, to make the show more friendly for a Cable-TV audience, or due to a director's decision. The show struck a good balance between remaining faithful to the original and refreshing the look for a new generation to enjoy.

The cast was diverse and there were some standout performances. Top marks go to Vanessa Hudgens for her portrayal of ""Rizzo"". Her solo of ""There Are Worse Things (I Could Do)"" was something to behold. Jordan Fisher and Carlos PenaVega also deserve a heap of praise for the jobs they did re-imagining ""Doody & Kenickie."" The two leads also fared well reprising two roles that were given iconic status by their predecessors.

This of course deviates from the film, fox described it as something of a marriage between the original stage production and the movie, and if you go in wanting the movie line for line, this isn't it.

But if you go in expecting a good time, some deviations and artistic liberties, this performance will be everything you could hope for. There are some minor things that aren't quite right, sometimes the instrumental drowns out the vocals, two of the singers are sometimes off key - I don't know their names, but the girl who plays Frenchie and the girl who sings Grease is the Word...

But in spite of a few sour notes and a 30 second sound lapse, you cannot deny the work put into this thing. While you're watching it, it's easy to forget it was done live, but keep it in mind as you see Danny's FIVE costume changes during Those Magic Changes. The acting, singing, and dancing was so great.

7533516,3,B017SWJZXU,"There is a long list of classic American musicals I had never seen or hadnt seen until the last few years.  One of those was Grease.  Id avoided it because of some of what Id heard about the storyline.  But I couldn't pass when I saw that Fox was joining the live musical bandwagon and producing Grease Live!  With people I am familiar with in the cast, I figured this was as good a time as any to watch the movie.  Sadly, it was pretty much exactly what I was expecting.

The musical takes up back to 1959 and tells the story of Sandy (Julianne Hough) and Danny (Aaron Tveit), high school seniors who had met the summer before on the beach.  They figure they are going their separate ways until Sandys family moves from Salt Lake City and she attends a new school, the school where Danny just happens to go.

Of course, they cant just get back together.  Sandys a good girl with strict parents.  Dannys a greaser.  Sandy makes friends with a group of girls lead by Rizzo (Vanessa Hudgens), who seems to have a bit of a crush on Danny.  Will their very different backgrounds keep them from making their relationship work in the real world?

I can certainly see the appeal of the musical.  Even today, 1950s nostalgia is strong, and it was certainly strong in the 1970s, when this musical was first written.  The music is fun, and the dancing is top notch.  This is an example of the best in the genre from that standpoint.

And NCB could learn a thing or two from the production here.  Yes, it was all done on soundstages live, but that didn't mean it was anything less than glorious.  The costumes and the sets were both wonderful.  The effects shots, pretty much reserved for a drag race late in the movie, were top notch.  This was a huge step up from the three NBC efforts.  There are also some awesome costume changes that compare to the best of Broadway.

Likewise, the acting was better.  Oh, Im not comparing it to any of the performances from the classic movie since Ive never seen that.  Again, Im comparing it to the NBC live shows weve gotten so far, which have featured acting that can be a bit stiff.  And it was a blast watching the cast, which included such people as Boys II Men, Carlos PanaVega, and even Eve Plumb as the female mechanics teacher at the school.  I felt everyone did a great job.

I think one different was the live audience, which gave the performers someone to react against.  Of course, it was a double edged sword when they used the audience as part of the action.  For some scenes it work, but for others, it left me scratching my head.  One scene in particular with two sets of bleachers on front lawn of the school springs immediately to mind in the head scratcher category.

No, my issues with the movie are more with the story.  First, theres the question of the timeline.  I guess the story takes place over the course of a school year, but it felt to me like maybe a month had passed at most.  Either I didn't follow the story as much as I thought I did or they weren't clear on the passage of time in this version.

But thats not nearly as big a deal to me as the moral of the story.  All the conflict goes away when Sandy changes herself and her values to match Dannys.  What relationship will last when you change that much for someone?  Whats even worse is that from the very beginning, Danny and his friends are shown as shallow teens who degrade women.  Trust me, they will not have a healthy relationship.  And we even get an object lesson in how they treat women with a storyline involving Rizzo.  Considering I hear Never change for a man preached to teenage women, Im surprised this is such a popular musical since it has the exact opposite moral.

So I guess Im one of the few who will never be a fan of this story.  For a new generation, this product is fun, but the moral keeps me from fully recommending Grease Live!",1454544000,,3875,4.337047353760446

While certainly not terrible,  I found it really lacking in energy.  The two leads were rather  bland.  Julianne  Hough is an unbelievable dancer - but acting is not quite the same for her, judged by this.  The edginess,  a certain darkness that this show should have was absent.  So was the humor.

7533522,5,B017SWJZXU,"I don't know why some people are so quick to trash Grease Live.  Grease is my favorite movie of all time.  Olivia Newton-John is my favorite singer of all time.  There is room for both the movie and the live production.  They are different takes and represent different eras.  Grease had the 1970s flavor of the 50s and Grease Live is a modern take of an ideal 50s.  I love musicals and I love the trend of live productions on TV.  The effort the cast and crew put into the Live production was stellar.  The production deserves Emmy consideration.  Vanessa Hudgens is worthy of an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Rizzo.  I enjoyed what the live production offered that the movie did not.  While the chemistry between John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John is untouchable, Julianne Hough did a nice job, and I'm now a huge fan of Aaron Tveit.  Loved him in Les Miserables as well.

7533526,5,B017SWJZXU,"Let me start off by saying....Aaron Tveit, who plays Danny Zuko, is so undeniably the star of the show. If you don't yet know who he is, you soon will, and, along with the rest of the world, won't be able to forget him ever after! He has the most unbelivable vocals but he's also very good-looking (to be frank, the man is smokin hot) and has so much charisma. He is, like no joke, basically the definition of perfection! I've been in such awe of Aaron Tveit enough as it is prior to watching him as Danny Zuko. He is just epically flawless in all aspects of his performances; he honestly is that rare form of a human that truly excels at everything he does! I loooved him in the show Graceland and was so bummed when they didn't renew it for a fourth season! (He was the majority reason for why I got hooked on watching it right from the start of Season 1 Episode 1). If you watch him in anything he's a part of, you will without a doubt see what I'm talking about. He has some sort of addictive and magical appeal to him that just draws you in and you can't manage take your eyes off him whenever watching him on-screen. He quickly will become your main reason for watching anything else he's credited in.
The whole cast of ""Grease: Live"" is right up there though as far as star quality goes. Julianne Hough (Sandy), Vanessa Hudgens (Rizzo), and Carlos PenaVega (Kenickie) are really great! Jordan Fisher (who played Doody) was a HUGE surprise for me since I hadn't known of him prior to seeing it. Fisher's performance is impeccable and his voice is so beautiful and sultry. (Really though.) Mark my words: You will wind up playing ""Those Magic Changes"" on repeat excessively after hearing it the first time around.
In its entirety, and despite the technical difficulties they encountered (it's a LIVE production, so it was super ballsy and already prone to experiencing some technical issues, but that's regardless), ""Grease: Live"" is no doubt a game-changer; it's an irreplaceable experience for all the senses. It's not a remake of Grease, it's a whole new doubled-down version...and they sort of have, in many ways, made/rewrote history. Trust me when I say, it deserves to be #1 on your list of shows to watch (or soundtracks to buy) as soon as you have the time, and it's definitely beyond worth that time!",1454371200,9,2315,4.54066985645933

7533529,3,B017SWJZXU,"IS FOX TV A SERIAL KILLER?
Last night FOX TV Network murdered a classic ""Grease"". They took a bunch of stars from The Disney Channel and Nickelodeon and produced a 3 hour Live episode of Glee. I am a purist and quite frankly, nothing can beat the original movie ""Grease"". I grew up with it and nothing will ever beat the stellar cast, musical performances or dance numbers. It was especially painful to watch Boys II Grandfathers massacre ""Beauty School Dropout"". Only Frankie Avalon could do justice to it. The new songs sucked and sounded more like they belonged in a Disney movie like Frozen. Though the cast was good, they paled in comparison to the original, all star cast of the movie. I have to admit, that Vanessa Hudgens(High School Musical) was incredible as Rizzo. Though she was certainly no Stockard Channing , I think she was the only actor that was truest to their character. There were many inconsistencies with history as well, like racial segregation in the 50's, hence why, keeping true to the times, ""Grease"" the movie, did not include any main black characters. Remember ""Hairspray""?, good example of staying historically accurate. It was a very lame attempt to try to recreate a classic by trying to make it seem like they were historically accurate, while updating it for today's audiences. The end result, was just plain unbelievable and insulting.
The musical numbers were really hard to believe either, as they too, were updated to sound less authentic like in the 50's, and more like today's pop crap. Joe Jonas had no business being anywhere in this production. It was painful to hear him murder ""Rock and Roll Is Here To Stay"" and other songs. I really hated that they omitted classics like ""It's Raining On Prom Night"" to replace it with new songs , that once again sounded like contemporary pop crap.

Jessie J, singing ""Grease Is The Word"" was bloody awful and pure sacrilege.

Haneefah Wood was terrible as Blanche, she certainly was no Dody Goodman.

It was a treat to see Didi Conn again, who played Frenchy in the movie ""Grease"" and did it much better. It was also fun to see The Brady Bunch's Eve Plum as the shop teacher Mrs. Murdock,. Though, I really missed Alice Ghostley in the original role.

All in all, I know a lot went into making a live event like that, so I give it an C for effort. This just goes to show that you really can't redo or remake a classic. I know that this was not a movie or a remake, and that ""Grease"" has been a play for decades, but it could and should have been better.

Leave it to FOX to murder another classic. Next up on their hit list is the remake of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The cast alone is enough to gag an elephant, so you know what to expect.

I guess you have to watch these things without expectation, bias or prejudice, but it's hard to see good classics you grew up with get massacred by sub par talent and teeny boppers.",1454284800,4,2911,4.524714828897339

But how could one really sit and truly appreciate it all with the screaming, talking, clapping, and constant background noise from the ""Live Audience"".

Then you have hundreds of idiots yelling and clapping at the beginning of every song, anticipating every entrance, during anything cool, etc.  How can the home audience appreciate the drums or stomps, dancing, etc., some singing you can't even hear because of this unnecessary audience.
If they're going to sell a DVD - take people's money -  they should film one without the live audience and the constant noise.  It's almost disrespectful to all the work the artists have put in, because their message isn't making it through the TV...through the chaotic frenzy of the 'live audience'.",1454284800,5,841,4.86013986013986

Hudgens was a surprise stand-out and, in fact, all the actors acquitted themselves well enough, but why didn't the producers go back to the source material, which is different from the movie version. I love the film, but this Live! production was only a thin carbon copy of that. Other than color-blind casting, there was nothing here to excite any real interest. If they're going to mount a new production, at least do it with a fresh perspective. All in all, an OK version, but I'll stick with the original.",1454284800,,765,4.7164179104477615
7533533,5,B017SWJZXU,I Loved it!!! Everyone did an amazing job! I MUST say Vanessa SLAYED it! What a trooper! Performing after the loss of her father! Incredible.,1454284800,,141,4.68
7533534,5,B017SWJZXU,"From Jessie J's electrifying ""Grease is the Word"" opening number, I was hooked! The movie holds a very special place in my heart and I must admit, I did not know what to expect from this live performance. But it was amazing! Vanessa Hudgins was a standout as Rizzo, especially with her heartbreaking rendition of ""There are Worse Things I Could Do"" and Julianne Hough channeled Olivia Newton John's Sandy beautifully and added her own incredible dancing skills to the role. I particularly liked the overall, energetic production that wove behind-the-scenes with actual scenes In a fresh and totally unique way.  What fun!  Bravo!",1454284800,,629,5.038461538461538

7533537,5,B017SWJZXU,"I loved it! I thought everyone did an amazing job. I went into it knowing that it would be hard to beat the original but as someone who has seen the play and the movie, I thought it was awesome. It's hard to say who did the best job because I thought they all did a great job. And I have to say that the behind the scenes people did a very good job too because it was to seamless from scene to scene. I really loved Jordan Fisher's part too. He has a great voice. Will re-watch over and over again.",1454284800,3,498,3.892156862745098
7533538,4,B017SWJZXU,"Loved this! Thoroughly impressed by the resilience of the actors, this had to be tough to pull off. Vanessa killed it as Rizzo and so did Aaron as Danny.",1454284800,,153,4.310344827586207
7533539,3,B017SWJZXU,"I was not enthused by the prospect of yet another play on TV. As an Olivia Newton-John fan, the 1978 movie version is the definitive version. I did not intend to watch Grease: Live, but got suckered into it by my niece. Other than Eve Plumb's performance as Mrs. Murdock and Kether Donohue's as Jan, the acting was mediocre, wooden, and, in some cases, a pale imitation lines delivered so much better by the actor from the movie. Plumb steals the show. Several times the music overwhelmed the singing. The stand out numbers were the Hand Jive scene, There Are Worse Things I Could Do, and the closing We Go Together. It was interesting the things they sanitized for this production while leaving other things in. Apparently, I am much too delicate to see Sandy with a cigarette, hear Rizzo sing ""fongol,"" or watch Danny run around the car with saran wrap... but I am not too delicate for all of the crotch thrusts and fake titty grabbing. I give this three out of five stars because of Plumb and Donohue. What was good about this could not rescue what was bad. I had more fun singing along to the songs in an attempt to irritate my niece than I did by the production itself.",1454284800,4,1174,4.465116279069767
7533540,5,B017SWJZXU,"Honestly, the movie version holds a special place in my heart, so I went into ""Grease Live!"" with VERY low expectations... I was hooked 10 minutes in, by the cast (lots of stand-out performances), sets (20+ acres of sets? On a live broadcast? Really!?), & costumes (some of those quick-changes had us hitting rewind to watch again). Just enough meta-jokes & sly one-liners, plus modern additions like Boyz II Men as Teen Angel(s) and the behind-the-scenes glimpses in the finale... Plus, cameos by the original Frenchie and Doody!! This was truly (and surprisingly) an enjoyable ride. Lots of hard work went into this production, obviously, and it paid off. Not perfect, but a 5-Star rating for being LIVE!!",1454284800,10,707,5.0
7533541,5,B017SWJZXU,"Loved the whole production!  The cast was outstanding and looks like they enjoyed every minute!  Julianne Hough was a great Sandy, and Vanessa Hudgins was even better as Rizzo-can't wait for the DVD!",1454284800,,199,5.0
7533542,4,B017SWJZXU,"Loved it!!! Of course, know the original inside and out and nice to see it was a bit different with many twists. Was familiar with a few of the actors, but Julianne Hough really won me over.  She's cute and did an awesome job. Very talented emsemble. Aloha~~~",1454284800,,259,4.395833333333333
7533543,5,B017SWJZXU,"I thought this was amazing!! ***note if you are expecting it to be just like the movie, it's not! This is live so unlike the movie, they only got 1 shot to record everything. With that being said, I think the live show was casted perfectly and my whole family fell in love with Aaron and Carlos.  It also looked like the show was set to film outside but it rained them out which made me even more impressing that all the cast had to redo everything they learned inside instead of outside. Vanessa also did a Fantastic job, her father passed hours before the show, I can't imagine doing this after such a traumatic event but she did and she nailed every bit.  Overall, awesome performance by an awesome cast!",1454284800,10,707,4.3893129770992365
7533544,3,B017SWJZXU,"There's a big elephant in the room no one seems willing to notice.  As someone who grew up in the 50's and a fan of the original B'way play, I was looking forward to this show.  Fact: Any form of interracial boy-girl relationship would not have been openly accepted during that era.  If they were so set on having a Black girl play Marty, they should have paired her with a Black boy and cast a Black guy in the role of Vince Fontaine.  Unless the producers' intention was to rewrite history (a common practice these days,) they should kiss off the suspension of disbelief.  The actors are all gifted and the performances tight, especially the ""Greased Lightning"" scene.  It's the best ever.",1454284800,7,691,4.5772357723577235
