7872337,5,6304473869,"As a teacher,I have been sharing this story with my fifth and sixth graders for years. It is clearly written and beautifully filmed. I find the story especially inspirational for children because it opens their eyes to the wonderful and completely unexpected adaptations animals make to their environment as it changes from forest to lake habitat.",1262044800,3,347,5.214285714285714
7872338,5,6304473869,"This video is a good intro into the life of the Amazon.  I enjoyed how it balances the strangeness appeal of different creatures in the jungle with the scientific rigour to explain the terrain and the different environments animals and plants face throughout the year (rainy flooded season, dry season, etc.)
I strongly recommend this video for someone planning to visit the Amazon for the first time, just to have an idea of what to expect and to better be able to understand the explanations guides may give during a trip.",1072483200,3,524,4.758241758241758
7872339,4,6304473869,This video is one of the best of National Geographic's video series.  It provides a lot of information about the Amazon basin wildlife and though I have seen it many times I still enjoy watching it.  It contains information on a wide assortment of creatures as well as the continuous cycle of flooding and draining the Amazon forest goes through.  It talks about all sorts of strange creatures that are very exotic and beautiful.  I like the way the information is presented as well as the fact that it is very scientifically accurate (I am a scientist).  I also like the fact that it closes by talking about how the forest is being changed through cutting the trees and building dams on the river.  It provides lots of information in a short period of time and gives a good rounded view at a land that is strange and different.,974246400,12,828,4.523489932885906
