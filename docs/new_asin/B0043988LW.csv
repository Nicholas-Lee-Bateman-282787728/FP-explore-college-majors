8414470,5,B0043988LW,"My (free) church music camp is designed to introduce young people ages 5 to 11 to classical music. After years of using the same materials (mostly Disney products), I was delighted to discover something new. The series entertains the kids and they respond sympathetically to the classical figures - both composers and instruments. They all know who Mozart and Beethoven are after the second session. I am very very pleased with the product and I assure you it is being put to very good and worthwhile use.",1373241600,2,505,4.816091954022989
