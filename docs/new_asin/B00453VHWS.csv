4262626,4,B00453VHWS,"I used to watch this show way back when it was on late night TV.  I'd program the VCR to record it (yeah, kids this was before Tivo/DVR) and watch it the next day.  Years later, I caught the two movies it was based off of; I liked the series better.

The show was an odd little mix of Mission Impossible, MacGyver, and your run of the mill detective show.  The budgets weren't all that great, but the show was very amusing.  The main star was a very likeable fellow and the leading lady was good and some nice eye candy.  It's not fine art or anything, but I think you'll enjoy it.  I might also suggest&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Stairway-to-Heaven/dp/B004FN1QUG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow: Stairway to Heaven</a>&nbsp;as another series that probably shouldn't have been good, but was.

I have only two real problems.  One, it's a bit expensive for a series nowadays, but eh it's what the market will bare I suppose.  Very hard to find the show anywhere else and even on an auction sites, the best I could find was 1/3 more expensive.  Can't really count it down for that, but it's a consideration if you're deciding whether to get the set.

The other more pressing problem, the DVD case was apparently designed by a blind monkey.  It's nearly guaranteed you will scratch your DVDs at least a little taking them in and out and one of the discs had shaken loose and received minor scratches when I opened mine.  We're not talking anything that should stop playback, my computer verified all the discs readable so I'm not worried about it, but you may want to consider alternative packaging if you'll be taking them in and out frequently.",1383436800,2,1703,4.888501742160279
4262627,5,B00453VHWS,I loved this show when it came out on TV all those many years ago. I loved the fact that the main plot points revolve around righting wrongs and friendship as well as the child like joy that Rawly gets from his work.,1372032000,,216,4.046511627906977
4262628,4,B00453VHWS,"Formatted in stretch making everyone look wider, especially the very attractive and shapely Christina Cox. Also a bit pricey for a DVD. But i enjoy this show.",1363910400,,158,4.888888888888889
4262629,5,B00453VHWS,The first season of F/X: The Series was hard to find until Amazon finally made it available.  My understanding is that it was initially released in Canada but it had not made it's way to the US.  The second season of FX has been available via Amazon in the US for while now.  When I finally found season one through Amazon I took the chance that it would be a high quality DVD - and it is.  Very happy that I found this hard to find set and am happy with the results.,1356307200,,467,3.989247311827957

8416485,4,B00453VHWS,"I enjoyed the show back then.  Though it can seem a bit dated in places, I still like watching it.  The transfer to DVD could have been better, but that happens sometimes with shows from the 1990s.

Daddo, Dobson and Cox make this show work, with some help from Carrie Anne Moss.  The actors' strong chemistry helps with the average to very good writing.  The production values are decent.",1427241600,,389,4.579710144927536
8416486,5,B00453VHWS,One of my favorite TV series....Its a shame they stopped it soooo early. would have loved to see more.,1405641600,,102,4.421052631578948
8416487,5,B00453VHWS,"They need to change the actors for the detective and Riley, otherwise the base storyline is fantastic !!",1404000000,,104,4.833333333333333
8416488,2,B00453VHWS,"It is nothing close to the movie version.  It is an okay movie which you can show it to TV, while paying attention to someone at the same time, and you miss nothing.",1399593600,,165,4.0
8416489,1,B00453VHWS,I cannot really review the show itself because I had to return it as the very first disk was bad.  The pilot was 10 chapters and in about chapter 7 it started to freeze and finally stopped completely.  I tried going in again and skipping the chapter but it would freeze before it would go into any of the final chapter - this was on a Blue Ray player so I tried it on a DVD/VCR player I have and same problem.  So I never got to see the end and didn't bother watching any of the other episodes.  Hopefully other copies they are selling don't have this problem and others who buy can watch the entire pilot (let me know how it ended).,1394064000,,633,4.080645161290323
8416490,5,B00453VHWS,"No issue with ordering, packaging, or delivery.  All 22 episodes of Season 1 are on the disks.  However, it is confusing to be missing Disk 4 (at least by the disk labels).  I started to return the set because of the missing disk, but a check of the episode titles confirmed that the disk set does contain the complete Season 1.",1392940800,,328,4.344262295081967
8416491,5,B00453VHWS,"When framed for murder the ""hero"" has to use all his FX tricks to prove his innocence. Great use of suspense and make-up and make-believe to solve crimes.",1391558400,,154,4.535714285714286
