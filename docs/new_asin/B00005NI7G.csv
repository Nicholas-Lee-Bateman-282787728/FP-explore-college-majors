1635437,5,B00005NI7G,"Augustus was the big man. He ruled with an iron fist. The majority of his successors were failures. There is a story in the second chapter that is very interesting. It is the story of Sejanus. He was a political gangster who wielded power during the reign of the emperor Tiberius. I love to hear the stories of political intrigues during ancient history. The first chapter is good, but too much about some poet. Who cares about ancient poetry, I want more blood and guts stories. Another great story is of a General named Germanicus. He was like JFK. This dvd is worth a watch for sure if you like roman history.",1180310400,2,612,4.473214285714286
1635438,1,B00005NI7G,"While others have done a decent job in describing how terrible this documentary is and how much better PBS could have done producing it, what added to my surprise apart from the poor work of scholarship, were the comments made about Jesus. Karen King, a self proclaimed expert on the history of ancient Christianity narrated a couple of incidents and attributed them to the blessed life of Jesus. Later she goes on to say that those events rightly led to the crucifixion of Jesus by the Romans. I found that rather nonsensical.

Also, a great deal of time was spent narrating obscene verses from the collections of Ovid which I wonder why were found to be more relevant to the Roman Empire as compared to the political turmoil Rome was in or the military expeditions of her generals. Quite frankly, I had never imagined a PBS documentary would have disappointed me more.",1163116800,12,870,4.723684210526316
1635439,3,B00005NI7G,"i was REALLY looking forward to see this video.

i had downloaded somewhere,what i first believed to be an audiobook about The Roman Empire. Then to my exitement i found out that it was the audio track from this DVD.

I ordered it,and i was sadely dissapointed.

The video i imagined in my head,when listening to the audio track was FAR from reality.

The video part i made without drama,without action...without actors/acting in the true sense. Just more like ""background""  video. It truly did NOT add upp to the marvelous audio part.

Its not that i am saying ""Do NOT buy this DVD"" its more like saying don't look,just listen. Because the Audio track is perfect. From Sigourney Weaver's cool and sensitive telling,to the actors playing the part as the storry about the Roman Empire,unfolds.

So 2 Stars for the Video part. 5 Stars for the Audio",1142294400,,846,4.714285714285714
1635440,1,B00005NI7G,"This company will rip you off. I ordered this DVD and they never delivered it claiming they were waiting for it to arrive (like WTF!?).

1635441,3,B00005NI7G,"First, let me say that I have been satisfied and impressed with many PBS historical documentaries, as I have accumulated quite a collection over the years to present to my high school classes; but I was sorely disappointed with this one.  More attention was payed to Ovid and his encouragement of adultery than was to Jesus, the man who affected this world more than any other person who has ever lived.",1126310400,10,403,4.676056338028169
1635442,2,B00005NI7G,"I love the PBS EMPIRE series... but this one just bored me to death.  Something about it that I cannot put my finger on just came off so badly.  Perhaps it was Sigourney's delivery, perhaps it was that periodic stupid ""Circus Music"", perhaps it was the same stupid footage over and over again... I just don't know.  In whata we know was a bustling world of people... this thing felt so lonely and bereft of visual stimulation or charts.  I thought it would be enthralling.  The subject is so broad and could pack way more of a punch than say a documentary on one man like Napoleon... yet ""Napoleon"" in the Empire series is superbly done.  It's almost as if they have no top quality control over this ""Empire"" series... very hit and miss.

Hate to say it, but I've seen ""The Greeks"", ""Martin Luther"", Napoleon"", ""Islam"", ""Peter & Paul""... and ""ROME"" is the worst one.  What a shame.  It had more potential to be better than any of them.

I think all I have to go is the MEDICI, EGYPT, JAPAN and SOLOMON... but I cannot imagine they will disappoint to the same degree as this one.",1118620800,5,1078,4.398989898989899
1635443,2,B00005NI7G,"I was shocked at how bad this film was, no real information just fluff and stuff.  I have numerous historical DVDs but this one will be going on the bottom shelf.",1089244800,,162,4.225806451612903
1635444,5,B00005NI7G,"I couldn't help but notice the negative attention surrounding this video. I saw this on PBS and eventually got a copy for myself. It is one of my favorite documentaries on Rome at present.
The Hail Caesar collection, by A&E, had always been my favorite but after seeing this PBS series several times I came to have a greater appreciation for it. The narration may seem monotone but I find it blends well with the atmosphere of the film.  A documentary relies on images, and stills very heavily and this one is no different. It is because of this fact that the slow and methodical tone Ms. Weaver uses allows you to slip back into the past and enjoy a perspective that may be different than you'd expect.
I am a student of Roman history and I think that what PBS created here is excellent. And especially since they are writing for a broad audience and not just specialized historians who already know all of the events covered in the documentary.
Given the fact that this is put on PUBLIC television and it is not a required coure for Roman History I believe it deserves at least 4 stars. I give it 5 because of the harsh criticism it has received to this point.
I recommend this video/DVD to anyone with an interest in history, politics, poetry or just simple novel story telling. It is a fun journey that can be enjoyed many times over. I have personally seen it in its entirety at least 6 times.",1034380800,109,1398,4.439688715953308
1635445,2,B00005NI7G,"Unfortunately, television history tends to overlook and oversimplify events. That is what happens with ""The Roman Empire in the First Century."" The writers have managed to make the dramatic events that shaped Rome appear boring, and are treated with little care for facts in many cases. The emperor Nero is hardly explored as to his personality (the greatest detail given over to the murder of his mother)and Claudius is skirted over as if his only purpose was to place Nero in the succession.
Granted, it is difficult to put 100 years of such important events into a four hour program but I find it difficult to understand how such a pivotal year as 69 CE is reduced to a footnote with the empire going with little pause from Nero to Vespasian! It is as if Galba, Otho and Vitellius had never existed let alone been emperors of the Roman Empire. The program focuses on the views of Seneca and Pliny the Younger but does not provide much about their motives for cooperating with tyrants or much on their backgrounds. We are informed that Seneca was exiled at the whim of a tyrant (Claudius) but not told that he was probably involved in a conspiracy with Claudius's niece, Julia. Similarly, Pliny prospered under Domitian but after he was assassinated he turned to blackening his character.
The experts who are interviewed for the program are certainly qualified to discuss their subjects but I have always wondered why someone like Barbara Levick, who as the author of biographies of Claudius and Vespasian, (or especially Michael Grant)would be invaluable. Sygorney Weaver, a great actress, reads the script at a monotonous pace.
In short, if you want to understand The Roman Empire in the first century, buy books at Amazon and not this video.",996364800,130,1746,4.842809364548495
1635446,3,B00005NI7G,"I watched this on PBS.  This could have been much, much better than it was.  The documentary was at its best when reading from contemporary texts like the letters of Ovid or Pliny.  It was at its worst during the narration.  Sigourney Weaver narrated in a slow, utterly unvarying monotone, as though reading her lines for the first time and trying not to mispronounce any of the words.  It is hard to blame her, since the script that she read from sounded like it was lifted directly from an uninspired junior-high history textbook.  It would have been so much better had the narration consisted of reading at length from Tacitus or Suetonius, both of which exist in extremely entertaining English translations.
The pictures were good, and the selections from Ovid, Pliny, and Seneca were very fine.  The title is a little deceptive, as it covers the period only to the death of Vespasian, the year 79, other than a brief mention of the ascension of Trajan.  This wasn't bad, but really could have been much better.",996364800,31,1015,4.7272727272727275

1635455,2,B00005NI7G,"Really great photography and narration by Sigorney Weaver. Also really interesting thread weaving together the story of Ovid and Augustus' daughter Julia.

However, this documentary probably tries to do too much and there's very little context for how the described events fit into the Roman world or their impact on the trajectory of Roman history. I'm also not sure who the audience is as it's a little to thin on details for an informed reader of history, probably too boring for a younger audience, and too schizophrenic and focused on random tidbits of Roman sexuality to make it appropriate for a middle school or high school classroom... I can hear the phones ringing with concerned parents now.",1485648000,,702,5.0

1635605,4,B00005NI7G,"The main strength of this program is that rather than approach the story of the Roman Empire from the perspective of battles and conquests, it approaches it more as a chronicle of the lives of Rome's rulers. Not that big of a deal when they cover Caesar, Augustus, Caligula, or Nero, because there are a good number of entertaining and relatively informative documentaries about these guys. Trying to find one about the life of Tiberius is very, very frustrating.

This PBS series is unique in the amount of time spent on Tiberius, the most relatable emperor of his dynasty. Sure, it's only about 15 minutes or so, but that's like 13 minutes more than other programs seem to give him.

My only complaint is that once Nero died, the program seemed to lose its momentum. I think it's because the end of the First Century feels like such an arbitrary stopping place. Considering that the empire continues for another like 400 years in the west and longer in the east, I think that this had the potential to be a much better series than it ultimately was. Had they stopped at the death of Nero, it would have made more sense as a series about the reign of the Julio-Claudians. Had they continued to the decline or fall of the weat, it also would have made sense as a series about the glory days of the western empire. The decision to continue to the end of the First Century, for me, detracted from the coherence of the premise as a whole.

However, that was such a minor issue compared to how enjoyable the program was overall.",1464652800,3,1524,4.5144927536231885

Also, I noticed that Christianity wasn't respected like other religions - why does this seem to be the case so often? A Harvard professor states that the Romans thought they had rightly convicted Jesus of being a ""rabble rouser"" and ""understood"" that the Christians were twisting the facts because they were ""used to political subversion"". Actually, there are alternate accounts: In some, the Sanhedrin insisted Jesus be convicted, not the Romans. In others, Jesus was convicted of claiming to be the ""King of the Jews"", which was treason in the Roman Empire. Anyway, I wish so much had not been skipped over, and that the series was fact-checked a little more carefully before being edited. Still, interesting documentary.",1450656000,,829,5.148148148148148

It was not really even on the radar until the end of the century.  The main theme that I see about Rome was its inherent distrust of corrupt kings and despots and then suddenly out of nowhere, an embrace of autocracy.  It did spend more time on some important women  but it fawned over them a bit too much.

The rise of Christianity was grossly summed up and then put down as nothing more than a rebellion against the Romans. The sacrifice of the early Christian martyrs was poo-pooed as nothing.

A lot of Nero's atrocities were cut out. He just to force people to listen to badly played concerts featuring himself for hours on end. He allegedly killed his pregnant wife then replaced her with a male slave who reminded him of her. He used to travel the empire and play his horrible songs and race his chariots. He had two or three attempts to kill his mother that weren't all mentioned. If you want a better history read I, Claudius and Paul Meyers' book The Flames of Rome.",1434758400,,833,4.409090909090909

The history is very interesting but keep in mind this is a documentary with limited time available.  Deep scholarly research, while represented, isn't the focus - it is an overview of the period which provides a good sampling of the historical facts and the mindset of the people and rulers of the period.

The only negative comment is that, while the narration is fine and the filming is beautiful, the repeated video images do become somewhat tiring.  Of course, it is a difficult task to provide visuals of the inhabitants of the long gone Roman Empire so it is a challenge to visually document this epic period without repetition of some images.

I've heard all this information many times but this program had an ingenious method. I suppose you could call it an adaptation of the KISS (Keep it Simple Stupid) method. A fairly brief period of time involving just a few characters. This distilled all the information down to a simple-to-understand chronology that made so much I've read before finally clear to me.
Certainly, there is much more information to be learned if you wish and many great sources where you'll find it. This program is more of a primer but is the best kick-off of a study I've ever seen.

The portrayal of life and politics of Rome at the time is pretty consistent with other historical sources, but dramatized in places and played down in others.

Much more time and effort should have been given to the destruction of the Jerusalem and the Temple at AD70. If not careful the viewer could have missed the event. More focus was given to Josephus than what he wrote about. A lot of attention was given to Seneca, yet another greek philosopher.

1636055,3,B00005NI7G,"I enjoyed it until they started to talk about jesus, treating him like he was just an ordinary rabble rouser, a threat to the roman empire, this was a lie, Jesus was prophesized to appear at that time, john the baptizer was aware of the scriptures, so were the religious leaders. in fact they were in anticipating  Jesus that is why they kept asking every prophet they seen is this perhaps the Christ? also Jesus was speaking many times in symbolism and illustration as per the prophecy in psalms. when and where he would be born was recorded in danial written hundreds of years in the past,  even what he would do, over 300 propheices pertained to Jesus way before he was even born,  also the people and apostles seen the miracles Jesus did, he even raised someone who had been dead and buried for four days. many witnesses seen him to these things, he spoke as a man with authority he knew the scriptures better than anyone.  when Jesus gave the man this advice let the dead bury their dead come follow me he was talking to a son whose father had not died yet. otherwise he would not have been there talking to jesus,  being dead can be symbolic in alive yet not living, spiritually dead, mentally out of it, or dead, also Jesus was speaking about a heavenly kingdom that would solve mans problems in the future, the reason many of the religious leaders hated him was because they were hoping the messiah would free them right away from the romans and their heavy taxes. when he was murdered unjustly, (as per prophecy in the psalms, genesis, and others scriptures) he was resurrected and spoke to many sometimes up to five hundred people at one time. there were thousands of witnesses to his being alive, and after 40 days Jesus left instructions to the apostles and they seen him as he ascended to heaven being caught by a cloud (that is cloud of invisiblity) that is why they could be so zealous for this kingdom and why despite all attempts at destroying it or oppressing it out of existence it grew. but another prophecy had to be fulfilled that would extend into the future, that was the death of apostles would lead to apostacy (weeds and wheat growing together illustration) until the conclusion of the system of things (our day) so please if your going to incorporate Jehovahs word purposes and his son please get the facts before you spout off half truths and fabricated explanations that are incorrect. thanks.  by doing this you have discredited the whole documentary.",1410480000,,2482,4.604072398190045

1636127,4,B00005NI7G,"Despite its shortcomings, this PBS entry into the subject of Roman Imperial history is worth a look.  There are so few documentaries devoted to this subject and many of them are not very good.  This one is above average although certainly not excellent by any means.

The focus is on the imperial biographies of the emperors in the First Century of the Roman empire with emphasis on the first five Julio-Claudian emperors (Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero).  The narrative is interspersed with interesting sidebars discussing various aspects of Roman culture (e.g, the baths, changing society as seen through personal letters, etc.).  Mention is made of Christianity although unlike most documentaries of this type this subject does not dominate the narrative nor should it.  Although some interesting sound bites are given regarding Jesus and his career, the documentary offers without questioning it the old census narrative that supposedly caused Joseph and Mary to 'go to the place of their births.'  It has long been determined that the idea that the Roman government would compel their subjects to travel back to the places of their births leaving their taxable property behind for the purpose of a tax review (census) is ludicrous.  The Romans were interested in where their subjects were living at the time of the tax census not where they originally came from.  This is one of many oversimplifications that the documentary is guilty of.  If the purpose of the program was to present Roman history, then a more accurate discussion of how the empire conducted a census should have been attempted.

The shortcomings of the documentary are sometimes due to the apparent time constraints that the producers were under (so much information and only so much time in which to present it).  At other times, the attempt at scholarship fails and incomplete and/or erroneous information is provided.  The discussion of Caligula's reign could have been better.  He is dismissed as insane (mention of his legions gathering seashells on the northern coast of France is offered as evidence) despite the fact that his reign and his personality, while distinctly unpleasant, were nuanced.  The seashell episode, for example, could very well be attributed to Caligula's attempt to humiliate the legions involved.  They apparently had played a part in an abortive coup against him in 39 AD (that of Gaetulicus) and Caligula was notorious for his vindictive nature.  However, as a plus, the documentary did discuss Philo's embassy to the emperor which most previous documentaries of this type never mention.  The civil war following the death of Nero omits all mention of Galba, Otho or Vitellius, the three emperors who fought over the throne from 68 to 69.  Since the emphasis of the documentary seems to be a discussion of the personalities and the rule of the emperors of the first century, omission of a discussion of these three eccentrics was a poor judgment choice on the part of the producers.  The reign of Titus is omitted altogether and the discussion of Domitian is severely limited although he ruled for fifteen years.

Despite the criticisms I've made, I found the DVD generally enjoyable.  Some of the discussions presented were informative and provided details not readily available in other programs of this type on this subject.  It is unfortunate that the producers were not inclined to present further programs on the second, third and fourth centuries of the empire.",1404604800,5,3491,5.128975265017668

I found this to be anything but dry.  The erudition of those who put these programs together took solid scholarship.  Deeply moving accounts and personal observations of daily life and the conditions of slavery and servitude for the vast populations under despotic and sometimes nearly refreshing periods of near democratic attitudes are given.  The one thing to remember is that Rome never ceased being a military dictatorship form the death of Augustine onward even under Claudius the firm grip of military control characterized the Empire ~ much like Amerika today in truth though it is rarely if ever admitted publicly by anyone in the civil government or its machinery!,1400716800,,849,5.266666666666667

Sticks to the basics, but in a way that doesn't come off as too dry or repetitive.

Bottom line: Those with a passion for all things Roman will probably not hear anything they didn't know before, but also won't be disappointed with PBS's upbeat and informative take on the major events of the era.

Let's be honest, if you love the Roman Empire, basically any documentary that interviews qualified experts and has somewhat decent visuals will captivate you.  This one will not let you down.",1400284800,,580,4.77

It was really interesting to see how the 1st Century laid a foundation for the Empire to come.  The practice of adopting the best candidate for the position seemed to work much better than the family heir.  It was interesting to see how dynamic and fragile the Roman Empire was.",1399075200,,419,4.473684210526316

This documentary covers a very big subject, the first 100 years of the Roman Empire in the new millennium. If you care, you'll be amazed how short of a time is spent on each Emperor and on the period of their reign. It spends more time on Judea then it merits and a whole lot less time on a much more important place like Egypt or say, the so called barbarian north. All in all, it's interesting enough, but for anyone well versed in this subject, a bit frustrating.",1397692800,,556,4.205607476635514

Admittedly. it is impossible to include everything unless you wanted a series that lasted for days rather than a few hours.
  That being said, I think this is a.very very good series for those unititated into Roman history. It hits on the top basics and I think very well produced.

1636229,2,B00005NI7G,"I heard things in this documentary I've never heard before and that interested me in the beginning. I was wondering where they got some of their information because I know a lot about Roman history in general from college, some was taken from the historian Josephius but others seem to be questionable. It wasn't until they reached the period of Christianity that I was floored. I realize this was a historical documentary and I took it as such, it was not a religious documentary. But the difference in the sympathetic feelings towards other religious sects that the Romans persecuted and the obvious contempt for Christianity is almost bewildering. It was so hard not to be extremely offended as a Christian even for a historical documentary. Karen King who teaches at Harvard was without a doubt the worst historian I've ever heard. She brought up a couple New Testament passages and then said Jesus got what he deserved. For instance she says ""A young follower came to follow Jesus but said he had to bury his parents first, Jesus would not allow this and said let the dead bury the dead."" What???? I'm fascinated by any history from this era since so little is known but Karen King's obvious resentment towards Christianity made me question the veracity of the whole documentary. I was really disappointed to know this garbage was aired on PBS. Can you imagine if the same was said about Mohammed or Abraham? I hate that they ruined the documentary with such utter nonsense. Regardless of what Ms. King thinks of Jesus our world was changed forever historically and religiously by His words. I think his message was a very good one even if most people, even Christians can't seem to follow them at times- myself included.",1381449600,2,1726,4.795302013422819

1636236,1,B00005NI7G,"Any historian worth his weight knows that during the Roman Empire, the Romans ruled Judea. During that time, the Jews, who were under Roman rule, threatened to riot if the Romans didn't execute Jesus. At first, Pontius Pilate refused. When faced with a mass riot by the Jews, which was the last thing Rome needed at the time, Pontius Pilate ""washed his hands"" of the whole mess and gave the JEWS permission to do what they wanted, The Jews then used Roman executioners to kill Jesus. Jesus was killed because the Jews demanded it. TWICE in this documentary, when the killing of Christ was mentioned, it is stated that the Romans killed Jesus. The JEWS killed Jesus and in the last 50 years the media continuously lies about who killed Jesus. So much so, that this lie prompted Mel Gibson to make the movie ""The Passion of the Christ"" which tells the true story of who killed Christ. I remember when he was making that film, the Hollywood moguls would NOT let him make it in Hollywood. He used his own money and made the film anyway. I also remember people of Jewish background picketing movie theatres because they were so against the film. The film shows the facts. Jesus, who was Jewish, claimed he was the Messiah. He was around for 33 years. Only when he went into the Jewish temples and threw tables over and told the Jews that they were living in sin for the business practices going on in the temples (borrowing and lending money etc.) did they want him dead. They demanded it of the Romans, Pilate looked the other way to avoid a riot (washed his hands of the whole mess as the Bible states) and allowed the Jews to kill Jesus. There are many other incorrect ""facts"" and outright lies in this documentary, but the two instances where they state that the Romans condemned Jesus to death, are pathetic lies and re-writing of history.",1377302400,2,1839,4.5589123867069485

1636247,2,B00005NI7G,"Overall, an interesting, if somewhat slow and plodding, historical overview of the Roman Empire in their first 100 years. Unfortunately, the highly questionable historical overview of the rise of Christianity (by Karen King in the video)... she is professor at Harvard in a very prestigious chair, and yet I have serious misgivings by the tenor of her short overview of how Christianity (specifically Jesus) came to ""power."" According to King, Jesus rose to prominesne when he joined a band of outsiders and discontents that were against the Roman government. Then the Government arresting him for causing trouble and ""rightly"" put him to death for these charges since he was committed to stirring up the masses against Rome. She quotes passages about ""turning father against son, mother against daughter"" as support for this idea, even though this is clearly not ""rise up against the government talk.""

Actually, Jesus prevented his disciples from rising up against the Roman ruling authority. It was the Sadducees and Pharisees ruling elite that wanted Jesus removed for his teaching about Kingdom ethics and the Good news. The Romans (Pontius Pilate) found nothing to support sedition charges. So, to make a claim (so quickly, with such weak support) to the contrary to leave the impression that practically no New Testament scholar would support, that seems less than ideal. It seems weak and it is disappointing. Obviously, she doesn't think much of Christianity. Fine. But this was not her best avenue to say that. (In see in a Google Search, that the Harvard Review (from her own school) has pulled a plan series of articles from her for publication. That is nearly unheard of, so perhaps she is being called on weak scholarship unbefitting an institution such as Harvard. Regardless, King's brief work on this video was a poor effort on her part. And quite frankly, I blame the producers and directors, two ladies: Lyn Goldfarb and Margaret Koval. They shouldn't have allowed this type of hit and run attack in a supposedly historically accurate production. Now, I would support them if they said something like, Some recent scholars have advanced the idea that it was Jesus himself who lead a band of seditious rebels that were then rightly judged and convicted to death. Here is one such scholar, Karen King. As long as they also indicated that most scholars would take the very opposite position. See, the problem there is that it isn't the place in this type of documentary to do that level of debate, so I just have to think that the producers, Lyn and Margaret, were woefully out of line here.

In addition, Karen claims that early disciples simply used this rightful execution to start a rebellion against Rome by claiming the person that they had just killed was the Son of God. .... and that Rome could very easily understand that motivation, Karen says with a smirk. I don't know what her motivation is, but that is probably the least probable scenario I could imagine. The disciples were scattered and denying that the even knew Jesus... it isn't until after the resurrection that they believe that He is more than a mere man. And when they come to that conclusion, they do nothing to lead a rebellion against Rome. There is no mention of this later on when the Romans wage war against the Jewish people for actual insurrections. Again, just shotty scholarship, very poorly produced. Extrememly bad editorial decision making.

Strangely... and this again goes against Lyn Goldfarb and Margaret Koval... later in the historical coverage (in a different ""show"" taping) it is a section on Greek philosophy of Stoicism. They are covering it fairly well and then they say how Seneca was concerned about teaching about brotherly love and care for others. Then they add (n the very next phrase)""years before Christians came up with the idea."" What!? What was that for? They weren't even mentioning Christians... but now, when they are talking about Greek Philosophy, the producers feel it necessary to say that their philosophy of love came years before the Christians??? Why?

Now, if that weren't ridiculous on its own merit, consider one small point about this: The concept to love your neighbor as yourself is actually a Jewish command that was in circulation years before Stoicism was formulated. So, the one-off stab at ""stoicism is better"" seems really empty when one considers it was a Jewish concept that was simply brought over to Christian ethics. Either way, however, who cares who was first!? Just seems like the production and direction was really weak and that somebody in the production / directing leadership thought it perfectly fine to take some stabs at Christianity, regardless of the accuracy. Or so it seemed to me.

There was also some needless stabs at Roman men (that just seemed oddly placed) and a whole lot of lauding of Roman women. Here, I can certainly understand that women need their due. I really liked hearing about the women in their historical context.

Overall, I think that Lyn Goldfarb and Margaret Koval hurt their own effort to produce a quality, engaging historical documentary due to these choices and perhaps their own philosophical leanings. Everyone has their ""leanings"" but most are clever enough to balance those ideas so that they don't become hurtful to their stated goal.

Anyway, at least the documentary did not cast Pilatus as a person who had qualms about executing someone. In fact, Pilatus as prefect had a history of antagonizing the Jews just to stir them up. For example, he refused to order the legions not to display one of the emperor's ensigns (which had idolatrous connotations for the Jews) when they entered Jerusalem. Another time Pilatus used Temple funds set aside for sacrifices and Temple upkeep to build an aqueduct -- a major Torah prohibition. When a crowd went to Pilatus to protest this egregious misuse of Temple funds, soldiers disguised as civilians proceeded to beat the Jews to stop them from protesting.

The documentary gives the impression that Pilatus was recalled to Rome for the execution of Jesus. Actually, he was ordered back by Vitellius, the legate of Syria for his lack of ""people skills."" The summation of multiple incidences of antagonism directed toward the Jews (as recorded by Josephus) plus an incident in which armed Samaritans were climbing Mt. Gerizim and Pilatus perceiving it as an attempted rebellion was enough to end his career as prefect of Judea.

In short, unlike his benign, kindly, characterization in Christian texts, Pilatus was actually a mean-spirited screw-up.",1340496000,12,1530,5.136546184738956

If one is an expert in this period you will be disappointed.  For those interested in a nice introduction to this period, this program is fine.  I found it reasonably balanced.

As a longtime documentary fan and as someone who is fascinated by the Roman Empire, I found this to be one of the most intelligent treatments I have seen on the subject. Yes, the scenes they have staged as background to the narrative are simple (and beautifully filmed and scored I would add). But if you were looking for ""Gladiator"" with multi-million dollar special effects then yes you will be disappointed. To the reviewer who suggests that we read a book on the subject to get the whole story, sure, how about Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire? That's only six volumes. Why not get a Ph. D. in classical studies while you're at it? A video documentary isn't a book and shouldn't be compared to one. I will agree that there hasn't yet been a documentary made about Rome that is equal to the subject, but for now this is a worthy entry.
I especially liked the focus on the private lives of the ancient Romans, such as the letters written by wives of soldiers stationed on Hadrian's Wall. The passages they included by ancient authors are the only firsthand accounts we have of the Roman world and I appreciated them. I thought Sigourney Weaver's narration was just fine.

Professional historians require more than fanciful legend to claim events of history are accurate and factual. There are no substantiating documents or archeological evidences outside of the bible for the actual existence of the character of Jesus as written in the self-contradicting gospels of the New Testament of the bible. There is plenty evidence for many savior cults springing up at the time, one which was a favorite of Rome that was the cult of Mithra. Much of the Mithra cult's rites were later incorported into the Roman Catholic religion. It was centuries before one of these Christ cults drew favor over the others and became politically allied with Constantine probably through Helena's, his mother, adoption of it. The early so-called christian cults were extremely diverse and combative with each other. It took the political and military might of the empire to force the population to adopt and adhere to this new ""official faith"" which it concocted and modified, with the consent of the power hungry priests, to embody what the empire desired most - a new means of controlling the minds and intimate lives of the populations it ruled. This program is not a documentary of facts which are substantiated in evidence, but one of legend which far too many have taken as fact through blind indoctrination. It's like watching a documentary on the legend of King Arthur and believing all those tales to be accurate fact when we know that there is no credible evidence for such a king or Camelot to ever have existed. Remember the story goes that King Arthur will return when England needs him. His legend also follows the common savior storylines. My point is that unless a program can provide valid evidence for what it presents as fact, it cannot be in anyway considered an historical documentary.  Therefore, if you care about truth and fact, this program does not present such. It is a cobbled production of select historical facts with unsubstantiated legend.",1324771200,38,2296,4.979166666666667
1636272,4,B00005NI7G,"I thought the documentary was very well done. However, the historian who said that Jesus was rightly condemned by the Romans for ""disturbing the peace"" is inaccurate. The Roman Proconsul Pilate should not have judged a religious matter of the Jews. By Roman law, he could not have executed someone for religious reasons because the Jews had been granted religious autonomy some years before.  This meant that Jewish leaders in Jerusalem had jurisdiction over religious matters and law, not the Romans. Romans could only intervene if the crime committed were capital or against the empire itself. There were, in fact, no legal reasons for Jesus to have been put to death by the Romans.",1321747200,6,684,5.0
1636273,5,B00005NI7G,It shows the history of Rome. This movie is great if you are studing the topic or simply want to know more about it. It will help you understand how Rome became an Empire.,1320019200,3,171,4.0588235294117645
1636274,5,B00005NI7G,"My only critique of these two episodes on the Roman empire was that there wasn't a whole lot to ""watch"" but that didn't bother me in the slightest since I basically hit the play button and just listened to it as I worked in another computer program.

I found this documentary very enjoyable.  I'm no Roman historian and don't want to critic the accuracy of facts or anything like that.  I found it to be a fun and interesting review of the empire, the personalities of the various Emperors, and even some of the Roman culture of the lower citizens (who, from the documentary aren't that lowly, but when comared to the Emperor EVERYONE is lowly).

It hits on major events (the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius), discusses a little about the building and public works projects of the ""nicer"" emperors, and gives a period in history that is so distant from us in time a very easily accessible slant.  Let's face it, Romans are just like us, but without the smart phones and computers.

Highly recommended for the casual historian interested in learning a little more about Rome.",1315785600,52,1067,4.648936170212766

1636276,4,B00005NI7G,this is a good series but to bad it start's at the begining of the Roman Empire and not the Roman Republic.....which started in 437 bc. Nor the wars of carthage are mentioned or macadionian wars. It does however show other charcter's of the roman empire.,1301616000,4,254,4.543478260869565
1636277,4,B00005NI7G,"I don't know where the other reviewer got the ""feminist"" or ""revisionist"" slant.  It looked like standard history to me.  I am not an academic or expert of any sort, but I have read some in this area.  You don't get deep history in 90 minutes.  It was a documentary whose primary goal was to impart information rather than entertain.  I enjoyed it because I enjoy history and I always learn something.",1299110400,37,401,4.513888888888889
1636278,2,B00005NI7G,"My opinion?

A modern day American 'feminist influenced' and 'politically correct' version of Roman history.

Not very good.

Those professors interviewed are overpaid and under-qualified, in my opinion.",1298678400,16,203,6.178571428571429
1636279,3,B00005NI7G,"This was a casting error.  Sigourney Weaver is an excellent actress.  However, she does not have the strong voice needed to carry the weight of this empire.  Although Roman women had a great deal of behind-the-scenes power, it was the men who physically built, protected, and maintained its existence.  Somehow this is lost in the feminine voice.  Liam Neeson was a superb choice to narrate ""The Greeks.""  What happened?",1235779200,,420,5.0144927536231885

One glaring error keeps it from being five stars: The census taken at the time of Jesus' birth was from Tiberius, not Augustus, as the show says.

7947506,4,B00005NI7G,"This is pretty good and it gives somethings I was not aware of. The chief reason I am writing this review pertains to a comment about Jesus replying to a young man wanting  to follow Jesus & he replied to Jesus as to following Him, Lord let me first bury my father then I will follow you, whereupon Jesus replied let the dead bury the dead come follow me, The woman in this documentary made this look awful demanding of Jesus but the real issue here is the young man wanted to get his inheritance & wanted to stay till his father passed away so he could get his inheritance which might be years down the road. It is not a situation where his father had died & he needed to bury him now, nor is it some illness and he might die anytime soon. Others whom Jesus called such as Peter left their occupations and immediately followed Jesus. Which is keeping with Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you.",1502755200,2,934,4.217877094972067
7947507,4,B00005NI7G,"I am not a scholar so was depending on this series to be factual & accurate in it's depictions.  From reading other reviews I get the impression that much was left out & I personally was left hanging in several places feeling like more information was needed.  I was, however, very entertained & learned alot.  I hope producers of these kinds of series take seriously their responsibility to present the facts since they are being watched by people like me who are not scholars on the subject & have no idea if the information is accurate.  I do agree with one of your reviewers...""history is repeating itself!""  Mankind is in a self destructive circle, still dealing with insane, cruel, power hungry mad men who do not & have no intention of living life for the good of people.  Makes me feel hopeless about the future.",1501891200,,820,4.620689655172414
