8219302,4,B000VL90S6,"I finally got to see this match after 16 plus years. I watched the semifinals but had to (hope to watch) the finals on tape delay. I set up my VHS for the expected time and they put something else on. Result? No match. Big Disappointment.

PROS:
1. No commercials.
2. Original ESPN2 telecast with Chris Marlowe and Heather Cox as commentators.
3. Finally got to see this.
4. Rookie season of Keri Walsh (3 time Olympic gold medalist - beach volleyball with Misty May).
5. Full match.
6. One of the best finals of all time (went the full 5 sets).

CONS:
1. No extras such as player and coach interviews.
2. Short championship celebration (14 seconds of celebration included).
3. No time outs shown which would lend to player and coach reactions and emotions.
4. No pre-game hype (first second shown is the first serve of the game).
5. For the price - wish they had included the semi-final matches.

Overall, if you are a huge volleyball fan, go ahead and get this, but buy used if you can.",1372464000,,988,4.447513812154696
