4319840,4,B004BN2UT6,"Amazing footage as best as could be reconstructed, I suppose from nearly 70 years ago...
It appears that following the 12/7/1941 after the incident at Pearl Harbor the U.S. could not ignore the World War II anymore and they had to get actively involved, so they erected the 8th Air Force Division if I'm not mistaken and from 7 pilots and zero planes they built a massive B-17 Flying Fortress (also B-24. & B-29) and P51-Mustangs for dogfights (air to air battles) fleet (the word Armada comes to mind). 26,000 lives were lost in both the European arena and the Pacific theater of war from the U.S. fleet... (more than twice the number of mobile infantry in the ground of both Utah beach and Omaha beach - Operation Overlord - The Allied invasion to Normandy).",1307491200,,760,4.637037037037037

I'm glad I waited till now to buy a dvd about the air war in Europe. I like how this documentary is presented, with footage from both sides.

4319844,5,B004BN2UT6,The movie had some raw language with very graphic scenes and I would not view with young children present.  Other than that I think it was spot on.,1300320000,8,147,4.25
4319845,4,B004BN2UT6,"this is a very interesting documentary specially for the rarity of color images of WWII and because the quality of these images is excellent. It is specially recommended for people with an interest in WWII. The documentary is all in all very good but I did not give the five stars due to how this story is narrated or organized...The documentary jumps from one character to another to make the story more interesting, but the way this was done is not very easy to follow, sometimes the parts are too fragmented and a seconds distraction will make you loose the thread of the story. Still a beautiful documentary and I highly recommended it.",1297123200,31,640,4.672566371681416
4319846,4,B004BN2UT6,"Lets first remember that 67 years ago there were no HD movie cameras or camcorders available for photography. This film was filmed with 16mm handheld cameras by members of USAAF flight and ground crews, mostly in and over Europe. Although the use of color does enhance this movie, lets not forget that the original films are two thirds of a century old and do show their age. This movie should not be compared with your typical movies of that era that have been digitally enhanced or professionally filmed on a Hollywood set.

That being said this movie is an informative,  first person account of the Air War in Europe as told by four veterans of the Eight Air Force, including the then war correspondent Andy Rooney.  Other than Andy, there are no stars nor actors in this film. There are just a group of young, brave airmen who are on their dangerous missions in the flak filled skys of Germany and doing their best to return their aircraft, crews and themselves safely to their bases in the UK.

 This film is both sobering and uplifting at the same time. If you have an interest in  military aviation and WW2 you will find this movie able to bring you back to the time of the air war in Europe as seen from a different prospective than the Hollywood produced movies of the era.",1296864000,9,1282,4.504310344827586

4319848,5,B004BN2UT6,"This is one of the best WW2 Documentaries this Century. With the advent of HD, the viewer has clear, and definitive at the aerial combat like it has never been seen. The color is shaper, giving you a sence of being there. Joe Scalise",1295654400,3,233,4.318181818181818
4319849,5,B004BN2UT6,"One of the best accounts on the American air war over Europe, as seen from the perspective of the brave men of the ""Mighty Eigth"" Air Force who helped wage it.  Amazing color footage of the daytime bombing and straffing missions that helped the Allies gain supremacy of the skies, grind the Luftwaffe resistance down to nothing in a war of numbers and attrition and eventually soften up Fortress Europe for the D-Day invasion.  Dignified, almost reverent, interviews and first hand accounts from surviving veterans are woven into the storyline for maximum impact, adding immediacy and poigniancy.  These men still view themselves as nothing more than average guys, swept up by events, who felt an obligation to do their duty and rescue the world from the darkness of tyranny and oppression.  Their courage in that cauldron that claimed so many thousands of their commrades, the way they quietly went home afterwards and with humility, raised families and built a better, stronger, America and the pride they feel at this accomplishment is palpable.

One cannot help but be left with the realization that the exceptional men of this generation are far more than ""ordinary"".  We owe much of our freedom and prosperity to them and their legacy.  Their sacrifices should never be forgotten and this documentary does a first rate job of helping to keep their story alive for generations to come.

If you are captivated by the heroic actions and exploits of the daring bomber and fighter pilots of the US Army Air Force in the skies over Europe, this DVD is not to be missed.",1291766400,74,1569,4.87218045112782

Andy Rooney started out as a reporter on a B-17 aircraft and takes you through a mission that he experienced. It shows you the tragedy of planes not returning and young men coming back from the battle dead or wounded. It also includes interviews of several veterans of the air war. When I watch this film, I try to visualize what it was like to be shot down in a B-17, then captured and put into a NAZI's prison camp as my uncle was!

4319878,5,B004BN2UT6,"Terrific photography but very depressing, as well. Too many American Fly Boys, were left and buried in Europe. It is so horribly sad and to think that in one mission, of about 800 B-17s or B-29s, over 260 of those planes went down. Each plane had about 12 crewmen, so, do the math to see how pervasive it becomes. Andy Rooney is in this film as he was a reporter, writing his views of the war and each of the missions he went on. He remarked of how petrified he was, each and every time he had to get inside the Bomber for the next mission. I cannot imagine, having to wake up, dress with the warmest clothes issued to you, sit and eat breakfast, then go to a briefing, while the brass shows you maps, flight routes, Wx patterns, winds, etc... At the altitude they flew, going into Germany, the air at that level was about minus 40 degrees F. Everything and anything freezes at that level...It is a very important DVD to own, for historians or those who, as a hobby, study WWII.

All who served, all who supported, all who worked to help, all who gave an encouraging word should be remembered.  It is not what you did in the war, it is not how talented you were, nor even that you were lucky enough to serve.  This was the age of diseases such as polio, hunger, poverty, and dispair.

4319891,5,B004BN2UT6,"This account focuses on the 100th and the 306th Bomb Groups of the 8th Air Force in the year leading up to D-Day. My father was a B-17 waist gunner during this time with the 306th. Like most veterans that went thru this horrendous experience, he never spoke of it. If I, as a kid in the 60's, brought it up, he would quickly change the subject. However, he kept a meticulous and highly detailed diary of his terror days with the 306th (which I read in the attic, much to his anger), some of which are brought to life with this excellent account. Also, Joe Armanini, a local boy from Santa Cruz California, does a great job of accounting the horrifying pressure of being lead Bombardier - hundreds of bombers drop when you drop. If you get it wrong, hundreds, possibly thousands of women, children and civilians will die. If you linger in the death zone over the target, your comrades die...and you're being shot at and could die any second....I CANNOT imagine the pressure. Regarding my dad, he accounts in his diary how he is assigned to a B-17 and goes to check out his new position, only to be hit by an overwhelming stench of roadkill. The other waist gunner quickly informed him that what he is smelling are the bits and pieces of the guy he replaced....splattered all over the millions of nooks and crannies of the unfinished (and unpressurized) waist of that B-17, and that ""they don't pull planes off the line because they stink"". My dad noted he got out of the plane and vomited off the hard-stand....this stuff is now lapsing into the end of first-account memory...we, as a Nation, tend to have short memories....let us remember these 50,000 guys that died in that terrible time.... Watch this video with your kids, and don't gloss over it in some kind of ""heroic"" way. My dad signed up for the Air Corps because he thought planes were cool (think being a astronaut now..)....what he didn't know is that he was signing up with was 7 out of 10...suicide.",1368144000,13,1963,4.548022598870056

As an AFS exchange student, I lived in a suburb of Hamburg, the second largest city in Germany, and stayed with a family in the summer of 1958. This was 13 years after the end of WWII. I noted that the  high school students there wore the same clothes every day, probably because they did not have the money to buy new clothes.
To get to Germany all of us students went on a ship because airline flights were too dangerous. When you see the prop planes flying in war you will understand why we didn't take an airplane.",1359244800,,621,4.262711864406779
4319897,4,B004BN2UT6,"A teaching colleague of mine uses this movie as part of her social studies class of 8th graders.  That's because there's only one paragraph of three sentences in her 2009 textbook ""The American Journey"" about the Allied air war over Germany.  This documentary helps round out the American war effort during World War II.

I had a chance to watch this documentary for my own pleasure.  This 108-minute documentary is a combination of raw war footage and oral history of four surviving B-17 crew members and several support personnel of the Army's 8th Air Force, their memories of fallen comrades, bombed-out London and their time off-duty in England.  These men were in their early 20s at the time; today they are in their 90s (with Andy Rooney having passed on in late 2011).  There is social and military history in this production, with minimal graphic imagery early on when color video footage of burn victims is shown, and mild language heard in some of the radio messages.

The documentary also covers the American war propaganda.  Not all of the bombing raids proved successful.  Schweinfurt only had one-third of the bombs hit the military facility; Augsburg's Messerschmidt's factory was quickly rebuilt and the German war drive remained intact.  American casualty rates were higher than reported to keep American troop's morale high, and the support for the war back home remained high despite the propaganda.

And while there is some melodrama in the end (to stress the inhumanity of war), this is a very good video to show young students as the comments about love and loss are eternal.  We are fighting a different war now but the ""war is hell"" adage still rings true.  This documentary helps teachers discuss all aspects of war, from a military/political side and a social/human side.",1358899200,,1797,4.95

4319905,5,B004BN2UT6,"I have been watching WWII documentaries since they began broadcasting them in the 1950s. There isn't much I haven't seen even foreign documentaries and movies are a valuable source of information and understanding.

This was on the Military History Channel and I knew right away I wanted a copy. I am thrilled with this DVD.

Both friend and foe have a story to tell about their armies, air forces, weapons and reasoning or complete lack of reasoning.

I was in 3 RD Grade in 1956 when our Teacher read an interview of a young airman's survial at Hickam Field when the Japanese Attacked on 12/7/1941. It was the 15 TH Anniversary of the Attack. Then she announced that this young airman's son is in our class today. I was surprised to say the very least when she announced it was ME!! She had left the man's name out of the interview.

That night at supper I carefully waited until I thought it was a good time to ask Pop. He was a big man when I was in third grade. He was as surprised as I had been that I asked this question.

He asked me how I learned this and I said YOU WERE OUR HISTORY LESSON FOR TODAY!!

After this the 15 TH Anniversary he slowly opened up more and more. He had enlisted in 1937 and was there the morning of December 7, 1941. Within only a couple of minutes he lost at least two friends he had served with his entire time in the Army Air Corp.

That story and that History Lesson started me off. My father's only REGRET, and now mine own, IS HOW LITTLE WAS COVERED OR MENTIONED EVEN NOW ABOUT THE ARMY AIR CORP IN THE PACIFIC Theater. They fought with the Marines at Midway, Guadalcanal, the Solomons, New Hebres and on and on. His Air Corp Unit the 11 BGH the 42 Squadron was awarded the same DUC as the Marines by Admiral McCain. This was the only time up to this point that one branch recommended and awarded another branch such an honor.

In the Pacific they lived in damp tents, rats ate everything canvas, leather and mosquitoes carried all kinds of diseases, the water was bad, the food was never hot or enough of, ammunition was always in short supply, enough trained crew men were always in short supply, they honestly and actually age powered eggs from WWI.

It wasn't like in Europe when they got back there was no going into London for a beer.

Books, movies and documentaries are in short supply on the Pacific just like during the war. Churchill, Roosevelt and Marshall had agreed early on to win the war in Europe first, then the Pacific. It wasn't under VE Day they began to get what they really needed in the Pacific until then the FOUGHT WITH WHAT THEY HAD, and they did a great job.",1343174400,,2627,4.3319755600814664

4319908,4,B004BN2UT6,"It is a great documentary the color footage really makes you realize how bloody and scary the war was. Don't expect it to be a full hd movie because after all the videos are more that 60 years old. It could be 5 stars but it lacks the Nazi point of view. Also be aware that the documentary only covers the aerial bombing campaign before D-Day, there is no air war account from the Eastern front, the Mediterranean, or the Pacific.",1326326400,10,430,4.320987654320987
4319909,4,B004BN2UT6,Awesome documentary with great commentary on the air war! I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas after we had seen it together on the military channel. I rated it 4 stars only because I wish it had come in bluray.,1324944000,,219,4.365853658536586
4319910,5,B004BN2UT6,"Excellent, excellent representation of the 8th Air Forces trials, struggles and contributions to the defeat of the Axis powers during WWII. It covers all aspects of the air war over Europe from the mundane to the moments of shear horror. Some images are not pleasant and may upset young or naive viewers, but such is war; real and not a video game.
 It tells the story of the air war not only from the historical aspect, but from personal recollections from 4 veterans that survived the war. This aspect ""puts a face"" to the stories and provides unique viewpoints from angles the majority of viewers will hopefully and thankfully never experience and just cannot be learned from a book.
 Many thanks to those who did not return and to these vets for sharing their experiences with us. They are windows to history that will be soon, gone forever.",1324944000,,845,4.702702702702703

4319912,2,B004BN2UT6,"That is how i felt while watching this seemingly Hollywood movie style ""documentary"". The topic and picture of what you are watching switches around so much that you had better drink extra coffee to be able to pay attention to SOME of the nice footage in colour..but the rest of the time you might be watching some guy sitting in his living room talking about HIS personal expierience. although some of the the actual colour footage is interesting..you have Hollywood style enhancement of it..with movie style music in the background. etc.

one might think they are actually watching a Hollywood movie instead of a documentary.  shame.",1323129600,,635,4.981132075471698
4319913,4,B004BN2UT6,"Very informative movie, plenty of action, mixed with good commentary. I can't imagine what fortitude it took to participate in the air wars late in the war.  Also, what an impact the P51's had! If you like WWII history and especially air battles, this is the movie to watch.",1319500800,2,274,4.591836734693878

4319915,5,B004BN2UT6,"Basically, the many flying sequences tell a story of the Eighth Army Air Force and the sacrifices necessary to clear the skies of Nazi air supremacy in preparation for the invasion at Normandy.

New to me was employing the P-51 fighters as aggressors rather than simply as bomber escorts. General Doolittle used the B-17 bombers as bait to draw the Messerschmidt 109s. The results were disastrous for the Germans.

Interesting.

Fills the gaps.

I recommend the film for anyone interested in World War II history of the air war in Europe.",1316044800,4,538,4.8791208791208796

4319917,5,B004BN2UT6,"Let me start off by saying that my cousin was a B-17 waist gunner stationed in England with the 8th Air Force and was fortunate enough to complete his 25 missions. I still have the letter from the Army Air Corps displayed proudly. Being a former aircrew member myself (C-141B Flight Engineer), I've always had a fascination with B-17's thanks to my cousin. I decided to purchase this dvd and glad I did. This documentary chronicled the air war through the eyes of the men who were there. Along with Andy Rooney, these men told their story. This documentary brings home the great sacrifices that were made by these airman. The number of losses was staggering and I can't believe my cousin flew his 25 missions. Thanks to the introduction of the P-51, these airman help destroy the greatest air force at the time. Very informative and highly recommended.",1313798400,3,852,4.724832214765101

4319919,4,B004BN2UT6,"A few recurring shots, but overall a reasonable documentary of a not so well known aspect (to me, at least) of the air war and sacrifices made.  Suggest Bedpan Commando for ground war in Europe/Africa, a nurses diary.",1310256000,,217,4.7105263157894735

8422064,5,B004BN2UT6,Excellent film.  You don't really appreciate the sacrifices our airmen did until you see these pics.  More Airmen were killed in WW II than Marines.  It was stupidity on the part of Washington to believe that the bombers could go on their bombing missions without fighter escort.,1527120000,,279,4.8936170212765955
