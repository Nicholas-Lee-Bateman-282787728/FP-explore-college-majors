2677794,5,B000JMKKXG,"Better Burn...Better Buns is one of the initial four videos offered via Tracie Long's last venture, Tracie Long Training (TLT). Tracie herself leads this workout, which is mainly cardio with a lower body toning emphasis; also, because it is functional fitness in nature, you'll be working your core throughout. Equipment used includes a medicine ball (2-5 lbs.), a dowel or stick, and something to use under your feet for gliding work (e.g., rags for hardwood floors, paper plates on carpet). Tracie is joined by Sherry, who shows easier modifications, and Stephanie, who displays more advanced versions, including some higher impact.

The DVD menu offers only two options, play or preview. Although there are no chapter menus, the workout is broken up into 18 chapters, so you can skip around as needed. The workout begins with a warm-up using the medicine ball with simple moves such as heel life, chest press, ""rocking horse,"" knee lifts, twists, and squats. Setting down the ball, Tracie then moves into a series dynamic stretches; the hips, glutes, and legs receive special attention here, and Tracie notes that the moves are great for runners (the warm-up/stretch segment is about 7.5 minutes total). To continue preparing the body for cardio, plank work comes next (3 minutes). You use the stick here, moving back and forth over it first with your hands, then with your legs. Tracie then moves into cardio with the ball: you'll do lunges with rotations, optional jacks, squats with rotations, optional jumps, and standing supermans to work on balance (3.5 minutes). Then, without the ball (using the stick for balance if needed), you'll work the hips/glutes with standing side leg pushes. After transitioning with additional superman balances, you'll further tone this area with gliding work: with your rag/plate under one foot, you move your leg in and out and then around while remaining in a low squat. After doing one leg only, Tracie offers some quick stretches and then goes back to cardio with standing side crunches. This segment includes front lunges and rear dips while weaving the ball through the legs plus a fast side-to-side squat (think Turbo Jam Cardio Party 1). Next comes a sort of agility drill segment where you'll do fast side-to-side toe taps moving to leg swings and ending with in and out hops and quick runs. This long series (12 minutes) ends by repeating the toning work on the other leg (the non-dominant one: I wish Tracie had started with this leg first, because my legs were pretty exhausted by this point).

Tracie continues with additional medicine ball cardio. There are some more traditional moves here, such as speed skaters, glute lifts, and squats (with optional jumps; the few higher impact moves in this workout are very easily modified). However, Tracie adds functional work with twists plus a ""stir the pot"" move with the arms that you will really feel in your core (4.5 minutes). Additional toning/balance work follows: you'll do standing side leg lifts and more gliding work, this time sliding the rag/plate in and out of a back lunge and then in a diagonal fashion--my glutes were really fried by the end of this work! Again, Tracie goes into a cardio segment before moving on to the other leg. Here you'll do ""hurdles,"" first taking a wide leg step over an imaginary hurdle and then squatting to duck under one; Tracie adds push-ups onto this sequence and then ends this segment ends with a shuffle move. The medicine ball is used for the final cardio segment, which includes v-steps forward and back plus side lunges and knee repeaters (adding a weave with the ball through the legs); I recognized the music here from the old FitPrime Crunch Time video with Susan Harris. Following this, you complete the ""standing mop"" toning work on the other leg (the entire series is 12 minutes long).

Next it's down to the floor for abs work. Lying supine with your arms overhead, you'll crunch up, moving your hands to touch your feet (first same side, then twisting). Then you'll keep your feet in the air and touch the ball to your toes; finally, you'll weave the ball through your ankles in a figure 8. Following this, you'll need two rags/plates for bridge work: keeping your hips elevated, you'll slide one foot in and out. More crunch work follows, this time using the stick. Tracie starts with her knees bent, stick under her feet, then she brings the stick up, around her feet, and overhead. I simply could NOT reach far enough to do this (I want to believe that my arms are too short, but it seems more likely that my flexibility is limited), so I had to follow the modifier. The 8.5 minute core work segment ends with v-sit twists and side plank work, both of which were quite tough! The workout concludes with an excellent 6.5 minute stretch segment which particularly focus on the hips. She incorporates many moves from yoga, including cat/cow, down dog, crazy dog, lunge, double pigeon (with nice posture work), Sage twist, and forward bends--this was a perfect end to such a lower-body intensive workout. The entire workout clocked in at just under 56 minutes (all individual segment times are approximate).

The day after doing this workout for the first time, I felt a pleasant soreness in my entire leg but particularly my hamstrings. I really liked that this video provided an excellent cardio workout (according to my heart rate monitor, I was in my target zone for 30 minutes, and I expect that to go even higher as I become more familiar with the moves), while also providing a great toning workout for the lower body (just where I need it!). Plus, the moves were different and fun, and the entire workout thoroughly targeted the core as well. This is another first-rate video from Tracie's TLT series, and I highly recommend it.",1170115200,17,5794,4.861336032388664

8152274,5,B000JMKKXG,"I have many Firm workout videos led by Tracie Long.  She is definitely a favorite of mine.  I recently came across this series, even though it's been out for a while.  It sounded different, so I decided to give it a try.  I purchased all 4 in this series.  So far, I have only done this video one time, but I definitely felt the burn.  I have been working out steadily - 5 days a week - for just under a year now.  This workout has different moves and it's challenging.  I plan to add this video (and the others in the series) to my regular rotation. I like that there is a lot of focus on the core in these workouts.  Tracie is an excellent instructor and is the best at giving cues, in my opinion.",1362528000,,699,4.043795620437956
8152275,5,B000JMKKXG,"You will definetely feel the burn after this workout!  I own this DVD for a while now, I have to say I feel the burn each and every time I do it.  I am glad I bought it.  I recomended at 100%,",1315958400,,192,3.5238095238095237
8152276,4,B000JMKKXG,"This is one of four workouts from Tracie Long's Functional Training series.  I love Tracie Long; she's one of the original instructors for the Firm.  Those early workouts got me started with weight training.  Functional training is important for everyone; it's especially important as we age.

Why I love this workout:

**Tracie Long is a truly a master instructor.  She gives form pointers at just the right time.  She also tells you exactly what muscle and exactly what you should be feeling when doing a particular movement.

**Minimal equipment is needed for this workout.  All you need are glider discs, or paper plates and a medicine ball.  I contrast this with the Cathe Friedrich workouts, where you can be using dumbbells, barbells, bands and a ball all in the same workout.

**Workout location.  This was filmed in Tracie's studio in Charleston, South Caroline.  In the background, you have a nice view of Charleston Harbor.  I've spent many a wonderful family vacation in Charleston and have many fond memories of that beautiful city.  It's fun to see the view and reminisce.

**Three levels are shown - low impact beginner, medium and advanced.

What I didn't care for in this workout:

**It's really not that intense, even when following the advanced exerciser.  I much prefer Tracie's earlier functional training workouts from the Revolutions (Core Foundations, Functional Strength and Dynamic Strength & Power) and Yorktowns (Core Cardio, Core Strength).  These were tough and I always felt very worked out when I finished. I barely break a sweat with this series.

**The odd and unhelpful camera angles.  Since many of these exercises are multi-joint, eg lunges with overhead presses, it was hard to picture what you should be doing.  There was too much focus on the ""easy"" modifier.  There was also too many shots of just arms or legs.  It would have been much more helpful to have full body shots  of all the exercisers so you can see exactly what you should be doing.

**All four workouts in this series are very similar, even though the titles imply that each workout has a different focus.  Jen Carmen and Susan Harris lead two of the workouts, for some added variety.

Since I love Tracie as an instructor, I kept this workout.  I use it when I want to do an easier workout, or doing my recovery week.
If you're looking for a fun workout, that will help your balance and your core, and one that's not too hard, this workout may be for you.",1303257600,3,2461,4.79047619047619
8152277,5,B000JMKKXG,"This is a great cross training DVD with moves they don't do in typical gym clasess such as BodyPump/Les Mills series.  Tracy is a great instructor and knows how to cue.  The DVD alternates between cardio and leg exercises.  There is also core and balance work.  There is enough variety to keep it interesting.  You can vary the intensity, but it is always a challenging workout for me.  I especially enjoy the variety of exercises on this DVD; some of which I've never seen anywhere else.  Highly recommended for intermediate and advanced exercisers.",1267660800,,550,4.849462365591398
8152278,4,B000JMKKXG,"While I have only had the opportunity to do this DVD once since I purchased it a few weeks ago, I feel it will be a good one.
The exercises seem to move along a little fast and Tracie gives cues like you should know what they are, however after a few time of using this DVD I think it will come easier.
It's definitely a calorie burner.",1252886400,2,336,3.9558823529411766
8152279,5,B000JMKKXG,"I love tracie long training dvds.  I usually use this DVD once per week to supplement jogging and yoga. It really tones your lower body like running can't do and shapes your butt! You can really feel the difference in your lower body after working muscles that normally don't get overexerted. Even when i'm feeling non-motivational its easy to work out because you don't have to drive anywhere.  Its really fun and challenging, and i also love the music. You will feel stronger and more confident after doing this workout.",1235952000,2,522,4.788888888888889
8152280,5,B000JMKKXG,I'm a fitness instructor who works out almost everyday. I found this work out to be well taught and challenging. Tracie does a great job of cueing and her exercises often have a different twist to them from what you normally see. I am very pleased and am planning on buying more of her DVD's. This is not a beginner's workout by the way.,1209254400,,337,4.28125
8152281,5,B000JMKKXG,"I do not want to be redundant to the already thorough reviews of this workout but do want to add my opinion.  I consistently used the Firm (old and new) and Jari Love for my workouts.  Both are tried and true.  However, I tend to tire of the predictability of the workouts (especially Jari Love).  The Tracie Long workouts (I have all four) constantly challenge your mind and body.  The moves are different from the old standards; thus, I find myself paying attention to what is being said and done.  I noticed that in these workouts (most notably Better Burn Better Buns and Strength in Movement), I was sweating early on, and that my core was being actively worked.  I did not find the moves to be risk-filled, i.e., I do not think that injury is likely.  These workouts are fun.  They are challenging, and they produce results.",1204761600,8,830,4.554054054054054
8152282,5,B000JMKKXG,"I won't go into details since this workout has been so beautifully detailed by previous reviewers and I must say I don't write alot of reviews,I just had too on this workout! This workout came in a 4 pack DVD set by Tracie and this was the very first Tracie Long workout I have ever done. I only wish I would have found her sooner!! In 20 plus years of in- home exercise with countless instructors,Tracie is definitely one of the best. She is a TRUE professional,her cuing is flawless!! I absolutely LOVE this workout!  The addition of the medicine ball is brillant,the production is excellent,the music very upbeat and motivating.
  Not your usual routine,this one is very different from anything I have ever done,I LOVE the ""gliding"" segments and instead of the recommended paper plate or rag I used Gliding discs and they worked perfect. I like that not alot of equipment is used in Tracie's productions. I am sad to see,however,that these being 2005 productions, she hasn't come out with anything new yet. I truly hope she does,she is one of the best! I HIGHLY recommend this workout!!",1186790400,12,1089,4.721052631578948
