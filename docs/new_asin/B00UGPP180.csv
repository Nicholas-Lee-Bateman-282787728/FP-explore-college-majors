8705711,1,B00UGPP180,"A bastardized Alien sequel of sorts sans the classic ""lovable"" monster* and the classic horror/sci-fi movie makings. This is chaotic chaos in a sci-fi setting with nifty graphics, ominous soundtrack and the standard Godless humanism dogmas, The drawn-out fiction might have been dreamed up by a talented creative-writing student with lots of time on their hands and a bunch of sci-fi shows to watch with extra time given to the Alien collection. Someone will love this, but if you share my demographic** then pass on it, UNLESS you might want some MST3000-style laughter. I did start laughing at one point, after the gal gave herself a Ceasarean in the operating booth. At least the ""partial-birth"" abortion was committed on an evil monster resembling Hillary Clinton. A ""choice"" well-made. So if you: are in your fifties, love America, can't believe THEY are still talking about Russia taking over the election, and thank God for our Great American President, then you are somewhat in my demographic. BTW: a man, one of the two possibilities. *I don't want to ruin the movie for you IF you watch it to the end.  At one point, the robot says ""What would Charles do?"" Truly, as pointed out in Ann Coulter's GODLESS, Liberalism IS a religion, and they are fighting to extinguish Christians and the Church. They worship science and scientists, in part. Charles is a scientist.
I would watch the original Alien, if you haven't seen it in a while. It was a doozy, along with Jaws, for thrillers.
I enjoyed Charlize in Monster, a nitty-gritty movie about a tragic real life. Some other movies I enjoyed:
Hancock, (the new) Mad Max, The Devil's Advocate, The Drop(nothing to do w Charlize but great)",1520985600,,1692,4.875
8705712,4,B00UGPP180,"Watching the 3D version provoked this review.

I bought this set a few years ago (for a lot less than $243!) on the anticipation I'd eventually have a 3D player and display. That occurred about two months ago (an Oppo 205 and Sony 930, if it's of any interest).

""Prometheus"" has many problems, the principal one being the explorers' general stupidity and lack of intellectual discipline. (There's a brilliant review by another Amazon reviewer that riffs on this.) These become a major distraction from the other problems, most-notably confused character motivations and not-very-coherent plotting. The second time, it all starts to fall into place, more or less (though rather less than more -- what did the squid embryo eat to let it grow so big, so quickly?). Though Ridley Scott says ""Prometheus"" isn't supposed to be a prelude to ""Alien"", almost everything in it anticipates ""Alien"".

The 3D is almost all native, shot with custom 3D rigs, and it's spectacular. The 3D ""opens up"" a number of otherwise-cluttered scenes, especially the orrery and its related controls. The only problem is that, even with my set's backlighting turned all the way up, the 3D glasses absorb enough light that, in some scenes, the darker areas lose most or all detail.

PS: I ain't sellin' it.",1509321600,,1277,4.953271028037383
