It's very hard to show the expanse of Khan's empire but I liked the subtle way they did it by showing glimpses of the entertainers and shamans (or medicine men) from the various parts of the empire.

I remember reading about the early years of the Moscow people with their wooden houses, connection to the Orthodox church, and their pay-offs to the Tartars.  This movie showed that.

I also thought this movie had character and was artistic, if you are into artistic movies.  I recommend to any history buff.",1375401600,6,783,4.791044776119403

I guess this movie is like a litmus test on where you stand with regard to what the horde did to Asia and Europe and frankly, as  political motivation, Russia doesn't want the tendency of the Mongols to go Muslim to invite a synergistic breed to claim rightful title to Russia by the one true god's followers, right?

This movie is THRILLING in its bold - RUSSIANY step back Japan - trash talking way - calling out the Mongols like the Stans don't need to be flattered.

""the main detractors are expected to be Russia's nearly 6 million Tatars, who are considered the country's modern-day descendants of nomads who joined Genghis Khan's army and eventually helped to create the Golden Horde.

They say the film -- which received financial backing from Orthodox Encyclopedia, a company that has backed numerous movies glorifying the Russian Orthodox Church and the lives of its saints -- falsely depicts the Golden Horde as an empire dominated by random violence, greed, and ignorance.

The film's director, Andrei Proshkin, has defended the film as a work of ""historic fiction,"" saying it was never intended as a true-to-life depiction of the Golden Horde.

Still, he has acknowledged that the movie is likely to displease many viewers in Tatarstan, Russia's prosperous and predominantly Muslim republic that is home to the majority of the country's Tatars.

""It's difficult to predict what kind of reaction there's going to be [in Tatarstan],"" Proshkin says. ""Probably, people are going to be offended. But what can you do?""

___

In order to respond to this film, Tartars have to claim ancestral superiority if not equality and to do so, they have to completely ignore the existence of China (Not  a good sign and very Japanese):

What was the basis of the Horde's force? How could they have conquered half of the world if they were so stupid? Now it's time to dispel myths about nomad nations as ignorant barbarians which conquered everything like locusts due to their multiplicity and cruelty.

Let's begin with the fact that the beginning of all the civilizations is located in Sumer. But the Sumerian language is half Turkic and it's well-known that the Sumers consisted of two nationalities and one of them came to Mesopotamia from the north-east, i.e. from the Kazakh steppes. Let's have a look at the Egyptian pharaohs: all of them had mongoloid traits. Let's have a look at the Phoenicians (supposedly the Semites) who were the first to invent a phonetic orthography. The Egyptians called them Asians and the Phoenicians on the Egyptians bar-relieves looked more mongoloid than the Mongols themselves. So, the beginning of everything was somewhere in Asia. The Asians have only transferred their skills to the Semites, the Africans and the Aryans.

The recent research showed that the proto-turkics were not just only a nomadic nation. Forest steppes of the Southern Urals, northern and central Kazakhstan were their original area. The climate in the 5th millennium BC was not so arid as it's now in these regions. At that time the Turks were practicing agriculture, animal husbandry and also metallurgy and smithcraft at the fortress towns made of wood and loam.

Considering the fact that modern Turks can be anthropologically classified both as Caucasians and Mongoloids it's possible that they're not genetically related to one ancestor and that their community emerged due to common sophisticated Turkic language, culture and unified state.

The proof that one time the Turks were a sedentary nation can be derived from the fact that all the main terms from agriculture, the names of crops, tools and metals, the word ""fortress town"" (kala), the names of many trees are purely of the turkic origin. The Turks were the first to domesticate the horse, the first to smelt copper, cast iron, bronze, iron and the first to produce Bulat steel. In this regard it seems to me that self-designation of the Kazakhs ""cossack"" means ""mine digger"" in Turkic, because there is a verb ""cosmack"" (to dig) in Turkic, from here derives the word ""cossack"" or ""digging something"". For example, the word ""nail"" in Turkic is also ""cossack"" in some dialects. From here comes and the name of the kazakh city ""Jezkazgan"" which means ""the mine where copper ore is digged"". The Turks created runic phonetic orthography before the Phoenicians, then they created the Uyghur alphabet which they gifted to the Mongols during the Age of Genghis Khan.

They have accomplished all these deeds due to horse domestication. With the horse they started to communicate and exchange knowledge on vast land area with both their tribesmen and foreign tribes. It gave them an enormous head start in development.

Why have Homo Sapiens won after arriving to Europe and living side by side with Neanderthals and why have Neanderthals become extinct? Because all the Homo Sapiens had communication with each other and exchanged information and Neanderthals lived in closed communities and didn't communicate with each other in European region. So, if we want to survive, we need to communicate more and to exchange the best practices with each other.

Then the climate in their area became arid, battle grass in the region populated by the Turks was in short supply and they started to wander at higher scale in pursuit of better grass. Later some nations entirely shifted to a purely nomadic life, especially in summer. Yet they have and permanent winter stations.

So, the beginning of the whole civilization can be found in northern Asia.",1407542400,,5764,5.17741935483871
5682988,5,B00BYS0SV8,"I agree with several of the other commentators that the description for the movie is way off. This is not a movie about ""The Horde"". It is actually a movie about the spiritual development of a Saint in the Russian Orthodox Church. The Horde is just the backdrop and anvil upon which the Saint is forged. This is a great movie to watch. It has many lessons you can learn.",1403395200,6,370,4.3
5682989,4,B00BYS0SV8,"A very good movie in terms of the elements that Hollywood typically neglects, the costums all looked handmade and were filthy looking as you would expect; the characters were emaciated and beaten looking as you would expect.  Again the photography and special effects also give great credit to the Russian cinema - film profession. I am not Russian. A very good and credible plot, a man attempts to do some good and save his people and suffers greatly for it, his core beliefs and faith are tested, as we are all sometimes. Of course not to his extreme. The acting is solid to very good, the main character is excellent. In summary, a great film in a historical setting, man is on a mission to save his people from death and slavery, it is the story of his journey, his unselfish attempts to accomplish an impossible task, his failure, his punishment, and then his salvation.",1401321600,6,875,4.645161290322581

A waste of my money....",1394668800,,322,4.440677966101695
5682992,4,B00BYS0SV8,"I am shock at the low reviews in Amazon but I can't blame them. I saw this movie on a religious Russian web site more than a year ago & it was advertised as the life of St. Alexius, the Metropolitan of Moscow, who prayed over & healed Taidula's blindness who was the mother of the Khan Janibeg in 1357. This movie is neither a historical documentary nor a historical fictional account on the last days of the Mongol Golden Horde instead this movie is a religious epic about a Holy Saint in Russia. The movie does over play the harshness & spiritual depravity of the Horde & over lengthens the punishment given to St. Alexius when his first attempts to heal Taidula's blindness fails. Nowhere in the history books is it written that the Saint had to wait, but that Taidula's cure of blindness was a fast & clear miracle. I guess the punishments given to St. Alexius made great movie making. There are some humorous elements as in St. Alexius's side kick novice monk who turns to other religions to save his physical dilemma but he comes around before the Metropolitan says to him ""Just wait until I get you back to Moscow"". I am guessing at this translation because I saw the movie via a web site with spoken Russian & Mongolian languages with no English sub-titles. The Good news: this DVD comes with both English sub-titles & duped English.

How did, or who wrote the main preview on this DVD? As another Amazon reviewer wrote ""Did they watch the movie?"" I believe the overall ratings would be higher if given to better marketers who would of wrote the truth on what this movie was about. If you read anything on this review, read this: This is not a war movie about the last days of the Horde.",1388534400,11,1695,4.45016077170418

5683004,2,B00BYS0SV8,"First of all, I've seen Mongol (and many other Asian films from Japan, Korea, & China).  I have no reservations whatsoever with watching subtitled movies.  Mongol was excellent, and it sparked my interest in the history of the Mongols.

Secondly, I consider myself an ongoing student of history.  I love it, but the history of man is vast and cannot be learned (in detail) in a lifetime.

That said, this movie gave no explanations as to who any of the characters were (their purpose, role in society, etc.) except for the Holy Master, the Khan, and the French missionaries.  The story is confusing as all hell already, but not knowing who anyone is just adds to the missing puzzle pieces.  Maybe these stories are common in Russia & Manchuria.  If I'd grown up there, would it have made any more sense?  The movie doesn't translate at all to the international audience.  I had to pause it at multiple points to consult Internet sources to try to figure out what was taking place.

Basically, the movie doesn't even try to explain what's going on.

SPOILERS BELOW!@!@!@!

I just finished watching this, and here's what I remember....Fat Mongolian kills his brother (the khan) and becomes Khan.  His mother--some lady who paints her face white and whose horse apparently s***s special poop (I kid you not, the peasants scramble for her horse's poop) refuses to bless his reign as Khan.  He tries to get all Oedipus with her, but she's not having it.

One day, she loses her eyesight.  The Khan (her son) brings in all manner of witch doctors & apothecaries to try to cure her.  None are successful.  Then, he sends emissaries to Moscow requesting a holy man (Saint Alexis of Moscow)..else he'll burn the city down.  The holy man agrees to go, and takes Fyodor (blibbering idiot) back with the emissaries.  They toil all day, but are unable to correct her eyesight.  This is where it really hits the fan.  Alexis is banished, so he wanders about the countryside and then goes back to the city where he is enslaved to scoop poop.  He almost dies, but is saved by the Khan when it is revealed that he DID correct the Khan's mother's eyesight.

Oh wait, so..what?  He failed, was banished, enslaved, almost died, but he actually performed the miracle of restoring her eyesight?  You don't see this happen.  You see him go into her yurt, fail to correct her eyesight, then get kicked out and basically become a beggar.  Apparently, her eyesight comes back and he is credited with restoring it even though he's nowhere to be found when it happens.  Ok, cool.  So then he's rewarded by the Khan and allowed to go back home.  The Khan dies soon after, and his crazy mother rides off into the sunset.  End of story.  Pointless, dull, and, well, a huge waste of time.

Don't bother renting it.  Don't watch it for free.  You'll wait for it to get better, hoping for that part where it all comes together and makes sense.  That never happens, and you're left frustrated and bored.",1377302400,,2968,4.6365384615384615
