8033513,5,B0002VS89M,"I grew up with Getter Robo and Armageddon really brought me to tears the first time I watched it. Even now when I re-watch it, I still tear up at some scenes. Okay, that's definitely because of my emotional relationship with Getter, but Armageddon itself offers a lot of fun to a super robot fan.

It's over the top, but it's what makes super robot shows fun! They do not have as much scientific leanings as anime from real robot or hard-science (sub)genre, so creators are more free to create their world. Prepare yourself for all-out epic battles between robots and monsters!

As for the drama side, I really love that basically 'family' sits at the center of this. I love to see how Musashi and Benkei take responsibility as Genki's adaptive fathers. I love the brother/sister relationship in it.

A nice 2-DVD package in Japanese with subtitles and English dub. Bonuses available: clean opening and ending clips.",1478044800,,916,4.784810126582278

8033515,5,B0002VS89M,"Violent, dark, and action packed. If you've never heard of Getter Robo before, you might be a bit lost at first, but not for long. Good guys vs bad guys with epic robot fights. Incredibly stylish, and great animation.",1477785600,5,217,4.589743589743589
8033516,4,B0002VS89M,"Getter Robo Armageddon, also known as Change! Getter Robo: The Last Day of the World is a fantastic spectacle of hard-hitting mecha action. For the uninitiated, Getter Robo is the original combining super robot, dating back to 1974. Many people credit this bot to Go Nagai (creator of the Super Robot genre with Mazinger Z), but it is actually the brainchild of Ken Ishikawa. Mr. Ishikawa and Go Nagai worked together though, and Nagai certainly had a lot of influence over Getter Robo's creation, but it is still Mr. Ishikawa's work.

With that out of the way, Getter Robo Armageddon is an OVA originally released in 1998, so while attractive and well animated, the show does show its age in its presentation. This is not a retelling of the original shows (of which there had been three produced before this OVA), but it uses the characters from the shows and throws them into a unique storyline in which things take a very dark turn for the Getter Team and, later, the entire world. As the story begins, the brilliant professor that had created the original Getter Robo has been murdered, and the leader of the Getter Team was framed for his death. With Ryoma incarcerated, professor Saotome comes back from the dead to enact a crazy, convoluted scheme that soon has the entire world suffering from the Invaders, a race of amorphous beings able to constantly morph and take over people to control them.

Enter the Shin Getter Robo and Shin Dragon, the pinnacle of Getter ray technology. These mecha were created by Professor Saotome as a countermeasure to stop the Invaders. But wait, wasn't Saotome one of the bad guys? Getter Robo Armageddon weaves a spider web of conspiracies that will have you enthralled from the beginning until the very end. Unfortunately, the original director (Yasuhiro Imagawa, one of the most badass super robot anime directors ever with credits such as Giant Robo and Shin Mazinger Z The Impact to his name) was ousted from the project after the third episode and he took all of his notes with him, leaving the production team with a very convoluted plot to unravel and it takes them a few episodes to get going again, but not without twisting around some of the wonderful conspiracies that the original director had set up in those first three episodes.

The end result is an extremely enjoyable, if somewhat uneven series that is full of adrenaline pumping action and the most badass super robot of all. One of the things that I really like about the Getter Robo series is that the Getter Robos are insanely powerful but not impervious to damage as some other super robots. If the pilots aren't careful, the Getters can get seriously beaten up and that happens quite a few times in this anime. It is also a bit of a guilty pleasure to me that Getter Robo G is never piloted by the good guys since I never liked that Getter, but that's just me.

About the translation: this hasn't changed from the ADV release a few years ago. It's the same dub and while the actors do a good job, there are several mistakes in it that I don't like, but since these mistakes happen consistently, I guess that was the script that the actors were provided with and not the actors themselves making the mistake. For instance, Getter Robo 2 and Getter Robo 3 get swapped in the dubbed version, so Getter Robo 2 is called Getter Robo 3 and vice versa. There are also some conversations in the dub that are completely different than in the original language. One such example is when Ryoma is being released to pilot Getter Robo 1, the soldiers at the base are commenting how they are letting Genki, who is an 8-year old child, pilot the Getter Robo in their desperation but in the original Japanese version they are commenting on how they are releasing a murderer into the wild, and piloting a super robot to boot! Why the difference? Of course, there are other moments when these differences work in favor of the dub as I feel that the Hayato in the dub is snarkier than the original Japanese script had him so that's cool. Overall, if not for the weird robot name swaps and the unusual context in some sections, the dub is fairly good. Even the actor who plays Gou manages to convey the intensity of the original Japanese voice actor's performance. The problem is with the narrator; I just don't enjoy his performance in English. It lacked the energy and was a bit difficult to understand at times.

Anyway, Getter Robo Armageddon is a wonderful series and it looks great in this DVD release. I'd seen it before, but I just had to buy it with this re-release. I highly recommend this series and don't worry; it is a completely standalone product. You don't need to be familiar with the source material to enjoy it (in fact, that may even be beneficial as many characters are composites that can confuse a fan treating them as their original incarnations). Some people mention it as a sequel to the Moon Wars Getter Robo radio drama, and that seems to be the case. However, the reality is that the Moon Wars radio drama was produced after Getter Robo Armageddon as a prequel to it, so while they are both parts of the same story, the anime stands very well on its own and also has the conclusion, which is appropriately awesome for this series and the Getter universe on the whole.

Now I just hope for a Bluray release. I would happily buy it again then, if only to finally enjoy a high definition (even if pillarboxed) version of Ryoma going nuts on the Invaders!",1462492800,,5476,4.605532786885246
8033517,1,B0002VS89M,A whole bunch of hooey....constantly contradicted itself. I reall liked the fat English woman who looked so scared telling her part that she looked like she was going to cry. Good only for a laugh at bad documentaries,1107129600,,217,4.7368421052631575
