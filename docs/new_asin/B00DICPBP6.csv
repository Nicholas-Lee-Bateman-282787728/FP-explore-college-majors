5818403,5,B00DICPBP6,"If you already seen the first half of Future Diary, you know how crazy it is. If you haven't watched it yet, I'm not sure why you're looking at the second collection already. The fate of the entire world is thrust upon the winner of the game presented in this anime, but will the winner be proclaimed before the fabric of time and space is destroyed?

As the first half of the series has established, twelve future diary users must kill one another in a contest in which the winner will become the new god of space and time. The last episode on the first collection ended on a cliffhanger where Yuki, the main character, was captured by his stalker girlfriend, Yuno. Yuki's friends tried to rescue him, but were overcome by Yuno's deadly traps, and are awaiting their demise in the gas chamber.

This time you can expect the last three diary holders to reveal themselves, as well as many surprises. You can never truly know what to expect with this series. Kidnapping, murder, betrayal, dismemberment, and insanity are words to describe this series of unusual events, and Yuno keeps losing her sanity, as well as becoming more violent as the series continues.

Certainly the most interesting character in the whole series is Yuno, with her unusual personality quirks and the secrets that she covets, such as the three dead bodies in her home. The main character, Yuki, does get to do a lot more in this half, and also shows a new personality in the last fourth of the story. Even the comic relief character, Murmur, who almost exclusively appears in the ending of each episode has a larger role in the story as well.

This collection is released by Funimation, like the first half, and they do a pretty good job with this series. Note that this collection is for DVD only; it does not come with a Blu Ray release like a lot of other Funimation releases. The English dub does take some liberties with the script, so if you have seen the Japanese track first, it may be awkward to hear some of the English. If you have seen other Funimation dubs like Shana or Spice and Wolf, then you know what to expect.

On another note, this is probably the craziest anime made in many years, and you can never know what to expect from it. Its more insane than Code Geass or Death Note, both of which are famous for crazy revelations and plot twists, but Future Diary has even more twists for its length of 26 episodes. Overall, this is an insane and violent, but very enjoyable anime series.",1381968000,2,2477,4.532438478747204
5818404,5,B00DICPBP6,"I already expressed how much I liked the first half of this show in my review for the limited edition of part one, but part two definitely surpasses part one by far. Everything is improved here: fight scenes, story, characters, etc... One thing that I have to warn people about though: this is NOT a kid's show! Although it has a few silly moments that I could do without, (just like part one) but overall, this is a dark, graphic, and twisted anime. ""Future Diary"" is definitely the most graphic show I've seen since ""Elfen Lied,"" which is also a great show, but it takes a lot to get to that point. If ""Elfen Lied"" had not shown the insides come out when somebody is ripped apart, ""Future Diary"" would have been gorier by far. The ending is better than a lot of animes out there, but is rather abrupt. If you want a bit more light shed on the ending, watch the ""Redial"" OVA on Youtube. If you do, just skip to the second third, that's where the story really picks up.",1381968000,,969,4.300546448087432

It is well worth your money and time, and even though i am not sure how the dubs are, the Japanese voice actors are great! Get this anime, you will not regret it!",1379203200,6,262,4.0576923076923075
5818408,5,B00DICPBP6,"This review is for now about the anime itself. Those wanting to see a review of the box set itself should come back once it's released and I have a chance to get a hold of it ;)

Those who are coming into this expecting a series about a cute little girl with pink hair that does silly things, are going to find themselves disappointed. A true successor to Death Note, minus the disappointing second act, Future Diary, aka Mirai Nikki, is a darker, more emotional, and more thought provoking story than one would think at first glance.

The anime centers around two characters, Amano Yukiteru and Gasai Yuno, who are caught up in a high stakes game of life or death. Deus ex Machina, the God of the Future Diary universe, is dying, and he's set up a game to determine who will take his place. Each of the 12 contestants is given a 'future diary' that, as the name implies, predicts future events and records them as diary entries, each in a slightly different way. The goal of the game is for each contestant to kill the other 11, and the last man (or woman) standing is the winner.

The great thing about Future Diary is that it gives you a little bit of everything, and holds it together well. The show has a great mix of romance, suspense, comedy, drama, and even horror. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it even has a straight up shonen, super saiyan beat down towards the end.

The characters as well, are one of the places that the series excels at. Even the villains or characters that you hate, will absolutely make you fall in love with them by the end. One in particular comes to mind, one of the first villains you see shows up doing some of the most terrible things in the series, and by the end still manages to come off as not only sympathetic, but one of my personal favorite characters in the series. One of the main characters as well, Yuno, is absolutely exquisitely written. She's adorable, and terrifying, and hilarious, and psychotic all at the same time.

Don't make the mistake of thinking you know what's going to happen either. With a Hunger Games-ish story like this, you can fall into the trap of identifying the main character, and assuming that he's going to win the game and that everybody else is dead. This story has an ending that you will never see coming, although all the clues are there (hint, watch the opening credits closely).

The Japanese voice acting is great, and the animation and soundtrack are both superb. Each perfectly compliments the tone of whatever you're watching, being silly and bubbly one moment, and creepy or suspenseful the next.

If you enjoy series like Gantz and Death Note, then Future Diary is for you, and even if you don't I can't imagine anybody really not liking it. I'll be editing this review once the DVD itself actually comes out to give my thoughts on the box set and the dub.",1373414400,14,2862,4.471264367816092

5818417,5,B00DICPBP6,"Dark, yet beautiful. This goes for both part one and two, and you simply have to watch it to understand. It is almost indescribable. It take the characters to extremes that test their morals, practically ripping their humanity to shreds. The characters have to make the darkest decisions a human mind and soul can take, and twist it so you feel empty. Those dark moments portray much, much more in this anime then I've seen in an anime before. Of course, like many of my favorite animes, it all pulls together in an alternate universe type of ending (don't worry, as this is a minor, minor spoiler) where you don't feel that it truly is a happy ending. You can still see the despair and hardship, especially in the last few episodes; however, the ending makes sense in a dark, yet beautiful way. I'm sure people will think I'm just rambling nonsense, yet I enjoyed this anime enough to make it one of my favorites. From the perspective of those of you who think this is nonsense, I simply pose that this is very, very hard for me to make words for the anime as a whole because I just finished it and found it, as I've stated twice before: Dark, yet beautiful.",1414281600,,1159,4.446009389671362

5818422,4,B00DICPBP6,"This was a really good series in where it had everything one could ask for without falling into the trap of the comic-relief/farce which sometimes occurs when a specific subject is pushed too far: action, romance (albeit in a reather unique manner), slice-of-life... everything I had hoped to find in this series.

The one thing I disliked about it is that it's rather back-and-forth in its storytelling without really telling the viewer. For exmple, for the first half of the series, Yuki is pretty much doing nothing as Yuno is the one taking care of the dirty work. Then suddenly, about 3/4 of the way through, Yuki somehow find his courage and becomes this kind of James Bond-esque hero who actually plans killing people, something which he never considered before (or almost.), conversion which was rather destabilising (though with reference to the events of the previous episode, some may find the connection, I feel it was a bit much of a drastic shift). There's also this story with the two skulls which never seems to end, leading the viewer to wonder what it's all about until the final moment when all is revealed (which makes up for the suspense I guess).

All in all however, the story is very well played out with many twists and turn the viewer don't see coming and very well developped characters. For those who enjoyed Death Note but don't mind delving a bit more into a story slightly less grounded in reality, I recommend this series.

Also, because at the time I could not take all the DVDs with me, I ripped them onto my hard drive with only the audio, which turned out to be a MAJOR annoyance because most of this story revolves around text messages sent by the user' phones, which are all still written in their original japanese. I have checked however and when english subtitles are enabled, the japanese text on the phones is overwritten in english. So to anyone doing the same, take the subs with you!",1406505600,,1929,4.684365781710914

5818428,4,B00DICPBP6,"I wanted to go 5 stars but because of all the crazies, plot holes and ending IMHO, I have to go 4. Firstly, as good as the show may be, the crazy, psychotic girlfriend was a bit much. Second, Part 2 was just as graphic. Almost to the point of excess or being desensitized. Thirdly, by the time I got to the end, Yuki, one of the main characters, becomes one of the most pathetic in anime. This can be verified on Google search for ""future diary pathetic character"".

5818432,5,B00DICPBP6,"Mirai Nikki (Future Diary) will give you one of the best anime experiences of your life, but that's only if you know which episodes to watch. I honestly found that the best way to watch it is to skip episodes 3 through 21. Even if you are a die-hard anime fan, before you cast my review aside because of that statement, hear me out.
I discovered Mirai Nikki while watching anime parodies (abridges) on YouTube. After watching an abridged about it, I was only a little interested in the series itself; however, the intro song was pretty awesome. It's called Kuusou Mesorogiwi (Fantasy Mythology) by  Yousei Teikoku. There are a few different english dubs out on YouTube, but my favorite is done by DaelynD  [...]. You'll also find a link to a free download of her rendition in the video's description. Anyway, I figured that with a song that awesome, it couldn't be that bad. I am not really a fan of anime though, so I watched the last several episodes just to see if it had enough action and plot to keep me interested, and I was blown away by what I saw. Mirai Nikki most definitely captured my interest, so I watched through the whole thing on Hulu. However, I found that a majority of the series actually manages to take away from the experience, rather than enhance it.
Now, the reason I'm not a fan of most animes is because of the perverted 'sex-sells' moments, lots of episodes that have nothing to do with the story (filler), little action, bad fight scenes, ridiculous characters and scenarios, and just a lackluster story. If you watch the episodes that I tell you to watch, Mirai Nikki's main plot, main characters, and EVERYTHING is pretty amazing. However, episodes 3 through 21 focus a lot more on the sub plot and side characters. The side characters never seem to even question their actions, which prevents you from caring about them too much. And even worse, in those same episodes, the main characters keep doing things that deviate from their true selves; so, instead of empathizing and caring about the main characters, you'll actually keep yourself distant from them...which, you know, is the complete opposite of what you would want to do. As a whole, the series is still better than most, since there are no real filler episodes, and they manage to keep trickling out plot and some facts throughout. But it does suffer from the other things I hate about most animes, especially when it comes to the appearance of Eight (Ueshita Kamado). Why is her head 10 times bigger than anyone elses? She looks ridiculous, her appearance doesn't fit with the rest, and it really should have been changed.
I do realize that a lot of people like all those things that I hate about animes and you'll want to watch the whole thing. Or maybe you'll watch the episodes I told you to, and be curious about the rest of the show. Well, go ahead and watch it. If you do get discouraged throughout it by how the main characters keep flip-flopping and the side characters don't seem to have much of a conscience, just keep in mind that it gets better...much, much better. At first, you might find the first few episodes to be fine, but by the time you get into the late-teen episodes, I think that you'll agree that the main plot has been watered down quite a bit.
Episodes 1 and 2 inform you of the plot, and pretty much demonstrate how things are going to play out. Now when you skip to episode 22, you might be confused by what's going on, but honestly, a lot of what you're seeing was just introduced in that episode, and goes on to be explained. That's the thing about Mirai Nikki  the last several episodes do a really good job of explaining, making references, and wrapping up plot holes (all in a timely fashion), that you won't need prior knowledge of the whole series. And just so you know, episode 26 is not the final episode. There's a 2-part episode called Redial that was released separate from the rest of the series. Just look it up on YouTube and you can find it. Part 1 isn't very important; it pretty much just does a recap of the ending on episode 26, and then goes on to boring and sexual filler. You can just watch Part 2 and get all the information that you need.

COME BACK TO READ THIS PART AFTER YOU'VE WATCHED THE SHOW! I'M GOING TO DISCLOSE SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY OR MAY NOT WANT TO KNOW. SPOILER! LAST CHANCE TO STOP READING! SPOILER!

If you're like me, you might have wondered what happened to the third incarnation Yuki. Episode 26 and Redial cover what it's like for all the other characters in the third incarnation world, but I had watched the last several episodes twice, and I don't recall ever seeing or hearing much about the third incarnation Yuki. So I did some looking around and watched some parts again, and I found that I didn't pay close enough attention. In episode 26, when the third incarnation Yuno is sitting with her friends and looks out the window; it shows Yuki with his parents and a girl. In one of the episodes, Yuki had asked this girl out and was refused, but in this world not only did his parents stay together, but the girl accepted Yuki (weird how the girl looks so much like his mother). I guess I kept missing out on this since I was too busy listening to and reading what Yuno was saying. If you caught it, good for you...I somehow missed it twice :/
Lastly  I hate how Masumi Nishijima just blindly loved Minene Uryu right from the start. When they first meet (which it flashbacks to in episode 10), she's a wanted terrorist, but he treats her like a normal girl. She ends up shooting him and escaping. She then goes on to blow up children at the school in an attempt to kill Yuki. They then meet again in a hostage situation at a hospital, but he still treats her just fine. As things progress, it never comes up and he just loves her for being so damn...purple-haired or whatever it is that he likes. This is what I'm talking about when I said that the side characters don't seem to question anything. Right from the start, he loved her, and that was just how it's going to be. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad that there was a happy ending where she ended up changing and they had a mutual love and children, but their relationship should have started out with much more hate.

P.S. - As I write this, Attack On Titan has only 1 season out, and it's the best anime I have ever seen. You need to watch it. It's not perfect, but it is the best :)",1392508800,2,6411,4.441801189464741

5818434,5,B00DICPBP6,"I have to start off by saying that this is one of my all-time favorite animes! With that said the part one and part two sets are nicely presented, with each one containing an omake and a select episode commentary.  There were the standard, text less credits, promotional videos and trailers as well. My one complaint with this entire set is that it does not contain the redial ova, leaving you begging for more.  As for the anime itself I absolutely loved it: a mixture of disturbed, tragic, heartwarming and just plain funny moments befalls the entire cast throughout an emotional story that pulls you in and keeps you on your toes. I couldn't help but feel for a character even as I rooted for my favorite to kill them at that same moment. It should go without saying that this may not be a show for all audiences, wearing its TV-MA rating well from time to time. This show contains a fair amount of blood, violence, sex and fan service, though it wasn't to me in any way over the top and fits the shows feel well. A few other good marks I must say are that the animation is awesome. The soundtrack is filled with emotion and always fits the moment. All of this is paired with spot-on voice acting.  All things considered this anime has a great re-watch value!",1389484800,2,1262,4.431034482758621

5818437,4,B00DICPBP6,"Mirai Nikki revolves around the premise that a dying God decides he needs a successor.  Instead of choosing a worthy individual to sit the throne, he sagely chooses to decide the matter via a death match (because people who kill other people are the obvious candidates for godhead).  Each survival game candidate is given a diary that predicts the future to one degree or another.  Yuki, a young boy whose diary predicts the future around him in a rather general way, is our protagonist.

The show's pacing is spot-on, with plenty of action and character development.  Yuki's character will irritate many anime fans with his indecisiveness and general refusal (or extreme reluctance) to do anything cool or deadly for the first  of the show.  Instead, the lovely Gasai Yuno chops, stabs, blasts, and burns her way through Yuki's enemies--and some of his friends, too.  As with many viewers, Yuno was my favorite aspect of the show: a beautiful psychotic who was simultaneously the most complex and most exciting character in the entire series.  Yuno's performance in the episodes leading up to the grande finale (where Mirai Nikki unfortunately drops the ball) is close to perfect.

While Mirai Nikki is a very good anime, it's not five stars.  A particular viewer compared it favorably to Death Note, and while they are correct that the two animes share themes and plot devices, Death Note is the more cerebral and well-crafted experience (though both shows have their issues).  Yuki's transformation near the end of the story is really not believable.  Gasai Yuno is ALMOST amazing throughout.  Four stars.",1388707200,2,1608,5.018867924528302

It still follows it, but it just decided to end it right in the middle of what would be the final chapter. all in all it's fun and crazy.",1382745600,,398,3.925925925925926

8593512,5,B00DICPBP6,This was a fantastic series. Great story overall and satisfying ending. Most of how i define a good series is by how good the ending is. And this one has a great ending.,1445126400,,169,4.151515151515151
8593513,5,B00DICPBP6,"If you like Anime this is one of the best, Part two is just as good as part one which is saying something.  This is an excellent anime with a really good plot and a great cast of characters.  I would compare it very favorably to Death Note, Kill la Kill and DanganRonpa (the video).  Also, the English voice-over actors are very good.

I strongly recommend Future Diary.  Note, you don't want to watch this with young children around, lots of nudity and language.",1429920000,,463,4.464285714285714
