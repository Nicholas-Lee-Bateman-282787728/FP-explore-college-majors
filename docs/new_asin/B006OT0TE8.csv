8502327,3,B006OT0TE8,I bought this for Driller Killer and figured Drive in Massacre would be at least in the same league as the former. It was not even the same sport. Do Not WATCH Drive in Massacre!,1414195200,,178,4.114285714285714

8502329,1,B006OT0TE8,"these are two great horror films but the quality of this release is worse then any release of just about any movie out there. I have these on youtube with better picture quality. you cannot see anything that is happening
please do yourself a favor and research and find a copy with good quality",1405900800,,294,4.462962962962963
8502330,2,B006OT0TE8,"The product review states that ""these two original, gore-soaked features are finally together on the most disturbing double bill ever"" They're absolutely right, but the excitement of this double bill ends as quickly as it begins.

The ""Classic Splatter Pack"" contains two blood filled slasher flicks from the 1970's, Drive-In Massacre and The Driller Killer. Both films are presented on a single sided disc in full screen format. This DVD release is a slap in the face to any fan of these movies. Grind Global Media, the company responsible for this double feature DVD, didn't attempt to restore or remaster anything for this release at all. The video is barely viewable and the sound absolutely stinks!  The video image is extremely dark, grainy and riddled with lines, speckling and debris. The source material used for this release must have come from a worn out VHS bootleg. Buyer Beware!

The product review also goes on to say that ""after these two splatter classics you will need a shower, or a body bag!""  The only screaming heard from this release was over the extremely poor video & audio quality. The only body bag needed is for the DVD itself. This poor effort from Grind Global Media should be buried!",1332547200,8,1214,4.85024154589372
