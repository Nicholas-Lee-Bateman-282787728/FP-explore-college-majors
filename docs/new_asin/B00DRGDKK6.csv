5851236,3,B00DRGDKK6,This movie just about put me to sleep.  I had to watch it in portions.  It did get somewhat better near the end.  Very dull and boring.  I don't know even if Tom Hanks could pull this one off.,1383436800,3,192,3.8461538461538463
5851237,5,B00DRGDKK6,"Some people with VERY low IQ have written bad reviews about this movie. The script is well written (it was based on a novel, I believe), the directing is flawless and the acting is outstanding. Not to mention the scenery and the photography...amazing.
Some people have said the movie is depressing...Seriously?! The woman is isolated from the rest of the world and she doesn't even know why! That is a horrible situation to be in, like being stranded on an island in the middle of nowhere. So, instead of pointing out the obvious how about paying attention to what she writes on her diary? That's the voice of the author of the story, btw. Pay attention to the ending and you'll see that, despite all the bad things that happen, she's still hopeful of what the future will bring.",1383436800,3,779,4.611510791366906
5851238,2,B00DRGDKK6,"Some reviewers praised this film as a masterpiece. To me, it was a very depressing waste of time. The main character struck me as dull and unimaginative. She spent very little time in the film actually trying to find out about the wall around her, but spends a great deal of time just sitting around being depressed. She never tried using the rain or snow to ""see"" the boundaries of the wall. She sees two motionless humans that are just outside the wall, but they are never explained. Flora and fauna are plentiful in her walled off domain, but apparently no other humans. Near the end of the film, an antagonistic human enters her world, yet she never questions where he came from, or how she might find a way out. Watching this film was like trying to put together a puzzle with half of the pieces missing.",1383436800,5,809,4.472972972972973
5851239,3,B00DRGDKK6,"This film may have had some thought provoking moments, but...it was VERY depressing!  A lot of animals die in it, with some very sad scenes of the deaths & if you're an animal lover like me, it will be very disturbing.  But, I kept watching it, hoping to find some answers as to this woman's predicament.  However, it ends with no ending...as in, it just drops out!  You are left with sadness over the woman's plight & the death of these innocent animals, and with no answers as to what ends up happening to her or why this happened!  It is pretty pointless to watch & leaves you with some depressing scenes in your head.  I kind of wish I hadn't watched it!",1383350400,,658,4.308943089430894
5851240,1,B00DRGDKK6,Nice scenery but the story was terrible or rather nonexistent. Worse than that it was blah and depressing.

5851241,4,B00DRGDKK6,"This is a beautiful, haunting movie. Cut off from everyone and everything, a woman is forced to employ self-discipline and sheer will to survive. Outwardly, she is ill prepared for the circumstance she finds herself in. Inwardly, she is able to reach down into that place within herself that is strength. The seasons pass beautifully but in near silence. She is either in a utopia or a hell. It is a riveting performance, with a voice over narrative that is spare and deep.

Some scenes were overlong, and the movie itself overlong. The suspense built with nowhere to go and the ending was maddening. Perhaps that is why the movie is so haunting. It prompts introspection as well as sadness, and does bring to mind the unfair, distressing events that happen to people through no choice of their own. Still they go on, sometimes succeeding, sometimes not, and any happy endings in life are not to be taken for granted.",1382918400,,917,4.73125

5851244,4,B00DRGDKK6,"Directed by Julian P&ouml;lsler, award-winning German actress Martina Gedeck stars in this riveting, allegorical tale of survival set in the spectacular Austrian countryside.  Exquisite cinematography propels this puzzling and thoughtful story of isolation and its impact on the human spirit as it is forced to rejoin the breathtaking but indifferent natural world.

Naturally I thought of Stephen King's ""THE DOME"" (both the book and the cheap looking, seemingly endless CBS series with the god-awful music) as the movie began.  But this is a different take on a similar premise with superior satisfaction and rewards for the viewer.

Gedeck delivers a tour-de-force performance as she endures all kinds of physical and psychological challenges when she discovers, to her horror, that she is trapped behind an invisible, impenetrable wall in a remote mountain area. This compelling, mind-bending adventure that's seasoned with philosophical, psychological and sci-fi elements kept me involved.

Based on Marlen Haushofer's highly-praised 1962 novel (the only novel of her works to be translated into English), THE WALL is the story of Gedeck's unnamed character -- The Woman -- who is vacationing in the stunning Austrian mountains when an invisible wall suddenly and inexplicably encompasses the countryside and cuts her off from the civilization she left behind.  Though the blue sky, chirping birds and surrounding nature appear to be normal, The Woman is in fact cut of from all human contact and separated from the rest of the world.  With her loyal dog Lynx as a sole companion, The Woman becomes immersed and enmeshed in a pristine world hardly touched by civilization and ruled only by the laws of nature, which prove to be both benign and dangerous.  As she grapples with her bizarre circumstances, The Woman begins an inward journey of spiritual discovery and eventually transcendence.  At one point we hear her voice over narration (taken from her journal): ""I pity animals and I pity people, because they are thrown into this life without being consulted,"" she says. ""Maybe people are more deserving of pity, because they have just enough intelligence to resist the natural course of things.""",1379721600,30,2205,5.313218390804598
5851245,5,B00DRGDKK6,"""Die Wand"" is a 2013 Seattle International Film Festival entry from Germany (in English). It is directed by much-admired Julian Plsler (many awards and nominations throughout Europe) whose work is primarily seen on German television. Adapted from the classic novel by Marlen Haushofer, this is a masterful performance done almost in solitude by a wonderful actress.

A woman is going to visit some friends who drop her off at their cabin, then go back into town to buy some more supplies. Their dog Lynx stays with her, even though there is no love lost between her and the dog.

We are enthralled by:
  * Martina Gedeck (""Mostly Martha"" and ""The Lives of Others"") is the poor gal who, after taking the dog for a walk in the woods, finds herself trapped by an invisible wall and neither she nor the dog can get out. Her friends are nowhere to be seen and she is now absolutely alone except for Lynx.

This tour de force shows us what Ms. Gedeck can do with NO makeup, NO love story, NO telephones, NO car crashes and NO Computer Generated Imaging. (There ARE three gunshots.) Her solitude is almost palpable, she never speaks, the only narrative comes as a voiceover when she is writing in her journal on scraps of paper she has found in her friends' cabin. She first writes with a pen, then with pencil, and finally is down to a stub. I couldn't help but worry about her supply of bullets, kerosene and matches. Eventually, her main concern becomes how to keep her humanity.

Filmed in the area around Salzkammergut, Austria, the scenery is breathtaking, the weather is chilly, and her spectacular surroundings emphasize her isolation. A cat shows up, along with a cow, so this foursome becomes almost inseparable. Her survival instincts demand that she learn how to plant potatoes, gut a deer, milk a cow, help deliver a calf, cut hay for the winter, and shoot a gun. You should see the look on the dog's face the first time she shoots the gun and misses the deer!

BTW, both of those movies in brackets are HIGHLY recommended. Get all of them from Amazon.",1376524800,34,2058,4.6219178082191785

5851266,5,B00DRGDKK6,"The movie is beautifully done in many ways. I'd like to mention just one aspect of the movie; the main theme of the whole story. We humans are blocked by the layer of so called human civilization. To see the reality we have to isolate ourselves from what is called ""human."" And we may be able to see directly the truth that is free from all of those we value dearly. The main character went through the process of isolating herself completely from the human civilization and was reborn to be part the reality. The thought of her transformation and what she or one becomes after that transformation haunts me and makes me shiver. One of her monologues says """"Maybe people are more deserving of pity (than other animals), because they have just enough intelligence to resist the natural course of things."" It reminds me of a quote from Tao Te Ching,""Heaven and earth are ruthless, and treat the myriad creatures (including humans) as straw dogs.""",1433376000,,944,4.692771084337349

5851269,3,B00DRGDKK6,"I watched this movie last night on a hunch and found it to be sad, somber and haunting. The wall is a barrier that has appeared overnight and shut in a mountain area where our heroine had the misfortune to find herself. It is based on a 1963 novel of the same name by Marlene Haushofer and one can only wonder to what extent it may have influenced the writing of Under the Dome by Stephen King. There are clear paralells that suggest a creative relationship.

The movie features Martina Gedeck as the woman who finds herself trapped by the wall. Ms. Gedeck turns in a powerful performance that held my attention the entire move. The direction, by Julian P&ouml;lsler, is focused and effectively builds a feeling of lonely helplessness and bravery as the woman struggles to deal with her new reality.

The scenery is beautiful, majestic, lonely and a bit overwhelming as this story of the woman's strange isolation develops. While most questions are left unanswered, such as where did the wall came from and what about the people outside the wall we do see the emergence of a strength in the woman which may enable her to survive this ordeal. There are some jarring moments which seem to come out of nowhere; I'll say no more about that to avoid any spoilers.

The movie stops, it does not end in the sense of a reasonable resolution to the mystery of the wall; if you're looking for answers there you will not find them. I have not read the book so I have no idea if the book answers any of those questions.

This is a memorable mood movie with a lot of camera time on mood shots which are very well done for that matter. I suspect you'll not forget this one for a long time. For some this may be a movie you'll want in your collection; for others, one viewing may be enough; I suggest you rent it before you buy it; it left me feeling a little depressed.",1426204800,,1855,4.399416909620991
5851270,3,B00DRGDKK6,"Okay, story and ending a little vague. Why the wall appeared and what happened to the lady?",1424390400,,91,4.411764705882353
5851271,5,B00DRGDKK6,"I was alerted to this movie by someone who had commented on my Amazon review of ""Night Train to Lisbon"" (2013) which featured Martina Gedeck (Best Foreign Film Oscar winner, ""The Lives of Others"").  Here, she is the only human actor of any consequence.  I debated whether to watch it.  After all, it tanked in U. S. markets when it was originally released.  But the story seemed compelling.

Gedeck plays a woman who with 2 travelling companions, drives deep into the Austrian mountain side for a short respite from their normal life.  We don't get any information about any of this.  As soon as they arrive at the cottage, the companions hike back into the village to get supplies.  The woman (Gedeck) stays behind along with the couple's dog, Lynx.  The location of the cottage has only one way in and one way out, so when the couple doesn't return, The Woman (no name) and Lynx walk a ways to see if they had trouble.  They literally run into an invisible wall that cannot be penetrated.  There is no explanation.

The woman returning to the cottage finds another couple, seemingly frozen but again, behind the invisible barrier.  The film is told in flashback by the woman who has obviously been there a while and is making hand written entries into a journal, which she calls a ""report.""  The narration feels very much like the novel is being read, but with motion pictures replacing a broader written explanation.  This is certain to drive some viewers crazy.  But I thought it was innovative and well written.

As time and the seasons come and go, the woman becomes very close to Lynx and he to her.  The woman and the dog discover a cow roaming the meadow and take her in.  Later she delivers the pregnant cow's bull.  A couple cats find their way to the cottage.  The woman has no particular survival skills and by the look of her, isn't involved in a profession that requires manual labor.  And then there are the eloquent words she puts in the report which indicates she is well educated.  But she has some food, tools, rifles and wood.

Directed and written by Julian Polsler, adapted from Marlen Haushofer's novel, the film shows the impact of isolation and the will to survive.  The companionship between the woman and Lynx will warm dog lover's hearts.  The film also shows some beautiful scenery as the seasons change from pleasant summers, to colorful falls, to cold but picturesque winters and new beginnings in the spring.  Bernd Jungmair's classical score seems the perfect accompaniment to the film.  The movie isn't for everyone and never provides enough clues to figure out what has happened.  After a while, I just forgot about the wall and went along for the mesmerizing ride.  I loved it.",1423699200,2,2714,4.688559322033898

5851274,5,B00DRGDKK6,"This excellent film questions humanity where there is no one else to reflect upon. The main character is alone on one side of a wall while the world outside of the wall appears to be looping a few seconds. She survives with the need to keep the dog, Lynx, and a handful of other animals alive.

This movie is a philosophical look at what drives us. The question of why do we get up in the morning is asked, but not answered. For the MC she has the need to take care of those animals. In the beginning of her time at the cabin that is the only thing that keeps her moving.

The actress does a brilliant job of showing emotions without speaking. The dog is also really excellent. 10/10 would recommend (If you like existential crisis movies).",1420329600,,740,4.316546762589928
5851275,5,B00DRGDKK6,"Reading the plot summary gave me no indication of just how enjoyable and thought provoking this film about unexpectedly living a life cut off from other humans turned out to be.  Most importantly, it is free of cliches or conventions.  There are a million perspectives, and layers that the viewer can ponder.  It doesn't necessarily impose it's own conclusions. The scenery is beautiful and constantly changing.  You get a genuine sense of the transformations (both positive and otherwise) this environment forges on this character.  You also cannot help but draw larger inferences about the youthful and naive pleasures that everyone loses (more gradually) as they face varied indifference of nature.",1419552000,,701,5.336363636363636
5851276,5,B00DRGDKK6,"Martina Gedeck is pretty amazing in this somber meditative look at a woman trapped in almost complete isolation, yet she doesn't get the chance to portray a very wide range of emotion. I'm not even sure what the meaning of the story is - other than a magnified look at our existential condition (although maybe the meaninglessness of it all is the point) - but it is an engrossing story, beautifully set, lushly filmed and meditatively paced.

Most of the time Gedeck narrates (in English) a monologue that could just as comfortably fit into a Werner Herzog documentary. And like a Herzog film there is something magical here, revealing a depth of experience and feeling that is rare in less extraordinary circumstances.

But their dog senses something and won't go past a certain point and goes back to the cabin with their female friend. The couple continues on their walk...and never returns.

5851280,4,B00DRGDKK6,"An immensely thought-provoking film that may leave viewers in a contemplative mood due to the mystery and unpredictability that director Julian Polsler and writer Marlen Haushofer invoke in the film based on Haushofer's novel The Wall.  What may speak much louder as the film begins, the beautiful landscape captured by the exceptional cinematography and then after, main actress Martina Gedeck ""the woman"" who retells the story of when she first arrived at a quaint alpine cottage owned by Hugo Ruttlinger (Karl Heinz Hackl) a collector and hypochrondiac and his wife Luise (Ulrike Beinfold).  What appears to be a normal excursion, time away from distractions, takes a different turn after the Ruttlingers do not return from their afternoon jaunt to the village and the moment Gedeck falls asleep and an ominous and prelude of scenes that follow and open the door into the surreal and semi-fantasy tones of the film.  Although no details are shown in the film, something does not feel or look right as the camera pans through the lakeside and cliffs by night's end.

As the film progresses, one noticeable part is the lack of dialogue.  However, the first six minutes of the film has brief interactions between Gedeck and the Ruttlingers, afterwards, Gedeck does all of the speaking in the form of flashbacks as she recollects how her dilemma began; learning that the road that leads to the village and other routes have been blocked by a transparent wall.  And so begins her journey to survive since she was now isolated from anything outside of her surroundings, except for the cottage and limited access to the forests, freshwater, and cliffs.  Besides having no choice but to live a life of solitude, Gedeck writes in her journal with as little paper that was available, and she has animal companions, a dog Lynx, two cats, one called Pearl, and a cow named Bella and a young bull she gave birth to.  With the necessary resources to attempt to live a life day by day, Gedeck lives with precautions with every little unusual occurrence despite the calm and relaxing environment in which she lives.  And by the concluding scenes, the film will leave the viewer with shock and awe as well as gasps.

After watching The Wall, one may imagine what it may be like to live or to experience what the woman had to endure.  Several comparisons resonate with this film that range from the production and creative style of Ingmar Bergman, films or stories ""Cross Creek,"" ""The Yearling,"" or ""Robinson Crusoe""  All of these examples show the challenges that man may face with nature, survival, and mortality.  There is no doubt, a greater and deeper meaning may leave viewers with food for thought.",1413590400,,2690,4.885714285714286

5851296,5,B00DRGDKK6,"THE WALL (Austrian, 2012; based on Marlen Haushofer's 1963 novel published in German as DIE WAND)  is a thought-provoking ""premise story"" about the end of the human race.

The unnamed central character of THE WALL is a widow in her forties (wonderfully played by Martina Gedeck) who was on vacation with her cousin and his wife at their Alpine cottage and who went to bed rather than joining them for evening drinks in the nearby village. When she awoke the next morning, they had not returned, and when she tried walking to the village with their dog, she discovered that a massive transparent wall separated her from the entire outside world. Gazing through it, she could see that all animal life there, including human life, seems to have mysteriously perished overnight. Only she and the insects, birds, foxes, deer, and other animal life on her side of the wall are still alive.

Until the final few minutes, where a new element is introduced, the audio portion of this film consists chiefly of the widow's voice-over, conveying her vividly detailed accounts of her struggles to survive on a day-to-day and year-to-year basis, her speculations about what happened to the outside world, her memories and occasional mourning about her earlier life, her illnesses and injuries, her loving relationships with the dog, several cats, a cow, and a young bull, her increasing appreciation for the natural world around her, her reflections on the nature of human life and the nature of the human race, and her gradual transformation into a person who can accept her new role as apparently the last person on earth.

As viewers and listeners, we admire her great courage, her coping skills, her intellect and imagination, and most of all her generous heart and loving nature as she interacts with her household animals and the animals outdoors. Also as viewers and listeners, we speculate about and attempt to solve the mysteries WITHIN the film (what has caused the deaths outside the wall? who or what is responsible? how did the wall come into existence?) and the mystery OF the film itself (what is the chief purpose of its director, Julian Roman Plsler, for telling this tale?).

Suspense is created by dozens of spoken flash-forwards that inform us about the deaths of several of her beloved animals, and we wonder when and exactly how these will occur. Especially in the book, a few of these flash-forwards provided us with one or two specific details that led us to suspect that another human being MAY still be alive ... somewhere inside the protective wall. And if this is so, we wondered, HOW will the woman react?

I shall not give any ""spoiler"" answers here. Instead, let me just say that my hypothesis is that THE WALL seems to be a ""cautionary parable"" like Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHT-FOUR and Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD and Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451 and scores of other serious science fiction/speculative fiction works. It seems designed to warn us, like a lighthouse, to change course before it is too late.

As such, if I were giving it a letter grade, in my judgment it deserves a solid ""A"".  Incidentally, I gave the novel THE WALL a ""B+"", but the film version has the advantage of being shorter and more tightly organized AND a bit more intense because of its visual and vocal elements: we SEE the Alpine valley and meadow and forest, we SEE the woman, we SEE her animals, we SEE their joys and sorrows, and through it all we HEAR the tone of her marvelous voice. As a slight trade-off, I do think that the sheer length of the book helped make it somewhat clearer what the message of the author was. (Of course people viewing a DVD at home have advantages that people in movie theaters lack: for one, they can re-watch any scenes they wish, as many times as they wish.)

If anyone would care to see a more specific statement about the A-to-Z ""plot"" of this novel, I have provided one in the ""COMMENTS"" section below.

NOTE ON THE TRANSLATION: The DVD comes with a German audio track and an English audio track. It also has optional English subtitles. I have not made a thorough comparison of the audio tracks, but the English translations seems excellent. What is a little peculiar is that the English audio track and the English subtitles differ in several thousand small ways ... even though both are conveying essentially the same meanings.",1393977600,10,4355,4.779255319148936

5851302,5,B00DRGDKK6,"I came to this 2013 filmed version on the back of reading Marlen Haushofer's 1968 published book. Indeed, the republication of the book, and its reaching a new and wider audience, has come precisely because of this film. We appear to have a virtuous circle going on, for once, in the relationship between the single writer's vision and the collaborative vision of the film.

Normally wary of film adaptations of books which have strongly resonated,  I might have passed Die Wand by, except for the fact that thoughtful reviews re-iterated the powerful sense evoked by the book, speaking of the patience, depth and meditative quietude and despair in the film. I'm so glad I trusted the sensibilities of the reviewers, because with this film, is something which deepens my earlier reading of the book - and the book itself is deepened by the dynamics of vision, sound and embodiment of the narrator in Martina Gedeck's deep performance The film, directed by Julian Roman Polsler runs for 108 minutes, and can be watched with German or English narration, and is also subtitled. I chose to have Gedeck's voiceover, and English subtitles. A performance of this truth needs no other interpreter getting between actor and viewer, in my opinion.

The word which the film owns is `reverence' - not a sterile reverence for Haushofer's strange and disturbing book about the only woman left alive, in a lonely landscape, after some cataclysmic event has turned all life outside her Alpine valley to stone - but a reverence for the living world itself, for authenticity, and for, in Haushofer's words, love as the rational choice. Not the gushy gushy of sentimentality, but a respect for the nature of matter, of the living and the dying of things, of the tangled, interconnecting web which human being alone have choices about - often taking the wrong paths of enmity and hatred.

Certainly this is not a film to satisfy if what is wanted is a `what happens next' as, like the book, itself, a journal written by the narrator over four months as she looks back over her two years since `the end', as she waits, implacably, for her own, time is looked forward to and back. There is no fast cutting, there is the slow pace of the breathing landscape, the camera and the actor observing the stillness. In this, it reminds me of the film [[ASIN:B0024RV3E4 Into Great Silence], an unspoken filmic observance of life in a Carthusian Monastery.

The transformation of the city dwelling narrator, as Gedeck inhabits her (it is a performance of inhabitation and revelation rather than of demonstration) in her designer cream frock, full faced and jittery, to the shorn haired figure, like one of the Fates, staring into the inevitability of whatever new or old may befall, is haunting.

The spacious empty soundtrack, except for Gedeck's voiceover of occasional phrases from her journal, and the natural sounds, is perfectly deepened by the underlining, sparing use of a Bach partita, melancholy and haunting, perfectly balanced in its plenitude and its emptiness.

Forgive the purpling prose, this/these, (film and book, book and film) are fully what they are, to be experienced by their next reader/viewer, who will enter into their own relationship with both film and book",1391904000,2,3253,4.946886446886447

5851305,3,B00DRGDKK6,"I could tell without doing research that the novel this was based on was written in the 1960s. A quick google search confirmed my suspicion.
This is a variation the (then) popular apocolypse/everybody dead but me thing fostered by the advent and threat of nuclear weapons.
The premise is simply that a woman finds herself isolated by the sudden appearance of an invisible wall. She surmises that everyone else is dead. She survives by planting crops and hunting. The film deals primarily with her inner dialog regarding how to mentally cope with her new reality. It fails almost entirely at this owing to a complete failing to offer the viewer reason or desire to suspend disbelief. There are too many unanswered questions to foster any sense of reality. The appearance of the magic wall and the women's complete failure to refer to her pre-wall life cause too many questions in the viewers mind. The appearance of the thing that fosters the major events later in the film is as puzzling and magic as the wall, leaving the viewer wondering ""where the heck did that come from"" rather than being impressed by the turn of plot.
With all of the above said, this was beautifully filmed and well acted, so much so that it is worth watching just for those attributes.
Perhaps the book does a better job on engaging the reader, but given the subject matter and the time period I suspect it would simply be a well done writing exercise that reveals more about the 1960s concern with apocolypse rather than the character study it would like to be.",1390694400,2,1537,4.696296296296296

5851311,5,B00DRGDKK6,"In its considerations of solitude, the natural world's dominance, time and season (life cycle of all things). I prefer the immobilized face of The Woman, Martina Gedeck, extraordinary in her restraint.  The storyline has been written of in reviews below. My response to the film to which I've attached five stars, is for risk-taking, for exploring in near-silence not world -- but life, time, season, cycle. The Woman arrives ambiguously along a perilous route through a landscape both real and surreal (if you perceive it that way), expressionless. She might be in any vehicle traveling to a vanishing point. It's all foreshadowed: a man's hands at the wheel. Another figure one cannot make out.. Already,, this is the encapsulated universe The Woman is to experience. As with a circle, the viewer rounds the various checkpoints of not only human perception, but canine perception. We are given a gift of dual seeing -- one,
capable of expressing in dream and interior life the journey of soul's travail, the other, compatriot, intuiting. The cow, the calf, the cat... the trees, sun, fog, snow, rain -- think of them as panoramic canvas on which the viewer may play out a cinematic reel according to the light within. Spiritual, if you think so. I propose, grounded in the real, which is not to say amazed, reverent. Tenacity, resilience, invention, I experienced them as a primitive might. The Woman does not know her fate. We are not given to know ours -- only the trajectory. Call it the mordant glow where there is no path. I think more of Dante, than Crusoe. Self-examination in a woods of our own making.  In the silence one may happen to hear a voice and hear it resonate forever. Through The Woman's eyes unblinking, we too are observers at the pane, consequentially expressionless before a larger pane. Any word then is excessive. Intermittently we may hear an excerpt of music orchestrated by the writer's hand. Do we hear? or think we hear wind, the crack of a branch, a gun?  There is magnitude in the small. Do we underestimate the small? This is essentially a film about existential solitude. Will. The indifference of nature that has no ability to perceive. Snow, fog, silent secret weathers in which Lynx, the dog, mirrors our own human empathy, sorrowing.

5851318,3,B00DRGDKK6,"Isolation is a very rich template for a film.  The varying degrees of isolation can bring to the fore very different aspects of the situation and can offer us intelligent character portraits of how one overcomes the depressive nature of isolation.  There are so many shades to a human being, that coming under the spell of this very condemning circumstance can cast a kaleidoscope of possibilities.

In other words; in the right hands the possibilities are endless.

I had heard a lot of great things about The Wall.  There has been a lot said about Martina Gedecks performance, some calling it a tour-de-force and really labeling it one of the finest performances put to film this year.  I have only seen her in a handful of things, but she left a lasting impression on me when I saw her in 2006s The Lives of Others and so I was intrigued greatly by the prospect of her completely consuming me once again.  She has such raw talent, and this premise felt so organic and so capable of drawing out the best in a talented actress.

Sadly, I found this to be extremely underwhelming, and for the most part I feel as if it was Gedecks fault.  While I am all for subtlety, this performance felt so hopelessly one-note that I was begging for her to break character and smash a plate!

The story follows a woman who ventures into the wilderness with an elderly couple for vacation.  The couple goes hiking, leaving this woman alone in the cabin.  When she eventually ventures out with her trusty dog Lynx, she finds that she has become trapped by an indescribable wall.  She cant see the wall, but she can feel it, and it continues to tighten its grip on her.  So, she is alone with her dog and a few other animals.  As she learns to fend for herself (hunting, gathering, defending) she narrates her story as she writes it down in the confines of her world.  Her situation is never explained and her countenance never changes.

That is a problem.

I have no issue with the ambiguity of her situation.  It is dire and supernatural, of course, but the mystery that surrounds it is actually part of the films impact and so I am drawn to that aspect.  I also found the haunting cinematography to be key to the films overall impact.  The film is just lush and gorgeous, but it always feels slightly dangerous thanks to the key use of lighting and natural elements (that fog).  Still, the remarkably one-note delivery from Gedeck never struck me as natural.  She is so downtrodden (even in the outset, before she is alone) that the true nature of her situation is lost.  We never grow in her desperation but always feel held back by her complacency.  Nothing affects her.  She is void of any emotional connection to her surroundings, and when she shows a brief glimpse of some sort of emotion (the whole gun scene in the very end) it is for a mere moment and then gone, without real explanation.  She reminds me a lot of Ryan Goslings monotone performance in Only God Forgives, and I hated that one too.

5851328,5,B00DRGDKK6,"Original title was Die Wand and is based on the book by Marlen Haushoffer. The plot is pretty simple in that three people go to a hunting lodge up in the mountains of Austria. Frau is left when her companions go to the village for provisions; she falls asleep and in the morning realise they have not returned. After a while she sets out to find them only to discover she has been surrounded by an impenetrable yet invisible wall.

Once the shock has worn off she has to take stock and all she really has in the loyal dog Lynx. She is telling her story through the words she has written in her journal and as she slowly runs out of paper we are brought closer to the present day. What follows in a haunting, mesmerising and totally enthralling film. Though the dialogue is minimal, as you would expect having no one to talk to, the narrative is just so compelling it carries the story. The acting by Martina Gedeck  (The Lives of others) is amazing, the animals were pretty impressive too, especially Lynx. There are some scenes of apparent animal cruelty so please be advised as I know that can be upsetting.

This though is simply beautiful, a story pared to the bone yet done so leaving only what is essential and it is a visual feast. All sci  fi has to have an element of the existential and this is all about the basic drive that keeps us going, even when it all seems futile. In German with good subs, directed by Julian Polsler who seems to have done most of his work for TV, I think that with this unexpectedly brilliant piece of cinema he can say he is more than ready to bring something unique and special to the big screen.",1385769600,3,1635,4.333333333333333

5851330,3,B00DRGDKK6,"I'm not sure what I was expecting when I ordered this movie and still not sure after watching it.  This is maybe a little like Stephen King's Dome without all the drama.  (Or, should I say, any drama.)  I watched this on my computer and for the most part was more absorbed in playing games than watching the movie. There isn't much story but the scenery is beautiful. I usually don't mind movies that don't answer all the questions for you by the end but this might an exception. Although, I'm not sure I care.  It was sad when my favorite character.... well I can't give anything away.",1385683200,,586,4.398148148148148
5851331,1,B00DRGDKK6,"With an interesting premise, and beautiful scenery, I was sucked in.  A tail of self discovery for a woman isolated in the wilderness, a mysterious invisible wall (The Dome anyone?), I figured ""why not?""  I knew that a narrated style movie such as this would be a little art-housey but this one was too far.  I'd warn that there are spoilers ahead in this review, but seeing as the film is pre-spoiled I shall not bother.

To sum things up so you don't have to waste your time, the entire movie is narrated by this woman who is writing down her experiences of the last few years of being trapped by a large invisible barrier inside an Austrian country side.  She can see a few neighbors mysteriously frozen in place, though other elements of the environment, such as flowing water, seem to continue outside of her bubble.  She fends for herself taking care of livestock and farming inside her prison and writing very flowery and often poetic phrases about her lonely existence and how calm she is beginning to feel.  This goes on for a few years, a time much shorter than watching the movie felt, until a mysterious man miraculously shows up one summer day to hack her young bull to death and kill her dog, the only friend she has.  Then she runs out of paper and concludes her tail.  The End.

The actress, without having many lines, was quite good I thought.  Like Tom Hanks in Cast Away.  The scenery was also spectacular, and that's all I can say positively about it.  My first real complaint is that it seems she is going on a personal journey with her isolation and introspection.  Unfortunately, we the audience, cannot go on it with her has we have no idea who she was before.  Was she like Tom Hank's Cast Away character and too busy and hectic to realize the life he was leading?  Was she a narcissist?  A bad person?  Hated animals?  Getting over a lost love?  We just don't know.  All we know is that she came up to a secluded hunting loge with a couple, even though she hated hunting, and didn't want to go into town with them right after they arrived.  We know nothing about her, her relationships, her reasons, or her purpose.  This made a lot of the dramatic introspection she was narrating pointless.  I guess we also know that she somehow had enough basic farming knowledge to survive even though she clearly stated she was weak and unaccustomed to that type of work.

I also found her lack of curiosity about the wall disturbing.  I take that she couldn't go too far away from the cow, as it needed tending, but after the initial shock wore off she didn't seem to want to do things like dig under the wall, find out how big it was, or find out if others existed in it (fires, smoke signals, etc...).  She just accepted it and her situation and  moved on with her potato harvesting.

To end the way it did felt like a cheap emotional ploy.  Let's kill off her best friend, the dog, out of the blue by having a mysterious man show up.  Who was this man?  Where did he come from?  Why was he there?  Was he just insane or did he have a purpose?  Unless he was totally off his rocker wouldn't his first impression upon coming across the logging and domesticated animals of someone else after 3 years be more ""yea I'm not alone!!!"" rather than ""let me axe this cow and dog to death""?  If he was insane then how did he last so long though the harsh winters?  Wouldn't her reaction likewise be more to find out where he came from, where the wall ends, if others are there, etc... than just to shut herself off in her little house?

Finally, the abrupt ending  without any questions being answered left a bad taste in the mouth.  Don't tell me about how you get to make up your own conclusions, as that's just lazy storytelling.  We find out nothing about the wall, what her future is like, if the world survives, nothing.  I finished the movie asking what was the point and why did I ever waste my time on this?",1385510400,12,3923,4.376731301939058
5851332,4,B00DRGDKK6,"The acting is mesmerizing, but the chronology is quite difficult and disconcerting. There is no logical explanation for the wall, except as one is isolated by his or her own thinking and situation. The scenery was wonderful and inviting, even in the starkness of the snow and frozen frames of mind and eye. I wished for a better resolution, but I am thinking that the white crow was a metaphor for human discovery and final contentment with the ways things are, things that cannot ever be changed.

Anyways, it is a very psychological depressing movie, so amp up on the anti-depressants before watching it.  Death is justified in the circle of life...as are births, happiness and a deep sadness the woman can only write about.  The woman turns out to be quite a smart survivalist, a hunter, a shooter, a farmer, a livestock tender.  And best friend to a dog no one wanted along to begin with.

This movie is ridiculous and for anybody trying to make it sound deep or metaphorical....its not. Spoiler alert: A lady went to a cabin, when she woke up a large glass bubble had surrounded her and a few miles around her in her sleep.  Basically no escape and from what she can see everybody outside of this bubble died overnight...what? WTC?  She has a few animals and no other contact.  She learns to fend for herself and survive.  The whole movie is basically her narrating while she is journaling this experience.  There is no answer about this glass bubble.  There is no answer about if the outside world still exists or what happened.  There is no answer as to why a neighbor is standing there frozen outside of this bubble through the whole movie.  There is absolutely no resolution and no answers.  She just accepts this bubble of glass and sits in a room being depressed journaling it.  I had expected a rescue, possibly an eventual escape, maybe somebody that got in that could update what happened and why she was stuck there with these glass walls, possibly a guy that would be a love interest,  Nothing.  You do not get an answer for anything.

At first, it was interesting to see how this woman coped with her existence.  Then, the writer started pulling sucker punches.  The sucker punches serve no purpose except to make the viewer feel upset.  They aren't presented in a way that moves the story along or provides explanation.  I'm OK with gut wrenching stories, but I felt like the writer was being manipulative.

5851343,4,B00DRGDKK6,"The topic of a person alone in the wilderness is not new. Yet this movies story was moving, and as another reviewer mentioned, it has many levels, the psychological, the allegorical and spiritual implications of what it means to be alone, who we allow ourselves to become in our aloness and our connection to nature. The womans bond to her animals was at first a prison of obligations that later turned into her greatest love. The animals, with their constant joy, lack of worries and loyal devotion saved her by giving her a reason to live. And deep love, as the beloved author Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings wrote in Cross Creek, ""...is a commitment to shared sorrow, even as to shared joy.""

 As I watched this movie my thoughts kept racing in different directions.  I once lived alone in a forest, and although not cut off from civilization, could relate to living in the wilderness, the raw beauty, the mental and physical challenges, the communion with earth.

 As a psychotherapist I also work with many individuals that could relate, the broken-hearted, the divorced, the widows and aged and those that live alone and have no family. I kept thinking about the many people that could identify with her situation, who feel alone even in the busy midst of civilization and all its trappings- who never stop long enough to truly discover themselves.  And as a bereavement counselor for pet parents who have lost their pets, and as an animal lover, the loving scenes and the tragic scenes with her beloved pets were expertly portrayed.  Hard to watch was the deer that was shot-I believe that was real- and the only negative in an otherwise good movie, if indeed a live animal was killed.

 All in all it is a moving and beautiful movie that draws you in and leaves you wondering and thinking. And its true, that getting back to our nature has the potential to transform us. How, its strictly up to each person.

She managed ... day after day ... as best as she could ,with love she could share with her 3 animals she had as companion .
Until it changed ... and then she had to manage keep going again ... until ...not knowing what awaits ...maybe until her own end comes..
Imagine anybody in that situation ... some people who would be jailed like that,not knowing what is going on ,would get crazy and violent ,
like that man at the end of movie ,who unfortunately enters her life there as tragically and sadly :( ... He did not manage ...but she did,even in
situation as painful as that, when she lost her only friend and soul mate in that dog  ... so tragical ...
I certainly seen myself in her skin in such situation,and it was even unthinkable,unimaginable for me ,how I would feel,what I would do ... but I could feel her .
I am nature lover ,animal lover and I think I could get connected with only nature ,and such spectacular nature,as she did ,but I would suffer from loneliness of good human company.
Interesting psychological movie ... could have more other plots ,what actually happened ...like some explanation of invisible wall ,maybe being
some kind of time loop, to find herself after tragedy from past ... and be actually jailed inside her own world in her head ... or something similar
But even story about being just simply closed behind that wall for unknown reason ,without knowing what happened to people on other side
and just live as best as could,keep living ,survive  ...

8596675,2,B00DRGDKK6,"I'll start with the good: They build up a LOT of tension about a particular character in this movie. You're left wondering if the thing has already happened or not. It's a real tease and the only reason I stuck through the whole movie. It was VERY engaging waiting for this tension to break.

Now the bad. Spoiler alert: She gave up trying to find a way out of her situation VERY quickly. Day two I believe. She tried two things: Banging on the wall and driving a car into it. Without a seatbelt and she bangs her head. She didn't explore the edges. She didn't look to see how the river kept flowing. She didn't try to dig under it or go over it. She didn't even try burning it. She just crashed her car into it and accepted her fate. She even acknowledged that the other side may have been open. And it turns out that if she had bothered to explore the area she could have had a much less lonely life. Banging her head on the steering wheel probably caused some brain damage or something.

There's LONG sections of this movie that are her just standing/sitting/laying there and music playing. If you cut those out you'd have about a 30 minute long movie. Yeah some of the scenery was nice I guess but come on.

Letting the kitten go outside knowing it wasn't suited for the woods made me think about her potential brain damage again. WHY?!

The guy trapped in the wall with her had NO reason to kill her bull. That part made no sense. You'd think he would be so excited to see an area clearly inhabited by another human that he'd sit on the deck crying until she showed up. This whole situation left me feeling very unsatisfied. It did make me think about the white crow.

Lets do some freshmen media analysis:
There's a murder of crows in her area and one is an albino. It's been rejected by the rest of the flock and she relates to its loneliness. She likes to think there may be another white crow out there that may find her crow so they can be together. My first thought was that they'd reject each other because they don't know they are white and they'd look at the other crow like it was a freak. Now think about how finding another human worked out for her! Woah...",1506902400,2,2174,4.2798053527980535

I noticed that there was a movie based on it so I went and rented it. The DVD doesn't have any  extras, just the trailer for the film and an English language audio track and subtitles.

I haven't read the book yet, so I can't compare the movie to it. The movie is about two-hours long and very slow paced - the majority of dialog spoken is a voice over describing what the woman has written in her report journaling the events of what has happened to her and how she has survived till now. This is a very dreary movie - which depending on whether you like that sort of thing or not , that is a good or bad thing. Personally, I liked the movie. I was constantly imagining what I might have done in a similar situation.
