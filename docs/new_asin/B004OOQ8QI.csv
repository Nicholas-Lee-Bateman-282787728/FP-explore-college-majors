8437244,5,B004OOQ8QI,This video helped me see clearly the path that I would rather walk than the one I was on. This story shows you that sometimes it is easy to get lost in the shadows of others and loose track of your true self. The best part is that the end of the video is not the end but the beginig.,1300838400,2,283,3.7333333333333334
8437245,5,B004OOQ8QI,"After featuring Kay Kopit on my National Talk Show, Recovery Radio back in 2003, I was deeply touched. In Kay's film ""I Survived"" Kay takes the risk of speaking out and shedding much needed light.  It is by remaining silent that we perpetuate dysfunction, misunderstanding and increase stigma.  Kay Kopit uses this film as a tool to expose herself and her feelings about a very difficult time in her life, unfortunately a familiar situation more common that society chooses to admit.

She does so with sincerity, honesty, tears, humor and an amazing sense of hope. By sharing her pain and experiences with the world she continues to heal herself and gives others strength to do the same. A revolutionary way to use film indeed.

When watching, you will experience the intimate story of an incredible woman who truly DID survive and carried on to flourish!
I found the film ""I Survived"" inspirational, uplifting and very powerful.

Thank you Kay ~<3",1299888000,2,948,4.9

As others have, I saw parts of my life in her journey.  I also know firsthand how difficult it is to recognize being in an unhealthy primary relationship and then to take steps to separate from it.

Although Kay is not a mental health professional, her journey will empower others to seek help in learning how to make healthy relationship choices.  She continues her outreach with her Art & Soul Inspirational Cards (also available on Amazon).  Collection One: Transformation is available now and I understand a second collection is in development.

Thanks, Kay!!!",1299110400,2,753,4.976

When I saw Kay's story I said to myself,"" I hope people see this because when you feel you life is going bad there is always someone out there that has it ten times worse than you."" Sometimes people have to go through things in life in order to be who they are now.

It's not an enhanced Lifetime movie, but a true story about championing, defeating  and reclaiming a life that had been devastated multiple times.  Through her story, Kay Kopit inspired me to take control of and triumph over past issues  that clung to my heart.  I strongly recommend you buy this documentary. If you are at a crossroad in your life watching it will awaken your heart and mind making you look within and at the people who are in your life.",1298332800,,524,4.602150537634409
