8743848,4,B019479EQU,I really enjoyed the pictures and the details about the people that made the Gold Rush very interesting.,1517875200,,104,4.833333333333333
8743849,1,B019479EQU,"What trash, yes the pioneers mostly died from accidental gun shot wounds & the Americans stole land from Mexico. We concurred the land as do all nations that grow in size, I mean look at Ancient Rome or G.B.
It's a damned good thing we concurred the land from Mexico, otherwise we'd have the drug cartels even closer than our back yard. UGH!
It's like some millennial wrote this trash, ""America bad, America racists!"" ""Need to find a safe space pronto!""",1514592000,,453,4.604938271604938
8743850,3,B019479EQU,"The regular mispronunciations of less commonly used words were my first hint that this doesn't have the attention to detail, narrative skill, depth, or original research of a more professionally made documentary like those from the BBC or Ken Burns.  It's more like an audiobook of an american high school history textbook's section on the Gold Rush, combined with appropriate background imagery from stock images that are freely available online.

It's informative and free on Prime Video, but it contains about the same information as the ""California Gold Rush"" wikipedia page, which can be read in a small fraction of the 5 hours the documentary runs.  In fact, many of the images used for slow pans throughout the video are the exact same ones on the wikipedia page.",1503446400,,770,5.0
8743851,3,B019479EQU,"It ok. More for the classroom. Good for teaching kids. Although as a minor I disagree with some of the stuff. Of course it does have a slight Environmental wackadoodle take on things. Always find this quite hypocritical since environmentalist continue to use gold and silver in all the technology that they love and adore. I guess they just would rather have us mine it someplace else where there is no restrictions, just so they can get a good cheap price from China on their smartphones.",1487808000,,489,4.6976744186046515
8743852,3,B019479EQU,"Okay documentary but it's layout is quirky at best. They jump from being in the middle of the battle of Fort McHenry and the writing of what would become the Star Spangled Banner directly into Fur Trapping in the Pacific Northwest? No transition at all just cut directly to it. Almost seems like something was cut out. And to discuss the War between Mexico and the United States and not even mention ""The Alamo""?! HELLO!",1477958400,,420,4.613333333333333
8743853,4,B019479EQU,Nicely done documentary. Very complete. A bit slower in presentation than I am used to.,1472083200,2,87,4.866666666666666
