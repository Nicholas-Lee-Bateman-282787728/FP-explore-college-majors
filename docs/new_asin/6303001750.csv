7835291,5,6303001750,"I enjoyed the movie from begining to end. It made 100 minutes fly by without the thought of leaving my chair ever entering my head. Filled with intrigue and romance, not to mention a murder your constantly speculating on, your attention is entirely consumed by the plot and energy of the story and it's cast. Alfred,a ruggedly good looking guy, with the undertone of electricity and animal magnetism no woman could resist, was done dynamically by Assante. This movie starts off by showing you a taste of paradise, with all it's beautiful weather,unending supply of perfection and tons of money. The perfect life....or is it? Father's trying to force daughters to marry who they choose for them, not who they love. Daughters rebelling against parents. Then a new guy that doesn't quite fit in with the rest. Throw in a dash of organized crime,a turn against ones own country, and of course a murder and it's hard to see paradise anymore. I would strongly encourage you to watch this movie if your up for some rivetting entertainment.",989366400,,1032,4.836158192090395
