8221585,1,B0001US64G,"I pretty well figured this would be a documentary about Elvis considering he is in the title and on the cover. However most of the film is talking about Tom Jones. By the time you finish watching it you get the impression not only was Tom Jones a personal friend of Elvis, but if it wasn't for Tom, Elvis would never have taken up singing, the world would still be flat and he killed kirk robin. Stay away from this junk. The only saving grace of this is the fact there is some rare 8mm concert footage.",1088640000,23,503,4.195876288659794
