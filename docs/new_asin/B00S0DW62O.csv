6938173,5,B00S0DW62O,"I first came across this movie on TV and was moved deeply with the story and relationship between both prime characters. In response, I bought 2 copies of the movie from Amazon. One copy for myself and one for my daughter who is away from home and is a registered nurse, and very sensitive. In the few weeks I have had the movie, I have watched it 7 times, and have never been so moved by a movie before. The story, the music, the relationship between principle characters that develops (a young girl/nanny out in the world on her own, and a brilliant wealthy 12 year old boy who has taken charge of his seemingly isolated life in a wealthy family household. The movie is beautiful from beginning to end, but the ending will melt any heart that can recognize the beauty and tenderness of love. I am 74, and am thankful for the inspiration and joy this movie provided . A must for all who love life, and its moments, beauty and forms of expression.

6938178,2,B00S0DW62O,"Acting was excellent. Movie was slow but the characters were interesting so it became ok but the ending SUCKED. What a HUGE disappointment. Anybody with the ability to carry on a conversation with another human being could have written this movie. The actors were the only reason I stayed till the end. The writer could have written at least a dozen other much more likely endings for this movie but NO they wrote the stupidest ending they could come up with. Hated the movie. The ending ruined it. ANYONE and I do mean ANYONE could write an empty, leave em hanging, deeply sad ending. And why pick the one scenario where she absolutely would NOT have gone. Nothing about it made sense. I could go on and on but why.",1461456000,,716,4.515384615384615
6938179,4,B00S0DW62O,A very touching movie without being overly sentimental.  Two people of different backgrounds and ages form such a bond in the two months they spend together.  When it time to depart they realise how much they mean to each other.  They want to remain together but they know they can't.  Good performances from the two leads and a very satisfying movie overall.,1461456000,2,359,4.741935483870968

6938187,5,B00S0DW62O,"I can't wait to watch this movie after viewing the beautiful trailer over and over.

I watched it the same day it was delivered. And I watched it for the second time.
Often times I'm too tired to watch super fast action movie with violence.

This movie calms me down. Nice movie with great rewards and reviews.

(Watching it for the fifth time...2/21/2016 11:36pm. Great cast, great story )",1455494400,,390,4.6231884057971016

6938195,5,B00S0DW62O,"This wonderful film is currently running on Showtime, and I hope it finds a wider audience.  I had never heard of this film, but I was drawn in by the description and I am so glad I found it.

""Like Sunday, Like Rain"" is a coming of age story in the best sense of the word.  Reggie (Julian Shatkin), a twelve-year-old cello prodigy, is a massively gifted but lonely and isolated child whose parents are incredibly wealthy, cold, and distant.  His father (or step-father) is away in China and his mother is about to join her husband for the summer.  She hires Eleanor (Leighton Meester), a young woman from the opposite end of the economic and social scale, to be his nanny for six weeks.

Left to themselves, and after a slightly rocky start, the two begin a wonderful relationship that enriches both.  The film traces this relationship through the summer, introducing us to Eleanor's dysfunctional family and showing the growth of both main characters.  The ""coming of age"" part is, of course, primarily Reggie's, but Eleanor experiences her own maturation and resolves several issues from her own childhood.  Both actors are superb, taking material that could have been trite or sentimental and making it real and compelling.

The film's ending is not a fairy tale, but it is satisfying.  The title refers to a musical composition written by Reggie, and it forms the musical theme of the film.  I give this film my highest recommendation.  No violence, no sex, just the humanity of two people who come to love and respect one another.",1454112000,10,1536,4.7727272727272725
6938196,5,B00S0DW62O,"Nice movie, love the song in it and especially at the end.",1450569600,,58,3.9166666666666665
6938197,5,B00S0DW62O,"What an amazing, powerful movie! A classic example of a great indy film. Great acting, great music score. The film rests on the young shoulders of a green actor, and Julian's performance drives the film, as does Leighton's. It's one of those bittersweet, what could have been stories, It portrays two people who, in almost any other situation, would have been a perfect match, but because one is older, and the other isn't old enough, it wasn't meant to be that way. Nevertheless, the film shows us this bond of friendship that brings these two loanly people together, and through the script and acting, it is what drives the film, and makes it so good. This movie really shows how well a simple action can be worth more than words. As you'll see, there's a number of moments where Leighton and Julian's characters are going through some tough moments, and by simply being there for each other, without words, it does a good job of showing how much they mean to one another. Highly recommended to any who enjoys a good story, and music.",1449187200,6,1036,4.635869565217392

6938227,1,B00S0DW62O,"I'm gonna be honest. Only bought this because Billie Joe Armstrong was in it. Let's move on.

It's a classic boy meets girl, boy falls for girl, bit realizes he is only twelve years old, makes deals with every background character, and doesn't even go to camp. Metal lifestyle.

I'd image it'd be great if you were high as well. Don't know. Haven't tried it. If you try it, let me know. Actress was hot, everyone else probably looks more and more hot the more shots of liquor you have.",1439769600,2,485,4.377777777777778
6938228,5,B00S0DW62O,Was not too sure what the movie was going to be.  Discovered it was an intriguing story of sometimes complicated human relationships.  The young boy and young girl aided each other in their diverse and lonely lives.  A great movie.,1439164800,2,231,4.725

6938232,1,B00S0DW62O,"Why could't they gotten a child actor who really could play the cello... or could FAKE it better?  This boy was a good actor, but awful at faking playing cello, and lots of time was focused on him playing music.  His bows were never even in sync with the music and so out of whack, which made his total awkwardness on the instrument stand out even more.  They were playing this beautiful cello score and it was SO obvious he was more at Twinkle Twinkle level.  Why did they have to many scenes with him playing music since he was so bad at it?  I would have given this two stars except for the music scenes.  And why did they have to show the girl also faking it so badly at the end?  It really distracted from the plot for me and made everything unbelievable.  They could have just made shots of them playing from far away or just a few seconds long.  They maybe it would've worked.",1435276800,,883,4.208333333333333
6938233,5,B00S0DW62O,"A Masterpiece, that came a went so fast, most people haven't heard of it.  Some are calling it melancholy, but I think bittersweet is a better word. Above all, it's a story about a 12 year-old music prodigy being played by a c. 12 year-old acting prodigy. What's the significance of 12? It's that age where you're as mature as you're going to get before the onset of puberty. But what if your emotional maturity and profound awareness outstrip your physical growth? It's about resigning yourself to your solitude, until....

The result is a bittersweet gulf between two otherwise kindred souls. This isn't about dramatic friction, it's about something distinctive, enigmatic and fleeting. It's like playing a beautiful tune on a cello in an empty swimming pool with good acoustics. It's like Sunday, like rain. 10/10",1434585600,15,816,4.992647058823529
6938244,4,B00S0DW62O,"A protagonist/antagonist tale of a precocious young man whose intelligence and wealth makes it easy to manipulate all about him for his own convenience (albeit mostly positive); butts heads with his new nanny who, of course, is polar opposite and predictably they both compromise (well one more than the other) to make a predictable but enjoyable journey.

Casting and subsequent acting first rate. Dialogue appropriate to the roles was outstanding and naturalistically convincing.

Ending, however, was not convincing or challenging. Nanny was in a situation where the resources would have opened many windows of opportunity, so her decision did not jibe with her situational intelligence. A more creative ending would have been a subway (or equivalent) playing duet possibly as a foothold to greater things. Additionally, the young man could have learned to use his skills to help his classmates and even the teacher, and later, others as well. The nanny also had the resources to be selfless and be a positive changer.",1433980800,,1021,5.257668711656442

6938248,5,B00S0DW62O,"I watched this movie sunday night on Cable. It was the best I've seen in years!  The actors were superb.  I am not an emotional person, but this one brought me to tears at the visible heartbreak this young boy suffered!  I had hoped that it would end in future years, the boy grown up, searching for her and them falling in love despite the age differnce!",1430179200,7,355,4.268656716417911
6938249,5,B00S0DW62O,"Leighton Meester and Julian Shatkin are both amazing in this film. The relationship and understanding of each other they gradually develop is extraordinary. The way music brings them together in the end is a perfect ending. If you are a musician, the music in this movie will deeply touch your heart, as it did for me. I've also seen Leighton Meester two times in concert. I feel like whether she is acting or singing her own songs, she somehow always has this unspoken, gravitating power full of empathy and kindness that sets her apart. And this movie is no exception.

This movie is beautiful, watch it :)",1430006400,18,608,4.682242990654205
6938250,4,B00S0DW62O,"I am a big Green Day fan, and really wanted to see this movie. I pre-ordered it on Amazon. I thought I was ordering the streaming version on Prime Instant video, but instead it was a DVD. It took me 3 days to figure out how to view a DVD on my TV without having to buy a DVD player. I won't go into how the DVD cost $10 more than the streaming, and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with the DVD itself now that I've seen the movie. Instead, let me review the movie.

It was entertaining, and I enjoyed it. In a world where most of the movies being made these days have so much violence I can't watch them, this was a refreshing change. The characters were interesting, and the story had a lot of potential. Maybe I had too high expectations because I've been wanting to see this movie for months. There were some things about the movie I found confusing and unsatisfying. First, how can you have Billie Joe Armstrong in a movie and not have him sing or play any music at all? He was a so-so actor. Some of the things that happened in the movie didn't make sense. I was able to suspend belief to get past the idea that a mother would hire someone to move into her house while she is out of the country to take care of her child without checking references. And in order to enjoy the movie, I didn't question too closely several other things that happened along the way. But the ending did not make sense to me. Based on what I knew about the characters, what happened at the end would not have happened. So I walked away feeling puzzled. Since I bought the DVD, I'll probably watch it again to see if it makes sense this time. All in all I'm glad I bought it.",1429920000,,1662,4.113846153846154

6938252,2,B00S0DW62O,"Ok, so I see two people LOVED this movie.  However for myself, there just was nothing that drew me into the story, it was very very slow throughout. There just didn't seem to be much meat to the story or any climax.  I didn't walk away feeling emotional, or that it had accomplished anything.  I mean, the acting was great, but it just was extremely BLAH to me. And I really hate saying that, I love Leighton Meester, perhaps I'm just not smart enough to have grasped it or be too ADD to ""get it"" but I honestly felt there just was no clear motive to the movie.

Of course, I'm just a redneck from Alabama so that's just my lowly opinion, but I feel I wasted $6 to rent this dang movie.",1428537600,7,686,4.135338345864661
