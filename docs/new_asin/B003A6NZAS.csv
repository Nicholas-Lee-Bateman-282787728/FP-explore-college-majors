8392835,5,B003A6NZAS,"I have every Care Bears dvd currently available and this ranks as one of the best. My two favorite episodes are on this DVD.These
being True Hearts Big Trip( I always wanted her to get Oopsie as a mate)and Battle of the Band. My only regret is that the
episodes A Baby Bottle and Where's Lovalot are still not available. Still, this is an excellant collection of Care Bear episodes.",1278892800,3,382,4.4714285714285715
