8211631,5,B000TZN7L0,"Is Susana a femme fatale? The personification of evil? A mentally ill woman who was raped as a child? Is this a morality play or a subtle play with conventional morality? If Susana brings out the worst in people (and they all get plenty crazy) what or who brought out the worst in her? There is good and bad, poor and rich, proper and improper. Not without humor, not without stereotypes, this little gem of a film keeps you guessing throughout. The cinematography is professional and the characters are played to the hilt by an excellent cast. Bunuel again proves his big heart and cinematic genius.

Interestingly similar to Pasolini's Teorema. The CINEMATECA print is very watchable.",1514505600,,686,4.863247863247863

8211633,4,B000TZN7L0,"Like ""A woman without love"" part of the Mexican period. Great melodrama, not the best and either wilder or more mature Buuel from Perro Andaluz or Viridiana, but a great movie to follow his trajectory.",1460505600,,201,4.771428571428571

8211636,5,B000TZN7L0,"Haba visto esta pelcula aos atrs y despus de todos estos aos, aun se siente actual. Por supuesto, el contexto, un idlico pueblo rural, est muy lejos de pertenecer al actual Mxico, si es que alguna vez tal cosa existi.

Sin embargo, las pasiones humanas, el deseo sexual, los celos, la ira, el amor maternal, en resumen, lo que nos hace humanos, est muy bien representado en esta pelcula. Rosita Quintana, como Susana, estupenda. Uno siento un poco de nostalgia al mirar estas pelculas, cuando por la censura, era imposible mostrar ms all de ciertas partes del cuerpo. Todo est sugerido, apenas un corpio o una pierna se ven, pero eso es ms que suficiente. Susana transpira sexualidad y es entendible que haga perder la cabeza a los hombres.

La presencia de Susana transforma a  los hombres en juguetes del deseo. Me parece como una nueva versin del cuento del jardn del Edn, solo que con un final diferente. El bien triunfa, s, pero el precio es alto. Al final todos los personajes se miran con desconfianza, me parece. Y no creo que la vida vaya a ser como antes.

Tal vez una de las menos conocidas obras de Luis Buuel, pero altamente recomendable.",1269302400,4,1151,4.627450980392157
8211637,4,B000TZN7L0,"Don Luis Bunuel is the only film director who never disappointed me.  I've seen 20 his films from different periods of his life, and I like a lot all of them. Each is interesting and memorable in its own way. Made in 1951 during Bunuel's Mexican period, ""Susana"" aka ""Carne Y Demonio"" or ""The Devil and the Flesh"" is not an exception.  The story of Susana (Rosita Quintana) , a sexy  fame fatal,  a walking temptation,  is known as a ""lesser"" Bunuel and the film critics and the viewers often seem to apologize for liking the film, motivating that it lacks Bunuel's trademark surrealism.  Bunuel was good in everything he ever done, even in ""perfectly routine"" pictures, and ""Susana"" has his touches all over. First of all, the music fits the story very well with its sensual creepiness. Bunuel's cinematography is masterful. The opening scene in the solitary reformatory cell is appropriately dark, devastating but in general - ironic when Susana is able to escape after praying to God and asking Him for help. One of the night scenes shot from three angles when three men watch the object of their desire thru the window is a work of art. The eponymous heroine of the film is a bad girl, a sensuous troublemaker who ruins the established order of one family's life simply by being there but pay attention how much in love is the camera with her. She is a walking temptation which is hard to resist. Susana has no regrets, no scruples regarding her goals and the ways to reach them but the truth of the matter is that she is young, beautiful, and irresistibly desirable for every male she simply passes by. The final sequence of the movie is a pure Bunuel and it is sarcastic in his best traditions. The storm has passed, everyone seems happy in Don Guadalupe's household after Susana was  returned to prison by force, even Don Guadalupe's favorite Arabian mare recovered after serious illness .  Everyone praises the Lord and ready to forget that Susana ever happened in their lives and to move on.  Well,  something tells me it would not be very easy to shake the memories of Susana for everyone who knew her.",1218672000,11,2112,4.638069705093834
8211638,4,B000TZN7L0,"A woman is dragged into a reform school for girls.  We are not told what she has done, but apparently, it's bad enough to be a rough, hardcore solitary prison cell.  She prays for a miracle and breaks free.  She comes upon a Mexican hacienda occupied by a super nice and decent family, complete with ranch help.  Using her beauty, she proceeds to wreak havoc by separately seducing each of the male members on the ranch, then pitting them against each other.  What are the other women - the estate owner's wife and head maid - to do?  The movie slowly builds to a maddening crescendo, leaving us to wonder who will get the boot from the estate and who will be the last to remain standing; will decency triumph over lust?

Luis Bunuel, director of Un Chien Andalou and L'Age D'Or - two surrealistic masterpieces that involved Salvador Dali in the production and were seen as the birth of experimental cinema - made this film in 1951.  It is uncharacteristically ""normal"" on the surface.  In fact, if you didn't look at the credits, it could have just as well been a soap opera.  It has an age old story and themes most people can relate to: Does beauty blind people? Will youth trump experience?  Will might make right?  Can book smarts outsmart feminine wiles?

Once you discover Luis Bunuel was behind the camera, then you start recognizing all the surrealist themes.  There's the all-out assault on establishment.  Then there's the individual dream state each man enters under the spell of Susana; her beauty is really a vehicle for Bunuel to question the integrity of sight, and how easily we can be deceived. There's also that earthy fascination with dirt on a human body, and of course: that wonderful recurring jingling sound in Bunuel films, now embodied in the spurs.

All in all, an entertaining film.  It shows that our man behind the curtains could have effortlessly gone mainstream had he chose to.  Just don't expect razor blades, exploding eyeballs, or body doubles in parallel universes.",1213401600,8,2002,4.736994219653179
