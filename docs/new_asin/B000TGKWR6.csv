Wow! goes through my mind especially when I don't know what I'll be purchasing or what's on the DVDs.  Did not see listing of episodes or titles.  What exactly does ""Dragnet: 20 Big Episodes"" include.  Needs a list so I can make an educated judgment.  Unlikely and unwise to spend so much on unknown merchandise in my opinion.",1370736000,,448,4.55
