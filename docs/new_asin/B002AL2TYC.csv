3885063,5,B002AL2TYC,"I loved this movie. I have already watched it 3 times since September. I start Christmas a little early :)
Romantic comedy, love Henry Winkler, and great little romantic tension in the story line.",1256947200,3,196,4.794117647058823
3885064,5,B002AL2TYC,"This is a terrific Christmas movie.  And I agree, it doesn't have to just be watched during Christmas - it is a great feel good movie for anytime.  Even my husband likes to watch it!",1256342400,5,182,4.171428571428572
3885065,2,B002AL2TYC,"I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it on tv. I was a little uncomfortable with the two unnecessary towel scenes but they were tastefully enough done that I could overlook it. I was thrilled to see it was on dvd and bought a copy immediately. Sometimes it's cool when they add deleted scenes back into the movie. Sometimes not. This DVD release had one of each instance. There's an added car scene with Jen and Morgan after they pick up the bike that was kind of sweet. The other added scene was of a definitely naked Jen getting into the shower. You don't see anything except her bare back (extending very low down her back) but unlike the towel scene where one could assume for filming she was actually wearing a strapless bathing suit, the shower scene is quite a bit more revealing and really completely unnecessary. I know there are many who will think I'm being silly but had I known about the shower scene I would not have purchased this dvd. This review is more to warn people like me. The rest of you, I'm sure will enjoy the movie and be glad it was released so quickly onto DVD.",1255996800,215,1092,4.357843137254902
3885066,5,B002AL2TYC,"The movie starts with introducing us to a lovable cop who enjoys beating up burglars. Then it takes you to meet Jennifer, a single mom, and her darling son, as he asks (paraphrased) ""How can Santa be real? It isn't possible! But I do want to believe!"" Jennifer does her best to answer her sons questions, but struggles to find the right answers, as she herself does not like Christmas.

Then you meet Morgan, a nomad. He usually spends his time sleeping on the floors at the airport until by chance, he meets the cop. The two become fast friends and pull a con on one of the workers at the airport. The worker upgrades them to first class on the plane. When the friends arrive in Chicago, Morgan heads off too board his next plane only to find that the airport in Denver, where he is headed, is closed down because of a snowstorm. So, reluctant to let a stranger into her home, Jennifer finally invites Morgan to stay with her, her uncle (the cop), and her son.

Filled with laughter, awkward moments, apologies, and break ups, this movie is a wonderful tale that teaches you to love the little things in life and to not let all the preperation for Christmas keep you from enjoying the holiday's season. The movie was a real tear jerker nearing the end, so have your tissue box ready!",1255737600,114,1284,4.436440677966102

3885139,5,B002AL2TYC,This movie is G-rated and can be watched with anyone at anytime. There is a Christmas theme and Christmas music but it is slightly quirkier and funnier and edgier than the typical Hallmark rom-com. Henry Winkler stars and provides humor. There are instances of cartoon-like violence but nothing offensive or gory. I ordered two as Christmas gifts for friends who had family coming for the holidays.,1515542400,,398,5.045454545454546

3885158,5,B002AL2TYC,"Cute story.  Henry Winkler's character is really funny and sometimes poignant. The plot was predictable and could have been fleshed out more, but this movie supplied what you want at Christmas - some warm fuzzies and good cheer.",1513641600,,228,5.0

3885174,5,B002AL2TYC,"And yet another holiday movie featuring a character who is an avowed holiday hater (Brooke Burns as Jennifer Cullen).  She has a young son she is raising alone.  She fakes the holiday niceties for his sake while waiting for her effusive Uncle Ralph (Henry Winkler) to show up and take over the duty of holiday cheer.  She has a fractious relationship with her neighbor who expects all the houses on her block to comply with her holiday standardswhere are your lights, we need to see your lights, white lights, why aren't your lights on yet!?  Jennifer is a list maker.  Her life isn't lived until she first checks her list.  Into her almost well-order life comes freewheeling Morgan Derby (Warren Christie), an unwanted house guest and a jack of all trades who lives life without a plan.  Jennifer is also unromantically entangled with an uptight snob who expects they will get married, its an unstated understanding.  Complications ensue, a garbage can is put to good use, and a real tree is procured.  Its all rather jolly thanks entirely to Henry Winkler as a suspicious ex-cop who knows how to fudge weather reports.",1512691200,,1120,4.791666666666667
3885175,5,B002AL2TYC,Best Hallmark Christmas movie EVER!,1512518400,,35,6.2

3885183,3,B002AL2TYC,"Did anyone notice Morgan has no job, no home, no salary, has never had a job, home, or salary. He assaults a toy shop owner with a trash can.  The poor toy shop owner is left unconscious in the snow and Jennifer thinks this is awesome.  Of course this is Hallmark so Jennifer dumps her somewhat icky boyfriend for a homeless vagabond with no business acumen.  Other than that there are a lot of cute scenes and Henry Winkler shines.""",1510185600,,433,4.3875
3885194,3,B002AL2TYC,"This movie, when shown on the Hallmark Channel, is one of my favorites. I am now embarrassed to say that I bought several copies to give as gifts Christmas 2016.

3885214,5,B002AL2TYC,"I've seen this one before, and I was delighted to find it again. It's terrific! The two romantic leads are engaging and have a good amount of chemistry, but Henry Winkler steals the show. He's very funny. My only complaint is one scene involving a fight in an alley. It seems kind of out of character for Morgan, especially the way it's resolved. I expected him to be more clever.

3885367,2,B002AL2TYC,"I just don't understand the 5 star ratings on this film. It's going straight to my donation bin. It starts with Jennifer Callen taking on the persona that men did in the workplace in the 1970s -- ordering her assistant (a black woman) to take care of her personal business -- and hurry up about it while I sit here looking pretty. ARGH. Then you have to wonder how a 6 foot tall woman has an uncle who is five foot something, a height difference that's distracting throughout the film. It's the same old over used plot that Hallmark does repeatedly-- do I choose the rich guy or this nicer poor guy that's not so materialistic. Henry Winkler is the only good thing about this film, but even he could not save it.",1482883200,,712,4.360902255639098

3885397,5,B002AL2TYC,"A wonderful Christmas movie that I am pleased to add to my collection. It is wholesome and ispirational. I find the content of this movie acceptable for my taste. I belong to Netflix streaming as well as Amazon plus streaming. I am very very selective of what I will watch. I would say that 99% of movies are not to my taste, violence, horror, military, political, radical religious beliefs, drugs, sexual content, making love, vulgarity, superficial sitcom chatter, adrenaline rush, racist, hatred, obscenity, government conspiracy, etc, etc. Some people were complaining about a bathroom scene where a nude back was exposed, That did not bother me. If people are offended by that, they should sell their television and computers, or get use to watching movies of the 30's 40's and 50's. I have a large video library of what I consider wholesome movies, I accept it that there might be a little stuff that I can fast forward, if I choose to. I do not at all watch any television channels because of all the crap. There is something for everybody, they have the right to watch what they want or complain about it",1482192000,,1112,4.737113402061856

I cannot figure out how this one has such high ratings. The obnoxious boyfriend was too over-the-top, the mysterious stranger was left a complete mystery even as the movie ended. We know absolutely nothing about the guy and as a result, I just wasn't crazy about the character. I couldn't relate to him or like him. He was just quiet and mysterious with nothing to make you fall for him. And then there was a scene or two that would have made me embarrassed to watch this movie with my kids (like when she's showering and it shows her naked back).

The reason I rated the movie down is because when it was copied to a DVD for sale, they did a really poor job in a couple of places pulling the movie together and getting rid of the cuts for commercials.  I love this movie but toward the end it is very disruptive to have 2-3 blank places -- they just did a really poor job of copying to DVD and BluRay.  I have received 2-3 of the Hallmark movies that have this disruption but this movie was the worse.  I will keep them as they did not cost very much.  I suppose I should ask Amazon to replace.",1470355200,6,666,4.092307692307692

Add in Henry Winkler, a cute little kid, and a pretty girl, and you've got an enjoyable evening's entertainment.",1446076800,,375,4.5

With many one-liners that keep you laughing his character will endear the audience to his character and that of the rest of the cast. An instant holiday favorite, now. Each Thanksgiving we give a new Christmas DVD to our 7 daughters and their families. It's given at Thanksgiving to kick start the Christmas season. Our daughters, sons-in-law and grandchildren have come to love this annual Thanksgiving tradition we have. This DVD was given last year, 2014.",1443571200,6,516,5.08235294117647

The very best of all the little Christmas Romances I've seen on here and I have a rather large collection of them!
* NOTE** If you have children who believe in it are questioning Santa, Do Not Watch this with them! The story line reveals how the most wished for Christmas Gift was provided... (Purchased at a store). It's a wonderful part of the movie but it's a spoiler for those little ones.....

Not too Christmas like as I was expecting.  But it's not a terrible movie either.  Just don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.

It will be a hard Christmas without her, and without our Mother who died a month after Diane.  But, I will bring their cherished memories to life every time I watch this movie.

How weasely is the said girl's boyfriend going to get to move the hunk-a-Christmas-love out of the house?  Who will cook the turkey?  What's with the one red light bulb?

3885799,5,B002AL2TYC,"I wavered over giving this one 4 or 5 stars, but I think it's good enough -- I certainly enjoyed watching it the past two years.  Henry Winkler is perfect for his role here, a just-retired city policeman who lost his wife not all that long ago.  He's headed to his niece's home for the holiday season when he meets a young man whom he believes is some kind of panhandler, but who turns out to be a really nice and helpful guy.  He's been traveling the world for years now and is thinking about putting down roots.

  His niece is not so happy that her home is going to play host to a total stranger -- but uncle Ralph (Winkler) tells her he can tell good from bad buys.  He loves his niece but thinks she needs a change, not just for herself but for her son.  And the first change should be to get rid of her boyfriend, who might propose marriage any day now.

  It is a romantic comedy, and a good one.  The characters are endearing, and niece and guest are slowly, slowly! starting to like each other.  There is a lot to like about both of them.  They are so much ""unalike"" but sometimes opposites not only attract, but they complement each other, give to the relationship just what the other one needs.  Besides, he really likes her son -- what other stranger would go to such lengths to try to prove that there is a Santa?

  A nice, family-friendly Christmas movie.  Another Hallmark movie that just might please you too.",1420675200,5,1426,4.293233082706767

Because she is having her fiancees parents coming tp Christmas dinner she is not anxious to have a strange man at her house no matter how helpful he is turning out to be.

3885870,1,B002AL2TYC,"I'll watch anything with Henry ""Fonzie"" Winkler in it because he's a great actor. But the movie is a flop overall. It's the all-too predictable ""Hallmark Channel formula"" with nothing interesting going on except the kind of wonderful Christmas scenery that everyone loves (but rarely gets to experience). In reality, how many people have had a ""Hallmark Christmas Miracle"" come through at the last minute and save their Christmas?

The lead actress is a dog-faced bore that the audience cares nothing about, and the male lead actor isn't believable at all - in fact, it's hard to imagine that this guy even likes women! Not only that, but no one with half a brain is going to invite a vagabond like this guy to spend Christmas with their family...no one! And in reality, this woman isn't going to end up with a guy on a chef's salary anyway.

Guys, if your wife/girlfriend wants you to cuddle up and watch this with you (the way I was ambushed), you'd be well advised to have a good bottle of liquor at your side - you're going to need it!

3886001,1,B002AL2TYC,"My husband and I rented this movie after reading the wonderful reviews here. Because of the reviews I figured it was one of those movies that was really great that a lot of people had not had the opportunity to hear about or see. We were so enthusiastic we paid $9.99 to watch it.
Henry Winkler (the one bright spot in the entire film) meets a cute vagrant in the airport at Christmas with no place to go and takes him home to his niece's house (I think it is his niece) whom Henry is visiting for the holidays. This niece lady is a single mom and she has a little boy. She is blond and skinny and wears makeup and has her hair curled at all times of the day and night. She also has a not very caring rich boyfriend who is a jeweler. After I about two days go by the question becomes who will she pick? The homeless vagrant with the stubble beard or the rich, handsome somewhat aloof guy? Of course she ends of running to the airport at the end to stop the homeless man with no prospects from leaving her on Christmas Day. Why would anyone do that? No one but Henry Winkler can really act so you don't even care. This was not fun to watch even as just a bad movie you can laugh at. It was awful.",1388620800,3,1195,4.046413502109704

Walmart and Hastings were sold out and I thought that I wasn't going to be able to get this for her. I decided to check Amazon.com and I was very lucky. I got a double feature dvd brand new in a sealed package, with the movie she wanted and also Moonlight & Mistletoe another one she liked for a little more than I would have paid for one dvd. The shipping date told me that I wouldn't receive this dvd before Christmas though, which made me a little sad. It was my fault for waiting a week before Christmas to buy it. I was very excited when I did receive it before Christmas. The look on my daughter's face when she opened it was priceless! When we opened the dvd there was a fine crack where the circle opening on dvd was, but we played the dvd and it played perfectly. Very happy with the speedy service.

- Uncle Ralph: ""Wow. He sounds like a bookcase.""

Around Christmastime, TCM and Hallmark are the two cable channels I tune in for my fix of holiday flicks. There's always one or three that air that I haven't seen before. Case in point, Hallmark's terrific 2008 offering, THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR. It's so watchable I marvel that it's skipped my radar for the past four years. It'll now be on steady rotation in my household.

Lovely Jennifer Cullen (Brooke Burns) has been cautious all her life, and I guess she's done okay with that. Today, she's a successful (if harried) corporate executive in Chicago. She's the single mom of an adorable little boy, and yet she's disenchanted with Christmas. She tends to make lists she never crosses off. This holiday season she's brooding over cooking the perfect Christmas day turkey meal for her boyfriend's parents and also over gratifying her kid's one lone Christmas wish: the very elusive ""Rocket Wheel"" bike. For Jennifer Cullen, it's the most stressful time of the year. And then her retired Brooklyn ex-cop uncle (Henry Winkler) arrives with a surprise guest: some stranger he'd befriended at the airport.

Jennifer doesn't know what to make of Morgan Derby (Warren Christie). She can't fathom the way he lives his life. Morgan is a carefree globe trotter, a sort of Renaissance man with all the jobs he'd taken on during his travels (he's a chef, he's worked on a turtle farm, etc.). Except that now Morgan's decided it's time to put down roots. He's thinking of opening a restaurant in Denver with an old flame. Sharing a plane ride from New York to Chicago with Jennifer's uncle, Morgan learns that his continuing flight to Denver is canceled due to heavy Colorado snow. Jennifer's Uncle Ralph, rough-around-the-edges but really a softie, urges her to let him stay for the night. She welcomes Morgan... warily, resentfully. Uncle Ralph merrily cautions Morgan that Jennifer is savvy when it comes to business but ""when it comes to life, she's dumber than a bag of barber hair.""

THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR is a clunky title, but don't let that dissuade you. This was a wonderful surprise for me. Yes, it's predictable as are most holiday films. But the execution and the warm performances eclipse that predictability. Burns and Christie are both irresistible and create a marvelous spark in their moments together; you immediately root for them to get together. The film satisfies the unrepentant romantic. Morgan rapidly impacts the Cullen household and right away gets under Jennifer's nerves. I love Morgan's Christmas spirit and how he establishes new traditions for the Cullens (my favorite touch is his absolutely made-up ""old Portuguese tradition based on the legend of the one red candle""). And maybe the most fun moment surfaces when Jennifer and Morgan try to procure the rare Rocket Wheel bike for Jennifer's kid. That alley scrap unfolds in awesome ways.

And, of course, what's a romantic movie without a mad dash to the airport at the end? See? Predictable, but oh so much fun! This one's a keeper.",1356307200,2,3217,4.90625

It's got everything you're looking for in a holiday movie, light-hearted romance, humor, fun, and let's face it, Henry Winkler just shines in this story.  As a single mom myself, I could totally relate to Jennifer's story, and found myself chuckling at some of her one-liners to her nosy neighbor.

Henry Winkler is perfect as a relative you'd like to have, The romantic male lead is exactly the guy you'd want as a friend, lover, dad, etc.  The situation, settings and people are all good light holiday fun.  The plot is an appealing tweak on one that's already worked for plenty of other Christmas movies.  Nothing wrong with following a formula if it's well done and the product is satisfying.  This is one I've seen enough times to want to buy it.  Highly recommended.

As for previous comments about the two ""towel"" scenes, in which the leads encounter each other before or after a shower, Come, on!  The guy is SO covered with towels that you see no more than you would if he unbuttoned the top 3 buttons of his shirt.  The girl's back is no more than you would see if she wore a strapless dress or bathing suit.  Much ado about nothing.

The reason I am returning the disc is: this is a relatively new movie, shot for TV with the new standard of 16x9 or 1.78 aspect ratio of today's flatscreen TVs.  That is the way it is broadcast, so that's what I expect from the DVD.  Two listings for this title, one indicates old square TV at 1.33, the one I ordered said 1.78 in Amazon's product details.  The box it comes in says the movie is 14x9 letterbox.  What it really is is Windowboxed, meaning there is a thick black border on all four sides of the picture, making the picture smaller than it is when broadcast on TV.  If a movie looks bigger and better on television, why should I buy the DVD?",1350604800,,1540,4.295138888888889

We ended up watching this movie 3 times over the course of a week with various family members and laughed each time. Henry Winkler plays a truly lovable character who adds in some nice commentaries during the movie (shiny shoes).  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the under the breath comments by the mom to various annoying folks around her (hope you choke on your eggnog).  There are no surprises in the movie and you know the happy ending that's coming but you will still enjoy the time getting there.

3886335,5,B002AL2TYC,"I've watched this film at least 20 times and loved it each time.  The script is smart, the acting and directing is terrific, and the result is a very fun Christmas film that has good messages year round.  I agree that young children who are expecting Santa would not benefit from seeing this film if by watching the young boy in the film wrestle with the existence of Santa would spoil the fantasy of Christmas.  For everyone else, this film is highly recommended.

The actors deliver their characters so well.  Jennifer is very convincing as a high energy, single, career Mom.  Uncle Ralph is the guy we all wish we were related to so he could be a part of our own family.  Morgan Derby is the perfect blend of relaxed optimism and helpful house guest.  He does more to help Jennifer in 3 days than her fiance has probably done in 3 years.  The young Bryan delivers his lines and facial expressions like an old pro and I would say the same for Rita, Richard, Richard's parents, and all the other characters at home, around town, in the office, and at the airport.

This film is clean; there's no violence, no foul language, nothing offensive at all.  Thank you Hallmark for delivering such a welcome adventure.",1325548800,4,1211,4.534562211981567

3886339,5,B002AL2TYC,"""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year,"" which premiered on Hallmark Channel in 2008, casts Henry Winkler as a visiting uncle to his niece, to whom he relates like a daughter. (He is a retired cop.) Brooke Burns is that niece, a too-serious corporate analyst and single mother. She is in a relationship with the wrong kind of man. The uncle comes to the rescue as fate, when he meets at an airport a free spirit, one who can really cook a turkey. (The niece is lost in the kitchen.) Warren Christie is that free spirit. And we get to watch the action unfold with charming and predictable (but not at all badly predictable) ease. And that ease comes from a game and intelligent cast.

Some may figure ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" falls into the category of ""chick flick."" But that's only because of this current period, and a cultural reference to material that was more frequently produced and very popular on the big screen in decades past. ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" is really a romantic comedy. And Hallmark Channel (and its spinoff, Hallmark Movie Channel) has been airing it regularly during the November/December 2011 holiday period. This has been a holiday period full of valentines for those in the mood for engaging, romantic entertainment.

""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" delivers.

It's a worthy purchase.

(Note: I have given ""The Most Wonderful Time of the Year"" the top rating because I have viewed and absorbed plenty of other Hallmark Channel/Hallmark Movie Channel titles that aired during the holiday-themed, November/December 2011 period. Quality wise, it is one of the best, over the last five years, from this programmer.)",1325116800,2,1668,4.842105263157895

I'm in agreement with at least one reviewer that the handsome dude coming out of the shower-room in only a towel to find the mom there holding towels, was not necessary. Hollywood and movie producers in general just don't seem to get it that romance can be portrayed without sexual innuendo. Case in point: Anna and the King.

3886349,3,B002AL2TYC,"Single Mom and workaholic Jennifer Cullen doesn't have time for Christmas. In fact, hers is the only house not decorated with white lights per the unspoken community block agreement (which her neighbor is more than happy to remind her).

Even Jennifer's son, Brian, isn't sure if he believes in Santa (but he obviously wants to).

Jennifer is engaged to an uptight, somber jeweler who throws money at everything and everyone, and she's clearly not very happy (even though he's a ""solid"" match).

Enter Uncle Ralph, a retired policeman played by Henry Winkler (The Fonz!), who flies in for Christmas to stay with Jennifer and Brian. Winker is endearing (naturally) and happens to bring along a stranded (and handsome) fellow passenger.

The rest of The Most Wonderful Time of the Year is rather predictable, but it's one of the more better-acted and better-written holiday romances. I admit to shedding a few tears at the ""down-to-the-wire"", triumphantly joyous ending. It's a feel good movie, for sure, and my whole family loved it (even my 13-year old).

However, there's a two inexplicable sour notes in this movie: when Jennifer's syrupy neighbor encourages her to get her lights up for the umpteenth time, Jennifer says under her breath that she's a ""light Nazi"". I bristle at anyone trivializing the Holocaust, especially in such an inane setting.

But later in the movie, Henry Winkler's character says to Jennifer's fianc's parents (who are apparently Jewish): ""Oh, I knew a few Jews. They were all thieves"". Considering Winker IS Jewish, I can't believe he agreed to speak those anti-Semitic lines!

If you're not bothered by these two examples, then you'll probably love The Most Wonderful Time of the Year. It's a really good movie that, for me, was tainted by the mention of Nazis and anti-Jewish sentiments.

It's funny and engaging and extremely warm.  I think the film's strength lies with Henry Winkler, a terrific actor who unfortunately will forever be associated with the Fonz.  Winkler plays the female lead's retired cop uncle who recently lost his wife yet still maintains an upbeat attitude.  Winkler decides to do a little yuletide matchmaking with his niece and he comes of as a likable colorful sort.

After some obvious twists and turns all is happy in the end thanks to several pushes in the right direction from Uncle (Henry).

I found the acting by all fine as opposed to another opinion given.  Perhaps the other opinion given couldn't understand the consternation of a woman looking forward to engagement and meeting her future ""in laws"" only to be exasperated by her Uncle bringing home a complete stranger.  I felt the heroin's acting fit the pressure exacted on her given the situation not of her own choosing.

Henry Winkler is beyond adorable as a meddeling uncle, bringing about the unlikely romance that was certainly written in the stars.

I highly recommend adding this DVD to your collection. The Most Wonderful Time of the Year is great to watch any time you need a romantic lift, and a lot of laughs!",1286755200,3,540,4.673684210526316

3886393,3,B002AL2TYC,"I'm usually a sucker for these Christmas holiday films, so when I read the general plot of this movie, I looked forward to seeing it.  In particular, I've always like Henry Winkler, though he hasn't always been able to get the good roles that will make us want him to get lifetime achievement awards.  I almost was waiting for him to do something wacky in this movie, but fortunately, he played his matchmaker/uncle role very well.

The Christmas season and Christmas magic will usually explain some of the way people fall in love in these movies, but I'd still like for there to be some chemistry or signs of interest.  I liked how the male protagonist gives clues that he likes the lady, but I really didn't see how she in turn, was even considering him.  So you can probably guess that they'll end up together by the end of the movie, but for me, it wasn't as magical and sentimental a journey as other movies since I felt like it was a bit contrived just to try to give this ""happy"" ending.  Even the guy she was dating wasn't exactly a horrible person (throughout the movie) to make us want to cheer about her getting together with the male lead.

I still like it enough to watch every year as I go through my holiday collection, but it didn't really fill me with any sense of Christmas wonder that some other movies have done.

Another disappointing part has to do with the DVD product itself.  It doesn't have English (or any language) subtitle or even close-captioning.",1273449600,6,1477,4.50187265917603

My eight-year-old son enjoyed it as well, and didn't pick up on the child not believing in Santa, and in fact, though it hilarious when Morgan fell off the roof, and his ""fight"" scene with the toy store owner.

Henry Winkler was the glue that held it togeter while the bickering couple were actually getting in tune with each other.

I think Warren Christie does humor better than Cary Grant.  I'm wondering where he's been and why he hasn't been ""more"" discovered. (I missed the ""October Road"" series.)

3886423,5,B002AL2TYC,"I TIVOed this movie last year (December 24, 2008 to be exact) and didn't delete it until I purchased this DVD. Although the story is somewhat predictable, the scenes are played out with tenderness, sensitivity and yes, humor. Henry Winkler is wonderful as Uncle Ralph, the devoted father-figure to single mother, Jennifer Cullen (Brooke Burns). When Ralph, on his way to spend Christmas with his niece, runs into free-spirit wanderer, Morgan Derby (Warren Christie)at the airport, the two develop an immediate friendship. When Morgan's flight to Denver is cancelled, well, let's just say that's where the fun begins as Uncle Ralph talks Jennifer into letting Morgan stay at her house until another flight can be scheduled. The film's description decribes Jennifer as a ""Scroogette"", but I feel that is a bit of an overstatement. She is happy enough and tries hard to get in the spirit of the season...but she is overwhelmed with the ""shoulds"" and ""musts"" that are certain to sabotage her holiday cheer. To make matters worse she is dating a man whose pretentious and irritating demeanor are obvious to Uncle Ralph, who, by the way, makes no bones in expressing how he feels. The film unfolds with Morgan alternately helping and ticking off Jennifer, who feels his presence in the house ""looks bad"". Jennifer's son, Brian, forges a bond with Morgan and is upset when Christmas morning finds Morgan gone (I won't spoil your viewing experience by revealing the details). The film has a happy ending, though. Let's just say that Uncle Ralph has the satisfaction of knowing that he has played his cards quite well indeed! This is a lovely film...romance, sweetness and humor all rolled up into one little holiday package. I recommend this film to anyone who loves Christmas and the miracles it brings.",1258416000,29,1796,4.99

Henry Winkler is fabulous in the role as the retired cop...and man oh man, Warren Christie is a great actor and beautiful to boot.  Only one thing to watch for-(possible spoiler here) and that is...there is alot of talk of the reality of Santa and the little boy fearful of him not being ""real"" due to school kids.  A large part of the plot, for those of us with young kids, makes it pretty clear that someone other than Santa is coming on Christmas Eve.  The movie eventually leads the adults to fabricate Santa arriving to reassure the boy of Santa's existence and even the gift he asked Santa for is clearly hunted for and purchased by the Mom (during part of hysterical mishaps in the film) and left from Santa Christmas morning. I love the film 100%, I love the message behind it and the acting is fantastic- but I am sad that I cannot watch it with my young kids. In five minutes, I was already turning it off and trying to explain a scene away...but that doesn't stop me from watching it after they go to bed!!",1258243200,86,1083,4.294117647058823

3886429,4,B002AL2TYC,"Henry Winkler's portrayal of ""Uncle Ralph"" saves this from being just another one of many Christmas movies about a single parent struggling through the holiday and dating someone who isn't right for them. I won't summarize the story, as it has been well covered. I just want to give parents a ""heads up"" about a few things. There is plenty of humor in this movie, but there are some things portrayed as humorous or acceptable to which some parents might object.

*Possible Spoilers*
An earlier review mentioned the shower scene with the bare back and beyond (which was totally unnecessary). Some may also not appreciate that at different times Morgan and Jennifer each catch the other one wrapped in a towel after they have just stepped out of the shower (to me this was too contrived--once was funny, twice was obvious). There is some profaning of the Lord's name and there is deceit used by several characters and there are negative consequences only once. Morgan lies to an airport employee and threatens a lawsuit so that he and Uncle Ralph can avoid a long line and get bumped to first class. Uncle Ralph videotapes a weather forecast and plays it later to convince his niece that the airport in Denver is still snowed in, when it really isn't. Morgan sets off a locked toy store alarm and waits in the shadows when the police arrive. He surfaces after the owner arrives and police leave so that they can get a toy that was paid for but not picked up on time. (Though not involving deceit, I thought the scene where Morgan lays into the toy store owner with a metal garbage can was  presented as something justifiable and without consequences. Okay, so the store owner was asking for it, but the mother in me bristled. That isn't the kind of behavior I would have wanted my kids to see presented as acceptable--solving our problems with violence.) Jennifer's fiancee hides the letter Morgan leaves for her when he slips out and it isn't discovered until the next day by her son (this is the only time it seems the deceit doesn't achieve the desired result). And finally, Uncle Ralph removes Morgan's passport from his bag so that at the airport he has no form of government issued ID and they won't let him through security.

The acting was fine, and the story was entertaining, though predictable. With the issues mentioned above there may be some who would not consider it right for their family.",1257724800,4,2403,4.67612293144208
