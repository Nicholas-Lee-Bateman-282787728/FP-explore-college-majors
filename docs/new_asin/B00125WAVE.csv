8244069,5,B00125WAVE,"Got this DVD for my 2 yr. old and 3 yr. old sons.  They love it.  Lots of bright colors, and great stories about friendship - picking a ""best friend"" (you don't have to pick just one), always including others, and being friendly to those who don't speak the same language.  I think it would be great for young schoolage kids (pre-K or K). Great DVD.",1221523200,2,349,4.257575757575758
