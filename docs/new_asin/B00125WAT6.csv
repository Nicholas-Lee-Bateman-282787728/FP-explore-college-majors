3076804,4,B00125WAT6,"This two DVD set includes nine regular episodes plus a ""'Wear' are they now?"" special episode.  Nearly all the women also have careers outside the home, so episodes include advice for professional clothing, not just mom-wear.  The episodes are as follows:
*Shifra, a 5 foot, 4 inch redhead
*Cynthia, a 5 foot, 28-year-old Latina
*Lisa, a petite and fit lawyer (who can fit into her 10-year-old's clothes!)
*Jennifer, a blond, 25-year-old brand new mom
*Maria, a 5 foot tall, Italian-American (Yowza! this is one of the best hair and make-up makeovers I've seen)
*Jenny, a slender, petite, 32-year-old Ph. D. student with dark brown hair
*Jeannie, a curvy 37-year-old with dark brown hair
*Nancy, a 5 foot, 7 inch blond who is 34 and has an average figure
*Bonnie, a 42-year-old redhead with an average figure (this is the same Bonnie from the ""Best of What Not to Wear"" set)

The special reunion episode sadly only includes one of these women (Jeannie).  Marcy from the ""Best of"" set is on it, plus Belinda, Christina, Susan, Michaela, Melanie, and Dancing Nancy.",1261612800,14,1063,4.888888888888889
