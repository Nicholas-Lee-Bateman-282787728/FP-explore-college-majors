796211,5,6304084358,"This is the kind of socially-relevant James Thurber comedy Hollywood has all but forgotten how to make.  Fonda and everyone are great, with a surprisingly nice job by Jack Carson.  If you're a sports nut you won't  care for the hilarious, all-too-true digs at college sports -- but the  central theme of censorship still hits the mark, even if the movie is  almost 60 years old.  It's a dandy, lively story as well.  And if you have  an ounce of real American patriotism left (the more heartfelt kind, not the  soppy apple-pie variety), you might even cheer at the end.",940550400,8,569,4.61

796323,5,6304084358,I love these actors and grew up watching films of the 1930's - 1950's and I was a child of the 1960's. Olivia de Havilland and Henry Fonda you can't go wrong with these two. Then throw in some fine character actors like Edward Arnold and Jack Carson. This movie makes me laugh every time I watch it. Love seeing Hattie McDaniel in it too reuniting Olivia and Hattie from GWTW. Pure delicious and delightful. I bought this DVD for my parents and I have one too. Great price here at Amazon and good sound and movie quality. I like that it is still in black and white and not messed with.,1396915200,,585,4.232142857142857
796324,4,6304084358,"This 1942 movie is based on the hit 1940 Broadway play by James Thurber and Elliott Nugent (who also directed the movie). Henry Fonda plays Tommy Turner, an English professor at football mad Midwestern University. Olivia De Havilland is his wife, Ellen, who is somewhat miffed that her husband does not seem to love her as ardently as he once had. The school newspaper reveals that Tommy Turner would be reading a letter from Bartolomeo Vanzetti as an example of English composition. Given the notoriety of Sacco and Vanzetti as executed anarchists, the administration begin to put pressure on Prof. Turner to skip reading the letter. Fonda's character begins to question himself, as even his wife seems against the idea. The comedic subplot involves the homecoming football game, former star quarterback Joe Ferguson and the fact that Ellen and Jack once dated. Finally finding the resolve, Henry reads the letter to the astonishment of all, in several different ways. No need to reveal the ending here.

This is a fine movie with wonderful character actors such as Jack Carson as Joe Ferguson, the ever appealing Eugene Pallette as Ed Keller, school administrator, Hattie McDaniel, Don DeFore and Joan Leslie. Look for Gig Young in an uncredited role.

The quality of the recording is acceptable, as are most of the movies for Warner Bros. Archive Collection. It is about the same as a good VHS tape used to be. It has not been enhanced, but there are no serious issues and, being in black & white, there are no color problems either.",1395619200,4,1536,4.881226053639847
796325,5,6304084358,"Buried during the McCarthy era, this dramedy, (filmed long before they coined that phrase) gives a thoughtful look into a conflict of academic honesty in the face of a powerful administrators' paranoia of ""pinkos and reds,"" and  his strong preference for success in football. While Henry Fonda's job is at risk if he continues with his lesson plan to read a short letter by a famous anarchist to his English class, most everyone on campus (including his wife played wonderfully by Olivia de Havillon) is swept up by football fever.  Filmed in a period when many universities were struggling with balancing their sports program priorities, and with McCarthy and the Cold War not yet a part of the equation it is all the more thought provoking while still maintaining its comic spirit.",1356912000,,783,4.924242424242424
796326,5,6304084358,"This movie achieves much without much instigation.  A professor wants to read a letter in a classroom.  There isn't much more to it than that.  Yet, events quickly unfold that make this event into so much more.  The movie marvelously pits Collegiate Intellect against Collegiate Business, something which stands true today as much as it did when the movie was made.  Then toss in the side-by-side story of this professor and his relationship with his wife.

This film has intelligence, a bit of comedy and manages to deal with a significant issue of censorship in such a nonchalant, but very effective manner.  The cast is great, the script solid.  This film must be watched.",1244160000,7,675,4.859649122807017
796327,5,6304084358,"This smart comedy has to do with a visit paid by an old friend of the childhood to a professor, happily married until that...

But with a wife of the sidereal beauty of Olivia de Havilland, who can be absolutely innocent?

796328,5,6304084358,"At a time when patriotism is more and more being defined as unqustioning support of administration policy, THE MALE ANIMAL offers a timely reminder of what Americanism truly is.  I once heard a college president describe what  education should be as ""a window on the world, and a window is something you can look through from either side.""  This film provides a gentle reminder of the value of that insight.  I still cheer at the end--every time I watch it.",1060560000,12,457,4.675
796329,5,6304084358,"This a truly great film.  I enjoy is immensly. It's funny romantic, and very moving at parts.  Henry Fonda, is great as the English teacher husband and his wife, played by Olivia D'Havilland is so beautiful and charming. Jack Carson is funny and charming as well.  He's a greta ctor.  This is a must see movie, very decent, and one of a kind.  I'd recommend it to anyone. It's one you can never get tire of it.  Each time of viewing is like the first time.  The plot and story is never dull and always makes sence.",1045094400,2,514,4.237113402061856
796330,5,6304084358,"The innocence and straight forward holsom theme and action of this film make it one of my lifetime favorites. When something is bothering me, I like to play non-stressful movies and this is one of them. It'll be boring  to thrill seekers, but that's the point isn't it?",959299200,,269,4.604166666666667
796331,5,6304084358,"The Male Animal is a movie that has you think about such serious issues as censorship and what it means to be a man, yet it doesn't sacrifice any laughs.  Henry Fonda is perfectly cast as the professor who must learn  whether he is man enough, and he is well supported by a beautiful Olivia  deHavilland and a cast of good character actors.  Not enough attention has  been given to this movie over the years, and it deserves to be  re-discovered.  A great movie!",947289600,18,462,4.428571428571429
7863336,5,6304084358,"""I don't want any Communists in my university!  Go round up the REDS, and if you can't find any reds, round up the pinks.""  Says the university president during the movie.

A good comedy that deals with censorship on college campuses.  Sadly, the assault on free speech continues to escalate on America's college campuses. Shocking how many college campuses are actively suppressing ideas they don't agree with.

An excellent book on the subject censorship on college campuses can be found right here on Amazon.

Sadly, not burned on M-DISC

I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.",1502409600,,1219,5.470588235294118

7863338,5,6304084358,"The Male Animal is arguably one of the BEST screwball comedies ever made. Henry Fonda and Olivia DeHavilland alongside such greats as Jack Carson and Hattie MacDaniel. Just a tour da farce when Fonda, a nerdy English professor decides to read a controversial excerpt to his class by a Communist author. The walls come tumbling down and the hilarity that ensues is genuinely genius! Lots of heart, lots of laughs, lots of acting you just don't see much of anymore!",1490572800,,463,4.8

7863345,4,6304084358,"McCarthyism appears in movie from the World War II era, along with shadows of the fascist threat in the USA. An English professor wants to read a Vanzetti  letter in his writing class. Trustees want all the reds, pinks of whatever hue- removed from the faculty. The professor is apolitical. On his home front the wife is attracted to an old flame, a football star, but remains a loyal wife. The younger sister is attracted to a star football team player and also to unintellectual type [father in the later Dennis the Menace TV show] who editorializes in the school paper about the trustees fascism.
 A key scene is the football rally, the burning bonfire in the background, shown as linking the competitiveness of USA sports, its loyalties and enthusiasms, to fascism, team spirit lapsing into mindless and enforced conformity; the ballplayers introduced on stage appear ready to join the SS, their demeanor sullen and savage.
 Also notable is Fondas speech about free speech and civil rights at the end of the film. McCarthyism is rejected by all at the films end as all join a triumphant parade celebrating true Americanism, that of civil rights.
 What is the real man, the physically endowed and good-natured team player, the hero to the community or the more isolated intellectual with moral standards. The question makes the indecision of the wife a compelling aspect, rivaling the political themes.",1412812800,,1405,4.965957446808511
