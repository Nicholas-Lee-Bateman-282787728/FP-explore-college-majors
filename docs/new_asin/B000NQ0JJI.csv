8180602,5,B000NQ0JJI,"Okay, I'll be reviewing the six seasons of ""Roseanne"" offered here, so this might be quite lengthy. I think I should start off by saying that ""Roseanne"" is a bona-fide sitcom classic, pure and simple. Pretty much up until this time, middle-class American families just weren't represented entirely accurately on television. The closest we has was ""All In The Family,"" but, at least in my case, that's stretching it. I honestly never knew any families like the Cleavers, the Bradys, or the Huxtables. But I definately knew families like the Conners. Over-worked parents, bratty kids, real-life situations, I definately could relate to this show. And Roseanne herself was definately a rarity as far as television mothers go. She was loud, crass, and pretty much take no prisoners. Needless to say, I loved every second of it. Of course, later on the series began to dive into the absurd, but since the final three seasons will not be reviewed here (I'll review those separately when they are released) they will not be discussed. While the series started off exceptionally strong in seasons one and two, seasons three, four, five, and six are truly ""Roseanne"" in its prime. By this time, the writing truly sizzled, and the cast knew their parts frontwards and backwards. Most of the main cast are phenomenal, not only in their comic timing, but in thier performances overall. Of course Roseanne Barr is excellent as Roseanne Conner, that's pretty much a given. John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf simply excell was Dan Conner, and Jackie Harris (Roseanne's sister), respectively. However, my all-time favorite character on the show is definately Darlene Conner (Sara Gilbert.) The way she dead pans everything, coupled with excellent comic timing is a wonder. Michael Fishman and Lecy Goranson are also good as DJ and Becky Conner. The main cast swelled later on to include Becky's boyfriend, later on husband Mark Healy (the late, phenomenal Glenn Quinn) and his brother David Healy (the excellent Johnny Galecki) who later on marries Darlene. Here I will give a synopsis of each season, including episode highlights:

Season One: This is the season that started it all. In this season, Roseanne and Jackie work at Wellman Plastics, along with their friend Crystal (Natalie West.) This is probably the weakest season of the bunch, but overall the quality is excellent. George Clooney makes an impression as Roseanne's boss (and Jackie's boyfriend) Booker. Unfortunately, the DVD features the syndicated cuts of the episodes taking the rating down a notch. Memorable episodes: ""Life and Stuff,"" ""Lovers' Lane,"" ""Saturday,"" ""Canoga Time,"" ""Nightmare On Oak Street,"" ""Mall Story,"" ""Toto, We're Not In Kansas Anymore,"" ""Death and Stuff,"" and ""Let's Call It Quits."" (4/5)

Season Two: This is the season where Jackie becomes a cop, Roseanne tries to find a new job after quitting Wellmans, and Roseanne gets a job at the beauty parlor. Overall, this season is stronger than the first. The writing had definately improved over the first season, and the actors were more comfortable in their roles. Memorable Episodes: ""Inherit The Wind,"" ""Boo!,"" ""No Talking,"" ""Chicken Hearts,"" ""One For The Road,"" ""I'm Hungry,"" and ""Happy Birthday."" (4.5/5)

Season Three: Here is where the show really took off. There are just so many classic episodes this season. This is the season where Roseanne starts working at Rodbell's (much to Becky's horror!), Leon Carp (Martin Mull) is introduced, Darlene starts getting a crush on a boy, Jackie quits the force, and best of all, Mark makes his debut in the episode ""Becky, Beds, and Boys"" (much to Roseanne's horror!) Memorable Episodes: ""The Test,"" ""Like A Virgin,"" ""Becky, Beds, and Boys,"" ""Trick or Treat,"" ""PMS, I Love You,"" ""Bird Is The Word,"" ""Do You Know Where Your Parents Are?,"" ""Home-Ec,"" ""Her Boyfriend's Back,"" ""Dances With Darlene,"" and ""Scenes From A Barbecue."" (6/5)

Season Four: The quality remained much the same in the fourth season. This is the season where Roseanne and Dan open the bike shop, Darlene starts wearing black and becomes reclusive, Becky goes on birth control, Jackie becomes a truck driver, and Roseanne and Jackie discover that their father is cheating on their mother. This is a very high quality season of the show, and remains a classic season. Memorable Episodes: ""A Bitter Pill To Swallow,"" ""Darlene Fades To Black,"" ""Trick Me Up, Trick Me Down,"" ""Thanksgiving 1991,"" ""Santa Claus,"" ""Bingo,"" ""The Commercial Show,"" and ""Aliens."" (6/5)

Season Five: This season starts off with a bang when Becky elopes with Mark and they move to Minneapolis. (Sadly, this meant Lecy Goranson's departure for three seasons, and Glenn Quinn's departure for one season.) On top of that, Roseanne and Dan are forced to close the bike shop. On a happier note, Darlene and David start becoming serious about each other, and apply to art schools in New York and Chicago. This is the season where David comes to live with the Conners. This is also the season where Roseanne and Jackie open the immortal Lunch Box restaurant. This season also tackled some difficult topics such as being a lesbian, Roseanne's father passing on, David's mother's verbal abuse, and Jackie being in an abusive relationship, This is such a classic season, with many excellent episodes. Memorable Episodes: ""Terms of Estrangement (Parts I & II),"" ""The Dark Ages,"" ""Pretty In Black,"" ""Halloween IV,"" ""Ladies' Choice,"" ""Good Girls, Bad Girls,"" ""Its No Place Like Home For The Holidays,"" ""Crime And Punishment,"" ""War And Peace,"" ""Lanford Daze,"" ""Wait Till Your Father Gets Home,"" ""It's A Boy,"" ""Tooth or Consequences,"" and ""Daughters and Other Strangers."" (6/5)

Season Six: This is probably my favorite seaon of the entire series. There are so many classic episodes this season. In this season, Darlene goes to college, Roseanne finds marijuana in the basement, Leon returns, Jackie becomes pregnant and marries Fred, Darlene and David move in together, and Roseanne and Jackie visit a gay bar. Best of all, Mark and Becky are back! Well, Glenn Quinn is back, but there's something different about Becky. Here, Becky is played by Sarah Chalke, who is filling in for Lecy Goranson, who will return in season eight. I thought Sarah Chalke did an admirable job as the grown-up Becky, considering the huge disadvantages she had, having never worked with the cast before. Also, Dan admits his mother to a mental hospital. John Goodman gives his best perfomance of the entire series in the episode ""Lies My Father Told Me."" Roseanne also gives her best performance in the episode ""The Driver's Seat,"" where she spanks DJ, and instantly regrets it, remembering the way her father used to treat Roseanne and Jackie. This season also contains my all-time favorite episode ""White Trash Christmas."" This episode is so gut-bustingly hilarious. Its hysterical watching the Conners go all-out decorating their house with trashy Christmas lawn decorations, Dan giving Mark marital advice, Bev and DJ surprising Darlene with a trip to see ""The Nutcracker,"" and Becky getting a job at the Hooters-like restaurant BUNZ. I also love the immortal episode ""A Stash From The Past."" The bathroom scene has to be seen to be believed, its that hysterical! Memorable Episodes: ""Two Down, One To Go,"" ""A Stash From The Past,"" ""Halloween V,"" ""Homeward Bound,"" ""Homecoming,"" ""Thanksgiving '93,"" ""The Driver's Seat,"" ""White Trash Christmas,"" ""Suck Up Or Shut Up,"" ""Busted,"" ""David vs. Goliath,"" ""Everyone Comes To Jackie's,"" ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" ""Past Imperfect,"" ""Lies My Father Told Me,"" ""I Pray The Lord My Stove To Keep,"" and ""Alter Egoes."" (7/5)
