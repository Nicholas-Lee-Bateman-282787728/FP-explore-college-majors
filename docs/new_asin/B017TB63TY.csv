7533621,3,B017TB63TY,Was interesting for a while.  Political world of football.,1455580800,,58,5.444444444444445
7533622,5,B017TB63TY,"Great explanation of what happened to Mitch Mustain. He got screwed by two grown men with an elementary school style ego fight. Then went to Califorinia and realized there is a world outside of s***hole Arkansas and meathead football. Grew up as a man. Paid for that great experience with the talents he developed as a kid. Football took him there, California gave him experiences and views that most simple minded Razorbacks cant relate to, and now he gets to use that to live a life. Sheep beat a path. Glad you are no longer a sheep. Enjoy your new path.",1455062400,2,557,4.524752475247524
7533623,3,B017TB63TY,"First, I agree there is a story here but it isn't told very well. It still misses certain points about the meathead mindset of athletics in this country and especially in the South. Sadly that is better covered in a movie like Varsity Blues. I wish good things for Mr. Mustain. He has nothing to be ashamed of and his story is a great cautionary tale it just isn't captured here as well as it could have been.
Second, what is with all the goofy crotch shots of Mitch Mustain? I counted 7. At first the camera, sort of, lingers to hand gestures but the last two - there were no hands in the shot. The 6th was right after Malzahn quits coaching at Arkansas and the 7th around the whole adderall thing. Why? The camera also annoyingly drifts all over or does quick zooms a few times. I understand this lends energy to otherwise boring interviews but is way overdone.
As Matthew Wolfe is credited for direction, writing, editing AND shares credit for cinematography, I look at him for these oddities.",1454544000,,996,4.478021978021978

7533625,5,B017TB63TY,"I really enjoyed this movie. If you enjoy 30 for 30 on ESPN - or sports documentaries in general - you would love this film. The creator takes a story that probably most everyone outside of Arkansas has never heard - and tells  it in such a way that it just completely draws you in. The story is fantastic. I found myself thinking that I wish I would have been following this story when it was actually happening, and I hated that I missed it. I think so many times we never get to hear the ""other side"" of a story and I think the filmmaker did a great job here really trying to show the story in a fair way and it was great. I really enjoyed it.",1452902400,,646,4.007751937984496
7533626,5,B017TB63TY,"I grew up in Northwest Arkansas, and remember this story very well. I was at the game when Mitch scored his first TD vs USC.
This does a great job of telling the other half of the story. Everyone just assumed that Houston Nutt was right about Mitch. After watching this it really opened my eyes to what really happened. As a Hogs fan it really makes me wonder what could have been.
Great documentary! Highly recommended!",1452384000,2,420,4.467532467532467
7533627,5,B017TB63TY,"I went into this a complete virgin to the story.  I've lost most of my interest in sports, but the trailer piqued my interest in this particular situation.  The story was told in a way that kept my attention, and made sure that I would be able to keep track of the people and chronology.  As a viewer, I deeply appreciated the care the film took in ensuring that I always knew who the characters are and how they were tied into the larger scope of the tale.

I love documentary films and non-fiction writing for their power to capture and hold my attention when the subject is, in fact, of little apparent interest to me at the beginning.  This is a kind of pure story-telling that I hope to experience more of in the future.

A quibble, but maybe more than that, is the title, which just doesn't work and is confusing.  There was nothing in the film that had a thing to do with identify theft in the general sense.  Whatever the subject may have had taken from him, it certainly had nothing to do with any loss of identity, damaged sense of self, or anything like that.  Identity theft is a poor choice of words to describe what happened to Mr. Mustain.

Anyway, the interviewees were wonderful and provided a necessary analysis of the situations that developed.  Mustain, in particular, was an extremely articulate and level-headed guy.",1451347200,14,1338,4.533333333333333
7533628,4,B017TB63TY,"It is unreal that this 18 year had 8 straight wins without a shot at getting the starting position back.  Yes this freshman QB struggled.  This is why a coach is there.  Still, 8 - 0 is pretty damn good.  Too bad the head coach let his ego get in the way.  The offensive coordinator isn't faring much better.

Overall, a well done film.",1526774400,,336,4.171875
7533629,4,B017TB63TY,"as a lifelong usc fan i remember all that drama coming from the south that surrounded the whole ordeal with his family and high school coach. but i never knew how bad and polarizing it really was until i watched this documentary. when he came down here to Southern Cal i thought he would one day start. but his overly laid back and some what introverted demeanor made me second guess. but what i would've liked to have seen was Damian Williams, his high school and arkansas team mate who transferred with him in this documentary. i know he turned down an interview but his career some what went on an opposite path, becoming a star wide receiver and making it in the nfl albeit his career was ended by injuries and that he's now out of the nfl and just got arrested for assault and battery. Damian was the opposite in terms of personality he was more outgoing and his explosive talent stood out on the field. but all in all, i liked this documentary and have much more respect for mustain as an individual who is far from perfect but true to himself and accepts his flaws.",1526688000,,1072,4.391959798994975
7533630,5,B017TB63TY,"I really enjoyed this film. I was engaged so much I even put off doing a well needed errand.
I have 5 boys that played football all of their youth and to see how cruel people can be when they really don't understand the whole story is horrible. It happened even to some fellow teammates of my kids at high school level.
For Mitch, it is  inexcusable what Hutt did to him.
We as parents and adults have a duty to help children become strong, upstanding adults and to let them down like this Hutt had done, it is a hurtful shame.",1525737600,,527,4.166666666666667
7533631,1,B017TB63TY,"An absolutely excruciating and trite piece of film. Mitch Mustain is interesting and certainly has an interesting story, but this ESPN 30 for 30 wannabe is so tedious and full of needless affectations (like ceaseless camera panning to interviewees' hands) that you'll be rolling your eyes and thinking ""just get the hell on with it"" a half hour into the viewing...and then you'll realize with utter dismay you've still got an hour and ten minutes left. A better filmmaker could've told this story in 45 minutes to an hour, tops.",1524268800,,528,4.877777777777778
7533632,4,B017TB63TY,"I do not follow college football closely, but I tend to watch all documentaries that have to do with football. And this is an interesting story. Although it sounds like a typical story of the rise and fall of a promising QB, the documentary looks at many aspects of this story, and how things can wrong, including the mistakes that the player himself made. But taking this story in the broad context of the business that football is, this documentary gives us a notion why we do not know of a Mitch Mustain on the NFL and gives us an idea of his story is that of so many other players. You never here about these kind of failures only for successes and the real american pro athletes. But through this documentary you get to realize of all the problems that the sports system has created in the USA, which raises some athletes to Olympian status and leaves many others to a life of sporting obscurity and old news clippings!",1519603200,,924,4.4411764705882355

7533638,4,B017TB63TY,This is an excellent group of contributors speaking in this movie. I was impressed with how articulate and insightful Mitch Mustain is. Really good movie if you are a sports fan. The title says it all....the trolls and coaches really did steal his identity from him and he was too trusting to know it was happening until it was too late.,1509840000,,337,4.540983606557377

7533643,4,B017TB63TY,"This is a decent film.  Done in a 30 for 30-like fashion (without the flashy cinematography), it does portray a side of sports that touches the human element.  I never heard of Mitch, but now I know why.

As a football fan, it doesn't do justice to how good he or the team was but rather paints him as a superior victim of Gus Malzan and Houston Nutt.

Worth a watch when you don't have other priorities going on.",1497225600,,413,4.189873417721519
7533644,4,B017TB63TY,"This was interesting and definitely worth watching if you're a Hog fan. Nolan Richardson was an interesting choice for a narrator, but he did well overall. Most of the stuff in this documentary was pro-Mustain, no doubt. There are several lines that Nolan Richardson says at one point: ""we did wrong,"" or something of that nature. I thought that was weird, but I think that Mustain is a good guy. I hope him the best, they were fun to watch.",1490054400,,441,4.525

I like to believe that everything happens for a reason and for me, I feel like MM is a kindred spirit. Wishing MM (and me) peace, happiness, and success.

This would have been more suited for a 30 min ESPN 30/30. I also don't get the ""Identity Theft"" part of the title.

7533660,2,B017TB63TY,"This documentary could be more interesting if it wasn't so one sided. It is narrated by Nolan Richardson and stars Mustain. These are the two men that the athletic staff screwed over the most. However, Mustain played a large part in his own demise. He committed then decommitted then committed again to Arkansas, chose to release a statement calling the coach he was about to play for an idiot, and then chose to transfer to a school with two all star quarterbacks already. Houston Nutt is clearly a dick, but I just don't think Mustain had the emotional maturity to make it. I remember sitting beside his mom and grandma at a game, and they are clearly toxic. They spent the whole game screaming out obscenities about the program. By the end of the doc you see he is a little off. It sucks that we had such a talented team, and both Nutt and Mustain's egos and emotional immaturity ruined it! This documentary needs Malzahn, Nutt, Mustain's mother and some more of the razorback players at the time instead of just Mustain. It just doesn't fully depict the whole story.",1483401600,,1070,4.607329842931938

7533668,4,B017TB63TY,"The story of Mitch Mustain was introduced to me by a local football coach.  Having not known all the details I found the story intriguing.
I thought the documentary was VERY well done, however, I only gave it 4 stars because they did not interview some key players in the life of
Mustain including 1) his mom  2) Coach Malzahn (his High School coach, his Arkansas Offensive Coordinator, and now Auburn Coach) 3)  Pete Carroll (coach at USC), 4) Houston Nutt (Coach at Houston. 5) Mark Sanchez or Matt Barkley (QBs who started over him at USC), 6) other key Arkansas team mates such as McFadden or Jones who were key players on Mitch's team his Freshman year.

Its hard to accept any implication that they had a hand in the ""identity theft"" without getting their perspective or the opportunity to defend any accusations.

The documentary did compile some great video footage of games or interviews taken ""at that time"" as well as some really great insight in to Mitch Mustain himself.  Mitch is a very articulate, well-spoken individual who makes no accusations or excuses for his tenure on any football team or post-football life.

The problem with this documentary is that Frank Broyles, Houston Nutt, and Gus Malzahn aren't interviewed, so you really don't get the whole story.

As it is, nobody comes out of this looking good. For Mustain's freshman year, Arkansas had a backfield that included Darren McFadden, Felix Jones, and Peyton Hollis (3 future NFL starting RBs). All he needed to do that first year was hand the ball off, occasionally pass, and settle into the college game. All that Houston Nutt had to do was let Malzahn handle the offense. Instead, it ended up being a colossal mess.

Mustain comes across as an unaccountable kid with a big ego. I understand wanting to get out of Arkansas after that first year, but he then transfer to the worst possible situation at USC where he's behind two future NFL QBs.

I understand that Mitch wanted to be able to tell his side of the story. The problem is that his side of the story doesn't really make him a very sympathetic person.",1479513600,,1132,4.454106280193237

7533688,5,B017TB63TY,"This is a great film which, in my view, attempts to gives an accurate depiction of ""what happened"" to Mitch and to Razorback football. Having been a lifetime Hog fan, I was not surprised to see the dysfunction in our football program. The program was especially dysfunctional under the (lack of) leadership we had with head coach Houston Nutt. Thank goodness for the changes!

What happened to Mitch was a total shame. Houston Nutt and Frank Broyles and many in the Razorback Football program tried to blame a boy, an 18 year old boy, for their many failings and insecurities.

So many rumors were spread about Mitch as well as the other ""Springdale 5"". Unfair, untrue and it was nice to see the film give an unbiased view of how these supposed adults, responsible for character development of these student athletes failed. Instead, they left a path of destruction!

the film won't leave you feeling warm and fuzzy. It's too little too late for Mitch, but I hope more people watch the film. Maybe we can learn from our mistakes. Good luck Mitch, wherever you are!

Though I am not an Arkansas fan, I was happy to see him commit to his home-state team even though he could have hand picked any program in the country. It is so unfortunate how things ended. I was totally unaware of the whole drama that surrounded Mustain's career at Arkansas until I watched this movie. Though I am sure the documentary is not a 100% accurate representation of the true events (there are always two sides), I do know that college football coaches have massive egos and so it would not surprise me if the drama surrounding Nutt were true. It is sad that kids have such pressure put on them at such early ages and are forced to grow up so soon. It is also unfortunate that adults get in the way of the development of kids due to pride. I was extremely impressed by Mitch. He is well-spoken, thoughtful, and doesn't come across the least bit bitter by his experiences. He certainly got a bad hand dealt to him and his present could have been so much different than what it is. I can't say that I would be as mature and somewhat at peace with what has happened as he is. Good for him. This is an extremely interesting documentary for anyone that likes college football, child development, or sociology.",1475625600,2,1271,4.435897435897436

I think the more compelling part of this doc was the power struggle between Malzahn and Houston Nutt. I don't remember any of that conflict and I really wanted to hear more about it.,1475452800,,402,4.597222222222222

I remember watching Mitch Mustain's first game for Arkansas against USC and thought he was going to be something really special. Then, as a USC fan, I was thrilled when it was announced he was coming to SoCal. I felt bad for him not getting playing time until the 2010 Notre Dame game, and losing a chance for glory when Ronald Johnson dropped the winning touchdown (which ended an 8-game winning streak over the Irish.) Now I know the backstory, and I feel even more awful for Mitch, and how his potential was never realized. Yet I get the unshakable sense that, deep down. Mitch Mustain is at peace with the trajectory of his life, and that if he found something to work at full time that really interested him, like foreign affairs, he would be excited and never look back. Hope he finds that--whatever it is. I highly recommend this movie to any college sports fan.  BTW Houston Nutt IMHO is a complete horse's ass.

Mitch Mustain, an all-everything quarterback in the making if there ever was one, was a star in high school in Alabama and was destined to be a star in college and the NFL.

I liked the first hour or so as it followed his promising career and the issues that arose. A good documentary provides balanced coverage of both sides of the issues. This documentary is clearly skewed in blaming the system and people that supposedly failed Mustain. The fact remains that Mustain made a really stupid decision to sell his prescriptions drugs and to then be arrested for it. To imply that he is not really responsible for the repercussions from that decision is irresponsible and it doesn't send such a good message to kids who may have looked up to him as a role model.

But scrolling through amazon Prime Video, I stumbled across this documentary and watched it, with rapt attention--twice--two nights in a row!  It is a fascinating story of an extremely talented young man, considered just a few years ago to be the best high school quarterback in the U.S.  It seemed the sky would be the limit, as far as his career was concerned.  But the limit turned out to be 8 college football games.  As a result of awful political wrangling behind the scenes, he was benched and played no more.  This is a heartbreaking story of a young man with so much promise who was repeatedly betrayed by those he trusted.  I thought the title was misleading, but I must admit it did grab my attention.  It seemed like the makers of the movie felt that many around Mitch were responsible for stealing his identity, and that he was so anxious to please that he was not sure who he was.  I'm not at all sure that's true.  He had many pressures and stresses to deal with at a very young age, and that is a problem for anyone.  I wish more people had agreed to be interviewed, e.g., his mother, Gus Malzahn,  Damian Williams, etc.  But those who were interviewed provided kind, astute, and articulate insight, and over all, this is a wonderfully moving film about a young man whose story will stay with you long after you've seen it.",1470355200,8,1425,4.498054474708171

7533790,5,B017TB63TY,"This was a very good documentary; entertaining, engaging and emotionally involving. I'm not a Razorbacks fan but I always wondered why such a highly gifted quarterback like Mitch Mustain had gone 7-0, only to be benched after only on interception, early in his ninth game. Something was amiss and just didn't make any sense to me. Having watched this documentary really made it clear to me. It's unfortunate that coach Nutt behaved so badly; inappropriate and fallacious. I didn't have much of an opinion of Houston Nutt before this, other than he was a colorful personality from what I had seen on TV. After viewing this documentary, I think very poorly of coach Nutt now. To take out his frustrations caused by selfish insecurity and on a 19 year old young man is so iniquitous and reprehensible. If he didn't want him to play, he should have stated that clearly and to his face.

The documentary was directed very well. It told the story very well and kept me engaged. They did a good job of bringing many pieces(facts and figures) together. I went into this film with a small amount of interest only because I remembered who Mitch Mustain was and him being benched after a 7-0 record. After only a few minutes, I was hooked. I got a much clearer picture of who the people were who were involved in Mustain's story.

This documentary made me feel even worse for young Mitch Mustain, now knowing what he had gone through behind the scenes but it made me admire him tremendously for having handled it so well at such a young age.",1469577600,10,1530,4.6007326007326

We'll make it work, it will work, it's working, it's not, every man for himself. Houston Nutt bears blame for this fiasco as well, his inability to stay the course, and play his game plan doomed this to failure from the beginning. Some would say he was in an impossible situation, well that's why you're the coach, you call the shots.

 A pretty good look at Mustain, he compounds his problems by heading to USC to prove he can play big league ball rather than making a sideways jump plays second/third fiddle to Marc Sanchez who was playing great ball leading USC to 3 rose bowl championships. Some stupid mistakes cost him a look from the NFL, to me Mustain never was a NFL QB, what do I know?

As far as the hate he receives, it's pretty sad, none of this was done out of evil intent, more naivete, wrong choices manifested, dudes' not a bad guy by any stretch. I guess some people will never let up, to Mustain I would say stay off the chat boards and don't defend yourself, nothing will change with those individuals.",1468627200,7,1377,4.434782608695652

There are people that other people find them not interesting at all, it is part of what you are and if you are not strong enough you could be in deep troubles with yourself. There is a movie called *61[...] ""Aiming for one of the most famed records in sports history, a pair of very different baseball players hit home runs at an impressive rate. Roger Maris (Barry Pepper), a reserved sort, is much less popular than his hard-partying New York Yankee teammate Mickey Mantle (Thomas Jane), the player who many observers think will be the one to challenge Babe Ruth's record of 60 home runs in one season. But in the summer of 1961, Maris surges ahead of Mantle, making a run at Ruth's mark.""

Selling cars was a good choice for Mitch. With the possible exception of Lee Iaccoca, car salesmen have more integrity and human decency than any football coach I've met, played for or worked for. Football brings out our worst traits: it teaches that hurting people is admirable, that it is right and good to manipulate, to lie and to cheatwhat matters is winning and being a ""hero,"" which forgives all sins including the growing number of rapes and assaults in our colleges. The hero-disease infects most sports. Ali taught two generations that it is proper and right to be a vicious, loud mouthed thug and rhyme about it. Lance Armstrong, arms raised high at the finish line, taught us that cheating is the American Way.  People who believe in heroes are saps and saps are losers.",1467504000,,960,4.748502994011976

7533941,4,B017TB63TY,"Fascinating portrait of someone who lived on the very outer edges of my consciousness as a more than casual college football fan (but less than a ""Mel Kiper-like Zombie"").  None of this will make sense until you watch the program but the description of Mustain folding and refolding an Arkansas Schedule until he tore it into exactly identical squares is fascinating for what it reveals about the deep quirkiness that is Mitch and some underlying but tangential personality traits.  Selling Adderol on Craig's List is so wonderfully immature as to be laughable.  I came away wondering what Mitch could have been if he hadn't stopped selling the Aderol and actually continued to take it - perhaps a less authentic version of himself (but who really knows).  The commentators were tremendous but I found the Nolan Richardson narration less than compelling.  I had to keep reminding myself that Nolan Richardson was both an integral part of Arkansas and a man who always felt ""just outside the ring"" of authentic Arkansansans.  What the show really begged for was a follow-up on Mitch 2 or 3 years further down the line and for god's sake, an in-depth look at Gus Malzone (sic).  We are left with the impression of Gus as a single minded man on the move up with only small regard for those he temporarily convinces to be a part of his ""family.""  This is so at odds with how ABC/ESPN have painted of him during his recent successful run at Auburn that it really makes you stop and think whether or not he is a truly sincere or just sincere in the moment - a carnival barker or a truly caring human being.

He attempted to sell his adderall prescription in college on craigslist because he was screaming for attention, attention he once had but did not get once he became a back up.  Gus Malzahn never responded when asked to be a part of this film and I would make an educated guess that his reasoning is because he could not believe that this was something worthy of a documentary.  Mitch Mustain hopefully learned his lesson and next time won't open his mouth about other individuals, especially those that decide on his playing time.  If he never made the comment about his head coach while he was the starting freshman QB, he probably would have never been yanked.

7533953,5,B017TB63TY,"Excellent documentary.  Really tells an interesting story.

I think the ADD medicine business Mustain took a hit for is representative of a VERY common practice at USC/UCLA, i.e. peddling medicines to classmates or others online.  Stupid of USC and NFL to over-dramatize that.  Mustain took the fall and it was BS

And as somebody said to the effect in the doc,  ""the adults blew it, here.""  Not sure what the story was with the piggy-back coaching arrangement in Arkansas, but that seems like a good way to have team-management problems that come at a severe expense to an athlete(s).  And USC's oversight of a scholarship-athlete prescribed amphetamines (on THEIR watch) should have been a TON (!) better.  Ridiculous.

As for Mustain's alleged personality ""identify-theft"" deal  the docs title -- I say yes and no.  The adults, the coaches were looking at his effectiveness on the field.  And frankly, high school and first year at Arkansas, his numbers were outstanding.  So no there.  However, I think USC is academically a steeper-climb and may be a bit of a mind-opener, so  sure  maybe Mustain found himself thinking beyond football and merely pleasing the adults that surrounded him at that point.  So, that may be the yes part.  Adults start getting disappointed and its like:  hey guys, hold on here; got my own life.

If it was me, however, I personally would have advised Mustain to stay on a low dose of Adderall and not dump it altogether (yes, I know the side-effects of using).  Hes a guy that medically needed it  not just some student looking for a boost.

And personally, I'd advise Mustain to relocate back to LA -- once you've bitten that apple, there's no going back to Arkansas or wherever, without feeling like you're missing something.  Lots of USC alum that can hook him up,  he's got a Hollywood name, ""Mitch Mustain"" and could probably do some commercial, dramatic and/or TV work, stunt-work and sell real estate and all that while getting the ball rolling on the media side of things.  This doc is a good kick-off for that.

Anyway, good doc, Wolfe  (And don't read the comments on forums, Mustain  they're all just jelly and haterz and trying to make themselves big by hating on you, dude lol!)",1464998400,,2225,4.778947368421052

7533973,5,B017TB63TY,"I've coached for over 12 years, and sadly I see this type of outcome more often than not. The moment a coach puts himself and his ego above the team and the players, is the moment that coach loses the very same integrity and loyalty he based his entire foundation off of. At the college level, the truth of the matter is that players become less humanized and more numerized. They become a slot in a depth chart. A ranking on a sliding scale. It was once said that a football coach can impact and touch more lives in a season than what most people can do in a lifetime. I truly believe that statement. With that said, the game is like heroin. It isn't as simple and blocking and tackling. There are webs and veins that burrow far beyond the depths of politics, ego's, corruption, dishonesty, lack of integrity, selfishness, and disloyalty. It is sadly ironic, because in most every situation it is the football coach that are the one's who fall short more often times than the player in these instances. There is no innocence left in the game. The human fault has made sure of that. That is why now more than ever we need football coaches that love their players and live by that love and commitment. They don't chase the next big paycheck. They don't give up on a kid. They don't give in to heavy fisted boosters. They don't up and leave their football family unannounced. I can obviously go on and on, however this is a movie review and I suspect I better get around to it. I will end with, although Mitch made his mistakes and own decisions, some great, some not so great, I believe that he has come to terms with that. However, both Houston Nutt and Gus Malzahn failed this young man in every way possible. Houston Nutt failed simply as a leader. He was the Head Football coach, and his ego trumped what was best for the team. He handled the situation terribly and it trickled into that locker room. A strong leader would have seen this as a tremendous opportunity to use a unique situation as a magnetic to pull the entire team, staff, and fan base together. Houston Nutt failed to do this and is no longer coaching, which is probably for the best. As disappointing as Houston Nutt's incompetency was, the real monster in this situation is Gus Malzahn. Mitch confided in this man as a father figure and Gus rode that trust and loyalty to a stepping stone opportunity for bigger paycheck's and an eventual HFC position. I don't enjoy bashing coaches, because I believe we need to stick together, but I refuse to agree with the way these two grown men mishandled a bunch of young men, in particular Mitch. They didn't want to be a part of this I would imagine because as a coach grows older, so does his regrets. I would like to hope that both Houston Nutt and Gus Malzahn would eventually be man enough to meet with Mitch and apologize for the way they mishandled the entire situation. I'm not a psychiatrist, but I believe that is what Mitch is truly seeking. He continued with sports to prove those who he believed in, like Gus, wrong...however he failed to succeed because he was never playing truly for himself....he was playing for Gus, his father figure, the guy who loved him when needed a father's love. I've seen it a million times. Young people will go above and beyond their abilities to show their loyalty to their coach to will their team to victory. It is no more than a cry out for acceptance and to get a hug and hear ""I love you, son"". Gus should be ashamed. Houston should be ashamed. The core of coaching is caring. You care and love your players on and off the field. Period. If you want to do it the right way, you park in the farthest spot from building, you drink only after all your players drink, you are the last to go home, you take the time to speak with every player not just about football, but about life. Maybe my statement is invalid or wrong because I'm not making the millions Gus is, and if so that is fine, but I do know this...the game will too eventually leave Gus and Houston just like it has left Lombardi. Take a lesson from the dead, don't just talk the talk....walk the walk. Love your players like the son's that they are.

As for the movie review....5 stars. Nicely done:)",1460592000,2,4222,4.412820512820513

7533977,4,B017TB63TY,"A good accounting of the events which lead to Mitch Mustain's arrival to and subsequent departure from the Arkansas Razorbacks football program.  A lot of the film revolves around interviews with Mustain, who presents himself fairly, but perhaps the documentary.  The documentary could have been improved by the inclusion of more voices, specifically those at the center of events, and who, understandably, declined to participate, such as current Auburn head coach, Gus Malzahn and former Ole Miss coach, Houston Nutt.  The documentary generally tries for a neutral and positive telling, not dwelling long on the terrible treatment that Mustain received from those in the Pro-Nutt camp.  A little more time could have been spent on the following fan division that followed Mustain's departure, such as the notorious FOIA requests and banners flown over the stadium calling for Nutt's termination.  With that said, the documentary probably could have benefited from a shorter run time, though in its present form nothing seems redundant, and it's questionable if a shorter cut could have been accomplished without some pain.",1458000000,3,1124,5.4

7533985,2,B017TB63TY,"This documentary was actually interesting to watch (well told). But like the other reviewers stated, the title of it is misleading. This is a story of a typical talented football player who didn't really have the drive to overcome obstacles placed in front of him. The actual story is not really remarkable at all and has happened to thousands of football players before him. And this is the same type of story that has happened to hundreds of millions of American kids (me being one of them) in normal life situations. People go astray at some point in their lives and if they don't have the drive and will to get back on the course they were on . . .  they won't reach a goal they were moving toward (wittingly or un-wittingly).",1456358400,3,730,4.488721804511278

8740598,3,B017TB63TY,"This is worth a watch, but it is also Very one-sided. This show is jam packed with bent and one sided facts. For example: a 17 year old star de-commits to Arkansas due to a OC coaching change. Then the same Mustain is being interviewed for a book being written about him and proceeds to call the Arkansas head coach an Idiot. After several things transpire, Mustain then changes his mind and now wants to go play for Arkansas with the same Head Coach he called an Idiot. Then the book is published 1/2 to 3/4 of the way through his freshman year which now has quotes from Mustain calling his current Arkansas Head Coach an Idiot. OH YEAH, that will never be a problem O-O.

It is also very suspicious that his mother and none of the coaches replied to requests for comments while this is being made.

8740604,3,B017TB63TY,"This was an interesting documentary, BUT it totally missed the mark by not including whether or not Mitch ever got a college degree!  It was all about his downfall in his quest to become an NFL quarterback and the poor choices he made in attempting to do so.  It's sad the way his prospective career was crushed by that loser Houston Nutt (as in NUT-JOB).  It also goes to show that if you go off to college on a sports scholarship, don't forget to focus on a COLLEGE DEGREE.  Mitch put all his eggs in one basket, and if something happens where that falls apart, there was nothing left.  He did nothing, it appears from watching this, with regard to actually pursuing some sort of career by way of a college degree.  His NFL dreams could have been crushed in so many ways (i.e. an injury) so you have to have something other than football (or any sport for that matter) to pursue and build your life around when the ""game"" is gone.  This poor guy ended up selling cars, because HE FAILED to focus on a college degree as what is really important.  AND, he doesn't seem to have a clue what he wants to do with his life; as if he isn't passionate about anything, but even worse, always gives up instead of grinding through to get to his goal.  Says he loves aviation and always wanted to join the Navy or something like that to be a pilot, yet when football is out the window instead of pursuing that type of career returns home to sell cars. Why isn't he taking a pilot's course or something, learning to fly, perhaps a career with Delta.  So many options, yet he spends his time selling cars and shooting bottles of water.  He's pretty much a lost person with no goals trying to ""re-do"" what is over and done with.  His counselor might want to help him pursue something (other than sports) so he can get on with his life, which he has so much left to live for and can live happily ever after.",1527292800,2,1892,4.298591549295774
