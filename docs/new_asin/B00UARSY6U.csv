7033853,3,B00UARSY6U,"This is a repackage of ""The Dead Inside.""

This is a me-too zombie film. During a viral zombie outbreak, a group of people hold up at a school because the mall has already been done twice. Time passes and relations develop during a music montage. With females in scarcity, this leads to some minor internal conflict as much of the film deals with developing personal relationships.

Zombies need the classic head shot to die. The title is a ""plot spoiler"" if such a thing is possible in a zombie film. What was unusual is that they wasted bullets target practicing on boxes, teaching civilians how to shoot when there were legions of zombies outside the fence. Think ""practice head shot."" It could have been a fun scene too...""Okay, now aim between the eyes of Prince Harry."" The film needed some light dialogue.

Worth a rental. $9.88 US Walmart",1435536000,4,846,4.702702702702703

8705050,4,B00UARSY6U,"I rented this awhile ago and just got around to reviewing it. I remember this was a surprisingly good low budget zombie movie. Took an interesting approach - basically a group of survivors taking shelter at a ""rescue center"" which turned out not to have been there anymore. Ie - the school had been over run, the rescuer's had pulled out, and  group of civilians and a cut off / lost military unit took shelter there in the midst of a zombie apocalypse in England. Has all the usual tropes of the genre but also explored some interesting concepts like group dynamics, the breakdown of military command and control, and friendly fire. (During the first encounter a soldier kills a survivor, thinking he was one of the infected when in reality he was running from the infected.) It was a good movie, a pleasant watch well worth the rental fee.",1471824000,,841,4.6066666666666665

8705052,1,B00UARSY6U,"Trusting in the mostly negative feedback this video garnered I opted for the SD rental and still feel like I got ripped off. A terrible movie just doesn't quite describe this horrible British take on the Zombie movie genre. Was it well shot? No. Was it well acted? No. Was the plot good or even halfway decent? No. There is simply nothing positive I can say about this movie other than Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for offering it for so relatively much for a rental of this quality.
I did have hopes that like many British low budget movies that perhaps this one would shine over similar budgeted American made movies but I, like the typical hoards that fill this movie like fleas on a stray dog, I was dead wrong.",1452384000,,725,4.458646616541353
