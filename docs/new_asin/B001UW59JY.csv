3814085,4,B001UW59JY,I enjoyed this program. I've recently started studying astronomy and this is good history for the instrumentation we must use.,1377993600,,126,5.35
3814086,5,B001UW59JY,This was a very well done overview of the history of the telescope. Its starts with Dutch experimenters in the 17th. C. and goes up to whats going on as of 2009. Neil DeGrasse-Tyson as usual does a superb job of narrating. A must for the astronomy history buff or any one interested in whats going on in astronomy today using state of the art telescopes.,1368489600,2,354,4.378787878787879
3814087,5,B001UW59JY,"It is what I expected. I am very fond of astronomy. The explanation the experts give in this video has the precise level of technical words  diletants like me might understand. I watch it over and over, because I also use it to improve my English skills (I am not a fluent speaker).",1356048000,,282,4.320754716981132
3814088,4,B001UW59JY,"This presentation is a synopsis of telescopes as interments from concept to concept. It cannot possibly cover everything and does not need to. But there is enough verbal information and pictures to hold your attention for the hour and possibly show you something you did not know. Of course it is now dated but if you are still remembering the physics of you school days, you are in for some new thoughts.

Bottom line is that you will not be disappointed and better still intrigued with 400 years of the telescope. And find yourself asking does dark matter?",1298332800,2,558,4.6938775510204085
3814089,3,B001UW59JY,"This DVD is very well made. It is obviously targeted at a general audience. But the title is misleading. When I made the purchase on Amazon I expected to get a complete history of the telescope. To me that is what ""400 Years of the Telescope"" meant. What we get instead is a bit of the beginnings of the telescope, like when Newton invented the reflector for example; then we switch quickly to modern instruments like the Hale Telescope of the Palomar Observatory. So overall it does cover 400 years, but there is very little material between the time of the invention of the telescope and today's instruments. On the other hand there is extensive coverage of various grand projects of future telescope building. In the process we get a chronological history of various key astronomical discoveries that were made with the telescope.

So the way I see it the ultimate goal of this documentary was more to give us a brief history of astronomy than a history of the telescope itself. In the end it was because of the misleading title that I gave it only three stars. Otherwise it would deserve an additional one based on the quality of the presentation alone. It's too bad, there would have been so much to say about the pioneers of optics and telescope building, like Galileo, Huygens, Cassegrain, Hook, Newton, Herschel, Fraunhofer, etc. For those who would be interested to read about the history of the telescope, I have added a list of recommendations:

""Stargazer"" by Fred Watson (2004)
""Eyes on the Universe"" by Isaac Asimov (1975)
""The History of the Telescope"" by Henry C. King (1955)
""The Telescope"" by Louis Bell (1922)",1263859200,36,1628,4.7695035460992905
3814090,3,B001UW59JY,"This program needed to be a mini-series rather than a one hour program.  There were too many historic and scientific facts crammed into too little time.  As a result much of the excitement and passion of astronomy was left out.  The bigger questions, such as ""How did the Universe Begin?"", ""How will it end"", and ""Is there life in other places in the Universe"" were quickly skimmed over or not discussed at all.

If I wanted to inspire someone's interest in science and the Universe I think the PBS series ""The Astronomers"" would be a much better choice in spite of it being rather dated.",1262131200,8,588,4.571428571428571
3814091,5,B001UW59JY,"Everything about this film is top notch, except at 60 minutes, I was left wanting more. Every one of the 60 minutes in the film is a gem, but it's so well done that you wish it could have been a 90 or 120 minute piece.

Neil deGrasse Tyson is a fine narrator, and his enthusiasm for the topic is present without sneaking through. Dr. Tyson loves astronomy, and sometimes his excitement can overwhelm. Here, he is right on the mark.

If you have even the most remote interest in astronomy or science, you'll enjoy this movie. You may also find yourself looking at telescope prices so that you can have the same experience as Galileo. (Quick bit of advice: if you do shop for telescopes, ignore claims of ""power."" What you really want is light-gathering ability, or the size of the lens. The bigger the scope, the more you'll get to see.)",1246147200,22,836,4.457516339869281
3814092,4,B001UW59JY,"This offers something for multiple audiences.  Of course, the chemistry- and physics-loving crowd will enjoy this.  Howerver, we science haters can get something out of this too.  The work speaks about how when new telescopes take images of outer space, they put them on the internet so that teens and artists can use them or be inspired by it.  The work said that we can say destructive meteors 30 years before they reach the Earth, the implication being that we'll have the technology to destroy them.  The work said that there are 300 Earth-like planets found, so maybe this will inspire or intrigue ""Star Wars"" and ""Star Trek"" fans.
For people who hate history, this only briefly deals with that topic.  It speaks of how great minds introduced the heliocentric model in contrast to the then-accepted geocentric one.  For the visually-stimulated, watching the CGI graphics is pleasurable on its own terms.  For history haters, this work does not dwell on the past.  It presents space as a wild frontier of which we do not know much.  For those interested in the future or pushing the envelope, that message will keep you watching.
I recall reading in middle school history classes that neither maps nor globes do justice to the physical shape and look of Earth.  This work points on how older telescopes made blurry images or had to keep getting longer.  This works speaks of the inventors who corrected these problems.  The work concludes with telescopes that will be as big as football fields that will record images that humans have never seen.
Remember when Bart Simpson looked into a telescope and said, ""Wow!  The universe sure is boring.""  It's comical that ""wow!"" and ""boring"" are being used in the same sentence.  Still, this documentary tries to interest those who care about space and those who don't give a toot.  Even its discussion of how color-various photographs tells us more than black-and-white ones will keeps those fascinated how like rainbow-like images.
I wish the work had more diverse interviewees.  Still, the work is much stronger and more interesting than the title would suggest.",1243036800,5,2111,4.932011331444759
3814173,5,B001UW59JY,Grandson who is crazy to learn about all things in space loved it.,1418515200,,66,4.153846153846154
3814174,5,B001UW59JY,It was great. I enjoyed hearing about what is being developed.,1416960000,,62,4.7272727272727275
3814175,5,B001UW59JY,"OK, I'm prejudiced ! I pretty much think anything narrated by Neil is great. This is an entertaining and educational look at what we have learned by leveraging the telescope.",1416873600,,174,4.833333333333333
3814176,4,B001UW59JY,Well done.,1413676800,,10,4.5
3814177,5,B001UW59JY,arrived on time.  product exactly as described.  very satisfied.,1413676800,,64,6.0
3814178,5,B001UW59JY,I fell asleep half way through it but the parts that I did see seemed informative.  They didn't get too technical and drew the story line out quite a bit but for someone that doesn't know anything about telescopes it should be good enough.,1411430400,,239,4.431818181818182
3814179,4,B001UW59JY,The title makes it sound like you will learn something about how different kinds of telescopes work and how they were developed. There is no such thing in this video! It mostly tells you about various telescope installations around the world.,1411084800,,242,4.926829268292683
3814180,5,B001UW59JY,"Great documentary. It made me appreciate even more how powerful Jehovah is. It is beautiful! I was also impressed by the intelligence of those involved in the development of the telescope so we can see what's beyond the reach of our human eyes.
Let's thank God for his creation. It took intelligent people to make the telescope, it took someone very intelligent to create such an awesome universe.",1409788800,,397,4.852941176470588
3814181,5,B001UW59JY,Great overview of different telescopes and some of the history they made.,1409356800,,73,5.166666666666667
3814182,5,B001UW59JY,"It was a great documentary; however, it did not cover a 400 year period.",1408838400,,72,4.214285714285714
3814243,4,B001UW59JY,Fun history of invention of the optical telescope.  Could have been just a bit better if the principles of optics were explained.,1408060800,,129,4.863636363636363

3814247,5,B001UW59JY,"This is such a great historical lesson about telescope. If you are into Astronomy like me, you will appreciate this dvd. Niel deGrassee Tyson as always did a great job narrating it.",1398556800,,181,4.6875
3814248,5,B001UW59JY,Who doesn't like Neil Tyson? This is in depth- but gives the background of the development of the technology in telescopes.,1397433600,,123,4.904761904761905
3814249,4,B001UW59JY,I use this in my college-level astronomy classes for both content and to spark in-class debate. Nice resource to have.,1393977600,,118,4.95
3814250,5,B001UW59JY,"This video was excellent in the program &
video animation to explain the history & usage of telescopes in exploring space.",1391990400,,122,4.857142857142857
3814251,5,B001UW59JY,I was expecting more on the development of amateur commercial scopes.  The main focus of this is large Observatory based telescopes.,1391040000,,132,5.285714285714286
3814252,4,B001UW59JY,"A well done review of the history and development of ""the telescope"". So many telescopes and so little time: it was constrained by being limited to two hours. I would love to see a more detailed explanation of each of the telescopes' development and why each worked as well as they did/do for their time. It's a 5-star program but I wanted more, hence my 4-star rating.",1380240000,,369,4.522388059701493
8345279,5,B001UW59JY,"Well done elementary discussion & history.  Now there are about 10 times as many exoplanets known as said in this.  And Marcy has been an early harassment-accused celebrity.  Success and Failure, but still a good doc.",1510272000,,217,4.972222222222222
8345280,5,B001UW59JY,"Although I DON'T CARE for Neil D. Tyson, I did like this programme.",1508803200,,67,4.230769230769231
8345281,5,B001UW59JY,"Goes really well with the 3 set Privileged Planet, Unlocking the mystery of life, case for a creator. It is also very good as just seeing where science has come in viewing the universe.",1489708800,,185,4.470588235294118
8345282,5,B001UW59JY,I purchased this video to use with my middle school science class.  It was very good and I found a worksheet to use with it online.,1485129600,,131,4.038461538461538
8345283,5,B001UW59JY,My professor was in it,1477180800,,22,3.6
8345284,3,B001UW59JY,It was a bit more technical than I expected. I work with middle schoolers and a recent National Geographic movie on the Milky Way presented the history of the telescope in a more entertaining but detailed manner.,1461542400,,212,4.756756756756757
8345285,4,B001UW59JY,"Given the price of this disk, I expected it to have several more hours of program on it.  The quality of the one Nova TV hour was good, well up to the Nova show standard.  But I was expecting 3 hours or so, not just 60 minutes.",1458259200,,227,3.8085106382978724
8345286,4,B001UW59JY,"Great overview of the telescope, the one tool modern astronomy relies upon more than anything else.  I like how it touches upon the social context of Copernicus and Galileo, without getting bogged down into the details, as they really are a subject of their own.",1436054400,,262,4.822222222222222
