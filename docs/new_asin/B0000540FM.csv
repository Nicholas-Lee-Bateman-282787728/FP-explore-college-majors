7930570,5,B0000540FM,"With Piccolo fighting Android 17, Cell shows up to the battlefield to claim his prize. And now, it becomes a brief chance to survive. With Cell's power at his max, Piccolo doesn't stand a chance. By proving that, he blasted Piccolo through his stomach so that Piccolo could be out of the way permanantly. With 17 battered and bruised, he could not stop Cell and his awesome power. With 17 almost absorbed, Android 16, the silent warrior steps in and takes Cell on. With power like a bull, it appears that 16 was the last hope of the Androids surviving. With a sneak attack, Cell manages to absorb 17 and moves a step closer to perfection. With Cell at his second stage, 16 cannot match up with the powerful android. With that in mind, Tien goes all out and prevents Cell from reaching his goal. But can Tien put a stop to Cell or will he lose his life? wCan Vegeta and Trunks make it out in time to save Tien? Find out later on in the Perfect Cell Saga!!!!",1055462400,,956,4.316666666666666
