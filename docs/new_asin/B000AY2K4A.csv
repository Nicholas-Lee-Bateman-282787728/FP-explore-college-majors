8080337,5,B000AY2K4A,"First the libretto.

There is little to say about the libretto of this opera adapted from the eponymous play by William Shakespeare. Their adaptation is essentially a shortening of the text but it is mostly a text that comes directly from Shakespeares play, hence in Shakespeares language which is poetical, musical and extremely rich, in the case of this comedy, in humor, even satire of both society and the practices or customs of the dramatic stage in Shakespeares time. The social criticism can be just implied though not directly expressed. It is the case of marriage practices. For both the wealthy and the powerful marriage was a family business: the father authorized, hence gave consent, to a marriage if it fitted his economic or social interests, particularly his influence and power.

This compulsory consent up to the age of twenty-one in a time when life expectancy was twenty nine years, was duly enforced with a minimum age for the marriage of girl in Shakespeares time between ten and thirteen with only one obligation: consent from the father, a parent, the guardian or some official if the previous ones were absent. In the play the law that is criticized is Athenian and the father can require death for a daughter who refuses to marry the man this father has chosen, with for the Duke of Athens the possibility to commute this death penalty into a life imprisonment in the temple of some goddess that will impose celibacy and virginity.

It is well understood that economically the men and the women are from the same social condition, meaning wealthy. Thats the part Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears cut off, hence the whole beginning of Shakespeares play. There will only be some allusions to it, especially at the end but it will have little value since the young people have solved their own problem with a little help from their friends the fairies. This choice is wise since such a situation does not speak to us any more except when we are considering the practice of forced marriages in some foreign civilizations and within the context of some religions in the world, particularly in the Moslem world.

The play starts in the forest and will stay in the forest till the second and last scene of the third act. This is also a wise choice because it makes the play even lighter than in Shakespeares version. It becomes a real entertainment that could be seen as a masque or even a pantomime due to the fairies and magic. Puck, Oberon and Titania are all beings of the underworld, which used to be a difficult subject in Elizabethan times, but which is today banal and common place though generally in childrens literature. Harry Potter is today a master in the field but he is not alone. Some may say that Harry Potter is not really for children but rather for young adults. Lets say some people are precautious and we can consider a fifteen year old person either an older child or a younger person, not yet an adult but not far from it. The text of the libretto is very systematically ambiguous between a sexy reading or just a farcical reading. Of course as soon as it is set to a stage some choices are necessary that make this ambiguity either a pun-like discourse, playing on words, or a choice towards one interpretation. Thats why we can hesitate in front of this libretto: is it a childrens piece of literature and entertainment, or is it a farce based on innuendo, ambiguous meanings and erotic situations and language. Thats the main merit of this libretto. It really let the conductor and director free to go one way or the other.

One thing is sure in the libretto. Since most of the opera takes place in the underworld, in a forest, during one night, the midsummer night, Saint Johns day and night, with celebrations generally around or on the Summer solstice, a festive period in the fertile and happy direction, we can consider we are in foreign territory and thus we, the audience, are the foreigners. But in this foreign territory we have four young people, two women and two men, who are spending the night there more or less by accident and who are going to be the victims of tricks, pranks and mistakes from Puck and Oberon. These four are the first group of foreigners, or strangers. The second group counts six artisans, craftsmen or tradesmen from Athens who are preparing a play for the Dukes marriage. They will also be the victims, particularly Bottom who is bottomless or without any bottom, who is turned into an ass, meaning a donkey, but also a synonym of bottom, to satisfy Oberons revenge on Titania who has estranged him from her bed because she refuses to yield a young infant or child she has recuperated from some Indian queen, hence in Shakespeares time, a child that would be assumed to be a gypsy child. The six tradesmen are foreigners or strangers in the forest, but the infant who is at stake between Oberon and Titania is a real foreigner both in fairyland and in Athens, in human land.

But in Shakespeares time fairies and fairyland would have been seen, understood and even by some resented as some strange and foreign underworld not to be mentioned. This dimension disappears in modern times and Benjamin Britten and his partner Peter Pears (who sang the part of Lysander, one of the two young men lost in the forest) play on this fairyland as an estrangement for the audience and the last scene brings the audience back to earth with yet another estrangement with the play in the play that brings on the stage a lion, talking mind you, the moon, also talking and a wall that has a lot to say. Estrangement inside the bringing back of the audience from a long and previous estrangement of another sort, more magical. The whole play works because of these dimensions and the opera here amplifies this aspect by cutting off the opening part in the Dukes palace in Athens.

In other words, a good libretto for a modern opera that can be read in many different ways.

Second the opera and the music.

From the very start we know we are going to be in an innovative approach. No realism at all. The setting is a vast inclined green surface cattycorner on the stage in the shape of a vast bed with two enormous pillows on the left. Green like the forest, a bed like sleeping and dreaming and a vast surface that enables the actors, and they are going to be actors, to do all their antics unrestrained.

The fairies are all boys and of course trebles. They are dressed in a very particular way, all of them the same: some kind of grayish and greenish hair, a greenish mustache, a green long tail tuxedo, blue pants and red gloves. They act in various ways but always organized in a clear fashion, a line or several lines, or groups, etc. They are twenty and can divide in groups of four or five easily.

The surprise comes with Puck who is a lot older than the other fairies. The producer wanted an actor able to be very expressive in body language and he is. He also has to be acrobatic because of the type of action he takes. He is only walking on his two feet but when he is supposed to disappear he runs to the top left corner of the inclined surface and just jumps or dives in a way or another behind the green surface. That makes him natural and in no way laughable. He is the basic empathetic character who reverberates in his action and expression, face, language and body, the emotions he may feel and the people he is dealing with are feeling. He is like a grotesque mirror of the characters. In spite of the surprise due to his age, we very fast get acquainted to him and he becomes natural. He will end more or less attached to the big red curtain at the end as if he were climbing on that curtain like a cat or something.

The colors of the fairies are of course symbolical of the fairyland they live in; Oberon is dressed in green, Titania in blue and the Indian child, who is of course not a real child since it is only a prop in this production, is red. This touch of red in an essentially green and blue world is quite striking and it is perfect for the disturbing third element that the Indian baby is.

Thats when the human characters come in and they are systematically going to be dressed in one color essentially, some creamy white in-between pearl and vanilla custard. In other words they are going to stick out like so many sore thumbs. These are the noble or wealthy people. The craftsmen or tradesmen are dressed more casually but mostly in the brown range. For the play in the play they will be dressed in some funny ancient way like Romans with togas of various shapes and length and all in some whitish light material.

The first act then is just played on this green surface and the big pillows can be uncovered from the green sheet covering the vast surface and the landscape becomes a real giant bed in which some can go to sleep. The two couples have many props representing their travelling: an umbrella that can become a weapon, a hat box that can contains other props, etc. The actors are dropping them everywhere and using them defensively, aggressively, or whatever, but they always pick them up at the end of each sequence. Do not litter please. Very English.

Note that Oberon, when Titania is asleep in the big green bed with her Indian child, steals the baby once and for all which will justify what he will say later that he has the child and thus can play round, have his revenge, etc

The second act will still use the vast green inclined surface for the forest, entirely covered by the green sheet and the two big pillows have gone. But seven beds have been installed in some kind of geometrical order, four in the front and three in the back. The very disposition of these green beds is fascinating. The whole action is happening in these beds and on these beds. Titania and her ass paramour are going from one bed to the next to finally end up in one bed at the back. The game played by these two is deeply visually obscene with an extremely well endowed Bottom-ass and the fairies who are supposed to scratch the asss head and back are acting like disgusted children who do it because they have been ordered to do it but not with any kind of willingness and enthusiasm. They despise this ass whose head they have to scratch. One even puts dark plastic surgical gloves on to do it.

The human couples are finally brought in and they are guided by Puck to the four front beds in proper order, alternating the men and the women and preparing the re-union of the expected lovers and couples, Hermia next to Lysander, Helena next to Demetrius. Since they have been fighting in the forest and had already been soiled with green stains on their clothes and props, they reappear to be put to bed in their body clothing vastly tainted with green and in tatters.

At the end of the second act we thus have the four humans in the front beds and in the three back beds from let to right we have Puck, all the fairies piled up on the middle bed and Titania and her ass in the bed on the right.

The third act is still in the forest for the first scene which is the awakening of the three sleeping couples and the end of Oberons revenge. A big frontal red curtain had been dropped in front of the setting to enable the changes in the disposition of beds and actors. The inclined surface is all green and there are only three beds suspended in mid air. From left to right, first the two human couples reunified and then on the right Titania and her ass.

The action, starts with Oberon and Titania. Her bed is brought down and Oberon gets even with her. He is carrying the baby and will drag it on the floor at the end of the scene like and as the prop it is. Then the two human couples will come down and strangely enough their tattered body clothing has been transformed in clean white undergarments, both men and women.

After Bottoms flashback on when he was an ass, the fairies make the three beds very neatly, five fairies per bed and the beds dragging up the whole green sheet of the ground go up and away into the sky. The stage is now still an inclined surface but white and the last scene at the Dukes palace can take place. First the three married couples and then the play in the play. This last moment in the opera is essential since it is a farce and it mocks romantic passion and is supposed to make its audience laugh at the silly performance. The actors come on stage in their underwear and they will drape themselves in white sheets of various sizes. The wall has a chink but it is not between two fingers. The director made the wall vast by draping a sheet over long sticks held by the actor, on both sides with the pattern of stones and the chink is a black hole positioned in a provocative and obscene place both front and back right in the middle of the actor carrying that wall. It is farcical of course and funny. The acting is perfect in that line and the bergomask is transformed into a general dance for all the people on the stage including the nobles and the wealthy.

That leads us to midnight and the three couples of lovers are sent to bed by the Duke. The fairies and Puck take over, the fairies marching in from left to right in five lines, five, then five, then four, then four and finally two in front right: this geometrical order is interesting because it emphasizes the slanting ground on which they operate. Puck comes in with his broom to clean up and the twenty fairies bring in Oberon and Titania. Five fairies on each side of Oberon and Titania, hence twenty in four groups. The reconciliation is complete and Puck can climb on the curtain to give us his final epilogue.

This is exactly what we expect from this opera. The music is extremely dynamic and varied in tone and tempo and it sounds as if at times it became hysterical, super dense and dynamic accompanying the action perfectly. You will also recognize some groups of notes now and then because quite a few allusions to existing musical melodies or tunes are used by Britten. It is never a full sentence but just a few notes sounding like some tunes you know.

This is in full agreement with the strange ternary ending of the three married couples that is evened by a fourth couple re-united at last. Three meaning disruption, Shakespeare could not end on such a situation and this disruptive ending is softened and sweetened into some equilibrium by the fourth couple. Shakespeare used that pattern in As You Like It but this time with four couples getting married under the supervision and blessing of the god of marriage, Hymen. We also have to see that this production emphasizes the ternary pattern in the forest in the first scene of the third act with three beds for the three couples. Once again it could not be the end because of the disruptive nature of this ternary pattern. But it is a good thing the stage direction and setting put that ternary figure forward.

In other words and to conclude let me say this production is what we can today expect from such an opera: a very visual and abstract vision, a dream in other words that is built on simple symbolism based on Shakespeares style and architecture. The vision has to be pure patterns that become significant by their constant presence with the contradiction between the ternary and the quaternary figures. This is amplified by other elements like colors or the actors of the play in the play who are six for sure, one playing director and the others acting, the couple of lovers being trapped by three farcical elements, the moon (itself ternary: the man, the bush and the dog in the moon), the lion and the wall, absolute confusion and disorder that will cause the dramatic death of both lovers in the famous Romeo and Juliet way. The director of the play, Peter Quine is of course the balancing element but the balancing is based on six characters, three humans and three animal or props. We can of course see in this pattern a common trait of anti-Semitism which was very standard in Shakespeares time though Shakespeare very often made it light or not too dramatic with the two exceptions of Titus Andronicus and Othello.

Finally this production clearly makes humans foreigners and strangers in the forest by being in the creamy color range against the green, blue and red surrounding colors. And vice versa for the fairies in the Dukes palace. The tradesmen are the strangers or foreigners or outsiders in both the forest and the Dukes palace, being brownish in the forest and plain white in the Dukes palace. These colors are emphasized by the styles of the clothes of the characters. We thus have three worlds that are foreigners, strangers and outsiders to one another in the various locales in the opera.

8080338,3,B000AY2K4A,"If someone is curious about Britten and what he might have done with this beloved tale, I think it only fair to warn them that if they are fond of the romantic era in music they may be quite unhappy with this production. I have heard some Britten compositions, by our local symphony, and thought it was marvelous. But this?..it may be best to quote the person who said once that ""You know it was a good opera when you emerge humming the memorable melodic wonder that continually unfolded like flowers in time lapse photography""..well actually I worded it that way. This is NOt that kind of composing. For me it meandered, wandered aimlessly, seeming to my ears, non stop recitiative, the cross between singign and talkign that is, frankly, what people new to opera complain about, asking : "" is it music yet?""...""no, they are just laying out the storyline""...and the set all the other reviewers find 'mahvelous""...i detested. The moon you see on the cover is something to merely cause the deer in the headlights effect....I am sorry to annoy the other reviewers...I just don't think this deserves 5 stars at all. One here used the term ""minimalist set""...again and again in reviews of operas, the most common complaint of all regards the minimalist set. It's just cheap, chinzy, miserly..""this is all we've got so just go with it""..I don't think it inspires good performance. it's just bilious and garish. I am classic artist and supported myself with art my entire adult life with my art...i think I am qualified to  criticise this work.",1381622400,,1538,4.7819548872180455
8080339,5,B000AY2K4A,"I never miss a Robert Carsen production, as this director is unfailingly imaginative yet always faithful to
the work. The set is basically just one big bed--because there is so much sleeping in the piece--but there
is lots to enjoy visually. The cast is quite good, though I have to say I didn't like the Puck, whose comic
""caperings"" were too forced. He's also played as a full-grown man, whereas Britten wanted an acrobatic youngster.
The fairies, a chorus of adolescents, are all perfect little gentlemen with quaint green moustaches; their
scorn for Bottom is very funny. This DVD set is ideal for not only opera lovers but Shakespeareans as well.",1346889600,,651,4.873873873873874
8080340,5,B000AY2K4A,"Other reviewers have described this production well, so I'll just highlight my impressions. I recently wrote a 25-page paper on this opera, and I found that this production in every way fulfilled my hopes. It is simultaneously faithful to Britten and Shakespeare, and creative with metaphor, staging, and acting.

First, I was very struck by the set design, which was minimalistic but highly effective. The first act features the stage covered in green cloth, with two white bed-sized cushions on the side. As a result the entire stage is a gigantic bed. This highlights the dual themes of sexuality and dreaming. The lighting is simple - green, blue, and white. Green and blue are for the fairies, with green belonging to Oberon primarily and blue to Tytania. In the third act, which is partly set in the human court, the stage is white -- for the humans. All through,the humans are dressed in white with white lighting, but as their quarrel in the wood progresses and they come under the influence of Oberon's fairy magic, they are progressively more soiled with green and cast in green and blue lights. That is only one example of highly metaphorical, effective, and simple set design and costuming.

Staging is similarly well done. One reviewer says that the sexual tensions are highlighted. It is done well, taking into account that the story begs the need for the characters to be physical. My tastes are generally conservative, but for adults it is clear that this is stage kissing. By some interpretations, Oberon could be portrayed as having diverse sexual interests-- why exactly does he want the changeling boy? But my interpretation (and most standard interpretations of the Shakespeare) is that the child is a pawn in the tug-of-war between Oberon and Tytania. Theirs is a marital power conflict. I appreciated that David Daniel's performance did not try to read extraneous sexual interests into the character of Oberon. He is a serene and distant Oberon, truly in a different world from the humans. As could be expected, his singing was magnificent and the magic of his voice must have been amazing in the live performance.

I could mention each of the singers with praise, but for the length of the review let me say that they fulfill the highest expectations! The lovers interact with the right balance of passion and insanity, the Fairies with a Baroque grace, and the rustics with a bumbling repartee that is so finely-tuned that it perfectly illuminates Britten's work.",1259452800,9,2488,4.947368421052632
8080341,5,B000AY2K4A,"This is a beautiful and charming performance from each and every point of view.

The pervious reviewer remark about this not being the entire opera is nonsense.

This is the entire Britten opera, but Britten did not compose the first act of the Shakespeare play, and his enchanting opera opens in the magic wood...

Highly recommended!",1233273600,2,335,4.946428571428571
8080342,5,B000AY2K4A,"The DVD arrived from Amazon promptly and in pristine condition.  I also appreciate the simple, easily recycled packaging.  Thanks.",1219968000,2,130,5.7894736842105265
8080343,5,B000AY2K4A,"Truly one of the most beguiling of Benjamin Britten's operas, his 1960 adaptation (with longtime partner and co-librettist Peter Pears) of Shakespeare's fanciful comedy, ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"", was given a highly original makeover in Canadian music director Robert Carsen's production at the 1995 Festival of Aix-en-Provence. With some surprising cinematic touches added by film director Francois Roussillon, the production has been faithfully reworked in this wonderful April 2005 staging at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona. Virgin Classics has done a superb job in capturing the magic of this performance, which hopefully signals a trend toward even more such DVD packages.

Highlighting the sexual tensions of the original play on a minimalist, blue-green-dominated set, Carsen foregoes period costumes to focus on the essence of the various themes by retaining the humor while still evoking a constant aura of mystery in his translation. Anyone familiar with the play knows that Shakespeare saturated his text with twisting ironies among a diverse set of characters, and Britten creatively responds with a unique musical style for each group - the folk-like pastiche of brass for the rustic characters (i.e. the ""mechanicals""); the more noble sounds of strings and woodwinds which reflect Britten's more recognized style for the lovers; and the ethereal blend of percussion, harpsichord and harps full of glissandi for the immortals. These distinctions lend musical shadings that create the ideal panorama of emotions and comic elements to pull off Shakespeare's tale.

The international cast is superb and given the multiple nationalities represented, surprisingly compatible. The ensemble starts with the extraordinary American countertenor David Daniels as the fairy king, Oberon. In a relatively understated performance despite his resplendent green attire and matching green hair, he commands the stage with the right mix of unbridled romanticism and searing malevolence. Indicative of the part as originated by Alfred Dellar, the lower register of his voice is used splendidly, especially on his key Act I number, ""I know a bank where the wild thyme blows"". Even though he is known far more as a Handelian, Daniels's obvious affinity for Purcell (as evidenced on his recital discs, ""Serenade"" and ""A Quiet Thing"") serves him well here. Spanish soprano Ofelia Sala offers a full-bodied Tytania with a lovely voice that encompasses the coloratura of the role and a comic deftness to move fluidly from impervious to smitten as Bottom's unintended paramour. A high point is her delightful version of Act II's ""Be kind and courteous to this gentleman"".

As the first pair of lovers, Lysander and Hermia, Canadian tenor Gordon Gietz and American mezzo-soprano Deanne Meek exude passion effortlessly, sing beautifully together and provide the grounding necessary for their later comic scenes. German soprano Brigitte Hahn and with an especially dark timbre, English baritone William Dazeley, appear as the more comical second pair, Helena and Demetrius. The dynamic interaction of these four, whether quarreling or fleeing from each other due to Puck's intrusive magic, produces an engaging romp, all the while making Britten's music vibrant with emotional fervor and clear diction. English veterans from the 2004 Glyndebourne production fill the remaining principal roles. Bass-baritone Peter Rose makes a fine, subtle Bottom with a strong voice. Managing to remain expressive even in a full-head donkey mask, he lends an endearing quality and makes the most of his recital of his dream of love with Tytania. Proving a boisterous band, the mechanicals work well as an ensemble with tenor Christopher Gillett an appropriately naive Flute and bass Henry Waddington a lively albeit controlling Quince.

In the speaking role of Puck, the physically antic Emil Wolk is not the young figure one generally envisions in the role but a mischievous, middle-aged sprite who plays with the rhythms of Shakespeare's prose a little too freely (the cadences feel somewhat off). Costumed as green-hued gentleman's gentlemen with mustaches, the chorus of fairies is played liltingly by the Escolania de Montserrat under choirmaster Joaquim Pique. Michael Levine's strikingly bare but highly dramatic-looking set consists of a deep blue backdrop with just a crescent moon and most of the stage taken by a large platform laid out as a huge bed covered with a green bedspread. Two huge pillows are revealed underneath the bedcovers, and they become multi-purposed as river banks for the lovers to set themselves and as Tytania's bed at the end of Act I.

The bed theme remains constant throughout the opera with, for example, three beds suspended dramatically in mid-air, two containing the pairs of lovers and one containing Tytania and Bottom. They ascend and descend depending on the plot turns. Lighting is also used dramatically, especially in the Act II entrance of Oberon and Puck. This is a visual as well as aural treat, and under Harry Bicket's expert baton, the Symphony Orchestra of the Gran Theatre del Liceu performs the music with dazzling dexterity and disciplined pacing. The 160-minute opera is presented on two discs with Acts I and II on the first and Act III on the second, and the package also includes a small pamphlet with credits, color photos and scene titles. Subtitles are available, though the credits in the recording itself are strictly in French.",1138752000,46,5474,5.35307781649245
