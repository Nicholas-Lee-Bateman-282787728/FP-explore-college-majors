5931025,2,B00EOMJ9W0,"Beautiful photography and music.  Story - unless you're really into 'depressing', then not so much.  Buy the CD instead.",1434672000,,120,5.2631578947368425
5931026,5,B00EOMJ9W0,One of my favorite movies.  Looks great in blu ray,1424563200,,50,4.0

5931028,5,B00EOMJ9W0,"This film looks great on blu-ray (remastered though some dust still remains on print), and comes with an eight page booklet with articles about the movie and the history behind the story of the viol. There is also a making of featurette and interviews with Alain Corneau, Jean-Pierre Marielle and Jordi Savall. Well worth the upgrade from dvd.",1409270400,3,343,4.931034482758621
5931029,4,B00EOMJ9W0,"This is a movie you really must focus your attention on or you will quickly get lost.
  It is brilliantly done with great acting, costumes, and cinematography.
  Guillaume Depardieu was a handsome chip off his father and showed his potential to perhaps eclipse is father.",1407024000,2,271,4.955555555555556
5931030,3,B00EOMJ9W0,"Like ""Chicken With Plums"" this film dealt with a part of life which I never have had any empathy for.  How a person can be so involved with music to he point of putting it above all else is beyond my understanding.",1389398400,,214,4.095238095238095
5931031,5,B00EOMJ9W0,"It's another satisfying summer in France with Depardieu. I promise... if you like classical music, or France, ...or life, you will love this. None of my reviews apply to Americans who ""don't like words"" on the screen. It's one of my all time favorites. I'm always happy to replace dvd's with blu-ray, because the old dvd is a grand gift. -Well, I only buy fantastic discs. Amazon reviews are always helpful to me, along with the usual review sites. This Blu-ray is great.",1387756800,10,471,4.686746987951807
5931032,5,B00EOMJ9W0,"The French are brilliant at these off-beat dramas that merge the sublime, the magical and an almost mandatory touch of vulgarity! This is such a beautiful film and should be seen by anyone with an interest in music. The transfer to Blu-ray is an improvement on the DVD but both claim to be remastered and digitally restored and it is evident no further restoration has taken place over the DVD. The colour tends towards the blue in places and the skin tones are slightly over pink. These are obviously source related issues and no attempt has been made on the Blu-ray to make any corrections over the DVD. The overall picture is however much sharper and the English subtitles are white not over-large yellow as on the DVD. My only issue is with the extras where a hugely improved interview item is added but the marvellous doco on the amazing Jordi Savall dropped. This is a serious loss and if you have the DVD you may care to keep disc two or obtain a copy of this fascinating 49 minute film. Overall the main film is a decent upgrade and some cheap offers are available if one looks. The music is to die for! For Europeans / Australians note this is A locked.",1385510400,16,1162,4.460093896713615
8607454,5,B00EOMJ9W0,"So believably authentic-looking, I felt as if I could smell the manor's dankness and feel its green grass under my bare feet.  To watch this gorgeous film, listen to its beautiful soundtrack, and follow its captivating, but at times, very melancholic story performed by an excellent cast, is an undeniably moving experience. In perfectly-set screen compositions, nearly every bucolic scene, and those with characters in period costumes, from plain sensible clothing in a vegetable garden, to colorful, ribbon-trimmed satin and tights worn by peri-wigged musicians in court, could be a gilt-framed old master painting.

Seeing a fresh-faced handsome Guillaume Depardieu as young Marais is somewhat sad, knowing that he passed away ten or so years after this film, from injury complications after a motorcycle accident.  He looked the part of Marin Marais, and portrayed him so well.  And, of course, not surprisingly, his father Gerard gave a well-done and convincing portrayal of a much older Marais.  This is the first time I've seen a film with Jean-Pierre Marielle, who played the terribly stern and intimidating Sainte Colombe.  Such a fine actor.  Because of his impressive performance, you MUST watch the excellent bonus interviews, and the brief spot on Marielle.

One of the most dream-like, artistic films I've ever seen.  Lovely to the eye, and lovely to the ear, Tous les Matins du Monde is hypnotically ravishing.",1513814400,,1425,5.269911504424779
