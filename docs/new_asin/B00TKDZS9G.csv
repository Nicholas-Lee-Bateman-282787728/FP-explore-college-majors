7011835,5,B00TKDZS9G,"These live action videos are amazing!  They nailed it!  My family and I thought they were as good or better than the animated series.  The casting, the storyline (even the few changes), the actions scenes, the scenery ALL fantastic.",1428883200,4,232,4.897435897435898

7011838,4,B00TKDZS9G,"Great movie, although it doesn't quite live up to the quality of the other two movies. Aoshi seemed to be completely shoehorned into the movies and it REALLY shows in this one.

Other than that one major gripe, this is a fantastic movie and a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Well worth the buy.",1427587200,3,295,4.673076923076923
7011839,1,B00TKDZS9G,The regional code does not work in America. This is the second DVD I've purchased where the regional code is unknown. You're better off downloading the movie or finding an uploaded version online instead of wasting your money. I recommend watching this series via Gooddrama or Vimeo.,1425772800,2,283,5.042553191489362

8702110,1,B00TKDZS9G,"As a long time fan of the manga, I must say this movie captures the feel of Kenshin.  This actor embodies the spirit of the
beloved wandering rurouni and brings the Kenshin we expect to the live screen .  Some allowances are made to squeeze in other characters but
since this was a three movie series spanning years of manga, the results are credible.",1465603200,,351,4.46875

8702115,5,B00TKDZS9G,Not too shabby. They did a good job transferring a couple seasons of an anime into a 2-hour movie (three total). Characters were spot on. It brought me back to my youth.,1435017600,2,169,4.3125
