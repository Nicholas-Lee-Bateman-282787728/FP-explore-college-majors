8055088,5,B00080ZH14,"It's an account of two young Afghans' flight to London from the futureless and featureless aridity of a refugee camp. The story of their costly, difficult and and at one stage tragic journey, sent on trucks, buses, old pickups, carts, or creeping through bitter cold and snow in the mountains to avoid patrols as they enter Turkey, was based on interviews with those who had made those journeys. Hope, fear, endurance, sadness...many emotions.

An excellent bonus on the DVD is the director's description of the very  realistic deals they and their local ""fixers"" had to make with border officials everywhere, to be able to film, and how then many of the officials and also the fixers got caught up in the process and were happy to play their real selves in the movie!

Much of the action and dialog was improvised and works really well. Also the visions of all the different countries they passed through and the people they met are stunning.  Well worth seeing.",1244419200,,963,4.783132530120482
