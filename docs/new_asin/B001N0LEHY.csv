8356570,5,B001N0LEHY,"I first saw this movie at the HotDocs Documentary Film Festival in Toronto, Canada, where it was an official selection. I remember how I was blown away by the originality and artistry of this film - both in the visuals and the sound! And, every time I`ve watched it since it never fails to leave a strong impression. It`s called an Experimental Documentary and it certainly is that! But always, at the film`s heart is the moving story of a man, his addictions, his relationships, and his spiritual journey. This is unlike anything I`ve seen (or heard) before, or since. Darryl Miller takes a very detailed and dynamic approach to both the visuals and the sound, with layers building to create a much greater whole than the sum of their parts (and the parts are very interesting in themselves). It all comes together to deliver a stunning, hypnotic, beautiful, terrifying, surreal, hyper-real, and impactful filmic trip-experience that will be spinning around in your head for a long time to come. A true work of art.",1362009600,2,1016,4.811428571428571
