2203415,5,B000777I56,"From trade throw in ""player to be named later"" to NLCS MVP.  Incredible journey by a great player.  He was doing it back in 2006 with the A's vs. the Twins in the ALDS and seeing him continue to perform in the NLCS is a truly inspirational story.  GO GIANTS!",1350950400,3,258,4.12
2203416,5,B000777I56,"This documentary follows one year in the life of a AAA baseball team. Early in the film a coach/manager type person says that of all the players who are drafted ultimately only something like 6% of them will ever - ever! even once! - play in the majors. That statement hangs in a corner of your brain for the duration of the film. You'll watch each of those guys and think how meager is the chance of them attaining their dream.

The player's wives are, to a degree, the stars of the show. Marco Scutaro's wife in particular is just a joy to watch. Not just because of her sunny personality, but also because of her grounded perspective - that they are ALREADY living the dream. They've come to America to play baseball, after all. Her grounded optimism and her fierce love for her husband are beautiful.

Of course, as a Red Sox fan who kicked things when they traded him to the Rockies, Scutaro is the one I came to watch. I loved seeing his different batting stance and hearing the numerous ways in which his last name was pronounced (if I ever meet that guy, that'll be the first question I ask him).",1330732800,3,1104,4.380487804878049
2203417,4,B000777I56,really nice to see an inner peek into baseball and the lives of those involved in it.  nice that the players and families allowed the cameras.  wish more could be like that but understandable why not.,1312070400,,200,4.527777777777778
2203418,5,B000777I56,"I think the most telling statement in the 85-minute documentary came early on when a Milwaukee Brewers' executive noted that only six percent of all players playing minor league ball ever get a taste of Major League Baseball.

That sort of set the tone for the rest of the documentary, which focuses on the Indianapolis Indians, the AAA farm club of the Brewers. It follows the team during the 2001 season. Specifically, we follow a handful of players and see the struggles they and - in most cases - their wives go through.

As far as I know, most of the guys never made it. I know of Marco Scutaro who now plays with the Boston Red Sox. He's a shortstop/utility guy who hails from Venezuela. His wife is beautiful and both are well-spoken for two people raised in a different language than English. Actually, all the players profiled are well-spoken. One is a Stanford grad.

We also meet Micah Franklin, Kyle Peterson, Brad Tyler and other players. One of them, who I believe is playing in Seattle as of 2009, is Allen ""Meat"" Levrault, a big pitcher

Some of the stories are kind of sad, like Peterson, who has arm problems and didn't play after the season shown here on the documentary. Brad Tyler and his wife, I think, were the most impressive people. Peterson, Tyler, Franklin and others are about at the end of their dreams and it's a shame. You feel for the people in this film. Baseball is a ""field of dreams,"" and for most, those dreams are never realized.

We also meet ""Miss Jackie,"" the number one fan of the Indianapolis team for 40 years, a woman who bakes cookies for the all the players.

All in all, anyone who loves baseball should enjoy this film.",1239321600,4,1668,4.524916943521594
2203419,4,B000777I56,"By now most baseball fans have heard of and belive they undersand the difficulties and hardships involved in playing minor league baseball.  But this movie makes a compelling case that it's tougher than we've been led to believe.  Two factors, the grand instability of a player's life coupled with a seemingly unfair system are the hub of this movie. A player bounces from a midwestern home with his family to a motel room in Mexico and back within a year; another player  finishes the season high-lightered in the movie with six homers in seven SWINGS and never gets a shot at the major leagues...the same player, by the way,  (which the movie fails to point out) who hit .324 in his one major league stint with the Cardinals a couple of years before the season in the movie.
  With 95% or more of minor leaguers never getting major league service
time, this movie does a fine job manifesting the love of the game that is the core of minor league baseball.",1189036800,,957,4.567251461988304
2203420,5,B000777I56,"A great companion film to ""Bull Durham"". Anyone who loves baseball and wants a fly on the wall perspective of real life drama in the minor leagues will love this film.

I don't want to reveal any spoilers, but one of the players struggling to make the Major Leagues during the 2001 minor league season documented in this film is now a cult hero and fan favorite with one of the San Francisco Bay Area major league teams.",1163289600,6,420,4.384615384615385
2203421,5,B000777I56,"One of the best documentaries I have ever seen.  It was brilliant and entertaining throughout, and you don't need to be a baseball fan to enjoy it.  The personal stories are so compelling, the characters are inspiring and the editorial comments are brilliantly witty.

8045427,5,B000777I56,"90 min. documentary that focuses on two outfielders, a pitcher, and a middle infielder of the 2001 Indianapolis Indians the AAA team of the Milwakaukee Brewers.  The 2000 team won the AAA World Series.  This documentary follows the players from Spring Training to their season in Indy with injuries, family relationships, promotions to the Majors and reassignments to the minors.

To hear the wives speak is at some times heart-breaking as they have to follow their husbands around and endure their injuries with them.  When the players struggle they have to come up with a reason/excuse to explain their lack of production and/or they get replaced.

8045433,4,B000777I56,"WARNING: SPOILER ALERT
Definitely baseball's version of that classic basketball documentary.  Although not a perfect analog--the players in HD were younger and these baseball players are one step away from the Majors--the quixotic pursuit of that elusive, oft-times unrealistic dream is a common thread between the two movies. Most of these players never make it to the Majors, and of those who do, few stick.  Particularly heartbreaking are the players in their late-20s and 30s who are having trouble facing the reality that it's time to move on.  There is the player who gets released not long after building a house, and the power hitter who can no longer get around on a major-league fastball, or the first-round pitching prospect who never quite makes it back from shoulder surgery.  And then there is Marco Scutaro--why else would I have chosen this moment to watch this classic?--who is in the early stages of his journey to Major League playoff stardom.  Even for this future post-season MVP, the path to the Major Leagues is uncertain making the viewer wonder whether the sacrifices of being a man playing a little boys' game is worth it. Unfortunately, I fear that the answer in my case is that if I had had the talent, I would have milked it for as long as they'd let me.

Truly heartwarming and bittersweet.  I highly recommend it.",1351036800,,1344,4.842794759825328
