2025214,5,B0001US8EE,"No longer will I have to deal with the so-so quality of my vhs tapes.  Imo, this is the best season of Curb.  The following is the episode chronology:
1. The Car Salesman
2. Thor
3. Trick or Treat
4. The Shrimp Incident
5. The Thong
6. The Acupuncturist
7. The Doll
8. Shaq
9. The Baptism
10. The Massage
Except for a fairly amusing turn by Ed Asner, episode 6 is the only one that doesn't quite measure up.  I sure hope there are more features than what is listed (which is nothing).",1079568000,3,484,4.127659574468085
2025215,5,B0001US8EE,"...For bringing us this amazing show!
It is somewhat similar to Seinfeld, but is way edgier and goes into much more embarrassing situations than Seinfeld ever did and thereby succeeds in delving into corners of the mind that everybody has, but that no one is particularly proud of and many people even deny.
I am going to pick up the DVD for season 2 the day it is released, and will then wait anxiously for seasons 3 and 4 to be released.",1079481600,4,439,4.365853658536586
2025216,5,B0001US8EE,"The first season of Curb Your Enthusiasm is hilarious, and as an HBOless college student, I can't wait until the second season comes out on DVD. Larry David has made a brilliant show, with improvisations that are unlike any you've ever seen, plots that are as ridiculous as Seinfeld (and just as funny). It's painful to watch sometimes, and you find yourself wishing the characters would choose different ways of approaching life, but it's because of their horrible life strategies that the show is so funny and so successful. What a riot.",1079222400,6,539,4.869565217391305
2025217,5,B0001US8EE,it goes without saying that curb your enthusiasm is one of the most cutting edge shows on television.  which makes it so hard to believe that almost all of the show is improvised on the spot.  larry david is a true genius. and cheryl hines is a real hottie.  anyone who enjoyed seinfeld will definately enjoy this show.,1079049600,6,319,4.4655172413793105
2025218,5,B0001US8EE,"Low budget production, but very entertaining. The characters lack the chemistry of Seinfeld but the humor is classic Seinfeld.",1491004800,,126,5.684210526315789

2025220,3,B0001US8EE,"While this series is entertaining, I just don't see what everyone is raving about. The character Larry David just makes this insane situations occur for no apparent reason - it's like he is psychotic. I know he's supposed to be socially inept, but this is more some form of Tourette's. Just weird. The plots are basically rehashes of every Seinfeld and Woody Allen movie one way or another. Even the music is reminiscent of Woody Allen. And in some cases, writer Larry David is directly ripping off Seinfeld writer Larry David.

And what's with the wife? Besides having access to $500 million, I don't see why this character would ever stay married to the Larry David character, much less wed him in the first place. If Larry David the writer is trying for some sort of bizarre Al and Peggy Bundy dynamic it isn't working. I keep waiting for her to either plan his murder or cheat on him, WHICH WOULD BE INTERESTING. As is, she's just some weird environmental activist gold digger.

That said, the baptism episode was actually unique and showed some real creativity, although the whole airport screw up was just long, unnecessary foreplay. ONE episode.

If Larry David actually took the time to do something original this could be a brilliant series. But, instead, it's the same old Jewish schtick seen a billion times before.",1490140800,,1326,4.781659388646288

2025222,5,B0001US8EE,"I was looking for something new to watch when I saw this on Amazon Streaming on my Roku.  I'd heard of it but had never seen it since I don't have HBO.  Normally I like older shows, and don't like shows with ""mature"" language however, it all works in this series.  In my opinion this is one of the funniest TV shows I've watched in a long time.  In fact since Amazon Streaming only has 3 seasons I've come here to buy the rest of them.  Larry David is brilliant and acts so naturally.  This is coming from someone that never really liked Seinfeld.  The rest of the cast is great too.  The language can get raunchy at times so I probably wouldn't let young kids watch this however, it is used appropriately so it doesn't bother me at all.  The writing is funny and intelligent. From what I've read it isn't a scripted show.  The actors are given an outline of what to say and do but a great deal of it is ad libbed by the actors. I'm really looking forward to seeing the rest of the seasons.",1487894400,,990,4.163157894736842

I am actually glad I didn't watch it when it was on HBO each week simply because they leave you hanging and the only way to really watch the show and enjoy it is watchiing back to back. I have got three more seasons to go however I love it! The show is well played out and basically for me it's a continuation of were Seinfeld left off. It probably would be even funnier if they had called it ""After Seinfeld.""  Something else I really enjoy about the show is that you really must watch every episode to understand the snarky comment or inside jokes from other episodes as they work them and play them inside the current episode.  Lastly my 15-year-old son reminds me of Larry David, yes I said it. Enjoy the show enjoy the series as much as I do.",1444176000,,921,4.221590909090909

Curb Your Enthusiasm's  Larry David's character actually demonstrates what may happen to a person that appears to have been dropped on their head as a baby.

How else could one explain such total unacceptable,  behavior, lacking etiquette in  social settings, missed cues, lacking sentiment when called for, lack of endearments, lack of  traditions; and  NOT a sociopath?

2027863,5,B0001US8EE,"I have been a Larry David fan since the early days of Seinfeld. I became even more enthusiastic when he began his own series -- and now it's almost certain I qualify as a member of the CYE cult following (if such a thing exists). I have watched all the CYE seasons so often I can voice-over the dialogue. I suppose, upon self-examination, the connection I have made with CYE and Larry David is one of personality flaws and the consequences. Larry's character flaws are my flaws in real life. As I watch his epic failures, and the often calloused judgmental reactions of, let's say, Cheryl's mom and dad, I passionately empathize. I am a professing Christian, but when I watch the overbearing and unforgiving nature of Cheryl's fundamentalist parents, it drives me close to the other side (see Season 2, Episode 9: The Baptism). And the irreverent political 'un'correctness? Don't get me started. Thank you, Amazon, for making a good laugh available at the click of a remote.",1439856000,,974,4.769230769230769

2028062,5,B0001US8EE,"If you're an adult who doesn't really care about how appropriate stuff is for kids, skip this paragraph. If you're a parent who cares, I advise you to read the following sentences: I don't understand the rating for most of the TV-MA episodes. I'd say that besides ""Thor,"" ""The Shrimp Incident,"" and maybe ""The Massage"" (just because of the massage scene), all of the episodes are okay for any mature 14-year-old to watch. They're mostly just rated that for language, which I've never really found an appropriate sole reason to rate a movie R or a TV episode TV-MA. Sexual content and violence are much more important than the number of F-bombs spoken. If you're a parent with a kid who really wants to see this show, allow him/her to get the first two seasons. And apparently Amazon has season eight listed as TV-14 so maybe that one's appropriate too. I don't know, I haven't seen it. Now on to the review part...

""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is one of the most acclaimed shows of the 2000s, and rightfully so. While the first season was refreshing because it was nice to be further reminded that sitcoms were still doing pretty well, this second season takes that and elevates it to an even higher level. The ensemble cast is better in this season. While Cheryl seemed like a minor character in the first season, her character has been developed a little more here and given more of a personality. I also like the addition of Wanda Sykes. She's not on-screen very often at all, but when she is, she's unsurprisingly hilarious. Season two also saw an increase in writing quality. The plots are usually quite unique and bizarre, allowing for more laughs. Take ""Thor,"" in which Larry is threatened by a 250-pound boxer after an unfortunate misunderstanding. Or ""Shaq,"" in which Larry trips Shaq at a basketball game.

2028145,5,B0001US8EE,"The second season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is even better than the first.  The main characters are the same, with Larry David playing himself, Jeff Garlin as Jeff Greene (Larry's agent), and Cheryl Hines as Cheryl David (Larry's wife). As with the first season the shows are unscripted, and they focus on a single character (Larry) as he manages to rub people the wrong way in almost every facet of his life, and yet still manages to remain sympathetic enough for the show to work..  I found the episodes in the second season to be less predictable than those in the first season.  In addition, the humor is drawn from many more diverse elements than in the first season.

There are ten episodes in the season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"".  As was done for some of the Seinfeld series, this season the show has a season long plot which is present in most of the episodes.  That premise is that Larry is trying to develop a series where the main character is an actor from a successful situation comedy and who is trying to distance themselves from their former role.  Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus each play themselves in this storyline.  Each episode also has its own storyline, which range from Larry trying his hand at being a car salesman to Larry accidentally tripping Shaquille O'Neal to his misunderstanding a Baptism for an attempted drowning, and more.

The only area where this collection falls short of season one would be in the area of special features.  Quite simply there aren't any included.  However, one doesn't buy a DVD for special features and the episodes of the second season of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" are gems.  The quality of the episodes is very high for the entire season.

2028149,4,B0001US8EE,"Every great TV show has a particularly great series where everything about the execution peaks and for Curb Your Enthusiasm it has to be this second series. The 'running' subplot of Larry trying to restart his TV career first with Jason Alexander and then with Julia Louis-Dreyfus playing themselves is a hilarious catalyst for all of the brilliant plotting in these eps. Curb already revolutionised the modern sit com with it's tightly plotted storylines, and who would've thought - all of the brilliant dialogue in this series is ad-libbed by the sensational cast (many of them standup comics or experienced comic actors). By shunning artificial studio sets in favour of real locations, it makes 'Friends' look like a Fisher Price commercial. The best thing about the show is the courageous presentation of Larry David as a weirdly sympathetic anti-hero. Why do we always go with him on these gut wrenching, doomed for failure hair-brained schemes? His self interest and miserly tendencies always get the better of him and like every good song that we already know the words to, we're happy to go on the same journey and see just how he manages to screw up his life this time. There is an episode in this series which for me, shines above all other Curb shows involving bottles of water, a bathroom without a lock and a doll's head. It is magnificently relentless and absolutely hysterical. I rank it with 'The Rat' episode  in Fawlty Towers as one of the funniest eps in sitcom history. If you like this show already, then buy this - it is as good as it gets. If you have a passing interest only, this is the best place to start. Enjoy!",1115942400,,1639,4.710801393728223

2028152,4,B0001US8EE,"There are two reasons I had never really watched CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM.  One, we don't get cable or HBO, and two, everything I heard about it was that Larry David was such a miserable, downer character.  While I think SEINFELD was some of the funniest stuff on television, I figured I didn't need to watch this glum guy who isn't really an actor starring in a TV show as ""himself.""

Well, finally, my 17 year old son dragged me in front of the TV to watch some of the DVDs he had borrowed.  I'm so GLAD he did!!

First of all, Larry David is far from a complete misanthrope.  Granted, he's got a naturally whiny voice, slouchy posture and a natural cynicism that comes with intelligence.  But he's actually a fairly warm guy.  Unlike Jerry and his gang, he actually mostly gets himself into trouble trying to do something NICE, not nasty.  A good example:  In one episode, he's at a party that he's clearly not terribly interested in.  He goes upstairs to find a restroom (cuz the lock downstairs doesn't work...that's a whole other subplot) and bumps into the young daughter of the family that owns the house.  He uses the restroom and then he actually takes a moment to speak with the young girl in a friendly and genuine manner.  He apparently feels for the fact that she's been made to be cooped up in her room while the adults chat and drink below.  He talks with her about her doll, and as the two interact, she asks Larry to cut the doll's  hair.  Not having children of his own and not knowing better, Larry does so, and actually seems to enjoy his time with the little girl.  Of course, five minutes later she's screaming and complaining to momma about the horrible man that cut the doll's hair!  It's a frustrating situation that gets funnier as Larry tries to solve it...but the catalyst for the whole thing stems from Larry David being nice.  Genuinely.

The show has lots of moments like this.  And it's greatly helped by the delightful Cheryl Hines who plays David's wife.  They have a palpable affection, but if feels like the affection of a couple that's been together for awhile.  They can clearly annoy each other, but always with affection underneath.  They understand each other's weaknesses, but never is the solidity of their relationship threatened.  It's a believably happy marriage.

The show is in a very improvisational style, not at all like carefully crafted dialogue on SEINFELD.  Yet the plots are neatly structured and the characters are rich.  The episodes are sprinkled with wonderful cameos and appearances by many recognizable character actors.  The show is pleasantly non-mean-spirited, and very funny.

In keeping with HBO shows, it can be fairly graphic in its language, so it's not for kids.  But the humor isn't much for kids either.  It's a grownup show for intelligent grown-ups, and I HIGHLY recommend it.  Thank goodness for DVDs so I can finally see this show!!",1106092800,18,2906,4.691089108910891

While season one was enjoyable season two raises the bar even higher.  In the second season there is a common theme that runs throughout the episodes.  Larry David tries to pitch a new TV show to variety of networks.  Season Two has many appearances by former Seinfeld stars Jason Alexander and Julia-Louis Dreyfus as they try to pitch the new show.

The writing and acting on this improved show are great.  I cannot wait for season three to come out on DVD in January.  More good news is that Larry David is working on a new season right now.  I recommend this show for anyone that is a big fan of Seinfeld.  I would also recommend Arrested Development and the UK's The Office.  These shows are creating the best comedy today.

2028180,5,B0001US8EE,"I have always been a huge fan of HBO television. However, Curb Your Enthusiasm was a show that I always stayed away from up until very recently. I have never seen a single episode of Seinfeld, and Curb Your Enthusiasm focuses around the co-creator of that show Larry David. I was worried that refrences to Seinfeld in the show would make things confusing for me. However, after hearing from a countless amount of people how great Curb Your Enthusiasm was, I decided to put my skepticism aside and give it a shot. Curb Your Enthusiasm has to be one of the funniest shows that I have ever seen in my life and despite the few references to Seinfeld, I was able to keep up with no problem. The show is set up in the form of a ""mockumentary"" to show Larry David's life after Seinfeld and how he spends his time in his daily life. The reason the show is so funny, is because they portray Larry David as a constant victim of circumstance. The brilliance of this show, is that each episode focuses on how Larry's bad luck effects him and others around him. The show is quite addicting because of the fact that each episode manages to come up with new and entertaining ways for Larry to make a fool out of himself.

The second season of Curb Your Enthusiasm somehow manages to be even funnier and more entertaining than the first season. A few episodes worth mentioning are - ""Thor"" in which Larry becomes obsessed with showing Cheryl how un-kinky he is, and after one of their neighbors takes his casual greeting the wrong way, his wife mistakenly concludes that Larry has an ass [...] ; ""Trick or Treat"" in which Larry experiences the ""trick"" side of Halloween when Larry refuses to give candy to two teenagers who are not wearing costumes; and the funniest episode out of the first two seasons ""The Doll"" that revolves around Larry trying to find a replacement doll for the daughter of an ABC executive.

Now I have only seen the first two seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm on DVD. But the second season manages to become funnier and more entertaining. Overall, after watching the first two seasons of the show, I can honestly say that it offers some of the best writing I have ever seen, and it is one of the funniest shows ever. Despite the lack of extras, and that there is only ten episodes once again, the second season of Curb Your Enthusiasm is definately worth owning on DVD. All I can say is that I am highly anticipating the third season.

A solid 5 stars...",1101513600,2,2460,4.474387527839643
2028181,5,B0001US8EE,"Since the Seinfeld show is gone this is the next best thing. When you watch this stuff you get a whole new appreciation for the Seinfeld show. This stuff really hammers home that a lot of the funnier bits on The Seinfeld show were probably actual events in Larry David's life. Also, the next time you watch a Seinfeld episode you can start to detect Larry David's influences all over the show. The little terms like 'master of your domain', 'the snub', and ideas like the 'calzone' are all David ideas. Also, this may be a big stretch for some and I'm probably the only reviewer on Amazon that feels this way, but there's something very Woody Allen about this guy. (...). There's also a lot of whiny 'whaddya mean' situations that harken back to many Woody Allen dialogues. This is a good thing, because Woody hasn't  really been able to come up with a good movie for a while and this sort of fills in the space for me.",1096675200,,919,4.405882352941177
2028182,4,B0001US8EE,"I liked Seinfeld, but C.Y.E. is without question great television/cable.  When the first season started, I felt like I was the only person watching the show.  None of my family or friends could understand why I liked the show so much.  I realized that it's not for everyone, especially if you're the type that likes slapstick comedy.  Not every episode is fall out your chair funny, but you will enjoy watching the antics of Larry David.",1095292800,3,437,4.7105263157894735
2028183,5,B0001US8EE,"The show I had been waiting for without even knowing it. Larry David acts so put-upon all the time, but he doesn't have any real problems. I like the structure of the show.

Season two is my favorite season of HBO's superior  series: Curb Your Enthusiasm.",1094947200,,255,4.521739130434782
2028184,4,B0001US8EE,"Larry David retreads not only the Seinfeld feel, but some of the same sort of story points-an object sought but hard to gain despite the fact that it is fairly simple; bad directions; how it comes back to bite us in the ass when we don't help people we easily might; or when we do help people; the ethos of the working classes; how hard it is to exchange something at a department store; etc)-but he does so so well that it is actually more enjoyable than Seinfeld.  In fact, owning the Curb Your Enthusiasm collection makes buying Seinfeld feel unnecessary; it is sharper, more bitter, and more realistic.",1094515200,,606,4.559633027522936
2028185,5,B0001US8EE,"I'm a CYE virgin. I saw the second season, before seeing the first. My brother is a huge fan of the show and told me to see it. David is hilarious. The show is Seinfeld mixed with a little Woody Allen. There's so much nauurotic behavior in Larry. Great stuff.",1091318400,,259,4.2
2028186,5,B0001US8EE,"During my first viewings of this show, I could not get past the neurosis of it; all that it did was bring out my own case of nerves. Luckily, I happened upon it often enough to get over that. Once 'inoculated', the humor has no equivalent; the viewer simply has to accept the incredible discomfort intertwined with with this humor by appreciating that it's somebody else's problem. Unlike other acquired tastes, (smoking, drinking..), you'll be all the healthier for it.",1090368000,,470,4.8875
2028197,5,B0001US8EE,"Curb Your Enthusiasm is the hilarious HBO series starring Larry David as himself.  The series have no solid plotlines, they are basically set up as shells, with the actors improvising most of the lines.  Mr. David may well be the funniest actor on television.  He is a crotchity, acerbic guy who is constantly getting himself into trouble by saying or doing the wrong things at the wrong time.  Season two features one of the series' best ever episodes, Shaq.  Larry is bemoaning his perpetual bad luck when he gets courtside seats to a Lakers game.  During the game, he accidentally trips Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal, sending Shaq to the hospital with an injury.  Of course Larry is blamed for the injury and is ostracized by all his friends and hated by everyone.  But Larry hits a good luck streak, where everything is going his way for a change.  He even starts hanging out with Shaq in his hospital room, but in the end, Larry screws it up and his bad luck returns.  Season two features the usual compliment of guest stars including Mr. David's former Seinfeld cohorts Jason Alexander & Julia Louis-Dreyfus, good buddy Richard Lewis and the usual stellar support from regulars Cheryl Hines & Jeff Garlin.",1089676800,6,1210,4.774038461538462
2028198,4,B0001US8EE,"I rated this four stars relative to the series as a whole; in relation to every other comedy currently on the air, it really warrants the full five stars. In short, I have to agree with other reviewers who feel Season Two is probably the weakest in the ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" series. Still, this is worth the price of admission for the ""Doll Head"" episode alone, maybe the funniest 30 minutes ever aired in television history, even if the rest isn't quite up to the usual Larry David standards. And while I'm not generally a fan of DVD extras, shelling out 35 bucks for a no-frills five-hour's worth of viewing seemed a tad inflated compared to similar DVD sets on the market (really, all the HBO series DVD's are over-priced).
It was still worth it in the end, as nothing makes me laugh harder than watching this poor shlub stammer his way through ridiculous situations of his own making. Priceless moments this season include an uncomfortably realistic bit with Jason Alexander suffering the slings and arrows of post-Seinfeld Costanza-typecasting; Ed Asner's hysterical turn as a gruff and horny old geezer on his last legs; and a horrified Larry encountering his shrink sporting a package-revealing thong at the beach -- not to even mention the nightmarish water bottle incident in the ""Doll Head"" episode.
This is ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" undergoing growing pains, unsuccessful in fully re-capturing the spontaneous greatness of Season One and not yet on the reliably steady legs that will later hallmark its prime. While the writing and guest spots improve markedly in subsequent years, this series is still superior to everything being served up by the networks, even in its weakest hour.",1089072000,13,1693,4.964788732394366
2028199,5,B0001US8EE,"If you loved Seinfeld, you will love Curb Your Enthusiasm.  Like Seinfeld, this show is mostly about nothing.  While it does have situations mixed into the fold, the core laughs come from throwing the characters into everyday situations and picking apart the day-to-day things that we all can relate to.
It has been common knowledge that Larry David, the co-creator of Seinfeld was the real-life version of Jason Alexander's character, George Costanza.  When you watch this show, you can't help but see the similarities.
One of the more interesting things about this show is that the dialogue is totally unscripted.  This adds a freshness to the show that is very unique.
The show features a lot of cameos from Larry David's circle of Hollywood friends who generally play themself.
My only complaint is that there are only 10 episodes per season.  I can't get enough of this show.  It's clearly the funniest show on TV today!",1089072000,14,925,4.897435897435898
2028200,5,B0001US8EE,"Holy moses, this stinker is phunnier than the first season (check my first revue for more info).  Larry David is the ultimate fuss-budget and you will laugh harder than ever at his antics.  Elaine (from Seinfeld) is back and better than ever.  And everyone has a great time or seems to be based on how into it they all are.
I will say that the dvd is a little expensive considering it is just two discs.  But in the end, it is worth it if you like the style of comedy that Larry David has to offer.",1088035200,2,498,4.103092783505154

2028202,5,B0001US8EE,"Season One was wonderful. Season Two is terrific.  Too bad all America doesn't have HBO so they can grow to love this unusual and very funny show.  CURB follows an intricate formula with the same precision of a Bach fugue.  That's why I can watch these episodes over and over again without getting tired of them. (Try that with your average throw-away TV sitcom!) If it takes one sampling to hook you, I recommend ""The Doll.""  This episode has so many little comedic set-ups and pay-offs running through it that you shake your head (while laughing) in complete respect for what Larry David pulls off when the 30 minutes are over. These days, TV gives us hundreds of channels of mostly-crumby programming.  CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM is a unique entertainment from a really original and creative mind.  Buy this and enjoy!",1087689600,10,815,4.785714285714286
2028203,5,B0001US8EE,Curb Your Enthusiasm is a breathe of FRESH air. I love it. If you're having a bad day I would highly reccommend watching this season and the others.

Larry David, like Gleason, has his own brand of genius.  THE SHRIMP INCIDENT, SHAQ, TRICK OR TREAT can stand shoulder to shoulder with TV OR NOT TV, THE GOLFER and THE $99,000 ANSWER.

2028205,5,B0001US8EE,"This show in the 4 seasons that have aired is comedy that is nothing short of brilliance, and the core of the minds producing it's genius work is Larry David. He was the true brains of Seinfeld and this show is the continuing proof of his brilliant mind for great comedy. Larry's own character in the show is the obvious inspiration for Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza. You can see Jerry and George in his attitude, his facial expressions, his movements, his interaction with people, and even his voice. The stories in Curb your enthusiasm and the way people interact with one another are all very similar to the Seinfeld style, with the exception of all the dirty 4 letter words thrown around of course. Larry has the knack for making people who watch the show cringe with embarassment for him. He never fails to hurt someone's feelings somehow and have it bite him in the rear-end later on in the show or even later in the series. With appearences by big name hollywood stars to add to his roster of characters, Larry David has definite potential to have another legendary show to remember him by.",1080172800,8,1102,4.627551020408164

Larry, in the most innocent nonchalant and matter of fact ways, deals with racism, sexism,  lesbianism, therapy, religion, incest, child abuse, handicap,  disease,  death, terrorism, Israelo/palestinian conflict, and finally radical islam in season 9, and still  and manages to be hilarious without ever being offensive with  in all these sacred topics. His ""Nail Christ"" episode is a master piece on religions. Larry also brings his  fiesty, candid,  logical, honest and fair Brooklyn sense of justice of the working class into the more zen, elitist and pseudo humanitarian Beverly Hills bourgeoisie.
