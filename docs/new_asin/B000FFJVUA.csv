This DVD WILL NOT WORK IN NORTH AMERICA! I had to rig up a back waters system to allow my son to watch them. The stories are so lovely, the whole family LOVES Pat!",1380499200,,302,4.135593220338983

DVD is well done. It is an International format so you need the correct DVD player to view the DVD.",1371427200,,220,4.390243902439025
