This is the first Korean drama I've watched after hearing about the hype from friends and I was quite suprised at how much I was drawn into it. After watching hundreds upon hundreds of American romantic dramedies involving Caucasians (never Asian couples), this may be the deepest identification I've had with TV characters being Asian myself. From that perspective, I enjoyed this drama perhaps more than any other I've watched. The tension in the relationship of the main female/male leads, Yoo-rin & Gong Chan, is done quite well, always moving at a pace that keeps the viewer interested. The female lead, Yoo-rin, is quite charismatic & cute as a street-smart 'liar/bluffer' who meets her match in Gong Chan, a strict, straight-arrow type but with a soft heart. The tension in their relationship is similar to that of 'Pretty Girl' with Richard Gere & Julia Roberts.

One of the things I wasn't prepared for was the range of emotions that Yoo-rin shows throughout the series, but none more poignant than when she cries out of shame and regret. I couldn't help but feel the weight of her pain.

The one actor that I wasn't used to seeing was Lee Joon Ki, who has a very feminine, Anime-type face. I think it's a combination of the hair and his face, but also his character isn't the most appealing, being the 'player' that he is.

The side stories are also as entertaining as the main plot, often times silly. At times, the stories had me rolling with laughter.

The soundtrack used in this series is modern and works quite well in evoking the emotions, particularly after a sad or determined moment. The show also has cliffhanger moments at the end of each episode, prompting you to watch the next one and the next.

Although this is my first Korean drama, I have a feeling that it will be one of my all-time favorites. Definitely recommend giving this series a shot.",1166313600,5,1949,4.700879765395895
