8581865,4,B00CHQS9GM,"GIRL ON THE RUN (aka: HONKY TONK BURLESQUE- 1953) takes place in a carnival, showing the dark underbelly beneath the facade of fun. Or, something like that. It seems that the carnival's burlesque shows have attracted too much heat from the authorities lately. A reporter, named Bill Martin (Richard Coogan) is on the lam, framed for his boss' murder. His girlfriend, Janet (Rosemary Pettit) is to hide at the carnival, posing as a performer, while Bill goes in search of the real killer. Exotic, ethnic dancing breaks out! Janet quickly finds herself trading in her conservative clothes for more... revealing attire, while the cops lurk nearby. Also, a Mr. Reeves is very interested in finding Bill and Janet. Can Martin uncover what's going on, before real trouble begins? Will Janet ever get her dance steps right? With a midway full of interesting characters, this movie is very enjoyable from start to finish. I especially liked the hard-edged Lil (Edith King), the diminutive carnival owner, Blake (Charles Bolender), and the lovely, tall-drink-of-water known as Gigi (Renee De Milo). A nice example of low-budget film-making done right!... P.S.- As another reviewer pointed out, Steve McQueen is in this movie as an unnamed extra. Watch for him, as he shows up a few times!....",1515888000,2,1283,5.085308056872038
8581866,4,B00CHQS9GM,"""Girl On The Run"" is one of those deliciously naughty little films that easily fits into the ""Guilty Pleasures"" category.  Released in 1953 by Astor Pictures, a bottom tier Poverty Row studio, ""Girl On The Run"" operates much like a real carnival sideshow, it dangles the carrot and hopes that the gawkers will bite.

""Girl On The Run"" is 65 minutes of film noir made on a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns and barely knowns who, for the most part, put their hearts and souls into their roles.

Director Federico Fellini's first film ""Variety Lights"" (1950) focused on a rag-tag variety troupe who traveled from Italian village to village to entertain the peasants, much like this film's cheap little carnival traveled from town to town to entertain the hayseeds.

Fellini's ""Variety Lights"" also utilized the talents of a number of real life traveling performers, mostly full-figured female dancers decked out in scanty costumes; much the same as this film utilizes real life carnival sideshow exotic dancers.

""Girl On The Run"" has the distinction of being the only known film appearance of Renee de Milo as ""Gigi,"" the star of the show; and as her billboard says: ""Direct from Paris.""  Also, it is said to be the first (uncredited) film appearance of Steve McQueen, shown early in the film walking around the carnival with his arm around his girlfriend.

""Girl On The Run"" has a story as seedy as its carnival backdrop.  Hot shot investigative reporter Bill Martin, played by Richard Coogan, gets in an argument with his newspaper editor before heading for the local carnival to look for clues that might lead to a killer that he has been covering for the paper.  Bill also takes along his beautiful brunette girlfriend Janet, played by Rosemary Pettit.

While at the carnival, Bill discovers that his editor has been murdered and the police are looking for him as the prime suspect.  Then Bill begins a game of cat and mouse with the police at the carnival as he continues to look for the killer.

Janet thinks the police will force her to tell them Bill's whereabouts, so she ducks into the dressing room of the carnival's exotic dancers.  There she encounters Lil, a sort of den mother who rides herd over the dancers.

Lil suggests that in order for Janet to fit into the carnival surroundings and elude the police, she will need to shed her conservative skirt and jacket outfit and squeeze into a little black costume, the same worn by the exotic dancers in the show.

Janet balks at the idea, but Lil dangles one of the costumes on her forefinger and growls, ""What's the matter, honey, are you deformed?""

Janet manages to stammer out an embarrassed ""no,"" and proceeds to shimmy into the costume.  She then joins the other dancers on the small sideshow stage, and tries to fit into their dance routine without much success.

Meanwhile, Bill is hiding under the dancers' stage until Gigi discovers him.  Thinking he's the typical carnival ""pervert,"" she marches him over to the carnival manager's office.

I won't spoil the rest of the film, but the plot continues to meander around in the dark shadows of carnival tents while a bevy of high-kicking dancers entertain the rubes.

Following ""Girl On The Run,"" actress Rosemary Pettit, who played Janet, appears to have dropped out of show business.  The film's star Richard Coogan lived a long and eventful life that ended in 2014 just a few days short of his 100th birthday.

If the viewer doesn't set his expectations too high and gets the urge to eat cotton candy while watching strange little carny films, then ""Girl On The Run"" just might be worth a try.  So step right up, buy your ticket, and take a peek through the tent flap at the guilty pleasures inside.",1426118400,11,3729,4.754658385093168
