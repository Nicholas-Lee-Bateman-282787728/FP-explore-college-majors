8276381,5,B000KJQ37K,"This is a great mountain biking dvd. My only complaint is that there is some rap music in the sound track. Maybe it's just me but rap has an inner city, gang banging, crack smoking feel to it and doesn't go along with being in the great outdoors, breathing fresh air and exercising. The scenery is beautiful and some really great biking footage. My 4 year old loves to watch it. Those guys are crazy. Oh the other review about satanic footage is nonsense.",1208736000,,455,4.428571428571429

8276383,5,B000KJQ37K,Another awesome freeride film with cutting edge riding and sweet tunes (with the exception of 2 or 3 really lame songs). It definitely gets me pumped up to ride everytime I see it! A must have for any freerider's collection.,1179964800,2,224,4.625
8276384,5,B000KJQ37K,"Big D at freeride entertainment has done it again.  This is one of my favorite biking films and covers a broad spectrum of freeriding.  From Northshore and whistler to utah and parts of europe.  All the big names are back for another round in Flying High Again.  Great opening scene, great camera work, and as always spectacular jumps and stunts by the worlds best.  I definetly recommend this title and all the other New World Disorder films.  A must buy for any serious biking fan.  You will NOT be disapointed!!!",1168560000,3,515,4.655555555555556
