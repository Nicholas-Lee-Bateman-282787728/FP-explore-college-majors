8537300,3,B00979KQ3Q,"Barry Coe is an unknown handsome young star of the 60s. He got supporting role in few movies. Only 4 movies would be able to search from various providers, The Bravados (Gregory Peck), 3000 Spatans (Richard Egan), Peyton Place (Lana Turner) and this one.",1415318400,,254,4.795454545454546

He eventually gets the court wizard's position in order to ensure that the true heirs take the throne of Bagdad, but his efforts create a comedy of errors before he finally comes though in the end.  This vehicle for up and coming Dick Shawn should have been played more broadly by everyone.",1390089600,,371,4.6923076923076925
8537302,2,B00979KQ3Q,"I've been putting off writing this review since seeing ""The Wizard of Baghdad"" yesterday as I completely taken aback by the ineptness of this feature film from 20th Century-Fox Cinema Archives (yes, a Cinemascope picture given the pan and scan treatment again) from 1960 (not all that long ago).  Sam Katzman was the producer, a guy who specialized in teen movie monsters and some rock and roll movies like movies for Elvis like ""Harum Scarum"" where they probably got a lot of the costumes from this epic he made five years earlier and the similarly inept ""Get Yourself a College Girl"" where Chad Everett's music publisher's office had a few pieces of sheet music tacked on the wall of a room with a desk in it.  At least they had the jump on Universal who in 1964 released ""The Brass Bottle"" about a troublesome genie starring bigger talent like Tony Randall, Barbara Eden (later everyone's favorite genie ""Jeanie"" and a lot funnier.  Wonder where they got the idea?) and Burl Ives as the genie.  Well, ""Wizard of Baghdad"" starred Dick Shawn as the troublesome genie in old Baghdad who likes the taste of drink and gets most of his help from his horse that can talk.  Wonder if ""Mr. Ed"" creators saw this film or did they both see the ""Francis the Talking Mule"" films from the forties?  Well, no one really knew that Dick Shawn was not really funny enough to star in a movie before.  But wait, this picture also had as the lovers, a young beautiful Diane Baker who deservedly went on to better things and Barry Coe, getting to be a staple on the Fox lot after playing ""Rodney Harrington"" in their acclaimed film version of the blockbuster ""Peyton Place.""  The hapless director was George Sherman from a screenplay by Jesse I. Lasky, Jr. and Pat Silver based on a story by Samuel Newman.  Probably sounded better as an idea, although the screenwriters came up with a few inspired ideas and the rest just dull and silly.  I've never seen ""The Brass Bottle"" that I can remember, but I was always under the impression it scored an AAN for its special effects, but the wizardry in ""Wizard of Baghdad"" is really awful, the wires for the magic carpets, etc. definitely showing leaving you wondering what was supposed to be magic?  Of course, 20th also did not restore any of this and the Color by Deluxe was faded.  I guess through the years of making money with rubber monsters and audiences paying to only be disappointed afterward for the most part when they learn they've been duped you get used to a bad review.  Well, I knew I was taking a chance, that the movie had to have a certain charm, but it's time for just another history lesson.",1389830400,3,2638,4.563559322033898
8537303,4,B00979KQ3Q,"Love all the Ali Baba, Sinbad movies from the 50-60's. But i don't remember this one.
Now, when you have the Genie opening up the movie with a song which was pretty
good, it showed me a real entertainer..even if the movie wasn't one on par with
other genie movies...its still good for what it is.
Good story, good costumes...pretty good acting and some comedy made me give this
little gem a thumbs up.
It was really a 3 star movie...but hey the Genie can sing....!!!",1372032000,2,466,4.430232558139535
