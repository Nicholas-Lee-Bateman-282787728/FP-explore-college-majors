  I can not see any reason why Seinfeld hssn't been released on DVD, many others have (M.A.S.H.,Freinds). By not releasing Seinfeld on DVD, you're doing the show a huge injustice.",1025740800,,307,4.666666666666667
1452505,5,B00005JLEX,It would be great to have all the Seinfeld episodes on DVD.  I currently have all the episodes on VHS.  This will be a big seller because there are a LOT of Seinfeld fans out there!,1025740800,,181,4.0

Tops all ensembles ever!",1024444800,2,363,4.983333333333333
1452508,5,B00005JLEX,I'm dying over here!!  I still enjoy watching Seinfeld almost every night.  I would love for the entire 9 seasons to be released on DVD.

1452510,5,B00005JLEX,"If I could have one wish in the whole world it would to have all of Seinfeld's 9 seasons on DVD. Why has it taken so long to at least release one season considering all the other shows that have and aren't half as good as Jerry, Elaine, George and Kramer? Who ever is in charge of deciding to release the shows on DVD, for the sake of all the Seinfeld fans around the world.....PLEASE DO IT!!!!",1022457600,9,394,4.12987012987013
1452511,5,B00005JLEX,"Please release Seinfeld on DVD.  I've seen Simpsons, MASH, and Friends are realeased on DVD.  Seinfeld was and is much more popular than those 3 other shows.
Also, when release on DVD, don't do it one season at a time.  Release all 9 seasons in one bulk package.  Millions of dollars would be made off of this.

1452872,5,B00005JLEX,"This is such a great DVD.

Many people say that the first 2 seasons of Seinfeld are not very good. They are wrong for me! These episodes are fun! And they have the same style, wit and cynicism of the next classic seasons (not THAT great though).

I'm a big fan of The Phone Message, The Stranded or The Baby Shower (just to name a few).

Also, the bonus features are brilliant.

Watching interviews with Larry David is always interesting. And with the producers from NBC, the audio commentaries from the actors and screenwriters, etc. This DVD has everything!

The video image is beautiful, by the way. And the spanish subtitles are very useful.

The packaging is nice. The little booklet doesn't have too much info but I guess all the information is on video.

What I didn't like was some kind of duct tape glue residue which was on some parts of the DVD case. I couldn't take it off.",1433116800,,885,4.459627329192546

The characters are still forming and finding themselves. Season One - is a very brief season indeed - not a full slate of shows for a typical TV season, and I never knew why until I bought these box sets. You can find out why also when you buy them, because they are packed with extras and behind the scenes interviews and mini-docs that go into great detail about the origins of the show and its evolution.

1453328,3,B00005JLEX,"(Season One 2 stars, Season Two 4 stars).

While over the course of the series it is hard to give Seinfeld anything but 5 stars, it is difficult to watch the first season without a grimace. Even though it's set in the same apartment and the characters all essentially look the same (well, not Jerry's dad or Kramer), it's almost like you're watching an entirely different TV show. Based on one season we are all fortunate that the series did not get cancelled before it went on to be one of the best series of all time.

Things don't start to really come together until the second season, although many of these episodes can also still be somewhat clumsy.  A good example is the ""The Chinese Restaurant"", where you had many novel things taking place in terms of plot set-up and camera work.  There were lots of funny lines that eventually became part of the Seinfeld lexicon (""Cartwright, four!""), and many consider it to be the springboard for becoming ""the show about nothing"". The entire episode revolves chiefly around waiting for a table at a restaurant when you're really hungry. Who would have thought that could be funny? Well yes, in season two that turned out to be the case. In season one, not so much. There was a reason we hadn't seen this approach done too much in the United States before, but the rough edges start to get worked off.

Many fans give these early episodes somewhat of a pass because they were innovative and ultimately hey, who now doesn't like Seinfeld?  But interestingly there is nothing new under the sun, and for those looking for proof that such comedies ""about nothing"" have been taking place for decades they should check out the 1950s era movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Morning-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780023307/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Morning (The Criterion Collection)</a>.

No, its not Seinfeld per se, and everyone who likes Seinfeld may not care for it (it's rooted in Japanese humor and subtitled for one).  But the movie is essenially nothing more than a movie-length sitcom about nothing. Most of the film features meaningless dialogue taking place in a small Japanese 1950's era suburb and pub that would not seem too far out of place from a certain New York city apartment complex and diner. The cramped asian housing quarters force you to get to know everyone whether you want to or not (they all open doors without knocking like Kramer and just walk right in). Other neighbors also include unpleasant ""Newmans"" that like to gossip and cause trouble, counter-culture bohemians, nosy neighbors that borrow things, and frequently unemployed hanger-on ""Georges"" that are mostly friendly (but selfish enough to take advantage if they need to). The closest thing to a plot here is about two self centered yet somehow still endearing kids who get upset that their parents won't by them a TV set (As George would say, ""that's an episode""). We were about 15 minutes into this and my spouse said ""What is this, Japanese Seinfeld?"".

Overall, the good episodes here easily outweigh the bad, and for many fans even a bad Seinfeld is better than most other shows. It is also fun to see some of show's ""firsts"", like Elaine pushing Jerry or watching Kramer's early hair style and knowing where it will go (or ""go out"" in the case of George, who had more hair at the beginning of all this then I remembered). Additional characters like Newman start to make it more of a true ensemble cast that really has only been matched in modern times by the Phil Hartman era seasons of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NewsRadio-The-Complete-First-Second-Seasons/dp/B0000ZMH8S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NewsRadio - The Complete First & Second Seasons</a>.

If you are like me, the last season of Seinfeld was also a disappointment (especially the final episode), and it was obvious that the series had run its full course. Still, inbetween the bookends of bad seasons 1 and the grande finale is some of the best sitcom TV of all time. Season 2 is still worthwhile, and would be closer to four stars if it were offered on its own.

Considering the inexpensive price of this two season package now in 2012 it's easily worth picking up in my mind for everyone and not just the Seinfeld completist.  If you would rather dabble first, I would start out with season four.",1335657600,4,4401,5.06353591160221

1453393,5,B00005JLEX,"There's much more to appreciate about the first two seasons of Seinfeld in retrospect.  The show didn't get much acclaim in its infancy, but later success allowed the staff to become much bolder with ideas and characters.  But looking back on the episodes now, it's impressive how early on Seinfeld himself had realized the personalities of George, Elaine, and Kramer, as well as the show's niche of being about ""nothing.""  For audiences seeing the first episodes back in 1989, it was funny, but a bit confusing.  The show's star was also the show's main character, who happened to be a comedian (both in real life and on the show), with snippets of his stand-up loosely connecting seemingly random events in his life.  His three best friends are his ex-girlfriend, a hyperactive neurotic, and a one-named shut-in (it took a few more episodes for Kramer to evolve than the other characters).  A lot of people just didn't get it yet.  So even though the writing did strengthen later (as a direct result of being able to take more liberties thanks to the show's building momentum) the early episodes have some hilarious moments and are great fun to look back on now knowing all of the characters much better.  Favorites include The Stake Out, The Robbery, The Pony Remark, The Busboy, The Baby Shower, The Jacket, The Chinese Restaurant, The Phone Message, The Apartment, The Stranded, The Statue, The Heart Attack, The Revenge, and The Deal.  So that's 14 of the 18 total Season One and Two episodes that I count as favorites, so needless to say, I think this is five stars, even though not quite as strong a five as the later seasons.  Additionally, the special features make all of the Seinfeld sets better than most shows.  Hours and hours of commentaries, documentaries, outtakes, commercials...just about everything a fan could think of that they'd want to see is here.  This is a good start to what became a legendary sitcom.",1313193600,,1930,4.815151515151515
1453394,2,B00005JLEX,"So many successful, even classic sitcoms had a rough start. Very few exceptions: The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Odd Couple, et. al.

Seinfeld went through major changes in approach around 1994-95 and it was fior the better: we went from a funny show centered around a hip comedian who pulls material from his quirky West Side friends who report to him on crazy West Side events. The first two seasons were very ""stagy"", very self-conscious, in the ""please love us"" syndrome. I think Michael Richards was the real ""glue"", shall we say. Jason Alexander is the new Woody Allen; Jerry's acting is generally atrocius. Writing..mediocre. Editing often bad, especially cutaways to gaga audience members in the thankfully thrown away prefacing bit - Jerry on staqe; to Elaine, the ex-girlfriend still dazzled by his wit.

Male Unbonding, The Deal, The Pony Remark, The Heart Attack...all have 1-2 memorable lines but are very weak.

For the deep fan, a ***; for the casual fan a **; a great compensator is the extras - definitely the most entertaining feature.

I want to add that for those middle of the road fans, who just like to wait for the classics, and there are countless in that category starting in 1994 and going to the next to last season, this is completely unnecessary, unless the commentary, etc., is of value. This was a long way away from the masterpieces with the new characters Peterman, The Costanzas, Susan; with a sensational appearance by Marissa Tomei and other notables.

1453479,5,B00005JLEX,"I am a newcomer to Seinfeld. I knew the basic concept of the show but never watched episodes. Not only is the show impressive, so is this DVD set. Seinfeld really is ""the show about nothing"", if you're looking for sophisticated humor this isn't it. If that's your type of thing, you should definitely watch Frasier. Even though this DVD set includes season one and season two, there are only eighteen episodes. But the DVD makes up for that with very informative extras which I'll discuss later in my review. I love how the simplest problem could become bigger and bigger as the episode goes on. It's just so entertaining and the cast do an excellent job in my opinion. One of my favorite episodes was from season one entitled ""the Baby Shower."" But it's hard to describe my favorite part because there are three subplots for Jerry, Elaine and George. And that's another thing, many times the whole episode feels like a subplot but each subplot is combined together brilliantly which makes for fantastic viewing.

The bonus features are some of the best I've seen for a show on DVD, there are just so many. But fortunately it doesn't get confusing finding the one you want. When you select what episode you want to watch on the episode menu, another menu pops up which also lets you select the bonus feature you want to watch that's made for that episode. But if you just want to watch all the extras at once, there is an extras menu which has them all listed there as well. Speaking of extras, here are what the usual extras are for this set. There are audio commentaries with the cast, writers, and creator Larry David, also included with each episode are production notes which will pop up every once in a while, there informative but they can get distracting after a while. There also is a five minute segment featured for most of the episodes called the ""Inside Look"", which just briefly discusses the episodes plot, and filming it, these are very interesting. The rest are bloopers, promos, some old, hard to find Jerry Seinfeld stand-up footage and an hour long documentary on how Seinfeld was created. In all, just a ton of fantastic interesting bonus features that I'm sure you'll enjoy.

Each disc is placed in a separate slim case and the discs episode descriptions and extras are featured on the back. Down below I'll list season one and two's episode descriptions. Just saying, on the DVD the episodes are listed by production number, I'm listing them by their original airdate. ""The Stranded"" (Included on this set) was first aired in season three.

In this collection, we get the entire first and second season, alongside hours of extra features. Although I personally felt that they defined themselves by the third season, the first two contain some great episodes, as well.

""Male Unbonding"" takes the hilarious true-to-life concept of having a ""friend"" that's obsessed with Jerry, yet Jerry doesn't want to be with him, so he makes up excuses that become more and more ridiculous. It also holds the honor of being the only episode that doesn't begin with ""The"".
""The Statue"" contains the first scene that really defines Kramer's character, where he goes undercover as a cop in order to get Jerry's statue back. (""Keep makin' love to that wall, pervert!"")
""The Heart Attack"" features George at his funniest, as they go to a holistic healer who, judging by his persona and house, is somebody only Kramer could know! The episode includes a hysterically funny ambulence scene towards the end, definitely one to watch.
""The Chinese Restaurant"" is a classic example of making an entire show out of practically nothing; in this case, waiting around for a seat at a Chinese restaurant. This is a first-rate example of how Seinfeld was always good at taking a minimalistic idea and stretching it into something interesting.
""The Busboy"" is an interesting episode because it ends with the two stories meeting up at the end, something that would be done in plenty of future episodes. It was also quite funny to see Kramer as clumsy as he was in the busboy's apartment, that's our Kramer!
For those who don't own this but want a dosage of Seinfeld, this comes very highly recommended, equally so for those wanting to get into the Seinfeld series. With over 20 episodes, over 13 hours of extra features, including deleted scenes and inside looks on the episodes (something I really love) and a few hidden ""Easter Egg"" special features, this collection is sure to satisfy!

Jerry Seinfeld is not funny!

Oh, I know what you're thinking: Here's  a guy who thinks Seinfeld was unfunny, but his cast was hilarious.

No. At best the rest of the cast was mildly amusing (although Jason Alexander is a talented actor, he is not necessarily hilarious, hence the two stars).

Because, when it comes down to brass tacks, ""Seinfeld"" *was* a ""show about nothing"" -- in every sense of the word:

The contrived semi-plots, with choppy one-liner segments.

The cloying, annoying, ejaculatory bass riffs between shots.

Jerry Seinfeld posing as this hipster: Yeah, right, a hipster with a ridiculous bushy mullet.  At best, Seinfeld was an Upper West Side Jewish version of Jeff Foxworthy.  You want to know why people think Jewish men are smug, metrosexual wimpish know-it-alls?  I submit Jerry Seinfeld as ""Exhibit A.""  If a WASP played a Jew such as Seinfeld, he'd be accused of bigoted racial slurs against the Jewish people. Grating, like fingernails down a chalkboard.

Oh, and speaking of freakish hair-do's:  Is there anyone alive who thinks that Michael Richards as Kramer would even inspire a single chuckle if shorn of that ridiculous Brillo-pad hair?  Within three episodes, he'd have been out of the door, after having been reduced to haranguing black hecklers in the studio audience:  He's a [n-word]! He's a [n-word]!

Pathetic.

Puleeze! She makes Gwyneth Paltrow look like Kate Winslet, she is so flat.

This package offers the earliest days of Seinfeld and it feels too unreal that this show started some 17 years ago, but even then one can recognize Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David putting forth a creative front in comedy television. The two were creating a sitcom that was both funny and ground-breaking with the simple formula to tell tales of everday living. Sure, The Chinese Restaurant episode turned into a classic and I wouldn't snub that episode by any means, but even better(as you watch them again)are The Stock Tip, The Phony Remark, The Busboy, The Baby Shower, and The Statue, just to name a few.

As the seasons progress, the characters in the show evolve a little bit and slowly become the crazy characters that we've all grown to love.  They all have such perfect chemistry together.  One of my favorite episodes in this collection is The Baby Shower.  I love when George rehearses his revenge speech that he plans to give the lady who spilled chocolate all over his nice red shirt!  Ha....classic!!  The extra features in this collection are awesome, too.  Just buy this DVD set or you'll be yelling, ""SERENITY NOW!!""",1168560000,,698,4.798319327731092
1453597,5,B00005JLEX,"If these 17 episodes were all that existed of this show, it probably would not be such worthwhile viewing. However, considering that it developed by its third season into perhaps the funniest sitcom ever made and stayed that way to its end, it is fascinating. Elaine isn't even a castmember in the pilot, and overall the characters are trying to find their moorings. However, Jason Alexander has the character of George down from the very beginning. His over-analysis of the phone calls or physical actions to figure out a woman's exact motives were really classic George. The next episode, ""The Stakeout"", is the first with Elaine. It's also the first time we hear the name of the imaginary character used as a mythical prop throughout the series - ""Art Vanderlay"". In this case, he is the made-up reason George and Jerry are staking out the building in which a girl works so that Jerry can ""accidentally"" run into her and get to know her better. You see, all he knows about the girl is the name of the law firm where she works.

Season two gets much better, with such classics as ""The Chinese Restaurant"" in which Jerry, George, and Elaine all go out to eat at a Chinese restaurant before going to see ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", but are forced to wait an incredibly long time for a table. This simple concept with which we all have experience, waiting for a table, was turned into comic genius in this wonderfully crafted episode. Everything about this episode clicked from Elaine's desperation, to George's frenetic anticipation, to Jerry's levelheadedness. The only thing hard to relate to in the age of the cell phone is George trying to find a telephone.

""The Deal"" in which Elaine and Jerry try to maintain their current friendship and restart the past sexual side of their relationship - which Jerry calls ""this and that"" - is funny and very spot on as to the relationship between men and women. However, the show must have decided to abandon the concept, because in all later episodes Jerry and Elaine act like this particular show never happened. ""The Phone Message"" is an underrated classic in my opinion, and epitomized the extreme awkwardness of George's situations that would be re-visited many times in Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm. In this episode, George has left progressively nasty messages on his girlfriend's answering machine. He enlists Jerry's help to switch the tape before his girlfriend returns home and hears the messages. Like many Seinfeld episodes, the grand plan of one of the characters (in this case, George) comes to an end in an unexpected manner, but this episode actually had things work out for George in the end, which is something that wouldn't be seen very often afterwards as the series progressed.

The only bad thing about the first two seasons is that you don't see as much of Kramer as you do in subsequent seasons. Plus, there is a bit of rewriting that takes place involving Kramer's financial situation. In these first two seasons early on it is mentioned that Kramer makes more money than Jerry. In later seasons much is made of Kramer's spotty employment history, including the fact that he has been on strike from working in a bagel shop for several years over wages, and he returns to work after the strike is settled only because the minimum wage is finally raised to the wage his union was demanding.

I recommend these first two seasons, mainly for the point of seeing all of the character development that takes place getting everything ready for the truly great season three.",1167523200,3,3541,4.79050736497545

In this DVD featuring Seasons 1 & 2, we are introduced to the three of the four single New Yorks that we come to know and love:  Jerry, Kramer & George.  Later in the Season, after producers decided they needed a female character, we are introduced to the fourth Seinfeld friend, Elaine.

In these first two seasons, Jerry's apartment looks bare compared to later seasons.  Kramer is bit more rough around the edges and George just hasn't quite got his ""game"" (funny) on at this time; but it's still well worth the watching so that you can see these characters grow.

1453599,4,B00005JLEX,"Seinfeld - Seasons 1 & 2 shows the cast and the writers getting their feet wet. Disc 1 covers the series' first five episodes which spanned from 1989-1990. The writing as well as the camaraderie between the cast doesn't leave a lasting impression as ""The Robbery"" is the best episode of an otherwise forgettable disc. Based on these episodes, you would think the series would have fallen off the face of the earth. However, by Season 2, which is featured on Discs 2 though 4, you slowly see the writing as well as the cast's rapport begin to gel. Episodes such as ""The Pony Remark"" and ""The Jacket"" from Disc 2, ""The Chinese Restaurant"" and ""The Statue"" from Disc 3, and ""The Deal"" and ""The Revenge"" from Disc 4, are all very good, with ""The Revenge"" being an early classic. By contrast to their glory days, the characters have yet to find themselves as much emphasis is placed on Jerry's on and off relationship with Elaine. George bounces from intelligent to neurotic throughout the season while Kramer is more of a bit player although he has very memorable scenes on the final disc. As with all of the Seinfeld volumes released on DVD, it's the special features such as deleted scenes, inside looks, bloopers, and exclusive stand-up material, which make them a real bargain. The short documentary on the show's creation on Disc 4 is also a must see. Finally, The Notes About Nothing are very informative as they give you behind the scenes looks, blurbs about nearly every actor who made an appearance on the show, and other little tidbits such as The Kramer Entrance Counter and the boyfriend/girlfriend counters. All told, while the episodes here pale in comparison to those featured on future volumes, Seinfeld - Seasons 1 & 2 show hints of the greatness they would achieve starting in Season 3.",1157932800,3,1800,4.735668789808917

1453650,5,B00005JLEX,"If you're a T.V. Seinfeld fan you will absolutely love the DVD's. The scenes that were cut to insert commercials by syndicators are restored on the high quality DVD versions. I grew up in the United States and had always liked the series from television. I was married while living/working/studying in China in 2002 and bought the DVD's for my wife on our coming to the United States in 2005. She had never seen Seinfeld before and had never been exposed to this style of humor or the slice of American life that the series presents. We have watched the DVD's over and over again and they never fail to make us laugh and lift our spirits when we've had a bad day. We utilize the closed captioning option and it has been a great help for my wife in acquiring an understanding of casual English usage including slang, and idiom. On a more serious note, owning so many seasons and watching the episodes regularly makes you realize the sad truth that much of American life really is focused on the themes of myopic self-interest presented and ridiculed in this series. I sometimes worry that individuals may actually see the series as a validation of their lack of ethics, morals, and connection with the Creator instead of as a revelation and jabbing at today's inappropriate social dynamics; just as the Archie Bunker/All In the Family series did in the 1970's.

The DVD sets include great special features from ""How It Began"" to ""Making a Seinfeld Episode"", deleted scenes, behind the scenes commentary from cast and creators, never-before-seen standup footage of Jerry, original NBC promotional ads and trailers, outtakes and bloopers, and much, much more. It's obvious that a lot of thought and work went into producing the DVD sets and I can't wait until the remaining seasons come out for sale at Amazon. After all; ""Who wouldn't love Jerry?""

Contrary to other reviewers' opinions I find that Seasons 1&2 are at least as enjoyable as the later seasons.  Episodes included in this set are:

Season 1- The Seinfeld Chronicles, Male Un-bonding, The Stake Out, The Robbery, The Stock Tip.

Season 2 - The Ex-Girlfriend, The Pony Remark, The Busboy, The Baby Shower, The Jacket, The Chinese Restaurant, The Phone Message, The Apartment, The Stranded, The Statue, The Heart Attack, The Revenge, The Deal.",1150502400,3,2302,4.847328244274809
1453651,5,B00005JLEX,"Larry David must be a modern day television Midas--though the touch didn't come to him until he was in his 40's. No matter. As the driving creative force behind ""Seinfeld"", as Seinfeld himself admits, he co-created, executive produced, and wrote or co-wrote the majority of the ""Seinfeld"" episodes from the pilot through season 7. When he left the show was never the same again. The character of George is based on him. Kramer is based on his former real-life neighbour, and Elaine's relationship with Jerry is based on his relationship with a former girlfriend. Many shows are based on David's, sometimes very odd, real-life experiences. And then he went on to the great ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". But that's another review.

 Of course, Larry David himself is a very odd individual. The documentary on the making of ""Seinfeld"" that comes with this set is, when focused on David, as funny as any of the shows themselves and the shows are great. He is an entirely unique individual which is clearly where ""Seinfeld"" got it's singular sensibilities from. This dvd set comes with about as many ""bells and whistles"" as any ""Seinfeld"" fan could hope for. Included is the documentary already mentioned--the best of the lot in my opinion--commentaries, line notes, Seinfeld's stand-up routine from his 1981 debut on Carson, bloopers, deleted scenes, etc...

 The shows in these first two seasons are quite leisurely paced. Some fans may prefer the quicker pace that came in the following seasons. Are these two seasons the best of ""Seinfeld""? I don't think so. The best was still to come. But what is that saying exactly? ""Seinfeld"" is the funniest series ever to come to television and if this set doesn't quite match up to the next two that doesn't mean that greatness isn't on these discs. It is. ""The Chinese Restaurant"" episode especially is a ""Seinfeld"" classic and took a series that was already delightfully novel even further into uncharted television waters. Some of my other favourite episodes are ""The Pony Remark"", ""The Jacket"", ""The Heart Attack"", and ""The Revenge"". The simple fact is that every show in this set is funny. Even more, as shown by the huge success of the show in syndication, they are rewatchable funny. Time and again. And that too is unique.",1149033600,2,2264,4.9188481675392675

They succeed in making you feel bad, then make you feel smug - why? - because it's not happening to you.

I expected better from them, and received NOTHING in return for it.

What you won't find on them however is the pilot the Seinfeld Chronicles which is just so fascinating to watch and see how different it is (in fact all of the first season is) to later episodes as well as to learn how it all began. Season one also is not replayed much on TV (at least this is the case in Australia) and I really didn't remember these episodes so it was like seeing fresh Seinfeld episodes in a way.

With Episode 1 there is different theme music, it is set in a different cafe where the waitress knows George and Jerry pretty well.  Elaine is not in this one either, Jerry has a different apartment then the rest of the series, George seems to be the more confident and in control one than Jerry, Kramer has a dog and heaps of other interesting things you'll pick up.  The Special Feature Notes About Nothing are a lot better than in following series DVDs and you learn a lot more about the show such as Helen Hunt turned down the part of Elaine and that the show was not pitched as a show about nothing but in fact a show about where Comedians get their material. There are less features overall than on following series DVDs but any fan of the funniest show on TV is going to want to see these.

You are definitely going to want to own and watch again and again later seasons but you have to at least borrow this series from the video store or library just to learn about what happened at the beginning and how it all began.",1138924800,2,1666,4.19375

1453656,4,B00005JLEX,"I was one of those naysayers who never ""got"" Seinfeld's popularity.  I'd seen bits and pieces of a few episodes here and there, and what I saw always left me marveling that so many people thought it was the be-all and end-all of television sitcoms.  (But I had learned to keep this opinion to myself when outside the bosom of family.  I nearly got mobbed in a cafeteria once by a bunch of ravenous Seinfeld fans for saying this out loud, so I keep mum for the most part.)

Finally, I borrowed the first three season DVDs from a friend to give the show one last shot at showing me what it was all about.  I figured the least I could do was watch an episode or two in full before writing it off COMPLETELY.  But lo and behold . . . I  actually *enjoyed* the show.  It's HILARIOUS.  And futhermore, I finally understand why watching it in bits is useless if you've never seen the episode you're watching.  The key to Seinfeld's humor is that the jokes BUILD throughout each episode.  Something will be idly mentioned early on, such as the proper way to respond if someone sneezes, and it'll be ""hee hee"" funny . . . then it'll come up again two acts later, at precisely the perfect time, and be *absolutely hilarious*.  If you miss the beginning set-up, then you'll have no idea why everyone else is laughing.  Its humor also depends so heavily on character that watching it in bits will never convey to you how funny George is when he's forced to pay for something unless you know how cheap he is, or how funny seeing Kramer find yet another new way to enter the room is, unless you've seen a bunch of others before.  The writing is what keeps the show funny, but the characters and the acting performances are what make it truly shine.

I never realized how different from other sitcoms Seinfeld was until I watched the extras.  There are tons of them here, and the ""Inside Look""s are the best.  Ranging from two to five minutes in length, these segments discuss the episode in question and offer tidbits on them.  An episode like ""The Chinese Restaurant"" seems ordinary by today's standards, but Seinfeld SET those standards -- and back then having an episode take place in real time on one set was so revolutionary that the network didn't want them to do it!

My one complaint is a biggie, and it's the main reason I'm taking off a star.  The extras, myriad though they may be, are VERY repetitive and often pointless.  If you use the ""Notes about Nothing"" feature, you're treated to everything from behind-the-scenes info to the ""Kramer Entrance Counter"" (Which is cool -- there's also a counter for sightings of Kramer's stand-in.) to historical factoids about random things mentioned on the show.  Some of the notes are interesting, while others seem to have been written for the mentally challenged.  And if you use the notes AND listen to the commentary (try it simultaneously for a clearer example) you find that they sometimes give the same information at the same time.  The ""How It Began"" featurette is even more repetitive and actually uses a lot of the same footage they used in the individual Inside Looks, so I recommend watching that first in order to avoid boredom.

Another reason I took a star off is because the show had yet to truly hit its stride.  Season 3 was a lot funnier and I'm sure that once I get around to watching seasons 4-9, it will only get better.  I'm looking forward to it!  This is a great show, and I can't believe I'm even saying that after so many years of turning my nose up.  Well my nose is down now, and I'm finally saying what everyone else has known for years -- this is one of the funniest shows that was ever on television.

PS: Another great benefit of seeing this is that now I am deadly determined to get ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" on DVD.  Seeing Larry David on this show, hearing about him losing his temper and watching the episodes he wrote -- hell, just listening to him TALK -- have convinced me that ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" must be like Seinfeld on steroids, with no crazy network censorship and no filtering of David's words through someone else's mouth.  I don't expect to be disappointed by that one either, and I look forward to logging many hours of couch time enjoying both it and Seinfeld.

It's a pleasure to be recruited, even this late in the game.",1134518400,9,4312,4.494223363286264

1453658,4,B00005JLEX,"Some of the early episodes must be painful to watch for the stars themselves. It's interesting from a character development study over time for hardcore fans but somebody watching fresh for the first time may be surprised at why this series eventually became so popular.

There's not much to the first season - only five episodes. The pilot (the actual series pilot - not the episode the Pilot from season 4) and episode 2 are simply just bad from an acting standpoint. George is the strength of the show and he is probably what saved it from cancellation. But Jerry, Kramer, and Elaine really stumble out of the gate. There's some apparent ad-libs between Jerry and Elaine that fall completely flat and never should have made the final cut. There's some funny scenes in Episodes 3 and 4 and the acting gets a little better. Episode 5 is the first all-around good episode of the series.

Season 2 improves a lot. This is where we see the show starting to take shape. The Pony Remark contains perhaps the funniest single stand-alone scene in the history of the series when Jerry ruins the family get together with his dinner table remark and spends five minutes trying to rationalize his way out of it while his relatives stare at him in contempt. Most of the other season 2 episodes are good with some classics (The Jacket, The Statue, The Heart Attack) and a couple clunkers (The Chinese Restaurant -critics praise it as innovative but the comedy is mediocre - and the season finale The Deal).

1453770,5,B00005JLEX,"I discovered again this show by chance during a business trip in USA, an evening when I was browsing through the TV channels. I knew it already because Italian RAI used to broadcast this sitcom some years ago, but it was a flop: first of all because all foreign movies and programs are dubbed in Italy, so basically you lose most of the funny jokes and lines, and second of all because (this is just my opinion) maybe this show is way too American, too ""New-Yorkish"", if I may say so. Personally, after I watched some episodes in the original version, I totally fell in love with it. I find it extremely funny, the characters are very well designed and I especially like George Costanza, because it reminds me of a lot of people (including myself a little), this bald not-so-attractive man in his mid-thirties, with so many flaws (he is greedy, he has no idea how to relate with other persons in general and how to approach women in particular, he always puts himself in incredible situations; he is constantly complaining about other people being insensitive, but he is insensitive exactly in the same way). I have just watched the episode in which George has to replace the cassette in the answering machine of a woman he's dating and I almost died laughing, he is absolutely hilarious. Even though the situations are sometimes obviously incredible, these characters are so human, and while you are watching the show you think that this might someday happen to you in reality. I understand many people complain about the fact that  the show is ""about nothing"". So what? Most of the time our lives are about nothing; I personally like the way this show approaches serious issues in a funny way. We all need to laugh every now and then.",1119398400,4,1736,4.6547231270358305

This isn't your cheesy,cosy,feel good show where everything happens for a reason and most things end good. This is Seinfeld. Jerry Seinfeld is the most effective and influencive of stand up comedians. I almost crack up each time looking at his dressing sense but then I understand it's the 90's. His observational skill is second to none. He has a soft corner for Elayne (Julia Dryfus) who's trademark ""Get out of here's"" leave me laughing.

This show is made for the couch. It is the show to watch with people you don't get along with. Imagine Seinfeld without any adverts and umlimited re-runs at your perusal.

Some of my favourite episodes on the two dvds are -

First Season,
The Stock Tip (recall Kramer's grin at Jerry's Loss)
Male Unbonding (So stupid and simple , it made me laugh)

Please note,all 5 of the first season episodes have something unique about them. Notice the change in Jerry Seinfeld's accent and swiftness.

Second Season,
The Pony Remark (Jerry kills his aunt by a comment)
The Busboy ( makes me smile with paranoid George)
The Baby Shower (A definite classic with the Russain cables guys and cosmo Kramer)

The Jacket (The best episode in both the dvds. This one made me laugh so much I cried. It seems like a 35 minute comedy with all the action)

The Statue (Incredibly funny, interesting new characters)
The Revenge (a classic Seinfeld...v.v.v.funny too)

I think the second DVD contains a lot of episodes they never aired on the cable telivision. Owning these,I feel like a kid who just learnt what 5 bucks can do and later realises he has 200 bucks.
The absolute star of Season 2 are Kramer and Jerry and their association which is quite funny.

I own the third season too but haven't given it a watch. George remains my favourite character owing to his (negative)humanity in general.

Just so you know the following episodes are on the respective DVDS-

First Season - The Seinfeld Chronicles,The Stakeout,The Robbery,Male Unbonding,The Stock Tip

Second Season - The Ex-girlfriend,The pony remark,The Busboy,The baby shower,The Jacket,The Chinese Restaurant,The Phone Message, The Apartment,The Stranded,The Statue,The Heart Attack,The Revenge,The Deal

1453870,4,B00005JLEX,"Back in the summer of 1990 a little show aired during the summer entitled THE SEINFELD CHRONICLES. For a summer filler show, it did alright in the ratings and was eventually picked up for a full half season. Eventually the name was shorten to simply SEINFELD and thus began one of the funniest and most inventive comedies of the last quarter of the twentieth-century. The elite and the ignorant alike refer to SEINFELD as being the first television show about nothing. Well, SEINFELD really is about something--it's about everyday life. In some ways, because of how personal Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld made the series, it is in some ways one of the most realistic comedies about life every produced.  The show was and always will be pure genius.

Volume 1 off the SEINFELD series offers the 1st and 2nd season of the show.  Including the pilot episode, the 1st season only included 5 episodes. However, even in a few of these early episodes, the genius of the show can be seen. In ""The Stake Out"" George makes the first reference to his dream of being an architect and in ""The Robbery"" Kramer makes his first big impression when he leaves Jerry's apartment door open while Jerry is on a trip and is robbed.

The 2nd season includes 13 episodes--a full half-season. In ""The Chinese Restaurant"" Jerry, George, and Elaine spend thirty minutes waiting for a table at a Chinese Restaurant (this is the show the coined the series as being a show ""about nothing""). In ""The Phone Message"" George begins to truly blossom as he leaves a series of nasty phone messages on his new girlfriend's machine because she hasn't returned his calls, only to discover that she has been out of town. In ""The Statue"" Kramer truly comes into his own as he steals back a statue that a cleaning guy stole from his apartment.  In ""The Revenge"" George is fired for the first time and decides to take revenge on his former employer, while Jerry & Kramer plan to get revenge on the laundry guy for stealing some money.  The volume is closed out by ""The Deal""--an episode that was originally intended to be the final show in the series.

The DVDs include a plethora of extras. Each disc includes 1 or 2 audio commentaries. These are entitled Yada, Yada, Yada. Unfortunately, I found most of these commentaries rather boring. They don't provide any real new information or insight about the series and really serve as filler and not much more.

Each episode can be played with a feature called Notes About Nothing. This is kind of like a pop-up video feature that pops up various information about the episode throughout he viewing. There's a ton of info there, but at times it's hard to keep up and is almost too much.

About half of all the episodes feature Inside Looks. These are a series of interviews with the cast & crew about a particular episode. I enjoyed these the most of all the extras because they are short and informative.

Other extras include a special introductions to ""The Stake Out"" and ""The Stranded"", deleted scenes, special Stand-Up material, bloopers, photo galleries, NBC promos & trailers, a few selected spots from ""The Tonight Show"", and a documentary entitled ""How It Began.""  Outside of the Inside Looks, I found the documentary and ""The Tonight Show"" segments to be the best extra features in this set.

Volume 1 of SEINFELD might not be the best episodes of the series, but it is where & how the show began. A great item for any SEINFELD fan or anyone else who wants to see the origins of some classic modern tv.",1111190400,9,3516,4.653225806451613

1453872,4,B00005JLEX,"Ah, Seinfeld.  The yardstick by which all sitcoms are measured.  Could anyone have guessed the impact this series would have on the western world?  Looking at the 18 episodes in these first two seasons, probably not.  But then again, you are probably not buying this DVD set just for the episodes, right?
Which is why I won't devote much time to the episodes themselves; it's the extras that warrent review.  Seinfeld is Seinfeld, and the episodes are notorious.  Chances are, you've already seen them all already; you may even own them (VCR!).  Sure, it'll be nice to revisit them every now and again, but these are the first episodes, and on their own merit they are far from outstanding, certainly not what we've come to expect from Seinfeld as the series progressed.  So a few short words on the episodes themselves, then to the main course - the extras.

The episodes themselves are not quite up to par.  It's understandable; after all, everyone was still finding their way.  The characters are still forming (with the exception of Jerry, who remained pretty much the same throughout the series). The episodes often suffer from the inexperience of the writers and producers; the pacing is often off,  and there are the occational gaps, dead moments, strange breaks, inappropriate transition points, etc.  It gets better towards the end of the second season, of course; by then the characters begin to resemble what they will later become, and the mechanics click much better.  The content improves as well; watching the first few episodes, you can understand why the series was struggling in the ratings.  The first truely full force ""Seinfeld"" episode in the entire lot is ""The Chinese Restaurant"" (not surprisingly, it was the one the network had the hardest time approving).
Another problem with these episodes is that some of the more daring and fresh approaches they introduced, which made them pack a better punch 15 years ago, are lost on today's audience, who by now has a higher shock tolerance.  The mentioning of a period or bowel movements, which may have been rare in sitcoms in the early 90s, can now be the entire subject of an episode.
Still, it's fun to see the origin of things, to track the development of character traits, and to be able to say, ""Hey, that's the first time they did that!"".

As I've mentioned, the main value expected from the DVD (At least in my opinion) is the extras.  These, unfortunately, are a mixed bag.
Sure, there's lots of stuff.  There's a ""How it began"" documentary; there are ""Notes about nothing"" - subtitle notes that run through the episode for every episode; there are ""Inside looks"" segments for most episodes; there are voice-over commentaries for six episodes; there's a bloopers segment, an extra standup segment (standup bits of Jerry that didn't make the shows) and a few more trivial things such as photo galleries, previews, and Tonigh show segments.  All in all, there's a wealth of trivial and trivia spread around the four DVDs.  But quite frankly, some of the most interesting items are too few, too short, or too sparse in interesting information.

For me, the greatest dissappointment comes from what is possibly the most important extra in any DVD - the voice-over commentaries.  Only about a third of the episodes have these, and most of those are very sparce in interesting details.  Especially dissappointing are the commentaries by Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Michael Richards, which are pretty banal (""oh, that's a nice dress; no it isn't! yes it is!"").  Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld do a better job, and so does writer Larry Charles, but they do only four episodes.  I was seriously hoping for more, because these are the most interesting extras there are - taking you to the heart of episode, with thoughts, notes, anecdotes, etc.  I was surprised that the pilot episode, for example, didn't have voice over commentaries; surely there would be a treasure trove of information.
The ""Inside looks"" are nice.  These are interview sniplets with the cast and crew giving brief insight into each episode.  Unfortunately, some of them are pretty short, and many of them are rehashed from the ""How it began"" documentary (which is great, by the way).
Then there's the ""Notes about nothing"", Trivia tracks that run through the episode.  These are very interesting and in general add a lot of information on things like casting choices, changes in scripting, and occationally trivia bits on references made by characters.  In some episodes they repeat things that were already covered in the ""inside looks"".  Then there's a technical problem - they sometimes to run too fast, and it's hard to read them before they dissappear.  They can flash as fast as three a second - that's a bit much, and quite unnecessary, considering that other times several minutes can go by without a single note appearing.
The bloopers segment is great, but short.  I would have imagined they had more to show after so many episodes (but of course I could be wrong).  A nice touch is showing previews from the bloopers in season three (Jerry Stiller!!!).  The previously unseen standup is also great, and deleted scenes are interesting (even if there are no more than about 10 minutes of them from all 18 episodes combined).  The rest of the stuff is pretty minor, if nice (Especially the Carson show bits).

There's lots of stuff here, to be sure.  I would have liked better quality, and in some areas, more quantity; but over all, it's still enough to leave the trivia hunters satisfied.  So it's not a full meal - you still won't leave hungry.

1453873,4,B00005JLEX,"Seinfeld is my favorite show of all time and could not wait for these sets to come out.  Told my wife if I didn't get this for Christmas I would pitch a fit on Christmas morning and fortunately that never came to pass.  I feel the show really hit it's stride during the third season and continued to build steam.  While season 1 & 2 seem a little slow at first there are some great moments.  The Chinese Restaurant, The Revenge, The Stranded.  The episodes are little more subtle than later seasons.  The characters are still being developed especially Kramer.  You can sense there is some tension between Jerry and Kramer early on and they don't seem especially close.  You gradually begin to see Georges neurotic side especially in The Message and The Heart Attack.  You begin to see Elaines dark side during season 2.  Theres also some cool extras such as the ""Pop-Up Video"" style ""Notes About Nothing"" that you can turn off and on.  Kind of hard to follow the episodes when watching but if you're familiar with the episode and have the notes on it's pretty cool because you get a lot of background information on what went during the filming of the episode and little tidbits regarding some of the references the characters make in the show.  There is also a ""Kramer Entrance Counter"" which lets you know how many times overall since the series started that Kramer has barged into Jerrys apartment.  I could go on about this all night but I've got to watch ""The Revenge"".  Go get it!",1110153600,,1487,4.562264150943396

If you've seen this show its not hard to understand why they say its based on Nothing.  Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer are always getting into predicaments over the most trivial things!  The second season on this dvd has unforgetable episodes like the one where George goes to tell off a pregnant woman at her own baby shower and the one where Jerry offends an old Polish woman by saying he hates people who had ponys while growing up.  If you love Seinfeld you've probably seen all of these but buy this dvd set anyway it has excellent picture and has tons of extras!",1109808000,,690,4.317829457364341
1453875,5,B00005JLEX,"When the first three seasons of Seinfeld were released in November of 2004, it was quite possibly one of the most anticipated television on DVD releases ever. The four stars had all come to terms to be a part of the DVD production and fans were excited about seeing one of the funniest sitcoms of all time on DVD after a long wait.

I for one, was not at all disappointed.

I wasn't quite old enough to appreciate Seinfeld in the first few years but grew to love the show as I went off to college and beyond. The normal everyday life that these people lived showed just how funny things can be, even what seem to be mundane things.

I found the first two seasons (five episodes in season one, 13 in season two) to be quite entertaining. The four characters were just beginning to find their chemistry, but you could tell it would be something that would come together relatively quickly.

I found it interesting that the pilot episode was so much different than the rest of the show. To start with, there was no Elaine. The female character was a waitress named Claire, played by Lee Garlington, who has had small roles in many different shows including Everwood and Friends. In addition, Kramer wasn't Kramer, but was Kessler. And he had a dog, which was never seen again. In the 'Inside Look' section, it is mentioned why the dog appeared. The story is kind of interesting.

Probably my favorite episode of the first two seasons was 'The Chinese Restaurant.' I don't think a show had ever done anything like that, with three characters just standing around waiting for a table. It was unique, but certainly something that almost everybody does and can relate to. The only bad part about the episode was that Kramer wasn't a part of it.

While the episodes enough would have been plenty of incentive for me to purchase the DVD set, the extras on this set are fantastic. The bonus features include  'notes about nothing' which are production notes and behind the scenes notes, the aforementioned 'Inside Look' where viewers can take a look inside many of the episodes through the characters, creator, writers or others involved in the production. There are also commentaries from Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, creator Larry David and even from one of the writers. These provide a lot of great information. There are also deleted scenes and a piece on the creation of the show.

It is hard to believe that this show, which went on to be one of the top-rated shows on television, almost didn't survive the first year. Low ratings were to blame, but NBC held on and gave it another shot and reaped the benefits for years to come. Now only if networks could do that these days with fine shows that don't get immediate ratings and get axed.

This set is a well-done piece and is worth purchasing for anyone who is a fan of the show or even just a fan of good sitcoms. This one was certainly one of the best. A great ensemble cast, good writing and good producing all add up to a great show.",1109462400,2,3028,4.582255083179297
1453876,5,B00005JLEX,"It would be worth buying these for the extras alone. What's amazing here, to me, are the interviews, so you learn how the characters were created and why they evolved the way they did--the little details, for instance, why Kramer's pants are high-waters. It's like a form & theory workshop on sit-com screenwriting and stage production. You learn how nearly every episode came into being. Nothing has been more fun to watch and more inspiring. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed. And if you're looking to read anything, I have to suggest Jennifer Paddock's A SECRET WORD (especially this one to Seinfeld fans, who love clever stories about nothing--or, actually, everyday life put in perspective).",1109116800,3,704,5.130434782608695
1453916,5,B00005JLEX,"Seinfeld was such a masterpiece of sitcom television that even 10+ years later the first two seasons are absolutely priceless entertainment. The key to the genius of this show, I've always thought, is that there are no serious episodes - nothing but comedy from start to finish. So many other sitcoms became unbearable or just crashed and burned because for some crazy reason they decided to develop some kind of serious theme that served as a distraction away from the comedy element. Seinfeld never even came close to doing this and will live on forever as one of the greatest sitcoms ever because of it.",1109116800,,606,4.780952380952381

This show defined an entire generation.  There is nothing you can say about Jerry Seinfeld and his talented cast of riot makers that will ever fully encompass what an impact on comedy this series had, and continues to have.  Facial expressions were born, dances were created, attitudes and catch-phrases sprung out from across the nation.

What fan doesn't know the significance of THE PARKING SPOT?  Or why THE CHINESE RESTAURANT caused such frustration.  These and other classic episodes are all included in this first set.

The additional outtakes, added commentary, and other goodies make it a must-have for any die hard fan, or anyone living under a crusty old rock who just wants to laugh out loud!

Enjoy this but by all means get Seasons 3 also with such great episodes as THE PEZ DISPENSER, THE SUBWAY and THE RED DOT.

You can really see the way the show evolved from a more traditional sitcom (though never cliche or obvious) to what it's known for--a show about nothing--which is also really interesting.

The DVD set also has some really great extras, way better than what you get on most boxed sets.  The commentaries are interesting and funny (especially the ones with Larry David), and I usually am not a huge fan.  There are also ""notes about nothing"" which you can turn on or off like subtitles, which provide factoids about the show and each episode.

I laughed because that is EXACTLY the point of this very clever comedy. You therefore, I repectfully say, have missed the point by miles.

This comedy is very deep, very very flawed characters, two or three story strands per episode, very clever and funny observational humour and NEVER a happy ending. Making it funny and original, especially compared with the conveyer belt apple-pie twee non-humour comedies that get churned out every week onto our televisions.

If the 1 star people want cuddly characters and domestic humour, then I Love Lucy and The Cosby Show are all still running. Me, I prefer this cutting edge humour of now. People mention Mash, but Mash (brilliant) was very much cutting edge and of its time in the same way.

Ignore the people who don't get it. You americans should be very proud of producing this type of comedy. Its universal and brilliant!",1106611200,3,1028,4.764044943820225

You can turn on the Notes about Nothing feature before you watch an episode and notes about the show or the actors will come up throughout the episodes.  There is commentary from the producers and actors about most of the shows and also how they were hired.  You can also see Jerry's first time on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson in the Special Features section along with a clip of Michael Richards on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno.  There are a few deleted scenes that you will find for some of the episodes.

* However... the commentaries in the subtitles are FANTASTIC. They are available for all episodes. Sometimes you have to pause to be able to read everything. It is the equivalent of a master degree in Seinfeldology. I had never seen this feature used in a DVD before and I hope this gets adopted as an industry standard with the same attention to detail.

* The documentaries are well worth the price of the DVD.

* The menus are well designed and fun.

* Deleted scenes and blooper reels are good and plentiful.

The set comes with many extras including interviews and commentary, and a feature called ""notes about nothing"" which puts interesting facts about the individual episodes on the screen in the style of ""Pop Up Video."" I recommend watching the episode without this feature first as the notes are distracting unless you are already familiar with the plotpoints.

While ""Seinfeld"" may have been cutting edge when it aired, the first two seasons and particularly the first eight episodes look very 1980s and lack punch. Perhaps that is because shows like ""Friends"" and ""Sex and the City"" picked up where ""Seinfeld"" left off and pushed the envelope even further. But as a collector's item, this box set is priceless -- especially for the bonus material in which its founders explain how the writers managed to make the scripts tighter and funnier and how Jerry, Elaine and the other stars found their voices. In all fairness, as a documentary in this set explains, it was next to impossible to develop the show's characters until the second season because NBC ordered the pilot, then several months later ordered four more shows and only later decided to order 13 episodes.

1454053,4,B00005JLEX,"Maybe it's just me, but I really hate DVD sets that have hidden features.  When I shell out money for something, just give it to me, don't make it like a video game that has characters to unlock.  The discs in this set have some features that can be viewed only by playing with the various menus to find the other options.  I get annoyed by this.

Now that that is out of my system, I loved Seinfeld over its entire run, watching the premiere when it first aired and then watching the series till it ended.  The episodes are presented in the order they were filmed rather than the order they aired, which actually makes the continuity better for this set.

The Notes About Nothing, an option that displays trivia about the cast, crew, and storyline as the episodes play, are OK, but at times they scroll by three lines at a time too fast to read without pausing the disc, and I read fast.  Had that been remedied before sending these out, I would be much happier with the feature.

The best part of the set, to me, is the outtakes.  When this cast gets to laughing I just lose it, and you can tell from most of the episodes that there were lots of smiles and laughing that went on, from the expressions on the actors' faces and how they are often shot from behind in certain scenes.  I would have liked more outtakes, but for a fifteen year old show they might not have any more than these.  Still great viewing, though.

The behind-the-scenes stuff is OK, if a bit dry and somewhat padded in length by clips from the shows themselves.  The audio commentaries that can be run are pretty disappointing.  There are none with all four cast members, which would have rocked, but some have three (all but Seinfeld), likely due to the money issues that delayed this set so long in the first place.

The problems which occupy them are microscopic ones: It is a huge issue when somebody sees you (apparently) picking your nose. They ""handle"" all those problems mainly by lying and avoidance. They never seem to learn that it does not work.

It is clear that this comes from Larry David, and his personality is even more clear in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", a show I just gave up on. It is openly acknowledged that a lot from both shows comes directly from his experiences and personality (George mostly). Rob Reiner in an interview calls Larry David ""curmudgeonly, misanthropic, and dyspeptic"". And Rob is not even an enemy!

I say amen to that and quite honestly reckon that what we witnessed on our TV screens for what now seems like 9 very short seasons was a sort of pure, ""whipped up out there somewhere in the stars"" kind of entertainment genius that TV in it's current apocalyptic preoccupation with reality dribble and cookie cutter sit-coms may sadly never capture again.  But thank the almighty we can now unleash this comedic lightning in a bottle whenever we need a crack like fix of ""nothing"" by just dropping a DVD into a tray, dimming the lights and pretending it's Thursday night in 1991 all over again.  You know honestly I'm a bit suspicious as to the motives of people who would waste their time writing a review about something they obviously don't get and know very little about, I know ""nothing"" and subtlety are hard concepts to grasp sometimes but if you let yourself go and quit waiting for someone to lead you to the ""one-liners"" to drink you might just appreciate the fact that Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David figured that the audience was smart enough to get ""it"" without ""it"" being shoved down their collective throats.  They understood that the laughs and loyalty they would earn by not dumbing the whole process down by resorting to pathetic ratings period tricks like offering viewers ""an emotional Seinfeld we'd never forget"" or having Elaine and George get married in the season finale' to find out next season it was all just some twisted dream sequence would be much more rewarding in the end.  I guess it's sort of like when they say you should never talk about politics or religion at a dinner party, I think I'll ad Seinfeld to that list, bottom line is, if people don't get it, they never will so why argue the facts?  It's just a dirty shame they find themselves prisoners of such a bleak humorless little rock of a planet.  Now as far as the DVD goes, even without the fantastic extra's (which go to 11) it's Seinfeld on DVD... `nough said!  Heck I would have been satisfied if they'd released it dubbed in Bulgarian and had packaged the whole thing in smelly old mildew ravaged newspaper!

I purchased the entire Series off of ebay some time ago only to be most disappointed with the quality and the commercials which were included!!!

Today I picked up the seasons 1,2,3 and am most satisfied with the quality but most of all I absolutely all of the bonus footage, the interviews are absolutely great, and any Seinfeld fan knows that there simply just are not enough of these interviews, however most of all I love the bloopers that are included, they're absolutely HILARIOUS!!! and very rare indeed. Of course you can not go wrong with the episodes that are digitally remastered and sound wonderful. The season 1-2 set included the very rare Pilot episode titled""The Seinfeld Chronicles"" which I personally have only had the pleasure to see one other time from the set I purchased from ebay.

This is a sure buy for any Seinfeld fan whether large or small. I truly can not say enough about these two sets. I have a very large DVD collection with over 350 DVDs and over 500 recorded DVDs(I have a DVD Burner). I can honestly say that Seinfeld Seasons 1-3 are in my top 5 DVDs, and were worth absolutely every singly penny and more!

Go out and buy these 2 sets, you will thank me later. Get them for Christmas, or Hannakuh or any other way possible, JUST GET THEM however you may. Trust me it is worth all the wait and hype. Best collection to date in my opinion.

Thank you Columbia Tri-Star for releasing these You have saved my Seinfeld collection and I can finally resell my ebay purchased Set. I simply do not need it anymore since these are finally being legally released.

1454130,5,B00005JLEX,"This classic sit-com follows the adventures of comedian Jerry Seinfeld and his three fictional friends--the insecure, easily irritated George Costanza (Jason Alexander), the aggressive,  neurotic Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and the supremely strange Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards)--as  they deal with the absurdities of everyday life.  In the opinions of many (mine included) it's pretty much the funniest sit-com ever.  Over the course of nine years, it developed a huge cast of memorable supporting characters and some truly hilarious story arcs.  My wife and I love this show.

A) Load it up with extras...commentary, deleted scenes (albeit light), gag reel, docs, etc

C) Don't rip us off on the price...i'm talking to you Star Trek, SCTV, etc...

1454191,5,B00005JLEX,"Get Out! ""Seinfeld"" on DVD? He's already the Master of His Domain why would it need to be released it on DVD? Because the fans demanded it and justice can only be served if one of the most popular and best sitcoms can be viewed, uncut and with lots and lots of background material on this groundbreaking show. Just a warning this review is for the gift set which includes the salt shakers, playing cards and a copy of one of Larry David's scripts. That's the main difference between this gift set (that and the fact that it includes the two boxed sets including the first three ""seasons""). The first season consisted of five episodes (including the pilot)while the second consisted of 13 episodes as the network decided to commit to the show when the show received solid ratings. The third season consists of 22 episodes. All the episodes are the uncut original episodes that aired on NBC (most of the episodes in syndication are usually trimmed by a minute or two). The boxed set has a slipover case. Inside the inside slipcase each disc is nicely housed in individual slim DVD holders. 15 commentary tracks (if I'm counting correctly)for both sets. Deleted scenes, unused stand up bits, promos, featurettes make this a generous set particulary when compared to the bare bones releases for other similar (although not as funny) series.

When ""The Seinfeld Chronicles"" (the original title) first aired as a limited series no one suspected it would be the next big thing. Seinfeld and his collaborator/co-creator/co-producer and frequent co-writer Larry David pushed TV comedy to its boundaries and then demolished them. They'd then establish new boundaries and demolish those. That's groundbreaking, important television. It's also what made ""Seinfeld"" unique. Sure, ""Who's The Boss?"" could be funny but it had to be about something where someone learned something in every episode. Seinfeld's and David's mantra ""learn nothing and be about nothing"" proved that TV touching on the absurdity of real life could be funnier than TV where the characters learned valuable lessons and became better people. In truth, that rarely happens in the real world and the fact that Seinfeld made fun of and played with that convention made it important. It helped that it was damn funny as well.

An exceptionally sharp looking high definition transfer makes this one of the best looking transfer I've seen in awhile. The pilot episode doesn't look quite as sharp. It's clear that it's drawn from a second generation videotaped master. The colors bleed a bit but and the image isn't quite as sharp as the rest of the series.

The hour long documentary has interesting, revealing tidbits including a shocker from Julia Louis- Dreyfus-she never saw the original pilot episode. In fact, she didn't see it until she prepped for the commentary tracks and interview for this boxed set. Larry David's acerbic dry fatalistic sense of humor (which informs his terrific show ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" on HBO) along with the witty, informed but ultimately wacky observations of the rest of the cast and crew make this a marvelous documentary. Unlike the featurettes or documentaries on a lot of TV shows (any of the ""Sex and the City"" ones for example), to invert a famous quip by a famous writer, ""there's there there"". Substance for a show about nothing what an ironic twist but in reality ""Senfield"" was about something. It was about the absurd little moments that populate our lives but a little more twisted.

We also get a trivia filled ""Notes About Nothing"" that can be viewed while watching the various episodes. Sometimes it's about...well nothing but most of the time there's fascinating bits of trivia in this text commentary. ""In the Vault"" includes deleted scenes from season 1 & 2. Finally, we get commentaries from Jerry, Larry David, writer Larry Charles and Jason, Julia & Michael on 6 classic episodes. There's also two versions of the pilot with interesting differences included (not the least of which is the weak opening music which doesn't compare to the final theme).

By the end of season two, and the Chinese Restaurant episode, the characters were getting better and the show was starting to take shape.

- Season 1&2 are $80 AUD

- Season 3 is $80 AUD

So, $160 AUD for 40 episodes.  Given that there are 180 episodes, the total cost of owning Seinfeld will be about 160 * 180 / 40 = $720 AUD.  And, to watch these you will be juggling anything up to 30 DVD disks.

Yeuck.

I can't imagine too many people out there spending $700 on Seinfeld - and Target's shelves were full of the first 2 packs, and no-one was buying them (or even looking at them) when I was there.  Maybe when all the packs are released they will have a huge discount sale to clear all the stock that isn't moving - at least that's what I hope.  $200 or less would be great for the whole 180 episodes.

What I am looking forward to most of all however, is the original episode length - most reruns are trimmed to allow for the aforementioned commercials on non network stations, and even episodes you may have seen countless times, feel more complete. Comparing the original network shows with reruns is almost like a ""directors cut"" I noticed little nuances and subtle scenes that made what were previously often disjointed episodes, make more sense - often with hilarious portions trimmed. The ""show about nothing"" as it was billed was hugely succesful, and like others I concur with some criticisms levelled toward the more fantastical plots (especially after season 3). All that said, if you are a fan, this will be an essential purchase. The DVD set is billed as being loaded with extra's from commercials to featurettes, and the all round package represents pretty good value.

1454306,5,B00005JLEX,"Man, how does one go about reviewing one of the greatest t.v. shows ever?  In a few hundred words, no less!

There has been a lot of talk about the 'genius' of ""Seinfeld"".  The show was built on one simple philosophy: real life is the best comedy.  I once heard a comedian expound by saying that the funniest man can sit around and make up hilarious jokes all day long, but nothing will hit a homerun like something that has happened in your everyday life that other ordinary people can relate to.  (This is why ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" is so big, and it goes back to Lucy.)  Seinfeld took normal events and spun them into oddly-familiar but wacky plots.  Similarly, each [main] character was someone we could identify with -- although hopefully not completely.

I think that's genius point A: to take reality (a.k.a., ""nothing"") and tweak it into something to laugh to until it hurt.

Genius point B is thus:  every show featured a ""woven together"" theme.  Each character's individual storyline eventually somehow managed to end up interacting with the other respective pieces.  Two episodes step into mind straight off:  1) when George started doing the opposite of his instinct and went ""up"" while misfortune befell Elaine and she went ""down"" and Jerry ended up ""even"" in-between them; 2) when George lost his keys in the pothole and had to jackhammer them out, meanwhile Elaine pretended to be a janitor - and at one point they pass on the street and nod knowingly about their fake jobs.  This was beautifully illustrated in the final episode when it all came back around and their selfishness kicked them in the collective butt.

Of course they were greedy, selfish and sometimes downright nasty... that's why they were funny.  They were everyday people carried to the extreme.  They were the personified exhibitions of many of the fears and thoughts that we bury in the real world.

That leads into genius point C:  the characters were amazingly well-crafted, individually and as an ensemble.  To illustrate this, look beyond the obvious top 4.  How many shows can you name more than a couple supporting characters for?  ""Seinfeld"" has the parents, J. Peterman, Puddy, Jackie Chiles, Newman, the Soup Nazi, Joe Mayo and so on for a mile.  They played at varying levels of importance -- some recurring, some in 1 or 2 episodes -- but we remember each vividly.  That is amazing.

""Seinfeld"" certainly was not the first great comedy and it will not be the last, but it will forever hold a firm place as one of the big ones.  Not everyone will agree on that, naturally, but the majority sure does and credit should be given to all involved for that gift.  And now that we have the DVDs we can watch them ad nauseum, which will in turn make us fan[atics] profoundly happy, which will mean ""Seinfeld"" is doing something quite unexpected... benefiting the world!",1093478400,13,2862,4.752535496957404

I watch it every weekday when I get out of my job and when the DVD comes out I will surely buy them so I can watch it whenever I want. These 4 characters are hilarious-- people who don't like it really don't realize what it's really about...4 neurotic people put into hilariously funny situations.

Now, for those of you whom do not consider this the greatest show ever, I feel sorry for you because it just means you have missed the point.  OF COURSE THE CHARACTERS ARE SELF CENTERED!  First, the show is about THEM!  Second, its satire, people!  In case you haven't noticed, America is self-centered, and Americans are self-centered.  Sure, there are those of us who aren't, but come on.  If you don't act like the characters in Seinfeld, you at least want to from time to time.  Plus, it's FUNNY!  Oh, Friends makes me laugh, but not like Seinfeld.  The way David and Seinfeld string together the multiple plots is pure genius.  (See Curb Your Enthusiasm for a continuance of this genius.)  Best of all, Seinfeld is the perfect mix of low-brow and intelligent humor.  And there is never any true drama (unlike Friends).  It's just a smart, witty, funny show.  And it's all about nothing.

E.g in 'The Jacket', George and Jerry stuck by Elaine and didn't abandon her cranky dad...which you wouldn't have blamed them for doing. The early series also include Jerry's stand up routines, which I like!

Now, some people prefer the later series, many of which omit the stand up routines, and show the main characters to be selfish, and mean. Each to their own but I prefer the earlier ones. You could empathinse more with the gang back then.",1092096000,5,689,4.548387096774194

Comments on this episode (Good news, Bad news):
? For those who watch Seinfeld for the sake of superman, Do not waste your time looking at the refrigerator, because it's simply not there!!
? Elaine didn't appear!
? You will notice that George was very intelligent, smart and has a very logic way of thinking, indeed, all of these gifts that George had starts to deteriorate as time goes by!!

Some may find non-original Seinfeld DVD sets (all 180 episodes of Seinfeld on DVD) through the internet, and my advise is Don't ever think 'bout it!!!, why?
? They're not original!!
? The bad resolution of all these DVDs
? You can play any DVD only for a few times, and after that!! The bad quality of such DVD shows up it's ugly head!!
? Most, if not all episodes (in these DVDs), have a major defect when watching each and every one of them, in which the last 30-45 seconds are simply not there!! Either it has been deleted or not recorded!!
? The only so-called special feature in this DVD set is the blooper DVD! don't get excited?! because there is No sound in this particular DVD!!
? All these DVD sets, no matter where you might get them, have the same origin (same recording source)!!

Apparently I have a lot of money to spend that month (along with Halo 2). But anyways, back to Seinfeld. I don't care if the season 1 is going to be $50, $100, maybe even $200. It is definately going to be worth every penny. He is genius. Every actor is perfect for their roles. Loved every episode, and even the repeats that are shown all the time, always have the same level of hilarity (probably not even a word) as the last time I saw it. This, I CAN'T wait for.

Baboo is from Pakistan, not India.
With all these complaints about personal Seinfeld tape recordings  being unreliable, with inferior quality, and aging etc, why not just get a DVD set-top recorder already and record your favorites onto recordable DVD?  Sounds like the reason why SeinDVDs aren't out yet are for the fact that everyone watches them on TV and the fanbase increases and increases worldwide....and it's still making money on the TV.  If people really want DVD,  stop watching them on the TV :)  A whole season would be what....like $50 or more?  Multiply that by 9 and you have $450.  Add a inflation equal to the time it takes for all 9 seasons to be available and you have maybe $700+ cost.  Invest that money in a set-top DVD recorder and record your own personal  favorites like you would  VCR.  The commercials would be a nostaglic  :O)  Cause who really cares to watch all of the episodes.  And remember this... SEINFELD will always be on the tube.",1068336000,7,973,4.680473372781065

1454737,5,B00005JLEX,"Seinfeld isn't already out there because there isn't a demand for it or because it wouldn't be profitable to produce. Heck, they put the cult Planet of the Apes series on DVD. The fact is that the rights to the series are complicated. Fox owns the network rights to the sitcom and TBS has recently bought the Cable rights. Even though the series has been off the air for half a decade the reruns still bring in better viewership than some of their networks' primetime programming. Also, running reruns requires little overhead, it is a cost-effective arrangement, more so than producing an original series. As a result, if the DVDs were released, it would stand to reason that less people would tune in to their respective networks for the reruns, lowering the price of advertising and ultimately lowering profits. I am sure that these networks will eventually see the (monetary) wisdom of giving the people what they want, but they are stonewalling for now, and until a deal can be struck, we will just have to wait for the DVDs and watch the reruns on the stations.",1064275200,7,1067,4.711229946524064

1454742,5,B00005JLEX,"I cannot believe the greatest show of all time isn't out on DVD yet.  Seinfeld fans must unite against the man and get this thing out ASAP!
What they need to do is release it in a set containing all nine seasons, with commentary on every episode, interviews with every cast member, creators, and all guest stars.  Then, if they have unaired episodes (which would be GREAT!) they should throw them on.  It would also be quite awesome if they secretly filmed a 2-hour special showing their lives after prison and put it on as a surprise.  They should also have an interactive game with almost all episodes.
That's my vision for the Seinfeld collection.  Most of those things'll probably never happen, but then again I just want the show!

1454743,5,B00005JLEX,"To say Seinfeld is an outstanding television series is an understatement. From the first time I started watching reruns of the show about 2 years ago to the present day, I have not been able to get enough of Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer. The wit and humor of ""Seinfeld"" is unmatched by any other series, past or present, and it will remain as the greatest series in television series for quite some time. From the top-notch writing to the hilarious one-liners to the brilliant supporting cast (Newman, George's parents, Jay Peterman, etc.), this show has it all.
What makes ""Seinfeld"" so great is the vast amount of classic episodes it had over it's nine seasons. Among my personal favorites include ""The Soup Nazi"", ""The Bizarro Jerry"", ""The Opposite"", ""The Voice"", ""The Airport"", and quite possibly the most memorable 30 minutes in TV history: ""The Contest"" (Kramer: ""I'm out!!""). While these are just a few of the classic ""Seinfeld"" episodes, there's something in each of the 180 episodes that will make you laugh out loud 'til it hurts.
There's no doubt in my mind that when it comes out onto DVD, ""Seinfeld"" will be the greatest selling DVD set in history. It's a show about nothing that is full of everything that is wanted in a comedy series: Great acting, hilarious stories, and extremely well-written scripts. Do yourself a favor and pick this up whenever it comes out; it'll be well worth the purchase.",1059609600,8,1417,4.811475409836065

Moreover, just take a second and do the math.  Lets see...9 seasons, that makes 9 DVD sets, and even taking the low side of DVD sets prices today, that's (multiply the 5, carry the 1, add the three...ah who knows!) THAT'S A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY!!!

I have seen shows that aren't even worthy to air on the same day as a repeat of Seinfeld, being released, (i.e. Malcom in the Middle, Friends, Family Guy). Seinfeld has never steered anyone wrong before, every episode is filled with witty qoutes that you know you are using the next day at school, work, church etc. Seinfeld is one of the few shows that doesn't rely on cameo appearances by celebrities to boost ratings, it would rather make up its own characters, (i.e. the Soup Nazi, Poppi, Mulva, Bubble Boy etc.) So Jerry if you want the money to buy yourself another Porsche with, give the word to release the show because SEAN IS GETTING ANGRY!",1049500800,24,681,4.5

I then discovered that although the show has gained little air time (other than a nightly slot at 12 o'clock on BBC 2) over here in merry old england that it was very popular in America and still is with several showings a day. I then came to the obvious conclusion that such a show would surely have been released on VHS format at least. But no. And why the he[ck] not, there are so many people that would love to posess a copy of the brilliant antics of Seinfeld and his buddies. The show cant just be continued to be shown once a day until it is inevitably replaced by further episodes of Dharma and :( Greg or even worse, Mad About You-oh the horror. The show deserves a permanent lodgement in every fans home and if the people behind it don't see that then I would like an explanation as to why they feel the need to torment me like this.",1043798400,9,1007,4.1692307692307695

Firstly, I think whoever is in charge of making the executive decision to get all 9 beloved seasons on DVD and still has not done so should be deported to India with BaBoo Baut!! Seinfeld is undisputedly the greatest TV series ever made! My entire family adores the show.... my efforts, along with my mother and brother taped every single episode on VHS totalling 18 VHS tapes. I watch 2-3 episodes every night before I go to sleep!!
  Now... I know what your thinking.... ""if he has every episode on VHS, why is he so adimant about getting it put on DVD?!?"" Well, I will tell you why!! First, the quality between DVD and VHS is like that of cassette tapes and CD's..... there simply is no comparison. VHS tapes eventually get worn and will not play any longer... the quality has already been substantially reduced from watching them so many times! Second, I have no idea what episode I am about to watch whereas if it was on DVD.... I could go right to whatever show I wanted to see!! And last and most certainly not least.... all of the great extras and bonus material they could put on the DVD collection!!
  I have put a lot of thought into this and I would be willing to pay up to [$$$] for all 9 seasons of Seinfeld on DVD.... all 9 seasons... immortalized till the end of time so that all may see the best show ever made!!
  Well, I think I have made my point.... get with it you white-collared pencil necks and release the greatest show ever on DVD!! I go into Best Buy and every crappy show on the planet is now on DVD from Malcolm in the Middle to Friends! Every great series is for some reason not being put on DVD?!? I would like to see not only Seinfeld on DVD, but also Curb Your Enthusiasm (every other mediocre show on HBO has been put on DVD),GI Joe complete series (Transformers has been released... what's the deal?!?), and the Spider-Man animated series from the early 90's (Spawn has been released and Spider-Man is popular again.... Serenity NOW!!!!)
  Welp... I have said more than enough... if you agree with me... drop me an email to say hi... the seinfeld fanatics and true fans of good comedy need to unite!!

X-Files, Star Trek, Friends, Fawlty Towers, 24, Malcolm and even Space 1999 tv series are now available on DVD. Why not the Seinfeld 180 episodes?
The only reason I can think of is corporate greed. The show is still shown on tv, in the US it is broadcast at least once a day (in my area - even three times now - Fall 2002. Nielsen ratings are not publicy available for non-prime time tv so we do not know how many people are watching, but certainly quite a lot. thus attracting advertisers. What is bad in this, some shows are repeated very often (e.g. Contest or Car Dealership) while others are never or very rarely repeated (e.g. Mom and Pop Store, Puerto Rican Day). Fortunately dvd burners are so cheap now that some individuals offer home made episode collections, but not on ebay, which restricts it and chases for copyright violation. What can we do?
