8398113,3,B003JHY9CQ,"Generally a good introduction to kit knife assembly. It is not a video on knife making however. It does not cover creation or heat treatment of the blade. The presenter takes you through the steps of selecting a ready made knife kit blade and fashioning a guard and handle for it.

Worth a look if you are thinking of assembling a knife kit but you may find the same info on the internet.

Some of the processes shown also made me cringe from a machine safety point of view so use your best judgement if you do want to follow along.",1362441600,,532,4.257425742574258
