I think it was tastefully done and i believe that Katie sue should of been the one to make the cover of the video, she is real, beautiful and is what wal-mart is all about. Everyone sees the beauty on the outside, but you should meet them and see the beauty on the inside. I bought both the dvd and the video, the are both autographed by Katie sue, she's is a real star.",1144540800,3,449,4.113636363636363

I appreciate that the camera pans behind the scenes so I can see the lighting set ups and hearing why the stylist chose colors of make up. For anyone who has a remote interest in photographing models, you could do worse than to watch these videos. I think a lot

of people who find Playboy's videos aren't hot enough would be better off buying something x-rated.",1112400000,16,439,4.628205128205129
1977648,3,B0001906OK,"So yeah, I don't know wether if I wanna become a Wal-Mart employee to work with such hotties, shop at different Wal-Marts all over the country more often, not to take this video seriously and just enjoy the babes or basically laugh my head off towards something so unreal. Yet again it's Playboy so what can you expect? The women are great and if you're into the whole fantasy situation scenario then get it. If you rather see something more realistic just skip this one in the shelf and get all the 'Playboy's Girlfriends' instead, or 'Girls Gone Wild'.",1106697600,9,554,4.606060606060606
1977649,2,B0001906OK,"I can't see how anyone can actually watch this stuff. Playboy was always a weak rag, and their videos are just as boring. The only reason Playboy has stayed in business for over 50 years is because of the occasional celebrity who needs the money.

I watched this DVD at a friend's house. He collects all these stupid Playboy DVDs and was excited to throw this one in. Hugh Hefner must think he's gonna make a fortune off this from trailer park dwellers who'll sell a pint of blood plasma or recycle beer cans to get this.

I've been in Wal-Marts all over the country and I have never, never, NEVER seen any employee looking anywhere near what was portrayed in this. Like I'm supposed this girl 'Tesha' is an actual employee? She has long blonde hair to her butt and has a rack that defies gravity. Yeah sure, I can see her calling up a price check on a case of Sam's Grape soda.

The typical Wal-Mart employees I've seen are 80 year old women who hand you a cart on your way in. You can even hear their colostomy bag sloshing around as they say 'Welcome to WalMart'. Or you got the 350 lbs Jamaican woman at the register with three inch nails painted red and orange. She has a dreadlock weave, a diamond nose ring, gold tooth, and shouts at the top of her lungs ""I need a price check on Depends Undergarments!""

This is bottom of the barrel, even for Playboy. They probably took a bunch of Hooter's waitresses and walked them across the parking lot to trade orange shorts for blue aprons for the afternoon.",1106524800,23,1506,4.367857142857143
1977650,3,B0001906OK,"Playboy has always promoted itself as displaying ""the girl next door"" so I guess this project was an obvious one.  No doubt many of the respondants were glamor-model-wannabes and given the pay rates they must get at Walmart who can blame them?  I wonder about the selection criteria for the finalists presented here, though.  I'm not a fan of tattoos, depilation and shall we say ""attachments"" - if you are then this is for you, but frankly I think the finalists look sexier with clothes on than with them off.

Some have tan lines.  Each get two scenes, one in/out of uniform and one in/out of other outfit.  They all say they feel empowered as they are interviewed, hmmm.

In extras there is an additional scene for each with music.  The usual frantic camera work found in other Playboy material is not as evident here. The covergirl has super long hair. The models are from across the country. Cashiers, photo center, stocker, and Department Manager. They are asked who took their pictures for them.",1373500800,,648,4.908256880733945

8008065,4,B0001906OK,"Please allow me to state that I have been a professional photographer
of women since 1975. This background does influence my review of
this dvd.

The main feature with end credits is approximately 49 minutes in length
and contains individual segments with seven Wal-Mart employees:

Elizabeth Beanblossom (Colorado Springs, CO)
Tesha Mullen (Lancaster, CA)
Deborah Moss (Bozeman, MT)
Suzan Battaglia (Hamburg, NY)
Kathryn McKee (Bridgeview, IL)
Tiffany Stephens (Spring Hill, FL)
Kristi Jones (Sterling, IL)

Each woman talks about herself and is shown in her daily environment. We
are shown that each is a ""normal"" woman who due to her association with
Wal-Mart is presented an opportunity to be in Playboy Magazine and this
video. Most express genuine amazement that this has happened to them.
From the amount of interview information and voice overs one genuinely
gains a reasonable perspective on each woman's personality. None of these
women are objectified as is often one of the closed-minded accusations
hurled at Playboy.

Something for me to appreciate about this dvd is that none of the women
are professional models. Posing nude is not a commonplace occurrence.
It takes courage to walk into a Playboy studio and bare one's body to
a group of strangers. For that alone I applaud their bravery.

All seven women are attractive. The hair and makeup skills that Playboy
is renowned for is evident in each woman's transformation. I enjoy seeing
the behind-the-scenes footage and the actual photography session with each
woman taking direction from her photographer. Others may find this boring.

With slight hesitation to proclaim a standout model in this production, I
will state that Tesha Mullen would be my personal choice of an art model
were I ever allowed to have such choice. And I think Playboy might think
she too was their favorite amongst the seven because not only did they
select her for the dvd cover but had senior photographer Stephen Wayda
photograph her in the dvd. She is the only one of the seven that Mr.
Wayda worked with in this dvd. Of the seven women, she is, to me, the
most memorable.

My second selection for an art model would be Kristi Jones who is
very photogenic. Her absence of tattoos or piercings makes her
simply an ideal natural woman (to my eyes anyway). She is slender
and seemingly unaware of the beauty she possesses.

The notable moment for me is during the nude studio segment with Deborah
Moss when the photographer asks her to turn around to show the back
of her body. She momentarily hesitates. Her voice over narration has her
stating that she is ""self-conscious"" about her ""butt and thighs"". As she
turns her back to the camera one has to wonder how in the world did
she ever get such an idea. Her derriere is incredibly beautiful - as is
her entire backview. This scene speaks volumes about how some women
fail to recognize their own beauty.

For me, part of the charm of Women of Wal-Mart is that all of the women
are ones you might see walking down a street in any town. They don't
appear overly glamorous in street clothes and they don't project a superior
attitude that they are somehow special. But I think each of these seven is
special because each shared her feminine beauty with the world. A lot of
women will never do that. They may want to but are too fearful to do so.

The Special Features include:

Playboy Music Clips - These are individual segments of each of the seven
women posing in the studio as generic music plays. The length of each
varies from about 2 minutes to almost 3 minutes.

Candid Interviews - Each woman answers various questions while seated.
The length varies from almost 1 minutes to about 4 minutes per woman.

Photo Gallery - There is a total of 42 still images of all seven women.

I do not own a vast quantity of Playboy dvds but I'm familiar with the
""Playboy style"" from the magazine, the special edition issues, and the
books. I hesitate to recommend Women of Wal-Mart to the person expecting
a centerfold-type result. If one is seeking a slick, almost overly
polished, production that Playboy is capable of rendering it won't
necessarily be found in Women of Wal-Mart. It is for that reason that
I personally like this dvd.

In assigning a rating I also consider value for money. I subtracted one
star primarily due to the brevity of the main feature. I never pay retail
price for any dvd and I purchased my disc in 2010 at a price much lower
than the original list price. Given the original retail price, I feel that
Playboy could have made it an hour long and added another Wal-Mart
employee. The extras are nice - and appreciated - and do contribute
to my rating of four stars.

8008066,4,B0001906OK,"I really only bought this for two reasons...#1, I got it off here for $1.55, and #2 I wanted to see Deborah on video, because she is a total hottie.

However I did find Deborah's segment a little contradictory...on the video they repeatedly talk about how ""shy"" and ""reserved"" she is, maybe they even say ""modest""...yet she has pierced nipples, and in the opening shots of her walking around she is clearly not wearing a bra? Doesn't seem too modest to me.

Also the bonus footage part with the candid interviews seemed kind of disappointing, but I didn't really watch it all either.",1248220800,,583,4.650485436893204
