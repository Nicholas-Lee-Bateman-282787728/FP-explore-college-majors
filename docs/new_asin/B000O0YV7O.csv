2788743,5,B000O0YV7O,"David Ray Griffin knows how to dig for the truth. The facts he presents in this 2 DVD set are well substantiated and shocking. This presentation showed me that there's much much more to this story then I ever imagined or believed. Many films about 911 that I have seen in the past have always been both shocking and sensationalistic, filled with theory and supposition. This DVD presents well corroborated information and in the end, far more shocking and based on facts, not fancy. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to know the big picture truth behind the tragic events of 911 and the governments inability to act.",1259193600,3,631,4.693693693693693

2788749,5,B000O0YV7O,"The CIA is the agency that dosed unwitting participants with LSD in the 1950's MK Ultra project. They have already proven dangerous to U.S. citizens, why should we think otherwise? Other ""false flag"" and pretense operations include the sinking of the U.S.S. Maine (""Remember the Maine""), and a 2005 report showing that at least a second alleged attack against American destroyers at the Gulf of Tonkin, which propelled U.S. involvement into the Vietnam Civil War did not occur.

Theological philosopher David Griffin de-constructs long-standing American myths one at a time. That the U.S. Government is above reproach in approbate responses, like attacking Vietnam, Afghanistan or Iraq is one such myth. As a culture, we simply cannot get our minds around the possibility that our own government is often our adversary. Probably not so much at local government levels, but certainly at the highest levels.

So, Griffin debunks myths about the goodness of U.S. Government, and has done a fair amount of digging into evidence mysteriously avoided in the 9/11 Commission Report.

- NORAD issued three different explanations about whether they were or were not called by the FAA to track hijacked airplanes.

- Mysterious ""stand down"" orders from on high (re: Cheney's office), which permitted the planes to crash into the Twin Towers and the Pentagon.

- Mysterious spike of ""put option"" purchases on United Airlines, American Airlines and Morgan Stanley days before the attacks, suggesting that somebody knew in advance of impending attacks, and that whoever the purchaser was, they made tons of money off the subsequent falling stock values of those companies.

- Some double-talk by Cheney about when he was notified about hijackings, the startling revelation that George Bush's own brother was in charge of the company that oversaw security at the WTC.

- The impossible collapse of the Twin Towers, plus Tower No. 7, which must be recognized as a carefully orchestrated implosion. Griffin compares the collapse of the towers with other sky scrapers around the world that suffered much hotter fires for much longer periods, but the structures of which remained standing, even after floors collapsed. The Twin Towers had many steel core columns that should not have collapsed to what ended up being only a couple stories high of rubble.

Worse, a video of the collapse of Tower 7 shows a remarkably precise free fall. Yet, inexplicably, only a few floors were on fire. Some might say, ""oh, yeah, well the Twin Towers' structural integrity was compromised because they were hit by jets,"" but Tower No. 7 wasn't hit by a jet! Fire made it collapse? Incredible, in the most literal sense of the word.

One of the very few companies licensed for tactical implosion-type demolition made ""a tidy profit"" when they were hired to clean up the rubble. We'll never know why those monstrous steel girders collapsed because the steel was shipped overseas to be smelted. The forensic evidence was tampered with.

- A Sheraton Hotel and a CITGO gas station's surveillance cameras were confiscated by Gov. agents after the supposed plane crashed into the Pentagon. If it was a 757, like the Government is telling everybody, why can't we see those films? What's the big secret?

These are a few among many solid questions Griffin asks. His scathing indictment of the 9/11 Commission Report as being an inside job, with Phillip Zelakow, a long-time Administration friend and colleague as too closely affiliated with the Administration to provide impartial, penetrating guidance of investigations. Those investigations, by the way, were severely compromised, and the final report reads more like an appeasement, neatly tying together explanations to satisfy a war-hungry public.

And, war is just what the desired effect was. Getting back to my opening statements, the need for a Pearl Harbor-like attack was, Griffin conjectures, exactly what Empire expansion requires to mobilize public opinion to a war, the underlying purpose of which is fat private contracts and the securing of natural resources (read, ""oil"").

Griffin sprinkles many other unusual little tidbit mysteries throughout his presentation, which seemed to switch between two locations throughout the film, at The Commonwealth Club, San Francisco and The Grand Lake Theater, Oakland. He provided some comic relief, too, especially still shots of Cheney's ubiquitous snarl...He really does snarl!

- Found in the micro-pulverized rubble of the WTC was an intact passport supposedly belonging to one of the hijackers! The fire was supposedly hot enough to melt steel (which it wasn't, by the way), but a paper passport survived intact? Worse than incredible, scary. We don't know who to trust any more.

Griffin recognizes it is normal for citizens to think in patriotic terms. Most of us are patriots, he conjectures, and as such, we can barely conceive that our own Government (again, at the highest levels) would murder its citizens to start a war for commercial purposes. Yet, that seems to be exactly the case, and everything the President and Vice President have since done shows every indication that they are above the law, beyond the reach of Constitution or conscience.

By the way, much comment has been made on President Bush's facial gestures in that Florida school room when he was told of the attack. I personally don't see any clues in his look. To me, he looked worried and thoughtful, and that's about all I can deduce from his body language. A lot of people, including myself, when we first heard about the first plane crash didn't properly process that news.

Now, are there any weak spots in Griffin's analysis? I think there are. It's rather confusing and non-specific, but Griffin gives the impression that the hijackers were not necessarily who they were said to be. The ""planted"" passport in the WTC rubble, for instance; and that another of the named hijackers, Walid Al-Shiri turned up 11 days later in Morocco, where he worked as a pilot. During a Q&A session, Griffin answers, ""Do we know that?"" to one of the questions about Solicitor General Oleson's wife Barbara being on the plane that struck the Pentagon. He somehow implies that she might be elsewhere, alive, or who knows where, since it is his contention that a plane did not really hit the Pentagon.

Well, whether or not a plane really did hit the Pentagon, and whether or not Barbara Oleson was on that plane, we have pretty conclusive proof in the form of hundreds, if not thousands of eyewitness testimony, and amateur videos that planes hit the WTC towers. Those planes weren't flying themselves. There were people on those planes. There's a certain incongruity about being a skeptic about who the hijackers were, on the one hand, but knowing that there were hijackers, on the other. If the hijackers were not Mohammed Atta, et. al., then who? And why, if our government was complicit, would some men commit suicide, if not for ideological hatred of America? These are loose ends in Griffin's logic. I don't believe he should answer them just to make an elegant, persuasive polemic, because then he is guilty of the same transgression he accuses the 9/11 Commission of doing: Formulating an elegant and intuitively sensible story. If Barbara Oleson did lose her life on a hijacked plane, it might be seen as insensitive and irresponsible to imply she was ""in on it."" At one point Griffin even suggests that Flight 77 crashed in Tennessee, not the Pentagon. I don't think you can hide a crashed 757 in the Tennessee mountains for six years, but I might be guilty of falling for False Myth #3: ""Such a big plan could not have been kept a secret because so many people were in on it.""",1189814400,85,7721,5.01875

2788752,4,B000O0YV7O,"A somber approach to what is clearly defined ONLY as an argument for further investigation into the facts as presented to us by the 9/11 commission. This is not a sensationalist or gratuitous video serving up shock value for entertainment. Dr. Griffin spends the first 30-40 minutes simply laying out the groundwork for why YOU should at least question the 9/11 commision's conclusion. This is not some crazy tinfoil hat YouTube video.

Dr. Griffin, a theologian and author of 20+ other books not even related to 9/11 stands up what is for me one of the most rational and valid appraoches to the conspiracy theory moniker that's slapped onto anyone second guessing some or all of the commission's findings. Read the description again and judge for yourself but for me it did exactly what it said, that is it ""presents a case that leaves very little doubt that the attacks of 9/11 need to be further investigated.""

2788759,1,B000O0YV7O,"The speaker in this video claims to have EVIDENCE that those responsible for the attacks on the WTC on 9/11 were not the terrorists the government has named.  Never in this video does the speaker offer a single piece of evidence as to whom he purports to be the actual parties responsible for the destruction of the WTC.  He offers speculation and innuendo and snide jokes but NOT ONE SINGLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE.  Instead of presenting evidence he offers a critique of the 9/11 commission report, which is not evidence regarding other parties having committed this act, and engages in abject speculation about the actions and motives of government officials, which also is not evidence regarding other parties having committed this act.  He actually offers as evidence of a government plot to attack the WTC and blame it on foreign terrorists President Bush continuing to read to schoolchildren after being informed of the second impact at WTC.  He ignores the huge number of alternative explanations and posits only those contiguous with his conclusion.  Could it be that Bush was confused as to an appropriate action to take?  Could it be that Bush might have thought it best to leave the immediate response to local authorities and NORAD?  Could it be that Bush simply had no clue what he should do and just wanted to close his eyes and make it all go away until Uncle Cheney could make it better?  Who knows?  But it is interesting that the only possibilities the speaker allows for are those that support his conclusion while he offers ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE AT ALL to back his claims.  Those who may claim otherwise, who claim that he did offer evidence, will show that they clearly do not understand the difference between EVIDENCE and SPECULATION.  The speaker asserts, in the latter half of the video, that at least building 7 was brought down by controlled demolition and that the only possible evidence was to be found on the structural steel from the buildings that the government sent away to be melted.  The video does however show that the entire WTC area and more was covered in debris and dust which undoubtedly would have contained a significant amount of explosive residue and detonator debris had the assertions of the speaker held any merit.  Not only does the speaker fail to mention this possibility of inquiry but failed even to attempt to obtain this potential evidence.  The failures in logic and the equally gargantuan confirmation bias obviously at play in the speaker's mindset and presentation make this less a quest for truth and much more an obnoxious spectacle of Truther masturbation.

2788772,5,B000O0YV7O,"Griffin lays out the case for the 9/11 attacks being a false flag operation in great detail while pulling no punches. I would also recommend Griffin's ""9/11: Ten Years Later"" for a somewhat updated account. In a real sense, though, you don't need to buy books and DVDs to be convinced that the World Trade Center Towers and Building 7 were brought down by explosives that must have been planted months before by somebody other than Al-Qaeda. All you need to do is really look at videos of the buildings as they are coming down. Cement crumbles and cracks, but it doesn't pulverize unless it is reduced to talcum by extremely powerful explosives. Neither do computers or office furniture or human bodies. Really look at the Twin Towers coming down. Everything is pulverized from the top down, with steel beams shooting out horizontally as molten iron flows like a lava field. The roof of the Deutsche Bank nearby was coated in pulverized human bones. Jet fuel fires don't do that. Wake up, America! Wake up! And what should you wake up to? To the fact that the Bush Administration was evil? You would be justified, but doing that wouldn't be very productive. Widen your viewpoint. Start with the book ""The War against the New Deal"" by Brian Waddell. It turns out that 9/11 was merely the outgrowth of a movement that started during World War II, a movement to transform America into what Waddell calls a ""warfare state."" The military-industrial complex that President Eisenhower warned us about has been determining national policy from that day to this. Al-Qaeda is no longer a credible bogyman, so up pops ISIS, and when ISIS is gone, another ""terrorist"" organization will take its place as a pretext for military action and escalated levels of military spending. And if Americans become tired of it all, another false flag ""terrorist attack"" will be staged to keep America on a war footing while American bodies pile up and corporate profits continue to mount. Of course none of that could happen, if investigative journalism wasn't an oxymoron today. Guess who owns and operates the major news outlets.",1415059200,20,2105,4.866295264623956

My opinion was dynamite planted in the elevator shafts to ensure the towers would collapse along with not taking the threat seriously. Most of this documentary though is philosophical and hardly any facts. Check out Explosive experts speak out on Amazon prime video.,1515024000,,369,5.362068965517241
8182498,1,B000O0YV7O,"I immediately began to turn off when the speaker was introduced on the first DVD as a religious ""scholar,"" which is about as impressive a title to me as an expert on (insert your favorite here) comic book universe.  Worse, he states his specialty is in separating myth from truth, but religion and theism contain only myth.

These lectures are made worse by the lack of evidence.  Presumably the speaker showed a slide show at the lectures, both delivered in California to leftist audiences.  The videos were edited to add pictures of various people and objects.  As he speaks, he keeps talking about how dispassionate his analysis is, but his hatred of Bush and Cheney is evident in his speech, and every time Cheney is mentioned, the infamous ""sneer"" picture is displayed.  However, such pictures don't constitute evidence.  For instance, he claims a Bush brother and cousin owned the company responsible for security at the WTC (which had a 72-hour period where security was absent the weekend prior to 9/11), but his only evidence is a picture of the two of them jogging with Bush the Younger, not, say, a picture of the corporate ownership documents.  The only real evidence he presents is a PBS interview with Silverstein where Silverstein admitted deliberately demolishing WTC7.",1513814400,2,1285,4.97196261682243
8182499,5,B000O0YV7O,Great! I fully believe the conspiracy theories and this film went over facts and why  people don't want to believe them. Much easier to bury your head in the sand then face the truth. Good film.,1513555200,2,194,4.388888888888889
8182500,5,B000O0YV7O,"I found this presentation to be clear. Rational. Meticulous.  This speaker simply reiterated what anyone with common sense, education, and understands physics would ask.

The first thing that popped into my mind, when I watched the second plane crash into the remaining tower was,""where are the fighter jets???"" It was preposterous to me that any large plane, not on a proper approach to either La Guardia or JFK, would be allowed to approach NYC. Any pilot even of small planes, knows this. I am one of them.

Bush's vacuous face, sitting in a classroom, after 2 planes crashed, was unbelievable. I found it completely unbelievable that the Secret Service would not have rushed him out, to an undisclosed location.  IF this was unexpected.

Perhaps the most unbelievable, that Dr Griffin pointed out:

How on earth, short of controlled implosion could there be free fall destruction of these 2 giant towers? Anyone with a science background would laugh at the story proposed by the government.

Finally: I always ask: who benefited from this, in the short term and long term? These were clearly detailed by Dr Griffin.

As a patriotic American, questioning the intention of corrupt government officials and the Military-Industrial-Complex , which President Eisenhower asked his generation of Americans, and us (future generation) ...is in Itself a patriotic thing to do. In America we ask tough questions of our government, our media. We are not in Venezuela, Colombia, China, or Singapore. not yet.

To those who don't like this: believe what you wish. But do NOT deny those of us who like to question, who like to get believable answers, the right to do so. We ask these questions not just for ourselves, but you, our fellow Americans.",1512864000,7,1738,5.006944444444445

8182503,1,B000O0YV7O,"The production value is poor, his PowerPoint presentation is bias and poor, and the whole audience is bias. Not one person in the audience asked a question challenging his theories. And believe me they are theories. He offered no evidence to the accusations he made for over an hour. It took me 15 minutes of research to counter every single one of his accusations to be false. I mean he's asking ridiculous questions like how do we know she died,  we have no proof she died except the husbands word. I really expected the next words out of his mouth was ""Yes she probably went to a planet far far away and she's not dead at all."" If maybe he would actually look at the passenger manifest from the FBI and not CNN's list of victims he would see the terrorist names and he would see the
victims names. But I could go on and on about the claims he makes but I will waste no more time on his rhetoric. I'm just trying to warn people not to waste an hour and 41 minutes of your life watching this.",1511827200,,993,4.226315789473684
