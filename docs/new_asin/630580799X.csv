7895456,4,630580799X,"This is another silly Brigitte Bardot film where she plays a ditzy sex kitten.  The only reason to watch this film is for those occasions when she takes off her clothes.  Oh!  If you're a fan of Roger Vadim, you might also like this film.  At one point, Brigitte is the object in her co-star's dreamshe dances naked for him.  However, there's gauze or vaseline on the camera lens, and she's wearing a thin bodysuit.  The bodysuit is thin enough that her interesting bits show through, but I can tell it's there.",1376524800,,511,4.5
7895457,5,630580799X,"This is a little-known example of Brigitte Bardot's repertoire. But do you remember how much of an explosion she made on world filmography? In this one, she plays a classic crazy French gal having an impact upon those around her. Enjoy! There is a scene near the end which many male students waited for with bated breath.",1287014400,,321,4.649122807017544
7895458,4,630580799X,"""La bride sur le cou"" (""Please Not Now!"") is a pure joy to watch. Brigitte is sexy beyond compare, the plot is amusing (and sometimes very funny), and the story has some unexpected comical moments (e.g., the ""kitchen"" at the hotel).
I loved the opening sequence in which Sofie (Brigitte) is driving her Deux Chevaux through the streets of Paris, creating traffic mayhem in her wake. A creative mix of real time and sped-up photography, it's a comic gem that can't be missed. The Paris driving sequence foreshadows a ""cool"" moment later in the film where Sofie and two courting men race each other around bales of hay in karts, with the POV at ground level just a few feet in front of the karts.
Because it's a fantasy sequence, Brigitte's nude dance is seen through a glass haze. Enough clarity is seen to make it exciting without sacrificing taste. But what makes this sequence extraordinary is (1) the visual ""back and forth"" interplay of the la Bamba drummer, who dances while he plays, and Brigitte's strip tease, and (2) the accelerating rhythm of the music itself. I also enjoyed the fact that the director (Roger Vadim) chose to employ (literally) a visual metaphor--smoke and mirrors.
The film quality is excellent. The black and white photography is first rate, and Anchor Bay is to be commended for its transfer.
The subtitles are good, though, of course, it doesn't capture ever single word said in French. What does translate is Brigitte Bardot's sensual innocence and inimitable charm.",1078704000,22,1498,4.85546875
7895459,3,630580799X,"(Though it's only a matter of time before CONTEMPT is issued.)  I don't know why it's so hard to get a sex goddess into a great movie.  Billy Wilder managed it with Marilyn.  Poor Brigitte spent her early years on film saddled with empty froth and scripts aimed more at third-rate philosophy than genuine drama.  If not great, at least there's nothing in the way here of getting the full measure of this charming actress.  It's amazing how far a few seconds of nudity and a surpisingly joyfull riverdance through La Bamba goes to make the whole deal worthwhile.",985996800,10,561,4.626262626262626
7895460,2,630580799X,"Film  voir pour les fans de la belle blonde pulpeuse. C'est rafrachissant et lger  souhait, mais quelque peu dcevant pour le cinphile exigeant. Bon cinma quand mme! Les blondes n'y sont pas  l'honneur encore une fois.",978393600,4,217,4.972222222222222
