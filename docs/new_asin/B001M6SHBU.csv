3692783,3,B001M6SHBU,"The product description seems to portray ""Phantom Memory Kurau"" as a superpowered, sci-fi, action anime. But it really isn't. It's so much more than that.

The story follows Kurau, who is forever changed upon visiting the lab where her father works at a young age. Without revealing too much... After an accident at the lab, Kurau's body is inhabited by a strange being with amazing powers (like flying). Nobody is really sure as to how much of Kurau's self remains as this being inhabits her body. As the story jumps from Kurau's past to her present (around the year 2050 I believe) her younger self spawns from Kurau. The rest of the series surrounds Kurau as she is hunted by the GPO and tries to protect Christmas (her younger self) from them, while both Kurau and Christmas learn more about themselves and try to help others that are terrorized by the GPO.

This series, I believe, delves into and explores the human experience. Even though it is abstracted with science-fiction, superpowers, and beings from who-knows-where; ideas of family, love, alienation, and perhaps even self-identity come through as sincere elements of the story-- unlike in many other anime, where the emotional moments feel tacked-on and overplayed. The only problem I had with the series was that a few moments, and even a whole episode here or there, seemed out of place and a little too campy for the dramatic tone of the rest of the anime. That, and I wish that it had delved deeper into what seemed to be elements of finding wholeness within oneself. If you're signed up for Netflix, most of the series is online and can be streamed to be viewed instantly. If you enjoy anime with a more mature tone, I suggest you at least try a few episodes.

As an anime I believe it deserves 4 stars, but when compared to other movies and tv series I'd give it 3.",1238889600,6,1837,4.6461538461538465
3692784,5,B001M6SHBU,This series sucked me in and I like anime that does that. It made me want to see what would happen next. Well worth a look!,1352678400,,123,3.769230769230769
3692785,3,B001M6SHBU,"I had high hopes for Kurau and it started off well. The animation is very decent and the premise is interesting. However, I felt that the pace was just too sluggish, despite there being plenty of action. It is really hard to say why exactly this anime failed to captivate me. Perhaps the characters were a bit too... simplistic? Like they were given one role and only one throughout the entire film. Even though certain opinions changed they still seemed stuck in the same role.

Also, I contest the 'yuri' claims for this film. I am strictly opposed to yaoi/yuri content but I didn't get any yuri vibes from this anime. In fact, it was told right near the start that the relationship of Kurau and Christmas will be as sisters and to me that's all it seemed like they were - close sisters.

I have seen worse anime than this. I don't think I wasted my time finishing it. However, it really didn't leave much in the way of lasting impressions on me.

If you are looking for good science fiction anime, I recommend Toward the Terra, Noein or Gundam Wing. I know there are others out there, but these are the ones I have seen and enjoyed.",1337126400,,1135,4.421052631578948
3692786,5,B001M6SHBU,"As an affecting sci-fi action-drama with a strong emphasis on the importance of family and friends, Kurau: Phantom Memory has slowly developed into a sleeper favorite over the years.

This latest ""S.A.V.E."" release contains all 24 episodes with a solid English dub in 5.1 surround (and Japanese stereo), spread across 4 discs with some extras such as clean openings.  Importantly, the jarring lime-green S.A.V.E. banner can be dispensed with simply by reversing the cover art.  The reverse features a complete title on the spine and looks just like the initial cover art minus the banner.  The discs themselves feature nice printed art of individual characters. In order of discs: Kurau, Doug, Christmas, and Ayaka Steiger.

These characters represent the strongest elements of Kurau: Phantom Memory.  Be it the deeply bonded sisterhood of Kurau and the entity she names ""Christmas"" that is at the center of the series (Kurau sharing an existence with an internal ""Rynax"" energy being, and Christmas a complex being that is part-clone/part-alien ""Rynax"" externally nurtured by Kurau); to the unassuming competence and support of agent-for-hire Doug; or how antagonist Ayaka Steiger deals with a famous last name and tragic past.

Also interesting is the mix of locations and settings as government forces seek out Kurau and Christmas due to their Rynax background and powers. Intriguingly, both Kurau and Ayaka come from what were pointedly happy mixed-race families that also both happened to be torn by tragedy.  This becomes more than trivial when much of the series later shifts to the Swiss countryside, home to Kurau's family on her mother's side (her father Dr. Amami who oversaw the experiment which resulted in Kurau's accidental Rynax cohabitation tries to help from a necessary distance).

For her part, Ayaka is a lead government agent tasked with finding Kurau and Christmas--but also fixated on discovering what happened to her family in a tragic event, especially in light of her widely-respected father John Steiger, whose name carries great weight in government circles even a dozen years after his death.  And in yet another point of commonality with Kurau, for her own reasons she also never has the word ""Christmas"" far from mind.

Another important part of the mix that acts as a supportive catalyst to other characters is Doug.  Eventually helping Kurau and Christmas, he also happens to have been Ayaka's superior when in government service.  Recently divorced but always very close to his son Ted, he initially starts off at a distance, hired by someone to keep an eye on Kurau.

All of this is presented with what appears to be a very clean transfer of 6 episodes per disc, and with the aforementioned 5.1 surround English audio featuring solid to excellent performances led by Monica Rial as Kurau.  Kurau: Phantom Memory comes highly recommended to those who enjoy mature sci-fi anime.",1325462400,6,2912,5.1528662420382165

3692788,4,B001M6SHBU,"I've rated this to be 4 star for specific reasons.
The story-line of this anime is based on more emotional sci-fi then it is to action/adventure.
It has a unique twist in events that'll happen to a girl while going to see her father at work trying to develop a new source of energy.
Again, this is more of an emotional anime, not action. It does look like it'll be action packed but it isn't.
The soundtracks of this one are great imo. The price is low for all the episodes(24).
It isn't too great once you've seen the first few episode where things really start to slow down.
But the ending turned out what you'd never thought would've happened. Although it does show some clue as of what might.",1306800000,,696,4.361538461538461
3692789,5,B001M6SHBU,"The main sci-fi element of this show is the alien race ""rynax"", which are beings composed of energy that come in pairs. While they are abused as energy and soldiers and rogue rynax are considered threats, the series mainly focuses on the two main rynax characters; Kurau and Christmas. All the pairs of rynax have a loving bond somewhere between siblings and lovers, which is difficult to describe, but extremely moving. Other characters face their own problems dealing with different kinds of affection, most oftenbetween family, and how factors like death, rivalry, and duty affect them.
Compared to the nuanced relationships between the characters, the sci-fi elements can be a clunky; if you're the kind of person who treats Dune like soft-sore porn, this is not your show.
If you're looking for a show to affect you on an emotional level in an atypical way, buy this, although you'd probably be better off with the cheaper edition, since the slim DVD cases don't hold the DVD's well, and the plastic in the center is chipping, and while the covers and the discs look great and feel right, as far as the welfare of the discs are concerned, you'd be good either way.
Also, the dub is pretty high quality; this isn't an A-list dub, so there'll be a few awkward casting choices, (I didn't particularly like the father's voice), but the main cast is spot-on; the English Kurau is a much more sympathetic and emotionally nuanced character, but still tough as nails. (in the Japanese version, she sounds largely unaffected by most everything and a little over-calm, except when Christmas is involved, where she speaks normally; I understand where they were going with this, but the super-formal sentence structure of the sub translation doesn't quite match up with the English script for me)
This is very unorganized. Yeah. 5 stars, even though the packaging is pretty bad.
(also the music is freaking great and it's done by Bones, and the style just fits the show perfectly, and the pacing is really good, and the fight scenes are fun but not the center of the show, which is really how it should be, anyway, end review)",1297209600,5,2119,4.808219178082192
3692790,1,B001M6SHBU,"When she was 12 years old, Amami Kurau was involved in an accident in her father's lab on the Moon, that left her alive, but not herself. Kurau's body is now the home to an energy entity called Rynax. In order to protect her, Kurau's father sends her to Earth and claims that she died. Ten years later, Kurau is working as an elite mercenary, and is the creme de la creme of the crop. But Rynax are paired creatures, and Kurau's Rynax has been alone for a long time. Finally, after ten years of waiting, her partner is born - unfortunately for the two of them, Kurau's existence has been leaked to the government and now they are intent on hunting her down.

I watched this series because a friend of mine owned it. I read the description and thought ""Hey cool, a sci-fi mystery anime"" and agreed to watch it with him. In the beginning I enjoyed it a little, the mystery of the Rynax was interesting and seemed promising. But as the series progressed I realized with horror that it wasn't science fiction, it was a light yuri. While not a yuri fan, I could have put up with yuri in a Sci-Fi story, but I didn't want a yuri story with Sci-Fi elements. (Note: Yuri = girl-to-girl love)  I knew after the second disc that I didn't like this series, but I kept watching because I was curious. It wasn't worth it.
Christmas (Kurau's partner), looks to be about 14 and Kurau is 22. Fortunately, there is no physical contact between them besides lots of hugging, but their obsession with each other was downright annoying. Looking at it as a pair of bonded aliens makes it seem cool, until you are subjected to countless scenes of ""Christmas!"" ""Kurau!""""Christmas!""""Kurau!"" (repeat x100), that you just feel bored.

I just couldn't stand this series because the relationship between Kurau and Christmas annoyed the h*** outta me. Also, the characters themselves were really annoying. Kurau and Chirstmas didn't seem to exist outside of their relationship. I wasn't the only one who was annoyed either. I watched this with a guy friend and two sisters, and all of us hated it. The Sci-Fi elements are cool, there just isn't enough focus on them. The ending was well balanced. But there are many more much better series out there, don't waste your time with this one.

3692791,4,B001M6SHBU,"I'll keep this short - this is without a doubt the best anime I have seen to date (and I see a lot)
Fairly hard sci-fi background (which I appreciate), strong Yuri theme (ditto), Very high production quality, excellent voice casting for the dub, awesome soundtrack. This film is one of the few that reliably brings tears to my eyes.

The only thing I find imperfect is the ending is a bid weepy. The entire last episode is anticlimax. That's a Lot of resolution. I would have done it a bit differently.

3692792,4,B001M6SHBU,"This is a an anime that was done by Bones who also did Fullmetal Alchemist and still failry recently Xam'd: Lost Memories.  It is a story driven anime and moves to a pace similair to Ghost in the Shell.  A little girl goes to work with her father who is studying an alien life form and that life form escapes from the lab, however part of that alien gets trapped inside the little girl.  I don't want to give the story away, so I will stop there.

While Kurau is still human in apperance she is what they call Rynax. Rynax are a paired species but Kurau is alone. Fast forward ten years and even though her father insists she is dead some still believe Kurau is alive.
 Kurau coulb be perceived a gender confused boy which adds to a mature theme. She is not the busty type of woman that alot series have. You will not find the fan service type of anime here.
 I found this an interesting series and was glad I bought it but the replay value is not the greatest. I did like the fact that it is Thin-Pack but I do not care for Full Screen yet I bought it anyway.

8320597,5,B001M6SHBU,"I watched this anime 7 years ago on Netflix and final decided to own it. It real is a wonderful story with a great deal of emotional depth, few other anime's have caught me emotional like this one. The main character Kurau is a renax an alien from another dimension, they are small beings with consciousness but exist as energy. They exist as binary pairs and can only exist if there pair is with them. The two help to stabilize one another's exist. The problem is renax cannot exist in the human world unless they inhabit a body. Kurau is a human girl who accident gets possessed by a renax during an experiment conducted in a lab by her father. In the series it explores relationships. The one Kurau the alien has with her pair Christmas, her father (Kurau the human's father) as he attempts to return his daughter back to not normal and the relationship renax have with humans. The series is very good in exploring the depth of what people will due to protect what they love and the sacrifice that are made to achieve such goals. All in all Kurau phantom memory's in my opinion is one in a short list of great anime that was created in the early 2000's.",1489190400,,1156,4.406542056074766

To many people, this series may seem bland(as it doesn't seem to have a lot of story and isn't the typical romantic or comedy theme many see in today's animes), but to me it was very emotionally gripping as all the protagonist wants to do is to live peacefully with her pair but with all of these organizations getting in the way, it's more likely for either of them to die, leaving the other pair crazy with extreme loneliness only pairs can feel.

But it certainly isn't boring. Great characters, with better than average artwork and animation. The CGI especially deserves a good study by students of the animated arts. What is amazing to me though is the  writing, There were so many places that this series could have jumped the shark with smaltz. Sometimes it toes the line, but ultimately there becomes this melding of sweetness and toughness in many of the characters that becomes satisfying in the end. Give Kurau a watch. She and Christmas will remain on your memory for days to come.",1375747200,,717,4.925619834710743
