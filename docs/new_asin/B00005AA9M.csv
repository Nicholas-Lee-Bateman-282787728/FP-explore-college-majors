7935175,5,B00005AA9M,"Many of us have seen the VH1 show Behind the Music. Well this is music that some people think sucks. Featuring Dr. Dre, Eminem, LL Cool J, Limp Bizkit, Insane Clown Posse, Puff Daddy, 2-Pac, Kid Rock, and Will Smith. Personally I think the 2-Pac parody is the funniest one. It is a parody of John F. Kennedy's assasination. Dr. Dre has a parody of Peanuts which is very funny with him as Charlie Brown, Suge Knight as Lucy, and Snoop Dog as Snoopy the Dog. All the parodies are very halarious.",1007856000,4,493,4.369565217391305
