8463901,4,B005BCE75G,"This film is a story of a girl who deals with life in a 1970s commune.  She struggles to make sense of the free love, nudity, and unorthodox living of her parents.

8463906,4,B005BCE75G,"Consult IMDB for the plot. This was a very offbeat movie that kept me guessing. I never knew what to expect next. I grieved for the child and the neglect and hardships that were thrust upon her by thoughtless self-absorbed parents. The bohemian lifestyle was difficult to adjust to. I kept correcting the adults in my mind when they made mistakes in judgment and proper parenting. Karo is a lovely child and a likable character. I empathized with her dilemma and was stunned by her ignorance of animal biology. 'Nuff said.

Good movie. Just NOT for those of Victorian or Christian values. Much nudity, 'free love', sex and such.",1392508800,4,628,4.761467889908257
