1803389,5,B00007AJDO,"This series was based upon the classic Louisa May Alcott book ""Little Men"".  Although it does move away from the book in certain ways, the series still brings the charm of Alcott's novel to the small screen.  The scripts are well written, the acting superb, and the stories are timeless.  This DVD, containing the first 4 episodes of the series, will be something to treasure and which can be shared with children and adults alike for many years to come.",1055462400,18,454,4.65
1803390,5,B00007AJDO,I found this show on one of my digital cable stations while just flipping stations and was hooked after watching just one episode. I was very excited to find this type of show since I have missed Dr. Quinn Med Woman. This show is great for families as well with a little drama and comedy. I was also very happy to find out that it was being released on DVD. Now we all can enjoy it even if they stop showing it on cable. I definately recommend this DVD.,1047081600,9,453,4.101123595505618
1803391,5,B00007AJDO,"I watched this when it was on the PAX channel, and my whole family enjoyed it!  It is a charming series, which includes romance, adventure, humor, a great cast, great clothing, and more!  Based loosely on the Louisa May Alcott novel of the same name, it is a fun series you should enjoy whether you've read the books or not.

There are a few episodes I didn't care for (the Halloween episode, etc.), the very occasional swearing, and a few bits in which lying wasn't discouraged as it should have been, but overall it's good.

These first four episodes are very sweet and satisfying. . . . ""Changes"" introduces Nick Riley, the new caretaker, and the first girl student, Nan.  ""Quarantine"" is about the measels epidemic that keeps the school under a quarantine, and the bravery of those willing to do what they could to help (a very touching episode).  In ""Thanksgiving,"" Bess (Amy & Laurie's daughter) arrives at the Plumfield school.  Will Bess ever be happy at Plumfield?  In ""Tough Crimes"" an old friend of Dan's decides he wants to take Dan out West with him--but at what cost?

I wish the whole series were on DVD!",1042502400,9,1119,4.611111111111111
1803392,5,B00007AJDO,"I watched the TV series Little Men when it was played on PAX TV a few years ago, and was very disappointed when they took it off the air. It was the first show I ever saw that had valuable lessons, but never anything harmful for young children to see. Although I always enjoyed Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, some episodes were inappropiate for young children, never so Little Men.
Anyone that views this show (and is a fan of the 1800s) will undoubtedly enjoy it immensely.",1041465600,13,470,4.476744186046512
1803393,5,B00007AJDO,"I watched ""Little Men"" for 2 years on PAX TV when it originally aired and fell in love with this delightful, heartwarming family drama.  Safe for the entire family to enjoy, ""Little Men"" will warm your heart with valuable lessons, charming anectdotes, and a house of boys and girls tumbling through life's many adventures.
In addition to the rambunctions children of the series, is the burgeoning relationship between Jo Bhaer and the new caretaker of Plumfield, Nick Riley.  After the unexpected death of her husband Fritz, (which may alarm many L.M. Alcott fans) Jo finds herself torn between her past and her future.  The addition of Nick Riley to the story-line, though a major change in the original plot of the novel, is pivotal to the series.  He adds the charm, roughness, and tenderness of a man wrestling with his own past as he quickly falls in love with a woman of strength and courage unlike any he has ever known.
Anyone who purchases this series on DVD (the first 2 include the first 4 episodes) will undoubtedly enjoy it....",1040342400,35,1040,4.761111111111111

1803430,5,B00007AJDO,"My wife and I just discovered this gem of a series.  There are so few things worth seeing on TV these days.  This is first quality entertainment, teaches good values and we both have shed tears more than once watching it.  Something worthwhile for the entire family.  What do I like least?
That there are only two seasons to watch!",1512950400,2,331,4.466666666666667
1803431,5,B00007AJDO,I loved this series. Too bad it was canceled in 1999. I would have loved to enjoy several more seasons. Lots of great meaningful stories. There were two episodes that are not titled correctly.  The last two on season 2 are switched. So watch episode 13  and then episode 12.  And also episodes 8 & 9 titled wrong too.,1510272000,,317,4.338983050847458
1803432,5,B00007AJDO,"I loved this series. Characters are well-developed and good acting. Many life principles can be learned from the show. The writers did a very good job of putting this together. Their are funny moments, trial times and good family times. A well-rounded series that can be watched with the whole family.",1509840000,2,301,4.921568627450981
1803433,5,B00007AJDO,"This was quality TV programming!  I'm very disappointed that there was no season 3, 4, or 5.  I would have been a faithful fan and viewer!  A great cast with entertaining family oriented viewing. ( Note though that the last few episodes of Season 2 have wrong titles.)",1509235200,,268,4.541666666666667
1803434,3,B00007AJDO,"I watched both seasons, and it was okay, but nothing spectacular. I won't be adding it to my film collection. The writing is poor, and the acting is sometimes good and sometimes not so much. It is like someone tried to write a show with moral lessons, without understanding morality, wrote about family, without ever having a family, etc. The elements were - off. The role of Nick was badly cast or badly acted, and he did not fit with the character of Jo. Instead of a man with worldwide, real life experience but no formal education, Nick was played as goofy and stupid. We are told the character is one thing, but it is acted completely different. Nick hits a man to defend a bloody and battered child, but goes to jail, and is ever after referred to as a ""felon"". Even the people who care about him and saw what happened consider him a ""criminal"" over the incident, and yet the man who beat the child was NEVER jailed or punished. Nick hits a man to defend a woman who is beaten into a coma, A COMA, by her husband. Again, the man is never punished or jailed, but Nick is punished and labelled as a violent criminal as a result. This is just a tiny example of the twisted morality of this show. Stupid stuff like this is in every single episode, and it is beyond annoying. I watched it once, but I have no desire to watch it again.",1509148800,,1335,4.280632411067193
1803435,4,B00007AJDO,Too bad there wasn't a season 3.  It would have been fun to see some of the kids graduate and see where they head off too.  Good family entertainment.,1508198400,,150,4.137931034482759
1803436,5,B00007AJDO,I love this show. It's not overly cheesy & good for the family. I watched it as a kid and now I'm rewatching it as an adult and I'm loving it even more.,1508112000,2,152,3.6363636363636362

1803449,4,B00007AJDO,"Really wished there had been more seasons. The writing got a little bit 'off' in some episodes of the second season, a bit stretched. But all in all, a good, uplifting show to watch with all ages together. Really glad it's on Amazon Prime. Thank you, Amazon!",1507766400,,258,4.51063829787234

It's funny, dramatic, romantic, very family friendly.",1421884800,,370,4.888888888888889
1803454,5,B00007AJDO,Ive watch Little. Men and the thing that I like is that in every episode you have a set of life values they also show that woman are have the rigjt to do anything that the boys do. Michelle Rene Thomas portrayal of Jo Bhaer. Is riveeting . She has an understanding of the childrens every day struggle with life . I have been looking i want to buy all 26 episodes and cant find them all.  The other thing is the story of Jo and Nick they are supportive of each other on a daily bases . The kids learn what is right and wrong and how to deal with the decisions. that they make. Each ephisode is another adventure for the kids. Jo and the kids are like a real family careing about each other and how they feel. Nick takes on the character of dad when the kids look up to him.,1409443200,,772,3.9806451612903224

My own fault - I should have read the reviews better but I figured ""Set 1"" was the same as Season 1 which has THIRTEEN episodes.  The series is awesome, but it's really a bummer to only get four episodes for the price - even a used set at that.  The seller was fine but it's sad that it was packaged this way.",1398038400,2,358,3.9444444444444446

1803492,2,B00007AJDO,"I was disappointed in the CD set.  I spent $49.00 on a used set and only got 4 episodes.  The episodes were good, but I was disappointed that there were not more episodes for the LARGE cost of the CD's.  Plus I thought it was at least two seasons since the cost was so high!!Largely disappointed!!

1803493,5,B00007AJDO,"So very happy to have discovered this series. Have watched the 26 episodes (some more than others beginning in February) repeatedly on Netflix. I've never been so enamored with a series. Very unfortunate that so many members purchased the DVD's and were disappointed, certainly would have felt the same.

The story was so wholesome, charming, full of adventure, humor and a very sweet blossoming romance between Jo and Nick. It really has so much to offer, even for the book fans, who wouldn't feel betrayed by giving it a chance.

The addition of Nick Riley as caretaker of Plumfield is crucial to the series. He is a man struggling with his own past but brings his own brand of fortitude, charm, masculinity and tenderness to the storyline. Jo has strength and courage that Nick has ever known. Yes, he falls in love with her but never waivers from respect/admiration. In fact he becomes her savior in many ways (including her life). They really learn valuable lessons from each other.

The acting was superior by all players. Did not want it to end, would love to own the entire series, will never get tired of watching it. Although the climax was positive it would be great if the story could be continued.

FYI: MY REVIEW IS REGARDING THE STORY ONLY!! HAVE NOT PURCHASED THE DVD.

Someone mentioned be able to view 40 plus episodes. If anyone has info please add your comments.",1331683200,2,1382,4.717842323651452
1803494,5,B00007AJDO,"Little Men is my all-time favorite television show. While the series differs from the book in notable ways--especially that Dr. Bhaer is dead and replaced by hunky Nick to be Jo's romance--once you get past that, you can't help but love this show, and both Michelle Renee Thomas and Spencer Rochfort are great in the roles of Jo and Nick. And all the rest of the cast is fantastic as well. In fact, I have tried to follow all the casts careers--Corey Sevier and Robin Dunne especially have had significant careers. I read and loved Alcott's book as a boy but after watching the series I think it's actually an improvement on the book - something I have never said about any other book and movie/TV series.

When this show was on PAX I taped every episode. My VHS copies are now old and worn out and I wish the entire series would be brought out on DVD. I can't tell you how much I love this show. To be a kid at Plumfield has to be one of the happiest experiences imaginable, and I was highly invested in all of the characters. This series knows how to get into your heart and stay there and every episode succeeds. The Christmas episode in the first season is a particular favorite of mine, but there isn't a bad one in the entire series.

Bring out the entire series on DVD! Even with the full 26 episodes, you won't be able to get enough.

1803495,1,B00007AJDO,"I couldn't believe how much they deviated from Louisa May Alcott's characters and story line. To begin with, Jo was not a widow! Her husband was a very important character and a big part of the school. Meg's two older children, twins, Demi and Daisy attended Plumfield. There was no measles epidemic, no child died in their care. Amy and Laurie's daughter, Bess, was 3 years old and never attended Plumfield, but when she visited the kids adored her because she was so sweet and beautiful. There were enough interesting plots in the book to draw from without making such huge changes. The love story between Jo and her husband was actually very interesting.  They could have done flashbacks to how they met. It was a shame to leave out the example of a beautiful, lasting marriage just for the sake of making a possible love interest out of a handyman. It lost the point that some of the kids who didn't have parents found new ""parents"" at Plumfield. They cheapened and dumbed down the story.",1308182400,9,992,4.636363636363637

1803504,5,B00007AJDO,"I can't say enough about this series that unfortunately ran for only 2 seasons.  I recently bought this two DVD set of the first 4 episodes, and the picture & sound quality are excellent.  This series is well acted with good stories appropriate for the whole family.  Although it is an extention of LM Alcott's work and includes invented characters such as Nick, the romantic interest for Jo, it seems realistic and in keeping with the flavour that Miss Alcott was trying to portray through her writings.  The romance between them is very sweet and is in no way ""over the top"".  It isn't one of those productions that leaves purists such as myself feeling betrayed by the presentation of the story or characters, and now I wouldn't want to be without those new characters!  My favourite actors are Trevor Blumas who plays Nat and Robin Dunne as Franz Bhaer.  The DVD includes bios of some of the characters and also there are extra features for those who have a DVD-ROM.  It is interesting to note that one of the executive producers, Carl Binder, (who also produced Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman for 3 years), is Canadian as well as most of the actors/actresses.  It seems to be a joint production between Canada and the United States.  It is very much in the flavour of other outstanding Canadian productions such as Road to Avonlea by Sullivan Entertainment.  Those of you who like those shows will definitely like this as well.  I was also amazed when reading the bios, how much the teenagers have in common with one another in real life.  They are a very athletic and musical group of individuals.  Together they made an excellent team in this outstanding family show.  My biggest disappointment of course is that there are not more episodes available on DVD.  I'm presently ordering copies of this release for my friends.  I am hoping that since this DVD set was just released last year (2003) there is still a chance that they will release the rest.  I hope the producers are reading this!!

I then shared it with other family members and they all thoroughly enjoyed it.
