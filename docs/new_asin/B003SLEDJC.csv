4188612,4,B003SLEDJC,"This is a re-write. My previous review [of this title] got 40 favorable votes
out of fifty... it was, obviously, TOO detailed [long].
I STILL say, the best feature of this set is the reunion movie. Granted most
of the folks IN it are now dead, but for nostalgia-sake, it is a must-have.
A few of these episodes are cut. One, very badly -- for copyright reasons.
To see the complete/unedited [songs] in THE DARLING'S ARE COMING, you would
have to supplement this with

At THAT price range you just MIGHT get whatever is laying on the shelf. I have
read the reviews; some folks get the 16 {public domain} episodes on 1; 2; 3; or
as many as F-I-V-E DVDs. I bought one, each, of the different sets -- that SAY
it's TWO DVDs: one was two, the other one. I kept the one that had one of my
favorite blue-grass songs in it: SALTY DOG in the Darlin' Family episode.
I gave the oher to the local LIBRARY... you get what you PAY for -- the library is
FREE!

Love THAT song. You won't get that song/episode in its entirety unless you buy
one of these. I might add, one of the sets had ALL the original songs and THEME
music. Check it out!",1286841600,4,1538,5.351239669421488

4188666,5,B003SLEDJC,"The Andy Griffith Show 50th Anniversary: The Best of Mayberry

The Andy Griffith Show had so many excellent episodes that picking a group of the Best would be daunting for anyone, especially when the list is limited to only 17, as this one is.
However, I think this collection falls notably short. It left out two of the best Aunt Bea episodes, three truly classic Otis episodes, a couple of the funniest Barney episodes and the hilarious episode guest starring Barbara Eden as the runaway manicurist. But the worst oversight of all is the omission of the episode in which Freddy Fleets club band masquerades as the Mayberry town marching band so the mayor will approve them going to the state band competition. There are a few other episodes which (imo) could easily replace a couple of the ones they chose.
But its still vintage Mayberry and many, many folks will undoubtedly enjoy it.",1425340800,3,887,4.759740259740259

I have seen every episode so many times I know them by heart through the decades. I bought all the seasons of the series and the movie too. Many of the reunion DVD's and specials. My favorite character was Miss Crump and I know she wasn't many people's favorite but I loved her and Opie. Aunt Bee and Floyd were crack ups. This series is still on today and shown all over the world, I always stop and watch when it is on TV and every so often pull out my dvd's and go back to a simpler time when life didn't seem so harsh and bad. I always laugh along with Barney, Andy, Goober and Gomer the entire gang brings so much laughter the double dates with Thelma Lou and Helen. Great for the entire family and still holds up today as great quality program. There are not enough stars for this show five is not enough. A lot of the regulars had passed away by the time this movie was made and released but it is still good and brings back so many memories. Wish they had spent more time on Andy, Barney, Thelma Lou and Helen in this one.

4188693,5,B003SLEDJC,"The Andy Griffith Show like most episodic television could be a little uneven at times which is what makes a ""Best Of"" collection so desirable.  Everyone will have their own list of what should have been included, but there is enough great stuff here I can't imagine there would be to many complaints.  Added to the classic episodes are two noteworthy items  First is the original pilot as aired on ""The Danny Thomas Show"".  Although there are noticeable differences from the resulting show it does satisfy your curiosity about how it all began.  Finally, there is the reunion movie ""Return To Mayberry"" filmed almost 20 years after the original series left the air.  Most all the original actors are here as well as a lot of behind the scenes crew from the classic era. Its an above average movie, but most of all it includes that final scene of Andy and Barney in uniform lowering the US flag at the center of town as seen from a distance while we the viewer listen to the familiar whistle of the theme song.

4188700,5,B003SLEDJC,"This DVD set has 17 All Time Favorite Episodes of The Andy Griffith Show, and I bought it despite already owning all of them on previous season sets.  Why?  For two simple reasons:  the shows true pilot, which was an episode of The Danny Thomas Show, and the Return to Mayberry TV movie from 1986.  In my opinion, these bonus features alone were worth every penny.

I remember seeing the Danny Thomas episode long ago on TV, only to never run across it again.  Having it now on DVD is a real treat, as this is the true birth of the show.  Even though Frances Bavier played a slightly different character from Aunt Bee and Opie was a bit more rambunctious, and Andys somewhat more morally ambiguous, its a thoroughly entertaining look at the origin of the show.

As for the movie, its a fantastic nostalgia trip to the wildly successful reunion that was a ratings smash.  Most of the characters still living at the time show up, from Gomer and Goober to Barney and Thelma Lou, not to mention Ernest T. Bass, Otis, the Darlings, and Howard Sprague.  Youll also notice several of the familiar faces of former extras and bit players from the show, making the movie a fun way to remember the shows glory days.

Whether you have the regular episodes in this set or not, Id advise picking this up if you're a fan of the show.  Having the pilot and reunion movie is wonderful, and Im overjoyed they were finally made available.  I think they mightve done  better selling this if it had just been released as the movie, with the Danny Thomas episode as a special feature.  Rest assured, though,  if youve ever been a fan of The Andy Griffith Show, you're going to want to have this.  Its a welcome and much appreciated release.",1385683200,,1718,4.472668810289389

reunion movie ""Return To Mayberry"".  I thought the producers of this DVD did a first rate job in selecting some
of the best shows from the series.  In 2012 we lost not only Andy, but George Lindsey (Goober), and the great
banjo player Doug Dillard (of the Darling family). It was great seeing them all in both the series shows and in the
silly but spirited ""Return To Mayberry"".",1356998400,2,487,4.4

Citizen's Arrest, etc. BUT, the real Bonus is on Disc 3, the classic 1986 Movie, ""Return to Mayberry"". The one with the Monster in Myers Lake, when Andy and Helen return to Mayberry for him to run as Sheriff again, only to find Barney Fife also on the ticket for Sheriff of Mayberry. This is the VERY Best of TV. Shows like this are once in a Lifetime. This DVD will take You back to those Glory Days of Mayberry, and the USA !!",1347321600,2,577,4.115044247787611

4188728,5,B003SLEDJC,"I was born and raised in Germany and still live there. But in 2007 I got the chance to go to the U.S. for four years to work there for my company.

One day I was zapping through the channels and suddenly I stopped because I thought I had just seen ""Matlock"" as a young man. There he was, Andy Griffith in black and white and sooooo young. I wondered because in Germany he is only known as Matlock, who is grey-haired and old already. The Andy Griffith Show has never been published (aired) in Germany or anywhere in Europe as far as I know. I did't know that Andy Griffith had a career before ""Matlock"".

I was done zapping and watched The Andy Griffith Show for a while and I really liked it. Soon I set up my VCR to record all episodes. I was simply hooked! Of couse I bought all my favorite 5 seasons over Amazon already, I really don' t like the colored ones and I miss Barney there, just isn't the same anymore. I wonder if Don Knotts ever regret to part from the show?

I find it amazing that I became such a huge fan, I mean I didn't grow up in the States, I don't know anything about the Sixties and the American lifestyle and mentality back then, but to me it is the most wonderful tv - series for the whole family, a treasure, just timeless! I would move right into Mayberry if I could!

My stay in the U.S. was in the South so I got used to the accent very well, however I cannot share my obsession for this tv - show with anyone of my friends or family here in Germany because the Southern accent is just too difficult to understand for them and there is no German language (synchronisation) available and never will be. I understand about 90 % of what they are saying and I wish there would be subtitles available since we don't have CC in Germany. At least then I would be able to read the words that I don't understand and then get the meaning or look them up.

So you guys here are the only ones who understand my passion!
I bought this DVD only because of the reunion movie, I had never seen it before. Love it!

Unfortunately, Andy Griffith died last week, so I guess only Ron Howard is left.

  '''' R.i. P. Andy Griffith ''''

and thanks for hours and hours of your everlasting and never dying work that (now thanks to Paramount) will be in our living rooms as long as we live!

4188729,5,B003SLEDJC,"I received the sad news of Andy Griffith's death this morning. It was as though a close friend had passed away. Like so many other viewers, ""The Andy Griffith Show"" has had a way of making me feel like a part of it. Mayberry and the familiar characters and places make it a town just about everyone would like to visit...or maybe live. There's a familiar comfort that abides there and beckons us from our world of strife and stress. I can think of no other television program that is so satisfying and easy to identify with. Indeed, Andy Griffith (Sheriff Taylor) will be deeply missed. As will all of the others who have passed on.

As for this fine collection of programs and extras, ""The Andy Griffith Show 50th Anniversary: The Best of Mayberry"" is something every true fan of TAGS will want in their collection. Even if you own the entire series it's nice to have many of the best in one small package. These are the shows that can be watched over and over again without growing old. There's no need for me to describe each one. If you're a fan, you know them. The TV movie ""Return To Mayberry"" is especially nice. If any television program was worthy of a reunion, this one was.

So, get it as a perfect introduction to ""The Andy Griffith Show"" or just to celebrate one of the finest shows to ever appear on a television screen. One thing's for sure...you'll leave Mayberry with many happy memories.

Best wishes,
Frank",1341273600,,1425,4.494208494208494
4188730,4,B003SLEDJC,"I love the collection of shows on the DVD. They are in the original format AS they were shown back in the 60's, commercial spots and all...which is AWESOME! You never see Andy and Opie walking BACK from the fishing hole!!! It great. It also has a bit of trivia before each show. The downer is that they don't auto play or play all option. You must select each show to play. It's inconvenient but not enough to trade it in. That is why I gave it 4 instead of 5.",1334880000,4,460,4.065934065934066

4188732,3,B003SLEDJC,"While this 50th anniversary collection is fine, and I certainly enjoyed many of the original sponsor spots, the lack of a PLAY-ALL feature means that you can't just turn on the DVD and let it go.  You must start each episode individually.",1327708800,7,238,4.666666666666667
4188733,5,B003SLEDJC,This is a great sampler of one of television's greatest shows.  All eps are fantastic and provide a great overview of the shows B&W years.  All eps have Barney.  The original ads by Andy and Opie are included.  Picture and sound are great.,1318550400,,239,4.488372093023256
4188734,5,B003SLEDJC,"I absolutely love the episodes included in this commemorative set of dvds. There's no question that the Andy Griffith Show is one of the greatest TV series of all time. The brilliant scripts, endearing characters and flawless performances still resonate today. One can't watch an episode of Andy Griffith and not feel more optimistic about the day ahead or laugh at some slight from the day before or rejoice in the gift of family and friends that we take for granted. Indeed, the Andy Griffith Show itself is a gift to all of us - race, gender, ethnicity, religion - they are all transcended in these wonderful episodes that delve into the common human values that bind us together. But this set gives us more than landmark episodes. The Mayberry Reunion TV movie is also included, and it is a gem! Seeing everyone 25 years later felt like coming home after a long absence to find that Mayberry is still there with all its charm and simplicity, even though folks have grown up or moved on or paased away. This is a dvd set that I will cherish and revisit and share with others for a long time to come.",1314835200,3,1102,4.515
4188735,5,B003SLEDJC,"The Andy Griffith Show is one of those timeless shows whose appeal spans generations. I've loved it ever since the late 60s when my grandmother would give my cousins and I bowls of Frosted Flakes to enjoy with the show.

This set has most of the classics (""The New Housekeeper""-the show's official debut and the Ellinor Donahue eps from 1960 are MIA, but are available elsewhere). The great ""Mr. McBeeVee,"" the heartwarming tale of Andy dealing with his son's imagination is here, as is a similarly moving ""Opie The Birdman."" If you're a fan, you know about these eps. If not, be prepared for some excellent television. These two are widely considered to be the best of the series.

The belly laughs are also present with Barney and the choir (the lip synching scene is one of the funniest in television history), Gomer and Goober, Ernest T. Bass, and the Darling Family. The story of Barney Fife being kidnapped by the gangstresses is one that I do not recall seeing as a child (and I thought I've seen them all), but is a real gut-buster of belly laughs with a swell surprise ending.

""Return to Mayberry"" (1986), was the last hurrah for the gang while most of them were still alive nearly twenty years after the end of the initial series. Overall, a dreary affair, closer in spirit to the mawkish shark-jumping episodes of 1965-68 that are fortunately absent here than the series' classic years that this collection spotlights. However, the scene where Thelma Lou comes across Don Knotts/Barney Fife dressed as a circus clown entertaining some schoolchildren is one of Don Knotts' best moments ever captured on film, in my opinion.

The episode of the Danny Thomas show that introduced the Andy Griffith show characters (from around 1959-60) is fascinating. I hazily recall seeing this as a child. Anyway, this shows Andy as almost closer to the Bull Connor prototype of crooked Southern sherrifs (as often shown on the news in real life at the time) as he appears to unjustly persecute Danny Thomas (although in fairness, Thomas' character baits Andy with rural slurs such as ""Clem, ""hayseed,"" etc.). But when Opie enters, the sympathetic Andy Taylor we all know and love emerges.

The actual commercials with the characters hawking the General Foods products adds a nice touch of period charm, as do the appearances of Griffith and Knotts on some variety shows of the era in the special features.

The Alpha and Omega of an American institution. Enjoy.",1309219200,56,2457,4.838095238095238

THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW was spearheaded by its namesake's amiable, problem solving SHERIFF TAYLOR, DON KNOTTS' hyperkinetic deputy BARNEY FIFE, and ANDY's sensible son OPIE, played by the most natural child actor ever, RONNY HOWARD. The large cast of eccentric inhabitants included befuddled barber FLOYD LAWSON, moonshine magnet OTIS CAMPBELL, who had his own jail cell reserved for Saturday nights, and the one and only GOMER ""Goll-eeee!"" PYLE. Utilized more sparingly were hilarious backwoods characters such as rhyming rock-thrower ERNEST T. BASS and the bluegrass-addicted DARLING FAMILY, as well as the city-fied, hopelessly irrepressible FUN GIRLS, all quite capable of stealing a scene from even DEPUTY FIFE. The first five seasons of TAGS (in glorious, ""old-timey"" black & white) are all well worth owning, but this 50TH ANNIVERSARY roundup is ever' bit as satisfying as one of AUNT BEA's famous Sunday dinners.

4188743,5,B003SLEDJC,"""Return To Mayberry"" reunion movie is now available on DVD for T.V. fans of the show who didn't want to invest in the complete series package.  It's great to see the old cast together (Andy, Barney, Opie, Helen, Thelma Lou, Gomer, Goober, Howard, The Darlings, Otis and Ernest T.)  one last time.  The ending brings back a spirited feeling to what was America's finest small fictional town.  Excellent transfer. For those wondering about Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier), she was too ill to be involved in the reunion..... The best of selected episodes serve as a highlight overview to the prime early years.  There's plenty of Aunt Bee, Floyd the quirky  barber and other characters in those episodes who helped evolve the sitcom into the idea of a collected team effort led by well liked Andy Griffith. In supporting roles I always had a high opinion of Goober who was the best replacement on a T.V. sitcom this side of Mt. Pilot. (I couldn't imagine anybody else running the gas station after Gomer Pyle got his own popular series).  My other choice was dramatic Thelma Lou who strongly supported fumbling Barney Fife.  Andy, Helen, Barney and Thelma Lou had some hilarious times as a foursome in restaurants, the squad car and home life.  The Black and White Seasons are second to none in comedy/drama television - i.e.  ""Barney's First Car"", ""Fun Girls"" and ""Mr. McBeevee"".  For those who want a different view of the reunion movie after watching it in color, change the  your screen to Black and White.  The results might surprise you.",1295568000,5,1534,4.787072243346008

4188746,2,B003SLEDJC,"nice collection with extras but those thinking the darlings are coming episode to be complete, its not, for this new best of set rumors spread that it might be restored but ho hum its not,  yes the video has been mastered to mint better then the previous inclusion on the 3rd series set  but still missing scenes, music and dialogue are not here .......  1- denver pyles /driscol darlings conversation with sheriff andy taylor/andy griffith over daughter charlenes wild  attraction to the sheriff while filling the hillbilly flatbed truck with water in the mayberry town square as the darlings /the dillards look on is gone!  the lines were- aside from myself and her brothers, theres no other fellows on the mountain for her to play with!  so she finds the sherriff refreshing according to her father  why is this cut, who knows i presume paramount finds it taboo! unreal!  2- the entire salty dog tune sung by charlene and played by everyone including sherriff taylor sitting in and strumming along after dinner in the jailhouse cell is gone! thankfully the cindy oh cindy tune at the end of the show has been left intact  -  pick up the public domain dvds of andy griffith to find the complete episode as originally aired and presented , its not remastered but still very presentable for diehard TAGS fans!  shame on paramount for this!  otherwise this would be a five star review !",1293580800,25,1385,4.725
4188747,5,B003SLEDJC,I have never bought all of the Andy Griffith Show DVD's. I have a couple and this is the perfect compliment to my later color episodes. It has great features and is worth every penny....$$$ great deal.,1293580800,3,201,4.45945945945946
4188748,5,B003SLEDJC,"This collection of best shows about Mayberry was excellent.  We watched some of
them on Christmas Eve and loved them.  Reminds you of how good ""simple"" times
can be and have been.  Good family entertainment.",1293494400,5,207,4.857142857142857
4188749,5,B003SLEDJC,"Whether you're a casual or die-hard TAGS fan you gotta get this dvd set. For the casual fan it has all the classic episodes, for the die-hards it is chock-full of bonus material such as the complete Danny Thomas pilot and Return to Mayberry movie from 1986. All beautifully restored in stunning quality at an unbelievable price.",1292630400,51,328,4.771929824561403
4188750,5,B003SLEDJC,Whaaat?  They don't list Don Knotts and Ronnie Howard as the lead actors after Andy???,1287878400,,86,4.733333333333333
4188751,4,B003SLEDJC,"This is nice for all of us who bought the show season by season and weren't able to get the pilot episode and Return To Mayberry that was only offered in the complete boxed set. Aside from the episodes, some interesting little tidbits not included in any other DVD release of the series have been added.

Even nicer is the COMPLETE version of the pilot on this DVD set unlike the previous release by Paramount! It now includes the suit rental shop owner scene with Wil Wright, Andy's final speech on Danny's television show is extended, the epilogue is longer, and there is now a Maxwell House commercial with Andy and Danny right before the closing credits.

Season Three's ""The Darlings Are Coming"" is another episode that was edited on Paramount's previously released DVD. The 50th Anniversary disc contains a still edited, but different version. A Post Cereals commercial with Andy and Opie has been added just after the opening credits. Now only a line or two of dialogue has been snipped from Andy's first meeting with the Darlings (I believe more was cut from the previous release). A brief portion of the Darlings playing music just after they arrive in their hotel room is still missing along with their performance of ""Salty Dog"" and the bit of dialogue just before. However, the epilogue showing Andy marrying Charlene and Dud just before the Darling family plays ""Cindy"" has been restored.

Season Four's ""The Sermon For Today"" still has problems with a partially missing laugh track. The first DVD release of this episode contained no laugh track at all. Paramount treated this as a defect and replaced the DVDs with a ""fixed"" version, but this episode along with ""A Black Day For Mayberry"" (which does NOT appear on this 50th Anniversary set) still lose their laugh tracks at the 18 minute mark.

I'll add to this review as I find out more.",1287878400,29,1854,4.766355140186916
4188752,5,B003SLEDJC,"According to tvshowsondvd.com, this set will include both the pilot episode from ""The Danny Thomas Show"" and the reunion movie ""Return to Mayberry"". Like the previous reviewer, I bought each season as it was released and was more than a little upset when these features were only included in the complete series set. This ""Best of"" collection will also include 17 episodes(titles not yet released)sponsor spots and a featurette.",1286841600,16,428,5.217391304347826

8404479,4,B003SLEDJC,"I Love Andy Griffith and these shows are definitely some of the best.  However, I did not like that you can not just push play and have all the episodes play one after another.  You have to go through a process to select each movie because there are commentaries on each one which are really nice but sometimes you just want to watch the movies all at once and not have to go through so much trouble to do that.
