7383166,5,B0145NSN92,Awesome workout! 3 separate miles to choose from. And she's walking with her regular crew and a few new faces.,1446336000,,110,4.55
7383167,4,B0145NSN92,"I have quite an extensive library of Leslie Sansone walking DVD's and I bought this latest because I do them daily and like to alternate them for variety.  While there isn't much new to this workout, aside from side stepping four steps in lieu of the one or two steps, I like the workout quite a bit because it's upbeat and fairly fast paced.  If you've done or have a few Leslie Sansone DVD's, you'll be familiar with most of the core of her program - walking in place, side steps, kicks and knee lifts.  Added to that are some mambos, some - but not a lot - of boosted walking and some alternating sequences to add a bit of variety.  Despite the lack of queueing in some areas, which causes even the other walkers to mis-step, it's fairly easy to follow and, as Leslie often says, you can't do these workouts wrong - just keep moving.

The only issue I have with this DVD is the camera work.  At times, there is subtle blurring as Leslie moves.  Worse, there is a camera that more or less moves around aka mobile camera - and it's not steady and gives a bumpy view.  I have to avert my eyes when the footage is using that camera because it makes me dizzy and nauseated.  This gives the DVD a rather amateurish look and considering the fact that you're viewing this while also moving, it makes this otherwise great DVD almost unwatchable for me.

Rather comically, there are several missteps by the ""cast"", with people (particularly the gal in the tie-dyed top) not stopping one movement when everyone else does or going into a different movement altogether - but there is one sequence where the cast is moving in one direction - side to side - while Leslie is going in another.  Doesn't matter, but it is another example of where the DVD seems less than professional.

I recognized some of the walkers from more recent DVD's, but I have to admit I rather miss Joann, Linda, Mary Kay and Carol, to name a few of the walkers that we came to know for quite some time, but the cast here is diverse and they all seem to enjoy being in the DVD, which transfers to those of us at home walking with them.

Overall, this is a good workout in the Leslie Sansone tradition and she is her usual effervescent self, but her production team really let her down on this one with the poor camera work.",1446336000,6,2286,4.350588235294118
7383168,5,B0145NSN92,One of her great calorie burns.....love this one....just got it last Friday and was excited to join the walk! So fast moving! Real sweaty miles!!!!,1445904000,2,147,4.92
7383169,5,B0145NSN92,"Last week I purchased this BRAND NEW Leslie Sansone dvd from Amazon. I did the entire DVD plus bonus this past Thursday night with some friends so I could post my review and pictures on my blog. (EmpowerMoms dot net)

Breakdown of the DVD minutes:
0-3:00 Warm up
3:00-15:05 Mile 1
15:05-28:40 Mile 2
28:40-42:15 Mile 3
42:15-46:45 Cool down and Stretch

-There are no mile markers indicating mile 1, 2 and 3 transitions. Leslie tells you when you are done with each mile.

-Music is good and upbeat, no words. I recognized one or two songs from previous dvds.

-Typical fun cast including some new people!

-Movements include 8 small steps, 4 beats jogging/4 beats walking, 4 kicks then 4 knees, cha cha, squat then kick.

-There really isn't anything different about this workout except its a newer DVD to add to your exercise rotation. I really like it though and did mile 3 and cool down again this morning.

According to her heart rate monitor, my friend burned 450 calories in the 61 mins that we did this entire DVD workout, including the bonus!

You can see my full review and pictures, including a sneak peek video on my blog.",1445904000,75,1134,4.579207920792079

The healthy back and abs segment is actually both invigorating AND relaxing. I also bought Leslie's Miracle Miles system recently, too, but this one will be in heavy rotation for me for a long time to come!",1445558400,7,368,4.676923076923077
7383172,5,B0145NSN92,"I have a lot of Leslie Sansone's walking DVD's and I believe this is one of the best. I ordered 3 new ones in the last 3 months and 2 of them came recently, the 3rd will be released in November 2015. Great, strong beat, I love the smiles and Nick, Marvin & Camilla. (also Leslie)
I did 2 out of the 3 miles with a smile on my face and boy did it go fast. This is a brand new video not a redo, 3 miles and you can turn off the instructions and just have the music. Highly recommend for young and old as the moves can be modified either way with more energy or less.",1445472000,46,564,3.788135593220339
7383173,5,B0145NSN92,"I was actually surprised by this DVD. From the looks of it, I thought it was going to be a low impact-easy-going DVD. And I was looking for that becuase I had already did a walk around campus, and didn't mind a little extra workout.

No! It was FUN! I felt like I was dancing rather than working out, and I guess when you have fun, time flies by. I almost wish this was at least a 4-mile workout. There was a nice balance of pump and modest cardio.

Burned 219 calories. I think my watch is slowly dying. So, later, I'll probably add another calorie number when I get something more reliable. Usually, you burn 100 every mile. That's what Leslie said in one of her articles.
UPDATE
Watch read 252 calories this time.
My other app read 224

People
Half are new faces, and the other Half are Marvin (yay!), Nick, Tammy, and Kamilah. There are two older ladies, and I like how diverse the walkers were and uplifting their moods were during the entire thing. Everybody looked like they had fun.

Music
I was very impressed with the music. Her last DVD she had out was awful, which made me scared for this one. But there was not one song I didn't like. In fact, it was the reason why I worked out harder, becuase my ears were so into it. There was one I recognized from Walk it Off in 30 Days.

Mile 1
You start off with a modest speed and all it is, is her regular moves, but by the end, the music got REALLY fast, and she'll have you do an 8-step. You'll quickly have fun. Nick was stomping so hard in the back, and Marvin was doing a couple of moves in advance. So, I challenged myself right behind him. She's a little sloppy with calling the moves on time, but it's easily dismissive. Don't worry.

Mile 2
There's also a very fast song in this one. Some of the intense moves are doing kicking with your arms going up, a boost, but a modest boost in place of 4, then walk 4. Another is kicking 4 times in pattern of 4 knees. This isn't super intense, but it's enough to make you feel like you really got a worthy workout in the day.

Mile 3
You start off with a modest pace. Some moves are tapping back with swinging arms, mambo, mini squat and clap, sit and kick, 8-step, and step-knee. Her cool down is super rushed!

Floor Session
You all know her by now. She does pretty much the same moves, but she'll throw in some oblique moves, foot flexing, hugging knee, mini sit ups, and tease you a bit when doing the full plank on the floor. She advised that you do this three times a week.

I do believe this is worth the money. I had fun.

Weight-Loss Stories
About four women share their stories of losing weight by this program. I can say from experience that when I first did Leslie Workouts, I lost about 10 pounds. When I got my mom involved for the first time, she lost 12 pounds.",1445299200,105,2937,4.153169014084507
7383174,2,B0145NSN92,"I love Leslie Sansone and her walking videos. I own several, but this one is terrible if you have motion sickness. The music is just so so, and the camera man decides to Shake Rattle and Roll the camera for no apparent reason at any given moment. I couldn't even look at the screen while I was working out. If you don't get motion sickness and you don't mind generic music, then absolutely get this video because you will get a decent workout. I prefer all of her other releases that I own.",1529366400,,490,4.279569892473118

7383178,5,B0145NSN92,"I never leave reviews but had to for this.
I got this because I was at my wits end. 35, fibromyalgia for 12 years.
Each time I have  started a workout routine I get a pain flare up because I truly am not equipped for it pain wise. But its hard to lose weight because - you get the picture. Its annoying.
Finally decided I am trying to do too much at once, maybe I should start small like I always read about. Maybe a walking dvd. Is that a real thing?
 yes, it is and it was just what I was hoping for.
Because its broken up into miles, I was able to  just start with one mile, in my living room. When Leslie announced, happy and proud, that we had completed a mile, I honestly cried. I was so happy and proud too! I knew Id finally found something I could do regularly without triggering a flare up!
The first week I did the mile three times. The next week, 4 Times.  This past week, I did the mile 3 Times and did two miles twice! I honestly look forward to doing this dvd. And don't be fooled - if you're out of shape, and you follow her workout - you will work up a sweat. She has you do arm lifts, kicks, knee lifts (if you're able to) and so this is more than just walking if you're up for it.
If you're looking for something to keep you active while you battle an illness, or whatever your case is, try this. In a few weeks *you* might be the one surprising yourself because you're looking forward to your workout!",1525132800,2,1421,4.010600706713781

It's a quick 2.5 miles, so I may use it for that in the future, but for now, it's going to the bottom of the pile.",1520035200,,365,3.493827160493827

Must admit I'm still killing myself trying to do the mile.  But the DVD is all I expected it to be, only time will tell if it helps me get fit.  Meanwhile I'm captivated.",1517356800,,292,4.160714285714286
7383192,5,B0145NSN92,"I have been doing Leslie's videos for years.  I own more than a dozen of them so I almost passed on this one but I'm glad I didn't.
Pros:
-PRODUCTION VALUES Like many of the other in the JUST WALK series, this is a very polished production. (Leslie has had many names for her Walking workouts over the years-WALK AWAY THE POUNDS, WALK AT HOME ect. You probably won't go wrong with any from the JUST WALK series.) Good lighting, Nice set, Good sound, Decent music.
- REAL PEOPLE  A lot of the DVDs in the JUST WALK series feature walkers who look like they came from central casting-Nothing wrong with that- As a guy I like watching pretty girls as I exercise, but I know it helps alot of us to see someone at the same fitness level as us.  There are no real heavies like myself here, but there are 2 token males and an older woman.  A few familiar faces from other videos.  I like to think that Leslie chooses people who come to her fitness classes regularly. She seems to know and actually like many of her fellow walkers here.
-TESTIMONIALS One of the extras makes up for the lack of us fatties by showing several people who have lost up to 100 lbs using her workouts. (I wish she had these on all her videos.)
-THE ABILITY TO TURN LESLIE OFF I have grown to love Leslie over the years, but I I will admit that when I started doing her videos it was hard for me.  She's very perky and upbeat and constantly chatting.(Kind of like that Co-worker you avoid until you've had your morning coffee.) So when I've done her videos a few dozen times and have memorized her cueing, it is a blessing to be able to turn her chatter off. (BTW nobody cues better than Leslie.)
-LOVE THE MUSIC Many Leslie videos have annoying music of pop hits covered by horrible studio musicians.  This is more like EDM/techno, probably created on someone's Macbook.  It's nothing I would ask someone to burn a copy of so I can listen to in the car, but it's serviceable. (To me the only thing worse than listening to Lionel Richie's Dancing on the Ceiling while you work out is being stuck with an earworm all day going through your head of a bad cover of Dancing on the Ceiling.)
-CHALLENGING BY LESLIE STANDARDS If you're a gym rat and love videos like P90X or INSANITY, Leslie is not you girl, so move along. If you have 25 or more pounds to lose or are new to exercising, THESE ARE YOUR VIDEOS! (I myself have lost 40 lbs, and would be thrilled if I could lose 100 more. TV shows like the BIGGEST LOSER have brainwashed us all that exercise is meant to be torture, that you have to punish yourself for all the years you let yourself go.  If you're heavy, this moderate exercise is way better for you than trying to kill yourself at a pace that will be impossible to maintain.  I often crave something more intense than these walking workouts and often try others, but after injuring myself or falling off the wagon, I always come back to her. Having said that, her bonus floor exercises (Here she has one for abs and back) are often to much for me, so I stick to the walking workouts. This walking workout is among the most intense she offers.  If it seems to much for you at first, I would encourage you to try some of her other walking videos, but don't give up.  Leslie will get you to this level in a month or two. (I hate to tell you this but you have to watch your diet too;  Leslie's workouts will do very little for you if you don't pay attention to what goes in your mouth.)
CONS
I don't have alot of complaints about this one. Except:
-1, 2, OR 3 MILE OPTIONS  While it's great to be able to choose between a 10 minute, 20 minute or 30 minute options, I like it better on her older videos where each one was treated as a completely separate workout, rather than simple chapter breaks.  This certainly makes it easier for Leslie, and it's better to have this option than not, but you only get the complete workout-warm ups and cool downs and stretch- if you do the 3 mile option.  A little more tech savvy on the DVD programing workout on her end could eliminate this, but for all intents and purposes this should be considered a 3 mile/40 minute workout.
Thanks for reading this long rant.  Please like this if it was helpful to you.",1515715200,8,4221,4.289308176100629

She stuck to mostly simple moves, so it was much easier to follow along for the coordination challenged (one of my bigger complaints with Walking to Hits).

This one is quick, a little high intensity that you can modify - and I pair this with her other DVD's - There is a lot of arm work in this one, so if not used to that, modify at first.  This would be considered minor HIIT training as she does go up and down a bit, nothing major though.  And once you know the routine, you can do music only.

While I did not profusely sweat during the program as I do with other workouts, I enjoyed working out with this program while recovering from a knee injury. After my knee got better I added wrist and ankle weights and I got a pretty good workout.

I enjoyed this dvd so much that I purchased 2 additional dvds from Amazon.

I have to give a warning about Leslie's talking during the program. While she doesn't bother me, she might annoy some. She does talk a lot and her voice may annoy some. Good thing about the dvds I have used is the option to just have the music play and not hear her.

I love the people, though, and Leslie's adorable personality, as well as those of the exercisers'.  I watched the back and abs exercises part but didn't do them b/c I have a few badly herniated cervical discs and am probably overly cautious ;-) .  Also, I wish there was a cool-down section that you could go directly to b/c it is only in the third mile segment that there is a cool-down.  So if you want to only do one or two miles, you will have to do that on your own.",1491609600,3,775,4.167785234899329

I was very disappointed in this one and 5 Boosted Miles (purchased at the same time) because both of them had at least 10 freezes/stops in them.  I could not continue playing them because I was very frustrated with the freezes/stops.  There is nothing wrong with my DVD player because I also purchased Walk to the Hits All Time Favorites (at the same time) and there were no freezes or stops on that DVD or any of her earlier DVDs I purchased in 2015.

To compliment my physical therapy and get my heart rate up, I started with my old video and then added Walking Off the Pounds for variety.

The three miles went by fast with a lot of variation and motivating music. The extra toning for back and stomach was just enough and effective. Leslie's videos are not trendy or flashy but they are safe and versatile for all levels of walkers except for maybe those die-hard, over the top, young athletes.  There is only one thing I'd add to make it better. I like when she includes a counting down clock shone. It motivates me, I like to see it go down. I also wish she giggled less and I don't really need interactions with other walkers. It does bode well that she has different ages represented and not all, skinny, young dancers. I have several videos where she is by herself which I like because she's calmer and more focused.

I was starting an exercise program after years of incapacitating health issues, so had no coordination, balance, strength, stamina... None of this is complicated and I was able to mostly keep up after just a few times through.  You can start with the first mile and work your way up, and once you get to all three miles, work on making the moves more energetic.  My only negative is that she's really chatty and I can't stand listening to the same chatter over and over and over, omg just shut up.  There is an option to turn off the talking, but then you don't get the cues of what to do.

My issue is it's not possible to do a 1 or 2 mile COMPLETE workout. If you do a 1 or 2 mile workout, there's no cool down. Leslie tells you when mile 1 and 2 are finished and continues with mile 3. There's no way to get to the cool down period of the workout. It would be nice if the warm up and cool down were listed in the menu.

This video allows me in the comfort of my home no matter what I am wearing or how I look, I get my walking done.  The pace is pretty easy but it does ramp you up pretty quickly.  You find that with the background music you just naturally move faster to the beat.  In addition, the movement gets to muscles that you may not work out during a normal outside walk.  I am definitely a Leslie fan now and am looking into getting some of the other videos soon so I don't lose interest in this one and stop the momentum I currently have going.

There are a few parts where my heartrate gets up and I'm seriously sweating, but overall this is a middle of the road exercise DVD for those days when you need something.  I've used this DVD when I haven't been feeling all that well (head cold, not motivated) and managed to get through the first 2 miles walks (approx 30 min) without an issue.

Just for the record, I'm definitely overweight, but also have a bad knee and a slipped disc in my back, so I need to aerobics activities that do not impact my back and this works.

7383373,3,B0145NSN92,"I like Leslie Sansone and this form of exercise.  I live in a very rural area.  It take 15 minutes to get to the nearest gym and our curvy mountain road is dangerous for walking so WAH is great for me.  I have 16 Leslie Sansone videos; 12 DVD and 4 streaming.  Bought all but one on Amazon.  I can deal with missteps, flubbed lines, occasional weird music but this DVD had a video problem that makes the exercisers look like they are in a carnival house mirror.  It makes it difficult to watch.  Additionally, when she ends each mile, the exercise stops in mid-step and goes back to the menu.  Just make sure you have your remote control nearby so you can easily go to the next session if you want.

I will continue WAH but probably won't use this video very much.",1451606400,3,764,4.25

7383388,5,B0145NSN92,"Okay, I confess, I own every one of Leslie's Walk Videos.  And that's a LOT of videos.  But I have to say, this is one of my favorites. It follows a familiar format - three separate miles that start out a little more slowly, and then ramp up quickly. By the end of mile 3 I've typically worked up a light sweat, which I is what I want. Great group of walkers, who make joining along fun. Leslie is her usual upbeat and encouraging self, the music is good (great beat which is easy to follow along with), and familiar steps (one new one a back tap move that I haven't seen before).  For the last several of Leslie's video's she's been doing some interval training - where for a very short period of time she has you jogging, bouncing, twisting, etc at an accelerated rate in order to get/keep our heart rates at a nice aerobic level. This one uses a ""jog"" in place for four, and then has you walk for four.  She also has a few sessions of ""jogging"" forward 8 and backwards 8.  I like that a whole lot more than bouncing (too much jiggle I guess!) or twisting (which I seem to get too enthusiastic with and seem to twinge my back with all the twisting). The only thing I didn't like is some camera work that was new -- it looked like someone strapped a camera on and was walking around with it - it gave some odd angles and more ""bounce"" than I'm used to -- and gave me a little vertigo like feeling in a few places, but a small issue.  A great addition to my collection -- I love the variety -- and a really easy way to mix it up and keep walking fresh.",1447027200,30,1552,4.088815789473684
7383389,3,B0145NSN92,"I am a huge Leslie Sansone fan and have many of her dvds.  She has indeed become my main exercise regime and I am getting fit and losing weight thanks to her.  I would rate this 5 stars even though it is slower paced and more for beginners and intermediates but I was really disappointed to see that each mile was only .75 mile.  I use a pedometer every time I use her dvds and 1 mile always shows as such on the pedometer and aerobic steps show as 2,000 every mile (sometimes a little more if I boosted it up.)  Her group member Nick is my motivator who I follow on all the dvds and with this one I did every mile and every step at the same pace he did.  After the 3 miles and cool down the pedometer read 2.32 miles and 5,385 steps.  And for that reading I boosted as much as I could.  I also checked the pedometer every time she announced another mile had been done and the pedometer showed an estimated .75 mile rather than a full mile.  It also was a let down that I never felt like I never went into a steady fast paced burn.  The highest level on this dvd is a mid build up range on other dvds.  Luckily this dvd will be perfect for a friend of mine who wants to start following Leslie as well for it just doesn't provide a good enough workout to become part of my regular routine.  My favorite Leslie dvd is WALK TO THE HITS - ALL TIME FAVORITES.  It is a very strenuous workout but last time I did it I walked 6,423 aerobic steps doing the entire 3 mile dvd.  I hate giving Leslie a review less than 4 stars but it is important for her regular walkers and new ones as well to know that it is basically a mid paced 2 mile plus dvd.  It is not 3 miles as advertised.  And when I was finished I just wished I had done another dvd that would have provided a more strenuous, faster paced routine regardless of the miles.  I love all her moves and the feeling after a good workout is always amazing.  I did sweat on this one after about 20 minutes but it is the first dvd I was able to do from beginning to end the very first time and feel like it was moreso an extended warm up.  It just never got going for me.  And I need to say it one more time.  I am very disappointed with leslie that it is not 3 miles as advertised.  I want to walk so many miles per day and this was supposed to provide an option for my 3 mile day but it will not.

I would guess the pace is somewhere between 4 mph and 5 mph most of the time, which makes your heart rate stay elevated, therefore maximising your fat burning potential.  Following her recent trend, Leslie walks around interacting with the other walkers - I love how much fun the older lady is having!  If you are an absolute beginner, you may find the pace a bit fast to start with, however by making your movements a bit smaller, you can most definitely follow this workout too.  When I find my heart rate is getting too elevated for my 'mature age', I just lower the arms and for a while continue with the foot work only until I feel less tired.  This is a great workout, with the usual steps and combinations, and with fantastic upbeat workout music!",1446768000,2,830,4.392156862745098
7383392,5,B0145NSN92,"I just received the Walking OFF the Pounds dvd and I did all 3 miles. I did not do the Bonus segment of Healthy Abs & Back.  By far, this is an excellent exercise dvd and NOT for beginners.  It has the basic movements, adds a few others and the intensity is much more.  Definitely worth buying.  I am 53 years old, have 8 children and am down to a size 8/10 from a tight 14/16+",1446595200,7,377,3.9210526315789473

I would really appreciate a replacement as I was looking forward to doing the work out. Sincerely, Dawn Fox",1534636800,,247,4.511111111111111

8729699,5,B0145NSN92,This is a fun and fast fat-blasting workout. Leaves you feeling healthy. I am 61-years old and love this walk. This is the perfect exercise. I really enjoy Leslies' great workouts and this one runs 45-minutes of easy and some fancy stepping. I like this one  best of the bookshelf of her other DVD. But you can feel the difference in health and fat-burning fun.,1533600000,,361,4.553846153846154

8729701,1,B0145NSN92,"Ok, the exercise part is excellent. The DVDs are super flimsly, poor quality. Everybody I personally know which purchased any DVDs within the ""Walk Away the pounds"" series has had to replace their DVDs ... until they just give up. My self included, I bought three different WATP dvds. The dvds each started skipping after the first play. I bought them dvds again, this time with the replacement insurance. Same thing, the new dvds began randomly skipping too. Same thing happened to others & my friends. The workouts are really fun, such a shame the dvd quality is junk.",1532908800,,570,4.767676767676767
8729702,3,B0145NSN92,"Fairly typical Walk tape from Leslie but it is always a good workout.  Sometimes her chatter is annoying after awhile but there is an option to play without sound but then you don't here the music and you don't know when you are supposed to go to the next movement.  Not sure what they were thinking when they thought that was a good idea.  How about this Leslie.  Make a work out session where you can hear the music and cue the next step on the bottom of the screen with graphics like you do when you approach the 1,2, 3 mile mark.",1532736000,,533,4.145631067961165
