7671715,4,B01C3JYHJA,"Moody British indie about a worldwide pandemic. It is a creepy and thoughtful horror which took me by surprise in places, lots of twists and turns.",1464566400,,147,4.6923076923076925
7671716,1,B01C3JYHJA,worst movie ever,1463097600,,16,4.666666666666667
7671717,3,B01C3JYHJA,"This is ""Airplane 2016"" meets ""Infection""...typical airplane disaster film with infected zombies... I liked it.  It was weak in parts, like where the Flight Steward is trying to sabotage the radios in the belly of the plane, pulling electronics out with sparks flying (see what I did there)...then when he pulls out one piece of gear, it sprays him with liquid.  LIQUID ELECTRICITY I guess...probably what's infecting everyone.  The other BIG PLOT PROBLEM is they make it clear once your'e infected you time to death is short lived...AND YET, you see plenty of infected in this movie just hanging on.  I liked it none the less...You'll be especially surprised when you get to 1 hr and 3 mins...Aye yai yai!!!",1463011200,2,708,4.875
7671718,1,B01C3JYHJA,Vary bad movie.,1459555200,,15,4.333333333333333
7671719,2,B01C3JYHJA,"The world becomes infected with an antibiotic-resistant bacteria. A group opts to fly to Greenland where they understand there is a cure. They get forced to land and have issues. The infection causes large deformities i.e. Elephant Man look. There is internal conflict in the group as one person believes they should stay put for humanity. It becomes loose alliances and every man for themselves.

The film was more drama than horror. It was low budget and I thought I was watching a made for TV production due to the sound track and lameness of the script. Nobody wears gloves or uses alcohol wipes or bleach. Recommend ""Carriers"" or ""Quarantine 2: Terminal"" instead.

7671720,1,B01C3JYHJA,I had a horrible viewing experience. This movie was pure trash with plot holes all over the place ans characters with no common sense,1514764800,2,133,4.583333333333333
7671721,1,B01C3JYHJA,After the first 15 minutes I fast forwarded to see the conclusion.,1513814400,,66,4.583333333333333
7671722,4,B01C3JYHJA,"A thoroughly desperate and depressing story of the slow death of humanity, both literally to the illness and metaphorically as the horror of the portrayed reality strips away the covers of civility and morality we all wear. I thought the acting was quite good, and the story is quite tragic from the very start. Some other comments say that the script is bordering on incoherence, meandering or otherwise poorly constructed, but I find myself wondering if could that be somewhat intentional? The premise that these characters are facing an increasingly hopeless situation, and are making decisions under extraordinary duress as loved ones die, the healthy fall ill, and the ill show no regard for life.

I enjoyed this movie, even if it doesn't get a fairy tale ending.",1513728000,,769,5.0078125
7671723,2,B01C3JYHJA,"A bunch of potentially good ideas stitched together into a completely incoherent Frankenstein's monster of an (... Action?) movie. It is as if someone on too much cocaine was manically describing their screenplay, and then whoever they were telling said ""Excellent idea, let's make it.""

""So Justin Trudeau is piloting an airplane, and the guy's family, but they didn't make it, and then the guy is infected, but there's no saw, so they use a chisel because there's no time! Then the guy with the gun is running from the virus, but there's a cure, but the guy with the baton is like 'No we can't'  so he ruins the plane, and the truck full of fuel is like vrrrrrm but the virus is coming, so they have to go now, but the runway is blocked!""
You get it. All in all, it's worth the watch for fun, but I was expecting a zombie movie, or something.",1509062400,2,844,4.369426751592357
7671724,3,B01C3JYHJA,"Good B flick.  Solid idea, not bad just not an A lister.",1508284800,,56,3.6666666666666665
7671725,3,B01C3JYHJA,"Overall I was a little disappointed. It had a decent premise. The production was professional and the acting was excellent. I just didn't like the way the story went. So its an opinion thing. It was just full off boneheaded decisions and needless drama. The drama was ladled on too thick. The situation is drama enough you don't need the mindless stupidity. Also the virus got on the plane way too quick. So at no point is there a feeling of safety to slowly lose. Boom, it is straight into crisis mode in a crisis mode. That is just dumb writing. I wanted so much more for this. Not the actor's fault. They did great. The plot from start to finish is just garbled. Still, I gave it three because this is all opinion stuff.",1507680000,3,723,4.362962962962963
7671726,4,B01C3JYHJA,"That was a pretty good movie. I enjoyed it. I didn't think I would, but I did.",1506643200,,78,3.6470588235294117
7671727,1,B01C3JYHJA,Got almost painful to watch in regards to how bad the plot line was.,1506643200,,68,3.9285714285714284

7671729,3,B01C3JYHJA,Not that bad....,1506384000,,16,4.666666666666667
7671730,2,B01C3JYHJA,"Meh. The story was meandering, confusing, and so boring I actually started to fall asleep. It's not horror more of a action thriller minus the action or suspense.",1505606400,2,162,4.821428571428571
7671731,4,B01C3JYHJA,"A decently interesting movie. I didn't know exactly how it would end and who would be the hero and who would be the goat. I liked it although it is not really a horror movie more of a drama about an disease that turns people ugly before they die. However, they don't turn into bloodthirsty killers as a result of the disease. Many are already that way.",1504915200,,352,4.268656716417911

7671734,4,B01C3JYHJA,"Hey, it's free!  It has some good scenes, a little suspense, and an interesting storyline.  There were a lot of holes but, like I said, it's free.",1500681600,,146,4.37037037037037
7671735,1,B01C3JYHJA,No a bad story but had no characters to root for. Everyone acted horrible to each other.,1498867200,,88,4.235294117647059
7671736,2,B01C3JYHJA,"This nonsense is hard to call a movie; I would rather identify it as a pile of a five-year-old's random fantasies about how the world works. Because the story itself is rather basic and the characters are cut of cardboard, the viewer is left with too much time to ponder about questions such as ""Why are all these people so horrible?"" and ""So what exactly does this horrendous disease do?"" Since ""the pile"" fails to answer or even address any of those questions, the suspension of disbelief is crashed, so the only thing the viewer can think about by the end of ""the pile"" is ""Who the hell thought a five-year-old could make a good screen-writer?!"" Who, indeed.",1498348800,2,661,4.610169491525424

7671738,1,B01C3JYHJA,"Good storyline, decent acting.  But with the f-bomb in the first 20 minutes, decided uh-uh.",1497398400,,91,5.066666666666666
7671739,1,B01C3JYHJA,"Pointless movie.  Main character's motivations are illogical, antagonists motivations are illogical.  Production value is not bad, but the fact that there is no cogent plot, nor a resolution to the flimsy story line the film presents, causes this ""film"" to receive one star.",1497312000,,274,5.348837209302325
7671740,4,B01C3JYHJA,"While not a cinematic masterpiece, ""The Carrier"" is a solid, thoughtful, exciting, and unexpected delight for horror fans. The set-up seems like it is going to be another ""Zombies on a Plane"", but it actually is something much better and decidedly original.. Nothing cheesy here.(Which may help explain the negative reviews)",1497052800,5,324,5.372549019607843
7671741,5,B01C3JYHJA,Honestly it's pretty good you can tell at certain parts where they cut on budget but for the most part it seemed very well done I enjoyed it and at points especially towards the end it got harder and harder to tell that it was a B movie.,1496966400,2,237,3.9583333333333335
7671742,2,B01C3JYHJA,This movie was boring and had no depth!,1496534400,,39,4.0
7671743,4,B01C3JYHJA,"Pretty good film. The plot was good as well as the acting. What happens when a disease spreads around the world with no cure. Well, these people chose an airplane as a getaway; but, can they really escape?",1496188800,,205,4.421052631578948
7671744,5,B01C3JYHJA,"This movie was pretty good. The plot was good and had a lot of twist so the end could not be totally guessed.  The acting was fine and actually good in some parts.  I watched this movie on a lazy Monday afternoon and really enjoyed it. This film will not win any awards, however it is the prefect movie for a lazy afternoon.",1495411200,4,324,4.126984126984127

8752112,1,B01C3JYHJA,"Simply not enough adjectives to describe just how gawd awful this movie was. The makeup of the infected looks like some preschoolers had a fun day with play doh. I think I lost some non critical brain cells sitting through this one. Bad writing, bad direction, cheesy spec. ef.'s, painfully wretched acting. I can't even go on.",1529280000,,327,4.754385964912281

8752118,4,B01C3JYHJA,"3-1/2 stars but I rounded up. Decent acting and decent movie to add to the apocalyptic genre. I'm not sure where the bites came from, as we don't actually see anyone turn rabid (zombie). Maybe a plot hole, or I wasn't paying attention.",1517702400,,235,4.488372093023256

8752121,4,B01C3JYHJA,"I'm a fan of these ""one room"" or ""trapped"" movies.  This throws in some moral dilemma and doomsday scenario with it.  Pretty good over all.",1516233600,,139,4.52
