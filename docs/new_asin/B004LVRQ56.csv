8434927,4,B004LVRQ56,"It's ""different"" this one, that's a fair description. In contrast to so many similar projects put out on the market over the later years this title stands tall enough. Here's lots of good old film rolls included. The original ratio (4:3, presumed) is preserved and that is very pleasant. The technical quality is of VHS standard, but so what? The package is very nice though.",1391126400,,375,4.7846153846153845
8434928,4,B004LVRQ56,Different from other documentaries I have viewed on the Koren War.  Some perspective from the North and much more detailed coverage of major battles makes this one a standout.,1383091200,,175,5.0344827586206895
8434929,3,B004LVRQ56,Cannot say yet how it is  or anything about quality as it won't be opened untill Christmas. Maybe after holiday I will repost.,1381881600,,126,4.478260869565218
8434930,3,B004LVRQ56,Korean War is tragedies and suffering without other reasons. The war is created for the self-serving people who want to have their satisfactions. It is shame that we allowed this happened.,1361836800,2,188,5.096774193548387
8434931,5,B004LVRQ56,As a social studies teacher Korea:The Unfinished War is a good review of just what happened 1950 - 1953. I am grateful for the work that went into making this set available.,1343779200,5,173,4.4375
