8610122,2,B00EWNJKIO,"Beware if you are looking for family-friendly films -- ""The Man Who Saved Christmas"" is good, but ""Borrowed Hearts"" is extremely lewd.  We were surprised, because we actually ordered this as a replacement for our VHS copy of that film, which was delightful.  We discovered that the film we  owned and enjoyed was distributed by Feature Films for Families, and this one was very different; surprisingly raunchy for a family-oriented holiday film. Just be careful that you are ordering the film you intend to order, because there are multiple versions of ""Borrowed Hearts.""",1481328000,,571,5.118279569892473
