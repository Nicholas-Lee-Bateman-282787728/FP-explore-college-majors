1674714,3,B00005Y6YQ,"The three-star rating is not for the writing or production values, but for the nostalgic fun the adventure brings. This is only for fans of the series. A torchlight search amid glaciers is done well enough to belong in a better movie, but such things as sputtering spaceships and the unintentionally funny ""mechanical men"" are what we really watch the twelve episodes for. Charles Middleton as Ming the Merciless is a memorable villain without any discernable acting, and Buster Crabbe as always makes a credible, intelligent action hero.",1232323200,,538,5.125
1674715,3,B00005Y6YQ,"Flash Gordon is certainly the true precursor to ""Star Wars.""  Image Entertainment is distributing four feature length titles edited down to about 90 minutes from the original four hour serial length.  Zippy plots, lots of action, clever sets and surprisingly strong scripts do justice to ""THE PERIL FROM OUTER SPACE,"" ""THE PURPLE DEATH FROM OUTER SPACE,"" ""SPACE SHIP TO THE UNKNOWN"" and ""THE DEADLY RAY FROM MARS.""
Good stuff that looks even better when cut down to the central plot.  The action does not let up. See the whole series in order.
Larry ""Buster"" Crabbe is charismatic and strangely beautiful as the lead in this beguiling comic book space opera from the late 30s.
For die hard fans of this series, the full length, uncut serial ""FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE"" is also available.",1019347200,,796,4.925373134328358

7956425,2,B00005Y6YQ,"The back of the packaging says that you will need 3D Shudder Glasses. Not what the Product Alert says: ""This 3D disc requires red-and-blue 3D glasses and will play on non-3D enabled electronics."" So buyer beware! Other than that I can't complain. However I specifically bought this dvd because I only have the classic Red & Blue 3d glasses. So it was kind of a big deal to me.",1363651200,3,376,4.463768115942029
7956426,4,B00005Y6YQ,"Let the buyer beware!
There are many different releases of Flash Gordon Conquers The Universe available so a 3D version should breath new life into a very old Sc Fi Classic, or at least you would think so!  Unfortunately, the 3D version is dependent upon having several hundred Dollars worth of special equipment to view this movie on your television or home computer!  It would have been nice to know this before I placed the order!  At least you can still watch it in 2D!  It has been digitally remastered and therefore it will produce a rather sharp image even at high resolution and large screen size!

Another drawback is that this is only Episodes 1-4, and there are a total of 12 episodes so that means that the buyer still needs to buy two more DVD disks containing Episodes 5-8, and 9-12!",1247184000,5,797,4.545454545454546
