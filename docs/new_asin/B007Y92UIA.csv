You have to get to it on Amazon through Google. If you want it on DVD, download it from YouTube to an .avi file using YouTube downloader. Then use Microsoft's dvd maker and a dual layer disk to make a near hd DVD of the movie that will play on any DVD player. Or... Just watch it on YouTube.",1463443200,,426,4.144578313253012
