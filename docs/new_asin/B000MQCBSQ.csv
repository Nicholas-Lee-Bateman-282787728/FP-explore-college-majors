We like the time period, the subject matter, and especially the actors, but we wish they would make more episodes. Interestingly, we watched our first episode on a trip to Ireland from the U.

3625244,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This PBS Masterpiece Theatre Mystery series features Michael Kitchen, who gives a bravura performance as Deputy Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle. It takes place in the southern, coastal English countryside in 1940 during the early stages of World War ll.

While war is raging in England, Deputy Chief Superintendent Foyle goes about solving murders. All of the murders seems to relate in some way to the war effort, which makes it doubly  interesting.

This is a period drama, and it definitely maintains an authenticity of time and place. In this regard alone, it succeeds brilliantly. It has none of that artificial, highly stylised Hollywood type sense of what the period should look like. Rather, all is as it should be. Everyone looks perfectly natural and comfortable in their period clothing and  setting. The setting really does harken one to the 1940 English countryside and wartime England, and the social mores of the time are observed. This period drama most definitely gives the viewer a sense of what life must have been like during that dark and troubling time.

The supporting cast is terrific, overall. Most notable, however,  is  Honeysuckle Weeks,  who plays the role of Samantha Stewart, a vicar's daughter and Foyle's young driver. She infuses the role with innate decency and infectious enthusiasm. The very handsome and talented Julian Ovenden is perfectly cast as Foyle's son, Andrew, a Royal Air Force pilot. Anthony Howell is also excellent as Sergeant Paul Milner, a disabled war veteran who returns to police work, assisting Deputy Chief Superintendent Foyle with his investigations. It is without doubt, however, that Michael Kitchen is the star of the show, with an understated and  beautifully nuanced performance in the lead role.

There are four episodes in this  season, and there are nine seasons. So, if one enjoys season one, there are many more seasons to which to look forward. I know I am, as I love this series.",1489536000,,1958,5.0875
3625255,5,B000MQCBSQ,"As an American historian/educator I feel it has been lost over just a single generation what the people of Britain went through during WWII. Foyle's War has kept as close to historical accuracy as possible while intertwining the everyday mysteries of life as it continued in Britain. I actually didn't understand the suffrage the people went through during and after the war. As these mysteries continued with Foyle through the war years and after, it has kept myself and my family on edge with every episode.  It is indeed sad that Folye's War has come to an end. Hopefully the producers will see that this story can certainly continue with the many twists and turns that history provides as subject matter. Please continue to consider many more episodes of great quality programming that American Television cannot provide without adding sex and violence.

The only low point is when an episode ends.  Due to the vagaries of production, several of Horowitz's scripts were not made, which annoys me because I would have enjoyed them.  It also introduces a discontinuity in the timeline of the story.",1475625600,,489,4.843373493975903

3625332,5,B000MQCBSQ,"The long-running and critically acclaimed ""Foyle's War"" is built on a winning premise: that during World War II, a time when most of Britain was banding together to fight the Germans, unscrupulous members of society were using the upheaval and confusion to hide their criminal activity. It was up to a committed but largely unappreciated police force to keep law and order.

Christopher Foyle is one such individual; a Chief Superintendent in Hastings, Sussex  assisted by wounded soldier Paul Milner (Anthony Howell) as his sergeant and spunky but sheltered Samantha Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) as his driver.

Michael Kitchen is fantastic as the titular Foyle: calm, stoic, introverted and methodical  yet in Kitchen's hands the performance is riveting. You can SEE how he considers evidence, draws conclusions, seeks out clues, and carefully weeds out information during interviews with suspects  it's all in his eyes. Likewise, Howell is solid as a man struggling to reclaim his life despite a debilitating injury and Weeks brings a lot of lot and sunshine to the proceedings with her portrayal of a nave but enthusiastic young volunteer.

Julian Ovenden also regularly guest stars as Foyle's grown son Andrew, who joins the RAF at the outbreak of the war, and each episode is brimming with familiar faces, some of whom have since made it big in Hollywood. They include James McAvoy, Rosamund Pike and David Tennant, as well as the likes of Charles Dance, Sophia Myles, John Shrapnel, Roger Allam and Edward Fox. If you're a fan of British television, you'll be exclaiming: ""hey, it's that guy!"" every few minutes.

There are only four episodes (sometimes less) per season, and it's easy to see why. It's clearly a very expensive show to produce, especially in regards to the authentic detail of the costumes, locations, vehicles and wartime props. Horowitz clearly did his research on the period, and events such as the evacuation of Dunkirk and Operation Eagle Attack are incorporated into the plots.

The pilot episode ""The German Woman"" kicks off the show in 1940, where anti-German sentiment is running high. After the bombing of a local pub, the German wife of the village magistrate is found decapitated on the manor grounds, a Swastika carved into a nearby tree. Was it a revenge killing, or something else?

In ""The White Feather"" a case of sabotage leads Foyle to a hotel in which Nazi sympathisers are known to congregate. It's at one such gathering that the manageress is shot dead, though the party believes the intended target was their charismatic leader Guy Spencer. Despite Foyle's personal feelings toward the man, he searches for the killer.

""A Lesson in Murder"" is perhaps the weakest episode of season one, simply because it jumps repeatedly across half-a-dozen subplots, starting with the death of a conscientious objector in police custody, and ending with the shooting of a judge in a locked house. Throw in a pair of star-crossed lovers, a mysterious factory, an Italian restaurant owner and the London evacuations, and you have a very busy episode.

Finally, ""Eagle Day"" has Foyle's son Andrew uncovering a strange atmosphere of fear and secrets during his work in testing new radar technology. Meanwhile, Foyle begins investigating the death of Graham Davies, a lorry driver whose house was bombed in the air-raids  but who is found with a knife in his chest. Learning that the man drove priceless artefacts to secret locations in the countryside, Foyle wonders if perhaps this is the reason for his murder.

At just over ninety minutes long, the episodes can feel a little slow-paced at times, but the show excels at depicting the shades of grey and moral uncertainties of the period  especially when other shows and films are quite clear-cut in their portrayal of good and bad over the course of WWII. It paints a vivid portrait of a seminal time in British history, yet at the same time keeps things remarkably ""local"". This is a WWII story that doesn't focus on armies and soldiers, but the everyday heroes who fought to keep the home fires burning.",1470873600,,4085,5.005899705014749

3625345,4,B000MQCBSQ,"It's no criticism of this series (as far as I've gone with it) to say that the fact that ""we"" won World War 2 affects the way we respond to these stories and perhaps has affected too the kind of emotional coloration that they have been given.  The stories in this set all take place early in the war, when the idea that Britain might be invaded seems very real to the characters -- at least through the Dunkirk evacuation in the third story (""A Lesson in Murder"") -- and in that context, the disciplined focus on crime on the home front that we see in Foyle (Michael Kitchen) and his team seems all the more admirable -- especially since Foyle very much wants to leave his job in provincial Hastings and be closer to where he thinks he can make a more immediate impact on the war effort.  But he buckles down, follows his orders and does his duty.  He's meticulous, rather taciturn, and very careful -- an interesting character, with a son going into the RAF and himself now a widowed veteran of World War 1.  Kitchen gives a fine performance, and his two main helpers, his driver Samantha (Honeysuckle Weeks) and Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), a former policemen who lost a leg in Norway, are also most sympathetic.  Foyle's growing concern as the likelihood of his son's posting draws nearer, and Milner's domestic difficulties with a wife who can't face the fact of his disability are continuing strands as the stories go forward.  As far as the crimes are concerned, though, each story stands alone.

This is not the place for spoilers, so I'll just say that all the stories are engagingly told and beautifully photographed.  In this first series, the camera lets us see an England that seems stable and idyllic, and it's only in the final story that the bombs start falling.  So there's a sense of a way of life ending, just as one imagines the Edwardian summer before World War 1.  But this way of life isn't sentimentalized:  it's class-ridden, and riddled with misogyny, incipient fascism, and a readiness to fear people who aren't ""English"" (like the owner of a local Italian restaurant).  The stories are particularly alert to the way in which authority seeks to assert itself in ways that can be dangerous, and in all of these stories Foyle is challenged by people who think that he should bend to them because of their rank and status.  And, as the series title suggests, this is Foyle's war -- that's to say that what motivates the characters that Foyle has to deal with -- the innocent and the guilty -- is related to the war and the fears and anxieties it raises.  He's not on the front lines -- and couldn't be, at his age -- but his work is impacted by the war and perhaps impacts aspects of it in turn.

The series seems set up to employ some well-known guest actors -- in this first season, Charles Dance perhaps makes the most vivid impression (in ""The White Feather""), but there's good work from Edward Fox, Robert Hardy, David Tennant, Rosamund Pike, Anton Lesser, and Geoffrey Hutchings.  It's engaging and absorbing stuff, and it can induce a degree of nostalgia for a world that, while dangerous, was not beyond control and which was less complicated than the world of 2002, in which these movies first appeared.

If I have one reservation, it might be that the ""detection"" isn't as much at the center as one might imagine.  There are crimes, and they are solved, and Foyle lays it all out for us in little mini-lectures in each movie -- but one feels that the moods evoked in the process of the investigations are what counts.",1470096000,,3551,4.574132492113565

Det. Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a low keyed policeman who never seems to get ruffled over anything.  His one downfall is he doesn't drive and therefore needs a driver.  Enter MTA Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks), his assigned driver.

Set in the early stages of World War II, Foyle's War is fight in the homefront catching all manner of crooks.  This is definitely worth checking out.",1468108800,,647,5.047169811320755

3625500,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Mysteries tend to be unto themselves in regard to time and place. Other than some of the technological components they can pretty much be set anywhere. Not the case here. This is set during WWII and the war is an intimate part of the stories.

Here's the scoop. Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a chief investigator in Hastings, England in the early days of WWII. The war has done nothing to diminish crime and he is a busy many with fewer resources. As he does not drive, he is assigned a driver, Samantha Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) to get him around. These episodes are all self contained cases with a few overreaching arcs running between episodes.

This is not your typical crime drama. The episodes clock in at around 90 minutes each making them more like movies than TV episodes. Using WWII as a backdrop is also a real plus. Some of the stories involve the effects the war is having on the region so there is more gravity to what is happening in the story. And Foyle is way cool. He takes he expression ""walk softly but carry a big stick"" to the enth degree. He is very unassuming and never needs to be tough with those he suspects. He can take whatever minimal evidence is given him and still manage to sort things out. And when he puts it all together he approaches and accuses the perp with zero hesitation. He merely tells them in very calm fashion that they are guilty of this, that or the other thing. He's a widower with a son in the RAF and you get the impression that he isn't very good at expressing himself emotionally.

Some of the set-ups and solutions might be a bit too clever. More of a brain teaser than an actual situation but that is a minor quibble compared to the overall quality of the series. The production values are good enough and enough attention is paid to detail to give the viewer the proper sense of time and place.

This has run for 8 seasons. I'm nearly through the first and my hat is off to Anthony Horowitz and all the others involved for their ability to sustain such a remarkable effort.",1425859200,,2040,4.432

The screenplay is well written and is not too heavy-handed when the plot line confronts Foyle with a tough choice.  The writers and actors do an excellent job of developing the main characters and the plots are good, although there seem to be a lot more murders than a small English town would normally experience -- sort of like the mayhem in Cabot Cove.  The plots and the whole presentation are much more subtle than you get in a US detective series, and you get a flavor of what it was like to live under the cloud of war, air raid and possible invasion in wartime England.",1414454400,,858,4.487179487179487

3625734,5,B000MQCBSQ,"We have watched the 4 episodes from Season 1 plus the first one from Season 5 and have really enjoyed them all. We love the star of the show with his quiet calm manner, never getting angry or upset while steadily continuing his investigations during the rigors of war on the home front. I get tired of most of the American TV shows with all of the violence and language and find Foyle's War to be reminiscent of the days of gentility, even though it takes place during the early days of WWII. We both love it.",1406505600,,509,4.257731958762887

3625745,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Foyle's War is an excellent series that examines domestic issues in the context of the Second World War in the area of Hastings.  All four episodes are well acted with great cinematography.  The silence and body language of Inspector Foyle always leaves one contemplative.  It is a thoughtful series in which individuals not only deal with the war but with their own sense of mortality and views towards faith which are usually cynical or less than flattering towards the Church of England.  It seems to be critical generally of Britain's policies and practices but that is to be expected from any populous not aware of the ""big picture"" so called.  If nothing else you will enjoy the sleuthing and the interactions between Foyle and Sam and other characters.",1405987200,,759,4.8984375

I love the scenes with Foyle fly fishing, I read that Mr. Kitchen wanted it added and he was so right. I think that's what makes the series so good, the honesty of the stories.",1405123200,,312,4.131147540983607
3625814,4,B000MQCBSQ,"I saw a couple episodes years ago and thought it was boring.  When my DVR died recently, I found I could still get Amazon Prime videos through my Blu-Ray player.  Since one of my friends loved it, and Craig Ferguson had been pushing it on his show, I started watching Foyle's War, Season 1.  What I didn't understand was how very understated it is.  The humor is so very light and subtle, but definitely there.  So are the clues to the mystery.  It really requires you to pay attention.  And the glimpse it gives into the lives of the people who lived during those years is amazing.  Imagine carrying everything you own in a small (possibly cardboard) suitcase, not even as large as some of today's carry-ons.  Never knowing if your best mate will be dead tomorrow.  Wondering where your next meal will come from.  Wondering if YOU will be dead tomorrow.

3625821,4,B000MQCBSQ,"A solid crime series with an interesting twist, WW II.  It is this setting and solid cast that set this BBC series apart.  It's a quiet show with a soft voice.  The writers, while having a point of view, aren't trying to beat you over the head with it nor are the producers and directors trying to stun you into submission with on screen extravaganza.

I'm a boomer and I often ask myself what was day to day life like for my parents generation.  Growing up I was the beneficiary of that experience but I really don't know much about what it was like.  This show, in a mystery setting, goes a little way into showing what that might have been like.  In this way it shares a common goal with Downton Abbey and Upstairs Downstairs of trying to lift the corner of the tent on these days past lives.",1404777600,,795,4.26

3625877,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Foyle's War is one of my favorite TV series of any genre. A murder mystery set in England during the Second World War is something like a window into the past. All the regular functions of life had to continue even as the British people are being bombed and preparing for possible invasion. The attention to detail, even in the appearance of the food tins, lends this show a depth and polish which helps bring everything together.

I enjoyed Foyle's War as much as I enjoy Vera and Inspector Lewis. These show are just well done from start to finish.  The acting, drama, humor, and storylines are just fabulous.

What is not so fabulous is Amazon Prime including only episodes 1-6 with your prime membership of Foyle's War but 7 and 8 are $7.99 per episode?  Who does that? After reading a couple of reviews, about getting the DVD at the public library, I did just that.  I found the two episodes there and watched for free.  Amazon, really?  $99.00 vs free?

3625908,5,B000MQCBSQ,This is just an excellent series.  Casting and acting could not be better; Michael Kitchen is the perfect DCS!  Have already watched the series once and have now started my second time.,1403913600,,185,4.75
3625909,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I enjoyed the series very much. The only difficulty was the sound.  At times it was very hard to distinguish what was said, along with the English accent.  Very well done,  though.",1403913600,,180,4.5625
3625910,5,B000MQCBSQ,Very good series.  Look forward to each episode,1403827200,,47,4.875
3625911,5,B000MQCBSQ,What more to say but that the British do so much a better job at putting out quality detective series. One of the best and worth seeing again.,1403827200,,142,4.107142857142857
3625932,4,B000MQCBSQ,Prejudices are insidious and spread like a contagious disease. The weak aren't able to speak up against it and so keeping silent is just as bad as being overtly intolerant of a group of people.,1403827200,,193,4.542857142857143
3625933,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Love, Love, LOVE this series.  Even got my husband watching it for it's authenticity to the WWII period.... he's a Warbird NUT and loves the show.",1403827200,,146,4.615384615384615
3625934,5,B000MQCBSQ,Love the story line and Mike Kitchen's portrayal of life during war time. British dramas are the best in my opinion,1403827200,,115,4.523809523809524
3625935,3,B000MQCBSQ,"This British mystery series is interesting enough to watch multiple episodes, but it doesn't have the 'punch' of others shown on PBS such as Hercule Poirot or Midsomer Murders.  Foyle's persona is a bit too dry for my liking. He often 'drops his voice' at the end of a phrase or sentence--linguistically known as glottal fry.  This means a viewer will miss many words thru the course of an episode if the TV volume is at a normal comfort level.  I find I must keep the volume louder than normal comfort so as not to miss those many final words throughout the show.",1403740800,,564,4.456310679611651
3625936,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Great look at the war period, Additionally the main character provides a example of a good and principled man doing his best. The series is developing well. If you like british crime drama's this one is good.",1403740800,,208,4.648648648648648
3625937,5,B000MQCBSQ,This series is one of the best things I have ever seen on PBS.  Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle is wonderful.  (Wish I could find a man like him in real life.  All the actors in this series are wonderful.,1403654400,,209,4.3076923076923075

3625939,5,B000MQCBSQ,Show does not depend on violence or  special effects or fast action. But on acting and good story line and good writing.  Too bad Netflic stopped it.,1403568000,,149,4.481481481481482
3625940,5,B000MQCBSQ,Intriguing.  High interest.  We really enjoyed the series and watch three episodes in one day.  I would recommend to any WWII buffs as well.,1403568000,,140,4.75
3625941,4,B000MQCBSQ,"Good acting, good storyline, but I'm struggling with how much suicide is portrayed or murders assumed to be suicide. If this is a sensitive topic for you, proceed with caution.",1403568000,,176,4.9
3625962,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Each episode is like a small movie unto it's self.  The character, Foyle, has a great subtle, calm personality that gives him a ""wise man's"" flair!
The characters involved in each segment are like your neighbors with crooked teeth, no fancy hairdos, etc.  In other words like real people!
I enjoy this series immensely!",1403568000,,319,4.888888888888889

3625966,5,B000MQCBSQ,"The quality of these episodes is outstanding.  There is a perfect combination of multilayered plot, great acting, setting, and character development.  Placing these sequentially in the historical context of the beginning of the war in Europe and tying in the major events in England at the time is a bonus for those aware of the history.",1403308800,,337,5.0
3625967,5,B000MQCBSQ,"There is a lot of history woven into the ""who done it"" narratives. British attitudes toward naturalized Germans, domestic controversy over the merits of going to war and efforts by powerful parents to spare their children from combat share the story lines with Foyle's investigations. The social impact of the war on individuals is in many ways more interesting than the crime solving. Michael Kitchen's portrayal combines a steely inner commitment to justice with a compassion for those who are innocent victims of the war's impact on society. Kitchen often delivers the most powerful commentary when he holds his tongue in the course of investigating.",1403308800,,653,5.228571428571429
3625968,5,B000MQCBSQ,"As with the vast majority of Bitish actors, Micael Kitchen is fantastic.  Would never know that what he speaks has been rehearsed many times.",1403222400,,141,4.875
3625969,5,B000MQCBSQ,Micheal Kitchen use of his eyes and demeanor brings the character of Christopher Foyle to life.

3625970,5,B000MQCBSQ,Foyle's war features amazing acting playing the Brits at their best and worst during WW-II in the seaside town of Hastings.  The photography and settings are beautiful.  Watch one and you will be hooked for the rest.,1403222400,,216,4.8108108108108105
3625971,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I enjoy anything WWII, as a rule, and this series provides a quiet education as to what it was like in England and not able to serve in the military in the traditional sense.  Mysteries are a favorite.  Acting is superb!",1403136000,,220,4.341463414634147

3625973,5,B000MQCBSQ,This is an excellent period piece about a police investigator who works in southern England. The acting is wonderful and the stories are believable.

3625974,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is a unique view of World War II England and how things were for the people.  It is not the usual War Documentary, but a view of life of regular people dealing with the fears and deprivations of a coastal village preparing for an invasion.  Love the character portrayed by Michael Kitchen.  He is calm in the pursuit of law breakers and steadfastly honest.",1403049600,,361,4.523076923076923

3626004,5,B000MQCBSQ,This is an eye opener as to how the English dealt with there war with Germany. There was even more internal crime  than the bombings. Black market etc..,1402617600,,152,4.428571428571429
3626005,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This series is filled with details of England in the 1940's. It is no dry history though --- it is vibrant, filled with memorable characters and the day to day lives of ordinary people at an extraordinary time. The mysteries and detective work are as natural to the plot as are the interpersonal relationships that keep the viewer wondering. Wonderful viewing --- our third time. This is going to be a classic I'm thinking!

3626007,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Beautifully acted.  The series recreates the period well and emphasizes the value of quiet courage and integrity as well as humor, romantic interest, some adventure.
I have some questions for the writers about the implications for Anglo-American relations of Episode 1 Season 2 (Eagle).  Britain actually had money and sent at least one Purchasing Commission to the US in1940 before the beginning of Lend-Lease.",1402444800,,411,5.40625

Kitchen's Foyle is masterful work, right up there with Branoure  in Wallander.  1938-47 backwater Britten, a DCI at work, great back stories, superlative casting, locale and feel.

The series is set against the background of World War II in Hastings, England. The main characters are likeable and the story lines are engaging. There's mystery, murder, romance, quirky personalities and amazing twists and turns in the plot. The acting is top-notch.

The first episode The German Woman captured my attention immediately. There were so many suspects and they seemed equally able of having committed the murder.

I ended up watching every episode of Foyle's War within a month and kept wishing I could pace myself better. But the series is so good, I just couldn't make myself stop watching. Highly recommend this series.",1401580800,,756,5.080645161290323

3626088,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This series is a welcome replacement for Downton Abbey, which has, as they say (even though I don't like the term), ""jumped the shark"" and is no longer worth watching.  It's also much more entertaining than the rather insipid Mr. Selfrisge soap opera. The writing and acting in Foyle's War is excellent, and if you appreciate the likes of Inspector Lewis, then you'll also love Foyle's War.",1400544000,,390,4.82089552238806

The history is interesting but more importantly the mysteries are very well constructed and the characters and acting first rate!",1400457600,,170,5.538461538461538
3626091,5,B000MQCBSQ,After hearing Craig Ferguson raving about the show I decided to give it a try. Excellent show although at time a little slow. Right up there with the Cadfael Series.,1400371200,,165,4.533333333333333
3626112,5,B000MQCBSQ,"the series is smart, British in understatement. and well written. the characters believable and well thought out, plot lines smooth and seamless. i read about and enjoy watching movies about this period in English history so it keeps my attention with ease. the english class system is in place yet we are not beaten to death with it. the main character Foyle is not only aware of his station in life but he accepts it without bitterness or undue burden. his interactions with superiors both civil and within the police department make for an actor's workshop on diplomacy and tact. he's likable, has some charm and keeps the show going with direct, unhurried delivery.",1400284800,,669,4.87719298245614
3626113,5,B000MQCBSQ,"My wife talked me into watching this series and I am now addicted to it. Sometimes the British humor and slang take some getting used to, but the production of this series is top notch in all respects. The cast is excellent, the period scenes and costumes are excellent, the scripts are excellent, and I enjoy every episode. Watching previous episodes as reruns sometimes fills in gaps that were missed the first time around. Michael Kitchen is outstanding as a frustrated warrior who does not realize how valuable his service to his country as a police inspector really is. I highly recommend this series to anyone who is looking for high quality relief from US productions.",1400198400,,675,4.827586206896552

3626117,5,B000MQCBSQ,"First of all the World War II era is very fascinating to me.  This series is behind the front lines of the war, and it gives great glimpses of what life would have been like in England.

The main character Foyle has a 1st hand view of some of the issues that may not have made the front page headline news.  Crime had plenty of opportunities away from the battlefield, and that's where Foyle stepped in.  This may not be his 1st calling but he was extremely gifted at solving crimes.

I enjoy the supporting characters Sam and Milner as well.  Each of the characters has interesting challenges that they face.

Each episode is a challenge to try piecing together the crime before it is solved.

I also very much appreciate the series approach of keeping the content clean.  This is a good family series; yet it may be challenging for some to keep up with clues as they unfold.

I'm looking forward to watching season 2 and onward.",1399593600,,930,4.449704142011834

3626123,4,B000MQCBSQ,I like the show.  It's realistic as well as interesting and it seems like the kind of things that would actually happen are depicted.  I've watched the first season and haven't seen anything objectionable.,1399507200,,205,5.0
3626124,5,B000MQCBSQ,Wonderful storytelling and worth the time to view.  I watched some later seasons on PBS & found it was worth my time and energy to go back to the beginning of season 1 an see how the program began.,1399248000,,197,4.051282051282051
3626125,5,B000MQCBSQ,"The story takes place during WWII in England, where a detective chief inspector fights crime at a time when crime fighting is hardly a priority, and resources are slim.  In some episodes he bumps up against MI-5 and the SOE (dirty tricks department) who have very different views of who should be doing what.  Well-acted and with excellent writing and lavish production.  We go so hooked we watched two every night until we'd seen them all.  Then watched all of them all over again.  They are that good.  We found life in England fascinating at a time when no one knew if the Germans would invade tomorrow or the next day.  Recently Masterpiece Theater added to the series, updating it to the post war period when MI-5 comes looking for Foyle to root out Soviet agents in their ranks. The understated Kitchen plays Foyle perfectly.  Quite the opposite of a James Bond, but more interesting.",1399161600,,890,4.696774193548387

3626127,4,B000MQCBSQ,"A prime example of why I love British television.  A well-written, well-acted series with believable plots and characters.  My only minor quibble is that some of the shows could easily have been hour long episodes instead of an hour and a half and may have benefited by the shorter time slot.  On the other hand, maybe my attention span has simply been negatively affected by American television....contrarily, some  of the episodes benefited nicely from the longer time span, measuring out clues in a way that kept the viewer fully engaged, while increasing the suspense level until the mystery was solved.",1399075200,,607,5.04

3626130,5,B000MQCBSQ,"The entire series is well-done and addicting to watch.  If you're a fan of Masterpiece Mystery on PBS, you're sure to enjoy this series!  Many episodes deal with murder, the black market and conspiracy, but without being so darkly portrayed as to make you feel bereft at the conclusion.  Series 1 takes place during WWII and Inspector Foyle (our protagonist) is looking for ways to be more a part of the war effort instead of being relegated to what seems to be smaller, domestic matters.  His request for a transfer denied, he ironically finds his most recent murder case to be anything but ""smaller"" and simply ""domestic"".",1398902400,,624,4.803738317757009

3626136,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Foyle's War series one and other episodes seen out of order are a rare treat. This period production is perfect, the acting effortless and aligned with the time and the place, and the story line is complex enough to engage the viewer and require attention and thought but not too self-consciously correct.

Michael Kitchen and supporting cast are excellent actors and the stories are intelligent and not simple. The first series gives us a glimpse of England at war in a small rural town and crimes that are committed. The stories are never the same but the main ensemble of actors carry
the production with excellent dialogue matched by their talent. For those of you that like this era; a time when things were simpler but

He quietly gathers clews (but not in a Sherlockian way), interrogates suspects in a disarmingly low key method, and comes up with the solution.  Folye is aided by his faithful driver Samantha (""Sam"").

Foyle's series is an interesting view of the interface between extraordinary moments in a nation's life (the war) and civil society that goes on uninterrupted in the midst of a most unusual period.  Foyle deals with crimes brought about by the war situation (spies, blackmarket, etc.) as well as crimes that have nothing to do with the war.  This detective's approach to problems is inquisitive, humane and unflinching.  The plots are challenging with surprising twists.

Set in 1940 just as the British are getting into WW2, this extraordinarily acted series really show the conditions and the fears of British people at that time. The attention to detail in the props and scenery is fantastic, from the period cars to the narrow streets to the houses themselves, makes you feel like you are their.
Michael Kitchen is superb in the role as the chief inspector, a no nonsense detective who wants to be in the war effort but is told he must stay with the police.  Foyle goes about his business in a straight forward manor with intelligent police work with humanity and a strong sense of justice. The supporting cast are great and the guest cast will become the future icons of British TV including one David Tennant in episode 3 who will become a national treasure in Britain.

Foyle is a wonderful character as are those regulars with whom he has worked to solve very interesting crimes.  I love this series and hope the rest of the films are available from Prime.  This is a series I would gladly watch around the clock until I have seen them all!,1395964800,,388,4.202702702702703

3626200,5,B000MQCBSQ,I watched Foyle's War the first time because I wanted something different than what I had been watching and have always enjoyed British drama.  Foyle's War did not disappoint! Michael Kitchen is brilliant in his role as Christopher Foyle.  I highly recommend this series to anyone that is looking for something a bit different!,1395878400,,327,5.037037037037037
3626201,5,B000MQCBSQ,I love the stories and the time frame.  I also like Michael Kitchen and will look for more of his work.  I am enjoying all of the stories from BBC.,1395705600,,147,3.8666666666666667

3626205,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is one of the best mystery series I've ever come across.  The stories are complex but not confusing and the characters are realistic to the point that it is sometimes painful to watch - at least for me.  Kudos to the script writers, they have kept social commentary to a minimum on the surface, but nevertheless, it is always lurking there in the background.  And last but not least, the acting across the board is superb.  I am looking forward with great anticipation to the rest of the series.",1395705600,,500,4.522222222222222
3626206,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I watch this series again and again, and each time I find something new.  Deputy Chief Inspector Foyle desires to be more than a small town  policeman:  he wants to help in the war effort.  In a sense, he is involved as WWII is woven in throughout the series.  The setting is Hastings, a town on the coast of England.  Very engaging.",1395705600,,333,4.290322580645161

3626209,5,B000MQCBSQ,"The acting in this series is very good, and the main characters seem authentic for their time. Foyle seems an unlikely war hero, but his quiet determination illustrates the now famous saying, ""Keep calm and carry on.""",1395446400,,217,4.891891891891892
3626210,5,B000MQCBSQ,Kitchen is a great actor.  You can't help but to love his character.  (double entendre intended)  I am watching all of the series.  What a treasure trove!,1395360000,,154,4.592592592592593
3626211,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I didn't know about this series until it was recommended by a friend.  Acting and the cast are great.  Set in WWII with subplots of peripheral issues of the time.  Each episode is stand-alone, so feel free to watch any episode without being entirely lost.  Very much enjoy and will continue to watch all seasons.",1395187200,,312,4.618181818181818

3626228,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Not the same old murder mystery plots.  These plots are unique to the period and invite one to consider things most of us have never thought of before.  Episode 2 gave me a glimpse of how frightening it must have been for people living in the path of invasion and the different choices this presented.  Well written, well acted, great entertainment.  I never watched it on TV when it first came out so thank you Amazon Prime for making it available.",1394841600,,449,4.506172839506172
3626229,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Excellent series.
Cast is very good.
Characters are believable and actors are exceptional.
Glad I ""discovered"" them.

3626230,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I chose this rating because I like mysteries that do not need loud, action packed and X rated scenes with foul language to sell them. Instead this one has a quiet, intelligent nice looking man with excellent logic, and an added bonus of a backdrop of a hint of how it was to live in England during WWII. My father was in WWII. That generation is gone, but even when alive, some didn't like to take about it much.",1394668800,,412,4.227848101265823

3626233,5,B000MQCBSQ,I think Horowitz does a good job of starting multiple story threads and then ties them together at the end. The characters are believable. I particularly enjoy Foyle and Sam.,1394582400,,174,4.833333333333333
3626234,4,B000MQCBSQ,Foyle's War is typical British in it's story telling.  It is like a novel that once you start reading it. you can't put it down. Same thing for this movie.  It builds up piece by piece until you are finally hooked and you don't even know it.  Really enjoy the story lines revolving around WWII.,1394409600,,294,4.3090909090909095
3626235,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This well made series from Britain is one of the best.  Based on true happenings during WW II, it is well told, well acted and always informative.

time. Top marks to the producer.",1394236800,,312,4.491228070175438

3626252,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I really like Foyle's War because it shows how war affects not just those fighting on the front line, but also those that are left behind. Life goes on as normal in some ways, but yet nothing is normal. Foyle's war does an excellent job of drawing you into the times and life of everyday people. The good and the bad.",1393891200,,317,4.213114754098361

Each character is fully developed, thhe acting superb, the dialogue of highest level.  This series makes US television pale in comparison.

England at the beginning of ,WW Two, where manners and customs from an even earlier time still prevailed, but were about to be swept away by enormous forces of change.  The actors are wonderfully skillful, able to transmit thoughts, feelings and messages with great subtlety using intonation, facial expressions and thorough absorption in their roles.  Foyle's War is a feast for the intelligent viewer who decries the excess of modern media presentations and who treasures thoughtful and credibly presented drama, which stimulates the usage of the viewer's own brain.",1393632000,,675,5.174311926605505

3626266,4,B000MQCBSQ,"Season 1 of Foyle's War introduces us to the characters as well as the experiences of the people of Hastings during World War II.  The first episode, The German Woman, shows how all Germans were feared, even those who hated the Nazis.  Second, The White Feather reveals that there were many Brits who were Nazi sympathizers.  Episode 3, A Lesson in Murder, deals with conscientious objectors and children sent away from London to live in less dangerous areas of England.  Eagle Day has two unrelated stories, one about the theft of art treasures and one about the viciousness of authorities and secrets.  Michael Kitchen, Honeysuckle Weeks and Julian Ovenden (now in Downton Abby) are standouts in my book.  Supporting the leads is some very strong, very, very delightfully British talent.  Each story's plot and subplots are engaging with compelling consequences. There are a few moments that are too slow, maybe a little too lingering on the grieving, thus the 4 stars rather than 5.",1392940800,,985,4.969512195121951

Portrays the darkness in England in the early days of WWII.  Has its light moments - Michael Kitchen's acting is superb... am full court pressing on all of these series now.
Good mysteries, good supporting characters; different due to the wartime context.  Always interesting for Americans to get other nations' take on US.",1392854400,,458,4.7125

3626288,5,B000MQCBSQ,"The series Foyle's War brings to mind the detective movie of the week shows that aired in the sixties and seventies in our country.  It is the length of a movie,and the storyline has a daring detective that solves a difficult homicide.  Foyle's War, however, is far superior to our country's past shows.  Each show opens carefully revealing one layer at a time of its subplots as the viewer is led to discover how they all tie together to form the main plot of the story.  Several of the stories didn't even come to the actual homicide until over half way into the story.  The excellence of the actors skills are greatly enhanced with the well thought out scripts.  The shows hold the attention of their audience as you try to figure out who will be the victim and why it happened.  The writer of the scripts obviously spent a lot of time researching what life was like in England during World War II because much attention was given to the historical accuracy in each of the stories.  The audience is not only presented with an excellent detective story, but is also taught what it would have been like to live in England when the world was at war.  Each episode stands alone yet also takes the audience one month further into World War II.",1392336000,,1241,4.48

I am interested in WWII and I like the way they have taken ""small stories"" of everyday people and woven them into the big picture of the big war. Good writing and good attention to period settings.

3626322,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This series is well done, with all the elements coming together in a satisfying manner. Yes, it's takes place during WWII in England, but unlike some shows set in that era and location, you can almost always understand the dialogue. I would describe it as ""low-key"" but does not drag. The music is appropriate and does not get in the way. Well crafted, well written, well acted. My guess is that if you enjoy this genre, you will be happy from start to finish.",1391212800,,460,4.488095238095238

3626335,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Many of these reviews are six or seven years old and for the purchase of the DVD! This series was an Amazon prime recommendation and I do realize that an automated system generates the data. Except for a few odd ones, they have been spot on for me. If you enjoy cinematography, unusual storylines and excellent casting, this series presents the 'Murder Mystery' genre at it's British best! WWII era setting and a detective with a fascinatingly quirky personality . . . definitely recommend for a most enjoyable venture into this genre. WWII history buff or student of military history? This is a great combination! Oh no, not even a hint for the details! The 'plots thicken' so find out if you come to the same conclusions as Foyle. Worth watching!

Facial expressions and body language so well done.  Captivated by the cases and consider this one of our favorites.",1390435200,,281,4.957446808510638

3626354,5,B000MQCBSQ,Foyle's War is an incredible series of episodes that deal with the ongoing ethical issues faced by a society dealing with the pressures of war.

3626361,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Foyle's war is simply a great show. Good stories, great acting, interesting characters and a window onto an England that no longer exists. Foyle is a man with unimpeachable integrity and genuine compassion. He takes no BS from anyone. He never seems to lose his cool, though he is sorely tried and does sometimes become angry. His son is an RAF pilot during the most dangerous time of the war, part of the Battle of Britain. Foyle faces an ongoing battle with those who choose expediency and a sometimes mistaken perceived need to support the war effort over justice. I can't recommend this show enough (all the episodes in the series).",1389830400,,636,4.738738738738738

3626397,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Foyle is an engaging character, as are those of his supporting cast (Sgt. Milner and Driver Sam).  The crimes that they investigate during a major national focus on the wartime effort are credible and, for me anyway, provide a novel view of life at home (complete with crime) during a time of war.  The series causes me to wonder, for example, was crime and law enforcement altered in the United States during WWII?  What was law enforcement like in the colonies during the Revolutionary War?  Quite probably crime adapts to the situation, national emergency or otherwise notwithstanding.  In the Foyle series, the script and the settings really bring a sense of reality to the period.",1388880000,,685,4.921739130434783

German immigrants who settled along the coast of England were not deemed as trust-worthy as native born citizens, must like the later Japanese situation on the American West Coast. Shameful, yet somewhat understandable with threats of invasion and bombing from Germany. Who to trust? Some privileged escaped the indignities. (Some things never change.) Among the people, the series shows, were those influenced by propaganda, who perpetrated sabotage. Clandestine operations and ""dirty tricks"" appear to be in their infancy (perhaps it appears that way compared to reports today.

I am loving it, but have been so disappointed that I can't finish watching it at my second residence in the Turks & Caicos Islands!

2. Great story-telling - the plots are intriguing and complicated without being convoluted
3. Great scripts - the dialog is believable (if oh-so British!)
4. Great evocation of the period - we are learning things about the British involvement in WW2 that we never new.

You get to learn the English view about the war and how the Americans were not in it yet. You understand how the English are designed by their circumstances to carried on ""to never give up, never surrender"".

The methods of Foyle are almost vigilante, if he cannot arrest someone he certainly knows how to doom them and from this the series may have been more aptly named Folye's Justice.",1386460800,,503,4.467391304347826

Through the backdrop of the Second World War and the Battle of Britain crime is rooted out and handled as are the occasional Nazi spy and collaborator by Inspector Foyle even though he would much rather have been serving Queen and country in the thick of battle. The career of this paradigm of English Cops is followed through these tumultuous and dark days with great insight into the British psyche.

3626508,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Foyle's War is authentic, compelling and deeply engaging. The writing, cinematography and art direction are all the very best possible.
Foyle is a complex character, both 'at war' with himself and his environment. We're giving little insight as to his demons, but, little by little some is revealed.
All the characters are portrayed in a way that brings the viewer into the terrible life of Britain during the war. And the story doesn't shy away from the less than savory characters that war brought to one's doorstep unearth.
I'm sure you'll be totally hooked as I am!",1385942400,,569,4.876288659793815

3626532,5,B000MQCBSQ,Great mystery series that ends up more about the characters and less about the mystery.  I truly ended up caring about what happened to the lead characters and the mystery part was just a hook to use to explore these remarkable people.,1385596800,,235,4.595238095238095

details like the rationing and struggles of ordinary people, I am drawn back to my early childhood.  I would rate it 5 stars but for some graphic details and scenes that are, I believe, unnecessary and indeed precludes my wife from watching and enjoying the program series with me.

3626537,3,B000MQCBSQ,I like it but it wasn't exciting. I was left waiting for a rush or action sequence but it was kind of droll. It was good but not great. The story line was interesting and the plot was good. When I'm in the mood for less action this is what I will watch.,1385078400,,253,3.792452830188679

3626553,5,B000MQCBSQ,"An extraordinary combination of police procedural, character-based drama, and historical fiction, Foyle's War takes us into the life of a widowed police detective working in a town on England's southern coast during World War II.  Each episode gives us not only an intriguing mystery (and one that plays a bit fairer than most detective shows - you can spot the key clues if you're attentive), but also growing insights into both the main characters and various aspects of society in wartime Britain, including many details most Americans wouldn't be aware of (I know I wasn't).  Foyle's stoic decency is leavened with a small measure of dry humor that plays well against his young driver's sunny disposition and eagerness to help (sometimes more than she should).  Other regulars include a wounded veteran and former detective that Foyle brings back on the force to work with him, and Foyle's son, an ace RAF fighter pilot.

We happened to see the latest series (by then at the dawn of the Cold War) on PBS in fall 2013, and were so intrigued we went back to watch the show from the first series - very glad we did.  A truly remarkable program.",1383523200,,1145,4.762626262626263

The entire series seems to be very historically accurate and the photography is very well done as well with all the right vintage autos, clothing and buildings. Foyle is a man of high integrity and somewhat quite personality who always seem to be taking in more than most people realize. The writing is excellent and the values are refreshing and the series has become an all time favorite for my wife and I.

3626654,4,B000MQCBSQ,"Second time watching the first episode. I see some problems: First- one German bomber, low level, out of formation, drops one bomb instead of a payload, on a pub? Second- the wire that killed Greta would have had to be at precisely the right height. Too low and it would hit the horse, or her torso, too high, and it would miss her or hit her head. How did he measure the height of her on a horse? Episode 2, those sitting by the shooter would have seen bright muzzle flashes and known who shot the woman. I will say though that my wife and I have given up trying to figure out who the perps are on British shows because we are ALWAYS wrong!",1379721600,,641,4.136

I grew up knowing parents, uncles and cousins who served in the US Armed Forces during the war, in the Pacific and stateside. Foyle's War is superb at capturing the full flavor of English culture and understated aplomb during incomprehensible crisis. From the hairstyles to the woolen hose and sensible shoes, the fashions, furnishings, and even the wallpaper are right on the mark.  Particularly impressive is the concept of continuing to enforce civil law while war rages around Hastings, not allowing the despair of war overcome the need to remain a civil society. The entire series is extraordinary.",1376784000,,770,5.015625

3626720,5,B000MQCBSQ,"It touches on a wide variety of interesting topics:  class privilege, prejudices of many kinds, the lives of wounded veterans, love and loss, WWII history  that goes beyond battles and to the struggles 'back home'.  Good Brits, Good Germans, bad Brits, bad Germans and everything in between.  Very refreshing to see a lead in a detective show who is thoughtful, caring and extremely good at his job.",1376611200,,399,4.91044776119403
3626721,5,B000MQCBSQ,I am thoroughly enjoying this series. The setting of WWWII and the challenges people faced during that time are revealed a little as this detective investigates homicides. The character development progresses slowly and gradually. I have been drawn to them and appreciate their British ways.  Nice to watch a who dun it mystery without the twisted sick details of stories told about current day.,1376524800,,395,5.171875
3626722,5,B000MQCBSQ,Love the entire series.  The stories are addictive.  Great acting with personable characters.  The setting in England with all the local scenes makes the series difficult to resist.,1376524800,,181,5.392857142857143
3626723,4,B000MQCBSQ,This is a very 'British' detective show placed at the lead up to world war II.  The characters are interesting and the actors do a good job.  I am finding that my impression of English - American relations were not what I had previously believed.  The shows are slow moving but the lifestyle and attitudes are different and entertaining.  I suspect this series would appeal more to the older population.,1376524800,,403,4.714285714285714
3626724,5,B000MQCBSQ,Well written and acted - captures the time period very well.  Foyle plods away at each case with his able assistant and driver - fun to watch.,1376438400,,142,4.2592592592592595
3626725,3,B000MQCBSQ,"I just purchased the collector set of the 1st six seasons of Foyle's War.  I read the information regarding the product features very carefully and it clearly specifies that Seasons 1 - 5 are ""Closed Captioned for the hearing impaired."" (Season 6 indicates Subtitles.)  I have begun watching Season 1 and am extremely disappointed to discover that there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONING.  Coupled with the various English accents of the characters, this makes it very difficult to understand what is being said.  I often back up and play a section over again but even then a lot of the dialogue goes missing.
  I love British mysteries, classic English literature in film, British detective series and period series like ""Downton Abbey"" and ""Call the Midwife"".  I always verify the existence of subtitling before ordering, though, due to the difficulties mentioned above. In the case of Foyle's War, it's quite a let-down not to have the promised closed-captioning.",1376352000,,956,5.089743589743589
3626726,5,B000MQCBSQ,This is one great series from episode one thought out.  The interaction of the ensemble is fantastic!  The lead with his Sarah and wounded ex military Sgt. just have it going on.  Sgt's wife has to come around for it to be perfect!  Plenty of episodes left.,1376179200,,257,4.404255319148936
3626727,5,B000MQCBSQ,Foyle's War brings back a time I do not know but want to find out about. The programs show a way of life that called for patriotism and showed the fears of the population who did not know at that time what their fates would be. I think young people should watch these films so they will know what WW2 was about. There is such ignorance in the population today,1376179200,,359,4.142857142857143
3626728,5,B000MQCBSQ,A friend of mine told me about the show. One episode and I was hooked! Now I want to see all the previous seasons!,1376179200,,114,3.7916666666666665

3626730,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Great mystery.  Inspector Foyle is a policeman in WWII England who would rather be doing more for the war effort than being a policeman but it turns out that there is lots of crime that needs solving.  With air raids, food rationing etc., the episodes also show what it was like to live in England during this time in history.  Great acting.",1376092800,,341,4.467741935483871

Well-written, skillfully-acted, meticulously-researched!",1375574400,,380,5.981481481481482

3626744,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I absolutely love this British series.  The entire cast of main characters add value to this hugely popular detective murder sleuth series.  However, the quiet, humble, enigmatic nature of Foyle is just awesome.  Christopher Foyle lives with unbending morality and principles.  The character is a great example of a man who speaks little, and in so doing, perceives a LOT.  This is a great change from all the violent and sex-filled crime series blanketing the TV.  The setting is a small town in England during WWII.
And if you have Amazon Prime, you can watch the entire series for FREE!!!",1375488000,,591,4.86
3626745,5,B000MQCBSQ,Excellent series.  Be warned...you won't be able to stop watching. The historical accuracy is great and it forced me to look up WWII battles or exercises I never knew happened.,1375401600,,176,4.866666666666666

3626749,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This show is great because it is suspenseful and exciting. Every episode has a murder and Foyle always finds out who did it but throughout the entire show you see clues and you keep guessing yourself! Also, this show does a really great job with the character development. I'm very impressed.",1375142400,,292,4.745098039215686
3626750,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Michael Kitchen play the astute English Detective perfectly.  The scenery, houses, clothing and the beautiful cars take you back to the dark days of WW2 and murder.  Murder that only the British can turn into absolute enjoyment.  I does not matter to Foyle if he is sending his Son off to combat or confronting a murderer he does both with resolute calmness.  If you like or love British mysteries you will enjoy Foyle`s War.",1375142400,,425,4.702702702702703

3626763,5,B000MQCBSQ,My husband and I look forward to watching this series when we can together. It has interesting characters and written well. The main character along with his two co-workers go together to make it interesting to see how they solve each episode.,1374710400,,243,4.809523809523809

3626768,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Perfectly shot, great stories, moving but light - Foyle's War is an heir to BBC's classic series, Poirot.  It is a must watch for all mystery fans and for all those interested in WWII.",1374364800,,184,4.411764705882353
3626769,5,B000MQCBSQ,A friend recommended the series. We have just started on Series 1 and have enjoyed the first 2 episodes. Sound and picture were good streaming through our DVD Blu Ray player.  We will try to watch all the episodes sometime this year.,1374019200,,233,4.5476190476190474
3626770,5,B000MQCBSQ,"We have been watching this almost every night, after the kids go to bed; it's engaging, riveting, and one of the few murder mysteries that does not insult the viewer's intelligence with predictable, formulaic plotlines. The episodes do a wonderful job of tying together (a) fully fleshed-out characters-- Foyle is brilliant but perhaps too much a stickler for consequences; Sam is a woman who transcends most but not all of the cultural expectations of her age and gender; Foyle's injured assistant moves convincingly from personal degradation to dignity as Foyle puts his faith in him to help solve cases; and (b) broader themes of WWIi-era Hastings, with its growing ethnic prejudices and struggles to amass the materials needed to fight the Germans while keeping its civility amidst rationing, bombing and militarized zones.

It's also just great period fun, with the costumes and customs of the day realized fully on-set. I love the fact that each murder reflects both sociocultural themes and individual idiosyncrasies-- and we seldom can predict the whodunit until the end of the 1 hour 43 minutes, which is a feat!",1373760000,,1121,5.1256830601092895

At one point, when questioned about searching for a murderer on the South coast of England, when 50 miles away hundreds of thousands were killing each other on the beaches of France, Foyle says ""Isnt that the kind of thing we are fighting this war to defeat?

3626791,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I just started watching the Series, and I can't STOP watching.  Typical of the great masterpieces that the English produce.  Beside loving mysteries, I am fascinated with that period of time, as I was a little girl at that time and the Series incorporates the War and what was happening in England.  I would give this a 10 star if I could!",1372550400,,339,4.435483870967742

3626794,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I have only recently discovered this series, not through Masterpiece Theatre, but Netflix.

The plot lines are superb, and the characters are wonderful. It is always interesting because there are various events occuring as the story progresses, and being a mystery, it is quite clever.  From an historical standpoint, these episodes are a treasure.  Having read a great deal of the period when Britain stood alone during World War II, I find the historical background to be very accurate.  It is, indeed, like stepping back into England on a town on the coast while the war is going on.  It shows how much the British people sacrificed during those days.  The sets are superb, and every attention to detail is there.  And, unlike Hollywood, this is quality and not sensation, sex, absurd violence and hype.

The German Woman was the first episode I watched, and I was hooked after that.  Have emjoyed so many more.

I highly recommend all the episodes. I especially like Christopher Foyle's role so superbly played by Michael Kitchen.  And where, but England, would you find an actress (and a great one at that) whose real name is Honeysuckle Weeks?

Well, time for tea.  FIVE STARS",1371772800,,1182,4.85
3626795,5,B000MQCBSQ,"We heard a lot about this series and have watched the first 3 episodes of the first season so far. World War 2 is the backdrop here. But crime doesn't stop just because a war is going on across the channel. In fact, that war distills attitudes which result in the murders that Foyle must investigate. This is a very grown-up series and we look forward to watching additional episodes. The writing and acting are terrific; nothing has been sacrificed on the altar of political correctness. Highly recommended.",1371686400,,508,4.784090909090909
3626796,5,B000MQCBSQ,"World War 2 era mysteries.  Intriguing murders, spy-rings and espionage, and a variety of other mayhem in England.  Varied  dramatic situations surrounding both the folks left behind to deal with the emotionally draining and at times constant bombardment and other hardships of war and the returning, often-times heroes, the war-torn soldiers, back from the long fought battle. These  stories are done with exacting, historically correct scenes and costumes.  ""Foyle's War"" writer's do a great job on creating: broad, character' development, and plausible, exciting scenarios that draw you in.  Some of the best, truly heart felt, performances you will ever experience.",1371686400,,669,5.64

3626800,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is an amazing series from beginning to end. I love every episode. This is a look at the war, before we were in it, totally from England's point of view. The personal loss, the rationing of everything, needed just for everyday living. Not depressing, but so interesting, informative, and keeps you well attached to the storyline. It's a history lesson the American wouldn't necessarily know about. It tells that the Yanks weren't,always the ""long awaited heroes"" our old movies protrayed them as being. That's ok, because they were our boys, so I want my rose colored glasses, but it was interesting to see how thier history saw our boys arrival.  I love the characters, and how they allow us into thier personal lives,and not just about the crime of the day. I got to know them all, and will miss them terribly. I'm hanging on to the last show, because once I've seen it, they will all be gone forever, and I will be heartbroken.",1371340800,,934,4.626506024096385
3626801,5,B000MQCBSQ,"The Foyle's War series provided me with a fresh perspective on the political, economic, and social issues faced by Britain during WW 2. Difficult subjects dealing with social class, the black market, conscientious objectors, espionage, ethnic bigotry and violence, evacuees, Nazi sympathizers, interment camps are presented in a clear and forthright manner. Michael Kitchen's quiet,understated performance as DCS Christopher Foyle is elegant in its restraint.

I have been a fan of the shows on PBS, but have not seen all the episodes. Amazon Instant video has given me the opportunity to catch up on this quality programming.",1371168000,,626,5.453608247422681

I'm less into this genre but it has grown on me partly because of the work of the actors in the series ( really enjoy detective Foyle's character) and partly because it is different from what I typically watch on America TV.  It's also interesting to look into the past and see how life was in England during the second World War.  One thing that makes it particularly pleasant is that I don't have to suffer through commercials.  A tip of the hat to Amazon,  please don't ever change that.",1370908800,,634,4.517543859649122

I feel like I'm actually right in the middle of coastal England during the 40s, and experiencing the culture of those days.

3626903,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is the first of 6 seasons of Foyle's War.  All of the first season takes place in 1940.  The main characters are: Christopher Foyle's, a Detective Chief Superintendent or DCS, his driver, Samantha and his assistant, DS Milner.  Foyle is an exceptional detective, but he is not political and ruffles many feathers, which is why he has been posted to Hastings, south of London.  He believes that NO one is above the law and treats everyone with the respect they deserve, literally.  He and the other 2 main characters are very likable.

All the episodes involve several murders, not always done by the same person.  The nice thing about this series is that the viewer has all the information to solve the crimes, unlike some other series.  So, if you watch VERY carefully, you can solve the crime.  A plus.

In addition to the main plot and sometimes witty dialog, there is the added attraction of seeing what life may have been like in England during WWII.  Not everyone was a patriot.  The presence of foreign nationals from enemy countries, some benign, some not.  How they behaved and were treated.  What was precious and what was not.

A gripping series on many levels.

I strongly recommend watching it from start to finish and not skipping episodes, else you will miss some critical details which will keep you from appreciating and understanding all the nuances of subsequent episodes.

This is one if those few series that can be enjoyed over and over.  The episodes are sufficiently complicated, that unless you watch them all within a couple weeks, you can view them again, IMO not remembering enough to enjoy them again and maybe solve the mystery this time.

A true TV treasure.",1363046400,,1694,4.759450171821306
3626904,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Another good British series.  US writers seem to have lost the touch.  Brits can write a mystery without bomb, boobs, and bullets.  Good show.",1362787200,,142,4.833333333333333
3626905,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Watching these episodes is like being pulled back into history.  I'm no English expert on dress, cars, planes, facts about World War II but having all that as a backdrop in time from 1940 to 1945 makes the journey very interesting.  I'm always wondering where they got all the period cars and planes, typewriters, tools, telephones.  I've noticed details that bring back memories of my grandmother's jewelry or my mother's style of dressing, the music of the time.  Aside from the little village where Detective Foyle solves mysteries, the plots are diverse and tie in some way to what was happening at the time - WWII -- and how human nature hasn't changed at all.  There are the greedy, the people who think they are above the law, the crooked politicians and everyday crooks and of course the dead body, the robbery of which Foyle needs to get to the bottom to solve. I like the challenge of trying to solve his cases as he divulges facts throughout the 1.5 hour episode.  I'm never spot on.  Life is in the details and how Foyle strings them together like notes to a song in his quiet methodical way is what makes me wanting to watch yet another episode.  One of the by-products of visiting his little village of Hastings is the historical facts I was unaware of, like the blimpy balloons over buildings like hospitals that the Nazis should not bomb, and that rationing and getting food was a more terrible problem than I thought.  One of the ironic things is their class system doesn't change, even in war.  While people are losing their lives in London, the upper class had the money and mobility to move temporarily to the country where they continued with their tennis games and snobbery in a safer environment. The Black Market thrived, the ""bad guys"" found ways to loot gas meant for the military, and the infiltration of the Nazis was brought up with night visits by German submarines, and infiltrators rowing to shore.  The Nazi sympathizers were more present than I previously thought giving aid to the enemy.  Amid the chaos comes Foyle quietly working on keeping his little village safer and saner, but every once in a while making a decision that is not by the books, but by his assessment of human nature. And then there are the credits -- how can you NOT watch when actors are named Michael Kitchen or Honeysuckle Weeks for real??!",1362787200,,2349,4.647342995169082

The plots were good enough to usually keep you guessing... and surprised. I think that after the first three years creating a decent, fresh plot became more of a task.

It succeeds in being both well written and marvelously acted. Michael Kitchens' Foyle, ever understated and detached, is every bit as intriguing as Morse. The choice to use a small coastal village as a setting allows the series to have a true WW II background that would have been impossible if they had tried to use London.

I have watched so much FW over the past three weeks (was hooked on the first episode) that I am getting confused and starting to believe that Christopher Foyle, Sgt Milner and spirited 'Sam' are actually my family! I really wish they were. Sure, the plots to Foyle's War are intelligent, engrossing, and full of lovely twists and the period recreation is absolutely perfect, but it the central characters that hook you in; the wise, laconic Foyle, the brave Sgt Milner, and the daffy and delightful Sam Stewart become very 'real' very quickly, and curling up with an episode of ""Foyle's War"" is like sitting down to tea (or the cheeky glass of scotch oft-favored by Foyle) with old - and charming - friends.",1354406400,,789,4.72463768115942

3626961,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I enjoy the time period this series covers.  The time leading up to WW2 was quite tumultuous on the home front and often series tend to look more at what was happening in Europe.  Other times we see the harrowing events of the war (as in the film Atonement) but not so much of the individual lives while the war was raging.

The interesting aspects of this series are
1) The episodes are 100 minutes, so they are the length of a feature film
2) There are four episodes per series (season to us Yanks)
3) The criminal investigations are often tangent to the central story
4) The historic accuracy is very good in most scenes

The acting is quite good overall.  Some of the guest actors are very well cast and folks might recognize many from other series (such as Charles Dance - recognizable for playing Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones.  And the bad guy in Golden Child!)

The one complaint seems to be that many people find that the 'confessions' at the end of every episode a bit contrived.  I agree.  It seems that no matter what, Foyle figures things out and presents very circumstantial evidence that results in a confession by the culprit.  But this is in the style of many British detectives (like Holmes), so it's not out of place.  Also, the interesting part of this series is the search for clues and sorting through the facts and testimonies.  Once Foyle has it figured out, the viewer is ready to just have it end.  This isn't Law and Order, where Foyle will be building a case and then testifying in court and having lawyers and such.  The story arc is finished when Foyle has his 'aha!' moment.  The writers just figured that the best way to tie up the loose ends would be to have a confession by the culprit.  So even though it's contrived, it's forgivable.

I don't want to be too thorough with my review since it will probably be buried in the middle, but I just wanted to add one more positive review for a terrific series.",1352332800,,1943,4.428169014084507
3626962,5,B000MQCBSQ,"""Foyle's War,"" even as a title is provocative .It alludes to the larger global war which often affects Foyle's work, his son's life, and the community around them. As a detective, Foyle is the antithesis of the modern, fictional hero.  He carries no gun, has only one associate, and uses his brain, not his brawn, to fight crime.  There are no automobile chases or dramatic footraces, but his investigative work is quiet and thorough.  I am always surprised by the ending; the culprit is brought to justice by a series of clues to which the viewer is not always privy.  My only criticism is that I would be more engaged if I had enough information to make an intelligent choice about the crime and criminal.",1351900800,,707,4.632
3626963,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I came upon this series totally by accident. British television seems to be producing the only thought provoking drama these days. Foyle's War is subtle yet projects the complications of WWII without over simplifying. Detective Foyle is a man of high principles and a strong sense of right and wrong. There are even religious overtones in the episodes I've watched so far and shows the hideous, sometimes subvertly evil intentions of those who would sympathize with the Nazi invaders of London. Foyle stands his grounds on his principles as he goes about his detective work never wavering in his solid belief that what Germany is up to in WWII is nothing but evil.

3626967,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Foyle's War is one of the best-made series that I have ever seen. One of the things I loved most about this entire series was how it showed aspects of war-torn England that is not often depicted. Such as the intense fear of Germany's invasion on England soil, the removal of all road and rail signs (to delay the German's progress should they invade), the rescue at Dunkirk, and so much more. I feel like I got a huge history lesson even while watching a highly captivating detective series. And the stories themselves were rivetting! Michael Kitchen IS DCS Christpher Foyle forever, as far as I'm concerned. Some of the episodes (which are movie-length themselves) deal with mature themes (affairs, out of wedlock pregnancies, lots of pre-marital relation (only ever refered to, never actually seen), one episode reveals a homosexual but it is not a lasting theme, season 4 shows two ppl waking up in bed (NOT key characters), and she is obviously naked, seen from the side waste up, although nothing highly critical is shown, etc,etc).

My one qualm with the entire series is the amount of language. So, be prepaired for mature themes, lots of language and an otherwise amazing series!",1343865600,,1187,4.847290640394089

I am more of a fan towards the series that would appeal to an ""american"" audience, where more action, and a faster pace is present. I am accustomed to series like NIP AND TUCK, DEXTER, WHITE COLLAR, SONS OF ANARCHY,etc, so this series really had no appeal to me on an entertainement level. I barely got through the first disc, and couldn't finish the second one. all of this of course is my own personal opinion, since I am not a movie critic,neither am I trying to be one. This series will appeal to fans of Agatha Christie, or maybe of Sherlock Holmes, but if one is looking for a fast pace, action, intense dialogue....hum...look elsewhere.",1342483200,,764,4.464285714285714

The show employs the milieu of the day-to-day un-glamorous, unromantic world of World War II for plot points such as rationing of food, clothing, petrol, sweets, and able-bodied men. The writers seem to lose heart after season 4 and the stories go a bit tepid. But the chemistry between Foyle and his lovely driver Sam remains present, if quiet, throughout the series.

They have done a really good job of defining life during the war. Besides the story lines I enjoyed the cars, costumes, and the over all way of life in a small coastal town of England in the 1940s. The actors are very good and the stories are interesting. I was able to watch the first three seasons for free (as a prime member) but seasons 4 5 & 6 you have to buy. The price is a little to high at $7:99 per show. I do wish amazon would offer the complete collection to prime memebers not just half.

I'd much rather see more sleuthing and detecting and less of the characters' contrived personal problems.  Amazon Prime viewers beware!  Only the first three seasons are available to stream free of charge.  After that you can pay up to $7.99 for individual episodes.

3626988,3,B000MQCBSQ,"Really surprised by all the rave reviews.  I very much like this kind of thing, adore detective novels and movies etc etc, very into nostalgia...but I found this episode, the only one I've seen, a disappointment.  The plot is feeble and guessable, and the character of Foyle neither charismatic nor charming - just not very interesting. The issues they were dealing with, if handled well, could have been deeply interesting, but somehow they didn't make the most of them.  What about interning Jewish Germans as opposed to other 'enemy aliens' - was any policy formulated about this and was it for this reason that Foyle got Kramer released? He's so uncommunicative, it's hard to know.  It's true that sometimes you have to give a show a second chance - I wasn't crazy about the first few episodes of Doc Martin but then was hooked - but I'm not at all sure...Poirot is SO much more fun that the occasional feeble plot lines don't matter, but with this ...yawn...

OK, so now I've watched a couple more episodes.  Late at night, it's not bad viewing. I still think that the show is disappointing.  Plots tend to be implausible, with quick surprise solutions at the end (cf ending of 'lesson in murder') and there's a feeling of incompleteness as threads of plot here and there, different characters and their situations, are inadequately touched upon.  The viewer is kept at a distance from the sleuthing for the most part; not much insight into the way that Foyle and his assistant work together. Simpler, stronger plot lines would improve it.  Poirot often has feeble plots too, but you forgive that because of the wonderful atmosphere and humor that makes every episode fun to watch.  (Poirot is a great character to observe, as is Joan Hickson's Miss Marple and Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes.) So no, this is not up there with Poirot, although it aims higher in terms of the kind of subject matter it handles.",1329436800,,1914,4.755287009063444

Detective Chief Superintendent Foyle's character - exceptionally observant, calm, and just - makes a great lead.  He always keeps me guessing until the end!

Although the show sometimes covers adult subjects, the content is mostly descent.",1329004800,,460,5.0131578947368425
3626990,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I ran across Foyle's War on PBS somewhere around Season 3 or 4 and thought that the episodes I saw were among some of the best television I've ever seen.  I've kept my eye out for the series ever since, with the result that I've seen an episode here and an episode there, but never seen the series from start to finish, in order.  I am delighted that my Amazon Prime now let's me do that.  It's worth my $79.00.

I love the attention to period detail, and watching with the benefit of hindsight, the feeling of foreboding is palpable.  I just watched the episode dealing with the evacuation of Dunkirk.  The characters know that something huge and awful has happened, but I don't think anyone realizes the true enormity of the event.  Likewise, people are saying that ""not a bomb has dropped on London"".  They have no idea what lies in store for them.

Foyle's War is ostensibly a mystery series, but it's also a powerful depiction of England and the English at war.  Watch it.",1329004800,,977,4.468926553672317
3627001,5,B000MQCBSQ,"""FOYLE'S WAR: Sets 1-5"" presents British Home Front war-life through poignant topics, compelling suspense, and many mirthful moments. Masterpiece Theatre created a 6-year running (2002-2008) British mystery masterpiece. They outdid themselves.
It is a 1940-45 Southern England countryside experience not to be missed. It serves as a home-front view documentary of the English WWII involvement and resulting life-style of the population away from the active war front. This series begins in May, 1940 when all England expects an eminent invasion from Germany. You'll learn lots about the British WW2 home-war preparedness.

On the other hand, FOYLE'S WAR is a series of some of the best 21st century written murder mystery stories ever presented on television--or theater. An interview bonus feature with creator/writer Anthony Horowitz proves that the dual focus--mystery/period drama--was intentional from day one. The combined perfection is ""jolly good show."" It's hard to believe--but, 19 episodes comprising 32 hours is simply not enough of ""Foyle's War."" You'll want to move from #1 through to #19 without stopping to sleep. It's that good.

Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is a cop who'd rather be on the war front than investigating crime in Hastings, England. His cases, almost always murder, are quite involved, and never fail to end with a surprise--or two. I'll stick my neck out--Foyle's as good as Poirot. Foyle recruits help from an ex-soldier who lost a leg. Milner (Anthony Howell) manages to do much of Foyle's ""leg-work"" on an artificial limb.

Foyle is assigned a female driver, ""Sam"" for Samantha Stewart. She's a gorgeous red-head with a winning, million-dollar smile. Sam is as much fun watching in the series as her real name indicates--Honeysuckle Weeks (The Rag Nymph; Catherine Cookson book/movie classic, recommended!) She wins ""Miss Congeniality"" of the 1940s decade.

Perfect attention is given to the period details; sets, costumes, vehicles, architecture, even down to NO yellow road lines.
Both Foyle and Sam speak volumes of dialogue with nothing but facial expressions. Their performances are nothing short of superb. Perfection.

Additional guest cast members of each episode are well-known stars in their own right--following the tradition of some of the top Masterpiece Theatre productions. It is understood that Foyle will continue in a NEW post-war mystery suspense scheduled for perhaps a 2010 airing.
Closed Captioning

""FOYLE'S WAR"" is to British mystery what ""THE PALLISERS"" is to British political drama, OR what ""MONARCH OF THE GLEN"" is to Scottish Highland drama. After you've experienced Foyle's War, I recommend either of the other 2 series.

3627002,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is a very well written series from beginning to end. I am so glad I found this on amazon instant video. The stories are so well set up that you never can be quite sure who did it. And even if you do bet on the right horse early on, the stories themselves are interesting even without the mystery.  Foyle is a very progressive thinker, so much so that some of the ideas he expresses sometimes feel a little bit period - inappropriate. I think its the tremendous power of Michael Kitchen's superb performance that makes Foyle a sort of superhero in a snappy hat.  I think I had a crush by season 3.

I do hope they do an 8th series, I would love to see what happens next.  And that's really the thing isn't it?  And then what happened?",1326240000,,738,4.169014084507042
3627003,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Wonderful series which shows how life, and crime, continue to go on in southern England during WWII.  The series combines well written scripts with superb acting.  It is a unique and interesting murder mystery series!  I highly recommend it!",1325030400,,241,5.128205128205129
3627004,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Foyle's War is set in England during WWII. It starts just a little before the events that took place at Dunkirk. Currently there are Seven seasons in the series.

The stories focus on various crimes that Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is called upon to solve. Assisting him are his driver Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) and Detective Sergeant Paul Milner (Anthony Howell).

Det. Foyle is a widower who tries at the beginning to be more involved in Britain's War Effort doing some governmental work. He's informed his services as a detective are needed because crime doesn't stop just because there's a war on. Foyle has a son who is an RAF pilot.

He is assigned a driver, Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart, because Foyle doesn't drive and he recruits Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), a former police sergeant who has been badly wounded in action and has lost a leg, to aid him.

It's possible to watch episodes any way you want because they're pretty self-contained. However, there are story threads that run through the series - info. about each of the main characters - that you'll miss if you don't follow them in order. These threads are interesting, and help flesh the characters out, but they aren't necessary to the understanding of that episode's mystery.

Home life in Britain during WWII is portrayed very accurately. The shortages, the blackouts, the bombings, etc. serve as a backdrop to the various stories. The realities of the home front also make solving the crimes uniquely challenging.

The cases include spies, traitors, jilted lovers, and opportunistic thieves and murderers. The 'whodunit' and why at the end very often involve a twist that keeps you guessing.

I read someplace that the crimes are based on real events that happened during WWII.

I watched the series when it was on PBS. The only complaint I had was there were too few episodes per season. I was so glad to discover these on Amazon. I plan to obtain all the DVDs as soon as my finances are healthier.

I would suggest starting with the Pilot 'The German Woman'. I think it's pretty representative of the style to be found in the other episodes.",1323302400,,2168,4.885558583106267
3627005,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Some better than others, all ranging from excellent to superb, and all firmly and plausibly set in WWII.  This quiet series begins in 1940 and goes its quiet, gentle, inevitable way solving crimes of mischief and murder in Hastings while WWII rumbles around them and Foyle pines to be allowed to do something for the war effort. DI Foyle (Michael Kitchen) going his honorable, deliberate, careful way, stepping on the toes of superiors, Lords and anyone else who may think he is ""over stepping himself"" on the way, and always with the loyal support of Sam (Honeysuckle Weeks), his plucky driver, and Sargent Milner (Anthony Howell) and Andrew (Julian Ovenden), Foyle's son, an RAF pilot who appears in occasional episodes.  That tendency to put catching the criminal ahead of those toes he steps on occasionally is why he is still toiling away in Hastings instead of working for the war department.
These are finely honed stories, perfectly cast, and perfectly delivered.  We could all wish for all TV series to be this well done start to finish, with ""The Hide"" being, in my opinion, a crowning achievement.

Christopher Foyle is one classy man with quiet intrigue, subtle sarcasm, and distinguished good looks, the whole package!  I also fell in love with his driver, Sam Stewart, who is adorable.  She reminded me a lot of Megan Follows who played Anne Shirley in Anne of Green Gables.  Very delightful!  I have now viewed all the episodes in all 6 seasons and feel sad that there are no more to be watched.  I learned much about the 2nd World War and also gained a greater appreciation for the harrowing devastation that resulted.

3627010,3,B000MQCBSQ,"I bought this box of 4 stories from an Amazon Supplier and had it shipped directly from them to friends in Florida, as a gift,and telling them that my wife and I enjoyed the series on Public TV.  Bought new (unused), this series of BBC produced stories about Dep. Chief Inspector Foyle solving hometown crimes in England, at the beginning of WWII, was an outstandingly produced program of loving-created English setting and people in homeland conflicts---in the early days of World War II.  Great sets, acting, drama and polished storytelling.  However, my Amazon supplier had back luck in sending me the set that had some blemishes on the discs, and the original, full-color images and scenes were badly washed out and sometimes in fuzzy focus---- perhaps as a result of heavy over-use (in viewing) or simply aging of the discs.  So, it was a let-down as a gift goes, but the supplier provided me with a full refund and a hearty apology.  My advice:  by it used only from Amazon, and ""screen"" it first at your home before sending anythihng out as a gift.  It was my first gifting experience through Amazon--- but I'd do it again, a little differently.  Incidentally, I'd give Foyle's War (as a story) 5 stars.",1321228800,,1210,4.728571428571429

In view of my late appearance in the review history of this series,  I  will limit myself to recommending this set to those who enjoy the absence of noisome violence as a central script device and are attuned to thoughtful characterizations drawn by unsensational actors.

*The German Woman* -- As World War II looms over England, the Aunt and Uncle (an aged German professor of music living in Sussex) of a young English soldier are both incarcerated in a local internment facility -- the Aunt drops dead of a heart attack over her unjust captivity. The nephew personally appeals for his Uncle's release to a local Magistrate, his former employer, whose often unpleasant wife happens to have been a recent native of the German culture Sudetenland. Even though the brothers of the Magistrate's wife are full-fledged Nazis she has remained free of any significant restrictions due to a purported heart ailment but she rides her horse like the wind.

Meanwhile, a bored Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle's [Michael Kitchen] days are filled with investigating a cornucopia of war-related crimes ranging from profiteering to treason. All the while he worries about his only son, an RAF pilot-cadet. It's at about this time that the Magistrate's attractive wife is practically decapitated by a piano wire strung between two trees as she gallops her horse across her husband's vast estate.

Foyle had previously asked his superior officer (played by an aging but still very talented Edward Fox:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-of-the-Jackal/dp/0783226853/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day of the Jackal</a>.) for a transfer to a livelier assignment but then changes his mind in view of the murder case and at the prospect of unveiling widespread corruption within the local alien classification board of officials. But things aren't looking up for the Detective Chief Superintendent as his former beloved Sergeant [Anthony Howell as Sgt. Paul Milner] loses a leg in combat -- then Foyle is assigned a chatty and ebullient female driver [Honeysuckle Weeks as Samantha Stewart] who is initially not much to his tastes. But she soon proves herself to be a solid assistant.

*The White Feather* -- A mousey English servant girl astonishes everyone when she is arrested for sabotage, sacked as she is discovered cutting telephone wires. Soon the sleepy Sussex hamlet is astir with a pack of Nazi sympathizers who are conducting a meeting at the local hotel where the girl worked and which is operated by a man [played by the delightful actor, Paul Brooke,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Grace/dp/B00003CXMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Grace</a>] who resents his domineering wife's involvement with the group. One of this nefarious faction falls to murder and Foyle has to investigate. The anxiety of a prospective German invasion of England subtly, but effectively, boosts the dramatic mercury.

In the meantime, one of the hottest murder suspects, the servant girl's boyfriend, needs to be temporarily excused from the local jail to assist his fisherman father in participating in the boat flotilla rescue of the defeated English and French soldiers at Dunkirk, just across the English Channel.

*A Lesson in Murder* -- There was little public sympathy for conscientious objectors in England at the outbreak of World War II. One such young man is brought before a local board to decide his fate and the officials find his arguments to be unpersuasive. When he becomes disorderly at the hearing he is immediately jailed... where he is found hanging in his cell on the following morning.

During the same period, Foyle has the unpleasant task of investigating the murder of an inquisitive young boy, a war evacuee from London -- but was a local judge the real target? Foyle has to work it out.

*Eagle Day* -- A tenement house in London is bombed by the Luftwaffe and a man is found dead under the rubble with a knife in his chest!

Foyle's son is assigned to a top secret military project but is soon suspected of espionage.

Valuable art may be missing from a shipment to Wales where it's to be held for safety during the course of the war.

A reported suicide sounds very suspicious and more murder ensues. Foyle has a full plate!

Where does *Foyle's War* come down in the vast realm of British mysteries? One could categorically compare, in many ways, these superb episodes to those from The Golden Age of the genre: Christie, Marsh, Tey, Sayers, Upfield, Freeman, and so on. Everything for which we mystery lovers drool for within that savory literary genre seems manifest in the Foyle yarns - quaint rural settings, a focus on atmosphere, eccentric characters, subtle levity... on and on.

But what separates this praiseworthy screenwriting from the works of the Past Masters is, in a phrase, intricate complexity: dead-end subplots; multiple and non-traditional crimes; the backdrop of the sacrifices necessitated by war; a heightened focus upon justice; cultural actualities; a broader taste of forensic science... in other words, reality. In fact, if no murders whatever occurred during these episodes then the audience would still find the background stories to be compelling.

The crusty and elite characters (all portrayed by actors of The First Water), the manorial estates, the bubbling trout streams, the period hallmarks [Foyle discusses novelist Graham Greene with his infirm Sergeant at one point], the universal detritus of war - and so it goes.

If I sound somewhat overly-emphatuated or extremely enthusiastic about *Foyle's War* it's only because every one of these episodes is really that outstanding. We can easily buy into these mysteries and it seems as if we're revisiting a time and place where most of us have never actually been and which existed before most of us were even born.

My highest recommendation!",1301184000,,7251,6.002904162633108
3627016,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I just finished Foyle's War: Set 1.  It was fantastic!  I enjoyed the characters, the stories, and the historical and geographical settings.  I found these episodes to be completely watchable, and enjoyable, and I'm not even a murder-mystery fan...or I thought I wasn't.  For some reason, Foyle's War is different.

I think that Superintendent Chief Inspector Foyle (Michael Kitchen) is fantastic. He has the ability to speak volumes by making only miniscule changes to his expression, and without saying a word.  I also like ""Sam"" his driver.  She has grit, is spunky, and adds a great deal to each story.  Inspector Foyle's assistant is an Army sargeant who was disabled in a raid on Norway in early 1940.

DVD set 1 takes you from early 1940 through Eagle Day (Alder Tag), the first day of the Battle of Britain.

Foyle has deal with much more than just unsavory characters, he has to consider the war effort, his son in the RAF, the possibility of 5th column Nazis, black marketeers, and the whole gamut of complications that the onset of war brings.

5 stars all the way!  If you haven't seen Foyle's war, and either WWII murder-mysteries (or both) interest you, you will probably thoroughly enjoy Foyle's War (Set 1).

5 stars!  And on to set 2!!!",1299369600,,1253,4.7407407407407405
3627017,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I began watching mysteries during what now seems like the Golden Age of PBS's ""Mystery!"" series, in the 1980s.  Poirot, Marple, Peter Wimsey, Sherlock Holmes, Morse...  Great stuff.  I've never cared as much for the mysteries I've seen since.  Either the quality was uneven or the tone was so bleak that I didn't enjoy them.  Foyle's War finally gets it right--it succeeds in every way.  The production values are first-rate, the actors are terrific, the stories and characters are fascinating, and the tone is realistic without being depressing.  I love the chemistry between the principles, and the restraint shown in not pushing the camaraderie or comedy too far.  The humor comes naturally from the personalities and situations, not from contrivance.  The crimes and mysteries too flow from the period and the dislocations and anxieties of the war period, instead of having another whodunit laid arbitrarily on top of some superficial 1940's backdrop.  The war is everywhere, but is mostly shown in small domestic details instead of in battle scenes.  This series is a treat for history buffs, mystery fans, and anyone who loves good drama.",1295913600,,1144,5.129729729729729
3627018,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is a very good series for both fans of mysteries and history buffs.  It evokes the World War II era beautifully and offers insight into quiet details of life in Britain at this time.  Michael Kitchen is excellent in the title role, and gives a winning performance as he balances the character's depth and natural reserve with his deceptively simple approach to his job.  The mysteries are engaging and very intelligent.  They explore complex issues while they entertain, as well.",1294963200,,484,4.938271604938271
3627019,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is one of the best series you will ever see about what it was like living in England during the war.  The series centres on the life and work of a senior police officer on the south coast, Chief Inspector Christopher Foyle, played superbly by the brilliant Michael Kitchen.  He is well supported by the delightful Honeysuckle Weeks as his driver Sam and Anthony Howell as his war-wounded sergeant.

The acting is irreproachable; the attention to detail in the setting is equally so.  But none of this would matter if the scripts weren't up to it - but they are magnificent, written by Anthony Horowitz.

Each of the 100-minute episodes deals with a specific issue or problem of the times, often one of which we may have been quite unaware.  This first series deals with the murder of an Austrian woman, Nazi sympathisers, the death of a conscientious objector and a plot to steal art treasures being moved for safekeeping.

There are seven seasons in all, taking us to the months following the end of the war - and if anything, gets even better as it develops.  Not to be missed by lovers of and appreciators of the best of British drama.",1292716800,,1143,4.596059113300493

3627032,5,B000MQCBSQ,"All the story elements are present for an entertaining TV series: WWII era, mystery, personal conflict, British detective intrigue, southern England countryside villages, and authentic costumes. Lay on top of that, outstanding writing (Anthony Horowitz) and acting (Michael Kitchen, Honeysuckle Weeks, Anthony Howell), and you've got ""Foyle's War"".

Series I consists of four episodes that introduces and then slowly develops the main characters with a subtlety that sets British drama apart.  Rather than spelling out the character's personality and back-story quickly, the viewer is given a glimpse into their lives, and then little by little the depth and connections are further developed within each episode.

Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle is the quintessential steady, determined, low key, and close-to-the-cuff British detective whose simple statements belie the thinking behind the man. Kitchen masterfully portrays the nuanced emotions of Foyle through facial, and body motions that are consistently delivered. Samantha `Sam' Stewart played by Weeks, is perfect as Foyle's driver for her ability to portray the odd mixture of humor, enthusiasm, navet and an old soul quality to her character. Howell does a fine job in his portrayal of Detective Sergeant Paul Milner by conveying both the assistant's calm professional diligence and personal melancholy.

Both the mystery to be solved and the personal lives of the characters come together to deliver an enlightened and satisfying portrait of the English home front in the early days of the war.",1282262400,,1573,5.6525423728813555
3627033,5,B000MQCBSQ,"In ""Eagle Day"" we see Foyle's headstrong RAF pilot son, Andrew, accused of being a traitor, a lorry driver for an art gallery ending up with a knife in his chest, a secret RAF base where the newly-minted radar is being tested, and a famous art collection that is being moved out of London for protection against destruction by Nazi bombers. But who knows if some of those art works are really being stored safely, or are they being plundered right there on British soil? We hear about the mysterious death of a young woman, a WAF, killed in a train accident.
All the regular cast is assembled. Sergeant Milner can now get around without a cane. Samantha, Foyle's military driver, known by one and all as Sam, is still playing at being a detective and her clerical father wants her safe at home. Foyle's son is flying Spitfires fearlessly at a secret local base and is fond of the ladies.
Andrew has a dicey university friend and may have committed an indiscretion in his university days. Andrew can't tell his father about the cloak and dagger stuff he is involved with in the RAF. Foyle goes to London to see the curator of the museum-gallery that has been safeguarding art work in Wales away from Jerry bombers. A locket provides a valuable clue. A hard-of-hearing older man gave directions to a stranger in a blackout before an air raid.
On the radar base Andrew susses out that people are very nervous and afraid to talk about Lucy, one of the WAF radar plotters who is gone.
Plot and counter-plot, intrigue, suspects, spies, all are part of the mix. As viewers get deeper into this fine series we learn more about Foyle, Sam, Milner, and Foyle's son Andrew. They become almost family members as we follow their evolution. If you're like me, you'll get hung up on the period, the war experience, the authentic details like carrying a gas mask around. Each plot is full of twists and turns, and grabs you.",1282003200,,1908,4.581871345029239
3627034,5,B000MQCBSQ,"""The German Woman"" is the first episode of the first year of the British TV series ""Foyle's War"". The plot focuses on the wife of a wealthy, influential official. The woman of German extraction is getting preferential treatment because of her husband's position and power. Germans living in Britain were classified as aliens, and if they lived within five miles of the coast, they were supposed to be evacuated and interned because they were deemed to be a threat. The wife was permitted to stay in the family mansion and carry on her regular activities which included energetic horseback riding. The excuse for her being allowed to stay was that the family doctor had certified that she wasn't well enough to be moved.
Police Detective Chief Inspector, Christopher Foyle (subtly delineated by Michael Kitchen) wants to serve in the forces, but his commander says that ordinary crime such as murder will continue despite the war and must be investigated. In the series many of the murders that take place are motivated by wartime events and the upheavals brought about by a nation under siege. It starts in England in 1940 during World War II. Anti-German sentiment ran high during the war, and this hatred percolated into murder. Thus we have Foyle, the civilian cop, doing his necessary job to solve a crime.
This episode has a complicated but easy-to-follow plot with many nooks and crannies. We see Foyle's first meeting with his perky and inquisitive female military driver, Samantha, called Sam (played by Honeysuckle Weeks). She turns out to be a good detective. He also hires on Sergeant Milner who has lost a leg in the war. Foyle's university son is headed for RAF service.
It's a neat plot with a good helping of suspects and two murders. The episode has beautiful views of the bucolic countryside and outstanding acting. Edward Fox plays a cameo role. The series hallmark is authenticity. People carry their gas mask bags; we see the vintage vehicles, clothes, railroad trains, and see the importance of radio in a pre-TV period.",1282003200,,2041,4.918840579710145
3627035,5,B000MQCBSQ,"""A Lesson in Murder"" is the third episode in the first season of ""Foyle's War"" and it centers on pacifism and conscientious objectors.
David Beale is testifying before a tribunal to determine whether he'll be granted conscientious objector status. This event is not too long after the Dunkirk evacuation which has had a tremendous impact on the British population. The tribunal is chaired by Judge Gascoigne. They deny Beale c.o. status and he loses his temper. He's arrested and taken to prison where he is treated very roughly by the guards. His wife witnessed the tribunal proceedings. She returns to her pacificist group and talks to David's friend, fellow pacifist Theo. That night David hangs himself.
Foyle is brought in to investigate the case. He gathers evidence which shows that one of the guards was instrumental in the maltreatment of Beale, so he arrests the guard. Foyle's job as a policeman often is often at odds with his patriotic beliefs, but he is a principled and honest cop.
Gascoigne lives in a mansion with his wife, Emily, and daughter, Susan. He's a nasty and domineering person. The daughter has talked her father into taking in Joe, a boy evacuated from the London bombing. Joe loves to play detective, and he documents what he sees in his exercise book.
Gascoigne`s life is threatened. Suspects are coming out of the woodwork. There's Peter, Susan's suitor whom her father has forbidden her to see. There's Jack whom Gascoigne as a judge has sentenced to a prison term. There's Theo, the pacifist.
Sergeant Milner's problems with his cold-hearted wife grow more dire, and she takes off for a few weeks in Wales to get away from him.
The boy Joe is killed when he noses around in a summerhouse. After his murder, Sergeant Milner is moved into the house to protect the judge. Something seems to be developing between Milner and Susan.
Sam is still chauffeuring Foyle around and using her considerable detection skills. There's an Italian thread to the story which leads to mob violence, and viewers will be shocked when they see a panoramic shot of the factory where Peter works.
When it comes to tidying-up time/the solution, viewers may find that the solution seems somewhat off-the wall and barely credible.",1281830400,,2237,4.905013192612137
3627036,5,B000MQCBSQ,"In ""The White Feather"", the second episode in the first season of ""Foyle's War"", it's May of 1940. Hitler's armies are blasting through Europe, and it looks as if Britain may be invaded in weeks. The British expeditionary force in Europe is being forced closer and closer to the Channel. In London a group of fascists, the Friday Club, are masquerading as pacifists and are pro-Hitler. They welcome a German takeover. At the beginning we see Foyle's newly hired police Sergeant Milner who had lost a leg in the war attending by chance a club meeting in London.
Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Foyle (brilliantly portrayed by actor Michael Kitchen) has to carry on regular police activities as the war rages around him and as his son begins his pilot service in the RAF.
In this episode in the south of England, Foyle's civilian police duties chasing criminals get inextricably blended with wartime and political themes. A young woman, Edith, is cutting telephone wires near a service base, endangering British troops. She is arrested on sabotage charges and could face the death penalty. No one can figure out why a young woman with no political opinions or affiliations would do such a thing. Foyle investigates, and the trail leads to the White Feather Hotel run by the Ellises where she was a chambermaid.
Mrs. Ellis, a pro-Nazi, has to accept a Jewish guest because he made advance reservations. Her son who loathes and fears her finds a pistol in the guest's room and tells his father. She has invited the Friday Club to a gathering in her hotel. Guy Spencer, the leader of the club and his guests gather in the hotel for a private meeting. The lights go out, and Mrs. Ellis is shot with bullets probably meant to kill Spencer.
This TV film will capture your interest as you watch its many plot strands play out. Foyle is driven around by a army women's corps chauffeur, assigned to him, Samantha Stewart, nicknamed Sam (played by Honeysuckle Weeks); she's very attractive, very bright, and wants to be an active detective. Sergeant Milner, Foyle's assistant, has two burdens to bear, his friendship with Spencer which leads Foyle to think he may be a Nazi sympathizer and the callous behavior and attitude of his wife because of his handicap.
This TV episode has a novelistic sweep to it with all of its complex intertwined themes and its depiction of the horrific Dunkirk evacuation. The series is filmed in southeastern England in the village of Hastings.
When it comes to tidying-up time/the solution, viewers may find in this episode and in ""A Lesson in Murder"", that the solutions seem somewhat off-the wall and barely credible. But in getting to that point we've been taken on a great ride with believable characterization, clever plotting, and a lot of insights into the human condition.",1281830400,,2806,4.860125260960334

Began viewing ""Foyle"" a few months ago when PBS started running series 5 & 6, the most recent. I found the basic premise (an English police detective fighting ""man's inhumanity towards man"" on the home front during WWII), in a word, fascinating. At the end of the day, evil never ceases being evil, and it can be found lurking anywhere. Relatively quiet, small towns like Foyle's Hastings are not immune, even while WWII is raging elsewhere. The writing, music, overall production value, and particularly Michael Kitchen's understated yet brilliant performance as Foyle, make this a must-see series. I would not relish being on the wrong side of the law with Christopher Foyle after me. I have purchased the first 2 sets in the series, and have seen most of series 5 & 6 (they do not disappoint). I plan to own all of them eventually. Foyle's War easily joins the upper strata of English detective series like Morse, Midsomer Murders, and A Touch of Frost.

3627042,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is an episodic murder mystery series. If you are a fan of this genre, such as Colombo, then you should enjoy. The primary character, Superintendent Detective Foyle is serious, thoughtful, probing, understated and relentlessly devoted to the unflinching exposure of truth and justice, without regard to the interruptions posed by WWII. Foyle tried desperately but unsuccessfully to join the military, so he must be content to fight the war from the home guard position and the setting is pastoral, rural England during WWII.

This is quintessentially British fare, with each episode connected to a particular time period of the war and how the war intrudes on the lives of the local populace. A story within a story.

The attention to detail in recreating the environment is marvelous, something along the production level of Mad Men, and provides a good dose of history and nostalgia throughout.

3627047,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I enjoy British TV on the whole more than American, and FOYLE'S WAR is one of the best examples of why. Fantastic acting, compelling story telling, and a carefully nuanced perspective that allows the viewer to make up their own minds about moral/political questions without having one shoved down their throat. The show is very well put together with a strong supporting cast, lovely cinematography (including some fantastic shots of a Supermarine Spitfire in flight), and well designed murder mysteries, all of which are painted on a much broader canvas than typical who-done-it shows: the English home front during WWII. Combining all the essentials of great storytelling and good TV, Foyle's war is quite simply one of the best TV shows I've ever seen.

Michael Kitchen plays the stalwart Inspector Foyle, a man who would rather be at the front than pursuing murderers on the domestic side. However, Foyle does not let his supervisor's refusal to transfer him to a military roll take away from his purposeful and intelligent crime solving. An understated 'gentleman's gentleman,' Foyle is not a typical crime solver with a big personality (Lord Peter Wimsey or Hercule Poirot for example). He is more similar to P.D. Jame's protagonist Adam Dalgliesh: principled, but with a poetic side. Kitchen brings out subtleties of humor, sadness, and loyalty to a protagonist that might otherwise have been a bit of a wet-fish character.

A terrific supporting cast rounds out the show nicely, with solid performances by Honeysuckle Weeks as Inspector Foyle's driver Samantha Stewart, Anthony Howell as Detective Sergeant Milner, and Julian Ovenden playing Foyle's son Andrew. Of these, Weeks really stands out as the brash, joyful, and always surprising Sam, an MTC (Mechanized Transport Corps) driver assigned to Foyle (who does not drive--this is not explained in series 1, but is mentioned in other seasons) despite his initial objections. She is the perfect 'foil' for Foyle and is responsible for most of the humor in the show.

Foyle's war is not just a series of murder mysteries. An examination of the human condition, it aptly captures all of our best and worst traits. Set in the midst of such a polarizing event as WWII, we are shown a wide variety of response to the intense pressures of war: bravery, kindness and wisdom alongside foolishness, pettiness, and bigotry. All are on display here, but without a moralizing tone to lead the viewer towards obvious conclusions.

Convincing, sincere, and very, very well done, Foyle's war is TV done nearly perfectly. It will instantly appeal to any mystery fans--especially British mystery--but shouldn't be pigeon-holed as merely for mystery lovers: the stories, acting, and dramatic elements should capture almost anyone.

5/5. Highly recommended without any reservations whatsoever.",1245628800,,2835,5.23568281938326
3627048,4,B000MQCBSQ,"Beautifully photographed series with very good acting.  The greatest value to the series for me has been the insights into how a constant condition of war touches and affects every aspect of the ordinary lives of non-combatants.  We never stop and think, for example, how casket making becomes a wartime priority, or how valuable junk metals (tin cans) can be.

The story lines are always interesting and keep your attention.  There is a bit of Deus ex machina when the plot is wrapped up.  Foyle usually reveals some critical piece of knowledge that has been withheld from the audience or else something happens that causes everything to fall into place.  That said, the plots are interesting, the characters well portrayed and the series well worth watching.",1240790400,,760,4.992063492063492

The locales, beautifully restored autos and aircraft, period sets and costumes take you easily into this historically-based world and the wonderfully complex intertwining of plot and character.

We missed some of the episodes in this set when watching on TV, and are glad we got the set as the full widescreen production upscaled beautifully on our HD set.  Will no doubt purchase the rest of the series eventually.

Only disappointment is that with our DVD player connected via HDMI to our HD set, we were not able to view closed captioning and no subtitles are available.

3627050,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This series is so good that I am re-posting my review of the entire series here as well. You should not miss the series.

I have an Anglophile fondness for British literature, British detective stories and British TV detective series. I recently came across a phenomenally good series called Foyle's War. The show stars Michael Kitchen as Detective Chief Superintendent (DCS) Christopher Foyle, a frustrated detective in the backwater of Hastings who would rather be serving more directly in the war effort. Things have been quiet in Hastings for the past millennium since the Invasion of England, 1066.

Fortunately for us, the British government turns down his requests for a transfer and he goes about solving murders and other crimes in East Essex on the southeast coast. His driver is a young woman with the unlikely name of Sam Stewart played an actress with the even more unlikely name of Honeysuckle Weeks. His sergeant is a vet who lost his leg in Norway.

Foyle's demeanor and doggedly persistent approach to solving crimes is one attraction. The back story of England during the war and the meticulous attention to detail is another. The era is rich in subject matter, some of it surprisingly fresh (did you know about English detention camps for alien residents?), some of it expected but done very well (for example, the series treats rationing, shortages, secret military operations, the arrival of the Yanks, war fatigue, black markets, and of course, the bombings).

Kitchen was marvelous as the prince/king in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Cards-Trilogy-House-of-Cards-To-Play-the-King-The-Final-Cut/dp/B00009MGGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Cards Trilogy (House of Cards / To Play the King / The Final Cut)</a>&nbsp;and is even better here. But as with the Wire, while the acting is superb and production quality is top notch, it is the writing of Anthony Horowitz (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-One/dp/1569385882/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders - Set One</a>) that really sets the series apart.

While I still consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wire-The-Complete-Series/dp/B001FA1P1W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wire: The Complete Series</a>&nbsp;the best TV show ever, Foyle's War has taken second place by such a log margin that I'm not even sure what number three is. Foyle's War is a good deal more accessible than The Wire, i.e. watch any episode from any season and you will not only be entertained, but you will also have a good grasp of what is going on - not the case with The Wire.

Having rapidly worked my way through the first four seasons' worth of DVDs, I find myself reluctant to watch the last two episodes because I don't want it to end (But, hey, I can start over and watch them again!).

Drop the English reserve; Foyle's War gets my unreserved highest recommendation.",1235260800,,2998,5.769230769230769

However, that said, most good series know when to stop.  There will not be one episode that disappoints or does not keep your rapped attention for the full hour.  Michael Kitchen is a great actor and does a splendid job as well as Sam his driver.  The interplay among the main charaacters is well done without being overdone as so many US series are these days.  You will not regret owning all 5 seasons.",1233273600,,624,4.254237288135593
3627052,5,B000MQCBSQ,"2003's ""Foyle's War: Set One"" is the introductory set of episodes of a marvelously crafted police procedureal set in World War II Britain.  World War I veteran and Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Foyle is marooned in the sea-side town of Hastings, hunting criminals instead of helping with the war effort.  Foyle will discover that criminality takes no holiday for the war; in fact, the war effort becomes a convenient cover for all kinds of mischief.

Michael Kitchen plays Foyle as a mature, stoic, and dedicated police officer, determined to enforce the laws in the midst of wartime.  At the same time, he is a compassionate man challenged by the injustices and sacrifices imposed by the war effort.  The result is a series of murder cases wrapped in one or another moral gray area.

Foyle is assisted by Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks), his young and plucky military driver, and by Police Sergeant Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), just returned to duty after a painful stint with the British Army in Norway. Foyle's son Andrew, a young RAF pilot played by Julian Ovenden, is a recurring character in the series, who highlights the widowed Foyle's austere personal life.

Episode One centers around the murder of a Austrian woman who is married to a local magistrate.  The woman and her husband turn out to have lots of enemies, some related to the forced internment of German civilians.

Episode Two explores the connections of a young woman, arrested for sabotage, to a group of Nazi sympathizers and their mysterious, deadly meeting at a Hastings Hotel.

Episode Three finds Foyle investigating the death of a conscientious objector in police custody and the surprising murder of an evacuated child staying with a wealthy family.  The episode explores the difficulties of being a conscious objector in wartime and what happens to an old friend of Foyle's when Italy enters the war.

In Episode Four, Foyle probes the mysterious murder of a truck driver during a bombing attack, while Foyle's son gets himself into trouble on his first assignment, a hush-hush job that may hide a suspicious death.

""Foyle's War"" is pitch-perfect in its detailed presentation of wartime Britain and in confronting the painful struggles on the home front. The murder mysteries are deliberately paced and reliably difficult to solve, usually with emotionally painful outcomes.  If the story lines sometimes stretch to connect characters to larger events, the overall effect is worthwhile.  ""Foyle's War: Set One"" is very highly recommended to fans of PBS Masterpiece Mystery as first rate entertainment.",1230422400,,2603,5.1350710900473935
3627053,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I watched every episode of Foyle's War when it was on PBS' Mystery series. The episodes are extremely well-written, and the acting is excellent. Michael Kitchen, the series' eponymous character, has a taut, low-key style. Yet, he exerts himself as a forceful lead actor. Foyle is a chief inspector of a relatively small, but strategically important, English sea coast town during WWII. So, there's murder and wartime intrigue in each Foyle's War episode.  I bought the 1st season as a Christmas present present for my brother. He saw but one episode and loved it.

3627057,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Take one of the most compelling, yet excessible times in modern history: England, during World War II. Mix in an intelligent, complex murder mystery & you have Foyle's War. Michel Kitchen is Christopher Foyle, the middle aged Detective Chief Superintendent of Hastings, a seaport south of London. He has been turned down repeatedly for active duty at the outbreak of the war. He is considered too valuable on the home front as the top cop in the area. England is expecting an invasion by the Germans before & after the disaster at Dunkirk. The first season consists of four 100 minute episodes (no commercials). Each of the four episodes closely follows real events from the war, starting chronologically from 1940 to 1945 in the fifth season. In the pilot ""The German Woman""  Foyle investgates the murder of a German national. Real events such as internment of Germans living near the coast, fear of invasion, hatered of anything or anybody German & the first taste of the bombing to come. Also covered in the first season, The Itailian declaration of war, antisematism, spies, terrorist & so much more. Foyle is disturbed by the new indifference people demonstrate over the individual murders of innocent people he must still investigate given the dying of thousands, a mere 30 miles away accross the channel. He is helped by his new driver, (he doesn'tdrive) Sam, (Honeysuckle Weeks)a ""plucky"" young lady who helps in many ways he can't even imagine. His
assitant, Paul, (Julian Overdon) is a severely injured vet from the ill-fated Norwegian invasion.

 I found the casting to be right on.  The period depiction of the time period are historically correct.  The episodes are well developed and relevant to its time period.  Foyle is a Detective Inspector living in Hastings who quietly solves crimes and sets all records straight.  Remember Foyle looks beyond the obvious.  He uses all his resources.  He is a student of human behavior.  Foyle proves to be an enigma to all in his approach to solving crimes.  These  four serials are indeed grand.

If you like WWII, detective mysteries, and character driven shows this is almost perfection. I can't recommend this highly enough.

The Anthony Horowitz scripts are consistently superb.  The period details are scrupulously evoked.  (Part of the problem with the series is its cost.  Each episode requires the extinguishing of road lines, the altering of signage, and a host of other touches in addition to the period costumes, cars, farm implements, and so on.)  The fundamental concept is excellent--the so-called history meets mystery conceit.  However, many historical mysteries are exaggerated, with over-the-top or stereotypical characters and bizarre events.  Here, the actual facts of WWII meet the brutal realities of wayward humanity.  Kitchen is the center piece and his acting is consistently astonishing in its economy and precision.  He acts with his eyes and the slightest movement of his lips.  A single word speaks paragraphs and the swirling emotions within are controlled and canalized.  The supporting cast are excellent and the guest members of the ensembles consistently first-rate.

3627075,4,B000MQCBSQ,"I avoided this series because of the title, when in reality it's not a war drama, but more of a Midsomer Murders meets the 1940s, liberally sprinkled with a touch of preachiness.  As much as I enjoy the series, I have to admit that's true.  They do go overboard with the message on occasion.  Season 1 has four episodes:

The German Woman - This pilot episode, this one serves to introduce the main characters (Foyle, Stewart, Milner).  There is a murder, which takes the characteristic 'too many suspects, so little time' route.  Foyle patiently solves it while rising above the petty anti-German sentiment (lesson the first).  Both the historical accuracy and attention to details are superb, the acting is wonderful, and the storyline (despite the lesson) moves along nicely.

The White Feather - There are two mysteries twined together in this episode - the telephone wire cutting maid and the hotel owner who ends up murdered.  Both seem to have their roots in the pro-Nazi group (the Friday Club), but looks can be deceiving.  Also, we see Milner in a not-so-pleasant light for a bit, which is depressing but perhaps more realistic.  There are plenty of bits of lessons learned in this episode, though they can be somewhat overlooked with the exception of the boat captain and his son, which was predictable and a bit over-the-top.

A Lesson in Murder - If you don't want to hear an awful lot of preachiness about conscientious objector status, avoid this episode.  Though I think the ultimate fate Theo Howard was very interesting...  But I digress. The murder is a twisted tale, starting with an act of evil that baffles the mind.  Along the way there are plenty of red herrings and side stories, enough to keep it lively and interesting but not so many to distract.  We learn more about Milner and his personal life, as well, which serves to round out the character nicely (and is important in a later episode).  There is a bit of unnecessary sadness (though it is war) at the end that dishes up another lesson in the evils of mob mentality that the show could have done without.

Eagle Day - Two mysteries for the price of one!  Foyle is dealing with a strange murder and the possibility of art theft, and his son is dealing with a very serious situation of his own.  A little heavy handed on the 'anything for the war effort' mentality, the episode still amazes with its bizarre twists, seemingly improbable connections, and surprising revelations.  The bit about Sam is trite and a little smarmy, but is a small bit and can be overlooked.",1213574400,,2550,4.711060948081264

3627077,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I have jsut discovered Foyle's War and have found it to be an ezceptional portrait of Great Britain in World War II.  We tend to forget that along with the military aspect of this time frame, the civilian sector was still turning over.  As a result, law enforcement didn't stop but actually was stepped up as new laws relating to the war were introduced and enforced.  Along with the struggle against Germany there was also the struggle against crime such as murder, theft, black marketing and any number of of there everyday crimes that needed solving.  Michael Kitchen is excellent as Inspector Foyle.  He is quiet but underneath is watching and listening to everything that is done and siad, and that which isn't, around him and to him.  His team of a woman driver, doing her bit for the war, and a returned veteran of the Norwegian fiasco complement his style very nicely.  They disagree with Foyle and he listens and sometimes accepts their point of view.  The historical background is excellent to make the events protrayed more understandable.  I the first series, in one episode at the conclusion an RAF radar station is bombed.  This was the beginning of the Battle of Britain when the German air force pounded the radar stations along the coast of England in preperation for the bombers to come along undetected.  Casualties amongst the crews there were heavy - most of them were women since they were used as radar plotters.  This isn't directly shown, but only by inference which is even better because you have to think about it.

The series takes place in rural England during World War II, the main character being Chief Superintendent Foyle. In every episode there is a murder, but you also watch the war's progression and the story of each character develop further. The ending to the episode (the classic ""here's what happened"" scene), always makes sense. Unlike other detective/mystery shows I have seen, there is never an ending thrown at you out of left field. There are enough clues during the episode that it all makes sense, yet you probably didn't figure all of it out yet - something I have yet to find in most other shows. Each episode contains a rare combination of mystery, humor, drama and good storytelling.

The acting is so far above average, that you feel as though you are right there in Hastings, England, right before and during WWII.  It serves as both a historical piece and a mystery series.  Michael Kitchen acts the part of Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Foyle in a great way.  His sidekick and driver, Sam Stewart, played by Honeysuckle Weeks, adds a touch of humor and shows the caring and pateral side of DCI Foyle.  Anthony Howell gives a great performance as his war-wounded sergeant and Julian Overden plays a remarkably believable role as his son.  The scenes are shot in a way that make them look older and the props seem to be extremely authentic.

3627085,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is a beautifully done series, typical of the British.  There are only 4 episodes in each season (there are 4 seasons available as of this writing), but each one runs as long as a feature film (running around 100 minutes or so).  It is extraordinarily well written (even more so than by the high quality British standards), and it covers a fascinating terrain.  Michael Kitchen plays Chief Inspector Foyle, a police officer working during the WWII years.  Not only does Foyle have to deal with the typical police work, but the war plays a big factor in his daily functions.  In the first episode, the killer (I won't say who) works in the home office, and is trying to decode a German spy ring.  He tells Foyle about the important work he is doing, and says that the murder he committed is inconsequential because the country needs him (which is actually true).  The series has tons of these moral dilemmas and ambiguities running through it.  It also deals with anti-Semitism, xenophobia (which is dealt rather poignantly in the final scenes of the 3rd episode, A Lesson in Murder), disillusioned soldiers, and restless natives who don't like being harrassed by police.  In other words, the usual stuff that occurs in wartime.  The tribulations that Foyle must transverse are absolutely fascinating.  The performances are first rate and wonderfully understated (contrast Michael Kitchen and this cast's wonderful performances with the histronics and over the topness in Fox's 24), and the episodes are leisurely and nuanced.  Nothing is ever rushed, but it is never boring.  A superb series.",1186358400,,1596,4.977358490566037

3627088,5,B000MQCBSQ,"""Foyle's War,"" yet another superlative British series of mysteries, this time combined with historical drama, made its American debut on February 2,2003.  Created and written by Anthony Horowitz, an astonishingly young and prolific writer, it's now gone off air in the United Kingdom. (In its chronology, the allied armies are already in preparation for D-Day in Set 4, which we've just seen here: that doesn't leave much more war for its final Set 5.  And, apparently, there's no appetite anywhere for ""Foyle's Peace."")  So a look back at the first set is timely.

""The German Woman"" was the first episode in that first set.  This telescript was actually written, sold, and filmed as a standalone, before all concerned parties realized that, with the characters of World War II Detective Chief Inspector Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen, ""Reckless,"" ""Oliver Twist,""), his charming driver Samantha Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks), and steadfast Sergeant Milner (Anthony Howell), his second in command, they had the makings of a superior series.  This first episode is a good predictor of what's to come: tightly written scripts providing a mystery or two, intrigung material about the British home front during the war, and resonant characters creating compelling situations.  The shows are beautifully filmed on location in London, and around Hastings, on England's south coast, where Foyle is supposedly stationed; the area most vulnerable to a possible German invasion.  Direction is powerfully unobtrusive.  There are many speaking parts, all with top-drawer casting, and there's no stinting on the extras, the costumes, the cars, the blackout curtains or general set dressing, either.

This first episode deals with a little-known facet of Britain's World War II, the imprisonment of those immigrants living near the coast deemed possible ""enemy aliens.""  It also illustrates the wartime difficulty of obtaining even water, and clothing (rationing allowed one change of clothing per annum): throughout the series, Foyle, as played by Kitchen, a small man, wears a black leather coat many sizes too large for him.  We're told that Foyle, a middle-aged London cop, would prefer to be part of the war effort, but is deemed too valuable by his superiors to be allowed to go.  Luckily, Foyle does believe that, even in wartime, a crime is a crime.  Kitchen was apparently the first choice to play Foyle; beyond him, the cast features Edward Fox and Robert Hardy.  The citified, unable to drive Foyle (also, by the way, the name of a famous London bookstore), is assisted by a driver, and the sturdy Sgt. Milner, who lost a leg in Norway.  (The Norway reference epitomizes the series' deep commitment to war history: in its earliest days, Churchill sent troops there in an ill-fated effort to stop the Nazi invasion.)  This episode also introduces it's author's habit of using family relationships to power the emotional kick of his writing: we see one father/daughter conflict, several father/son relationships -- Foyle's son is in the Royal Air Force-- and one quasi father/son story, an uncle and his nephew.

""White Feather,"" the second episode, is, for my money, the finest of them all.  In addition to the regulars, it boasts a large cast of well-known theatrical and film actors, headed by Charles Dance (""White Mischief,"" ""Aliens."") It gives us a high-voltage war story about the notorious fifth column of Nazi sympathizers active early in the war, and the espionage and sabotage for which they were responsible; and the legendary evacuation, by every south coast fishing vessel and pleasure yacht, across the English Channel, of the British troops trapped before an advancing German army at Dunkirk, on the northern coast of France.  It also gives us three father/son stories, one of them riveting, and for good measure, another strong uncle/nephew.  Also, there's the story of the Charles Dance character, a Fifth Columnist, contesting with Foyle for Sgt. Milner's loyalty.

""A Lesson In Murder,"" third episode, is also strong.  It deals with the well-known defensive evacuation of London's children to the countryside, and gives us a stunning look at the Government's secret program to prepare the many caskets it knew it would need for the expected German bombing of London.  Cheryl Campbell and Oliver Ford Davies headline the large cast: it gives us one more father/daughter conflict, and three more father/son stories.

""Eagle Day,"" fourth episode, deals with the great then-secret story of England's radar nets, necessary to protect against German air attack.  However, the plot's the weakest of the series.  Two further father/daughter stories give it what power it's got.

Anthony Horowitz, creator and writer of this series was born in 1955, began writing at eight, and sold his first script at twenty.  He has written for ""Midsomer Murders,"" and ""Murder in Mind,"" among other British tv series.  He's from a background with substantial similarities to that of John Le Carre, England's outstanding espionage author.  Both had trickster fathers, sometimes king of the hill, sometimes bottom of the barrel, with good times good enough to buy solid private educations.  Le Carre often uses father/son relations in his work, particularly confidence man father/son; it's interesting that Horowitz so often does, too.",1185235200,,5327,5.252656434474616
3627089,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I had not heard of this series until I was introduced to it by a friend. While there are only 4 episodes in each of the first 3 series, each episode is 1hour 40 minutes in length and so there is ample time to develope the plot without rushing to solve it in the last 10 minutes.  The acting, dialogue and costuming are excellent. The 1940's setting is so well captured that it is a joy to watch even without the storylines which themselves are superb.  I cannot fault this series and a bonus for me has been the educational element.  Being born in London I absorbed from my family some of what life must have been like during WW2, but I have learnt so much more of the day to day elements of life from these programmes.  For instance, who knew that the British Government passed a law banning people from giving milk to their pet dogs? Or that there was a National day of prayer to hold back a German invasion?

I would recommend all of these episodes to anyone who enjoys a well scripted story with impeccable settings.",1180483200,,1020,4.319371727748691
3627090,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I am no huge fan of murder mysteries, but this British-made TV series absolutely won me over. At first, the mix of historical drama and the long-established conventions of the genre seemed a bit forced, but Michael Kitchen's Inspector Foyle made me stop caring about all that. His fundamental decency, his calmly ironic reserve, and the hints of well-guarded sorrows made his character irresistible. I nearly grieved after watching the last episode currently available on DVD (series 3).

Credit also goes to writer Anthony Horowitz, who has based these stories on thoroughly grounded research. Set in the first years of WWII, they focus on the less-than-admirable underside of wartime social behavior, including the black market, profiteers, closet fascists, deserters, looters, traitors, and so on. Meanwhile, the British hold out alone against the German onslaught. Nightly bombing raids destroy lives and property along England's south coast where the stories take place, young pilots take to the skies in their Spitfires, and UXB teams defuse unexploded bombs. Often, as historical drama, the solving of a mystery becomes almost secondary to the rest of the episode.

Not least is the quality of the direction and the performances by Honeysuckle Weeks, as the Inspector's driver, and Anthony Howell as his assistant, Sgt. Milner. Set among the unsavory sorts that tend to surface in crime fiction, they are admirable in their consistent determination to do the right thing in all circumstances. There are also guest performances by the likes of Corin Redgrave, Edward Fox, and James Wilby. The DVDs include interviews with the writer and making-of featurettes that provide a revealing look behind the scenes.",1179014400,,1713,5.340740740740741

My only regret is that I can't recommend it to my parents, who would love it but are both hard of hearing and have trouble understanding British accents.

If anybody in the industry reads these things, please pass the word that subtitles would help this deserving show reach a wider audience.",1170374400,,713,5.076923076923077
3627107,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Michael Kitchen.  Never heard of him, I'm sure, you're saying.  That would be your loss, especially if you enjoy a great period piece now and then.  Kitchen was marvelous as the British agent for a British landlord with holdings in 19th century Ireland, in ""The Hanging Gale."" And now Kitchen triumphs again as a detective chief superintendent Christopher Foyle.  He often identifies himself, however, rather more charmingly:  ""My name is Foyle.  I'm a police officer.""  No badge is shown or papers presented while so introducing himself.  Such would be superfluous though as Kitchen's Foyle, in mannerisms, demeanor, as well as the way his carries himself, makes it rather apparent that he is in law enforcement.  And to boot, all this takes place in the early days of 1940, ""in the beautiful southern English countryside amid the disorder and danger of World War II""(to quote the packaging).  The best episode of the three here, the 2nd in the series, like all the others ""concentrate on the influence the war had on the home front.""  The ""White Feather"" is a symbol of cowardice from the First World War and herein stands in as the name of a hotel where Nazi sympathizers gather to espouse anti-Semitism and collectively wish for a German invasion.

As in all Foyle episodes a murder takes place and Kitchen methodically goes about solving it.  He has a sergeant for assistance as well as an actress side-kick (whose most unusual name in real life is Honeysuckle Weeks) who plays an army soldier seconded to drive for Foyle, who is without a license to do so.  Like in many detective dramas the who did it is rather less important than the drama getting to that point.  Actually, these hour and forty minute long Foyle episodes often go by for me without my giving much serious contemplation toward the solution Foyle seeks.  Ever play chess and really focus on 3, 4, 5, 6 possible moves in advance and then play a casual game of chess just for fun?  That's how I personally watch Foyle's War.  I'm not too interested in guessing then second guessing again & again who I think is the murderer.  (I do do that often with David Suchet's Hercule Poirot Agatha Christie mystery dramas, but alas,  do too much guessing wrong there, however.)  Watching Foyle is also much a period drama, as I've said, giving one a feel for 1939-1940 England, the country lanes, the occasional military vehicle and soldier(s), authentic clothes, hats, people on missions greater than themselves passing through the lens.

""A lesson in murder"" is what a character terms war in the 3rd episode of this series.  The episode balances the views of conscientious objectors with the need to contribute to a cause thought noble and just by most.  An interesting angle of the Foyle series is the notion that the rule of law remains central even in a time of great moral stress; not in the sense of civil liberties ala Lincoln in the US Civil War, but  in the sense that a murder is a murder whether a country is at war or not and such a crime out  result in punishment.  In this first episode, for example,  a military man tries to reason with Foyle that taking him away from the invaluable work he was doing, leading a team trying to combat Nazi Germany, would serve no end, certainly no greater good.  Foyle's driver later asks him whether he was tempted to let the man go, so to speak; give him a pass because of the circumstances Britain found itself in at the moment.  Yes, Foyle, answered, in so many words.  Nevertheless, we see the man in question being soon dealt with showing that Foyle's sympathies, war reason, didn't get the best of him in the end.  Such evinces the quality of this series---sympathies for varied viewpoints are shown, but in the end much of which most could seen as right, is followed through on....thanks to the able Michael Kitchen.  Kitchen, moreover, is an actor who is most accomplished even when not saying anything.  Words are not thrown about in this series.  In one episode (I won't say which as it will give away a bit of one story) Honeysuckle Weeks character Sam admits to Foyle that she doesn't know what to say after an unfortunate tragedy.  To which Foyle responds: ""I don't know what to say either.""  It's the epitome of Michael Kitchen's performance in this series---knowing what to say when words are warranted and saying little or nothing when they are not.

Kitchen conveys volumes about his character's inner turmoil and thoughts--without speaking a single word.  By watching the delightful interplay between Foyle and Sam, between father and son, between employer and subordinate, friend and friend, you discover nuggets of each person's upbringings, beliefs, losses, and fears. The mostly-unseen character who influences them all, the soon-to-invade German army, continuously forces each character to internally re-examine his or her priorities and decisions.

This series is superb. Anyone interested in mysteries or in history will thoroughly enjoy.",1159315200,,823,5.666666666666667
3627122,3,B000MQCBSQ,"This series may or may not be as good as everyone says. I bought Seasons 1 and 2,and what little I could understand seemed good. The problem is no subtitles. If you are hard of hearing like me the lack of subtitles makes it hard to follow what is going on in some instances. For example,there is a woman in one episode whose voice is so high-pitched all I hear is white noise. I didn't understand a single word she said. When you add the English accents to this problem,it is even worse.

At this point I won't be buying the 3rd year because of this problem. It's hard to enjoy a video if you don't know what is being said. Cheesy ""direct to video"" movies are made with subtitles,so it isn't asking too much for a expensive series like this to have them,too.

An additional problem is none of the DVD's are marked as to sequence,and aren't even loaded in the boxes in sequence. This leads to confusion because in one episode the detective sgt is living alone and has a wooden leg,and in the next one is on crutches and his wife is living with him.

If you enjoy the high quality productions that ITV offers, and if you like brooding detectives solving various mysteries, usually homicides, and if you love anything set in England in the 1940s, then you couldn't ask for a better series than Foyle's War.

The sets are very accurate to the times, the scripts are very tight and although the episodes have that typically English leisurely pace about them, they do not languish.

Today, as during WWII, we are confronted with dilemmas about what compromises should -- or should not -- be made in the name of expediency during wartime.  The character of Detective Foyle displays great, yet understated, integrity during a period when it is easy to rationalize compromising long-held ethical principles in the name of supporting the immediate war effort.

3627127,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I find most of PBS' second hand mysteries dull vehicles and some have ruined so superb book characters. This is one of the few exceptions,  probably the best. There is some uneveness but nothing that would dull the enjoyment.

It goes against the grain. . The actress playing Sam with a highly improbable name. The over-the-top pilot son. A first rate police inspector working from backwater? The amputee war veteran detective.  C'mon, the last big thing that happened in Hastings came in 1066.

BUT Honeysuckle Weeks seems a real name and an insiduoussly good actress. appears to be her real name and the quality of her performance is insiduously good and her looks grow on you as well. The rest of the cast grows on you and then there's Michael Kitchen who grabs his role by the throat while eschewing the curtain.  This is in a sense one of the roles of his life because he defines the character and makes it look easy. Only the best do that. Then there's unspoiled beautiful Hastings which needs only a  bit of cosmetics to cover a bit of modernity.

Happily for those who love it, Hastings faded into the background after the War. Until now.

The visuals are excellent and the rare special effects work is very good and puts to shame the cheesy work done on supposed war documentaries. The bucolic setting allows more of a period feel without a excess of overdone museum cars and the rest.

The series moves ahead in time with the war, from the early disasters. It's not rose-tinted glass, all heroism.  The Nazi sympathizers were real and numerouss just as they were in the U.S.  At the outset, there is the portent of things to come.

So, did anything actually happen at Hastings? There the show takes a few minor liberties, one about the Dunkirk evacuation. But a Hastings author, Victoria Seymour, writes of  ""a parade of `spies', aliens, pacifists, looters, wartime racketeers and small-time criminals. Added to these were hundreds of usually law-abiding people, who found themselves in court for flouting often not properly understood laws.""

This is obviously not a documentary, but in many ways it does a better job of painting an era. While Britain struggles for existence, it must deal with their own version of our Isolationists and right wing Nazi sympathesizers -- and the usual array of scoundrels and fools. Foyle makes judgments as he must, sometimes to his own detriment. He is a man of integrity, not ideology.

There are now five seasons of four television movies each. Some are better than others, but I have not found one to be bad and while each stands on its own, all add to the whole. Despite not having been in Hastings in many years, the local site [...] is excellent, enjoys the link the show. There are also good Foyle sites among the obsessive.

The fourth episode shows the level of care in all. Andrew is flying low altitude missions to test the highly-secret British coastal radar which used ""curtain"" antennas of wires strung between the towers. Known as Chain Low, it had a range of about 100 miles but its low alttitude weakness left a hole for low flying raiders. The secondary Chain Home Low was in fact tested on site by RAF pilots.

The series takes place in a very simple setting (Hastings), yet it is a very complex and trying time for the British during the war and these two worlds collide and intertwine in a amazing and riveting way.  I have always been interested and fascinated by stories that came out of World War II.  Those who fought it, the machines they used and the sacrifices they made.  It was exactly that which enticed me to watch the very first episode on our local PBS channel and I've been hooked ever since then.  However, the series does not revolve around the war and therefore should not scare off anyone from watching it.  All those involved do a fantastic job of creating a true mystery.  Not a war flick.

3627132,4,B000MQCBSQ,"I saw some reviews for Foyle's War about 2 months ago. It is a 4-disk set, each containing a story around 90-100 minutes in length. It is terribly interesting about the different perspective that the whole series has on WWII. It's like a smaller story, playing out within the larger context of the whole war.

It does present some fairly interesting plots, but that's not the strengths I would recommend these.

You will most definitely learning something new each show. Guaranteed. And it will stuff that you would never hear or know about in the States. Whether it was the idea that all/most German citizens in England were rounded up and put into camps (similar to what the US did with Japanese citizens), the anger and riots towards Italian citizens after Italy declared itself as an ally of Germany, or even how hundreds and thousands of coffins were pre-made in the months before London was bombed day-in and day-out.

It's like a combination of a History Book and a Law and Order episode.

Would I recommend it? Yes. I mean, you are only spending 20-30 bucks on a 4-DVD set, so you may as well get something that is interesting. I must warn you, however, the Brits have a very different way of doing their crime shows. We like it loud, hard, and fast...the Brits style seems to be more leisurely.

Would I recommend buying seasons 2/3? Yes. I ordered them already. I like to learn, see new things, and understand different perspectives. The fact that the cases of murders themselves are kinda confusing/fasciating only colors in the blanks.

I'd give Foyle's War a B. It's not brillant, not terrible, but Gosh at least somebody tried a different way of persenting a crime show. And they shouldn't get penalized for that.",1140912000,,1727,4.72093023255814

The clothes, cars, music and even the way people thought back then are authentic. A detective story during a war...brilliant.  The actors are superb.

3627140,4,B000MQCBSQ,"Well, here's an idea that works remarkably well - set a more or less traditional mystery series in Britain during World War II, layer it with plenty of at-war ambient and wait, you won't have to wait long, for the corpses to start falling.

 I'm not a great fan of mystery series.  If I figure the mystery out too soon I feel cheated, if I don't figure it out I suspect they were cheating.  Various recommendation engines don't recognize such subtle objections, though, and they've been throwing FOYLES' WAR at me for months.  So I bit.  Glad they did. Although other crimes are investigated by DCS (Detective Chief Sergeant) Christopher Foyle (Michael Kitchen,) for the most part this series deals with murder most foul. Anyway, as writer and creator Anthony Horowitz explains in a couple of short interviews on the dvds, the context in which the crimes take place - war-time Britain - is as important as the crimes themselves.  I'm not an expert on it, but I found FOYLE'S WAR'S depiction of war-torn Britain accurate and often surprising.

  The series occurs in a chronological order and each episode is pegged to a war event.  For instance, the first episode, `The German Woman,' occurs shortly after the outbreak of the war, sometime soon after the fall of Norway.  The next three episodes occur during and deal with the Dunkirk evacuation, the entry of Italy into the war, and the Luftwaffe assault on Britain. Context may not be everything, but it counts for a lot here, and the threat of an imminent invasion - even though we know that never happened - adds a nice layer of tension to the proceedings.  As someone weaned on Winston Churchill's history of the war I found some of the other layers unusual and welcome.  Conscientious objectors, xenophobes, quislings and their ilk all figure prominently in these stories.  Although the mysteries were plausible, the clues sufficient, etc, etc, I have to admit I found the background stuff more fascinating than the central crimes.

  Michael Kitchen plays Foyle in quiet competence mode, and his understated approach wears well.  Honeysuckle Weeks plays Samatha Stewart, a service-woman who is employed as Foyle's driver.  Kitchen and Weeks have a good bit of (unromantic) chemistry going, and watching the two settle into their roles was enjoyable.  The third major player is Anthony Howell, who plays a wounded soldier who Foyle enlists to help him solve the seemingly endless number of baffling murders he's confronted with.  All three do good justice to Horowitz's above-average scripts.",1136160000,,2548,4.959905660377358
3627141,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I usually find murder mystery dramas a hit-or-miss affair but Foyle's War has renewed my faith in a genre that has largely been done to death in recent years.

Foyle's War is superbly written with great acting from all the main characters (as well as supporting cast and guest stars) - in particular, of course, Michael Kitchen as the rather sobering Christopher Foyle.

Foyle is a rather complex detective, with an inner turmoil of morality and upholding the law (though upholding the law is his final prerogative). For exmaple, there is an episode where a warden has been caught looting from a bombed house and a new emergency law means that the thieving warden will be hanged as a looter. The warden cannot believe, in his niavity, that his crime deserves punishment of such gravitus. Through Kitchen's subtle facial expressions, we can sense a conflict between the severity of the warden's inevitable punishment and the duty to uphold the law, especially in the cruel time of war. To me, that makes great acting - not what the character says, or how it is said, but what the character says in silence.

War fever England is recreated realistically with actual historical facts incorporated into the fictional story (such as internment camps for German citizens).

Each episode is approx 100 minutes long (uncut versions) and are complex enough to have ample replay value.

If you like intelligent, well written dramas with great acting I highly recommend Foyle's War.",1133222400,,1471,4.963414634146342
3627142,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I have indicated on this Board many times that I am a very intense fan of the English Murder/Mystery. ""Foyle's War"" is one of the very BEST that I have ever seen!  I've come rather late, for some unknown reason, to this series.  My loss! In the previous reviews to this series the writers have done a superb job of describing the ""goings ons"" in this presentation.  I won't regurgitate their synopsis.  However, I must say that I totally agree with their praise of this drama.  It is truly wonderful!  I plan on purchasing the other DVDs in the series.  I like it that much.  The acting, direction, scrip, etc. are sublime.  I feel that Michael Kitchen is great as inspector Christopher Foyle.  Likewise, Honeysuckle Weeks as Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart (Foyle's driver) and Anthony Howell as Paul Milner, Foyle's assistant are superb in their roles.  The relationship between the characters is portrayed very realistically.
I don't feel that there is one ""false step"" taken in this series.  Everything is presented realistically and, to me, in a most truthful manner truly reflecting the era.  There, to me, is no ""updating"" in the presentation to make it more commercially appealing for today's audience,  A prime example is the relationship between Foyle's son and himself.  Although, we the viewing audience get the feeling that they truly love each other a great deal, there is no overt displays of this affection.  Anyone having a male relative coming from the 1940's (or immediately before or after) realizes that it just was NOT the thing, in most cases, for male relatives to do that is to display any kind of affection towards each other no matter the true feelings envolved.  It simply wasn't too socially acceptable!  (At least, in my own personal experience)  Anyway, one really gets the feeling that Foyle loves his son; however, it is expressed in a most subtle manner.

3627143,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Series 3 of the excellent series Foyle's war was first telecast in the U.S. on PBS on 11, 18, 25 Sep. and 3 Oct. 2005 and was released on DVD on 1 Nov. 2005. However, watching the DVDs of all series is preferable if one wants to see the unexpurgated episodes. Here are the first telecast dates for series 1-4 of Foyle's war:
series 1: telecast UK Oct.-Nov. 2002, US in Feb. 2003 (on Masterpiece theater, with Russell Baker introducing)
series 2: telecast UK Nov.-Dec. 2003, US in July-Aug. 2004 (on Mystery)
series 3: telecast UK Oct.-Nov. 2004, US in Sep.-Oct. 2005 (on Mystery)
series 4: was filmed in spring 2005 and will be telecast in 2006
The PBS broadcasts in the US are edited for a 90-minute period, which includes the Mystery (or Masterpiece theater) opening-closing sequences, between-program promos, etc. This means that each episode is really only 85 minutes long at best. Region 1 DVDs (U.S., Canada), in contrast, are about 100 minutes per episode, as are the region 2 DVDs (Europe--see www.amazon.co.uk): specific values for the 4 episodes on series 2 are (for region 1) 98.5, 97.9, 98.3, 98.3 minutes. Thus in the U.S. for the proper, more nuanced episode watching Foyle's war on DVD is essential and preferable to viewing it on PBS.

Note: In a 28 Sep. 2004 interview with creator-writer Anthony Horowitz, he was asked: ""Do you realise that the show is edited to pieces when it's shown on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) in the states?"" Horowitz replied: ""Yes we're very sorry about that. It's not something I'd choose to do. It's American networking. I'd advise all American fans to get their hands on the English DVDs to see them in full."" I note here that American fans need only get the *American* DVDs to see the episodes in full.

The ensemble cast works well together, with each actor playing off the other and each character having their unfolding quirks and nuances that fit well together.  The stories themselves are quality English mysteries, in that they are well written and not obvious.

A word about the setting.  This is Great Britain during the so-called ""phony war"" in the spring of 1940, just before the Blitz began.  There is a tension that surrounds everything-the war is brewing, and everyone is gearing up for the fight, but no one really has any idea what ""Mr. Hitler"" is up to.  Certainly the dramatic irony from the viewers' perspective allows us to catch that this is the lull before the great storm.

I've been pleasantly suprised with exactly how much I actually like all four episodes in fact, since mysteries tend to not be my favorite genre. All four stories are engaging on a number of levels, the acting is first rate, and I like how each episode touches on some of the darker implications that being at war can have on the social or national or community psyche of a people. The series is very timely in that respect in our present day circumstances. Michael Kitchen shows his mucho acting chops as the very contained -yet-hiding -underneath -is-some-major passion/anger- Christopher Foyle.  Anthony Howell's wounded-in-more-ways-than-one ex-solidier Paul Milner is at turns  brillliant and vulnerable(oy, watch out for that wife of his!), and Honeysuckle Weeks is very endearing as the plucky and young hearted Sam.

Each episode contains a mystery that is solved by the end, but I cared less about the ""who dunnit"" aspect that by the entire story surrounding the mystery. We see what it was like to live in Britain at the start of the war; what it was like to sail off to Dunkirk to help bring the boys back; what people went through to buy food and petrol.

3627150,4,B000MQCBSQ,"Perhaps it's my affection for England - a love that makes my wife roll her eyes - that causes me to have a higher regard for BBC and ITV small screen productions than those of America, which seem so crass in comparison. So many of the former seem uncommonly funny, intelligent, or both. FOYLE'S WAR is an uncommonly intelligent detective drama, a period piece set on England's south coast in 1940. And, to keep the record straight, my wife's dedication to this series is at least as pronounced as mine, if not more so.

 Michael Kitchen is Detective Inspector Christopher Foyle, who's ordered to remain at his post as homicide investigator for Hastings and its environs; he'd much rather be doing his bit for King and Empire fighting the Nazis across the Channel. Indeed, his son is a flying officer with the RAF. The two other series regulars are Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks), the Women's Royal Army Corps enlistee assigned as his driver, and Paul Milner (Anthony Howell), Foyle's assistant inspector recently returned to home front duty after being wounded with the Army during the disastrous British invasion of Norway.

 In Series One,the murders occur in contexts that include sexual harassment, anti-semitism, police brutality, local jingoism, sabotage, and conscientious objection - all set against a backdrop of Luftwaffe bombing raids and the fear of imminent amphibious invasion by the German Wehrmacht.

 The character of Foyle - intelligent, perceptive, reserved, compassionate, wounded by his wife's recent death, worried for his son's safety - epitomizes the phrase ""still waters run deep."" The viewer embarks into each episode wondering what new layer of Foyle's persona will be revealed. (Not to give too much away, but I've just seen the first episode of Series Two, which gives evidence of an old and tragic love affair involving Foyle and a now-married gentlewoman.) And the evolution of the relationship between Foyle and the occasionally cheeky Sam is one of the major delights of the miniseries as the latter proves she's smart, intuitive, and potentially more useful than just a lowly chauffeur.

 The various murders investigated by the trio are never straightforward, but involve clever plot twists and hidden motives, the solutions to which silently gestate in the Inspector's mind before being revealed at the end of the story, much like the Sherlock Holmes mysteries of old.

 There are, of course, uneven moments to Series One which allow for only four stars. I trust, as the show matures, that it will only get better. The areas that need no improvement are the period costuming, props and sets, all of which are superbly done and a delight to an Anglophile.",1091318400,,2702,5.07900677200903

3627162,5,B000MQCBSQ,"A beautifully turned bit of television. The research that contributed to the production of this series of four episodes centers on touching human details. The vets of World War I are the mature characters in this set of period pieces, and their recollections of what they did and saw in that prior war provides an overlay of feeling that subtly yet tellingly colors their dread of the conflict that was coming in the later months of 1940. Michael Kitchen's portrayal of the recently widowed Chief Detective Inspector Foyle has an added layer of subdued sadness and world-weariness that is punctured first by the taut energy and keenness of his driver, Samantha (adorably portrayed by Honeysuckle Weeks), then by the sad grief and disorientation of a young policeman returning from the war in Norway who has lost a leg in combat, and finally by the exhuberant naivite of his son. His wry humor and frank approach to those he interrogates and whose guilt he confronts is so low-key it takes one's breath away and provides a vehicle for his gradual emergence from a grief that is barely mentioned, yet permeates Kitchen's beautifully modulated characterization.
The entire cast received careful direction to portray the coiled fear and concern of ordinary humans caught in a situation where an invasion can happen any time.
Echoes of the current unlawful detention of ""combatants"" crop up as a subplot in the first episode, where a pair of worthy German immigrants are abused by busy xenophobes driven by misguided patriotism and fear. Indeed, the plot of every one of these four episodes has deep relevance in our own time of conflict and political uncertainty. Interestingly complex and puzzling.

3627164,5,B000MQCBSQ,"This is a worthy new addition to the best British mystery series -- heavy praise from me.  As a red-eyed fan of Morse, Dalgliesh, Poirot, Holmes (Brett), Smiley, Wimsey, etc., I am picky, having hosed off Oscar(R) winners and sequel spawners with a couple of stars and a flood of sarcasm.  However, my only misgivings about the five-star award to this (thank heaven only the first) ""Foyle's War"" set is that Amazon.com would not allow me to give it all the stars it merits.
I especially like its Britain -- no London / manorial ambience:  Hitler lurks 30 miles across the Channel washing at our feet, the Battle of Britain has yet to be won, the Yanks not yet ""overpaid, oversexed, and over here.""  At any time, a storm of Nazi bombs, naval gunfire, and assault troops could smash into the deceptively tranquil seaside setting, making the visit from William the Conqueror 874 years earlier seem like a romp in the meadow.
Foyle is recently widowed, and must also solve cases not only amid the chaos of the Dunkirk rescue and attempts to set up coastal defenses, but also knowing that his son is one of the outnumbered pilots keeping the Nazi storm offshore, even falsely accused by a dishonest superior in one episode.  Foyle is human, doesn't drive(!) and is not delighted that his driver Sam turns out to be a Samantha -- until she conks a felon escaping him.  Kitchen and Weeks are perfect, with Weeks's heroic status multiplied by learning from the DVD extras that she DID OVER ONE HUNDRED TAKES of eating the same sandwich and still made it look like her first bite. Too bad we so seldom find actors as uniformly marvelous as in British productions.
I will expand no more on the excellent reviews by others who appreciated this series, except to agree most enthusiastically.  This is not only a superb mystery series, but an excellent reminder, in a setting not well-known in the US, of the courage and determination that the ordinary Brits found among their sometimes lovable quirks at a time when they stood alone as others caved in to Hitler.
The technological quality of the DVD's is superb.  These great British TV series are reason enough to stay with the 4:3 format and leave wide screens to those whose taste has sunk to (or never rose above) Hollywood.",1052352000,,2266,4.675879396984925
3627165,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I happened to catch the end of ""The White Feather"" on Masterpiece Theater recently, and eagerly came back for the following two episodes.  This extremely impressive series is set in 1940 England, and the atmosphere is immaculate to the last detail.
Michael Kitchen is simply suberb as Detective Chief Superintendant Christopher Foyle, who longs to do his part for the war but is ""too valuable"" to the police force - and so he is stuck at home, fighting his own personal war against crime.  And yet WWII plays a major role in each episode, and is a fantastic backdrop for this mystery/drama.
The plots are complex, some better than others, and the characters extremely well developed.  While Foyle is curiously quiet, he is a deeply engrossing character whose silent strength inspires great loyalty in those around him.  Though he often says little, the power of Michael Kitchen's sublime performance is in the expressiveness of his eyes - which speak much louder than words.
Ironically, the episode that drew me in (The White Feather) has ended up being my least favorite.  Although the mystery is well plotted and the characters very intriguing, the subject matter (fascism) is very ugly.  It was, however, a painful reality of life at the time.
The best mystery among the lot is episode three, A Lesson in Murder, and perhaps my favorite episode is the fourth, Eagle Day.  I love the relationship between Foyle and his son Andrew, which is portrayed with perfect restraint.  They love each other deeply, but maintain that distant, British politeness that we Americans often mistake for coldness.  This is superbly done, and Andrew (Julian Ovenden) is very charming.  Eagle Day sees this relationship at its ironic best.  Honeysuckle Weeks is spot-on perfect as Sam Stewart, and is the character the viewer (at least the female viewer) most easily identifies with - and therefore is crucially important.  Well done, to all!
I was very pleased with the widescreen presentation on the DVD, as well as the two-part interview with writer/creator Anthony Horowitz, which is well worth watching.  The only real disappointment is that the production notes are identical for all four DVDs, but this is a small complaint in light of the overall suberb quality of this series.

8308217,5,B000MQCBSQ,"I loved these three first seasons. The Cold War ones undo all the good these first years did, of finding our stride, meeting interesting people, and learning about how things were in England in WWII and afterwards. I didn't realize they were on rations for so much longer after the war was over. Which makes for graft, and situations which show how well these actors fill out their characters. A masterpiece.",1521676800,,408,4.76056338028169

8308219,5,B000MQCBSQ,"Just found this series on Netflix and was captivated from the start. My only complaint, actually two complaints: each episode could have been at least two hours and I would have loved it, and if only there had been more seasons. Seriously, the most satisfying program to come along in a very, very long time!",1520208000,,308,4.618181818181818
