3423791,5,B00197POXG,"What a wonderful show!  I was not able to follow this show during it's regularly scheduled timeslot.  This complete series megaset has allowed me to enjoy all the shows. (Haven't finished watching them all yet). The value is great!  The presentation value is great.  I will enjoy these for as long as DVDs last.  My only concern is ... how difficult it is for me to get the DVDs out of the pockets.  Younger fingers won't have a problem.  That's why I'd like to give it 4 3/4 stars, but the system only allows whole stars.",1226620800,43,522,4.375

3423802,5,B00197POXG,"No series will ever be written or acted that is better than Dr. Quinn.  It is the most romantic thing ever put on the screen. FORGET about Romeo and Juliet--an ABSURD play!  Sully and Michaela have what I like to call a true spiritual intimacy.  It is hard to define, but you know when it's there.  Don't buy the DVDs--too many technical problems.  Read the reviews on this.  If you want to watch the whole series, stream it.  I am an Amazon Prime member and use my Roku player to stream it on Amazon.  I have experienced no technical problems and am watching the entire series for the second time.",1518912000,,598,4.372727272727273

3423807,3,B00197POXG,"While it is wonderful to have the entire set, the way the discs are packaged is not good for them. The paper sleeves are so tight that I worry about scratching them every time I take them out to watch- almost enough for me to consider getting some slim DVD cases and repackaging them myself! The quality of the DVD's is decent, but I am sad that there are no captions, and the bonus material is somewhat lacking as well.

Pros- The entire series, neatly packaged in period casing
Cons- Getting DVD's out of the sleeves, the bulky display case, and lack of features.",1517270400,,565,4.4326923076923075

I did have a couple of loose discs though they were not scratched at all and still play perfectly. Mine wasn't a mix matched set although season 2 and 5 were in clear cases versus the black cases on the others but that's not an issue for me at all.

3423822,4,B00197POXG,"I purchased this several years ago and am for the most part happy with it. I have been watching Dr. Quinn through streaming and occasionally on television  and haven't revisited the DVDs, but I do recall some later season DVDs appearing damaged with audio, video and things being out of SYNC, but its been years since I have watched The DVDs so may not be remembering things correctly. Since I have been watching the series again, I sort of view the Dr. Quinn character as being somewhat of a liberal traitor (I didn't see her this way when watching the show as a child.) There are several instances like for example where she has cronies of hers who don't enforce the laws when Sully (and even Dr. Quinn herself) decide to bend and/or break them placed into positions of power (she pretty much owned the office of sheriff and decided who would or wouldn't get it)There were other times when townspeople were in the right to take up arms against violent Indians and she chastises them and acts as though they are lunatics for wanting to defend themselves and protect their families.  But still overall a great series.",1503964800,,1117,4.636363636363637

3423825,2,B00197POXG,"I'm addicted. I've been binge watching this as part of my research for a new series we're writing, and it's almost like a drug. If you love westerns and frontier/ pioneer life, then this is the show for you!

Amendment: I have tho drop this review WAY down. Everything seemed fine until the third season. Disc eight - Dr. Mike's wedding - had absolutely NO SOUND! Seriously?! That's, like, the most important event in the freaking show. I am VERY disappointed with whoever manufactured these discs. I could've dealt with the fact that some of them sound louder than others, or even the occasional static look the picture would get. But no sound to watch Michaela and Sully marry? What a bunch of hog wash!",1502236800,4,705,4.64
3423826,5,B00197POXG,Many hours of tv entertainment; goes back in time to learn about the development of medicine back in the days and the struggles the native Indians went through while their lands were being taken away over time.  Nice cast and story line.,1501804800,,237,4.642857142857143

3423840,4,B00197POXG,"DVD's came loose as the holders were broken and they were all scratched on the first series.  I was very disappointed that they'd send them out this way as I just shook it and could hear that they were loose without even opening them all up.  Wanted this series for my collection and was looking so forward to getting it.  Came quickly and packaged nicely but it was damaged!!!!    Not sure if I'll be purchasing this item again, so I'll be returning it.
7 - 5 - 2017 Update - ordered another set and I should've just asked for a replacement instead of sending the first ones back as the price went up quite a bit.  This set was used but they appear to be in pretty good condition and I just opened them up but when I shook them when they first came today I could hear them being loose again.    Only this time the DVD' s were just off of the plastic holder and not scratched.  Though they were wrapped nicely and I got all the series plus the movies too, I wouldn't have known that they were even used but some minor marks on the box.  At least the sender put clear tape around the outside of the series connected to the box so they wouldn't fall out during shipping and it didn't tear the box while taking it off either.  Not going to bother to send these back as I wanted this for my collection for awhile now and couldn't afford to spend a lot more for them brand new or used.  Watched it years ago when they first were on!  Watching the movies now and so far so good!  It's even full screen for my older TV!  I got them for a great price too.  Thank you!

I expected the sound to be off from the picture... but it wasn't at all!!! And ALL of my disks were in order- nice and neat! This set comes with the movies too- so you don't have to buy them separate! I actually bought season 1 from Barnes and Noble- thinking I got a good deal (but it wasn't), and these disks (and covers) look and sound exactly the same as the ones from Barnes and Noble! I was very pleased with how quickly they arrived too! I reccommend getting them.",1494633600,,600,4.136752136752137

3423921,4,B00197POXG,"""me thinks, the lady, she doth protest too much"". Once you get past the anachronistic,  justification and defensiveness for the amazing feat of a woman actually being able to be a doctor, and transport yourself to the appropriate timeline you'll love this show.  This is such a great series, and if you can ignore the 90s political statements forced on you, you'll enjoy every other minute of this show.  I bought it for my wife, and she had forgotten how much she enjoyed these when they were on TV.  She's really loved 'em; so glad I surprised her with them.  God bless,  Dave (in Colorado)",1476748800,,592,4.59047619047619

The hinges to a few of them broke in shipping so that might upset some but that's just the way it is with cheap plastic nowadays.  Otherwise, the discs each click into a door flap which is nice the way they've done it.  Second, one a scale of one to five I give it a three for picture quality.  Very very grainy for most of the pilot on my new 55inch with a sony blue ray as a player.  If you're a picture quality fanatic this might not be for you.  I will find out if it was just the pilot or all of them tonite when I watch the second one.  Otherwise, the plot and show are excellent.  I'm so glad I bought it.  I remember being a big fan of this show when it came out and that still stands true all these years later.  It's good values tv.  I'm glad it was done back in the day before they felt like the needed to make violence so real with graphicness.  So enjoy this show as I'm doing and share it with the family.",1470441600,,1007,3.9014778325123154
3423946,4,B00197POXG,So great to revisit this series!  The only reason it didn't receive a 5 star rating is because there is a dearth of good special features.

After receiving the box I opened them all up, checked the discs, and put the first episode in.  At first the lips were out of sync and I wasn't sure I could stand to watch it so I hit stop for about 10-15 seconds then hit play again and Voila! instant fix.  So now any time it happens this is all I have to do to fix it.  I've watched all of the 1st season and have had to stop and restart it about 3 times.

3423957,5,B00197POXG,"I grew up with Westerns until I was sick of them but I also in past years watched Dr. Quinn and fell in love with the series. I did not know the DVD complete series came out and when I saw this I was ecstatic!  I believe this is one of the best programs ever to hit TV and though I've watched thru most of Season Three every single episode is quality in acting, script, scenery, just everything that makes a movie for it's like watching a mini hour long movie. The price is so reasonable I thought I'd read wrong but was thrilled that it was the price listed at 4l. 00 and change.  If you haven't seen Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman you're missing a fabulous show. The premise is that this well off woman (Dr. Quinn) lives in Boston very comfortably but decides to become a doctor like her father.
Once she becomes a doctor she soon decided to go out west - to Colorado - where she is met with disdain and a lot of nasty comments; no-one had heard of a lady doctor before so they were all too cautious and used the barber in the town to do medical procedures.

Soon the town warmed up to her and she became quite loved; in the interim a friend in the town passed and asked Dr. Quinn to take care of her three children. She soon meets Sully who I won't tell you about--you just have to watch this marvelous show and see where it leads. I can't imagine why anyone would give this show bad reviews - there is nothing but quality work and storyline.....and all of it is sensational!!!!",1466899200,3,1475,4.186619718309859

The set was mixed up with clear and black boxes and also the cover art on the back wasn't matching with the picture here on Amazon; it looked more like two different sets put together into one box.

3424008,4,B00197POXG,"Dr. QuinnI have to admit I love the series.  Of course Im a dreamer and love story fanatic, tears and all.  In real life Im not as subservient to the antics and theatrics as the biased movies I watch.  Movies after all are an attempt to leave the normal and escape to the never, never land of hopeful bliss.  Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman meets the goal of transporting you into a fairyland where utopia excels and common sense (considering the time and place of the series) escapes realism and takes you to a place of wagon wheels and telegraph with the views of the IPad crowd with a left coast diversional take on life in the late 1800s.  That said, the series is wonderful and the storyline of each episode engrossing as long as you don't take it as a real town in the old west.  The values advocated are all worthy of twenty first century values as doubtfully as that would seem.  Hopefully we as a peoples can adopt a few of Quinns values.
On the side of the characters and the people who play them they hold to the views the series born them with from the beginning of the show.  That is good.  The boy Brian shines like a bright light in a world of confusion.  Sorting out the good from the bad is easy, but it takes, of course, Dr. Quinn to expose the inadequacies of the small frontier town.  So if you love movies as what they were intended to be, Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman is one of the best.",1454112000,,1400,4.245283018867925

3424013,5,B00197POXG,"I love it! worth every penny! Jane Seymour and Joe Lando were absolutely beautiful together and the cast were talented and performed well .  I don't understand why CBS cancelled such a wonderful series, beautiful screen play, beautiful stories, good family value, filled with adventures, love, trust, friendship, loyalty, humanity, historical events and medical history... good education for all ages - One of the best costume drama series on TV!  I hope a TV channel will re-create the sequel series as it ended with ""a New Beginning"" and the whole cast will be back in their roles.  No actors can replace Joe Lando and Jane Seymour in their roles and their sizzling chemistry.  There will never be another Sully and Michaela on screen.  Rumour has it the executives once planned to kill Sully for Daniel (politic); luckily they didn't make that stupid decision. Sully is Sully, no replacement! What they should have done was having the show last for another 10 years with the same cast!",1453161600,,988,4.927710843373494

I purchased one, but it was defective: the sound did not track with the video.  After testing several DVD's and finding them the same, I returned the set for a replacement. It arrived promptly but has the same defect.  I would like a refund I could apply toward the more expensive set, but Amazon will not refund.  I understand how problematic a refund could be for an opened DVD because one could just watch it and return it.  I think I will try one more replacement.  If that is also defective, I'll seek some sort of different solution.

DON'T BUY THE LESS EXPENSIVE SET.  I am guessing all of these are defective, hence the reason for the lower price.",1452902400,11,754,4.328571428571428

3424067,5,B00197POXG,"This is one of my favorite TV series ever.  The love story is wonderful, the plots good as well. The only criticism I have of this is that what did get old was the ""beating of the drum"" of how awfully we treated the American Indians.  It is true, but there were also egregious actions on both sides - so enough already!  Still, one of the best series ever.",1443312000,,356,4.130434782608695

3424091,4,B00197POXG,"This show was a favorite of mine growing up, and what really holds up is the quality of the character ensemble. There has been criticism that the show is moralistic (and it is), but it's strength is in its portrayal of an entire town of well-fleshed out characters: the former-gambler turned reverend, the embittered old store keeper, the bigoted barber, the saloon keeper in love with one of his ""girls"", one of whom is waiting to get out of her contract so she can marry the town's quiet, gentle telegraph officer. And so on and so on. It has it's ups and downs, but overall an entertaining series to watch for the first time or the first time in a long time.",1436313600,,661,4.426229508196721

In this series the viewpoints at least have something to do with the overall story.",1436054400,,386,4.632352941176471

3424122,5,B00197POXG,"I was concerned when purchasing the item from Expedited Warehouse since so may of the reviews seemed to indicate that my product would come damaged, missing DVDs, or anything except what the product description and images indicated that I should receive.  I want to make it very clear that as of 4/6/15- I received the product exactly as it was protrayed and described. Everything was in order- artwork is identical, all cds are in hardcases with pop-in cd holders not paper sleeves or flimsy cardboard, and all cases are contained in a sturdy box-set holder as pictured.
PLEASE when you review this product or try to order a complete set of Dr. Quinn, the Medicine Woman, make sure you are not looking at the 2nd option also available for sale on Amazon that very clearly pictures a flimsy, paper folder with paper sleeves and a ribbon holding it all together.

Expedited Warehouse delivered the product as promised in the Amazon description, I can't vouch for any other seller of the item.",1428278400,18,991,4.7894736842105265

I did not understand why this was not in there I thought for sure this would be in there as one of the chapters or series but I never saw a wedding of Sully and Dr Quinn. If someone out there has bought this set or just the wedding please let me know. Other than that it was very entertaning amazing and pretty true to its time.",1427068800,,558,4.081818181818182

Wish there were more series like this on present time TV.  The only thing I didn't like about this series was how it is packaged.  The case to hold the series is very deceiving, it's just the picture as shown, the rest is thin cardboard and plastic wrap.  We had to make a holder out of the box it came in.

3424164,2,B00197POXG,"If you purchase this set, make sure to immediately check all of the discs to ensure that you haven't received any duplicates.  Unfortunately, I did not do so (that never even occurred to me at the time, to be honest)....and I'm well past my return window now.  In my set, Season 3 has two Volume 1 discs and leaves out Volume 2.

So, in short, I do not have the complete series and will need to purchase Season 3 by itself in order to get the disc I need to complete my set (which isn't expensive to do....it's just the point of it).  If it wasn't for this error, I would have easily rated this box set as 5 stars.  So just be sure to check your discs for any duplicates upon receipt and you should be fine.

UPDATE:  I've downgraded my 3-star rating to 2-stars due to the fact that I've since found several discs to have intermittent audio issues.  Specifically, there are brief ""static-type"" sounds on some of the discs (Seasons 4-6) which only last for a second or two....but they occur multiple times per disc and are rather annoying.  I would give the actual show 10 stars if I could, but unfortunately, my particular box set leaves something to be desired.  The bad thing is that there's no practical way to watch this entire set within Amazon's return window to see if your set has problems.  This isn't Amazon's fault, of course....just something to consider.",1423267200,8,1367,4.471774193548387

Not a huge deal, but most episodic dvds I've seen give you the option to ""play all,"" and that would be nice for those times when you just want chill in front of the tv (like on a sick day).

I was able to watch it on my laptop by using explorer and clicking on the VOB files to open. Now tonight we watched Volume 5 of season 3. It would freeze a few times in the beginning and sound warbled a few times but the killer was it locked up in the last two minutes. No player or my laptop would play the last two minutes. There appears to be a dull spot on the surface near the end. We will keep our fingers crossed that the rest of the set will play. All the other disks played great, up to season 3. It is such a disappointment to watch a double length episode only to have it freeze right at the end.

3424316,5,B00197POXG,"There were a few glitches where the frames would freeze up on one of the programs and scenes were not complete.  Otherwise, it was well done and very satisfying to watch an old favorite of mine.

It's a shame that CBS does not let someone have the rights to this wonderful program.  We need more like this on television for our children to watch in a family setting.  Provides true values and excellent judgment in how to live life and relate to others.  With the development of family in such tragic arrears these days, it's good to have to share with children and teach them family values, character, and integrity.

It doesn't hurt for this ""Boomer"" to see a real love story develop and survive, also.  It would be great that they could do a pick up of the series through feature movies as they did in the two tv movies from 1999 and 2001, if nothing else.  Just a hint at some possible storylines - do Michaela and Sully have another baby; what about the new hospital and their commitment to the Indian cause; and does Colleen and her husband have children; what becomes of their hospital for the underprivileged; does Matthew ever marry and have a family of his own; does he become a lawyer; and what about Brian and his future life; don't forget Dorothy and Cloud Dancing and Jake and his wife; what becomes of Loren; let's not forget Robert E and Grace and the baby they are finally expecting.

There are endless possibilities which could be addressed.  Don't forget the historical perspective, also - the national park system, land preservation; the plight of the Indians, the development of the west.  It would be a great way to see more of welcome family programming on tv, again.  TIRED OF  reality shows, ad nauseum!!!!!

Hope this will reach CBS' attention.  Thanks Jane Seymour and Joe Lando for being willing to continue should it be picked up again!!!!",1412121600,,1868,4.618181818181818

Back in the early 1990's I remember seeing several episodes now and then, but did not have the time to catch very many of them.  Now watching the series from the beginning, I am impressed at the abilities of the actors cast in the various roles and the attention to detail shown in the production itself.  The series is a real treasure and offers much whether one is interested in great cinematography, western themes, the accurate depiction of the treatment of Native Americans in the early history of our nation or for the values taught in every episode.

No matter where the viewers are in their life's journey, the excellent writing addresses so many critical aspects of the human condition which we all share.  The actors are amazing individually and collectively as they tell the stories.  I found each show enlightening and thought provoking.  I highly recommend it for people of all ages.",1402876800,,491,4.867469879518072

3424394,5,B00197POXG,"I never watched this when they were airing it on TV.  It was the free first series on Amazon prime that got me hooked.  The DVD set is well set up, although they really should have included closed captioning, :( but that is my only gripe.

I'm almost at the end of the 5th season and the show never misses a beat.  It is inspiring to watch Dr. Quinn and her family (Sully too) show excellent values and hope, and patience, and to see the other characters evolve as she spreads her patience and kindness.  It is like every lesson there are words of wisdom or some lesson that you can follow to make you a better person.  The actors are wonderful and this was well thought out.  I started taking notes of to remind myself to be more present and see the good in all people.  I'm not deeply religious but spiritual, Dr. Quinn is inspiring.  It is also a show that tries to stick with being true to the date, hardships and all.

I do recommend this for the whole family, even if a few others don't, maybe because the saloon has saloon girls.  It is done well and does not diminish the story. Everyone is treated with respect.

 If you want to feel good watch this!!  Some shows drain me, this leaves me uplifted.
I'm glad I bought the whole series. It is the type of show you can watch over and over and still get many things out of it.",1397692800,3,1331,4.188976377952756

It is refreshing to be able to view movies without obscene ""language""  and ""moral"" issues!  I highly recommend this series for families who enjoy reading/viewing  about early changing times - ""progress"" being made and new ideas being introduced, rejected, and accepted.  The story line for each movie is captivating.  I so wish this series could have been continued and not removed from T.V. viewing.

3424398,3,B00197POXG,My delivery was very timely and I am very happy to have the set.  I watched most of the episodes on TV with my children and got hooked on them again when Direct TV carried Inspiration channel.  Direct TV cancelled Inspiration channel and the episodes weren't in chronological order so it was hard to follow.  I was thrilled to find the set on Amazon and at a reasonable price!  I only gave 3 stars because the Season One plastic holder is really smashed up with several loose broken plastic pieces.  The discs don't stay hooked in and just rattle around in the holder. The main cardboard box has a smashed/crimpled area at the bottom where the Season One holder was so it apparently was not packaged correctly.  I am only on Season One and am hoping all of the discs are okay. I  really wish there were programs like this now for my grandchildren to watch but I will share the DVDs with them!!,1396742400,,893,4.408536585365853

3424401,5,B00197POXG,"Ok it is a little repetitive story line wise. I mean how many time can the same kids win every single thing in any town competition. And really could the town brothel owner be anymore of a sympathetic character at times? That's always disturbing when watching what is essentially a feminist show that the brothel owner becomes sympathetic. Talk about cognitive dissonance right there. But as a lady I watch for Sully. Just like I did when this was on TV years ago and my young heart and mind learned all about what love and relationships are supposed to be. Let me tell you... this set me up for epic failure in the romantic department later in life. Sully where are you?!

Anyhow, other than that awkward casting change with the daughter I still enjoyed watching the series again. Even the repetitive parts. It was a nice break from Sons of Anarchy which I had been watching before.",1396137600,,883,4.5886075949367084

3424403,5,B00197POXG,"Sit down, I have a long story for you. Christmas time was coming around and I absolutely HAD to get my mother the perfect gift. What better gift than Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman? I was named after one of the characters on the show since she was pregnant with me when the show came out so I thought it would make a great gift. Anyway, I ordered this gift set from Barnes and Noble. It was a little too expensive but I ordered it with the expedited shipping so I could have it for Christmas. Long story short, B&N only paid for the standard shipping so UPS informed me on the 23rd that my movie set wouldn't be at my house until the 27th. I was livid! So, I went to Amazon and ordered this at nearly 8PM on December 23rd, and they actually got it to me by 10AM on the 24th! I was so impressed by how quickly it got here. The package was exactly as described and everything was in perfect condition. My mom has spent hours watching this show and she absolutely loves it!",1395964800,,965,4.138297872340425

3424405,4,B00197POXG,These are nice but do have flaws. Sulley is not as good as an actor as Jane Seymour and the show seems to try to be politically correct by Sully never having a gun in the show. Several episodes are very nice but as I said it is not 100% accurate with the time period when most people back then had guns to defend themselves and I doubt you would find a woman Dr. back then!,1395705600,,373,3.9210526315789473
3424406,5,B00197POXG,"Very well made, historically correct, all around excellent series for the whole family! Jane Seymour and Joe Lando are excellent as Dr. Mike and Sully as is the entire cast.

3424407,5,B00197POXG,A fabulous tale of a woman doctor in the 18th century!  But this is not the only rule she breaks.  And a woman friend dies and leaves her children to Macalla to raise.  And then she falls in love with a man white but lives very close and true with Indians.  They do marry and have a child of their own. But each episode is a tale worth watching.  Often it will challenge typical thinking and make you think!  Very good story.,1395360000,,425,4.121951219512195
3424408,5,B00197POXG,I love this Dr Quinn set.  This series is one of my very favorites and now I can watch till my heat desires!  It arrived very quickly and in great shape!,1395273600,,153,3.903225806451613
3424409,2,B00197POXG,"Love this series. It's a family favorite. We could watch them over and over as a family. We were a little disappointed that the DVDs had no subtitle support, because we like having the words on the screen in case a small child starts fussing and we miss the dialog. Our television came up with nothing even when we put the CC feature on (which works with VHS tapes and some DVDs). I wonder why subtitles are missing? Not that we are hearing impaired, but how frustrating it must be for them to never know if their favorite movie or television show will have subtitles?

I am giving this a 2 star rating mainly because our set was missing a disc (well, really it had 2 of the same discs) and we now have to return it or accept Amazon's offer of a partial refund. I think we'll be returning it and trying again.",1395100800,,809,4.253246753246753

3424412,3,B00197POXG,"I love having the album-like megaset, I am a true fan and I like how it looks ""old west."" I plan on though, putting the discs in different cases to protect as they are just in paper, and the way you have to slide them in could scratch them. I can see how the box/album could be damaged if not handled well. You should know the album megaset does not include the 2 movies as the other plastic/cheaper set does. It would have been nice if they digitally remastered this series for the price you pay, because some episodes have poor sound quality. It's great to have the collection, I LOVE the show, there's nothing as great and family-oriented. It handles so many types of issues very well. Romance but also action packed.",1394064000,,720,4.421052631578948
3424413,4,B00197POXG,"When I say good, I mean both enjoyable and family friendly.  This series was a come-together event with my family every week.  It's well made, well acted, and well scripted.  They're all fairly accurate to the period.  Just have some fun!  What's even better, if you buy the entire series you get the two movies and some special features.  The only thing preventing a five star review is that they are NOT closed captioned.  This is a big drawback to people like my Grandmother of whom I purchased this for.  Her hearing isn't great, and I simply assumed the CC would be burned into the prints.  This is not the case.  If you're buying this for an elderly family member, be sure they're able to hear the dialogue.",1393977600,,713,4.5

3424426,5,B00197POXG,"ok so i thought long and hard about buying this set. i read tons of reviews, both good and bad. i would just like to say that the good reviews on this product were pretty much useless. seriously people, WE KNOW ITS A GREAT SHOW!!! otherwise we wouldn't be interested in buying it! talk about the quality of the product, not the actual show itself. none of the good reviews i read mentioned anything about the whether or not the discs played right, which made buying this product a very difficult decision. Ok, on to what's important. Most of the bad reviews i read said that the sound wasn't matching to picture and that the packaging was crappy. also alot people complained about the discs not working. well i got mine, and since i was watching them on netflix i was a few discs into it before i got my set. i can safely say that the audio is fine and matches the picture exactly. to those who's aren't, my dad told me there is feature on tvs that needs to be turned off to resolve this issue. i don't know it off the top of my head. also, the case wasn't the most sturdy, but mine arrived completely intact, and since i have the complete series of sex and the city in similar casing, i am used to this kind of packaging. It wasn't falling apart and seems to hold the discs a little too well! like i said, i've been watching it on netflix so i got my set when i was at about disc 5. i've watched three discs now since getting it, and they all seem to work fine. having said that, i haven't found anything to complain about. i love this product and would recommend it to anyone who wants to buy it. it is a great show and i very glad to finally have it and not have to spend an arm and a leg!! anything else anyone wants to know, feel free to ask!",1391299200,,1747,4.126099706744868

They don't make shows like this anymore unfortunately.  Really hoping that CBS will create a 3rd movie for the 20th anniversary with all the original cast.  This series never should have been cancelled when it was.  It was a shock to millions of devoted and loyal fans.

3424494,5,B00197POXG,"There's nothing to compare with this series. Entertainment with a heart and soul, including political, historical, ethical and moral messages masterfully written into the script and complete with outstanding visual accuracy and thoroughly convincing character portrayals. Its moral messages are the same relevant ones we wrestle with, and always with the reminder for the viewers to turn away from hate and violence, to consider other viewpoints, and to make humane and moral life decisions.
Families with children of all ages will enjoy the story lines and the action, and parents will be able to relate to the love and warmth of the plots as well. With six seasons to view there will always be these gems to turn to.
I am so glad I have this series to turn to at the times there is no quality programming scheduled.",1373500800,2,817,4.884892086330935

3424498,5,B00197POXG,"I watched this series regularly when it was, originally, on the air. The storylines were thought provoking, both from a historical and modern day perspective. Enjoyed the interplay among all the characters.....the fact that loyalty overrode, at times, differences of opinion and lifestyle (ie Hank vs. most everyone!). Originally, I never recognized the Sully/ Michaela relationship as central to the series....now I find it very sweet, in light of today's ""romantic"" portrayals......Watching this series again will be my ""video comfort food""!!",1372636800,,544,5.728395061728395

I have talked with her several times recently and she has told me how much she is really enjoying each episode in the series. She remarked that the episodes build on each other; the characters are all interesting: and each story has its own charm.

3424519,5,B00197POXG,I love this series and i am thrilled to have it all in one set. The first set of CD's in the set are very frustrating. It jumps and skips a lot and the sounds do not match the video. The rest of the series seems to be okay though. I am about half way through. The only other issue is that some of the episodes are out of order.,1363996800,,327,3.6857142857142855

3424523,3,B00197POXG,The discs are still messed up but we can watch them on a computer or ps3.

Joe Lando is sooo hot and I think he was my first manly man crush. Haha!  Jane Seymour, of course, is timeless.  Dr Quinn served as an inspiration to me.  As a young girl, I looked up to her independence and courage.  Some of the things that stuck: Stand up for what you believe in.  And true love + a successful career do exist. ;)

Now that said there are some things which I find super annoying. There are some places where the audio was out of sync with the video. Also the aspect ratio doesn't fit well on a modern widescreen tv, so (depending on your tv) you may have bars on the sides of the picture or zoomed in and loose some of the top and bottom or stretch it to fit. This is understandable though as it was made for broadcast years ago but still super annoying.",1361577600,,598,4.155172413793103

The price is great for the entire series.  However, I only gave it 4/5 stars because some of the discs did freeze at times.

I use to watch it when it was on and really liked it but now I love it even more.  It is a family show with no curse words and teaches family christian values.  All the characters are just wonderful.  My two favorites are Michaela and Sully.  It is a joy to sit back and watch their romance slowly develop. That a big difference from how the so called modern day romances on TV are portrayed today.  Dr. Quinn and Sully's is so much more romantic and exciting.  I would recommend this series to anyone who loves westerns,1358640000,,652,4.278688524590164

There is adventure suspense, romance, and caters to all ages as you watch this family come together through all sorts of trials and fun times.

Now that we have purchased the series we have watched it through and find it a great family film and wholesome entertainment.  Thanks to the Inspiration Channel for getting us interested in this great series.  We love all the actors and how the lives of the community interacted so well.  We are especially appreciative of how the film explains the plight of the Native Americans.,1357257600,,467,4.728395061728395

3424567,4,B00197POXG,"This was and is a favorite of mine.  I have watched the complete series once since buying it, and am now watching it again. The writing and acting are superb, and it is unfortunate that this wonderful show was cancelled because the demographic was women over 40.  Dumb move.  Quality is quality, and I'd rather watch a carefully and lovingly produced series like this instead of the ""reality programming"" that is so pervasive these days.

The first movie is not up to the quality of the series.  The second movie, however, is very well done, despite the absence of Chad Allen.  I have read that the entire cast is willing to do another movie, 12 years after the second.

Now the problem.  I suffer from a hearing loss, and there is no closed-captioning available on this set, or any other ""Dr. Quinn"" home video package.

That said, I'm glad I bought this set, and will continue to treasure and enjoy it.

Edited 3/8/2016.  I was told by a friend that Amazon was now offering a set with subtitles.  An Amazon rep assured me that was the case and so I ordered it.  It arrived today.  No subtitles.  Back it goes.  Very disappointed.  Bad business, Amazon.",1357171200,,1154,4.5512195121951216

It often happens that returning to the shows that we loved in childhood will taint those happy memories because they are very seldom as good as we thought they were when we were young.  I am so happy that I decided to give it a shot.  Even now, 20 years later, this show is just as entertaining and inspiring as it was all those years ago and, I think, I enjoy it more now because I can actually follow the storylines and character arcs.

3424597,3,B00197POXG,"I just love these dvds because the quality of mine are very good, they don't have any scratches, and they play very nicely on any dvd player. I watched this show from beginning to end back in the 1990's and I think Jane Seymour was well cast, as was Joe Lando (Sully), the kids, the towns folk....everyone!! Oh, yes we can't forget Cloud Dancing (Larry Sellers).  My only complaint is that there is absolutely NO EPISODE GUIDE anywhere with this set.....it's not even writtten on the insides of these seasons!

An episode guide for a set like this is necessary to find the episodes you are looking for, because they usually contain television log lines that tell you about each episode. So I am taking two stars off for that.....shame on you A&E channel!

A&E?  You tried to appease us by adding a list of Episodes in the cover of the First Season....that is not enough!!! You mearly, copied what is already written on the backs of each season in this set. That's another reason this product is getting only three stars.

I liked the price of this set, it used to be much higher, but this price resembles the product a lot more....a  good deal considerring there are six seasons plus two movies, and a few good extras.
Like the A&E Biography on Jane Seymour, interactive menues, and tidbits about the real Colorado Springs in the 1860's.

I wish there were interviews with Joe Lando and Jane Seymour....instead they have voice over commentaries on favorite episodes.....Joe  was absolutely gorgeous!! This series teaches youngsters high moral values in my opinion.  It doesn't have eveything I want in it, but I am still enjoying myself when I watch these. And I hope you do too.",1348185600,,1679,4.683673469387755

3424599,2,B00197POXG,"It is great to have all episodes of a beloved series, but there are some disappointments as well as technical glitches. The DVDs themselves are really no frills - you stick them in and choose your episode. The writing on the menus reminds me of the type of font that computers used to churn out in the late 1980s. Really basic. There are no extra features, no accompanying music to the menu - just stick in your DVD and choose your episode. For a collection of this price, I would have expected a little more.

Furthermore, as many of the other reviewers have said, I also had issues with the soundtrack being out of sync with the shows. Definitely a mismatch between when you heard someone speak, and when you see them speak. It is very irritating. HOWEVER, I discovered that if you pressed ""pause"", and then resumed, the voices would be in sync. It is completely bizarre but it worked. Every episode so far, has started off out of sync, and then when I pause and resume, everything is in the right timing. So for the others who have had this problem, please try this method. This is the ONLY reason I did not return the collection, since I am managing to watch all the episodes comfortably and in-sync.

Overall, a disappointing product. I gave it two stars because, well, I love this series. But they could have put this collection together with a little more thought and do things up a little more fancy.",1348012800,4,1408,4.49609375

That being said, if you haven't read the reviews about the qality of this box set on here, you probably should before you make a decision to buy this set.

I am on the second disc of season two in this set so far. Season one was great, but but when you watch season two, everything seems to be in slow motion some. People's mouths are in sync with the talking so far, but any of the faster action sequences are out of step. There really is no other box set that is available other than the faux leather bound notebook style boxset and that set has even more problems than this one. I have owned that set as well and the spiral notebook style of the set breaks very easily. Plus the dvd's are in carboard slip inserts, so they get scratched easy and some of the discs are already scratched when they come direct from the manufacturer.

I own a blue ray player and have been playing these disc on that with a HDMI flascreen TV and once I started having the probelms with season 2 and the out of sync stuff, I decided to pop the dvd into my dvd player that I still own. I know from past experience that some of my older dvd's that I own don't play well on the blu ray player, probably because of the up-converting that is automatically done by the blu ray player. I just tried playing an episode on my blu ray player and it was distorted so I tried playing it in my dvd player, and wouldn't you know it, it plays fine now!!!!!! For those of you who already own this series, try playing it on a dvd player if you haven't already, as that may solve your problem. I'd rather watch it on a dvd player and have a clear picture than a distorted one on a blu ray player.

For those of you who are confuser by this review, please read other reviews, expecially the negative ones about this set to find out what the issues are with this box set before you buy it. That being said, the jury is still out on if I would buy this set again or not. Under $100 is a good deal for a 6 season set, no matter what the set is and renting from the library is time consuming and you have to wait. I'll wait and see and cross my fingers that playing it on the dvd player solves the problem. For any future buyers, this set was done over in china(big surprise) and it is formatted horribly.

I will update my review and let everyone know after I have watched all of season 2 if playing it on a dvd player solves the problem.",1329436800,2,3150,4.148936170212766

This message could only come up on discs tht have been previously viewed which to me meant that Amazon had supplied me with 2nd hand goods when I had ordered for and paid for BRAND NEW UNOPENED GOODS.

In Amazon,s favour on both occassions the items were replaced promptly,but without an explanition from them on how these problem,s occured and it clear that they do not have a system in place to prevent these problems,or if they do have such a system someone is rorting this system.

3424637,3,B00197POXG,I loved Dr Quinn Medicine when it originally aired. I was very happy to see it re-aired. But the episodes sometimes jumped around for holiday airing. So I decided to purchase the complete set. Some of the episodes sound doesn't match the mouth movement. Which is very distracting. I am returned it and reodering.

Pros:
It's mostly family friendly. There is some violence, references to sexual activity (prostitution), and drinking. All of which, Dr. Quinn does not approve of.
It's a fun, light-hearted, and cheesy love show.
Cons:
Acting isn't that great, but it adds very well to the cheesiness.",1327363200,,363,5.066666666666666

Also mentioned was many of the DVD's skipped and were distorted.  I decided to take the risk because I really wanted the set.  I am very happy that I did.  The set contains 42 DVD's and I have watched most of them and so far they have all been perfect in every way. I give this set a 5 star rating and highly reccomend it to anyone who was ever a Dr. Quinn fan.  My only regret is that the show only ran for six seasons.  I wish it could have continued for many many more.,1327276800,,603,3.9833333333333334

3424641,5,B00197POXG,"Some of my first memories include sitting in the living room while my mother watched Dr. Quinn.  She even went so far as to obsessively record every episode on VHS.  Time has passed and the old VHS tapes don't work like they used to.  Needless to say when I saw the complete series -Movies included! -I had to purchase it for her.
Amazon offers a spectacular value for this timeless series -easily affordable for a even a college student.  The DVDs are painstakingly packaged with the utmost care.  Each case contains some variation in packaging style, although most of them overlap on the holders.  However, if handled responsibly, the packaging should remain intact and keep these DVDs safe.  All the DVDs arrived intact and accounted for.
The quality of the DVDs themselves is great.  The picture quality is clear and the DVDs are, so far, playing well.  The DVD menu interface is direct and easy to navigate for those who may not be tech savvy.

Dreadful. Soundtrack in too many segments is not synchronized with picture. Too distracting to watch at those times. The person who edited the series to this should be fired.

I have since read several reviews that are similar.  The first complete set we received did all of the above and every DVD package inside of a sealed cardboard case was not sealed and index was inside season one.  The replacement we got was sealed on the outside, and each season was also sealed with the index loose inside box.  We had gotten someone else's returned set.

3424663,4,B00197POXG,"I always admired Jane Seymour, so it leaves even me surprised that I never watched this series before. Caught an episode on cable TV a few months ago and was delighted with what I saw. However, coming into a *new* series without the background that this one requires would have made for a less enjoyable viewing. Therefore, when I saw what a low price Amazon had on this series with the movies included, I couldn't keep my finger off the *one click* button. I got my set in just a few days and have now watched the entire series (this is an update of my initial review).

One of the things I really like about this show is that it's *clean*. No reliance on smut, profanity or shock value to entice the so-called mature viewer. There is some silliness -- Dr. Quinn's wardrobe should take up her entire house, for instance, and some of the plot lines are rather weak. (The girl with the webbed hands, for instance or the masquerade ball with Seymour in a Cinderella-like costume  -- not likely, the plastic surgery Dr. Quinn is able to perform on the disfigured railroad engineer, etc). Balancing that are some excellent performances by the main cast and the recognition that this was never meant to be Masterpiece Theatre. Outstanding episodes to me were The Abduction and the one where Grace and Robert E.'s son faces a serious illness. I also really enjoyed the episode in which Mr. Brays *runs away*. There are more but these were especially good.

Anyone uneducated in the treatment of Native Americans during this time period will appreciate that for the most part, Dr. Quinn truly doesn't gloss over it. We are presented with attitudes that would shock us now but which were common at the time. The Washita episode is heartbreaking and Larry Sellers did an excellent job in conveying the reality behind the perception of Indian stoicism.

So it helps immensely that Dr. Quinn has a great cast (my favorites being the lovely Jane Seymour and the sometimes crotchety, always interesting Orson Bean in the role of Mr. Bray).

Indeed, there are many, many exciting and very touching moments. Larry Sellers does a wonderful job in conveying Cloud Dancing's innate dignity and Barbara Babcock is perfect as Dorothy. I preferred Erika Florez as Colleen but Jessica Bowman is very good. Chad Allen has some fine acting moments and Joe Lando was a very pleasant surprise.

The core of the series, of course, is the love story between Dr. Mike and Sully. They are *so* different. My favorite part of that storyline is the two-part episode which takes Michaela and the children to Boston with a (justifiably) jealous Sully discovering he has a worthy rival for her affections. So romantic, and so much fun to watch!

Anyways, Dr. Quinn is a pretty good series, one you won't be embarrassed to watch in front of your great aunt Bessie or your pre-teen children. The DVD packaging is perfect, in my opinion, and I like that the titles are easily visible on each DVD. I've ordered some series where you had to get out a magnifying glass to see which DVD you were looking at!

Very good show and one well worth the money. I'll watch it again in a few years.",1322092800,,3147,4.657657657657658

The two movies produced after Dr. Quinn ended are also in this collection so there is no need to purchase them separately.  Each episode has a written summary at the beginning so you can see what each episode is about.

My only complaint about the DVDs is that there is no ""play all"" selection (or if there is, I haven't found it). The root menu lists the episodes on each disk and you have to select play for each episode individually. It's kind of a pain, but not a deal breaker.

My real complaint is with the packaging. The idea of the ""book"" is clever but poorly constructed. Each disc fits into the cardboard sleeves of the pages. I'm concerned that there is not a soft lining to prevent scratching on the discs.

Overall I am pleased with my purchase...especially for the price! When I purchased them, they were on sale for less than $75 for the entire 6 seasons and 2 movies. I thought it was a wonderful deal!",1310515200,,958,4.401129943502825

3424696,5,B00197POXG,"""Dr. Quinn"" was on the air when I was in elementary school and I remember watching it occasionally with my family. When it came out on DVD, I was hoping to buy the seasons in stores but the prices were way too high. A few years later I started checking the DVD's out from the library, and decided I really wanted to own these. So I came to look at Amazon.

For 42 discs, the price was very reasonable. I was a little nervous to buy the product after reading the reviews about poor sound and picture quality, but I figured if the product wasn't good I could return it and get my money back.

It's been over four months since I bought it, and I watched the whole series and am currently watching it again. For overall quality, I give it a 99%. There wasn't anything wrong with the picture quality, and the sound quality was excellent except for on two discs in Season 6. There is one episode on each of those discs where a distinct popping sound can be heard. It isn't throughout both episodes, though, just on certain parts. It is kind of annoying but it doesn't prevent you from hearing the dialogue.

I still give the product five stars because other than what I just mentioned, this series is perfect! 42 discs with each season in its own case. All the cases are stored in one box with the Dr. Quinn movies (Yes, they are included! Don't order them separately!)

If you love this show, I highly recommend you check out this product.",1305763200,2,1434,4.33955223880597

It turned out better than expected.  She has absolutely loved watching all of these episodes again, and she and her mom have traded them back and forth for months now.  This set is so well put-together and has so many hours of material that it's an incredible deal.  I haven't heard a single complaint; great picture, sound, DVD menus, DVD cases and box.

3424703,4,B00197POXG,"Having never got a chance to watch this show when it initially aired, I have to say I found it to be really engaging, in addition to the beautiful scenery, the show is very family oriented & heartfelt, & like others have said, sadly shows like this are a thing of the past on network T.V., there is a lot of history with this show, Jane Seymour is one of the few women in Hollywood who has aged very well, no plastic surgery there, I always thought she was beautiful, & here she even more so, many historical events run parallel with this one, General Custard's war against the native indians, President Grant's attempted assassination, the women's movement, Quinn's struggle to be accepted as a woman doctor, the plagues that killed many in the 1800's, the advancing of Colorado Springs with it's first railroad, it's first bank run by Preston Lodge, the J.R. Ewing of this show, & many walks of life, with character's like Hank(the bartender/pimp), Jake(barber/mayor), Loren(store owner), characters I didn't like at first, but who grew on me, Larry Sellers was great as Cloud Dancing, Joe Lando as Sully, the show's heart & passion, Erika Flores as Colleen who I think outgrew the role of Colleen by being replaced by Jessica Bowman, even Chad Allen who later comes into his own as sherriff, many country music guest stars here as well (Johnny Cash, Travis Tritt, Willie Nelson) & John Schneider, it was nice to see him in a role other than Bo Duke(Dukes of Hazzard), this role fit him perfectly as Sully's best friend later sherriff in the 5th & 6th Seasons....whether historically accurate or not, this show gives us the early western life of this nation in a more simpler time & watching the characters you realize that we as a nation have become slaves to our own prosperity & yet you can see the seeds being planted of the challenges now facing our nation today, this show for me was a good history lesson on our never ending need to make money even at the expense of others, all & all a good show, money well spent.",1300406400,,2024,4.593922651933702

I purchased anyway, because it was a good price and I figured I could deal with that problem on a few episodes.  The packaging was fine, except that one of the bindings on the part that actually holds the DVD was broken at the spine and that has proven to be a bit of a pain.  Otherwise, it seems to be in good shape and is compact enough for just about any location in my room.

Upon loading the actual DVDs, I did find a few episodes where the sound and visual didn't match.  This was at first very annoying and I couldn't even watch it.  However, this was easily remedied by pushing the STOP button on the remote, waiting a few seconds, and pushing PLAY again.  The DVD was able to then match it and it worked fine from that point forward.  I gave this product four stars because of these two minor problems, but am nonetheless pleased with my purchase and look forward to enjoying every episode for a long time.

When I received my DVDs I started with the Pilot 2 hour episode and I am up to season 3 now. It is a wonderfully wholesome show that the entire family can watch and enjoy. It has action and adventure as well as a touch of romance. Each episode contains some sort of positive message and a happy ending, something that you don't see a lot of from television these days. And even though sometimes I would love to strangle some of the towns' people in the show, by the end of the program, with a little nudging from Dr. Mike, their compassionate sides do come to the forefront. I think that anyone who has never seen the show will love it from the very first episode and find it quite hard to turn off and anyone who has seen it before will truly enjoy watching from the first DVD to the last.",1284854400,,992,4.118556701030927

It wasn't until recently, I'd say the past year or so, that a co-worker, Mr. Paul Waldeier, really brought Dr. Quinn back into the forefront of my mind.  It was Paul's relentless attempts to prove to everyone on the sales team how valued the show's reign was to our society that really opened my eyes to the overall impact that this show has had on EACH AND EVERY ONE OF OUR LIVES...I mean, how can you forget Dr. Mike (Jane Seymour), ""Sully"" (the native american played by a caucasian), Matthew, Colleen and Brian (Dr. Quinn's three crazy kids)...

I've always loved the wonderful characters and cast and enjoy how the major storyline is interwoven in the minor storylines of each episode. I was, however, disappointed to find out that the DVDs freeze at times during episodes. Amazon was great about returning the first set and sent a replacement right away.

I ordered the complete season set and had them delivered to family and they mailed them to me overseas.  Needless to say, it was expensive and time-consuming to get them!  We started season 1 last night.  So far, after two episodes, the DVD sound is off.  It's like watching an old Kung-Fu movie.  The mouth moves and then the words are delayed seconds later.

But, over all it's a great and fairly clean series.  As for the quality of the DVDs and the cases, I would probably give them 5 stars as well.

Most are not extremely noticeable, yet some are quite loud.  With the number of mentions from persons experiencing the same problem, I would have to recommend Amazon communicate with the manufacture concerning this problem.  While I have not sent my set back, I am considering it.  Amazon and the company or manufacturer should recall and replace the sets having this problem.  I notice some of the reviewers have sent sets back for exchange only to receive a replacement with the same problem.  This is not an acceptable solution.

They have a lot of bar scenes and women for sale, if you know what I mean. The men wear long hair and there is a lot of physical contact between people who are not married.

It has great story lines and virtuous themes such as courage to stand up for what is right even if it puts your own safety or happiness on the line. Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman is a very clean show as well. I will have no reservations in letting my young children watch it as soon as they come along. This is a set you and your family will treasure.

I thought I had seen all the episodes when the series played on tv, but there were several that were new to me.  This show is amazing and I really enjoyed the historical accuracy in it.  I am a history buff and I savored every single minute of it.  Even the life messages that each episode contained are as true today as they were then.  I was surprised to learn that many of the predjudices of today were also around back in the late 1800's.  I guess some things never change.  My set came in a square box with Jane Seymour and Joe Lando on the front and back.  What I especially liked was the fact that I could read what each episode was about before I watched it.  The only disappointment for me was the fact that the Reverand Johnson remained blind to the end of the series.  I thought surely he would get his sight back.  I have purchased several tv series and this is the only one I watched completely from beginning to end.  I would recommend this series to anyone and everyone.  There is something for everyone from love scenes to frontier fights.",1265328000,,1124,4.320574162679426

I wish there were another 6 seasons so that I could continue watching. You get so close to the characters it's hard to see it come to an end. I've got a few years on me now and my memory ain't quite what it used to be. There was a time when I'd never watch a movie or TV show twice because I could remember it so well, even years later. I can see myself watching this series again, maybe a year or so down the road. If it remains at the current price, you can't go wrong.",1264204800,3,595,3.806451612903226

3424787,5,B00197POXG,"I had watched this show while on network tv, loved it, wanted my child to be introduced to a clean show with lots of history!!  I hadn't seen the 1st-3rd series, I was amazed at how much history was included & how the writer paid such close attention to period times and details. Of course, the relationship between Dr. Quinn & Sully is so pure & sweet, yet sexy & appealing without being vulgar; you find yourself cheering when they finally kiss! This show has something for all generations, children enjoy seeing how school, chores, discipline & daily life happened years ago. Dr. Quinn inspired my daughter by showing how women can do just about anything, with help and support of a good family and friends & emphasis on education. We loved this show and I would suggest it to anyone, especially if you have respect for history & lifestyles of the past!  The clothing & town setting, meadows & mountains & all the beautiful scenery, the Native Americans, African Americans, the immigrants, all make a beautiful show, I only wish this show could have continued, networks wanted trash on tv instead of good clean viewing for children. One sad reality this show reveals, is what happens to people when Greed & fortune come their way, it definitely shows how people change & what happens to a whole town & people in it, when progress comes along. We have progressed ourselves into a nation full of debt, greed & fortune seekers, we all need more God in our lives and this show has a great way of showing how important religion was  then & still is today. Thank you to Beth Sullivan for a Great Show, when are you going to make another one? Please include Joe Lando & Jane Seymour",1264032000,15,1678,4.568106312292358

This set is very compact with all 6 seasons AND the movies DVD.  Amazon gives you the tip that other customers have bought ""Dr Quinn: The Movies"" with this set but it's not necessary. I bought it together and opened both packages before realizing it was already included. Great quality show and packaging.  Only complaint is that for six seasons worth it didn't come with more special features, but that's very minor.  Can't beat this price!  Great!",1262649600,10,640,4.521739130434782

3424794,5,B00197POXG,"This is a great boxed set of the complete series of DQMW. I loved that each season is in its own box, and yet the discs are numbered consecutively (1-42) and clearly labeled... sometimes a ""complete series"" will use double-sided DVDs, to save space, but these are easy to read and handle. YES--the movies are also included (though not my favorite part, by any means... but that's another review).

The series itself is great family entertainment, and wonderfully romantic. For once, a series managed to show a ""realistic"" (TV Realistic, anyway) relationship, from attraction through courting through marriage, without losing the dramatic elements. Viewers start to feel like they know all the unique townspeople, from Hank the saloon owner to Dorothy the journalist to Horace, the sweet but bumbling telegraph operator, who are lovable at least as often as they are less than intelligent. If you've never seen the series, you should be forewarned that almost every episode is a Very Special Episiode--Dr. Mike (our heroine) goes head to head with issues as varied as corporal punishment, teaching evolution, and gun violence. The character of Colleen is played by a different actress starting midway through (ala Becky from Roseanne or Darren from Bewitched). And the sixth season bogs down in more depressing episodes and less Sully (our hero). Still, it's great to see the characters and the town grow. And it's *really* great to get the entire series for the price of two seasons worth!",1262131200,5,1489,5.077551020408163

This set is just a bit wider than the average individual season set of this show, and saves so much room!  As much as I love Dr. Quinn, I've been wishing they hadn't taken up so much space.  I feel like the packaging for this season is very secure, each season is held in its own plastic case, and each disc has its own plastic holder, so I'm not concerned about scratches.  This was my favorite show in the 1990s, and there really aren't any great quality family shows like this left any more.

Sully and Michaela were just an amazing romance that just isn't shown anymore. My dad loved Jane Seymore and she was a fantastic actress. Loved the stories with the children, the way our cities were developed, how lifestyles were back then, and all of the supporting cast was outstanding.

The packaging, however, could be better.  It is difficult to remove the discs from their pouches, and the first time I opened it, the leather strap came off completely (it was held in place by what looks like Scotch tape).  From the weight of the package, it is easy to see that the 'pages' containing the discs are likely going to come away from the spiral binding and I will likely have to buy separate cases for the discs.

The pockets to hold the DVDs are attached to the box with springs that became stretched out easily (the design is similar to that of school one-subject notebooks) and quickly, and tear the paper binding. The DVDs themselves aren't easy to remove from the sleeves, and have a tendency to skip. the packaging became ""ratty"" so quickly I ended up buying a more ""modern"" DVD holder. I've also had trouble moving from one episode to the next.

3424828,5,B00197POXG,"This review concerns the show itself, and not necessarily this edition. Unfortunately I had just finished purchasing all six seasons individually a few months before this megaset came out.
I was young when Dr. Quinn came on, and I watched it every Saturday night for the first few seasons. As the third season waned, I entered my upper teen years, and I had better things to do with my Saturday nights (and TiVo didn't exist yet).
For years, all I had were a few OLD VHS with some episodes we'd recorded, like The Heart Within (forever to be known to me and my sister as Dr. Quinn Goes to Boston).
Finally, one day, I did it--I bought the series. I kept this secret at first, not wanting to admit my great attachment to a show notorious for being adored by grannies the world over. But in time, I became aware of many friends who also remembered the series fondly and was able to loan out my discs to them. I was proud to own them!
While working from home, I found myself zipping through disc by disc, season by season. Approaching the more unfamiliar seasons, I was surprised that right to the end, I immensely enjoyed each episode. The show never seemed to jump the shark.
Now, that being said, I'm not going to ascribe adjectives to this show that it doesn't deserve. It has it's moments of getting a little too sappy or melodramatic. When used, the stock footage is always blatantly obvious. At times the acting is less that Emmy worthy...
But all that doesn't matter to me, because despite its flaws, I love it. Is it because I'm a silly girl who will always have a heart that beats for Sully? Maybe. But it was a great show, the last of its kind.
It was a show that empowered women without demeaning men, covered a wide range of timeless personal, historic, and societal issues, gave a real example of a healthy and successful marriage, taught timeless values, and was full of sweeping romance and thrilling drama.
I've heard of petitions to resurrect the show, I don't know about that, but Dr. Quinn will always hold a place in my heart.",1245196800,,2044,4.482573726541555

What I do is once I have the disk out I leave the disk in the dvd player.  And when we want to see a picture I just open the drive and close it and the picture comes on to the screen.  We are on disk six and so far the words and the actors/actresses voices are in sink with each other.  The color is beautiful and to date each picture is new to us.  Either we forgot what we saw when it first aired on television or we haven't seen these series.",1243036800,,648,3.871212121212121

3424832,5,B00197POXG,"""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman"" (DQMW) is one of my favorite TV series ever.  Since the series ended in 1998, numerous fans in the US and abroad (myself included) have been waiting with bated breath for the series to be released on DVD.  Over the years, certain episodes and individual seasons were released on VHS and DVD, but fans of the show were never able to own the ENTIRE series on DVD ... until now.

DQMW was the type of series that caught on with viewers from the get-go.  I was completely hooked from the first time I saw the DQMW Pilot on January 1, 1993.  The Pilot was so well done and I enjoyed it so much that I couldn't wait to tune in for the 2nd episode, ""Epidemic,"" the following night.  Apparently, I was not alone: DQMW defied all expectations and became a hit with millions of viewers from the beginning.

The series featured the character of Dr. Michaela (""Mike"") Quinn, a female doctor from Boston, Massachusetts in the mid-1860's.  Faced with the impenetrable glass ceiling that frustated women doctors at that time, Dr. Mike relocated to the Colorado Territory on the old US frontier.  There, she adjusted to her new life in Colorado Springs, adopted the 3 orphan children of her deceased friend, dealt with the townsfolks' initial mistrust of a ""lady doctor,"" and encountered the brooding, mysterious ""mountain man"" and friend of the Cheyenne Indians, Byron Sully (""Sully"").  Eventually, Dr. Mike gained the respect and friendship of the townsfolk, the familial love of her children, and the undying, romantic love of the elusive Sully.  As a series featuring a pioneering, educated woman (Dr. Mike) finding professional, emotional and spiritual fulfillment in the face of tremendous odds, DQMW provided a positive role model for many young women.

The series addressed a variety of timeless topics, such as: Race & gender discrimination; physical & psychological diseases & cures; death; the effects of modernization & technology; family issues; growing up & teenage life; politics & US history; financial issues; romance (lots of it!); and marriage, pregnancy & childbirth. DQMW tackled it all (and then some!), all while preserving its status as a family show that could be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.

As a hopeless romantic, I was (and still am) a huge supporter of the epic romance between DQMW's lead characters, Michaela and Sully. The Michaela & Sully wedding episode was an ""event"" that I'll never forget. Joe Lando and Jane Seymour were pure MAGIC together onscreen, with an acting chemistry that comes along only once in a blue moon.  Simply put, they just don't make TV series like DQMW anymore.

After a few years of surviving on Hallmark channel reruns of DQMW (until 2005), and the occasional internet clips, I recently fell in love with the series all over again when I bought this Complete Series Megaset when it was (finally!) released in the Fall of 2008. I've watched the entire series again from soup-to-nuts, and the 2 movies, which are included in the Megaset. And I've been reminded of why I adored DQMW in the first place.  If you were a fan of DQMW back in the 1990's, you're looking for a quality family show to share with your kids, or you're a hopeless romantic, the ""Dr. Quinn"" Complete Series Megaset is for you!",1242345600,7,3272,4.836917562724015

As did other people who reviewed this set, I noticed that sometimes the DVD's voices would be out of sync, but like others wrote, all I had to do was eject it and put it back in. I also noticed that the DVD's played better on older DVD players, it wasn't as clear or smooth on the newer DVD players. I was very satisfied with the price, and I absolutely LOVE the series and love being able to share it with my children!",1237766400,2,465,4.1208791208791204

3424838,5,B00197POXG,"I'm glad I waited for this complete series set to come out, I ended up getting the holiday sale (maybe pre-order) price of 89.99 which isn't much more than a single season. I used to love watching this show in syndication, then lost the station it was played on with a cable change.

Packaging could use some work. I was tempted to give this a 4 star rating because of the packaging, but I myself can't come up with a better solution for the 42 discs in this series without it weighing a ton or taking up an entire shelf. I just wish discs were easier to remove and replace, the slip in/out cases make me paranoid for scratches. That and I'm waiting for the heavy paper/cardboard to start to tear with use.

Overall, a good set finally came out for this series. So, 5 stars for the complete series, even though I don't like the packaging, the product works as it should.",1237593600,,870,4.331288343558282

3424842,3,B00197POXG,"I purchased this product in lieu of keeping all of the video tapes I had (for space reasons).  It comes in a compact case which I like.  However, it is difficult sometimes to access the DVD I want with so many of them crammed into a small space.  Also, the front and back of the case are glued on and one side was coming off and I had to glue it back on again.  After reading other people's reviews before purchasing the product, I was wary of the sound quality.  I have had some problems after only watching the first 3 DVD's with them skipping or not starting up correctly.  After ejecting the DVD and re-starting it, the problem seems to go away.  I really wish they had close captioning on these DVD's though.",1234224000,6,713,4.276119402985074

- For international customers: Though the megaset doesn't come with any dubbing or subtitles whatsoever, I am thrilled by the fact that it is NOT limited to the American region code 1. It will play on pretty much all DVD players worldwide. Thank you, A&E Home Video! If you order, please be aware that you might have to pay extra V.A.T. (MwSt.) and/or customs fees (They charged me an extra of approx. 30.-$).
- Any customers: If you order because of the ""faux-leather"" look etc., please don't. The packaging is functional and looks nice enough, but I wouldn't want to put it on display. If you buy for the content, you'll be very happy with the megaset. I think it's a great price for what you get, and they did a very beautiful job in designing the DVD menues.

3424851,5,B00197POXG,"This is a mammoth undertaking of 42 DVD's with more than 120 recorded hours.  It was purchased as a birthday gift and true to their word, Amazon had it to us in two days despite being ordered during the height of the Christmas shipping season.  The recipient is delighted and has enjoyed it daily since it arrived December 15th.  It plays well on a new Magnavox ZV450MW8 VCR/DVD recorder with digital tuner, but some disks have glitches when played on a bargain DVD player.  The DVD's contain multiple episodes and in a few of them, we couldn't play the second and third episode on the $29 DVD player.  As I said, this problem did not occur on the newer equipment.  It's disconcerting only because the problem is intermittent; it does not occur across all the disks, but only on some of them.  The set includes all six seasons and both full length movies, and anyone who was a fan when the series aired will find this well worth the investment. I'd forgotten the attention to historical detail and the recurring themes supportive of traditional family values.  It's something we'll be sure to point out to our infant children as they grow into their formative years.",1231718400,,1166,4.6536585365853655
3424852,5,B00197POXG,"No doubt about it, the complete series of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman provides a wallop in good clean entertainment.  In all this series has forty-two discs and if you factor in the cost of the entire series you are looking at a tad over a dollar per episode.  Keep in mind there are three or four episodes on each disc, episodes you can watch time and time again if you so choose. The movies are also included.  I've read all the other reviews, agree with some points and beg to differ on others.  I'm giving this series five stars, not for its minor glitches, but for the series itself.  It's just plain old wonderful!

The packaging was well thought out.  Each disc is firmly tucked in its respective pocket, each page is glued back to back with the next and therefore the discs seem tight.  I simply tuck a finger under the paper in the front, reach in with my spare hand and carefully remove the disc.  The ring bound book can be tucked inside an accompanying hard cover sleeve to really keep the dust and grime out.

I like the fact that there is a good table of contents, index and brief summaries under each disc in the book.  If anyone can recall a favorite episode, it's easy to find!  Not being as familiar with the series as I'd only seen a few, I find that when I put a disc in and click for an episode there is a more in depth recap of each story.  They're all so good I haven't skipped one over yet.

Glitches?  Well, I suppose you can find a glitch in anything if you look hard enough.  The only one that irks me can be easily remedied.  The voices are not in sync on many of the discs.  I opted not to return the series as it was a great buy.  I either rewind slightly or open my DVD player and put the disc back in.  That little move is an easy, quick fix and voila!  The voices are right back on track giving me my entertainment fix for the evening.  If you are an easy going person this ""fixable"" glitch won't bother you, but if you are a perfectionist it might drive you batty.",1231372800,2,1995,4.167539267015707

This was not clear to me from the product description provided and since the website stated that the movies were frequently ordered with the megaset I took that to mean they were not included.  So I ordered the movies separately and now will have to return them.

The series itself is worthdefinitely 5 stars.  However I gave an overall rating of 4 stars because of the packaging.  Although a very innovative way to hold all these DVDs in a compact space, it was not as sturdy as I expected and the so-called ""faux leather"" is more like thick brown cardboard.  The leather tie is not a tie at all since it was only attached to the front cover and not the back.  Perhaps it is broken but I didn't see anything that suggested it was ever attached to the back cover.  Despite these packaging issues I will not return the set because the main thing are the DVDs themselves and they are wonderful!
