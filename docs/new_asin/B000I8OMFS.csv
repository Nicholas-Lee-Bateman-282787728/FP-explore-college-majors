2653658,3,B000I8OMFS,"I absolutely loved the first two movies in the Pusher trilogy, but it looks like I'll be the lone dissenter on Amazon in my review of the third.

Milo, played by the talented Zlatko Buric, become one of my favorite bad guys in film with the original Pusher movie. What I loved about Milo in the first movie was that on the surface he was friendly and charismatic, but with a real sense of danger just beneath the surface. In Pusher III, Milo's a bit softer, more vulnerable and simply less frightening.

I thought the use of gore in the film was overdone and unnecessary, it didn't add anything of value to the movie. I also felt that Milo's descent was too much of a parallel to that of Ray Liotta's character in Goodfellas, the day he has to juggle multiple tasks while coked out of his mind.

What I do give the credit for is giving Zlatko Buric a bit more to work with as a rounded character (even if it's not my cup of tea), and an exploration of the unrelenting grasp that crime bosses must keep on their business.

Most people who watched the first two movies in the trilogy seem to love this film, so you should definitely give it a watch. Even though I'm a fan of Buric's work, and think Milo is a terrific character, I could have honestly done without this movie. It's good, but the plot just didn't move me, I would have given it more stars had the concept been more original.",1269648000,3,1387,4.302681992337165

2653684,4,B000I8OMFS,"I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in Copenhagen and alternative realities. It's really a fantasy where criminals live with virtual impunity from the law and take a Wild West approach to their community interactions. Who are these people you want to ask?

The farcical and dark humor elements are disconcerting at times.  For example milo goes to an old acquaintance who has gone straight and vows never to let anyone drag him back into the very dark life of this clan. Yet moments later he is torturing and butchering people. This isn't planet earth.",1362614400,,566,4.885416666666667
2653685,3,B000I8OMFS,"I enjoyed much of the ride here.  Dark humor was very much in evidence and the movie was rolling along with that weird ""Pusher"" momentum.  It got more than a little grotesque at the end though, without much point I think, and left a bad taste in this viewer's mouth.  Which made it my least favorite of this trilogy.",1349827200,2,316,4.322033898305085

But when a drug distribution negotiation gets out of control, Milo is wrapped in a sordid game of victim-victimizer. And for the welfare of his family only has one night to clear this whole bloody mess.

It is a volatile film full of graphic violence all possible, but done with great pulse, nervous camera work, within the mainstream of cinema-verit.

A cult film from 2005. Don't miss the last Op of this magnificent Trylogy.",1318896000,4,565,4.926315789473684

8144346,4,B000I8OMFS,"The conclusion to the Pusher trilogy is just as great as its first two chapters.  This one follows Serbian drug czar Milo as he copes with his drug addiction, arranges his daughter's 25th birthday party and deals with the fallout of an incorrect drug shipment at the same time.  In true Pusher fashion, all of Milo's attempts to rebound from the botched shipment cause a downward spiral of calamity that threaten his personal and professional lives.  His attempt at keeping his evil persona in check is reminiscent of the personal struggles of other fictional gangsters like Carlito Brigante and Tony Soprano, but Milo's situation is unique enough to not seem like it is aping either property.  I also like how other characters from the first two movies reprise their roles, which makes it seem like a true conclusion to the series.  A word of warning, however: this entry is not for the squeamish. While Pusher 1 and 2 had their fair share of violence and gore, this entry makes both of them seem tame.",1501459200,,1003,4.741379310344827
8144347,5,B000I8OMFS,I'll make this review short.  I completely disagree with the top three reviewers.  This is one of the best crime films ever made.  The chilling and unsensational depiction of violence and the slow and dreary downfall of a crime boss makes this film practically unrivaled.  The best in the series.,1487808000,,296,4.86

8144349,4,B000I8OMFS,"As with the other two films, this is an interesting character study more than anything. The drug, crime, and violence are just part of the story and are not glorified which in turn adds to the realism. The cliffhanger endings with no resolution almost suggests that this is just an interesting day in the life (to a very limited extent) of all involved characters. There is no satisfaction at the ending which is effective in that you realize the characters just keep living their lives. There is an amount of tension that builds and builds and is released in ways that one wouldn't expect. It is very interesting that NWR basically made the same film three times as everything about them is very similar and the ""protagonists"" are equally flawed with few redeeming qualities. I will say that III is slightly more disappointing toward the end as the story basically stops and focuses on some unnecessarily gory parts which seems to have become part of NWR's trademark...",1479427200,,970,4.81437125748503
8144350,5,B000I8OMFS,"This is the best Disney movie I have seen yet!  Well, maybe not, but being half-Danish, I had to give this flick a try. Milo is a very likeable godfather figure in spite of his flaws and line of work. He is further proof that ""Old School"" is still the better way. The last part had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe. Not everyone will have the same reaction though. All this brutal insanity and not one shot fired. That's the Denmark I know.",1475107200,,446,4.247058823529412
8144351,3,B000I8OMFS,"Pusher III: I'm the Angel of Death followed the Milo criminal character from the first two installments of the franchise.  Milo is the most charismatic character in the series, yet his story has the thinnest plot.  Pusher III is a foreign language film with subtitles, set in Norway.  It's part of a trilogy showcasing the European underworld of transnational, multi-ethnic crime networks running contraband on the black market,  This is the EU you don't see, save for these films.  The Pusher trilogy also showcases the directorial style of Nicolas Winding Refn which can only be described as art deco neo-noir.  Wefn pictures are often brutal, like Tarrantino, with English sensibilities.  The characters are real European and may not be recognizable to Americans, such as Albanians.

The characters lack development.  It's part of an overall melange, incorporating loose moving parts and recurring characters fulfilling their only roles as minor plot points.  As in the previous two Pusher features, the pace is frenetic, conveying the wildness of desperation in a day in a life on the edge.  All three contain a theme of racing against time in an attempt to dodge fate, with a recurring theme of the volatile, unpredictable nature of the drug racket.  The film does not glorify drug use, other than showing cool looking people imbibing and dealing.  Setting that aside, Pusher strips down the gangster myth to expose the desperate schemers living in a state of constant fear.  It's a toxic environment of poison.

The best scene comes when Milo has a run-in with a slavetrafficker.  As with the rest of Pusher III, it was disjointed from the body of the picture.

Refn is a director who can qualify as an old-fashioned auteur from the same stock that made Bergman and gave birth to the existential movement.  His pictures have grit, cinematography, adrenalin, sex, violence, crime, and noir aesthetic.  The guy who plaid Serbian drug dealer Milo was great.  His adult daughter was introduced as a hot princess.  Like the other character, she serves more as a prop in a suped up, live action puppet show of sorts.  It's Charlie Countryman meets Illtown.",1470700800,,2156,5.014084507042254
8144352,4,B000I8OMFS,"Humanizes Milo, shows him in one of his conceivably worst nights.  A dirty gory crime movie that doesn't dramatize the situation like every other film.  It's just a s***ty night with a sad and s***ty crime boss who isn't the best at what he does.  Still not as good as the second one.",1462838400,,284,4.320754716981132
8144353,5,B000I8OMFS,"I caught this movie by accident on Netfli . It is an amazing movie about drug dealing, family, and even a sense of morality while still being involved in the dirty, underworld of illegal busines . Amazing movie.",1433894400,,211,4.578947368421052
8144354,3,B000I8OMFS,"In the third (and final) installment of Nicolas Winding Refn's PUSHER trilogy, he takes a look at the Serbian drug lord from the previous two films, Milo. Taking place over the course of a day, it follows Milo as he has to balance preparing for his daughter's birthday celebration and try to work out a drug deal involving ecstasy pills (that he thought were going to be heroin). It's also revealed in the film's first scene that he's a member of Narcotics Anonymous. What makes the film, or at least Milo, compelling is the way he balance his personal and professional lives. He also struggles with addiction as he peddles drugs to other people. These discrepancies are what make him a complex and interesting character despite being surrounded with a bunch of one-note gangster/pusher types. Perhaps it's because I was a bit burned out from the previous two, but I found that this one didn't do enough different to make me really care about the story. Sure, Milo was interesting enough but by this point it felt like Refn was simply going through the motions. At times, this felt like a slower, feature length version of a rather famous scene in Goodfellas: the one where Henry is high on coke and goes back and forth between his house and several other locations as he cooks and picks up guns, drugs, etc. Still, the PUSHER III does have one scene towards the end where Milo disposes of some bodies that was able to capture some of the brutality and gruesomeness shown in the previous two films. From a technical standpoint, the film is done in a handheld, documentary style that aims, and mostly succeeds at, capturing a day in the life of a gangster. Acting, from what I could tell, seemed to be pretty good or at least on par with the other two films in the trilogy. The score this time wasn't as memorable, but there were a couple key moments that were punctuated with a sound resembling the Hans Zimmer ""bwwaaaaaaa"" that has become common-place in movie trailers. Overall, I didn't find this film as interesting as PUSHER II, but it still was a well-made film and I'd be hard-pressed to call it ""bad."" If you've seen the other two, by all means check this out. If not, I'd stick with the first two (especially the second one).",1430870400,2,2234,4.601503759398496
