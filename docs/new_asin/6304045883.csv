He got bored and I used him as an excuse to leave the movie and amuse  him in the lobby. Five or ten minutes went by and I was approched by the  theater manager. ""You must be watching Bio Dome"", he said. I  responded with ""yes I'm afraid so"". He said, ""I've been  manager since they opened this theater up, and I believe this movie holds  the record for walk-outs"". It was BAD!",916876800,8,531,4.0673076923076925

It hasn't held up well over time, and although I love movies with dumb humor, I just felt myself getting more and more annoyed as the movie went on. It's harmless fun, and it was interesting to see all of the cameos from certain performers early on in their careers, but If you are craving a bumbling buddy flick that won't give you a headache, watch Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure instead.",1506729600,2,536,4.213592233009709

Watching it now, 20 some years later, I think I have slightly more appreciation for it.  It has a premise that I can't imagine ever seeing in another movie again.  Two dudes with less than noble intentions end up inside of a habitat sealed off from the rest of the world.  And both lead characters are obnoxious to the point that I can't believe producers were actually okay with it.

What this film becomes is so horribly abrasive to my sensibilities that I actually have to applaud it.  The two main characters annoy me so much that it wraps around to being perversely captivating.

The actual plot is just okay, but as I mentioned before, it's rather unique.  And it does fit in line with the idea of conservation and planet saving that was a big movement back in the 90's.

The real reason to see this movie is to just sit back and be amazed at how completely, and shockingly obnoxious the lead duo is.  I took this for granted when I was younger, and just passed this movie off as being trash.  Now I'm glad that it exists.  I don't think it's a very good movie, but as a curiosity, I think this film has some merit.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone expecting an entertaining film, or even to watch it ironically.  I'd really recommend this as a bizarre time capsule that probably shouldn't exist.  But it does, and I'm happy for it.",1458172800,4,1529,4.2717770034843205

786168,4,6304045883,"Same old movie we watched years ago so since most people are familiar with the movie itself I'll review the quality of this Bluray release. Sadly they made only a limited amount of DVD's and they dried up, a few sold here on Amazon for $40-$45 but it was just plain hard to find them new, and of course buying DVD's used is a crapshoot since those are often scratched. I got this Bluray for a bit under $20 new and there seems to be plenty in stock, probably a new production run. There is a good amount of graininess and you can tell it's older non-HD filmstock but it looks better than an upscaled DVD. This happens with lots of older movies on Bluray I've been buying, they sit between a DVD and a true HD movie in quality with sharp lines on every detail like in HD movies but with a good amount of the blotchy graininess upscaled DVD's suffer. It's still Bio-Dome regardless and this is the cheapest way to get a new copy of the movie, you also get the benefits of Bluray discs which are really hard to scratch on accident and higher quality. No special features, when you get to the main menu you can play the movie or select a chapter. I never really bother with commentaries and whatnot so that doesn't really bug me. I docked one star only because the graininess is almost overbearing on some scenes and seems somewhat worse than the Bluray version of Aliens I have which is a much older movie.",1439683200,,1403,4.318181818181818

786224,4,6304045883,"Bio-Dome's been a long time favorite of mine.. had to get the Blu-Ray.

The disc contains only the movie (no special features) - the video is pretty good (the first 5-minutes look awful, but once the movie actually starts it's better than I expected. Seems to be a bit over-saturated but that could be how it always looked). A good amount of grain, but the picture is sharp.

Audio, on the other hand, is only in DTS 2.0 (the DVD from 13 years ago even had a 5.1 track)

This could be forgiven, but the high price on this release makes it a bit iffy -- the movie looks great, sounds ""good"" for most of it (the beginning was really bad - sounded much better on the DVD).

786554,5,6304045883,"Often referred to as the Rosebud of the X Generation, Bio-Dome is the pinnacle of the tragic comedy at its finest. As we follow our two protagonist through a morally challenging struggle between what is right and what is fun, we are stretched to imagine a world where happiness and a clean Earth cannot coexist. This reviewer was brought to tears by the sincerity of our main characters, knowing all too well the many real life experiences that were brought together to create such pure acting genius. Given we only can cherish this 1 hour and 34 minutes of bliss, I cannot emphasize enough the platitude of righteousness that will raise up within you as you soak in what could possibly be noted as 1996's tribute the fundamental breakdown in our lives, the struggle of good versus evil, and the beauties which always tempt us to raise ourselves to the next plane of consciousness. Only trumped by the pure beauty of Joey Lauren Adams, the inner angst of William Atherton reveals his ever increasing struggle to challenge the champions of this story in their pursuit of what would end up being the fate of this planet.  Guest appearances by musical sensations Tenacious D (Jack Black and Kyle Gass) take this epic adventure to audio delights which this reviewer can only just sigh at, with such baited pleasure, begging for more. At this, I am left speechless, begging for a sequel and yet again brought to tears, crying myself to sleep nightly knowing that greatness like this can only truly ever be experienced once in a lifetime.",1381276800,4,1532,4.7593984962406015

786688,3,6304045883,"Bio-Dome compels one to ponder one of life's most inexplicable mysteries: how could Pauly Shore be given the opportunity to make out with both Kylie Minogue and Joey Lauren Adams - and actually get paid a good sum of money for the privilege?  I mean, come on - that is just wrong on so many levels.  Oh man, Joey Adams ...  Sorry.  What was I talking about?  Oh, yeah, Bio-Dome.  This is a really dumb movie; in fact, this may be the dumbest movie Pauly Shore ever made, and that's really saying something.  Pauly Shore isn't even the dumbest character in this movie; he's a veritable da Vinci compared to Stephen Baldwin's character.  These two guys are almost too dumb to live for the first half of the film.  Then, somehow or other, things start to turn around and - despite numerous moments of utter crudity - you end up not hating the film in the end.  There are even a few nice surprises along the way, such as what I believe to be the first film performance by Jack Black and Kyle Gass (Tenacious D) and a couple of scenes with a young Rose McGowan.  Oh man, Rose McGowan ...

Bud Macintosh (Pauly Shore) and his bud Doyle Johnson (Stephen Baldwin) are two incredibly stupid slacker college students who somehow have hot girlfriends (Joey Adams and Teresa Hill).  The girls are devoted environmentalists, so the boys are constantly going to extremely stupid lengths to get out of attending environmental events with them.  The only way these guys could possibly care about Mother Nature is if she started stripping.  So it is not without a heavy dose of irony when they accidentally find themselves trapped within the new Bio-Dome outside of town, having mistaken the place for a mall.  With the doors locked until the next Earth Day 365 days later, they're in there for the long haul alongside the five dedicated scientists who actually volunteered to live there for a year.  As you can well imagine, the constant adolescent actions of Bud and Doyle cause nothing but trouble - disaster, actually.  As you can probably guess, it's ultimately up to them to save the whole Bio-Dome project after personally destroying it, and it is here that the film finally takes a turn for the better.

I don't dislike Pauly Shore as much as most people seem to.  Son-in-Law is a comedy classic, as far as I'm concerned, but that features a somewhat mellow Pauly Shore.  Taken in excess, Shore can be incredibly annoying, especially when teamed up with another brain-dead character like Doyle.  I really didn't enjoy the first half of this movie.  When the guys finally take on a little bit of responsibility, start acting like they have at least one or two neurons actually firing in their brains, and stop acting like complete idiots all of the time, some actual comedy is finally given room to come to the surface.  I'm not saying there aren't a lot of crude and stupid moments in the second half of the film because there are plenty of them.  I'm just saying that the comedy finally becomes something you can actually laugh at and enjoy down the stretch.  It's enough for me to give the film three stars overall.",1321401600,,3108,4.625912408759124

786697,2,6304045883,"America was facing an environmental hazard, and its name was Pauly Shore.  He's the type of actor few people love and many people hate, for his drowsy delivers and cackling laughs.  I don't harbor any real hatred to this guy, but I sure wouldn't want to bring him to any box socials.  There's a certain understand that ""Bio-Dome"" can drive certain people crazy, and it's almost true for me.

Judging by the spastic, ""Liquid Television""-esque opening credits, I can tell this movie was gonna be annoying.  It's about two brain-dead, Gen-X potheads named Bud (Shore) and Doyle (Stephen Baldwin) who don't want to get involved in any of their girlfriends' environmentalist activities.  By accident, they thought a large contained habitable laboratory is a newly-opened mall, and once they got inside, they're stuck with a bunch of scientists (and two models pretending to be scientists) in a locked environment called the Bio-Dome for a year.  The result is basically the equivalent of having two hyenas surrounding a pack of rabbits in a field of flowers: utter carnage.  A good majority of the movie is just Bud and Doyle gawking and destroying whatever they can get their hands on.  And they're the good guys, those that somehow impress Kylie Minogue and the chick from ""Chasing Amy"".  Somehow, I can't help but sympathize with the Bio-Dome project lead and antagonist, Dr. Faulkner (William Atherton); he tried to expunge them, and why not?  That person only went crazy later in the film is because of those goofballs' utter insistence to party hard and wreck everything.

Not even a brief Tenacious D cameo can prevent the movie from its unfunny, irritating anarchy. And yet, I can't bring myself to call ""Bio-Dome"" a terrible movie.  It's an eye-roller, but I might be misunderstood.

As hopelessly dense as the duo were, at least they're believably stupid; Pauly Shore's performance is pretty much what I expect from this guy, slow and unfocused.  At least he and Stephan are pretty mellow with their insanity, plus it doesn't have characters that are dumber than those two; as a valid rule of dumb comedies, if the side characters are dumber than the leads whether by tolerating or accepting their behavior, then the movie would only insult me rather than please me.

And the characters are two-dimensional.  However, there are some really strange, weird, funny jokes in it that made me laugh.

To all the people who didn't like it - I understand that Pauly might not strike you as funny.  There is a fine line between really annoying and funny - and for me Pauly is on the funny side of that line.  However, for the folks who think that it has no worth, that all copies should be destroyed, and nobody in the world should ever watch it again - Really?  Thank goodness we don't live in a dictatorship and that you're not in charge of approving what everybody watches.

Absolutely the worst ""comedy"" ever made. At no point in this wretched movie does anything remotely funny happen. Its almost as though they tried to be crap. Pauly and his bud played by the youngest and least talented Baldwin, Whatsisname, get into an experimental biodome that is then sealed so they can't leave and the hilarity begins. Or at least that's how it looked on paper. The script seems to have been only an outline because much of the time Pauly and Whatshisname appear to be improvising. Perhaps to them what they did seemed funny, possibly because of the drugs they were on at the time? Or maybe lack of sleep? I don't know because no one other than the two ""stars"" were laughing. Imagine two high schooler age children of average intelligence were given a budget and a bare bones script outline and told to make it up as they went along. Biodome is what you'd get.

I thought the relationship between him and Stephen Baldwin bordered on homosexuality,which seemed kind of weird and wondered,why would the 2 girls be interested in these 2 in the first place??

He never did do anything beyond his ""weasel"" persona,like Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey did with their career. I guess he didn't have the talent to pursue anything else and so he faded into oblivion,which seemed that nobody else missed him.

""No, I am god...""

This is obviously an important flick, with over 100 reviews on Amazon.  Most rave, a few bash -- almost none in the middle.  It could be mindset, maybe political bent.  But I feel sorry for those who cannot appreciate this little gem, an outrageously hilarious, quotable romp with a message!  Yes, maybe the message is mixed with fart and stoner humor, but Bud and Doyle (the Frog and the Squirrel) who ""own this place, total!"" really grow and realize that they have ""made Vasquez lake"" and ""have to fix it"".  They are not some ""shaved down pool Nazis"" they want to ""free the Mahi-mahi, if you will..."" and they go from guys who ""can't cork it (negatory)"" wanting to ""pee in your Jurassic mall"" to rejects even within the closed world of the Biodome:  ""I'm going to start my own dome, like a dome within a dome... so don't come knocking on my door!...""  To formulating a plan to fight back after Doyle single-handedly and in one (mouth filled with Pizza) sentence ""Don't give me any of that bourgeois/smourgeois -- gimme the drink, gimme the drink..."" wins back his Photocopier-employed friend to make the flyers: ""Have a beer with a deer...""

A better environmental piece than even Koyaanisqatsi.  Almost as much fun as ""Dancing. Naked. Want us to take of all our clothes, feed us some weird punch...""

I disagree that it's not right for kids.  I think they should show it in the schools.  (Current music is much more suggestive.)  And my kids have watched it (with supervision) since an early age.  We quote it all the time to each other a crack up.  It is an endless source of family humor.  we have watched it dozens of times together.  Just a really great flick all around.  I would give it six stars if I could.

So all I can say to the inimitable Pauly Shore is ""Thank you Naomi!""",1161216000,9,1852,4.518072289156627

It takes a trained eye and a good writer to find scripts that are unique.  I read a review on BioDome on Apollo Movie Guide by Ryan Cracknell.  He bashed this movie up and down.  I can't understand why because it has some good qualities.  I read other reviews that he has done and found that Ryan Cracknell has the inablility to write good reviews.  He lacks focus and his narrow minded thinking leaves him behind good writers for he has never had anything worth while produced.

This movie has its appeal to a lot of people, but But this movie to me is probably the biggest waste of time ever. The story is so bad you actually don't even care if the actors do a good job, if it was well made if the story is coherent etc. The main characters are of course extremely annoying. The supporting cast, and their roles are all stupid of not bad caricatures. Any joke with potential is unfinished or destroyed before you can start to smile.

Follow me:

It is so bad alcohol can't save it.

It is so bad it makers Adam Sandler hilarious.

It is so bad we never got to see the actors in a serious role ever again.

It is so bad they tried to include actual attempts of an edicational value and a moral in the story (of course concealed by the anti-moral way it is expressed)

But the worst part is, many bad movie become funny from how bad it is and many movies for young people can appeal to older. This one does not.

The story is about two best friends who haven't used their brain-cells for a few years  making fun wherever they are whenever they can, some potential. This movie is about two idiots screwing op a serious scientiffic experiment, only a few actors could make something from this. This movie is about how the people from the experiment deal with the two fools, great potential (especially the investor's attempts to turn the problem to his advantage). But none of the potential is fulfilled, instead we got one of the dumbest movies ever, and probably every movie gets funny from being dumb, but this one does not even do that.",1104883200,3,1652,4.340909090909091

I watched this move twice with two groups of guys and said nothing and everyone in each group said the same thing afterwards.

Pauly 'The Weasel' Shore and Stephen Baldwin star as Bud and Doyle, two losers (there's a casting surprise!) who, thinking they are going to a mall, inadvertently get trapped within a futuristic 'Bio-Dome' scientific research station, and hilarity (allegedly) ensues. This makes 'Chairman of the Board' starring Carrot Top look like a serious contender for an Academy Award. Adding to the agony is an early screen appearance by the mega-untalented Jack Black, as if Pauly and Stephen weren't more than enough to discourage you.
'Bio-Dome' is essentially a glimpse of the hilarity that goes on in a seventh grade boy's locker room. Jokes about K-Y Jelly and flatulence abound, so if you think that is utterly hilarious, this movie may be for you.

787093,5,6304045883,"This movie is one of the best movies ive ever seen. It is funny beyond  any thing out there. It starts with ""two dumb punks"" and they accidenally mistake the Bio-Dome for a mall. Therefore they get locked inside for a full year. They cuase alot of trouble and do alot of funny things, and terrorize the scientists who where planning to live there. WARNING: This movie is not for everyone. If your the type who enjoys boring opras and hates crude hummor and  alot of laughs, then steer clear(if your that type I don't know why you would be look at Pauly Shore movies anyway....). But if not that type I think you should enjoy this movie for ages.

Together they land themselves in a major scientific experiment. The story is well dumb, but could have better if actual funny people could have played their roles.

Its only for immature people and whoever didn't think it was the littlest part of ""FUNNY"" were either people above 21 or they were just to mature to see this movie.  The only movie or show for that matter they could think was funny would be like something on HGTV. Like that show Trading Spaces. Or maybe some flick like...I don't really know at the moment but something that u have to have an IQ above 150 for.

787100,1,6304045883,"Pauly Shore, I hear, is a bit of a joke in the US.
I have seen quite a few PS movies in the past, Encino Man being the best (and the only one I can remember the title of!)...
Bio-Dome is something of an all-time career low for Shore, and no doubt has contributed even more to him being the butt of many a joke on real comedy shows such as The Simpsons.
The worst thing about this movie is that you can tell where the writers have tried to steal ideas from, in particular: the Bill & Ted and Wayne's World movies. Unfortuantely, they failed on every level - from the actual ""comedy"" to the performers playing the roles...
For the first time ever, I have watched a movie so bad, with no redeeming things going for it, that I really don't know how to stress how terrible Bio-Dome is.
I could say watch it and find out for yourself but I have a bit more respect for people than the makers of this movie who obviously want to torture rather than entertain.
And what the hell is Kylie Minogue doing here? Babe, you're far more better than that...",1005436800,8,1040,4.205

Your friends may abandon you, your dog will leave you (shave poochie poochie!), and you'll forever be labeled as that sad, bio-dome addict, but hey, who needs a dog anyway? Get a squirrel! (Only make sure he doesn't get anywhere near the fertilizer or kerosene)  I also have to warn you that if you're a snobby movie critic, you will, without a doubt, hate this movie.
