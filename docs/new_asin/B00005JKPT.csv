1450799,5,B00005JKPT,"One of Brigitte Bardot's few high brow films is an amazing modern Space Age parable of the Homer's ""Odyssey"" in which innocuous writer Michel Piccoli allows sleazy creep producer Jack Palance (his best film, hands down) have his way with wife BB...she feels nothing but contempt for Piccoli for his apathy... I'm with her...the screenplay to the proposed film is supposed to be about the death of romance between Ulysses and Penelope in Homer's ""Odyssey"", but life imitates art when the romance between BB and Piccoli rots away due to Piccoli's wimpy attitude toward Palance's lecherous advances towards his wife...then again, Palance clearly reperesents commerce......
This is a superior film to ""Breathless"", IMHO, .. the film is total eye candy, if not due to the awesome BB, then by the gorgeous locations...
Godard really deserves more credit, he's a consummate filmmaker......Breathless, Alphaville, First Name Carmen, Band of Outsiders...",1016323200,33,945,5.391891891891892

I don't like to rank these things (too arbitrary and subjective) but if you are seriously interested in films, then you must see Contempt.  It's one of Godard's more conventional films, but still has his trademark originality and moments that surprise with their unexpectedness.  The whole film is heartbreaking.

1450880,5,B00005JKPT,"Contempt is a great movie. It is one of those movies where it appears to be telling a simple story but it has a lot of hidden messages and symbolism. In order to fully appreciate Contempt, it would help to have a taste for older movies (1963) and for European cinema. Jean-Luc Godard made Contempt at a time when Hollywood was going through a crisis due to losing audience to TV. The landscape for making movies was changing for the worse and a lot of movie stars were moving to TV projects. The financial situation impacted the production of artistic movies, which is something that has gotten progressively worse over the last 10 years (look at all the remakes and nonsense that's playing at the theaters today).

If you are wondering what the contempt is for, I would probably say it is contempt for financial control over artistic integrity and vision although this is probably implicit. On the outside, it appears to be a woman's contempt for her husband (most likely reason that because he seems to be pushing her to the financier, the film producer portrayed by Jack Pallance character). In my opinion, this is not a movie simply about husband and wife relationship. It is about making a film and how the decisions are made more by the producer than the director or the script writer. Ironically, the movie itself suffered similar consequences that it was criticizing. For instance, US producers wanted to see more nude scenes of Briggite Bardot. Jean-Luc Godard agreed to add some nude scenes just to please the producers but they are not very plenty. Jean-Luc Godard only agreed to add them if they fit into the storyline. I think they work perfectly. I kind of smile when I read reviews when the reviewer is complaining about not enough nude scenes by Briggite Bardot because that is the kind of thing that the movie is criticizing.

As for Studio Canal, I think they did a fantastic job with the Blu-ray. So much so that this product is at par with any Criterion Blu-ray release. There is a 52 minutes documentary on the making of Contempt which is awesome. I think just the 52 minutes documentary is worth the purchase. It includes footage from 1960s, interviews, discussions between Fritz Lang and Jean-Luc Godard, more recent interview with Jean-Luc Godard. There is 5-7 minute introduction to the film by a scholar. And there are also other several special features.",1432771200,4,2381,4.762711864406779

1450976,4,B00005JKPT,"Jean-Luc Godard's 1963 film LE MPRIS (Contempt) is the remarkably international story of a French marriage falling apart during an Italian film shoot directed by a German filmmaker and funded by an American producer. Fritz Lang, playing himself, has been making a innovative treatment of Homer's Odyssey, but the boorish Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance) wants a blockbuster, not an art film. Prokosch hires the screenwriter Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli) for a rewrite, hoping to temper Lang's abstraction. Javal has come to Italy with his wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot), and the collapse of their relationship is the central drama of the film. It is in fact Camille's barely-surpressed hatred for her husband that ostensibly gives the film its title.

The project started as a straightforward adaptation of an Alberto Moravia novel. However, once American financing came in, Godard decided to turn the funding back on its source, striking a blow against the Hollywood system by depicting the American producer as a despicable lech, and Fritz Lang as a genius who has long suffered insults. The film's backers wanted Bardot in nude scenes, but Godard fulfills this obligation in a way that is like thumbing his nose at them. The comments by my fellow reviewer Turfseer, left on May 22, 2011, are enlightening in this regard. However, as bitter and somewhat juvenile as Godard's critique of Hollywood may be, I feel that Le MPRIS is saved, indeed occasionally raised to sublime heights, by several elements.

One is the use of colour in this film. Outdoor shots are bleached into colourlessness by the Mediterranean sun, but indoor shots repeatedly feature stunning shades of red and blue. It is almost as if the film itself is alive. I had never seen anything quite like it. Then there's Georges Delerue's film score, which consists mainly of a lush motif on strings that, when Godard choses to overlay the score, repeats endlessly. In spite of its brevity, this motif is more than enough to maintain interest and tug viewers' heartstrings, and one can even see it as a forebear of Minimalism.

Then, Godard had employed Brecht's principle of alienation -- reminding the audience that they are watching a theatrical performance and not real life -- before LE MPRIS, but he goes whole hog with the technique to great effect. For example, near the end of the film we are shown the aftermath of a car crash, where the passengers are impossibly slumped facing in opposite directions and everything is very stylized, I find one of the most memorable shots in cinema.

The Criterion Collection 2-disc release of LE MPRIS has the film on one DVD and extras on the other. The film comes with a great audio commentary track by film scholar Robert Stam. The second disc's extras were mainly shot in the 1960s. There is a conversation between Lang and Godard from 1967, a portrait of Lang shot on the Capri set of LE MPRIS, another short portrait filmed on-set of Godard and Bardot, and a television interview with Godard from just after the film was completed. Finally, cinematographer Raoul Coutard is interviewed around the turn of the millennium.",1382918400,2,3134,4.9751908396946565

1451020,3,B00005JKPT,"I would split the Godard films that I've seen into two camps: the accessible and irreverent and the irreverent and mystifying. Into the former go Breathless, Pierrot le fou, Bande  part, and Vivre sa vie (my favorite). The latter belongs to Le petit soldat, Alphaville, Une femme est une femme, and most definitely, this one. (Yes, I know he has films outside of 'New Wave'. No, that doesn't invalidate my opinion.) Right off the bat, even though the movie has a great director, a great cast and wonderful cinematography, let's dismiss it as entertainment. You will not be entertained, you will not have a good time. Even the harshest, most incisive, innovative and illuminating film must be entertaining.

The plot is basic, too basic. Paul (Michel Piccoli) is a screenwriter who has been hired by boorish producer Jerry Prokosch (Jack Palance) to revise a screenplay to a adaptation of the Odyssey by Fritz Lang, playing himself. The movie starts out well enough with a reflexive shot of Francesca, Prokosch's personal assistant, translator in 4 languages! and lover.  Then Paul meets Prokosch and they review, in Fritz Lang's company, some of the laughable film the great director has already completed.

Then Brigitte Bardot appears as Paul's wife, Camille. Prokosch suggests that Paul and Camille come over for bourgeois social hour. Since Prokosch's car only fits two comfortably, Paul, with Prokosch's acquiescence, suggests that Camille ride with Prokosch and in doing so subtly pimps his wife out to the producer and almost dissolves their marriage. What follows is a roundabout examination between husband and wife over what happened between the time Prokosch and Camille on one hand, and Paul, on the other, arrive at his house. The only thing shown is Camille trying on some hats, but maybe that happened some other time between Paul and Camille. In another plane, Prokosch and Paul play another game where Camille is the prize and the playing piece, and Fritz Lang's delightfully paternal and even-handed character watches, disinterested, in the background. Francesca, naturally, would be a human chair or a woman-ottoman.

This is the kind of story that would have worked much better in the hands of Ingmar Bergman, where the characters would have badgered each other for a while but then erupted into great detail of what was bothering them. Instead, you get the sense that, just like the characters test each other's boundaries and patience, Godard is also trying to test your patience, viewer, by repeating the same climactic piece of music at intervals where nothing has transpired, by recording Paul and Camille in the scene arguing 'about the space of half an hour', albeit realistically, each waiting for the other to confess or testify, by listening to Palance speak in English to Paul and then listen again to Francesca's translation and vice-versa (which, when you think about it, is annoying to both English and French speakers, and doubly annoying to speakers of English and French).

In summary: this film is like a scale where the talents and fame of all those involved was placed on one side, and the desire to annoy the audience is on the other side, the scale swinging back and forth throughout the film. Worth watching if you've run through the better films of that era, or to see something with Brigitte Bardot.

The story of a failing marriage told through the prism of international filmmaking, it's mostly a chamber piece. in typical Godard fashion, the two lead characters are both recognizable and enigmatically opaque.

My only complaint with the movie is that it's kinda glum. The sprightliness only creeps in at the edges.",1357603200,,452,4.947368421052632
1451027,2,B00005JKPT,"While I don't consider myself a Godard fan, I find Vivre sa vie and Une femme est une femme to be excellent.  And Breathless is one of my all-time favorite films.

Why don't I like this one?

First, it relies too much on technology to convey its message.  We are treated to grand outdoor shots of the regions surrounding Rome and Capri.  Somehow this seascape is supposed to represent the visions beheld by Odysseus upon his return to Greece (among other things), but anyone who has visited the area will tell you right away that Italy isn't Greece; the two landscapes are markedly different.

Second is the moronic score by Georges Delerue.  This was a composer who wrote generally interesting scores (including the disorienting one for Hiroshima, mon amour).  In this case, he sounds like he's trying to emulate Mahler, while lacking Mahler's depth and genius for orchestration.  And while the theme is pretty, it is played over and over and over.  And over.  Again and again.  Barf.

Third, the performances are poor.  Brigitte Bardot plays a superficial character with utter indifference.  This is a no-no.  There has to be something to draw us into examining this character, and it just isn't there.  And Bardot doesn't even look all that good here.  Her hair is bleached a terrible color and is continually falling into her face.

As for the other principals, Jack Palance (who wasn't that great an actor, admittedly) gives a wooden and feeble performance as a big-shot producer, who supposedly has no problem seducing the Bardot character (yeah, right).  Michel Piccoli, who was great at portraying edgy and unsavory characters, walks through his role as the milquetoast husband of the Bardot character.  Fritz Lang plays himself and doesn't do too badly, though he obviously is at the end of his tether here.

Someday I'd like to read the underlying Alberto Moravia novel that served as the basis of this picture.  My guess is that there will be a shrewd examination of the tenuousness of relationships and the critical junctures therein.  For now, I'll have to take it on faith, as it's not in this film.

What's to like?  I give one-and-a-half stars for the ironic commentary on the egocentricity and theatricality inherent in big producers and popular movie actors.  I'll give half a star for the gorgeous shots of the Italian coast.  Farther than that I can't go.",1338076800,3,2375,4.87
1451028,5,B00005JKPT,"Godard weaves a simple, linear, tale with CONTEMPT, yet the film possesses boundless complexity. The film also makes fun of lots of ideas, filmic conventions, artists in general -- and itself. But Godard's subtlety allows these myriad themes to flow through the story without encumbering it. One never feels he's watching an intellectual exercise or the tedious result of a filmmaker's auto-eroticism. Which is not to say the film does not self-reference or geek out in the ways ""artsy"" filmmakers often like to geek out, but Godard always tempers these conventions or anti-conventions with a dollop of irony to purify them of any nauseating self-importance. Godard ridicules the egoistic pompousness of the writer, director and producer in the film -- each respectively enamored of his own interpretation of ""The Odyssey,"" to forward his own vision. At the same time, the film suggests that without the inflated artist's ego, great art wouldn't exist. At the filming of CONTEMPT, Godard was already heralded as the founder of the French New Wave and widely considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers who ever lived, but the cynical turn of the knife with which Godard treats the idolatry of artists and their visions belies a lens of gleeful irony with which Godard suggests might be applied to his own work.  All that being said, at the end of the day what really makes it great is the simple tragic love story that pushes the story along.  Highly recommended.",1335484800,2,1467,4.983673469387755

1451070,2,B00005JKPT,"One of France's best known ""New Wave"" auteur was Jean-Luc Godard.  In this film, with a larger budget than usual he tries out bigger scenes and some new equipment from Hollywood.  This includes Cinemascope and Technicolor.  He balances all this new stuff with an old director in a key role, essentially playing himself.  German genius Fritz Lang is shooting a movie that recreates Homer's ""The Odyssey.""  His screenwriter Paul (Michel Piccoli) has two problems.  He and the American producer Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance) do not see eye to eye on what should be in the film.  The other problem is with his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) who is ""falling out of love"" with her husband.  Bardot, who was such a sensation in ""And God Created Woman"", is admittedly stunning and can truly act, but Goddard seems preoccupied with showing her lying nude on her stomach for no other reason than he can.  Nothing wrong with that of course, but there is more to a clothing free Bardot than her butt.

The various vistas of Capri are beautifully shot and the color in this Blu ray disc is excellent.  Unfortunately for this viewer the film is an utter bore.  Palance overacts as he is often does.  Lang is a great director, but not so much an actor.  I give him props however for speaking German, English, French and Italian in the film. Godard wants to be self reflecting or perhaps self meditating but to me he must have been self medicating.  I realize I am in the minority with this evaluation but I had a hard time staying awake.  The package comes with a DTS-HD 2.0 audio and several black and white documentaries and interviews.",1323475200,3,1634,4.680701754385965
1451071,5,B00005JKPT,"This is not actually a review of the Criterion version. The Criterion version of Contempt is out of print with used copies selling for more than 50 dollars. That is more than I can afford to spend on a single DVD. I really wanted to watch this movie, but I don't have a Blu-Ray player, my wi-fi connection is not good enough for streaming, and I could not find an affordable American DVD of this movie. I finally resorted to buying a really cheap, region-free Korean DVD of this movie. The Korean version has no special features. The video coloring is not consistent, and the subtitle translations are sometimes awkward. But I finally got to see this movie without spending insane dollars on a used Criterion copy.

Out of these four movies Contempt is by far Godard's most accessible and easiest to follow film. It has an actual linear plot, very little narrator or text interruptions, and fewer esoteric techniques than the other films. By comparison Alphaville has a plot but it is obscured by lots of philosophical monologuing, Band of Outsiders has a small plot which is incidental to the greater importance of lots of little moments, and Masculin Feminin has very little plot at all. In contrast to these Contempt has a much more straightforward and traditional plot.

Ostensibly Contempt is a film about making a film, but at its core it is really the story of a declining marriage. The film being made is a version of the Odyssey, and Contempt's protagonist develops a new theory about the Odyssey inspired by his own marital problems. What if Odysseus went to fight at Troy because things weren't going so well with him and Penelope at home, and what if it took him 10 years to return because he was in no hurry to get back to a wife who didn't love him anymore? It is a question worth asking and a very striking mental image in this film.

Contempt is the first color Godard film I have seen and has absolutely brilliant cinematography with beautiful images. Star Bridgette Bardot is gorgeous and appears semi-nude in several scenes. Excellent supporting roles include American actor Jack Palance (known for playing cowboy tough guys in movies like City Slickers) and legendary German director Fritz Lang (Metropolis, M) playing himself.

Contempt is an amazing and emotionally moving motion picture. When an affordable US DVD version is released I will be sure to buy it. Until then I highly recommend that you see this movie, even if you have to get a foreign or bootlegged copy.",1314057600,2,3225,5.7405857740585775

1451073,4,B00005JKPT,"Jean Luc Godard together with Francois Truffaut, leadered the radical wing of the emerging French New Wave. But with the years elapsed Godard proved to be by far, the most unabashed filmmaker of all of them.

This film is a referential evidence. Godard -slyly- got to gather Fritz Lang, Jack Palance, Michel Piccoli and the supreme French Goddess by then - Brigitte Bardot - around a clever unsaid issue into Homer's Odyssey : to find out the reason why Ulysses was absent for so long of his beloved Penelope based on the hypothesis she was unfaithful.

Godard takes advantage about this criterion and explores the intimate ups and downs of this no common couple and how the arrival of an American producer will alter the insane affective equilibrium that still remained between both of them.

Of course, the presence of Frtiz Lang is another highlight along the movie, to analyze briefly some observations and ethical considerations.

The fascinating beauty of Bardot shines with sidereal splendor as well as Capri Island in this singular movie that will capture your whole attention from start to finish.

1451074,2,B00005JKPT,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important film in cinematic history.

As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang.

The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's ""The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, ""Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook"". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time.

If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure.

Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'!

In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, ""art should display the principles of its own construction"". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer.

Despite his love for film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, ""Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations"" by Glenn Kenny).

'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.",1306022400,3,5663,5.291434927697441

1451077,4,B00005JKPT,"Cinematically rich! The dissolution of a marriage is poetically juxtaposed to the mythic tale of 'The Odyssey.' This film is also a commentary on artistic compromise and the process of filmmaking.

In the film, only two alternatives are provided, by the producer and director, and Paul chooses a vision. However, in the book, the script writer has his own perspective. Even more telling is the view espoused by the producer in the film (actually the director in the book), reveals a demythologized, anti-heroric, debased world, which Paul fully supports. The compromise is complete!!!",1280880000,,892,6.504201680672269

1451079,5,B00005JKPT,"With Jean-Luc Godard spearheading the French New Wave after many of his other contemporaries have been forgotten, Italian film producer Carlo Ponti and Jean-Luc Godard began work on  the film ""Le Mepris"" (Contempt) in 1963.  A film that would be an adaptation of Alberto Moravia's novel ""The Ghost at Noon"" and also would be Godard's first foray to what can be seen as a commercial film with celebrities, but done the Jean-Luc Godard way.

Known as probably one of Godard's more accessible films, despite known for working with his wife Anna Karina for many of his films prior to ""Le Mepris"", as the film was being looked at as a film to attract international attention, the most photographed woman in the world at the time, Brigitte Bardot, is featured in the film.  Alongside actors Michel Piccoli (""Dillinger is Dead""), Jack Palance and Giorga Moll.  Also, the film would mark a collaboration with Jean-Luc Godard and one of his favorite director's Fritz Lang (""Metropolis"", ""M"", ""Die Nibelungen"") who will be playing the character of a director with the same name and also would reunite Godard with French New Wave's Jacques Rozier (who would direct two documentaries that relate to the film ""Contempt"").

The film revolves around playwright Paul Javal (played by Michel Piccoli) and his wife Camille (played by Brigitte Bardot).  The two are very much in love and spend time with each other but when Paul is called to meet with producer Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) and his interpreter/assistant Francesca Vanini (played by Giorgia Moll), his life is changed when the arrogant producer is not thrilled with the screenplay of the movie that Fritz Lang has shot.

Paul is paid $10,000 to write a new screenplay for the commercial version of ""Ulysses and his Odyssey"" which will be directed by Fritz Lang.  For Paul, this sounds like an excellent chance for him to pay off the apartment where he and Camille live.  So, when Camille goes to meet with Paul, Prokosch looks as if he is more interested in getting to know Paul's wife.  In fact, he allows her to ride with him (in his two-seater Alfa Romero) to his place while he goes to fetch a taxi.

By the time he arrives, Paul notices his wife is upset and distant and he can't understand why she is upset.  While his wife is sulking, Paul flirts around with the translator Francesca and gives her a tap on the bottom which Camille catches him doing.  For Paul, this is no big deal.

But when they arrive home, Camille tells him that she no longer loves him in fact that she now has feels contempt towards him. He asks why?  Yesterday, she loved him and now she doesn't.  She looks at the experience of that day of her husband using her to achieve his business deal, he looks at the situation as a way to pay of their debt.  But she sees Prokosch's motivation, Paul does not.  And right before our eyes, we see the disintegration of a marriage.

""Contempt"" is a film that would spotlight the conflict of a director and the producer but also the incompatibility and misunderstandings of a reflective man and an instinctive woman.

VIDEO:

""Contempt"" is presented in 2:35:1 and filmed via cinemascope in full color.  The film would become one of the first films that Godard and cinematographer Raoul Coutard would utilize color in a manner that they have never done before.  And shooting in the beautiful locations of Capri and in Rome, ""Contempt"" is a gorgeous film (which of course would look even better on Blu-ray, side note: the Blu-ray has been released in America by StudioCanal) with colors looking much more vibrant.

It's also important to note that so many people who have seen this film on television, saw it in 4:3 standard format with the sides cut off and thus giving the worst presentation of the film as it was not meant to be.  With this DVD release, viewers saw this film in its original theatrical aspect.

According to the Criterion Collection, the new high-definition digital transfer was created from a 35mm interpositive made from the restored camera negative and was supervised by Beatrice Valbin of StudioCanal and cinematographer Raoul Coutard. To further enhance the image, the MTI Digital Restoration System was used to remove thousands of instances of dirt, debris and scratches.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Contempt"" is presented in monaural French with optional English subtitles.  According to the Criterion Collection, the soundtrack was mastered from a 35mm magnetic track and mastered at 24-bit.  Audio restoration tools were used to reduce clicks, pops, hiss and crackle.

For the most part, the dialogue and music is clear.  I opted to listen to the film with my receiver set to stereo on all channels.  And I absolutely loved the music by Georges Delerue which fit the mood for the film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Contempt"" is the film in which Godard was given the opportunity to nearly work the big budget Hollywood-style film that he had always dreamed of.  Working with one of the most popular woman in the planet, Brigitte Bardot and the talented Michel Piccoli and to work alongside his favorite director Fritz Lang.  It seemed as if ""Contempt"" would be the film that would generate the highest buzz and a dream that would be realized.

The fact is that ""Contempt"" is a popular Godard film especially for cinema fans who are appreciative of Godard oeuvre.  But the film didn't do well in Europe nor did it make money in the box office.  In fact, the film received 50/50 reviews of from film critics who loved it and those who disliked it and found it too pretentious.

Personally, I found ""Contempt"" to be a wonderful and artistic film from Godard in which he was put on the pedestal by producers especially American film and distributor Joseph E. Levine who appears to have probably never watched a Godard film and only known his name through the popularity of the French New Wave.  The fact is that Godard does his films his way and his style and so, ""Contempt"" behind-the-scenes was much more messier than anyone including Godard would ever realize.

Brigitte Bardot was not known for her acting but yet she was the most popular woman in the world.  She was defiant, rebellious and like Godard, did things her way.  And for those familiar with Godard films, his style is not to rehearse and usually keep his talents in the dark by not giving them a script.  But at the time, Bardot was looking for the role to get away from the kitschy films that she had worked previously and wanted to be taken seriously as an actress.  Problem is that she brought an entourage that the filmmaker and the crew had problems dealing with, she also brought paparazzi that Godard never had to deal with and because she was treated so specially, her rule was that she would not film early in the morning which caused problems with scheduling.

As for actor Jack Palance, he came into the film not knowing much about Jean-Luc Godard but knew about the novel that the film was adapted from and was excited about his role until he found out that Godard changed the screenplay which upset Palance and also not used to Godard's style of directing, Palance was infuriated by Godard just telling him what to do and making sure that he didn't do what the director suggested until he received a reason why he was doing what he was being told.  This was not Hollywood as Palance was sure to find out and this added more stress to the filmmaker and the crew.

In fact, Palance told L'Express, ""We never know in advance what we're going to do.  There's almost no dialogue.  It's the worst experience I've ever had! It's madness!"".

But behind-the-scenes, the marriage turmoil between Jean-Luc Godard and wife Anna Karina was taking shape and the screenplay of ""Le Mepris"" (Contempt) was starting to become a film about Jean-Luc Godard and his life with Anna Karina.  As Godard films are known to project the director into his characters, ""Contempt"" was a film in which Michel Piccoli was playing Godard and Bardot was playing Karina.

Piccoli said in an interview with ""Realites"", ""The male character in `Contempt' is Godard.  He wanted me to wear his tie, his hat and his shoes"".  Godard's cinematographer Raoul Coutard even said, ""I am convinced that in `Contempt' he is trying to explain something to his wife.""

In fact, the words that were used in the film were words used by Karina.  The dark wig that Bardot wore in the film was similar to the black wig that Karina wore in ""Vivre sa Vie"" and the exclamation point that ""Contempt"" was a film that embodied Godard and Karina's relationship was Bardot's comment in ""Initiales B.B."" in which she said, ""Godard told me that I had to be filmed with my back to the camera, and to walk away from it, straight ahead.  I rehearsed, and he wasn't happy.  I asked him why.  Because he said, my manner was not the same as Anna Karina's!"".

Needless to say, the harmonious featurette on the DVD by Jacques Rozier showing the happy working relationship between Godard and Bardot was certainly specious.  And to make things even more complicated that after the film was made, the producers were not satisfied as they wanted more nudity, more of Brigitte Bardot's derriere in the film.  After so much arguments and even certain version of the film in which Godard's name was taken off the credits (it's important to note that producer Carlo Ponti was trying to get Francois Truffaut in replacing Godard, especially since Godard was not replying to producer/distributor Levine's telegrams in to making the film more erotic.

So, in essence ""Contempt"" was a not only a film that showed contempt onscreen, behind-the-scenes of the making of the film, there was plenty of it.  This was Godard's test and perhaps his only taste of creating a film with such a high budget (despite most of that budget going towards Bardot, Palance and Lang) and once again, Godard showing that he would buckle to his producers and would create the film that he wanted.  No compromises.

The fact is that ""Contempt"" because of the nature of what went on behind-the-scenes in making this film, is a sore point to Godard and even the producers, especially Levine and both men are in awe of how popular this film is still received by cinema fans of today.  Nearly 50-years since the release of this film in the theaters, the interest in ""Contempt"" has not waned.  More and more people who have discovered Godard's oeuvre have found ""Contempt"" to perfectly show the conflict of a husband and wife and it seems improbable for many people to think that one can have contempt towards a significant other in the manner that is displayed in the film but the fact is, Godard was having these issues in his personal life.

His connection to cinema is his passion, as the character of Paul.  His life is embodied in cinema but their significant others are not.  And for ""Contempt"", the film deviates from the novel as the premise of the screenwriter working on the film ""Odyssey"" has now been changed.  In ""Contempt"", Paul is the rewriter of the film that is being shot by Fritz Lang.  In the novel, the director uses ""Odyssey"" to showcase the deterioration of the couple but not in ""Contempt"".  The dictator-ish American producer is the one wanting to make ""Contempt"" commercially viable.  As Godard was using Paul and Camille as characters based on him and Karina, was Prokosch his way of giving the middle finger to American producer/distributor Joseph E. Levine?  Quite possibly.

And that is what I enjoyed about ""Contempt"" and Godard's filmmaking.  Although for ""Contempt"", the film was a compromise as Godard was literally pushed into the corner by the producers and had to compromise in trying to bring those erotic images of Bardot to the screen although not the way Levine had wanted it, but this was Godard's recognition that the years of the Hollywood film that he once watched and the artistic freedom that director's once had was no more.  The dream that he had always wanted to become part of as a fan of cinema was fully learned by the director that his entry to a big budget film in which have artistic freedom wasn't going to happen.

But for those of us who watch this film and knowing what Godard was able to accomplish, especially with three angry producers and the talent he had been given, we can only judge what we see onscreen.  For Godard-ites, we recognize the pain and the breakdown of the relationship of Godard and Karina, like we recognize Godard dying at the hands of Karina twice in the film ""Made in U.S.A."".  I found this film to be visual poetry and a highlight in Godard's career.

The DVD comes with plenty of special features and a wonderful commentary by film scholar Robert Stam and I know that there is a Blu-ray release by StudioCanal out in the market today and this Criterion Collection DVD edition is now out of print.  I have not personally watched the Blu-ray version of ""Contempt"" yet, so I can't comment on how it compares to the DVD version in picture quality (which is a given that that the Blu-ray will be better in PQ and AQ).

But overall, ""Le Mepris"" (Contempt) is a film worthy of having in your cinema collection.  If you are a fan of Godard films, personally, this is a must-own film.  A wonderful DVD release from the Criterion Collection and is a release that I definitely recommend!",1276560000,6,15449,4.774387947269303
1451130,4,B00005JKPT,"""Contempt""(1963) is directed by Jean-Luc Godard. The film is interesting in that it encircles a given second in time when Camille Javal (Brigette Bardot) looses her love for Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli),  unlike most films that would follow a linear progression from love to contempt. When Paul realizes his error it is too late and from then on he is constantly seen out of sync with Camille.

As with many of Godard's films this one is also about a film within a film, or a film about film. Fritz Lang (Metropolis, M) acts the part of a director late in his life who is forced to compromise himself to commercial film in order to make a living. Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance) is the American producer who is only concerned with making money and showing off his female actors assets just as Godard was asked by his producers with respect to Bardot. The movie Fritz Lang is making is an adaptation of Homer's Odyssey that Paul is hired to rework so as to make it more commercially viable. The classical characters of Penelope, Odysseus and Poseidon parallel Camille, Paul, and Jeremy. Paul seems to understand and relate his predicament with Camille to Penelope interpreting that Camille has lost her love for him because she believes that he has tried to leave her, just as Odysseus left Penelope for many years to journey the world because he was possibly trying to avoid her. Whether this is true or not, Paul only half heartedly tries to regain her love for him which only serves to further widen the rift between them. Camille never really comes out and says why she has lost her love for him and we are left trying to put the pieces together wondering if this is merely a lover's game or not. There is a curious balance between Paul's interest in her, and his indifference to her, that inevitably seems to push her away from him. Maybe she is just too young for him, or he is not stimulated intellectually by her, we don't know, but she is instinctively repelled by this indifference which crystalized at that moment, that second, when Paul seemed to push Camille to ride alone with Jeremy on the short  drive to his house.

This is the French release of the film which is multilingual with English subtitles, as opposed to the American or Italian releases which were dubbed. This is also the full 103 minute version, whereas the Italian version was cut down to 82 minutes. The restored print looks very good overall with only a few blemishes. The blu-ray disc is in 1080p with CinemaScope 2.35:1. The DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 may sound a bit brash to some ears but this is evidently how the film has always sounded, and I merely had the volume adjusted down a bit from where I normally watch a film. There are many special features, such as an introduction by Colin MacCabe, and a couple of documentaries about the film: ""Once Upon a Time There Was...Contempt"", and ""Contempt...Tenderly"". There is also a conversation with Fritz Lang, and in ""The Dinosaur and the Baby"" a discussion between Fritz Lang, and Jean-Luc Godard, as well as a booklet with an essay by Ginette Vincendeau.",1270425600,8,3086,4.656880733944954

1451135,3,B00005JKPT,"Of the films I've seen so far of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, his best is 1963's Contempt (Les Mpris), adapted by Godard from Alberto Moravia's novel Il Disprezzo, published in English as The Ghost At Noon. That statement should not be taken as an acknowledgment of greatness, for although this is his best film, it is not close to being a great film for, despite a gorgeous aping of the Michelangelo Antonioni style of shooting widescreen landscapes and affinity for formal structures, the film lacks any of the metaphysical heft and narrative thrust that propel the best of Antonioni's work, such as La Notte or Blowup. If Antonioni were more pretentious and less a wellspring of ideas, he would have made Contempt. That said, it's not a bad film, and it does exert an odd power over the viewer, above and beyond the nude ogling of a sexy, young, and ineffably feline Brigitte Bardot.... While clearly influenced by Antonioni's L'Avventura- although shot in color, especially in the scenes at Capri, at the famous Malaparte Villa, replete with wedge shaped brick and stone stairs and crags that rise from the sea, cinematographer Raoul Coutard displays that he actually had talent, unlike some of the earlier, visually sloppier films of Godard. The red, yellow, white, and blue palette Technicolor scheme also is effectively evoked to give the film a look that is more modern than many contemporary films, as well as being more modern and mature in the screenplay and attitudes- despite its flaws. Coutard also makes great use of the Cinemascope wide shots- called Francescope in this production, as characters are constantly and interestingly framed at the edged of the screen. Another plus is the use of flashbacks and flashforwards as voiceovers rove, for this effectively demonstrates the faronzaled attitudes of the characters. A big negative, however, is the Georges Delerue score. The main theme herks and jerks into inappropriate scenes, and often adds a melodramatic touch that is almost laughable. It also rises up and cuts off without warning, or any relation to the onscreen goings on, and each instance of its use progressively weakens its impact. In the commentary, Stam claims that the music is used as punctuation on dramatic and/or important moments, but this is simply not so. It is undisciplined and poorly applied. To say the least, Godard was no Werner Herzog with soundtracks.
  This sort of artistic anomy- along with that in other aspects of the film, may make many vapid critics masturbate, but great art is not the child that such bears. Too much is left open ended in the film, and that which is resolved simply is not that fascinating, since the viewer is never given enough to care about the characters. In this sense, Godard shares as much `contempt' for his viewers as many of the bad Hollywood films, and the material machinations that produce them, this film seems to criticize. Still, it is his most successful film at connecting with an audience, more so than that other reflexive 1963 opus on filmmaking, Federico Fellini's 8; although Contempt is not as good a film. Nor is it as nearly as cogent a comment on marriage as either Antonioni's La Notte nor Ingmar Bergman's Scenes From A Marriage. The thirty minute interlude, especially, pales in comparison to Bergman's crackling and realistic, if intelligentsia-laden, repartee.
  One wonders what might have occurred had Godard done more big budget films, for the rigor of having to meet some others' expectations disciplined him, and toned down his most masturbatory tendencies. Unfortunately, he never again went so mainstream, a thing which is often a pox on an artist- think about all the Hollywood films of the last thirty years, or that Chick Lit that you are reading, but which occasionally can help a `fringe' artist, with delusions of grandeur and an empty philosophy, mediate into excellence. Without it, Godard is simply Godard, and Contempt a beautiful film that is lifeless and flaccid, where nothing happens. It is populated by mannekins which have no lives of their own. This makes for a pretty window display, but gets old quickly after you've taken it all in.",1221004800,13,4179,4.991391678622668
1451136,3,B00005JKPT,"I'm always interested in seeing films with a strong reputation.  I had seen a previous movie by Godard (""Breathless"") which left me underwhelmed but I decided to try again.  I had a rough idea of the plot of ""Contempt"" and I was interested that Jack Palance was in a starring role.  I was confused by the artistic painting that is shown with the film's title.  It looked to me like the face of Christ on the Cross.  Seeing it on a large screen, I realized that it was just the opposite.

What is the purpose of ""Contempt""?  From reviews I have glanced through, this movie is Godard's expression of his opinion of Hollywood films (and the one-word title of the film is a more succinct expression of the same).  I guess the abusive, mindless, domination of the character of the producer (played by Palance) was the key to this expression of distaste.  However, while I can appreciate the sentiment, I felt Godard showed his own shortcomings by portraying the producer so stereotypically.  With a man of Palance's talent, a more in-depth portrayal would, in my opinion, enhance the point rather than trivialize it.  The footage we get from the film-within-a-film is certainly one I wouldn't care to see.  That may have been the point but why?  I was looking forward to seeing Fritz Lang but that was anticlimatical as well.  The one aspect of ""Contempt"" that I found compelling was the breakdown of the marriage of the characters played by Bridgette Bardot and Michel Piccoli.  That part drew me in and, while I could only guess at the reasoning behind the breakup, I certainly was able to sense the inbalance of their relationship.  I suppose that this was a statement that Hollywood films convey a lot of shallow emotion.  Granted.  However, I prefer to get more in return for giving such a film my own emotional involvement.  I have seen references to films that reviewers cite as movies that need to be seen at least several times before they can truly be appreciated.  The irony of ""Contempt"" is that it left me with no interest in watching it again unlike the Hollywood productions that I do watch repeatedly.  Some would say that statement was a comment on me.  I say it is a comment on Godard.",1211673600,5,2198,4.639896373056994
1451137,4,B00005JKPT,"The movie is of course very complex and a work of art.  Now mi little comment written on a day I was on a rage: Some say that this film is about the gradual destruction of a marriage by the husband's insecurities and the contempt this awakens in a simple woman.  I see it as the rationalization a beautiful woman does to justify her going after a hunky distasteful rich man.  If she is angry with her husband, it seems to be because he put him in a situation where she must choose between power and faithfulness.  Of course, she chooses the former.  I was very happy to see that her choice ends tragically. (According to the article included in the Criterion edition, others say that Godard was in favor of Camille, but I don't know how this is possible given what we see on screen).",1189987200,,783,4.335616438356165
1451138,5,B00005JKPT,"In the hands of New Wave master Godard, this brilliant, piercing film about alienation and the end of a marriage is also quite overtly about the cinema itself--especially the role of art in relation to commercial interests. Casting sex kitten Bardot as Camille is particularly inspired, as anyone will understand how a sudden loss of her affections would drive a man insane. As a slick, boorish Hollywood type, Palance is wonderfully reptilian, but Lang has all the best lines, effectively ventriloquizing Godard's own views. Lovingly shot in Rome and Capri in dazzling CinemaScope, ""Contempt"" is subversive food for thought.",1182902400,3,625,5.3232323232323235
1451139,4,B00005JKPT,"Strangely enough, director Jean-Luc Godard understood Bardot's capabilities best, and with ""Le Mpris,"" he succeeded where Malle had failed... Because the movie reflected Bardot's new life, the viewer was shown the woman, the actress, the public image, and the private life... ""B.B."" was dead; Brigitte Bardot was alive and well...

Of all the movies about movies ""Le Mpris"" may be the most penetrating, the most alienated and least entertaining... Not many people have seen ""Le Mpris,"" but of those who have many despise it greatly...

""Le Mpris"" is one of the few films that actually encourages its audiences to walk out... Aside from the fact that it has something important to say and says it interestingly, ""Le Mpris"" is a nadir of entertainment, and for this reason, and because it is one of the most alienated and alienating films ever made, one can choose to call it great too...

In his film debut, Michel Piccoli (Paul Juval) is a failed playwright who wants to write for the stage, but his sexy wife, Camille (Brigitte Bardot), requests a middle-class style of life... Paul has used his savings to buy her an apartment in a stylish building in Rome and is now financially enslaved... The American film producer and tycoon, Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance), has offered him a job as screenwriter of 'The Odyssey,' to be directed by then veteran German-American filmmaker Fritz Lang (played by Fritz Lang!).

Paul sells out, signs the contract with Prokosch and earns the never ending contempt of his wife, who drifts into a liaison with Jerry--not so clear anyway...

Obviously, Prokosch is the Great Vulgarian Producer... He wants Lang to direct 'The Odyssey' because ""a German, Schliemann, discovered Troy."" Prokosch buys and sells mens' souls... He rushes around the film studio in a flashy red sports car, and reads stupid and pretentious maxims from a red book he carries in his breast pocket...

The story of the dissolution of the Javals' marriage and Camille's contempt for Paul is entwined with the legend of Ulysses, and also with a sort of documentary look at what it's like to make a movie: the compromises, the idiocy, the boredom, and the fatigue...

There are references to film and film-making throughout the motion picture: posters on walls for Howard Hawks' ""Hatari"" and Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" brief looks at the inside of a movie studio, and the goings-on in a screening room... But perhaps the most interesting and mystical element in this film are its first and final shots...

On Godard's instructions we are compelled to point inwards, to submit, to think, and to contemplate... Godard seems to suggest that the provocative statement of ""Le Mpris"" which is sombre, beautiful and rich, is in reality a short interesting anecdote about us all...",1168128000,,2772,5.010869565217392

moments of self-doubt from bedroom to soundstage with the nubile

Brigitte Bardot. If I give you $30,000 in 1963 money, may I sleep with

your wife? Godard invents yet another, now standard film idea, the

moral curmudgeon: is my significant other a commodity.

Jack Palance leers over Brigitte and certainly, he has enough Hollywood

bucks to install her in his bedroom. In fact, he has enough bucks to

turn a work of art into a mass produced clich&eacute;. Skin sells in Peoria.

Palance is printing dollars as he screens films for rubes, but what of

true artists as say, Fritz Lang, the director that made the silent

classic M. Lang works around Palance's interference. He must finish

Louis Mayer.

every opportunity to look at her, sharing with the voyeurs. The star

I still fast-forwarded some of the scenes, but lingered longer on some of the others. It seems to me that Godard oozes contempt for everything and everyone involved with this picture, including the picture itself, except, possibly, Fritz Lang. Lang is too old and too wise to be an object of Godard's scorn. Godard appears to me to despise Hollywood, Hollywood producers, Hollywood films, his own producer, nude starlets, the film industry, Cinemascope, remakes of classic texts, mercenary writers, melodramatic cop-out endings, movie audiences, weak husbands and, especially, the type of wife who wants to have her cake and eat it. He also seems to feel contempt for himself --- but perhaps I'm reading too much into it all: the whole thing is perverse. I think his feeling towards the actors may be neutral, for want of a better word. At least, they seem to be giving him what he wants. Bardot gives a fine performance, imho, and so do the others: always supposing Palance is meant to be as wooden as he appears. The analysis of womanly logic in the apartment dialogue is deeply misogynistic, but also extremely accurate. I will give this film a third go, and watch it patiently all the way through, as I suspect it will reveal more as time goes by. But it is a sour piece of work, and I doubt whether I would upgrade it to 5 stars, although I've given 5 to worse films. It is thought-provoking, but the thoughts it provokes are not welcome. Nor do they seem to me worthwhile. The shots of the Greek statues are great.",1142640000,11,1658,4.681506849315069
1451203,5,B00005JKPT,"If you expect one thing from cinema, and one thing alone, then this film will disappoint.  Godard challenges the limitations of cinema in aspiring to render ideas normally reserved for print or, at a stretch, the stage onto the screen.  Here he dares to present Michel Piccoli as a modern day Ulysses - so Godard expects the audience to engage with his work much like a reader might with a work of discursive philosophy, or a satiric play, or with James Joyce.  Yet the work itself is paradigmatically cinematic, with absolutely stunning cinematography and carefully considered use of sound.
*
As with literary forms throughout the twentieth century, Contempt is overtly self-reflexive.  It also delights in references to its influences, which are many, prime being icons of cinema history.  Fritz Lang, of course, is a character in the film - his presence is authoratative, immediately raising questions as to the status of any of his lines - is it Lang himself speaking, or is he simply 'acting', recounting Godard's lines.  Of further interest in this Criterion edition is an interview between Godard and Lang from 1967 - their interaction is as charming as it is revealing - above all, their mutual passion for film is evident, as is their vexed, but by no means simplistic, relationship with film's role as entertainment or 'divertissement'.
*
The broad satire of Hollywood, as embodied in the stylized persona of Jack Palance, is one concern of the film.  This refers back to the issue of entertainment, and the question of for whom is the film made.  Thus we have Palance at one point replying to Lang and Piccoli, ""Whenever I hear the word culture I bring out my cheque book.""  He goes on to write the cheque using his attractive female assistant as a table - make what you will of what this suggests of Hollywood's attitude to women and to its Faustian control of money.
*
Bardot's presence is just as conscious as that of Lang.  Is she a modern day icon comparable to the women who influenced the events of Greek epics?  Quite possibly.  The story of the Odyssey might best be encapsulated by a quote from Lang in the film itself, pointedly directed against Palance - ""It's a fight of the individual against the circumstances - the eternal problem of the old Greeks.  I don't know if you are able to  understand it Jerry, I certainly hope you can, it's a fight against the gods.""

I'm a fan of WKW, but I haven't even seen a Godard film... the source of inspiration not only for WKW but for many designers out there in the world. His work, especially this movie, is heavily referenced in many books and journals... and yet, I haven't seen it... until now that is. Contempt was filmed in Franscope format, which at the time was very cutting edge, and grandiose... very special and very widescreen... with an all star cast...Bridgitte Bardot, Jack Palance, and Fritz Lang playing himself. The subject here is Homer's Odyssey (which makes sense for the choice of Franscope as the medium)...but while some scenes DO in fact take place in ruins like Rome's inconsequential stage version of itself, Cinecitta... as well as scenes in temples... I mean the famous Villa Malaparte... most of the movie takes place ""inside""... inside living rooms, inside bathrooms, inside the bedroom... on the surfaces of rugs, sofas, tables, chairs, on the surface of skin, Bardot's skin that is. All filmed in widescreen in all it's glory. But there is nothing to film. There is struggle, but not anything ""epic"" that we are used to see as filmgoers, as befitting to see for widescreen viewing. Okay this review is going tooo long... but so did the movie. WKW film a lot... I MEAN ALOT... about nothing... but they were great movies... with so much substance... so much struggle, with themes sooo epic and rotund, that one can return to the same movie in different times of their lives and pick up something new. While Contempt does not necessarily do that... it does call into question the role of the director, the story, the medium, the actor, the character, the audience, and the epic. All these relationships are assessed and re-assessed all the time throughout the film. If you're comfortable with the density of it all, then it's fine... but sometimes we just want to be the audience, because that's easy... that's safe... and that's comfortable. WKW separates us from them, but enables us to feel as if we were them... Godard offers no such separation, no release, and no grand ending (as is the case with this movie). We don't even feel anything for Godard, for the film, and for them... nor do we feel anything different about us after this epic journey is through.

Similar in style to Antonioni's film trilogy of the 60s that started with L'Avventura (1960), Contempt beautifully tells the story of a marriage lost, and a journey fullfilled. The film takes place over a short period of time, and half of it is contained in the couple's apartment, yet the film has an epic feel as large as The Odyssey. Raoul Coutard's cinematography is nothing short of magnificant, Georges Delerue's score is one of the most haunting and exquisite in cinema, and the acting, especially by Bardot in a sublte performance, is top notch. Godard may not have embraced the CinemaScope look, but this film is evidence he knew how to use it. Contempt works on three levels: First as a breakdown of a marriage, second as a modern day re-telling of The Odyssey, and third as a stand in for the makers of the film; but either way you look at it Contempt is a beautiful, somewhat surreal masterpiece that stands with the best of cinema.",1128729600,4,1101,4.680412371134021
1451206,5,B00005JKPT,"Camille: ""Then you love me totally.""

Paul: ""I love you totally, tenderly, tragically.""

Such is the story of Camille and Paul, whose lives we watch slowly unravel in tender tragedy. This is a movie to be watched and to be felt; to be understood by the part of you that has struggled to change an unchangeable love or the part of you that has felt the urge to desecrate your own life simply out of restless need to feel something new or understand something raw.

To begin with, Godard takes insoluble feelings of love/hate/restlessness/desire/contempt and weaves it under a thin layer of lives, which as you watch, cannot be seen directly but is clearly felt. He foregoes standard cinematic technique/storytelling criteria as he drops changing color filters over Bardot's introductory nude scene and compares the raging emotions of man against the widescapes of the still ocean and skies (as is seen in particularly breathtaking shots rotating around Greek statues with eyes painted in bright red against a backdrop of bluish white skies and a tortuous finale to which Godard himself yells ""Silence!"" and cuts to the motionless sea).

On top of this, the musical score done by Georges Delerue has been called the most beautiful score ever heard. It is repeated throughout the movie and it comes and goes unpredictably, like the asthmatic attacks that life often unveils at times not necessarily warranted.

The ancient gods, Ulisses was guided by fate, this was Homers presentation of the Greeks conception about life, when Greece was far by any comprehension, home to the most civilized society of mankind.

Today there is no god, today man IS god, today man lives off contempt. Something was broken and can never be restored. We lost fate, we lost god, we lost love. Today woman is goddess, beautiful as fragile. Men are gods, weak as true to their beliefs.
Godard poetically frees himself from his sedimented frustration towards the systematic approach of the nonsense, the invisible that purely resided in the beauty of the visible. Ancient tragedy is today's life.
Godard makes movies, and the derelict studios of Rome's Cinecitt' where films (art - still full of contradictions) are made, may be our only way to fill the place of the lost gods, but what Godard is saying is that this is never going to happen. This can happen only in art, only in movies, in literature, in music, and again Godard makes movies: we are what movies are made from. Art is our only hope, it's our only journey to discover the invisible meaning of life, and in Contempt it does end with the infinity of the seas.

 It's a little slow, but the biggest problem is that the movie doesn't really like itself. It's in widescreen, but one of the characters says ""[Cinemascope] wasn't meant for human beings. Just for snakes... and funerals. "" Why did Godard do a big studio picture? It seems like he just resents it.

 One of the biggest pleasures is seeing Fritz Lang playing himself. And Brigitte Bardot is beautiful as alway. But if you've just been hearing about Godard and want to see one of his movies, don't see this first- I'd go for ""A Band of Outsiders"", which I think is his best. If you've seen lots of his films already and want more, then you should see this. Just don't expect another masterpiece.",1090454400,4,902,4.448484848484848
1451209,1,B00005JKPT,"Regarded by some as Godard's most accessible movie, I beg to differ:  Godard has survived because of the freshness and charm of his best films, not as most fawning critics would have you believe because of their intellectual content or ground-breaking film making.  As far as intellect goes, the most you hope for with Godard is a ten-minute Maoist harangue interesting now only for showing the then-zeitgeist.  As for brilliant, ground-breaking film-making, the same applies - plenty of student films have adopted the same techniques as Godard just to save money or out of pure innocence.  If you want groundbreaking, you want Kurosawa or Tarkovsky or Von Trier.  What is great about Godard are scenes like the improvised caf dance in Bande a Part or the crazy ""murder"" sequences in Pierrot, scenes which are outrageously witty and cool and original but actually quite simple, like the Beatles singing ""I am the Walrus, woooooh.""
Back to the point:  Unlike his Pierrot, Bande a Part or Une Femme est une Femme in particular, this film seriously lacks charm.  The whole thing has a sour mood about it, the actors really look like they have no idea what they are up to and just want it to be over - Palance above all, forced to play a madly egotistical meglomaniac film producer with lines that would look second-rate in a primary school pantomime.  Bardot and Piccoli get through it, but you can sense the tension.  Lang looks like he's on Valium.  No doubt realising that his film was getting a bit irritating as it labours away with tiresome lack of subtlety at a domestic rupture (see same in Femme est une Femme for how it can be done, but this time con brio), Godard goes for broke by repeatedly introducing the mawkish background music all over the place (you can almost see him with an adolescent smirk on his face as he lays it on) to the point of making you groan.
Another thing I frankly don't understand is this:  virtually any crit you read will tell you how this was Godard's first and last flirtation with big-budget movie-making.  Big budget?  It's about the cheapest movie I've ever seen.  For example:  any producer worth his salt would be surrounded with an entourage and chauffeurs.  This guy can barely run to one secretary and drives himself around in a medium-budget Alfa.  Likewise Lang.  At the Villa Malaparte, a spectacular site on Capri, we see some scenes with a reception being laid out in the back.  Look carefully:  the ""caterers"" consist of one old man fumbling around with some plates.  The paint is peeling off the walls in the living room.  The entire film crew working on the film-within-the-film seems to consist of about three people, and they're not even around most of the time.  Best of all, look carefully at the car crash in the final reel.  Apparently they couldn't even afford to total the Alfa, so it's a mock up.
Art films are tricky things: the best of them can change your life and lift you to inspiration and wonder.  The worst are not worth the celluloid they're made on.  But to read all the critics, you sometimes have a hell of a job deciding which is which.  Take it from me, this one belongs in the poubelle.",1084492800,18,3164,4.654054054054054
1451210,5,B00005JKPT,"I prefer this film to Fellini's 8 1/2 and there are some similarities.  They were made at the same time and they were the first two post-modern films.  In this one B.B. is given some good nude scenes we male fans crave in the context of a top notch 1963 work of art.  Fritz Lang plays himself and when he mentions B.B. he's talking about Bertolt Brecht, not Brigitte Bardot who doesn't play herself (one of many in jokes).  What I love here is the 1960s feel of the film, the melancholy soundtrack which is supposed to express B.B.s emotions, and masterful cinematography.  The scenes are set up perfectly and in one we see B.B. in one room talking to Michel Piccoli in another...in the same shot.
  There is a modern feel to the film made in color set in Capri, and a feeling of freedom.  The plot is that B.B. feels ""contempt"" for her husband because he lets Jack Palance come on to her, and it works with brilliant subtlety.  The ending is kind of another in joke, as there's a bit of dialogue by Lang ""death is not a resolution"".  In one scene the stars are all interacting against a background of current movie posters (""Psycho"" among them).  And Palance needs a translator from English to French, German, and Italian in the way of the beautiful Giorgia Moll.  Lang speaks German, and everyone else Italian, a smorgasborg of languages.
  Some later Godard films don't really work well as they are too disjointed (Weekend, 2 or 3 Things...), but here it all comes together.",1072224000,10,1477,4.524528301886792

Her body gets a lot of attention and there are plenty of shots of her lying in the sun naked but she gives her character depth. Strangley enough when she walks around wearing a black wig she looks very plain, not at all like a movie star. Perhaps the most striking thing about this film is that though it was Godards first color film he manages to use color brilliantly. The film was shot in Italy and reminds me of a Michelangelo Antonioni film as it is a story of two lovers who fail to communicate and thus let their love slip away.
Jack Palance is perfect as the headstrong producer who manipulates his director Fritz Lang (who plays himself),  as well as his writer (Michel Piccoli). Palance is the ultimate megalomaniacal producer who enjoys dominating others and manipulating them into doing whatever he wants. The confident and poised Lang acts like the master that he is, he never loses his cool and he copes with Palance's outrageous tantrums as if they were nothing at all, and we can see that despite Palance's constant intereference Lang will make the film that he wants. But the young, sensitive writer is made to feel like a whore. And this explains why he begins to treat his wife like a whore. Piccoli does not seem to want to admit what he is doing but  he seems to push his wife into the arms of Palance intentionally so she too will feel the way he does.  The script is based on an Alberto Moravia novel and this is a classic Moravia scenario.  Moravia was fascinated with prostitutes and so was Godard -- ie My Life to Live.
The husband and wife both feel like whores and so they feel contempt for themselves as well as each other. The husband wonders aloud why commerce must invade every aspect of our lives and by that he means both art and love but he seems powerless to win his wife back. Though the film began with the loving couple laying in bed and whispering to each other, it ends on quite a different note.  Palance, Lang, and Piccoli all interpret Homers Odyssey in their own way. Each views the relationship between Odysseus and Penelope according to their own life situation. Palance and Piccoli cease to find the film all that interesting, they are only interested in the battle for Bardot.  Lang alone remains focused on the actual film. For Lang the world of the Greeks is too far removed from our own experince of the world and so he reinvents the story so it will resonate with modern audiences and he does so by brilliantly quoting from select texts (Dante, Holderlein)and thus he tells the tale as if it were taking place in the world we know today--as Lang reimagines the tale each scene takes on new significance.  And of course the way Lang thinks and works sounds a lot like the way Godard thinks and works.
An excellent film which can be appreciated by Godard fans and a good place to start for those not familiar with Godard.",1071360000,10,2926,4.499058380414312
1451212,5,B00005JKPT,"What a great movie that is and i saw it 20 times. This is a great transfer with the original movie opening (credits) for me this is the perfect movie ever made, Brigitte Bardot is rather gorgeous and plays Camille in a very passive way, the movie is full of rich colourRed Blue and White, a very intelligent movie and i like the movie inside the movie, A great Cast too Michel Piccoli playing Brigitte husband, Fritz lanf playing himself as the great Film director and Jack Palance playing the american producer . The movie was shot in Capri and the music is simply
haunting. For me this is the perfect movie, and it feeds all my senses, great photography by Raoul Coutard, stunning Location and a very stunning Brigitte Bardot who can prove that she was rather a good actress. THE EXTRAS ARE AMAZING TOO, A VERY RARE DOCUMENTARY MADE ABOUT BB ""PAPARAZZI"" SHOWING A PURSUED Brigitte. and a couple of interesting interviews of Fritz Lang and Jean Luc Goddard. IF YOU MUST BUY A GODDARD MOVIE THIS IS THE ONE TO ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION. SIMPLY INTELLIGENT AND THE OPENING SCENE Of BB AND Piccoli (when she asked him if she likes her body and ...) is a very arty nude scene added by goddard to please the american producer. One of BB BEST MOVIE ALONG WITH THE TRUTH (Made by Clouzot).I LOVE IT !!!",1066780800,10,1293,4.459915611814346
1451213,1,B00005JKPT,"If Jean-Luc Godard hated commercial film producers, why did he make a movie for them?  To make some adolescent point about how he, The Brave Artist, would never be cowed by the vulgar likes of Carlo Ponti or Joseph Levine, I suppose.  And to prove that he could get  Brigitte Bardot as naked, or naked-er, than her ex-husband Roger Vadim.
Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.  And what to we get?  About 90 minutes of mind-numbing agony as Godard plays film-school in-jokes and stretches scenes out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.  But none of this adds up to real drama, either.  As a result, any honest audience will have to admit that they've been cheated, too.  And unlike Joe Levine, none of US owned the screen rights to THE CARPETBAGGERS . . .",1062806400,9,1042,4.6502732240437155
1451214,4,B00005JKPT,"This was a good film. It's slow-moving by today's standards and I doubt many younger filmgoers would have the patience to sit through many of its lengthy sequences, where admittedly, little ""happens"" on screen. That's Godard's style and what gives his movies their unique approach. That's the charm and this film's full of it. The conversations and communications between the characters in this film seem so believable and ""genuine"" that it's hard to immagine this is performance by actors reading a script. It seems too improvised and natural and ""documentary"" in style, that you could almost accuse Jean Luc Godard of making ""fake"" reality TV years before its time. (It's much better than reality TV however in that Godard's characters are far more exotic and interesting).
This DVD is presented in a tight 2.85:1 widescreen ratio from Cinemascope film in full color. The colors are vibrant and Godard makes excellent use of the panoramic widecsreen composition in all his shots. It's a visual treat throughout. The audio commentary is insightful and will enrich your appreciation of the film. Bardot's performance is stunning. My favorite aspect was in seeing Fritz Lang play himself. He must've been a very fascinating and brilliant man.",1056931200,,1241,5.17910447761194
1451215,5,B00005JKPT,"did you know that the opening of this film by goddard was not in his original script? yes, the opening segment with the nude bardot and piccoli was added on after post-production because the studio threatened to shelve the entire film. the studio was outraged that goddard had 'misused' bardot by not showing any nude scenes. goddard compromised by having bardot shot nude in the opening segment, with piccoli reciting a farcical monologue focusing on the studio's obssession with bardot's naked features.",1056412800,8,505,5.170731707317073
1451216,5,B00005JKPT,"Jean-Luc Godard's Contempt is abstract at times, analystic at most, and full of the contemptuous vibes that deliver the film its title, and, indeed, consistently interesting entry in the Godard catalog of work.  It examines a lead character in a bit of a sense like how Fellini examined a lead in 8 1/2, except that while in that he toyed and illuminated his fantasies about his struggles in filmmaking process, Godard slums in it, though with a carefully tuned attitude and style. He knows he's making an ""art"" film as much as he's making a ""commercial"" film, and that adds to its appeal. Like a good number of his films it's off putting at times, but the way the characters look into the film within the film, in this case the Odyssey, as well as they essentially do for this one, Goddard has made a fascinating hybrid on the workings of Hollywood.
His lead is played by Michael Piccoli, who like Fellini's Mastorianni is the torn screenwriter, torn in this case in three directions- one by a commercial producer (Jack Palance) who wants the production to be epic but has many reservations about the craft; another by a legendary director (all the more so since Lang is playing himself) who is only interested in the art of it, like when he views slides and shots of old Greek statues and such, and Palance chucks the film around the room; the last by his wife, played by the beautiful (if slightly depressing) Bridget Bardot who has as many or more inner demons as her husband.  Their conversation, which lasts a longish if hypnotic half an hour, gives Bardot her spotlight in the picture.
Like an Odyssey of sorts the film becomes, lending itself to Godard's focus on the aspect of the idea of characters breaking down, and how the atmosphere he creates is one that can understandably make anyone crack. Contempt isn't a milestone for the filmmaker, but it's watchable as a second or third film to introduce the common viewer to Godard, and for film buffs it provides a wide, captivating glimpse of the film world for film buffs.",1056240000,3,2033,4.66016713091922

1451218,5,B00005JKPT,"The Italian writer Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli) is hired to write a screenplay about Homer's Odyssey which will be directed by the German director Fritz Lang (himself) and produced by the American producer Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance).  Jeremy begins to flirt openly with Paul's wife, Camille (Brigitte Bardot), and ends up asking if the couple wants to visit his place for drinks.  Jeremy also asks Camille if she wants to go with him in the car to his place.  Unfortunately, there is only room for two individuals in his red Alpha Romeo.  Camille is hesitant, but Paul encourages her to go with Jeremy.  Paul gets delayed on his way to Jeremy's place and when he arrives he finds himself being met by Camille with some resistance.  When the couple goes home to their newly acquired apartment, a discussion begins where Camille's resistance ends up with open contempt for Paul.  Contempt is an analysis of human relationships where trust, communication, and care is in the focus through the lens of Jean-Luc Godard.  The film provides a sublime opportunity for the audience to view the actions and consequences of a variety of individuals and see how these individuals converge intellectually and emotionally in the project on which they work.  The result of the screening is a brilliant experience that provides chance for pondering and reflection over the characters' actions as well as the directing and cinematography.",1048377600,16,1424,5.051282051282051
1451219,4,B00005JKPT,"With his subversively titled Le Mepris or CONTEMPT from 1964, Jean-Luc Godard played Hollywood widescreen games while dissing Hollywood itself. Godard undermines the epic Franscope scale with an intimate look at an arrogant producer's attempt to make a modern version of Homer's Odyssey.
Jack Palance is terrific as the combative producer and the great Fritz Lang essentially plays himself as the vetaran director of the film within the film. In a serious but still sex-pot turn, Brigitte Bardot is the pouty director's wife who's fed up with their termagant relationship. And at the center of the conflict is the screenwriter who's trying to please everyone.
This extremely entertaining film with lots of in-jokes about movies is Godard's take on fame, art, and love itself.
The loaded two disc set features a pristine transfer with a wonderful commentary by Robert Stam. Bonus material includes a conversation between Godard and Lang; two 1963 documentaries -- Godard and Bardot on the set of Contempt and Paparazzi. A 1964 Godard interview and a new video interview with acclaimed cinematographer Raoul Coutard.",1043884800,8,1114,5.299435028248587

7939273,1,B00005JKPT,"Incredibly dull film that makes ""Breathless"" look positively zippy in pacing, which it is not. If you remember the approximately 28-minute bedroom scene in Breathless, you will get much more dull bed talk scenes here. Almost certain this movie's high ratings merely come from people gawking at Bardot's exposed rear, which occurs quite frequently in this film for the lack of anything else of interest. Bardot does show depth, but such frequent displays of her body (her face is not focused on very much) detract from that purpose. The male protagonist is highly unpleasant in a totally unamusing and irredeemable way (You wonder how a loser like him got Camille (Bardot) and there is only one song in the entire soundtrack. It plays so often that it loses its meaning, just like many of the motifs in this movie. This movie rides on parasitically using symbols from Homer's Odyssey to trick you into thinking there's deeper meaning in them. Moreover, its evaluation of Homer's Odyssey is inaccurate Slight possible spoiler alert: They say that perhaps Odysseus wanted to go to the Trojan War to leave Penelope. If you know the Odyssey at all, you'd know that Odysseus feigned madness to avoid being chosen to be in the Trojan War, constantly ploughing fields until his son Telemachus was put in front of him, at which he suddenly swerved away and his sanity was revealed. This overlooked, basic background fact about the Odyssey makes the whole underlying premise of the film bunk. If you want to watch a good Godard film, watch the brilliant and uninhibited ""Pierrot Le Fou."" That actually works on every level. There were probably only 3 points of interest, 2 of them inconsequential, in this overlong film.",1475884800,3,1710,4.920415224913495
