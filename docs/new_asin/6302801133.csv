514382,5,6302801133,"Filmed in 1950, this film is brilliantly directed by Nicholas Ray.  Its production company, Santana Productions, was Bogart's own (Santana was the name of his yawl), which he started in 1948 and sold to Columbia Pictures in 1954, the problem being that his company simply couldn't outbid the large studios for properties he wanted, i.e., Dead End and The Detective Story (some of Santana's films included Knock on Any Door, Tokyo Joe and Sirocco, which Bogart himself called ""a stinker"").
Eric Lax, the definitive biographer of Humphrey Bogart, believes that he was drawn to this role because he could so closely identify with the character's inner turmoil, problems with women, and a rocky relationship with the ups and downs of the film industry itself.  The character he plays is also a heavy drinker.  Perhaps because of the similarities, and because Bogart was so greatly talented, his performance in this film leaves one in awe.  It is wide and deep, cruel and unbelievably tender, and very, very moving.  Gloria Grahame gives unquestionably the best performance of her career.  The role was to go to Lauren Bacall, but Warner Brothers refused to lend her to Santana Productions for the film.  Though I admire Bacall's early work, I am glad we got Grahame with her flower-like fragility.
It is a murder mystery, but more it is an in-depth character study and even a life study.  Dix (Bogart's character) is full of rage which he has for years refused to confront.  Laurel (Grahame's character) is lost.  Both her film career and her search for a meaningful love are illusive at best.  They genuinely fall deeply in love.  Was she not strong enough?  Was he not brave enough?  We see what could have been, and are left with what will never be.
My great compliments to Art Smith, whom I consider to be the greatest character actor of his time (he played the psychiatrist in Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid, one of William Powell's later films).  The scene in which he is violated is a great moment in film.
Hats off to a deeply moving film, brutally honest and perfectly executed, each performance being a gem of its own.",1024358400,106,2121,4.788461538461538
514383,5,6302801133,"Dix Steel is weary, tired yet still functioning in the town that created him and his kind. He's always had a short temper that has gotten him into trouble. The hip restaurant and bar where all the brass hang out, the shadowy streets and spanish style apartment complex in which the main characters live, haunts them and us, as a brutal murder hangs over the heads of a large cast of Hollywood characters. Dread and love and fate ring through this work. The director's wife, Gloria Grahame, is excellent next to Bogart, in one of his best film performances. A great, powerful film.",1023062400,3,580,4.640776699029126
514384,5,6302801133,"Humphrey Bogart is within his familiar metier as a rebellious loner who lives by night in ""In a Lonely Place.""  He finds his perfect match in director Nicholas Ray, whose finest films dealt with rebels by night, such as ""They Live by Night"" and the greatest movie ever on the subject of rebellious youth, James Dean at his most overpowering in ""Rebel Without a Cause.""  This is some of Bogart's finest work, and the same applies to his leading lady, Gloria Grahame, whose marriage to director Ray was in its final stages when this movie was being made.
Bogart is Dix Steele, who is immersed in physical violence, which is taking a toll on his career as a screenwriter, as evidenced by the fact that he attacked and injured the producer of one of the films on which he was working.  He also physically attacked one of his girlfriends.  Bogart won applause from the men who served under him in World War Two, including Frank Lovejoy, who is later put in the position of investigating his former commanding officer as a Beverly Hills policeman.
Bogart lives in an apartment with a courtyard view.  Across that courtyard is the apartment of Grahame.  He is able to observe her actions when their windows are open, reminiscent of Burt Lancaster watching Susan Sarandon in ""Atlantic City.""  When they strike up a romance Bogart feels an infusion of life that propels him to greater efforts as a screenwriter.  Grahame, a struggling actress, helps out by typing pages he has finished in longhand.
This is film noir, however, and not a ""they lived happy ever after"" scenario.  Bogart is a passionate man and the violent side remains within him.  He is being investigated as a possible killer of a hatcheck girl he has brought home from the restaurant-nightclub he frequents to provide him with background abut a novel he wishes to avoid reading, but is being asked to adapt to a screenplay.  When she is found dead not long after leaving Bogart's apartment, suspicion abounds at the Beverly Hills Police Station, given his violent past.  Old foxhole mate Lovejoy argues on Bogart's behalf that he is innocent.
Eventually Bogart's romance with Grahame and his status as a murder suspect reach a simultaneous crescendo.  There are two murder suspects, Bogart and the deceased woman's fiance.  Grahame, while feeling great affection for Bogart, is well aware of his violent side, which even Bogart's agent believes will never terminate.  He would like a marriage and children.  Will she take the risk?
It is fascinating to see how the two major plot points of this hard hitting, bruisingly realistic movie are resolved.  The story resolutions are deftly handled with an ironic twist at the film's conclusion.",1011398400,5,2697,4.866520787746171
514385,5,6302801133,"For all the praise film-noir is lavished with (quite a lot of it valid), the majority of it relies on convention as much as the standard white-picket-fence, happy-ending 'family' film does: just invert the cliches and bathe them in deep-focus shadows. While this movie, on its surface, resembles the classic-style film noir of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, beneath the surface it's a whole different animal. No calculating evil females or tough guys masking hearts of gold populate IN A LONELY PLACE. It's a much more wrenching and powerfully disturbing film because the murder that draws the protagonists together turns out to be of peripheral importance, while the love story between Humphrey Bogart's troubled screenwriter and Gloria Grahame's B-actress spins inexorably towards damnation completely on its own power. The basic story has him a suspect in a killing, and her in love with him yet unsure of his innocence, but director Nicholas Ray stages the proceedings so that WE see it's not the murder that disturbs her but her own conviction that his self-destructive and volatile nature will destroy them both. To his credit, Ray never takes the easy way out of having Bogart turn monster on her. You care inordinately about the characters, hoping hard (as Bogart's agent does in the film) that some transforming moment will come that will spare these people and allow their deeply felt love to flourish and heal them both - even as the evidence before your own eyes tells you there ain't no way. For 1950 -hell, for any year- such an unsentimental and uncompromising treatment of a tragic adult relationship is a rarity. The shadows suffusing this excellent film come not from UFA-influenced lighting but from the Black Dahlia murder, the HUAC hearings, the death throes of old Hollywood & the moral and spiritual detachment of postwar American life. But most of all, they're projected from within the characters themselves. Grahame and Ray's own real-life deteriorating relationship formed the template for the doomed lovers, and for them, this film is an act of great courage. For his part, Bogart (the star and executive producer) takes elements of all his previous romantic loners and blends them with the harsh, sour pigments of Fred C Dobbs, running the risk of audience rejection. His performance is unflinchingly honest, among his best work ever. See this movie.",998697600,245,2366,5.100515463917525

Bogart is superb and 100% believable as a tormented soul prone to violence, with Grahame the perfect choice as a woman both in love with and terrified of him, as she begins the wonder if he's a maniacal killer suspected of a gruesome murder.

514388,5,6302801133,"This is one of those ""small"" films that get pushed aside in an actor's or director's body of work, and it deserves to be right at the top of both Bogart's and Nicholas Ray's best films.
Ray's direction is brilliant--use of light and shadows is great, and the pacing keeps you right on the edge of your seat.
Bogart gives probably one of the best (if not the best) performances of his career, and Gloria Grahame matches him.  The two of them play off of each other brilliantly.

514479,4,6302801133,"In a Lonely Place (1950) is a film noir that's considered one of the best in the genre; I agree with this assessment. However, it pales in comparison to the heavyweights of film noir, such as The Maltese Falcon, The Third Man, The Big Sleep, and Double Indemnity. For film noir to totally work, you need the darker elements (whether visually or plot-wise), a femme fatale, plot twists, and shady characters. While it delivers on all of the film noir elements, it's not as dark as I would like, its pacing is a tad slow, the music not as compelling, and the suspense not quite there, though it is at the end of the film. I think of this film as a tad more of drama over film noir.  However, I think this film has the perfect cast to make up for some of the minor shortcomings. The Criterion Collection blu ray is a wonderful product, and has some great extras, as well as an immaculate picture and sound quality. Overall, In a Lonely Place is a solid offering in the film noir genre, and essential for collectors.",1517443200,,1012,4.382978723404255

514484,5,6302801133,"In a Lonely Place features one of Humphrey Bogart's greatest performances in a film that few people know. Critics have always thought well of it and it was moderately popular in its day (1950) but it was not a true hit. It's a film fans of Bogart, Gloria Grahame  or film noir should see and hopefully it's availability in a streaming format will increase its viewership. It's a difficult film to pin down. It falls within the general noir universe but lacks many conventions of the noir film. It is not set in a world of crime although it includes a murder. It takes place in the world of Hollywood writers, agents and would-be actors who though not major figures, live in nice places and lead ordinary lives. None of the major players are really evil, not even Gloria Grahame's Laurel Gray who one assumes will be a femme fatale before the picture starts. There's not much in the way of action and no guns at all. And most of all, though the film includes a whodunit aspect, the real focus is on the relationship between screenwriter Dixon Steele (Bogart) and Laurel Gray (Grahame).

Nicholas Ray (They Live By Night; Rebel Without a Cause) directed the film, giving it his characteristic intensity and inspiring all the actors to fine performances. Bogart's Dixon Steele is one of the most complex and difficult performances he ever did. Within the first two minutes of the film he comes off as unlikable and possessing a serious violent streak that haunts him throughout. This is much darker and more difficult for an audience to accept than the cynicism of Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe or Rick Blaine. He's played worse characters before, especially in his gangster film days and memorably as Captain Queeg in the Caine Mutiny, but those were one dimensional characters and you were supposed to hate them. Here he has to balance the characters troubled psyche in a way that makes him redeemable and possessing a really nice, even charming side, and this he does so well that you never know just how the film will turn out. Nevertheless I think that's what made the film less popular than Bogart's other films: people liked him as a tough guy but not as a possible psychotic.  I think the film really disturbed many people.

The rest of the cast is also excellent. Most people now know Grahame as the town flirt from It's a Wonderful Life and as Ado Annie in Oklahoma! but this is probably her best role. She's in love with Dixon but frightened of him and plays it in a totally believable and sympathetic way. Nicholas Ray went out on a limb casting her because she was his wife but their marriage, unknown to anyone at the time, was on the rocks and about to end in a divorce. They agreed to be professional and not let personal issues cloud the film and it worked. The rest of the cast, not generally well known, is doing their best as well. Frank Lovejoy and Jeff Donnell are particularly good as Dixon's old army buddy and now police detective and his wife. Old silent film star Robert Warwick plays an over the hill alcoholic actor who adds the film's only overt humor. Oddest of all is Ruth Gillette as Martha, Laurel's masseuse. She seemed really sinister, like she had some kind of control over Laurel and seemed scarier than Bogart. There just seemed to be something going on there and I don't know if it was written that way or if she just overplayed it. It's a tiny role, but memorable.

Ahead of its time in 1950, this is a film not to be missed.",1507161600,4,3459,4.554662379421222

514517,5,6302801133,"Other reviewers have noted that there is no happy ending here- I'd say it depends on whose story you're telling.  I'm not a fan of films of this era, with theatrical-style performing, and the sound track so loud and percussive that it nearly drowns out the lines.  But Bogart and Grahame are so good that I forgot about those annoyances and got into their groove.  I only saw one review that even used the term ""domestic violence,"" but that is what this is about.  I see it as Lauren's story, played by Grahame, who grows from alienated starlet wanna-be to a courageous woman who is willing to walk away.  And the Bogart character finally got to be a hero, when he- not until the very end- refrained from using force to make her (or her corpse) stay (or, more accurately, to not leave).  I noticed some reviewers had wanted a happy ending- what would that have been?  For all to be forgiven, since he is not a murderer, only an abuser?  This WAS the happy ending- she learned something and got out alive, and he apparently learned too.  The film gives us a realistic picture of how domestic violence was viewed and dealt with in 1950, but also gives us a character, in Lauren, who manages to break out of the enabling mold.  At the end, she lets us know how hard this was for her, because she really did love him.  Complex subject and plot, brilliantly wrapped in a classic noir format.",1503878400,2,1386,4.438735177865612

514595,5,6302801133,"Lonely places in people's hearts are explored in this 1950s noir directed by Nicholas Ray. The film is based loosely on a novel by Dorothy Hughes which has recently been included in a Library of America Anthology of crime writing by women,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Women-Crime-Writers-Four-Suspense-Novels-of-the-1940s-Laura-The-Horizontal-Man-In-a-Lonely-Place-The-Blank-Wall-Library-of-America/dp/1598534300/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Women Crime Writers: Four Suspense Novels of the 1940s: Laura / The Horizontal Man / In a Lonely Place / The Blank Wall (Library of America)</a>.

Humphrey Bogart portrays Dixon Steele, a talented, down-on-his luck Hollywood screenwriter with an explosive temper he struggles to keep in check.  Gloria Grahame  portrays Laurel Gray, a minor, struggling actress. Dixon and Laurel live in the same Hollywood apartment complex and begin a romance when Dixon comes under suspicion for a murder.  Although intense, the relationship is doomed through the nature of the two characters as they are locked within themselves.  The investigation of the crime and of Dixon's alleged role brings out their incompatibility.  Bogart offers an outstanding performance of the mercurial, violent, and creative screenwriter. Grahame also captures the loneliness and vulnerability of Laurel.  The music in the film is by classical music composer George Antheil.

The film differs substantially from Hughes' novel.  People often disagree about the merits of a book and its film adaptation.  In this case, I thought each was outstanding in its medium.  In both the book and the film, Dixon Steele is a loner with strong tendencies to violence, but Hughes makes her protagonist a serial killer rather than a screenwriter. In both the book and the film, Dixon has an old WW II buddy who has become a police officer and who is involved in the on-going murder investigation.  There is a degree of irony in the film as Dixon takes a novel and makes something good and radically different with it in his screenplay, reminding those familiar with Hughes' novel of the large changes made in the film.  In addition to telling a story of loneliness and failed relationships, the movie also satirizes the pretentiousness and consumerism of Hollywood.

Films are meant to be seen in theaters. I had the good fortune to see ""In a Lonely Place"" in the beautiful AFI theater in suburban Washington D.C. as part of the annual Noir City D.C. film festival.  I have come to look forward to this festival every year.  Noir film scholar Foster Hirsch offered a perceptive introduction to this classic movie.

514677,5,6302801133,"EXCEPTIONNAL! This is a great film noir, surprising, shocking, even disturbing, with two great actors at the top of their game. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Dixon ""Dix"" Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is a Hollywood screenwriter. His talent is not questioned but he is also a rather unpleasant person and has a history of antagonizing people - also, he is going through a deep depression, which put his professional life in even more trouble. His loyal agent, Mel Lippman (Art Smith), struggles more and more to find work for him.

At the beginning of the film Steele catches a break - he receives a commission to adapt a recent bestseller for a high budget movie. However, being too lazy to read the book himself he pays a girl working in the restaurant where he had his dinner, to come with him home and tell him the story, which she seems to be very familiar with. The girl, a certain Mildred Atkinson (Martha Stewart), tempted by the promise of receiving one hundred dollars, accepts. When entering the appartment Steele and Mildred say hello to the somehow arrogant woman who just moved into the same building (Gloria Grahame), then the door closes behind them... and I will say nothing more about the story. However, this being a film noir made by Nicholas Ray, you can be certain that trouble will follow...

This is a highly original, very surprising film noir, in the same time very similar to most of other movies of this genre and in the same time quite different. The scenario is very strong and the director used it with optimum efficiency. The story keeps the viewer guessing and on the edge until the final three minutes and when the dark mystery is finally solved, things get even more poignant, until the ultimate line, just before the credits.

This is one of the very best performances by Bogart. His character is totally different from his other ""film noir"" heroes and anti-heroes, but I will say no more, to avoid spoilers. Gloria Grahame SHINES in this film, both by beauty and by her talent, exploring all the possibilities the scenario offered to her. Actors in supporting roles are equally excellent, Martha Stewart - cute like a button by the way - very much included. Stewart didn't make much of a career, as she withdrew from acting in 1952 to devote herself to her three kids, but it seems that she and her husband had a very happy life, until his death in 1982. Remarkably, in August 2016 Martha Stewart, currently aged 93, is still with us.

Special mention goes also to Art Smith, who plays the incredibly loyal agent and Robert Warwick, who plays a washed out actor - they are Steel's very last friends...

This is a very, very good movie, harder and more difficult than many other ""film noirs"", but really reamarkable. I will definitely keep the DVD for another viewing. TO SEE ABSOLUTELY!",1472601600,,2847,4.706827309236948

514681,4,6302801133,"It's hard to pin down what is centrally disturbing about this odd 1950 movie by Nicholas Ray.  It has a number of the visual trappings of a noir thriller, and there is even a murder to be accounted for, but the interest turns out to be on matters of personality -- and not just the personality of the screenwriter Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) and the question of the relation between creativity and a capacity of violence but the broader question of degrees of different-ness among people who work and live together on terms of professional acceptance, friendship, affection, and even love.  ALL of the people in this movie are odd and mysterious, and it's tempting to see them as ""damaged,"" but the film doesn't provide any rationale for us to think of them in that way, for all their oddness.  Bogart's central character is no more or less explicable than the others, so that the ""society"" of the movie is one of oddballs -- to put it neutrally -- whose oddnesses make relationships unstable and the chances of happiness in the way that happiness is usually represented in movies (stable, lasting, affectionate) uncertain.  What makes Mildred, the oddly literate hat-check girl (Martha Stewart), go home with Dixon in order to narrate to him the plot of a novel he can't be bothered to read?  Mildred is murdered after she leaves Dixon's house, and we know Dixon is innocent, but the police don't -- but Dixon's odd lack of affect, his imaginative interest in details of the murder, and his capacity for violent responses to frustration make the police suspicious and puzzle us (the viewers), since no ""reasons"" for his behaviour are given.  He just is what he is.  That's true too of Laurel Gray (Gloria Graham), who falls in love with him but who herself is living an odd hidden-away life, with hints that she has deserted a former lover, but for no reasons that are given.  And why is one detective convinced of Dixon's guilt, though there's no evidence of it, while another (who knows Dixon from army days) not.  Then there's the ""thespian"" Charlie and Dixon's agent Mel -- both of whom, along with Laurel, are victims of violent outbursts.  The highlight is the creepy car scene in which Dixon drives Laurel at night and dangerously fast until it ends in a crash and a fight in which Dixon does seem to come close to killing someone.

The murder is solved, almost in passing, but even before then we realize that that plot-resolution is going to make no difference to the psychological and social dynamics of the movie.  And while the ending is moving, it doesn't seem that one wants to condemn Laurel for what would be, in a more sentimental movie, a failure of trust that could be forgiven.  Interesting and unsettling stuff.  Individuality, represented as oddness, is the problem here, and even Blake's idea that ""opposition is true friendship"" isn't one that seems applicable or even possible.  The movie seems radically pessimistic about relationships.",1469577600,3,2966,4.811023622047244

514683,5,6302801133,"It seems that most of the notoriety that surrounded this film had more to do with what was going on around it and less about the actual film itself.  Which is an excellent example what appears to be standard film noir, but is something more.  The film was directed by Nicholas Ray, probably best known for Rebel Without a Cause but has a deep resume of excellent work.  When his first 2 choices for the lead actress (Ginger Rogers and Lauren Bacall) were unavailable, he cast his tempestuous wife Gloria Grahame (Oklahoma!) in the role of Laurel Gray.

Humphrey Bogart (Casablanca), plays Dixon Steele, a well-known screenwriter.  Hes fed up with writing dumb movies that follow the novels they're based on.  This film is loosely based Dorothy B. Hughes book and has a terrific script by Andrew Solt.  [Midway through the movie, Dix whos in the driver seat after a near car accident, recites to Laurel, who is now driving:  I was born when she kissed me, I died when she left me, I lived a few weeks when she loved me.  As that was sinking in I was grabbing the remote to back it up and listen again, then Laurel asks Dix where that came from and he says I just made it up and was trying to figure out how to use it.  He asks her to repeat it.  Now Im trying to figure out how to use it.  Masterful work by Solt.]

Dix has a reputation as an excellent writer but is also a pain in the arse and has a bad temper.  He has to explode sometimes exclaims his best friend and agent, Mel Lippmann (Art Smith).  A director Dix has worked with him before, Lloyd Barnes (Morris Ankrum), insists he read a book and sign on to write the screenplay.  A hat check girl at the restaurant is a big fan of Dix and the book so offers to provide him with an oral synopsis.  Dix invites her back to his place.  Its about midnight already but Mildred (Martha Stewart, no not that one) agrees.  Already, were not sure about Dix and certainly what his intentions might be.  As it turns out, hes too tired to even let her finish her ginger ale, not to mention hes just laid eyes on his beautiful new neighbor, Laurel.  Dix shoos Mildred out the door with $20 and tells her a cab stand is just around the corner.

Dix is awakened at 5 AM by an old Army buddy named Brub (Frank Lovejoy) who also happens to be a police detective.  Brub drags Dix down to the station to be confronted by Capt. Lochner (Carl Benton Reid), who tells Dix that young Mildred is deadmurdered.  Dixs couldnt-care-less-attitude makes him the top suspect for the crime.  Fortunately hes alibied by Laurel who saw Mildred leave his apartment alone.  As it turns out Laurel, a sometime actress who's hiding from her former boyfriend, and Dix fall for each other.  She likes his face, she says.  His fiery personality begins to come out more often, the closer they get.  To the point where jealousy jeopardizes the relationship as much as his combative ways.

Director Ray gets the most out of his actors.  Early on youll think youve seen this Bogart character before.  Whip smart with both his tongue and his fists.  But in his usual private investigator roles, the other guy deserved what he got.  Here, the recipient doesnt.  Bogarts Dix looks mean and unattractive in several scenes, scary to both Laurel and the audience.  In one great scene, Dix is explaining how the murder might have been committed by Mildreds boyfriend.  He uses Brub and his wife Sylvia (Jeff, yes a woman, Donnell) in a demonstration.  Ray and his cameraman and lighting tech use soft light focused on Dixs face, highlighting his excitement of the re-creation.  Spooky.  Grahame, as well, couldn't be any better.  Laurel wants to commit to Dix, but as the story goes on, she questions whether they would ever work out and she isn't even sure that he didn't kill Mildred.  Neither are we.

The excellent supplements provided by Criterion suggest there is a lot of the real-life drama going on between Ray and Grahame.  They had separated, with Ray living at the studio.  The films producer, Robert Lord even had Grahame sign a contract, agreeing that Ray was to be her boss between 9AM and 6PM and that she will do whatever he says.  It seems to have worked.  Gloria Grahame and Nicholas Ray eventually divorced after she had an affair with Rays son Tonywho was 13!  The film may have been overshadowed by the real-life drama but is worth seeking out.  It is a near masterpiece and perhaps the casts and Rays best work.",1468886400,4,4441,4.498122653316646

514709,5,6302801133,"""In a Lonely Place""(1950) may not be considered a typical ""noir"" film upon first viewing, but it certainly contains many of the elements that made this genre successful in the Forties and Fifties. There's a murder of a young woman in the beginning that police suspect Humphrey Bogart's character(Dixon Steele) of committing and his behavior throughout the film certainly leads audiences to that conclusion. Bogart's portrayal of Steele, a violent, quick- tempered, and down-on-his-luck screenwriter is one of his best performances and may have been close to what he was like in real life. But there's more to ""In a Lonely Life"" than meets the eye. Nicholas Ray's starkly cynical look at post war Hollywood in 1950 where celebrity, near-celebrity, personal disappointments and especially destructive relationships often clash(sometimes violently) seems more relevant today than ever. It's a difficult film to watch at times but one that is still powerful over sixty years after it's release due in no small part to it's stars Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame. Criterion has now released ""In a Lonely Place"" on Blu-ray for the first time and the results are once again simply outstanding. According to the liner notes from the enclosed booklet: ""This new 2K digital transfer was created from a new 35 mm fine grain master positive made from the original camera negative"" and Criterion has given the film a high bitrate(34.91). This makes for a nearly pristine picture from start to finish. There are no vertical lines, dirt, debris, torn or damaged frames that were a problem with earlier DVD versions of the film. Most of the film takes place inside apartments, nightclubs, police stations and other locales around Los Angeles and this is where the B & W cinematography by Burnett Guffey is really highlighted. Individual props, furniture, costumes are very detailed now on Blu-ray. Close-ups of individual actors are especially vivid, with Bogart's ravaged looks being almost hard to watch. On the other hand, Gloria Grahame's close-ups showcase exactly how beautiful the tormented star was(something she was always concerned about in real life). The Audio(English LPCM mono) is crystal clear and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, crackle, etc.). Again from the liner notes: ""The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35 mm soundtrack negative"". All in all, this is another outstanding Blu-ray presentation from Criterion following their recent ""film noir"" Blu-ray releases of ""Night and the City"" and ""Glida"". ""In a Lonely Place"" is 93 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.33:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include a 1975 documentary about director Nicholas Ray(40:33 minutes); An interview with Gloria Grahame biographer Vincent Curcio(16:40 minutes); An interview with film director Curtis Hanson(20:23 minutes); a 1948 radio adaptation of the original Dorothy Hughes novel(59:56 minutes) and the theatrical trailer. There is an informative booklet included by critic Imogen Sara Smith. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a standard clear Criterion Blu-ray case. ""In a Lonely Place"" is a different kind of ""film noir"" that contains two great performances by Humphrey Bogart and Gloria Grahame. Fans of the actors and the film itself will certainly want to add this to their film library. It comes highly recommended.",1465776000,6,3394,5.369606003752345

514755,5,6302801133,"In a Lonely Place is a film noir thriller set in Hollywood. Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) is a cynical screenwriter down on his luck who has turned to the bottle and become belligerent. His agent, Mel Lippman (Art Smith), asked him to adapt a book for a movie. After discussing the book with hat-check girl Mildred Atkinson (Martha Stewart), whos just finished reading it, he dismisses it as trash. The next morning, old army buddy and now police detective Brub Nicholai (Frank Lovejoy) informs Dix that he is the main suspect in Mildreds murder, committed the night before.

Directed by Nicholas Ray (Rebel Without a Cause), In a Lonely Place was produced by Bogart and released in 1950, the same year as Sunset Boulevard, another picture that showed the dark side of Hollywood. Bogarts Dix is a bitter guy who finds himself in a sticky situation. Gloria Grahame as Dixs neighbor Laurel Gray has some terrific scenes, often overshadowing Bogart himself.

Made three years after the advent of the House Un-American Activities Committee, the movie contains a not-so-subtle political subtext. Whether you pick this up or not, the film offers a fascinating character study of a desperate man beaten down by a system and thrown into the midst of a murder investigation, setting in motion a love story between Dix and Laurel. This is complicated by Laurels own demons and her fear that Dixs volatile nature will destroy them both.

Humphrey Bogart made 53 films as a contract player for Warner Brothers between 1932 (""Three on a Match"") and 1948 (""Key Largo"").
In 1949, he left Warner to become an independent producer, starring in 17 films between 1949 and 1956.
Bogart's production company had two big Technicolor successes: ""The African Queen"" (1951 - Bogart's only Oscar) and ""The Caine Mutiny"" (1954),
but film scholars have always had a soft spot for the more modest black and white psychological thriller ""In a Lonely Place"" (1950).
The 2002 Sony DVD had an excellent picture, but fourteen years on, Blu-Ray technology offers increased resolution.
Criterion has a well-deserved reputation for quality and scholarship.
The new Blu-Ray includes a commentary track, plus biographical features about co-star Gloria Grahame and director Nicholas Ray.

514791,5,6302801133,"Hello Ladies & Gentlemen,

  Sasha here! It's interesting. I'm taking acting for the camera classes, and we have the freedom to choose scenes from whatever films/TV series out there. I absolutely love the old films. I was originally going to do a scene from 'The Big Heat (1953),' but my scene partner comes to be the woman that I am deeply in love with, but the circumstance and situation is complicated. I was searching on YouTube and found an iconic scene from 'In a Lonely Place' w/ Humphrey Bogart & Gloria Grahame. Gloria is my all-time favorite American actress.

514861,3,6302801133,"In a Lonely Place, 1950 film

A screenwriter drives on a street. Dixon Steele is a nobody. [No answering machines in those days.] The scenes tell about the people. A popcorn salesman? There is personal conflict due to egotism. Dixie meets Mildred Atkinson and asks her to read a book to him. They discuss a murder mystery. Is it a powerful story? Later a police detective visits him on official business to take him in for questioning. Mildred was found murdered and dumped in Benedict Canyon. Recording by tape or wire? Does Dix have an alibi? Captain Lockner talks to Miss Gray, a new resident at that apartment. She saw Dixon at home around 12:30 AM. We hear about Laurel Grays past. Steele has a record of fighting and playing rough. Miss Gray visits him to talk.

The detective talks to Steele about the murder. Dixon tries to recreate the murder; it was done in the car, he says. Is there something wrong with him? His agent Lippman drops by, Steele is working like crazy. He writes in longhand. [Manic behavior?] Dix is adapting a novel to the screen. [Simplifying the story to fit into two hours.] Sgt. Nicolay asks Miss Gray to visit the police. The Captain says Dix is the logical suspect. Later he talks to another man. There is a song at a nightclub. The Dix leaves with Miss Gray after he sees a man and his wife. Martha warns Miss Gray about Dixons past girlfriend. That night they visit the Nicolays home. Dixon gets upset about some news and rushes off! He speeds and has a near accident! Stop, youll kill him! The assault is front page news. Dixon sends money to John Mason. Is there something wrong with Dix? [PTSD?

Miss Laurel Gray has nightmares about her situation. She takes pills, she is a sound sleeper. She also worked at night typing pages. Dix prepares grapefruit for breakfast. He asks her about those pills. Will they marry? Yes. But Dix doesnt act like a normal person. He has a tremendous ego. The script is finished. Laurel doesnt want to go to Las Vegas. They visit that bar for a celebration. But Dix is upset and agitated over the release of the script. Brody loves the script! Dix apologizes to Mel for his actions. But Laurel has left! Sgt. Nicolay called Dix, there was a confession about the murder of Mildred Atkinson. Dix guns after Laurel to apologize for his actions. There is a telephone call from Sgt. Nicolay. Captain Lockner wants to apologize to Laurel. Is it too late? There is a change in plans.

Bogart plays a unique role in this movie. Before the 1941 movie The Maltese Falcon he played villains, such as in High Sierra, a better story than the TMF. Dixon is not a hero but someone who suffers from emotional problems. It was called Shell Shock then, now its PTSD. Dixon is not an admirable character, this must have not been as successful as other movies. Was it based on any real murder? Does working under high pressure affect a persons emotional state? Dorothy Hughes novel may have been bowdlerized and censored to present a more favorable character. Is this book in your public library system?

514907,5,6302801133,"IN A LONELY PLACE is a brilliant film from director Nicholas Ray. Humphrey Bogart with his usual cragged-faced presence dominates the screen once again. This time he is a man totally introverted and obsessed with some hidden lack of ability to express his own compassion and humanity. Bogart plays an elusive Hollywood screenwriter named Dixon Steele that becomes the focus of a police investigation of a murder in this atmospheric and unsettling film. What makes the film so unsettling is Bogart's performance. He is a very enigmatic, private and tired man who at times seems so detached from reality that it is frightening. Yet Bogart in this role still posses a virile and cynical coolness of style that is so appealing and it is one that only he can pull off with his screen charisma bringing this character to reality and believability.
In the film Bogart lives in a complex of courtyard apartments. The police investigation interferes with a relationship that Bogart has with Gloria Grahame who lives in the same complex. Bogart comes to be intrigued (and visa versa) by her and truly falls in love with her. Yet it is the police investigation that continues to intensify Bogart's inner struggle as a human being with his need to love and be loved and escalates his volatile and violent outbursts which confuse and distance Grahame from him.
IN A LONELY PLACE examines such human qualities and frailties of love, trust and loyalty. It explores and exposes the effects of our interpretations, perceptions and misconceptions and ultimately demonstrates that our own human flaws can lead to perpetual loneliness of the heart if left unchecked. IN A LONELY PLACE is an outstanding and important film.",1414972800,,1702,4.996478873239437

This is the SEEDY SIDE OF 50s HOLLYWOOD with GRAHAME a stand-out as a tough little ""been around the block"" cookie that begins to crumble once she lets sociopath BOGART into her life. What can happen, when people who should have never met.....do?

Starts out Bogart is a Hollywood screenwriter on the edge of ""has been"" status because of writer's block and raging alcohol and anger issues. One woozy night he invites a cute hat-check girl to his place for a nightcap and a late night ""book report."" Next day, she's found dead! And he's the last person known to have been seen with her. Oh, oh!

Grahame, a struggling small-time actress, lives in his apartment complex and has noticed him noticing her. She helps him out with a convenient makeshift alibi, mutual attraction sets in and the story rapidly escalates into a full-on PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER.

This NOIR is INTRIGUING RIGHT FROM THE START with an unusually COMPELLING SCREENPLAY and it's glimpse at 50's era Tinseltown.  Be warned, THIS IS INTENSE but it will keep you guessing. The stars of ""IN A LONELY PLACE"" are each at the top of their acting primes....Grahame never better, really impresses here, and Bogart scores as a WWII post-traumatic psycho haunted by his past.

515005,4,6302801133,"I admit, admit up front, that I am partial to rugged windmill-chasing Humphrey Bogart roles like him as Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon trying to get a little rough justice in this wicked old world and not afraid to take a beating for the cause, or bust up some wrong gee dreams in the process (although admittedly getting a little thrown off the tracks by a whiff of Mary Astor's perfume, but that is to be expected). Or another windmill-chaser, Rick, in Casablanca when he knows, knows deep in his soul that the troubles of three love-stuck people in that wicked old World War II Nazi world didn't amount to a ""hill of beans"" against the darkening night (although there too he was thrown off by that damn dame perfume). And what about his role in To Have And Have Not when he is again forced, as Captain Harry Morgan, to step it up a notch in that still wicked old World War II world (that time, come to think of it, he too got thrown off the tracks  by a woman, by a whistler of all things).

After that big manly, windmill-chasing build-up, complete with cigarette, unfiltered, of course, Luckies probably, in hand it is hard to see old Bogie as kind of troubled, well, dope. A guy who can't handle his emotions, or his fists, when some little breeze problem come s through the door. Against friend of foe, against some Johnny Rico or some frail. However that is exactly the problem before us as Bogie plays a troubled screen writer (aren't they all, troubled that is, having to write some pretty tough stuff to earn their dollar a word).

Maybe I had better give you the ""skinny"" here so you'll get my drift. Dix (Bogie) is a maybe ""has been"" writer who is in a dry spell. He invites a hat- check girl from the club home (what club? any club, any gin joint in the world) to give him the story line of a book that he is supposed to do the screenplay for. And that is all he wants. (Ya, I know that ""come on"" is weak but there it is). The problem: early next morning she is found dead, very dead, in some arroyo road side ditch. And Dix is primo suspect numero uno. Enter one lovely blond alibi, Lauren (played by Gloria Grahame), who had seen Dix sent the hat check girl off alone. Dix is still not off the hook though since downtown (the cops, okay) are not convinced that Dix didn't do it. This unlikely pair begins an affair. The story then gets tense as Lauren (and others) begin to believe Dix did do it after he exhibited extreme anger (and violent acts) at the accusations.  Well, Dix didn't do it but he lost Laurel by his mad man American Psych 101 demeanor. And so he walks alone at the end, a contrite but broken man.

See, no foggy airfield sent-offs amid the clamor of war next fights, no fast boat get-aways to Free French territory and the fight continues, and no wacko stuff of dreams busted wiser man here, just alone. Bogie alone. Jesus.",1342310400,,2859,4.336448598130841
515006,4,6302801133,"Why do I love Humphrey Bogart so much? He's not all that handsome (we're talking in the movies, after all; this was 1950), no Johnny Depp for looks or style. But he's intense. Man oh man, is he intense.

I can't help using the present tense about this movie, even though it is over 60 years old. I was three when it was made. But it is the sort of movie that puts the audience right into the middle, feeling everything the characters feel.

Bogart is Dixon Steele, a screenwriter who hasn't had a hit for awhile. In fact, his last movie was a flop. So he's given a tacky little nothing book and told to write a screenplay that is faithful to the book. But he asks the hatcheck girl at his friend's restaurant, who has read it, to tell him the story so he doesn't have to. She complies, mispronouncing lots of words and bubbling with enthusiasm for what is clearly a very mediocre story. He thanks her, gives her money for taxi fare, and she goes home.

Or so he thought. Early the next morning he gets rousted out by his friend, a cop, who takes him down town to his boss, because the hatcheck girl was murdered during the night.

But this is not really a murder mystery movie. This is a drama about love and trust, and I won't spoil it by telling you any more than that. It's a suspense, but the audience is not focused on the investigation of the murder. My focus was, as it was intended to be, on the romance between Steele and his neighbor. And I loved watching it grow and then die, as suspicion and distrust ruined it.

Bogart's alibi is provided by neighbor Laurel Gray and they soon begin a romance.

515010,5,6302801133,"This is an excellent movie, in which Bogart displays all the talent of a well-seasoned actor.  His portrayal of a WWII veteran returned to his career as a Hollywood screenwriter is poignant and sad in some ways, because it subtly pictures the life of a talented man whose life was interrupted by his service in a horrifying war.  As the movie develops, viewers learn that the character, bravery, and loyalty of Bogart's on-screen character shown through in wartime, but these traits had little value as he tried to readjust to civilian life in a world of egos and make believe that is the Hollywood movie industry.  ""In a Lonely Place"" could not be made in today's world of political correctness where tales of individual lives must carry some overt indictment of world and political systems, and deep rooted inner conflicts are handily classified under lay psychiatric terms like ""anger management"" problems, without analysis of underlying causes.

The action in this movie is intimately personal, the relationship between Bogart's character and that of Grahame's character is both passionate and tense.  The love story portrayed is that of an older man with one last chance at creativity sparked by the inspirational love of a younger woman, sort of a 1940s lite version of Henry Miller's relationship with Brenda Venus.  The loyalty felt by the junior detective investigating his former wartime commander for murder, speaks volumes to the unique bond shared between ordinary people who have faced the extraordinary deprivations of war together, something others cannot comprehend who have not endured the same dangers and hardships.  Overall, I highly recommend ""In a Lonely Place"" to fans of Bogart, Grahame, and movie aficionados.",1319241600,,1735,5.197132616487456
515011,5,6302801133,"This is a great, but uncomfortable film, about a deeply flawed man.  Dixon Steele.  Although he hasn't written a successful script for some time, is still a highly regarded writer.  He is also a revolving, 360 degree pig.  He is moody, self-centered with numerous flashes of violent anger.  Because, as we learn, Dix had some kind of unspecified military role during the War, we might conclude that Dix' personality is the product of PTSD.  That would be a far too superficial analysis of the labile, non-insightful Dix.

A lovely young woman has been brutally murdered.  She is the same young woman Dix lured to his apartment the previous night on the pretext of her retelling and summarizing a book she's written and would like to see worked into the script of a film.  The whole thing--including the girl--is so shallow and dreary to the world-weary Dix that he tells her to find her own way home.  ""Here's some money for the taxi.""  He gallantly offers.

The next morning Dix is picked up by the cops and interrogated.  On learning of the girl's death, Dix is neither frightened nor guilty about the fact that, by not seeing her safely home, he has inadvertently delivered her up to death.  Dix, as a matter of fact, is cool, calm, unflustered and uncaring.  He's even too stupid to recognize that his thoughtless behavior NECESSARILY puts him under the police microscope.  Let me emphasize that these are not PTSD symptoms.  They are symptoms of something far darker and deeper...something produced perhaps by twisted DNA.

The woman Dix supposedly loves becomes increasingly frightened of her unpredictable paramour.  She doesn't know whether he's a murderer or not but she does know that he's explosive and dangerous.  She's caught in a classical 'abused woman' scenario.  She needs to get out...and get out now...before he kills her.

I believe Bogart was at his very best when playing deeply flawed characters.  'Treasure of the Sierra Madre' and 'The Caine Mutiny' are other excellent examples.",1317686400,2,2004,4.934131736526946
515012,5,6302801133,"I think every woman and every man should watch this film, for all it has to say about relationships and why they tend not to work. I have known this story before i saw the film, i've known it in my own life, in the lives of my friends, those of us who tend to isolate the ones we love. I love Film Noir and films of this period in general because of their simplicity. How can a movie express so much in an hour and 34 minutes? On all levels, the screenplay, the cast, the director, the cinematographer, they all come together to give you one of the most honest and revealing films of the day.

Humphrey Bogard plays Dix Steele, a good guy by all accounts, but who harbors disturbing secrets and a violent temper. The film opens up with a murder, but the real mystery here is Dix. From the outset you find yourself wondering about him, is he a good guy, is he a bad guy. The amazing thing about this movie is how he can paint such a complex character in such a short amount of time. Bogart gives what is probably his truest performance, so true in fact many remark how little it looks like a performance at all. Bogart shows more of himself here than I would be comfortable showing all but the closest friends.

Then there is the relationship. A love story, the happy times, the love that blinds you to all faults. And of course the unhappy realization that comes when you open your eyes and realize the man you love just might be capable of killing someone, of killing you.

The only flaw i could maybe see in the movie, I would have preferred we got to know Gloria Graham's character a little better. The director does not seek to have us sympathize with her, maybe a mistake but maybe it would not be film noir if he had. Ultimately this is unimportant, we all know a Laurel Gray, and we will sympathize with her dilemma just the same. If not more so because of it. Bogart's character is beautifully developed, we can sympathize with him because we know he is ultimately a good guy, a loyal friend, a man who truly loves. But his peculiarities as is often the case with these ""unnormal"" people, get in the way. We are forced in the end however to abandon sympathy and take pity on him, he is tragically broken, his girl, his friends, he forces everyone to abandon him, even the audience. In a way this movie reminded me of Raging Bull, which may have found inspiration here, and helped me appreciate that film even more.

This is a cautionary tail, a normal tale, one i have heard many times coming from where I come from. Watch this movie and think of your own relationships with your loved ones. The movie teaches us to remember that everyone has weaknesses yes, and these weaknesses are a part of who they are, but that is no excuse. Dix's agent and friend Art Smith said it best ""you have to take the good and the bad"". But we learn in the end that if the bad is bad enough, it will ultimately drive everyone away and you will be left in a lonely place indeed.",1312070400,,2966,4.281639928698752
515043,4,6302801133,"Columbia Pictures  presents ""IN A LONELY PLACE"" (1950) (94 min/B&W) -- Starring Humphrey Bogart, Gloria Grahame, Frank Lovejoy, Carl Benton Reid & Art Smith

Directed by Nicholas Ray

Screenwriter Dixon Steele, faced with the odious task of scripting a trashy bestseller, has hat-check girl Mildred Atkinson tell him the story in her own words. Later that night, Mildred is murdered and Steele is a prime suspect; his record of belligerence when angry and his macabre sense of humor tell against him. Fortunately, lovely neighbor Laurel Gray gives him an alibi. Laurel proves to be just what Steele needed, and their friendship ripens into love. Will suspicion, doubt, and Steele's inner demons come between them?

Despite the fact that the plot is ostensibly a 'did he do it?' crime story, this is largely inconsequential to the psychological character and relationship study that is the central concern of the film. The script is smart, witty and cynical, just like a typical Bogart character. But in this film Bogart plays probably his darkest character. The cynical, darker aspects of this film just go to highlight how few contemporary films are prepared to be so bleak.

In some of the scenes with Gloria Grahame he's at his smooth, wisecracking, slightly irritable best, but in the moments where the anger and the fog of despair descends he is a more threatening character than in any of his other leading man roles.

If you like a cracking script with sharp performances, with all kinds of deep psychological observations on love and loneliness to be read into it, in the best noir tradition, this is the film for you.

""In A Lonely Place"" could be director Nicholas Ray's best. It's a fascinating movie that mixes drama, suspense and romance in a very interesting way. You could call it Noir I suppose, but it's a very difficult movie to tie down.

Powerful Bogie noir - often described as one of his best (now that's saying something!)

In-jokes and incidental business also make this a writers' film. This explains the film's message: Authority can ruin people's lives merely by investigating, even when lawful and acting in good faith. The film is intelligible as reaction to Congressional witch hunts and studio blacklists, and this makes its ending inevitable. [...]",1300665600,2,806,5.448

Director Nicholas Ray's superb film noir, IN A LONELY PLACE stars Humphrey Bogart as Dixon Steele, a brilliant screenwriter with an unpredictable violent temper who hasn't had a hit film in a decade. Assigned by a producer to transcribe a trash novel, Dix learns that the hatcheck girl at a restaurant where Hollywood insiders gather is familiar with the book, so he invites her home to tell him the story. The resulting interplay between them is the movie's only bit of humor (and it's deftly handled by both).

After becoming annoyed with the girl's run-on description and mispronunciations, Steele wanders over to a window where he observes a negligee-clad woman (Grahame) who's watching him from a nearby apartment balcony; Dix closes the blinds. He sends the hatcheck girl off with $20 and instructs her to walk around the block to a taxi stand, then he goes to bed.

Steele's awakened at 5 AM by a friend, Det. Sgt. Brub Nikolai (Lovejoy), who wants him to come to HQ for questioning. Under grilling from Capt. Lochner (Reid) Dix is nonchalant when he learns that the girl last seen with him has been found murdered-- tossed from a moving car ""like a cigarette."" The captain suspects Dix is the killer based on his uncaring manner and a long record of assaults (he even broke a producer's jaw).

A witness is called in-- the woman on the balcony: Laurel Gray. She tells the police that she saw the dead girl leave Steele's apartment *alone*; pure taradiddle, as he'd closed the blinds. Released from further questioning, a grateful Dix gives Laurel a ride home. This unusual way of being thrown together leads to the inevitable: the two fall deeply in love.

Laurel is brought back to police HQ for further questions. Capt. Lochner tells her of his suspicions and warns her to be careful. Steele's later violent explosions make Laurel begin to wonder if maybe her lover *did* kill the hatcheck girl?

Bogart and Grahame are absolutely brilliant in this movie. They both display so many emotions: passion, fear, longing, anger, joy, vulnerability, impatience, paranoia, confusion. If you haven't yet experienced ""In a Lonely Place,"" don't hesitate-- it's a truly great work!

(8.0) In a Lonely Place (1950) - Humphrey Bogart/Gloria Grahame/Frank Lovejoy/Carl Benton Reid/Art Smith/Jeff Donnell (uncredited: Ruth Warren/Billy Gray)",1291852800,,2952,5.6008968609865475
515046,5,6302801133,"This is a review for IN A LONELY PLACE (1950) which  was one of my favorite Bogart movies  for years but with the rise in popularity of film noir it's hardly the unknown film it once was. Which is all right by me, the more people who see something that's really good, the more chances there'll be of other good films being seen and appreciated, I believe.

IN A LONELY PLACE concerns an almost washed up screenwriter, Dixon Steele, played by Humphrey Bogart, who gets a chance to adapt a somewhat windy best selling ""epic novel"" into a screenplay as the basis for what hopefully will be a popular film. These words are not spoken in the film but it looks like this could be Dix Steele's last chance at a financially as well as artistically successful screenplay. Dix has a few problems, mainly drinking and a flashpoint temper that has led to a few violent episodes in the past including some involving the police. And now he is visibly aging but not necesarily mellowing.

In truth, Dix is not enamored with the bestseller he has been given to adapt and when a enthusiastic checkroom girl named Mildred Atkinson , played by a Martha Stewart, gushes over the book and the possiblilty of a movie based on it, Dix gives her the job of coming back to his apartment to read the tome to him so he might have some idea of the book without exerting any undue effort.

So the check room girl breaks her date with her banker boyfriend and goes with Dix to his courtyard apartment to dig into the book. Unfortunately things don't work out too well and Dix gives the girl some money for cabfare home and looking bone tired, says he's going to bed.

Next thing he knows it's 5 AM and an old army buddy, now a plainclothes detective, well played by Frank Lovejoy, is ringing his doorbell wanting to talk with him about Mildred Atkinson. It turns out she was murdered before she could get a cab and Dix was the last known person to have seen her alive.

While being questioned at the station house Dix answers to a police question that one person did see him when he said goodnight to Mildred Atkinson, a woman who lives across the courtyard. As it turns out the woman,
Laurel Gray, played by Gloria Grahame, has taken notice of Dix and is aware that he is a screenwriter.

As the film progresses so does the relationship between Dixon Steele and Laurel Gray. They both seem to get along well and she helps him with the screenplay, which needs a lot of help apparently.
At times Dix forgets everything of the outside world, his mind is strictly involved with his writing for the first time in many years. A lot of that has to do with Laurel's keeping his mind on the track of the story.

But occassionally another violent incident will occur, sometimes with Laurel there to witness it.
In the meantime the police investigation seems to be progressing slowly if at all and Dix is still a primary suspect. Sometimes Laurel can't help but wonder with the evidence of Dix's sometimes violent nature if he's the one who killed MIldred Atkinson.

In fact, that's the noirish part of the story that I enjoy most, the audience is left wondering if Dixon Steele can't control himself with ""these kids in their cut-down cars"" how would Dix react to an actual turndown from a young pretty girl? Especially after a couple of drinks, would he take it as a personal insult, something that had to be avenged immediately?

That's the crux of the decision that Laurel has to make about Dix and herself.....and the decision the audience has to make about Dixon Steele and the entire story of IN A LONELY PLACE.

It is a romance as well as a murder mystery with plenty of noir trappings thrown in, not just to confuse the characters, but to hold the audience in a gloomy cloud of suspense for as long as possible. And a fine job by
everyone involved, IN A LONELY PLACE is a memorable film, one that will hold your interest, to say the least, from beginning to end.

515047,5,6302801133,"This is a most excellent movie, for any era - and if you are an old movie enthusiast and haven't seen this, it's a rare one in all respects..

""In a Lonely Place"" ranks, in my opinion, as one of Bogart's best complex character work after having seen it for the first time not long ago. It's odd that a movie of this magnitude seems to take a lesser position in the press than does ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""To Have and Have Not"", which were fine film work to be sure, but the depth of emotion and character portrayal done by Bogie in this movie is simply outstanding, in my view.

Dix Steele is a talented, once powerful but now struggling Hollywood screen writer - whose soul is, indeed, lost in a ""lonely place"" from which he is powerless to extract himself.  Evidence of his personal failures is everywhere; they surround him, follow him.  His personality is such that it is easy for even those who know him best to suspect him of murder when a young woman he barely knew turned up dead after being at this apartment under totally benign circumstances.

The story line is truly ahead of it's time; it may even have been one of the first films to address the agony of a mental illness that takes control of a person who in all other respects seems normal until something triggers his violent, suspicious responses all of which seem to be tied to an unwarranted insecurity.  Adding to the remarkable insight of this story, he seems to know what his problem is.  He even retreats occasionally in the midst of a sudden, uncontrolled outburst as though he recognizes what he is doing; yet it is not enough to save him.  He loses his dignity, his pride; and literally all of his relationships to it, including the love and respect of a woman he has waited a lifetime to obtain and who tries to return his love;  his entire existence goes down before it.  It is painful to watch, and therefore, we are given the stark, ""lonely"" insight of how it must be to live with it.  Perhaps ""live through it"" each day might be a better choice of words.

Flawlessly written and connected, it keeps the viewer in a state of animated suspense.  The love interest is enchantingly portrayed by Gloria Grahame in her heyday, who does a remarkable job as the beautiful, bright and unusual woman living in the same apartment complex who becomes romantically entangled with Dixon; but they are doomed from the beginning; the very mystery that appeals to her finally turns to fear and drives her away from him - even as his own choice of scripted screenplay words eerily forecast the demise of their hopeless love:

515048,5,6302801133,"This was a very interesting role for Humphrey Bogart, and was a bit of a production code buster on several levels.

Bogart plays Hollywood screenwriter Dixon Steele, who is in somewhat of a writing rut. He also has a quick temper and a paranoia complex. He picks fights with people over the most routine matters and these fights commonly come to blows. He is indeed ""in a lonely place"" of his own making. Steele has a chance to write a screenplay based on a book, but the author wants him to read the book and give him his opinion in just a matter of a few days. At the restaurant where Steele has talked with the author, the hat check girl says she has just read the book and loves it. Steele invites her to come over to his apartment and tell him about the book to save him the trouble of reading it. This is all very innocent in what Steele intends and in what actually happens. In fact, Steele's reaction, unseen and unheard by the hat check girl, to her semi-literate oral book report is wickedly funny. After the girl tells her story, she leaves. Neighbor Laurel Grey (Gloria Grahame) sees her leave. However, the next day, the girl's strangled body is found next to a road. The police quickly find their way back to Steele's place where, due to his violent nature and nonchalant reaction to the murder, he is under immediate suspicion. He finds an alibi in his neighbor Laurel, and this is how they formally meet.

Almost immediately the two begin a relationship that gets serious fast. Laurel finds Steele attentive and interesting. Thus at first Laurel thinks Steele is innocent of the murder, but one by one her doubts grow. Steele explodes over little things, even eventually punching out his own agent over nothing. In fact, Steele's agent is his only real friend and actually is a bit of an enabler for his bad behavior. You always see Steele show his idea of remorse for his actions, even anonymously sending money to a guy he has beaten up over a traffic accident. However, the question that is left to be answered is - exactly what is going on with this guy? Could he have stalked and killed the girl over his anger at something else or someone else entirely? And if he didn't kill the hat check girl, will he eventually kill someone else? Laurel is asking these same questions as she begins to wonder - is it more dangerous to try and run away from Steele, or is it more dangerous to stay? One should never consider saying ""yes"" to a marriage proposal if it comes down to what is less dangerous.

Laurel is not exactly a finished book herself. Apparently she had a serious relationship with a well-off man just prior to this, and ended it for really no tangible reason. Then there is a kind of g ay subtext going on between herself and her masseuse Martha. They only have one scene together but it certainly throws out more questions than answers, just like the rest of this film.

It's hard to say more without saying too much. You just have to watch it. The acting, script and direction are first-rate while the visual style serves the story effectively.

515075,3,6302801133,"Any movie with Humphrey Bogart, at least in a starring role, is elevated immediately beyond the normal. The man was a consummate actor who specialized as a tough guy. That element is here in his portrayal of Dixon Steele, a fading screenwriter that has suffered burnout & is his own worst enemy. Director Nicholas Ray takes a stab at the Hollywood industry that was a very daring move for 1950.

In a Lonely Place, on the surface, is done as film-noir but it's not that genre in the classic sense. Steele is definitely a film-noir character: He's flawed, suspected in a murder & a man who's had more than one incident with the law. He's a screenwriter who hasn't done anything significant for years. He's approached to write a screenplay based upon a current trashy, best selling romance novel. Instead of reading the novel for himself he hires the hatcheck girl, Mildred (Martha Stewart), who has just finished reading it to give him an oral synopsis of it. This laziness lands him in trouble. He not only doesn't escort the girl to nearest taxi stand but he compounds the situation by the nature of his character. She is later found murdered, discarded on the side of the road.

Steele, of course, is the leading suspect. He's not very cooperative with the police which leads to even more suspicions. Enter Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahme), who gives him an alibi. She's the next door neighbor who alleges that Steele never left home. None of this is made very clear. Though Dix & Laurel begin a romance, inside, she's afraid of him. She's not even sure he didn't commit the murder. Which begs the question: Is she telling the truth or covering up for him? The film spends a lot of time on the romance; Steele's violent ways & Gray's inspiring him to produce the screenplay. The Steele character fits the film-noir genre but the Gray character isn't a femme-fatale that leads the male on the path of destruction.

It's a curious affair & much of it might have to do with Nicholas Ray's personal life. He was married to Gloria Grhame at the time but their marriage was already heading south. The DVD has bonus features: Sub-titles in 7 different languages; ""In a Lonely Place - Revisited"", the ""Restoration Story"" & trailers.",1246147200,7,2221,4.68974358974359

In the late 1940s and 1950s, as Bogart began to break away from Warner Brothers and do more independent films, he began more and more to explore a greater variety of roles. In this one, he plays a lawyer who managed to break out of the rough and nasty neighborhood where he grew up, and a young tough who has been unable to break out and has gotten himself into a string of bad situations. The young thug is played by John Derek, who would go on to appear in a number of films (such as ALL THE KINGS MEN and THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, in which he would play Joshua) before becoming a photographer and director an husband of a number of famed (and similar looking) beauties, including Ursala Andress, Linda Evans, and Bo Derek). Given the utterly horrible movies he directed starring Bo Derek, it was quite a nice surprise to see what a nice job he does in this film. He was not merely a pretty face; he had some talent.
Bogart managed to excel in every movie he was ever in, with only a few exceptions, like THE OKLAHOMA KID, a Western in which he played a Mexican bandit, complete with utterly unconvincing accent. Apart from that and a couple of other 1930s roles, Bogart managed to shine even when the rest of the movie was vile.

The problem with KNOCK ON ANY DOOR is twofold. One is the highly artificial script, in which much of the film is told in flashback in what is supposed to be the opening remarks at a trial. It is unbalancing to have so much of the film told in flashback at a moment in a trial when such personal remarks would have been inappropriate. As a result, the trial ends up feeling not so much like a trial as a parody of a trial. The second problem is that the movie is a bit heavy handed in its social commentary. That society can have a pervasive and overwhelming influence on the ultimate destiny of a young person had been developed in the late 19th century by people like Jane Addams, and had become commonplace in the following decades. Many films of the 1930s focused on the importance of providing kids with more positive social influences, like DEAD END and BOY'S TOWN. KNOCK ON ANY DOOR tries to get a lot of mileage out of an idea that was hardly new. During the heavier of the social commentary moments, I kept thinking of a line from Monty Python, when the Church Police arrest a young kid who had murdered a parson. Someone points out in the arrest that society was to blame. ""We'll be arresting him [i.e., society] too.""

Nonetheless, this is an interesting and effective film, though somewhat marred by social sentiment and some serious structural problems in the script.",1244246400,,2687,4.415322580645161
515077,4,6302801133,"Soft-spoken actress Gloria Grahame's sultry voice with Bogie's no-nonsense violent rendition of Dix Steele make for a movie that surprisingly has little to do with the crime drama it proports to portray.

Dix Steele, a hit & miss screenwriter, has a gal come to his place to read a book he was ordered to write a screenplay.  He has her over, she has a ginger ale (she's a swell kid, ya know) and he gives her some money for cab fare.  The next morning she's dead, killed by an unknown assassin.

His only alibi, neighbor Laurel, gets him off, but police suspicions run high.  Soon, she begins do doubt that her lover hasn't actually done it to a point of fear and depression!

Several points to this film: Bogie hates the screenwriter hacks who pump out film after film successfully, bowing to the demands of Hollywood (those damn popcorn factories!).  I can relate.  How many times have we seen plays based on books that were a mere shadow of the author's intentions?

Women in this film notice Dix a lot more than the other way around and often comment on his honest face.  Unfortunately with the face comes a fiery temper that makes people wonder.  Did he do it or didn't he?

Nicholas Ray's use of lighting in this Black & White flick is masterful.  The lights shine on Dix's eyes as someone points him out in the street.  Again, the same intense, crazy light shines as if from his eyes as he dramatizes to his cop friend how the murder may have occurred: ""use your imagination""...and ""take your arm around her neck and squeeze, squeeze the life out of her!""

Cool extras by a film historian and the usual subtitles and scene selections.  Not Bogie's most well-known but definitely well-acted.  Much different than his usual tough-guy approach!

515078,5,6302801133,"IN A LONELY PLACE (1950) may not be one of Humphrey Bogarts better known films, but it certainly contains one of his finest performances.

A restored edition of this film noir classic, directed by Nicholas Ray, has now been released onto DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection.

Bogart plays a Hollywood screenwriter with a quick, often violent temper, who becomes a key suspect when a star-struck hatcheck girl is found murdered. She had been in Bogies apartment earlier in the evening, but had departed, as witnessed by neighbor Gloria Grahame.

A romance develops between Bogart and Grahame, but the fact that he is still under suspicion slowly decimates the relationship, bringing the writers darkest side to the forefront.

Frank Lovejoy co-stars as the investigating detective, an old friend of Bogart.  Also in the cast are Jeff Donnell, Art Smith, Carl Benton Reid and Martha Stewart.

The Criterion offering contains a 2002 retrospective short on IN A LONELY PLACE, featuring director Curtis Hanson, as well as audio commentary by film scholar Dana Polan, a 1975 documentary about Nicholas Ray, a new featurette about Gloria Grahame, a radio adaptation of the original novel upon which the film was adapted and, of course, a booklet on the picture that contains an essay by Imogen Sara Smith.

515080,5,6302801133,"Far and away my favorite Humphrey Bogart movie is the superb film noir, IN A LONELY PLACE (1950).

Bogie is Dixon Steele, a brilliant screenwriter with an unpredictable violent temper who hasn't had a hit film in a decade. Assigned by a producer to transcribe a trash novel, Dix learns that the hatcheck girl at a restaurant where Hollywood insiders gather is familiar with the book, so he invites her home to tell him the story. The resulting interplay between them is the movie's only bit of humor (and it's deftly handled by both).

After becoming annoyed with the girl's run-on description and mispronunciations, Steele wanders over to a window where he observes a negligee-clad woman (Gloria Grahame) who's watching him from a nearby apartment balcony; Dix closes the blinds. He sends the hatcheck girl off with $20 and instructs her to walk around the block to a taxi stand, then he goes to bed.

Steele's awakened at 5 AM by a friend, Det. Sgt. Brub Nikolai (Frank Lovejoy), who wants him to come to HQ for questioning. Under grilling from Capt. Lochner (Carl Reid) Dix is nonchalant when he learns that the girl last seen with him has been found murdered-- tossed from a moving car ""like a cigarette."" The captain suspects Dix is the killer based on his uncaring manner and a long record of assaults (he even broke a producer's jaw).

A witness is called in-- the woman on the balcony: Laurel Gray. She tells the police that she saw the dead girl leave Steele's apartment ALONE-- a lie, as he'd closed the blinds. Released from further questioning, a grateful Dix gives Laurel a ride home. This unusual way of being thrown together leads to the inevitable-- the two fall deeply in love.

Laurel is brought back to police HQ for further questions; Capt. Lochner tells her of his suspicions and warns her to be careful. Steele's later violent explosions make Laurel begin to wonder if maybe her lover DID kill the hatcheck girl?

Bogart and Grahame are absolutely brilliant in this movie. They both display so many emotions: passion, fear, longing, anger, joy, vulnerability, impatience, paranoia, confusion. If you haven't yet experienced ""In a Lonely Place,"" don't hesitate-- it's a truly great picture!

515081,3,6302801133,"There's something darn odd about Nicholas Ray's films. I'm thinking about this one, and Rebel without a Cause. Perhaps it's just that most movies in the 1950s were not much cop. You couldn't really call them good, let alone great. In this one the scaffolding supporting Bogart's performance as Dixon Steele (what a phony name) is quite mediocre, scarcely up to B-movie standard. The script is clunky, the dialogue poor, the second-string acting, especially the completely wooden cops and the ridiculous and permanently drunk thespian, downright ordinary, and the shooting just isn't anything to write home about, in spite of Curtis Hanson's panegyric. However, Bogart's performance is compelling, like Dean's in Rebel. There's something accurate and genuine about his psychology, and the feeling comes across as unusually real. I've known people precisely like this: their own worst enemies; strong tendencies to violence combined with ultra-sensitivity, almost paranoia, whose bizarre behaviour invites suspicion, even though they haven't done anything wrong. Something to do with an extreme egocentricity, and an inability to see things as others see them. This personality dysfunction may also be linked to a certain kind of creativity, but a basically second-rate kind. Bogart carries the story, which is otherwise presented in a very pedestrian and unsubtle manner. In one or two scenes Gloria Grahame just about matches him; although I frankly could never take to her. She always seemed to me highly unattractive-looking, unsexy, and I could never figure out why she got so many high-profile parts. There's no mystery to the plot. In fact, there's no plot at all: the whole thing is a character-study; and there's not one ray of hope for this particular character. Very depressing.",1207526400,3,1787,5.362989323843417

His propensity for violent outbursts are tempered by acts of unexpected generosity.  No wonder the beautiful blond neighbor finds him ""interesting"" and then falls completely in love with him.

Bogart and Grahame are a great match.  Bogart is wonderful, as always and Grahame certainly holds her own with him.  In many ways I found the movie was more about her dilemma than his.  She is the one who has to make the hard decisions.  She is smart, independent and probably lost and  confused enough herself to fall for such a man.  There is great on screen chemistry.  I found the scene at the piano bar where the two of them were obviously enjoying each other, mostly unscripted, quite charming.

515124,5,6302801133,"Nicholas Ray will be cemented in pop culture history, anonymously, as ""the guy who directed REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE."" This is a travesty on two levels: One, REBEL isn't even Ray's best movie (it's only his most famous), and two, because many think that the aching heart came from James Dean's raw performance. While Dean is heart wrenchingly good, REBEL would not have half of its power without Ray, a maverick American director whose best and most personal films would sympathize with the loners and rebels always living by night and outside of conformity. Many critics of Ray's times thought his films were melodramatic and very few were financial successes. However, like all amazing directors, Ray's films were about 20 years ahead of their times--the themes of a man alone and paranoia would become relevant with 70s films such as Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER. Ray saw the future in 1950, and indeed, IN A LONELY PLACE stands the test of time today.

The incomparable Humphrey Bogart plays Dix, a talented but violent and washed-up screenwriter given the dull task of adapting a trashy novel to the screen. Instead of reading the thing, he asks a hatcheck girl to summarize it. The next morning, she is found murdered and Dix is the prime suspect until his cool neighbor Laurel (Gloria Grahame, Ray's estranged wife at the time) clears him. Despite Laurel's guarded demeanor and Dix's deep internal demons, the two fall in love and find inner peace with their blossoming relationship. But their love cannot last long (this wouldn't be a true Nicholas Ray film if everything wrapped up in a nice pink bow), as distrust on Laurel's part and Dix's paranoia due to the ongoing murder investigation threaten their last chance at happiness and love.

Like all amazing movies, IN A LONELY PLACE has so much more than what meets the eye, full of sometimes violently true observations on love and paranoia. This movie had the bad luck of being released the same year as ALL ABOUT EVE and, more famously, SUNSET BLVD., all three scathing looks at celebrity. Although this movie was actually released before the other two, perhaps the subject matter was just too dark--did anybody really want to see Bogart as a potential murderer in a day and age when actors were movie stars first, selling variations of their personas? I'll take this movie any day over Wilder's bizarre satire, because IN A LONELY PLACE is just as scathing but more realistic and more emotionally involving. Dix's disillusionment comes both from the script but also from Ray; a talented director, he was a victim of the studio system and was forced to make projects that are obviously beneath him (indeed, the novel Dix is hired to adapt can be seen as a variation on Ray's ""woman's picture"" BORN TO BE BAD, which bears little of his fingerprints), and even his personal project ON DANGEROUS GROUND was cut up by Howard Hughes and slapped on with an uncharacteristic happy ending. This film can be seen as a thesis on a system that is only interested in selling popcorn over making something personal, which is what made Ray so appealing, and what solidified his status as an auteur.

Off-screen, both Ray and Bogart were vehemently against the HUAC Communist witch hunts (Ray would further develop this theme with JOHNNY GUITAR), and the murder investigation and the tension it causes is an obvious--and, in 1949, early--allegory for the Red Scare. Instead of dating this movie further, it only enriches its effectiveness. After all, we live in a post-9/11 world where we accept the fact that surveillance and spying is a part of everyday life, and fear leads to violence, the violence to destruction and loss.

Movie stars of the Golden Era are so often passed over in favor of Method Actors such as Marlon Brando, which is more than unfair. Imagine Brando doing what Bogart did in CASABLANCA with the same coolness and mystery. Bogart spent nearly 10 years forming his persona of the cynical but emotionally bruised anti-hero, and starting with TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE he started tearing it down. You can almost see the tough facade cracking under the pressure, revealing an undeniable vulnerability. It's hard to think of how many actors of any era could pull this off, making us root for a potentially murderous man, even when we don't entirely trust him. The movie never illuminates what makes Dix so violent, never showing the roots of his internal demons. There are only subtle clues dropped; we know that Dix is a war veteran. His faithful agent Mel tells Laurel in a moment of doubt that Dix, whom he's known for 20 years, has a violent streak that is as a part of him ""as the color of his eyes or the shape of his head."" And it is this ambiguity that is also the glory of the movie; there is no flashback to a troubled childhood or combat duty. For all we know, Dix could've been like this his whole life. Bogart, through impeccable body language, shows us how his creativity and passion lies right next door to his exploding temper--even as he professes his love for Laurel, his hands possess her neck as if he is ready to strangle her, a foreshadowing to the pessimistic climax. He shows us that Dix's very temperament stems from his insecurities and very human desire for love. You feel the heaviness of Dix's emotional baggage, and never before was Bogart more world-weary and exhausted in a movie. Never again would he come this close to a complete performance.

Between Bogart's real life wife Lauren Bacall in THE BIG SLEEP and (Katharine) Hepburn in THE AFRICAN QUEEN, there were few great Bogart love interests (the husky Lizabeth Scott is a poor man's Bacall), but Gloria Grahame is a revelation and gives the role a worldliness that Bacall could never have alluded to. In a role clearly meant for Bacall, Grahame more than makes a great Laurel, a woman at once strong, vulnerable, guarded and sly. She and Bogart make an amazing duo, regularly passing witty comebacks, then slowly seeing the distrust and insecurities in each other. She and Nicholas Ray quietly separated during filming; this movie is a testament to their professionalism under a tough situation. In a role that relieves her of playing the lovable floozy, this may also be Grahame's best performance.

While all three are known for bigger movies (Ray went on to direct REBEL while Grahame and Bogart would go on to win Oscars), their professional peak may have been this gem. It is because of the actors' trust in Ray that he was able to craft such deep performances, and their own bravery to play such flawed yet real characters that we remember--and still root for--Dix and Laurel's tragically doomed love affair in which nobody walks away a free man and humans are prisoners of their own fate.

The opening stop-light confrontation scene was familiar, but seriously, I don't believe Bogie as a physical, tough guy like when I was a kid.  Look at how tiny his torso is when he's not wearing a jacket! He looked great in a tailored jacket. His wardrobe here looks just like his off-screen Hollywood night-club style you can see in all the bios about him.(Cagney really was tough! When he worked with the Dead-end Kids,he didn't take any crap off them the way Bogie did on the CRIME SCHOOL set.) The scene where he beats up a healthy looking young college guy half his age is ludicrous.

Otherwise the plot and pacing are dreadfully slow, and the other actors are more nostalgic than convincing since they were mostly in film noir movies. Frank Lovejoy as the cop buddy was interesting.  Especially with the presumably Russian sur-name 'Nikolai.'  The only other movie I can recall Lovejoy being in wasn't 'I WAS A COMMUNIST FOR THE FBI' where his name was 'Cvetic.' In reality, I'm pretty sure he was Irish.  Gloria Grahame was good in a part that wasn't written very well.  Jeff Donnell was interesting to watch as Lovejoy's wife.

515142,5,6302801133,"Nicholas Ray's ""In a Lonely Place"" (1950) owes most of its suspense to the same gradual revelations that characterized Hitchcock's ""Sabotage"" and Lang's ""Fury"". All three films concern a woman's slow realization that her husband, fiance, boyfriend is a monster. Shortly after moving into a new apartment, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) discovers a mutual attraction between herself and neighbor Dixon ""Dix"" Steele (Humphrey Bogart).

Their actual introduction is at police headquarters where successful screenwriter Dix is being questioned regarding his relationship with Mildred Atkinson (Martha Stewart), a ""hat-check"" girl who had visited Dix in his apartment a few hours before her murder. Laurel is able to supply an alibi, having spotted Mildred leaving the apartment alone.

Dix is unmotivated but takes on a new project, adapting a novel for a producer who intends to make it into a movie. His romance with Laurel is a great tonic and he works hard on this screenplay. Early on the viewer learns that Dix is subject to fits of temper and rage, and needs little provocation to become completely unglued. But the viewer also sees his good qualities, he quickly comes to the defense of an older actor who has a drinking problem and does not take advantage of young Mildred during her late night visit to his apartment.

Despite his alibi, the police continue to suspect Dix of Mildred's murder; mostly because of his past history of violence. Brub Nicolai (Frank Lovejoy), an old war buddy and now a police detective, defends him and even has him over for dinner; although Brub's wife thinks that Dix has serious psychological problems.

The remainder of the story is told from Laurel's point-of-view. The two fall in love but as Dix's issues begin to manifest themselves she begins to wonder if he might actually be the murderer. He knows a little too much about the murder and rather oddly isn't angry about being a suspect, while his increasingly erratic behavior in other areas begins to terrify her.

In both ""Sabotage"" and ""Fury"" the good girl role was played very effectively by Sylvia Sidney, whose considerable acting for the camera skills allowed her to nonverbally convey her character's growing suspicion and eventual realization that a man she once trusted has a dangerous hidden side. Grahame's performance is not as nuanced but is still quite effective. Best remembered for her comedic role as Ado Annie in ""Oklahoma"", she was well suited to this type of airhead role (in the tradition of Una Merkel and Zasu Pitts).  Yet she had considerable range as a serious actress, which she demonstrated here and again in ""The Big Heat"".

Bogart's Dix is a precursor of his Captain Quig character in ""The Caine Mutiny"". But Dix has considerably more dimensions and Bogart alternates between his standard ""tough but basically good"" loner and the disturbed Quig. This multi-dimensionality makes him very real and ultimately sympathetic as the viewer comes to realize that the title's ""lonely place"" is inside Dix's mind.

""In a Lonely Place"" is a bit different than classic film noir. It is considerably more powerful and disturbing because the standard film noir murder element is of minimal importance. Instead Ray concentrates on making the viewer really care about his characters, hoping that Laurel's love will continue to transform Dix and so that he will eventually find a way to cope with his inner demons.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1166313600,3,3467,5.036649214659686

Grahame plays a neighbour who turns into both alibi and lover when a Bogart takes home a girl who is later killed.  The plot is hokey, but the movie is worthwhile for its sharp observatons of Hollywood life and the nascent chemistry between Bogart and Grahame.  Not Bogart's best, but Grahame's strong performance made me want to see more of her movies.  Nonetheless, it's totally watchable and quite gripping.

515144,5,6302801133,"There's a lonely place in the heart of bipolar screenwriter Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart). He has tried to fill it with booze and by surrounding himself with weak and absolvitory personalities called friends. But the void is still there -- until he is questioned for the murder of a woman he took home the prior evening.

From the opening scene, it is apparent that Dixon has a temper. Frequently, his extended fingers are around someone's neck, fists are pummeling someone's face, or his sharp tongue is cutting someone's dignity. The lengthy assault rap sheet makes him prime suspect in the murder investigation. His insolent attitude doesn't win any mercy.

Fortunately, an airtight alibi walks out of the interrogation room and into his lonely place. ""I was born when she kissed me."" Neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) elevates him from his writer's rut and inspires hope and joy. Initially blind to his imperfections, she begins to have second thoughts about the whirlwind relationship after Dixon erupts into a volcano before her very eyes. Then she begins to fear for her own life.

Leaving a volatile and possessive Dixon is not as easy as hopping on the next plane. ""I died when she left me"" is a line from his most recent script inspired by the love of his life. ""I lived a few weeks while she loved me,"" the quote continues. Will the two find happiness in marriage or will she be found strangled in A LONELY PLACE like the girl before her?

Bogie plays Dixon Steele, a screenwriter trying to make a comeback after the war - and after he's distanced himself from the studio heads with his erratic and violent behavior. He finally gets a break and is asked to adapt a romance novel for the screen; he hates the book and tells off the producer, slugging him. A hatcheck girl (played by Martha Stewart) at Bogie's club hangout offers to help Bogart out with the book and goes home with him. Later Stewart is found dead and Bogie is the prime suspect. But neighbor Gloria Grahame, who falls in love with Bogie, has seen Stewart leave his place alone the night she was killed - yet she's also witnessed his violent tantrums and soon doesn't know what to think. And that's the beauty of the picture as director Nicholas Ray develops the story so that we, the audience, soon don't know what to think, either. Our emotions sway back and forth over Bogart's guilt right to the end. The script is taut and powerful, and all the principal actors put in excellent performances.

Movie screen-writer Dixon Steele  retorts:  ""When they get to be big stars, they usually do"". This 2003 DVD was quietly released in 2003, without any fanfare. There should have been some.  Nicholas Ray's powerful direction of 1950's ""In A Lonely Place"" is a gaunt inspection of ""inside Hollywood"", complete with ruthless studio bosses, boozy actors on-the-skids, and one motion picture screen-writer who's fed up with it all.  Dixon Steele meets a young girl at his favorite restaurant, and invites her home to read a story he's considering adapting for a movie. The girl is pretty, but it's just business to him.  She's seen leaving his Hollywood apartment by his quiet neighbor, Laurel.  When the girl is found murdered the next day, the police naturally want to talk to the bad-tempered, wild-living Dixon Steele. Did he fly-off-the-handle again, and knock off the girl?  Humphrey Bogart stars as Dixon Steele.  Flush from success in the late 1940's, Bogart had set-up his own film production company, Santana Productions, and was releasing movies through Columbia. In this period, Santana made three films in a row.  Two were real stinkers, but ""In A Lonely Place"" is now film classic.  Humphrey Bogart, still in his prime, had perhaps the role of a lifetime. Yes, he was great in ""Casablanca"", but here, as Steele, nothing is held back. Like Bogart himself, the character of Steele is acerbic, raw, and violent.  A brawler in real life, Bogart wasn't afraid to illuminate his darker side in a gutsy portrayal of a neurotic, almost psychotic reprobate.  Ray's direction is flawless, and this is his finest work(It's even better than his marvelous ""Rebel Without A Cause"").  His wife(at the time) Gloria Grahame co-stars as Laurel, the neighbor.  A fine cast includes Robert Warwick, Frank Lovejoy, Morris Ankrum, Myron Healey, and in a small part, Jack Webb. The DVD is spotless, with a Dolby Digital 2.0 track. Extras include ""In A Lonely Place Revisited"", a featurette on restoration, and a Bogart photo montage. Just a few years later, Bogart's health would decline, and meaty roles would become somewhat rare.  But here, just before that happened, is an electrifying performance by a motion picture icon at the top of his game.  A quality DVD,a great story, and amazing multi-level theater. I think I'm going to watch it all again.",1140739200,3,2425,5.007481296758105
515148,4,6302801133,"Nicholas Ray's ""In a Lonely Place"" is one of the strangest films ever released by a major Hollywood studio. It asks us to invest our sympathy in Dixon Steele, a gifted but violent-tempered screenwriter whose salient trait is his total inability to tolerate any sort of insult or contradiction, no matter how minor. Columbia Pictures advertised this as a mystery, but it's a mystery of a very special sort: We know from the beginning--as does his neighbor and soon-to-be lover Laurel Grey--that Steele gave Mildred Atkinson $20 for a taxi and sent her home, so he couldn't have been responsible when she turned up dead a few hours later. Yet Steele's subsequent behavior is so weird and brutal--and his past history of violence so damning--that we start having the same doubts as Laurel. Could Steele have changed his mind and followed Mildred? Could Mildred have forgotten something, come back, and said or done something to set off Steele's notorious temper? Ricocheting off this main story are all sorts of unspoken questions: Even if Steele is innocent, is he a perp-in-waiting, a psychopath who simply hasn't gotten around to committing a murder just yet? And how much leeway should we give to geniuses who consistently exhibit anti-social behavior? In any case, it took a great deal of courage for Ray to ask us to spend time with Steele, and even more for Humphrey Bogart to play him. There were parallels (unfortunately) between Steele and Bogart's own volatile personality; indeed, Bogart's own company, Santana Productions, produced this film. Whether Bogart intended this film as apology or apologia, he gives one of his most subtle and heartfelt performances here, deftly mingling his trademark charm and charisma with terrifying eruptions of anger. Gloria Grahame, exhibiting the bruised, hard-bitten innocence that made her such a compelling actress, is the perfect match for Bogart. There are similarities between ""In a Lonely Place"" and Hitchcock's ""Suspicion,"" but ""In a Lonely Place"" is the movie that got the story right: Ray and Bogart both understood that no happy endings could ensue from such a story. Above all, they understood that, if you're very unlucky, you end up being your own destiny.",1137110400,2,2215,5.104683195592287

She will be found dead and consequently he will arouse even without wishing it, the immediate suspicion. His alluring neighbor (the exquisite Gloria Grahame) will defend him alleging she saw the woman leaving his apartment alone.

They will fall in love but once again, his unstoppable character will be building an invisible barrier between them, when she begins to suspect if she was wrong to protect him.

Nicholas Ray had a clinical eye for those dark personages and bleak future. Think in the dramatis personae around Bitter Victory, for instance. The weight of the guilty and the excesses derived from it are a perpetual mobile. Moreover they are unconsciously instigator factors, that even affect and determine future miscarried behavior patterns around them, as we will realize in Rebel without a cause

But the inner world of the characters is another subject to analyze. Their lives are surrounded of dark clouds and that works out as a true barrier who isolates them respect the outer world, condemning them beforehand.

515150,3,6302801133,"For me, perhaps the strongest thing about this film is that it realistically portrays a man with a violent temper.  That's worth something.  We all know people like that, and most of us are occasionally like that ourselves, hopefully not on too many occasions.

Here's an example of what I consider the artistry of this film.  A contrite Bogart is promising never to lose it again.  We, the audience, know that he can't possibly keep that promise.  Within minutes he loses it.

We feel his controlling nature.  It's like we are in the room with it.  It's good for a film to reflect back to us such a common aspect of human nature.

The reason I'm not giving this five stars is that I didn't find it an enjoyable or uplifting movie.  It didn't reach my heart.  It is unfortunate that the Bogart character is so messed up.  Do you really enjoy, for example, watching a drunken bum stagger down a city street?  Yes it is a part of reality, but it doesn't reach your heart, doesn't uplift you.

I'd compare the distastefulness of watching a pathetic bum staggering around to the distastefulness of watching the Bogart character in this film exhibiting his personality disorder.  It's not pleasant to be around.

As for the murder mystery itself, I solved that as soon as I heard who was killed.  I knew who the culprit was as soon as he first appeared onscreen, just for a moment.  It was a no-brainer, and I'm surprised the cops didn't see it as such.  Who murders a girl?  Who is almost always the culprit?  Please, it's obvious.

This is a good movie.  I don't think it's a great one.  Bogart has starred in greater movies than this.  It is what it is.",1126051200,5,1651,4.474747474747475

Bogart invites a coat check girl, who has read the book he is to write a script for, to his apartment to discuss it.  Being tired due to the late hour, he dismisses her giving her money for a cab.  When she is found the next morning murdered, Bogart, with a long history of violent episodes, is considered the prime suspect.

Bogart's neighbor Laurel Gray played by a sultry Gloria Grahame supplies an alibi for him, having seen the girl leave Bogart's apartment alone.  The investigating cop Captain Lochner remains suspicious.  Lochner's underling Sgt. Nicolai, played by Frank Lovejoy, is a buddy of Bogart's and doubts his guilt.

Grahame and Bogart are attracted to each other and commence a romance.  Her attention inspires his creativity and he begins to write prolifically.  While they are together Bogart manages to fly off the handle on numerous occassions.  She begins to fear Bogart, putting a strain on their fragile relationship.  Her dread forces her to reconsider whether Bogart might be guilty of the crime.  When he proposes marriage Grahame is too frightened to decline.

The perceptive Bogart sensing Grahame's apprehension, attacks her when he finds out the truth, effectively destroying the relationship.  Ironically his friend Sgt. Nicolai has been attempting to track him down to tell him that the real murderer has confessed.

Nicholas Ray directs a dark, foreboding drama which effectively portrays an individual with deep seated emotional problems.  Bogart's character Dixon Steele is a conflicted soul with an unextinguishable rage which unfortunately incinerates those that care the most about him.

515193,5,6302801133,"Humphrey Bogart plays Dixon Steele, a once successful Hollywood screenplay writer who hasn't had a hit for a while.  He's asked to adapt a book to a screenplay, a job that he regards with some arrogant scorn, and in the process invites home a young hatcheck girl who has the book.  Shortly afterwards, she's found dead, and not surprisingly, he's the number one suspect.  And no wonder!  He has a history of violent outbursts -- bar fights, domestic conflicts, that sort of thing but has somehow escaped doing time for it.  He's also a WWII veteran (is that the source of his outbursts of rage?) and one of the police investigating the case served under him in the war.  Dix gets involved with his alibi -- a woman in the same apartment complex who says she saw the woman leave alive.  She falls in love with him but is increasingly troubled by what she sees.

I am amazed at reviews who say this is about the effect that the police investigation has on their relationship.  I don't see it that way at all -- I see it as a woman discovering that the man she is falling for has a big anger management problem.  One is left to ponder why it takes her as long as it does to realize how bad this problem is, and to consider -- based on what she sees of him at his worst -- the possibility that he did indeed kill the hatcheck girl.  You're left until the end before you know whether or not he's guilty.

This movie is less well known than it ought to be.  Yes, it's in B & W and very much a period piece, but the themes are still relevant and this movie could be the basis for a good discussion on men with rage and violence issues.  This is not, by the way, your typical noir murder mystery -- this is much more a critique of the antiheroes of this genre.",1114992000,,1752,4.206586826347305
515194,5,6302801133,"Bogart reportedly thought the movie a failure. Certainly box-office results were dismal and Bogie's production company, Santana, lost a bundle. Hard to believe anyone thought this disturbing film with its downbeat ending would actually make money. Bogart's Dix Steel (that name should have been reconsidered) is a borderline psychopath, a Jekyll and Hyde who can boil over in an instant. He's a walking volcano whose sensitive side simply cannot contain the inner turmoil. In that day, few Hollywood egos had the assurance to take on such an unflattering role, especially the shadowy later scenes where his creviced face approaches the grotesque. It's a fine and daring performance, and the last, I believe, where Bogart plays even a semi- romantic leading man.

Good as Bogart is, this is a Gloria Graham showcase. Her droopy upper lip and pouty face never quite fit the Hollywood mold, and by decade's end, she was gone. Here, however, she's near perfect as the jaded starlet, with a questionable background and just a hint of 50's kink. Her Laurel Gray emerges as a vulnerable, yet street-wise toughie, drawing the eager Steel into a torrid affair, (only hinted at because of the production code of the day). But as his character unravels, so must hers, which it does in beautifully understated stages. Watch her quietly desperate reaction to Steel following the assault on the motorist, or her barely controlled panic at film's end. It's an award-level performance, all the better for refusing to go over the top, despite the many opportunities. Small wonder she remains an enduring noir favorite.

The mystery angle may be a clever plot device, but it's director Nicholas Ray's powerful vision that makes the film gel. A poet of post-war alienation, he's the perfect overseer of such fare, combining the elements into a grimly compelling view of human estrangement and isolation. Perhaps no director other than Elia Kazan could work with a cast as effectively as Ray. Notice how distinctively each of the supporting players is drawn, from the Shakespearean drunk to the hard-bitten maid to the lounge lizards at Romanoff's. Only the cops in routine roles seem to fade into the background. Unerrated in many of Ray's best films is the scoring, and this film is no exception. George Antheil's compositions are simple yet expertly conceived, highlighting the scenes without rivaling them and lending just the right emotional tone. My one complaint: I've never understood why an industry so close to the beach couldn't film at the beach, or at least couldn't have come up with a better process shot than the one here.

Nonetheless Bogart was wrong. The film is anything but a failure. Coming from an era of happy endings, Dix and Laurel remain star-crossed lovers, doomed by their own sophistication and inner demons, for which there appears no cure. Expecting uplift, audiences of the day may not have responded, but viewers during the years between have, recognizing In a Lonely Place for the noir classic it is. This quietly disturbing portrayal of one man's inability to cope continues to resonate beyond the confines of today's slam-bang world. So whatever you do, don't miss it.",1111363200,3,3185,5.062857142857143
515195,5,6302801133,"Hot-tempered, uncompromising screenwriter Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart) hasn't been able to write a successful script in years. When he's asked to adapt a popular novel, Dix invites an enthusiastic young hatcheck girl (Martha Stewart) who has read the book to tell him about it. She cancels a date for the chance to explain the novel to the famous screenwriter, and he's happy not to have to read the book. But Dix is summoned to the police station for questioning the next day, because the young woman was murdered shortly after leaving his apartment. A neighbor, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), who saw Dix the night before from her balcony, verifies that the murder victim left Dix's apartment alone. But Dix remains the police's prime suspect, as he and Laurel fall in love. Although she loves Dix, his controlling, violent personality eventually cause Laurel to distrust him, and then to suspect that he may be guilty of murder, after all.

""In a Lonely Place"" is loosely based on the novel by Dorothy B. Hughes and is wonderfully reflexive in that Dixon Steele adapts a novel in the film, which he alters dramatically for his purposes. Edmund H. North, who adapted ""In a Lonely Place"", departed radically from Hughes' novel and completely rewrote the Dix character. Dixon Steele is a typical film noir protagonist in that he falls victim to his own character flaw: his violent and controlling nature. ""In a Lonely Place"" is a ""Hollywood insider"" film that takes place in and around the filmmaking industry and presents an unflattering view of the industry's motives and the audience's tastes. Even Burnett Guffey's ""sunny California"" cinematography is dark. Dix is to some extent made a heroic figure within this environment by his stubbornness -a writer with integrity trying to do good work in an industry of ""popcorn salesman"". Director Nicholas Ray is masterful at manipulating the audience's sympathies from Dix to Laurel and back again. When we are sympathetic to Dix, he frustrates the audience by being his own worst enemy. When he is callous and volatile, we wonder if he committed the crime. Ultimately, ""In a Lonely Place"" is about the corrosive effects of distrust and suspicion. Humphrey Bogart achieves true acting greatness with his complex performance, which is one of the most memorable of his career.

The DVD: Bonus features include 2 documentaries, a sort of retrospective of Bogart's career, and trailers for ""In a Lonely Place"", ""The Lady from Shanghai"", and ""The Big Heat"". ""In a Lonely Place Revisited"" (20 minutes) is hosted by director Curtis Hanson. Speaking from the courtyard of the hacienda-style apartment community where Dix and Laurel lived in the film, Hanson talks about various aspects of the film, including the director, actors, characters, and the collaboration between director Nicholas Ray and Humphrey Bogart that produced such an emotionally honest performance. He also contrasts the film and the book on which it was based. Commentary is illustrated with film clips. ""In a Lonely Place: Restoration Story"" (5 minutes) is an interesting look at the process of restoring the film from its original, very battered, cellulose nitrate film stock. Includes interviews with Sony's Vice President of Asset Management, Grover Crisp, the folks at Cinetech who restored the film images, and the folks at Chase Productions who restored the film's sound.

Adapted from a pulp novel about a serial killer, the film veers widely from its original source: the murder mystery that sets it off fades very quickly to the background, as the film becomes much more about the volatile relationship between the abusive but romantic screenwriter played by Bogart and the woman he loves (Gloria Grahame, in a very fine performance that makes much of her odd combination of flowerlike beauty and tough will). The film's searching exploration of raw emotions combined with its complex use of mise-en-scene only partially obscures the fact that Bogart's performance is quite erratic. Although believably incensed in the final scene, he seems too bored and tired to  be credible driving his car at high speed in a fury or beating up a star football player. Moreover, the initial scenes with Bogart and the murder victim seem from another movie altogether, and you feel cheated when the likeable murder victim turns out to be so irrelevant to the story.

But this is a film rich in such moments - including the apparently obligatory night club singing scene which was a cliche of the forties films - with the excellent singing performance interrupted by the enraged Dixon Steele (Bogart) as he physically attacks HIS BESPECTACLED BEST FRIEND AND AGENT at his table.  Personally I find this film superior to REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.  It is especially well written by Andrew Solt and Mr Ray gets fabulous performances out of all concerned.  It is at the one time a film self deprecating about its own medium as an art - much irony within the film about the cliches of film - as well as a searing comment on post traumatic stress as the character played by Mr Bogart is clearly a victim of war.

515198,5,6302801133,"IN A LONELY PLACE is a brilliant film from director Nicholas Ray. Humphrey Bogart with his usual cragged-faced presence dominates the screen once again. This time he is a man totally introverted and obsessed with some hidden lack of ability to express his own compassion and humanity. Bogart plays an elusive Hollywood screenwriter named Dixon Steele that becomes the focus of a police investigation of a murder in this atmospheric and unsettling film. What makes the film so unsettling is Bogart's performance. He is a very enigmatic, private and tired man who at times seems so detached from reality that it is frightening. Yet Bogart in this role still posses a virile and cynical coolness of style that is so appealing and it is one that only he can pull off with his screen charisma bringing this character to reality and believability.
In the film Bogart lives in a complex of courtyard apartments. The police investigation interferes with a relationship that Bogart has with Gloria Grahame who lives in the same complex. Bogart comes to be intrigued (and visa versa) by her and truly falls in love with her. Yet it is the police investigation that continues to intensify Bogart's inner struggle as a human being with his need to love and be loved and escalates his volatile and violent outbursts which confuse and distance Grahame from him.
IN A LONELY PLACE examines such human qualities and frailties of love, trust and loyalty. It explores and exposes the effects of our interpretations, perceptions and misconceptions and ultimately demonstrates that our own human flaws can lead to perpetual loneliness of the heart if left unchecked.

It's brilliant give and take, literary musings with tough guy and gal repertoire. Gloria Graham is no piker either. She is the beautiful actress, but there is no doubt she loves Dixon Steele the screenwriter and comes to fear him too. I can't imagine another actress of this period pulling off this love story. And we get Bogart in love, a tough, and maybe psychotic guy in love. His manliness is counterpoint to his unprotected psyche. Also homage should be paid to Nicholas Ray's direction.

515200,5,6302801133,"Nicholas Ray's film noir is a departure for Humphrey Bogart and for the film noir genre itself.
Dixon Steele (Humphrey Bogart), a washed-up screenwriter with a flashpoint temper and a violent streak, is equal parts Rick Blaine and Fred C. Dobbs. Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) is the antithesis of the dumb blonde.
The script by Andrew Solt from Dorothy B. Hughes's novel has all the crisp, Chandleresque dialogue of the best film noir but with an emotional intensity not usually associated with the genre. The film works better as a romance between two damaged people than as a crime drama. George Antheil's score works wonders at underscoring their anguish.
Dix's agent Mel Lippmann (Art Smith) asks the old hack to dinner to consider adapting a Harlequinesque romance novel that hack director Lloyd Barnes (Morris Ankrum) is eager to shoot. On the way to the restaurant Dix nearly gets into a fight with a passing motorist and upon arrival at the bar DOES mix it up with some sonofaproducer who calls Dix's old buddy Charlie (Robert Warwick) the washed-up drunkard actor that he is.
The semiliterate coat check girl Mildred Atkinson (Martha Stewart) gushes about the novel that Dix is up for adapting, so rather than read it, Dix invites her to his apartment to tell him the story. She has to break a date with her boyfriend to do so but as Dix says, ""There's no sacrifice too great for a chance at immortality.""
When one of Dix's old war-buddies-turned-police-detective Brub Nicolai (Frank Lovejoy) pays Dix a visit at 5 a.m., he thinks it's because the producer's son filed a complaint. He's wrong. The coat check girl has been murdered and thrown in a ditch.
Dix's best defence is new neighbor Laurel Gray who saw the girl leave Dix's apartment alone. Dix falls for Laurel because she has a nice face. But she's a little more cautious.
DIXON STEELE: Go ahead and get some sleep and we'll have dinner together tonight.
LAUREL GRAY: We'll have dinner tonight. But not together.
There are plenty of laughs supplied by Art Smith, Robert Warwick, and Ruth Warren as the cleaning lady who can never get either Dix's or Laurel's apartment clean.
At its core, though, IN A LONELY PLACE is about two lonely people who clearly need but will not allow themselves to have each other.",1076630400,,2275,4.791348600508906

515232,4,6302801133,"""In a Lonely Place"" is widely considered to be one of the best of the film noir genre, but I can't quite bring myself to give it noir status.  It certainly has the ambiguity, sense of paranoia and seedy underworld setting of the standard noir, but it's also lacking in a few crucial elements that in my opinion give a film noir its noir: the femme fatale, the sense of underlying corruption. When Gloria Grahame first slinks her away across the screen, you think ""Ah ha! Here's our femme fatale."" But she's not, and this is only one instance of the way this film unpredictably turns the audience's expectations upside down.
The film is very unusual in the way it tells its story.  Bogart plays a struggling screen writer suspected of murdering a young, star-struck girl.  We know he hasn't done it, and we expect the film to be about the unraveling of the mystery surrounding her death in Bogie's attempts to prove his innocence.  But that's not at all what we get.  The murder is forgotten, never very important to begin with, and the film settles into a character study of Bogie, not concerned so much with whether or not he committed a murder but rather with whether or not he has the CAPACITY to commit murder. The cool, unflappable persona that greets us at the beginning of the movie (the Bogie we're used to), deteriorates into a paranoid, jealous, nearly psychotic loner by the film's end, and Gloria Grahame (who we early on suspected of having some devious aims) becomes our chief object of concern.  The movie is all over the place in a good way, truly surprising and fresh.
The title of course refers to the lonely place of the interior psyche, and the demons that can haunt a man who has too much time with himself.  Bogie spends so much time in the imaginary worlds he creates for his screenplays, that he can't seem to deal any longer with the reality of the material world around him, or maintain relationships that don't rely on his bullying his way into getting what he wants.  And the saddest thing is that he knows this about himself.  It's a great display of acting on Bogie's part and a neat deconstruction of the Bogie screen persona.
Enjoy.

515233,1,6302801133,"In the seventies Ray couldn't get work, so film buffs began to think that he was a rebel.  He also wore an eyepatch, and eyepatch directors are always cool, aren't they?  Lang, Ford, Walsh, de Toth.  Cool.  This Ray guy?  Nah.

This one mainly offends by its dullness.  Slow, mushy, unstructured, cursed by a pillowy and nonstop score by George Antheil, free of any menace or suspense or villainy.

Bogart is accused of some crime or other and spends the rest of the movie futzing around his apartment. The neighbor girl, Gloria Grahame, falls for him but begins to question if he's really as innocent as he seems.  That's all she does is question; she doesn't do much of anything about it.

This is one heck of a talky film.

As the cops - none of whom can boast even one personality trait among them -  lackadaisically pursue their meandering investigation, Bogart and Grahame sit around and talk about not much of anything.  The seconds tick by.  The viewer listens to the tuneless score.  The cleaning lady comes in and asks to vacuum.  A washed up silent film star makes several unsuccessful bids for audience sympathy.  (I wish he'd been the one who was murdered.)  Bogart makes the dull cop act out the murder and Ray shines a little light into his face, I guess because he'd been impressed by Detour five years earlier.  Time passes... The viewer realizes that since Bogart produced the thing himself he's not likely to be a bad guy anyway so what are we waiting around for?  More time passes...  ""It's as much a part of him as the color of his eyes, or the shape of his head.""  That one jolts you awake: the shape of his head?!?!  What's that supposed to mean?  We go droningly onwards...  The cop mentions the investigation has been going on for three weeks, and the snarky viewer says ""So, it's filmed in real time then?""  More of the lush score; sounds like the Jackie Gleason Orchestra.  More dullness.  Silent-film-actor-dude recites Shakespeare, though there's not much call for a silent film actor to have memorized Shakespeare, now is there.  Drip... Drip...  Drip... Like sands through an hourglass... The viewer reaches for the gin bottle with trembling hand.

I dunno if  this is the worst film in Ray's unimpressive oeuvre - after all he made a lot of bad films - but I do know that except for Sirocco it's the worst film in Bogart's.  Actually, Sirocco got itself quoted in a Dylan song one time, so Lonely Place wins the Razzie by a nose.

If you want to see the cast in movies that don't stink so bad you have to open all your windows to air out the place, then see Gloria Grahame in The Big Heat, Art Smith in Brute Force, Robert Warwick in Silver Lode.  If you want a truly great and underrated example of late Bogart, check out his final picture The Harder They Fall.",1061769600,15,2794,4.52
515234,2,6302801133,"The starbright status of Humphrey Bogart, Gloria Grahame, and Frank Lovejoy fails to carry this crater-filled tale of a woman's worries about the propensity to violence of her beloved.  The narrative rises to a promising start with a mysterious murder to which Bogart seems marginally linked, but then the story wanes straightaway into a muddled exploration of his erratic behavior.  And given the shaky, shifty ground on which psychology now rests, this study looks like primeval ooze!  Is Bogie mentally deranged, artistically tempermental, viciously manipulative, or what?  There's never a clear answer, and, given forties/fifties chauvinism, Grahame apparently assumes it's okay if her man roughs up women or bops proteges-- just as long as he's not capable of murder!  And there's nothing in the plotline to elucidate her motivations or calculations.  There are so many sinkholes in the story that the film seems clumsily overedited.  When Bogart and Grahame first meet, they almost immediately make moon-eyes.  Next, they're viewed in a writer/secretary relationship that appears almost chaste.  He's not paying her, so how is she supporting herself?  And what's this about a former lover?  Or is that superfluous masseuse her lover?

If we were not told of the restoration efforts, you would not imagine any were done:  there are still plenty of scratchy, dull scenes, and on my disk, and one digital break-up.

515237,2,6302801133,"Nicholas Ray's ""In A Lonely Place"" is one of those eternally compelling film noirs that haunts you once you've seen it. Bogart is screenwriter, Dixon Steele. He's got a terrible temper that doesn't make him popular either amongst the studio big shots or his nightclubbing buddies. But has that uncontrollable rage led him to kill? Det. Sgt. Brub Nicholai (Frank Lovejoy) and Capt. Lochner (Carl Benton Reid) seem to think so. Dix' is their prime suspect in the homicide of a cocktail waitress. Of course it doesn't help that she was a guest at Steele's home the very night that she disappeared. Apart from its initial focus on murder, the bulk of this film is a moody melodrama buttressed by an impossible romance.
As is his trademark, Bogie plays Dix' as the brooding outsider but with an undercarriage of wicked cynicism that, at times, can be quite unsettling. Gloria Grahame costars as Bogie's sultry neighbor, Laurel Gray. At first believing Dix's innocence she embarks upon an ill-fated relationship, against both her better judgment and the advice of her meddling masseur, Martha (Ruth Gilette). Director Nicholas Ray keeps the tension taut yet supple, manipulating his audience with the proverbial ""did he or didn't he"" question ever looming in the back of our minds until the final fade out. But the film suffers somewhat from an inconsistent commitment to its many plot threads which never add up to a satisfactory conclusion in the end. Instead we are given a series of vignettes - - some feeling as though they belong to another movie - - and then a truncated conclusion which appears more the tack on after three or four viewings.

I'm not sure what the term ""complete digital restoration"" means over at Columbia Studios. When I think in those terms flashes of Paramount's ""Sunset Blvd."" or Warner's ""Mildred Pierce"" immediately come to mind. But when Columbia uses it, as they do in their 'restoration snippet trailer' included on this disc, they merely mean that they've digitally repaired some of the glaring rips and tears in the original camera negative. That's not complete and it's not even close to what a film like ""In A Lonely Place needs. Throughout this often low contrasted B&W image, there is an excessive amount of film grain, dirt, scratches and, on occasion, aliasing and shimmering of fine details. Night scenes are worse off than day scenes, showing signs of rear projection photography that are extremely grainy and sometimes even out of focus. Indoor and day scenes on the whole fare better. But hey, this is film noir and often grit and grain go hand in glove.  The audio is nicely balanced but again, needs more clean up to bring it up to acceptable levels for DVD release.

As far as extras, we get a feeble ""making of"" featurette and a really lousy ""The Bogart Collection"" montage that shows us stills from all the films Bogie made at Columbia, but not a single film clip, presumably because the footage is just so bad in terms of its deterioration of the original camera negative and film stock. It's such a shame that the regime at Columbia that was responsible for earlier efforts in the B&W classics dept. have either been fired or departed for greener pastures as their exemplary efforts are nowhere to be found on the studio's recent batch of lack luster transfers, of which ""In A Lonely Place"" is but one!",1048723200,31,3350,4.822608695652174

How about a little documentary on the stars, the directors, etc.  Something.  Either that or make the price twelve bucks instead of double that.  Also, what is the quality of the sound and picture, have they cleaned that up?  This is highway robbery from a bunch of people who are constantly berating us for complaining about taxes or whatever, while they're living in half a dozen houses around the world and driving around Los Angeles in a mobile home so they don't have to share restrooms with the rest of us peasants (Barbra Streisand), all the while telling us we're supporting terrorism by driving SUVs.  But I digress, the bottom line is that while this may be a great movie, it is overpriced for its age (after all, any and all costs to make it, distribute it, advertise it, have long ago been recouped) and, without any extras, Hollywood should give back a little to the people who have supported them and charge a reasonable price.",1048291200,15,1246,4.386956521739131
515239,5,6302801133,"Nicholas Ray's In a Lonely Place, released by Columbia Pictures in 1950, was long regarded as one of star Humphrey Bogart's minor films, as were most of the Columbia released Santana productions he made both during and after his lengthy and legendary tenure at Warner Bros. Now, the film is considered to contain one of his strongest performances. The Production Company was Bogart's own (Santana was the name of his yacht), which he started in 1948 and sold to Columbia Pictures in 1954. In a Lonely Place is not a whodunit, but it is cleverly disguised as one. The murder and suspense play a backstory to the study of an emotionally sick man involved in a world of strange tensions. The world is Hollywood and although a studio or camera are never seen on the screen, the film captures the loneliness, the lushness, and the edginess of it all. This remains one of the filmmaker's greatest and most deeply resonant features, and one of Bogart's best roles. Bogart plays Dix Steele, a fading screenwriter suffering from creative burnout. He is hired to adapt a best-selling novel, but instead of reading the book himself, he asks the hatcheck girl at his favorite nightclub to read the book and simply tell him the plot. The next morning, the girl is found brutally murdered, and Steele is the prime suspect. There isn't enough evidence to arrest him, but he's so good at thinking like a killer, and is always so up-front about what's on his mind, the police are forced to suspect him. ""I'll be going now,"" he tells them. ""Unless you plan on arresting me for lack of emotion.""
It is the would-be starlet who has starred in a couple of B-pictures, Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame), a new tenant in Dix's apartment complex, who provides him with a solid alibi. Soon, they begin a romance in spite of Gray's lingering concerns that the violent Steele might in fact be the deadly killer, plunging the audience into an intriguing and suspenseful mystery, which quickly becomes a backdrop to the troubled romance between the two wonderfully realized characters.
A lesser director may have established Dix's innocence earlier on and although the spectator naturally assumes Dix is guilt-free (indeed, he does have an air-tight alibi), screenwriters Edmund H. North and Andrew Solt go to great lengths to play with audience expectations, although the film is more about the loneliness and despair in Tinseltown than about the murder mystery surrounding it. We don't see for ourselves that the cynical, alcoholic, and abusive Steele did not kill the hatcheck girl, and of course we have doubts since there is a limited amount of suspects. The only other suspect is Henry Kessler, who was Mildred's boyfriend. Dix, however, claims to have gone to sleep right after directing the girl to walk a block and take a cab home, but he is unable to provide the police with an alibi, and a tightening knot of suspicion begins to form around the writer. It is Mrs. Gray who claims she saw the hatcheck girl leave the apartment complex alone and provides him with one, and the couple fall in love as the suspense mounts.
At first, the new relationship is invigorating for the hard-boiled writer, who plunges into his latest script with a renewed vigor and discipline. But as the police continue to shadow him, Steele's own penchant for violence erupts against friends, strangers, and even Laurel herself, whose feelings are increasingly eclipsed by suspicion that her lover is a murderer, causing their relationship to spiral and her love to turn into mistrust, and fear. Bogart conveys Steele's world-weariness and underlying vulnerability, and manages the delicate task of making both his romantic yearning and sudden, murderous rages equally convincing. It gave him a role he could play with complexity, because the character's pride in his art, his selfishness, drunkenness, and lack of energy, stabbed with lightening strokes of violence, were shared by the real Bogart. Ultimately, that performance and Grahame's sympathetic work elevate In a Lonely Place into what has been called ""an existential love story"" more than a crime drama. The film is a desperate tale of fear and self-loathing in Hollywood cleverly posing as a taut noir thriller. It is the closing lines of the film version, which Dix had written into his
screenplay, that lingered in my mind longer than anything else. ""I was born when she kissed me, I died when she left me, I lived a few weeks while she loved me."" That powerful line sums up Dix's love life, and the film, extremely well",1045526400,27,4535,4.890909090909091

At certain points this movie even outdoes Sunset Boulevard interms of pacing and dialogue. I always find myself sencond guessing on the sanity of Bogarts character. The flick offers up some Staples of Film Noir Grahame is brilliant and so is Lovejoy as his faithfuly committed best friend.  The story is built around Bogart's character obssesive nature towards his work and his underlying need for balance but in the world of noir the underlying tension of shady thoughts and desires always creep into the dark side of town. Grahame offers up so much unease and uncontrolled sexuality its never easy to root for her in this flick.

OK, so, as I was watching this movie, in the back of my mind I was thinking about the review I was going to write. Basically how, despite being a beautifully made movie with terrific roles for Bogart and Graham, it's almost unwatchable today because of the incredibly messed up gender expectations it reinforces -- the faithful, endlessly giving woman who stands by her man even though he is deeply troubled, violent, self-destructive, and puts both of their lives in danger. See, I was fully expecting that in the end they would live happily ever after together.

And then it surprised me. It went all-in on the darkness in Bogart's character, and became that unusual specimen for a Hollywood movie -- a true, old-school TRAGEDY, the kind where the protagonist is defeated by the flaws in his character and the ironies of fate.
