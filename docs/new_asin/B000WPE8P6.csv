2988916,4,B000WPE8P6,"Loved this one so decided to pick it up on DVD and I must have watched it 3 times already. Mr Attell is one funny man, love his stand-up",1320537600,,136,3.7241379310344827
2988917,5,B000WPE8P6,"Hilarious and envelope pushing.  His reading of the audience is impeccable.  His material is as edgy as Sam Kinison's comedy bits. (joke) I look forward to more of his works in the future-- he doesn't need to go on the road any more, he merits a late night talk show after Conan O'Brian because that's when the winos wake up after falling asleep in front of their TV sets. (unjoke) He's worth listening to again and again.  I loved his (three words/phrases linked together for the punchline) the most in his monologue (What's the word to describe that punchline concept?).",1299974400,,572,4.7
2988918,2,B000WPE8P6,"Disappointed wtih this selection. Compared to his CD ""skanks for the memories"", Dave Attel just does not seem prepared for this presentation. We were waiting for great material but although we had a few laughs the CD just ended without a great overall impression. Material seemed not well prepared. Not what we are used to hearing from this comedian.",1276473600,,350,4.9491525423728815
2988919,5,B000WPE8P6,"if you're a fan of stand-up comedy, you already know about dave attell, & you cannot go without this dvd.  you'll find yourself laughing from the very beginning, & quoting him after it's over.  what a performer!",1262649600,,211,4.675675675675675
2988920,5,B000WPE8P6,Dave Attell is hilarious as usual! The product was shipped quickly and in perfect condition.,1220745600,,92,5.2
2988921,5,B000WPE8P6,"Dave Attell is one of the best comedians around and this set is very funny. I've been a fan of Dave's since his Insomniac show and his first stand-up on Comedy Central. This is adult humor and some may be put off by Dave's brand of humor......I think he's hilarious! Grab some beer and some friends and get ready to laugh your A$$ off! The DVD looks and sounds great and it has some very funny, but short extra material. I would have loved to have the Comedy Central stand-up on here as a bonus, but two different companies so, I guess not.",1213920000,,540,4.252427184466019
2988922,4,B000WPE8P6,"If you are a fan of ""cringe humor"" then this is the dvd for you.  Attell leaves no subject untouched and is brilliantly funny in this insightful show.  I watched it with my then current now previous former girlfriend and it was a bit much for her, but well, what do I care especially now that she is my ex.",1201392000,,306,4.083333333333333
2988923,5,B000WPE8P6,"If you don't know who Dave Attell is or only know him from his Comedy Central show, then you are missing out.  This is one of the best stand-up comedy acts in the history of the medium, at the very top of his game.

The DVD show is a consistently great performance and the only people I would NOT recommend it to are kids and prudes.  This is raunchy, at times Dave goes out of his way to offend, but it's that raw honesty that makes the comedy work so well.  For the rest of you....prepare to laugh, a lot.",1200182400,,507,4.04
2988924,5,B000WPE8P6,"Dave Attell is very funny!!!  I laughed the whole time I watched ""Captain Miserable.""  Some of his humour is a bit raw, so if you are offended by ""dirty jokes"", this won't be for you.  It's not the type of DVD you will watch with the family, but if you want some adult humour, Dave is your man.",1198972800,,294,4.0344827586206895
2988925,5,B000WPE8P6,"If you're already a fan of Dave Attell, I don't have to tell you how funny he is. He's a master technician of stand-up comedy and this is a must buy for any Dave Attell fan.

After seeing his half-hour special on Comedy Central, I was hooked. However, there weren't many live performances caught on tape. The performances that were available were so censored and rushed a lot of the jokes lost their impact.

Then came his CD release, ""Skanks for the Memories..."" which is probably the best Dave Attell set, period.

He also has a DVD available on his website called ""Hey, You're Mouth's Not Pregnant!"" which is a live club performance in the South. It's a good club performance with mostly new material and some cool DVD extras. The production is obviously self-produced, but it's still a solid and funny set.

I've seen Dave three times in the past two years. This latest release, ""Captain Miserable,"" is comprised of about 85% new material. It's just amazing to watch this man work. He bounces from topic to topic; from drugs to anal sex to pedophilia. The jokes are constructed so perfectly and his delivery is unequalled.

There's a reason why other stand-up comics will end their sets early just to catch Dave do a midnight set at Caroline's. In short, he's the comedian's comedian. He was born to do stand-up comedy and this special really highlights exactly how honed his craft has become.",1198108800,13,1397,4.709016393442623

8224776,5,B000WPE8P6,"Dave Atell is perhaps not a comic genius - his own laughter seems sometimes a bit nervous (REALLY nervous), and he occasionally seems uncomfortable (REALLY uncomfortable) - but he is devastatingly funny when on, and he's on most of the time.  Best when making the audience a bit uncomfortable (self-deprecating masturbation humor, homoerotic humor, anything about children), he can make you laugh at things you have to shake your head at later.  The Jager ads are a perpetual favorite.  I like being lectured to, and he is just the guy to do it.  Dave can do the stand up thing; Insomniac was genius, and here's the man behind it.  Okay, so maybe he is a comic genius.",1339718400,,668,4.6752136752136755
