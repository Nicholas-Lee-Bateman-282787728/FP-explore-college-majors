Really, you could lump it in with all those other games that came out during the live-action video game boom. There's not much to the game itself. You pick what place to go to, go there, and then watch a video clip. I think a lot of people would probably find it boring. The acting is NOT BAD...but nothing amazing. Anyway, I loved playing this game when I was a kid, and that's the only reason I bought it, to be nostalgic. So, if you're in that same boat, I say go for it.",1140307200,,623,4.073170731707317
2738354,1,B000MQ4WY2,"I have seen basically almost every adaptation of Dracula there is out there- The closest to Stoker's novel being the 1977 miniseries ""Count Dracula"". My favorite being Coppola's Dracula though- that film is a classic. Gary Oldman gave the performance of a lifetime. Despite Keanu Reeves' awful attempt at doing a Brit accent (""I know wheah the barstard sleeps! I brote him theh... to CAWFAX ABBEHHHHHH!""), it was a fun time. When I heard Masterpiece Theatre did an adaptation I got excited- those guys can do no wrong. Well, I was wrong.

First off, this Marc Warren dude is NOT a believable Dracula. He looks like a John Mayer clone. When he first showed up, I expected him to take out an acoustic guitar and sing ""Gravity, stay the hell away from me, Gravity wants to bring me dooowwwn..."". The overly-curly hair covered his face half time and he looked nothing like what I'd imagine Dracula as. And his performance was so wooden I got splinters watching him.

The plot? Almost NOTHING like Stoker's vision. And the syphilis subplot was like SOOOOOOOOOOO SUBTLE! ""Yeah Syphilis was so common in the Victorian Era! It's a surprise Stoker didn't use a syphilis subplot in his book so let's throw one in!"". Add the satanic cult and the character of Van Helsing being defecated on IMMENSELY, and also WHERE IS RENFIELD!!!!!! They omitted him completely!!! Without Renfield, the character doesn't make sense at all!!!!!! Ugh I'm so mad.

Honestly just stay away from this. It's so removed from Stoker it makes the 1992 version look like a 100% accurate version.",1280102400,2,1558,4.8277153558052435
2738355,4,B000MQ4WY2,"this is a fresh take on the well-travelled tale of count dracula. lovely sets and costumes, good acting...but the editing was badly done and the story could have been tweaked a little more to complete the punch at the end. still, i enjoyed it.",1262563200,,243,4.545454545454546
2738356,3,B000MQ4WY2,"I love the novel, and have watched just about every screen adaptation there is to watch. My favorites of the screen Draculas - Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, and Frank Langella. It's difficult to find a truly faithful adaptation of ""Dracula"" in the movies, and over the years the story has undergone all sorts of transformations. This latest treatment by the BBC takes a very different approach to the classic vampire tale. Purists will revile it, but I found it watchable. The story here explores the themes of moral corruption, and repressed sexuality as represented in Victorian England. An aristocrat, Lord Holmwood (Dan Stevens who appeared as Edward Ferrars in the 2008 BBC adaptation of Sense and Sensibility) finds himself in torment over the fact that he has inherited syphilis from his parents. He is also engaged to the attractive Lucy Westenra (Sophia Myles) who is clueless about her fiance's condition. When Holmwood finds a secret occult society that is willing to help him cure his blood disease(at a price of course), he dispatches solicitor Jonathan Harker (Rafe Spall) to Transylvania to settle some legalities with a certain Count Dracula. Jonathan also happens to be the fiance of Mina Murray (Stephanie Leonidas), Lucy's best friend.

Well, Dracula (a horribly miscast Marc Warren) eventually makes his way to England, and makes the acquaintance of both Mina and Lucy, much to Holmwood's displeasure and eventual horror. Things start to deteriorate at a rapid pace from here onwards, and it's left to Holmwood, together with Van Helsing and Dr. John Seward (Tom Burke, who is the real hero here) to put an end to Dracula.

The problems with this adaptation are many - the liberties taken with the novel being one. The Dracula in this adaptation is able to walk in daylight, Van Helsing is reduced to a less than dignified raving old man, and the various central characters in the original source are all playing rather different, or diminished roles. The occult society is portrayed as being the group responsible for introducing Dracula to Holmwood, but not much explanation is given as to how this society came to make the acquaintance of Dracula. The relationship between Renfield and Dracula in the original material was much more credibly drawn than this tenuous connection.

Secondly, I felt that the role of Dracula as played by Marc Warren to be horribly miscast. He is the worst Dracula I've ever seen on screen - he's nothing but a predator and bloodsucker here, pure and simple. There is not much depth to his character, and part of that could lie with the length of this production, a mere 90 minutes. Not much time to fully explore the richness of this Gothic horror story. Both the female leads were rather disappointing, though Sophia Myles' Lucy did a good job as the sexually deprived wife, whilst Mina was reduced to playing a melancholic and grieving lover which got stale after a while. The other male leads were also rather ho-hum, and the most disappointing of all was the role of Abraham Van Helsing. David Suchet is a talented actor and he was reduced to the role of an ineffectual old man here, very sad indeed (especially when one considers how the late horror great Peter Cushing played this role - with such dignity and composure).

On the whole, this adaptation of ""Dracula"" merits a watch if only to draw comparisons with the other adaptations out there, but I would have to say that it was quite an underwhelming and dissatisfying experience.",1257465600,4,3494,4.906937394247039
2738357,1,B000MQ4WY2,"This was just plain awful!  Mina is a very strong female character in the novel, not the wimp portrayed in this production.  There is a perfectly good plot in Bram Stoker's book.  No need to rewrite the story, especially in such a bad way.  Shame on you, Masterpiece Theatre!  I was already mad at you for the fiasco which was the latest production of Jane Eyre.",1257206400,2,362,4.424242424242424
2738358,5,B000MQ4WY2,"This is an excellent interpretation of the Dracula myth. It's dark, decadent and unusual in that some of the characters are active, knowing participants in the conjuring of the nightmare of the Vampire. It also shatters the perceived perfection of Victorian England as it exposes its dark, ""charnel pit like"" underbelly; euro-centrism, self righteousness, religious hypocrisy, sexual repression, sexism, racism, etc. Like the vampire Barlow, in Stephen King's excellent book, Salem's Lot, Dracula is invited to London by a cable of nefarious characters (using unholy rites) hoping for personal benefit; they know not what they've done until it's too late. Dracula, learning of London and it's people, is drawn to this rich new feeding ground like a diseased infested flea. If you're interested in a fresh unique adult take on the Vampire myth, this is well worth renting (I own it). My biggest complaint is that the film is not long enough. With more time and prudent care the screenwriter(s)/Director could have easily incorporated the other characters (from Bram Stoker's classic) into the story.",1253404800,3,1098,5.316091954022989
2738359,3,B000MQ4WY2,This is not the usual Dracula movie from the early 50's. Just a little story type that has added a new perspective to the movie.,1249344000,,128,4.16
2738360,4,B000MQ4WY2,I really enjoyed the Masterpiece Theatre's version of Dracula. Sophia Myles as Lucy was quite different from other versions I've seen.  Sophia is an exceptional actress and played the role extremely well. As I like vampire stories this one was really quite well done.,1236470400,,267,5.068181818181818
2738361,2,B000MQ4WY2,"I agree with most of the reviewer criticism about this film.  I was also disappointed.  As far as Dracula adaptations go, it's bad.  As far as films go, it's bad.  And it's Masterpiece Theatre, for God's sake, with great costumes and backdrops and all that.  As far as BBC versions go, the 1977 Louis Jourdan BBC mini-series that was released on DVD in 2007 is far superior.  Jourdan memorably, as in the novel, crawls head-down the castle wall, and has a memorable French accent (which works, somehow).

In addition, that adaptation follows the novel quite well.  I have nothing against creative re-visions of novels, but this version is just off the mark and actually laughable at points.  The syphilis storyline makes sense due to the disease's prevalence during the Victorian era, but it is presented in such a manner that it just doesn't work.

And characters that should be included are not.  As another reviewer mentioned, how can you have Dracula without Renfield?  Also, so many important themes in the novel such as immigration, the New Woman--even the core good versus evil theme--are so far weakened or are non-existent that it's painfully obvious that they are missing.  The male characters that are present are oddly miscast.  Marc Warren as a goth boy Dracula is not awful, though; he may be one of the aspects of the film that had the most potential.

Even if this didn't purport to be an adaptation of Bram Stoker's novel, it is just plain difficult to watch as a film.  My husband is not a fan of Dracula (probably just to irritate me), but he does like a good film.  He couldn't sit through it, even in the sprit of Halloween when it re-aired on BBC America.  I'd prefer they show the Jourdan version every Halloween.  Dracula-wise, I'd take George Hamilton's 1979 _Love at First Bite_ any day over this.  It's a parody, but it's meant to be one, and it's enjoyable and watchable.",1229644800,,1899,4.714285714285714
2738362,4,B000MQ4WY2,"After all the negative reviews here and elsewhere I avoided this until recently when I found it on the shelf at the local library. What a pleasant surprise. If you are a Dracula purist this version is probably not for you, but if you enjoy all the variations we have had throughout cinema history, this is certainly one of the more unique. I for one thought this Dracula (the character / the actor) is one of the ""hotter"" ones. He is very much a modern day Goth type, and yes a lot like Guppy in Bleak House, but also like Jack White...it's in the hair. I liked how just about every male character was a total CREEP and Lucy was annoying (but not in the usual way). The Mina character was the one limp fish in the pot, maybe it was the actress, I dunno? Another selling point for me was the Black Magic / Occult element, which was hinted at in some of the Hammer films (as early as Brides of Dracula with its talk of ""the cult of the undead"" - here it isn't just mentioned in dialogue, it is shown in rather explicit detail). Again, if you're a purist, you probably won't go for this, but if you are adventuresome and enjoy new perspectives on old classics, give this a shot, you might be pleasantly surprised as well.",1228348800,7,1218,4.2770562770562774
2738363,4,B000MQ4WY2,I am happy with this movie.  It was actually pretty good.  I got it quickly and in great condition.,1213747200,,99,4.157894736842105
2738364,3,B000MQ4WY2,"Ran across this Masterpiece Theater production of Dracula which aired on PBS earlier this year.  Seemed to have been panned by critics, but as it (to my surprise) happened to have Sophia Myles as Lucy, who's my favorite part of CBS's Moonlight series about a vampire and his reporter girlfriend.
The plot is a distinct variation on Stoker's original, with Dracula summoned to London by Holmwood, who has been told he can cure Holmwood's inherited syphilis before he infects his new bride Lucy.  Actually not nearly as serious a variation of the story as the Deane/Balderston play that was the basis of the 1931 and 1979 movies, although not as close as the 1992 version.
I was pleasantly surprised by how good the production was.  Sets and settingss are uniformly outstanding, and far closer to historical accuracy that Coppola's version (which was a nice change).  Myles was very good as Lucy, and Dan Stevens and Tom Burke do outstanding jobs as Holmwood and Seward.
By far the best thing about the production to me, however, was Marc Warren as the ""old"" Dracula.  He was the best I've ever seen, with aged, diseased skin, straggly white hair, filthy fingernails, and an ancient, moth-eaten robe.  He looked and sounded like someone a few days either side of being dead, which is exactly how I thought a vampire should be played, including Dracula at the beginning of the book - far better than Kabuki Dracula in Coppola's version (who was, admittedly a hairstyle and a dressing gown away from being what I had in mind).  I had no idea who he was until he became the ""young"" Dracula, and I realized he'd been the focus of an entire episode of Band of Brothers.  I am not a fan of young Draculas in general, but what was different about this one is that his attraction to women was pretty clearly some sort of hypnotic interest, not a romantic one.  He exerted some sort of power over Lucy, then Mina, but it wasn't romantic - even his seduction of Lucy was clearly when she was not conscious.
A quick note how well the sexual frustration angle between Holmwood and Lucy - who doesn't know why her new husband won't consummate their marriage - was handled.  It could have been (enjoyably) expanded, but wasn't at all inadequate for purposes of the story, and was an interesting take on the issue, as well s bringing in through the back door all sorts of associations with Bram Stoker's life and writings.
Warren as a vampire in full fang was somewhat annoying (as they all are) but as a young Dracula, I think he was probably the best I've seen.  It's just hard to really say, since I really don't seen the book's Dracula as a young man.  As I've said before, I probably see someone with about the age and presence of a current Tom Selleck (not the Magnum one, the Las Vegas one).  Myles and Stephanie Leonidas I'd hire as Lucy and Mina any day.  Myles just seduces the camera whenever she feels like it, and Leonidas portrayed someone of markedly different social standing to Lucy, which is accurate to the book.  And neither was asked to go out of character to be some sort of seductress, or consumed by sexual hunger around Dracula.  Mina in particular was desperately in love with her Jonathan, and what Dracula gets out of her is markedly different.  Same with Lucy - her reaction to Dracula is never romantic - it is simple reaction to his power over her.  Again, to me that's a better way of telling the story.  Footnote to the seductress - of course Lucy does act this way just before being staked, and Myles' acting and the direction hits precisely the right tone - she's a vamp, but let's not overdo it.  (Her vamping on Moonlight last night under the influence of some bizarre pharmaceuticals was an order of magnitude greater, incidentally).
That having been said, the movie for me really started to fall apart as soon as they staked Lucy.  Unlike every other movie I've seen, the staking consisted of her lying compliantly on the ground - arms out of the way conveniently - while Holmwood pushes (not hammers - just pushes) a stake into her belly (not her heart).  The idea that she lies down and pulls him on top of her was an original one, but the idea she'd just lie there and let him stake her made no sense.  At least distract her or restrain her or wait till she's asleep as in the book - make it look at least remotely realistic (I guess we're supposed to think she doesn't think he'll actually do it.  Or, and I just thought of this, she's just a two day old vampire - maybe she has no idea what he was trying to do, or that it'd actually harm her, or even that he would want to harm her.  That sort of makes sense, I guess).
After that, the movie just sort of dragged around until Dracula was the stakee.  But, all in all, not a bad production, and a worthy addition to the Dracula ouevre.  Comes in at #2 for me, and not by a whole lot.",1206835200,,4860,4.474518686296716
2738365,4,B000MQ4WY2,"I have read the book and seen all the movies from the silent version to the Frank Langella version.  I am also a retied stage actor and opera singer.  Without boring you with the technical detail, I lined this version.  It was different, a little resque, with some good mood setting photography.  Was it faithful to the book?  To some degree, it was, but that it ""poetic license.""  This is the best version made since the new century began.  What that says, I will let the readers decide.",1200355200,,488,4.4772727272727275
2738366,3,B000MQ4WY2,"I was awfully excited when I discovered that Masterpiece Theater had made a version of Bram Stoker's classic novel. Always a favorite of mine, I eagerly awaited watching.

Alas, I was sorely disappointed. Lucy looked fabulous. She was gorgeous, her hair was lovely and she was exactly as I had always pictured her. Mina, on the other hand was...rather plain. In contrast, Mina was unexciting, plain and boring looking. If I had been Count Dracula, I would have fallen madly in love with Lucy, based on looks alone. Mina is supposed to be the love of Dracula's life, and she was so dull and drab!

Lucy's fiance was never a big part of the novel. He proposed, Lucy accepts him, he fights Dracula, the end. In this version, Arthur is supposed to have contracted syphilis. We see his tragically deformed father die in a horrible scene in the beginning of the film. Arthur discovers that he too, has contracted the disease. This means he must keep it a secret from his fiance. This whole ordeal made me think much less of him. He is selfish enough to marry the woman he loves, knowing he would give her this disease?

This version has Arthur as the one responsible for brining Dracula to London. He is involved with a black cult that has told him Dracula can cure his syphilis. (Far fetched, in my opinion) Arthur marries Lucy, with the hope that Dracula will cure his syphilis and he can be a true husband to Lucy. Jonathan Harker, Mina's fiance, is sent away to Transylvania (by Arthur) to have Dracula sign documents involving the purchase of property around London. He is swiftly killed by Dracula, who then becomes young. (who should have become young and gorgeous, but alas, disappointment there as well)

Dracula. Ah...the whole reason I've always loved this story. When Jonathan arrives in Transylvania, he is greeted by the oh-so-creepy decrepit Count Dracula. I thought this Dracula looked too much like the character in Bram Stoker's Dracula, played by Gary Oldman. He kills Jonathan (yes, that is really the end for our hero) and becomes young. Another reviewed likened Dracula to Bleak House's Guppy. I am sadly forced to agree. Dracula is pasty, bland and boring looking. No wonder he falls for boring old Mina! In the novel, Dracula is supposed to be handsome, charming and seductive, charms our Dracula/Guppy lack.

What really irritated me about this version is that Dracula falls for Mina instantly. There is no reason for it. Just suddenly he is whispering and moaning her name and clutching a lock of her hair. There wasn't a back story at all to explain his sudden attraction to her. Also, Dracula's aversion to the cross. We see religion as a big part of this film. There are crosses everywhere, and yet, Dracula's fear and loathing of God, religion or the cross isn't explained what so ever! We have to just assume that he is the devil, therefor, he hates the cross.

I liked the costumes and the sets, it was gorgeous to watch. The girls look lovely and are accurate to the period. The Westerna mansion is breathtaking, as is its mistress, Ms. Lucy Westerna. Other than that, Dracula was vapid, and he looked bored or drugged. In most of his scenes, he looked as though he was on the verge of falling asleep! (Except the ONE sex scene between him and Lucy, which I thought was the best part of the movie) I doubt I would watch this film again.",1195776000,,3363,4.662731871838111
2738367,1,B000MQ4WY2,"What the hell was the BBC thinking when they made this?  The BBC produced a fantastic version of Dracula back in 1977 -- Count Dracula starring Louis Jourdan.  Don't waste your money on this, instead get the 1977 BBC version instead.  You'll be glad you did.",1194393600,13,258,4.565217391304348
2738368,1,B000MQ4WY2,"Ludicrous - Dracula looks like a Goth rock star and walks around like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  Supposedly a new twist on the story and they really shouldn't have bothered.  It if had been shown in theaters, probably would have been the surprise comedy hit of the year.

Complete waste of money.",1191715200,3,299,4.60377358490566
2738369,3,B000MQ4WY2,"Okay, so yeah, this Dracula ventures off into its own vampire ideas and doesn't stay to Bram Stoker's story for large plot ideas and chunks of the story line, but honestly it isn't that bad. The basic outline of the plot is the same familiar one we all know, but there's a sort of subplot where Arthur Holmwood is the reason for Dracula's coming to England. He is under the impression that Dracula can cure his syphilis so that he can consumate his marriage with Lucy. So Arthur makes plans with some Dracula-worshipping cult to have Johnathan Harker travel to Trannsylvania to arrange for Dracula's moving to London.
There are several characters missing from the story and odd character backstories. Van Helsing is a bit of a crazy historian living in a creepy basement. Again, the whole situation with Arthur is odd, and Mr. Harker's venture to Trannsylvania doesn't quite turn out the same. One thing that bothered me in this story is Dracula himself. He's not a poorly acted character, but he looks funny. As an old man, the make-up is quite good and he looks creepy and convincing, but when he becomes young, he ends up looking like some emo-goth kid from a band. His attempts at being charming fall a bit flat, but his general creepiness hold just fine.
Another large change is the ending. In the book, Dracula is hunted to Trannsylvania, but here he never leaves London and results in a not so climactic demise....or does he? Anywho, I know that people say the movie is total crap, but I'd say give it a shot, especially if you can find it at a cheaper price. Overall it is a noble production, not a high budget, but manages to get the story told if you can tolerate the sometimes odd story change and emo-Dracula. Definately worth at least a viewing for the Dracula fan.

In terms of tech specs, Dracula is presented in a non-anamorphic widescreen with a Dolby Digital soundtrack. The audio track (which I have my receiver set to ProLogic IIz) is acceptable if a bit lackluster. The picture quality, even when upscaled, leaves much to be desired. Dark scenes seem to be a bit washed out and details never really pop. I can't determine if this was shot on video or if the production is just low budget. Either way, sets and costuming as well as makeup are all rather impressive. I still say worth a look, just don't expect  a revolutionary presentation.",1191110400,3,2360,4.616666666666666
2738370,3,B000MQ4WY2,"If you tend to watch the movie to save the time spent reading the book, then don't watch this movie as a substitute. Movie adaptations of this novel are difficult with the number of characters and location.  Most of these movie versions get around the difficulty by combining characters or getting rid of them altogether.  Other movies simply rewrite the story.  This version does a little of both.  Given that this was for Masterpiece Theatre, I was a little disappointed.

Renfield, Quincy Morris, the vampire sisters, and the gypsies are all gone.  Jonathan Harker barely misses this fate.  Disease and occult rites make an entry into the story.  The end result gives the viewer (especially readers of the novel) the feeling that this was what the screenplay writer would have done if he had written the book.

Does this make it bad?  It does if you are a Dracula enthusiast.  If you just like a good vampire story, then this is interesting, as long as you don't think of this as Bram Stoker's Dracula.",1189641600,25,1005,4.718390804597701

There's no effort to redeem Dracula in the subtext as just another fella blighted by love. It lacks the elegance of some older versions, but adds some grit. The plot is a bit slow-going; at no point was I engrossed, but it is nonetheless an interesting interpretation of a classic tale.",1186012800,,467,4.695121951219512
2738373,1,B000MQ4WY2,"Apparently seductive vampires, malignant superpowers and evil vs. good aren't sufficiently chilling enough anymore. We need STDs, satanic cults and a loopy hermit.

Because those are only a few of the mutilations made to Bram Stoker's classic ""Dracula,"" which the BBC has raped in just about every way a plot can be. Wretched direction, appalling acting, and a plot with barely a shred of Stoker's original story -- we're left with a third-rate vampire flick that thinks it's first-rate.

Arthur Holmwood (Dan Stevens) is apalled when he finds that his father is dying of syphilis -- and he was infected at birth. To save his life and sanity -- and marry the beautiful Lucy (Sophia Myles) -- he involves himself in a strange cult that promises to cure him. Meanwhile, young solicitor Jonathan Harker (Rafe Spall) is sent to Transylvania to sell a house to the decrepit Count Dracula... only to meet a gruesome fate when he sees Dracula's true nature.

Arthur and Lucy have married, but the wedding is not consummated, so Lucy spends most of her time with her pal Mina (Stephanie Leonidas), who is worrying about her fiancee Jonathan. Then one night a ship crashes on the rocks nearby, and it seems that Arthur and the cult have unleashed Count Dracula on England's shores. The only way to stop him -- and save Mina -- is to trust in a strange man who already knows too much of vampires...

It's pretty difficult to find the shreds of Stoker's original story in this adaptation -- apparently the BBC writers were under the impression that they could do better than the greatest vampire story ever written. So they tack in syphilis, a murder mystery, a satanic cult, a mysterious disappearance, and Van Helsing being a crazy old man locked in a basement.

It might not have been as wretched as it is, had it not been for the woefully bad direction. Lots of seizure-inducing quick cuts and repetitive close-ups of fangs, and plot holes you could drive a truck through, such as Dracula's sporadic immunity to sunlight. Moreover, the first three-fourths of the movie are miserably slow and dull, only to tumble rapidly to an unsatisfying, inconclusive ending.

And the whole ""erotic vampire-blood-sex"" undertone, which has been around since Victorian times, is handled with hilarious consequences. Whose idea was it to have Dracula orgasm every time he drinks blood?

Ultimately any ""Dracula"" movie is only as good as its Dracula. Marc Warren is no fiery, sweeping, intense Boyar prince with a deep thirst for women -- he looks like a Neanderthal goth frat boy with too much makeup, and he's apparently too stupid to get to England without someone sending him a ticket. He's no Bela Lugosi or Christopher Lee -- he looks (and acts) more like Jack White with a severe head injury.

The rest of the cast is about as impressive. The talented Suchet does as well as he can with a loopy, fearful Van Helsing, and Myles does a solid job as Dracula's first girl. But the other actors are mediocre at best -- Leonidas is particularly awful when she's feigning hysterics, and Stevens is an embarrassment as a bad parody of Arthur.

The latest adaptation of ""Dracula"" falls below the worst of Hammer Horror and lame TV movies -- a bastardized disaster of syphilitic writing, miserable direction and a Dracula who's as intimidating as a wet sponge.",1184198400,8,3332,4.811188811188811
2738374,3,B000MQ4WY2,"I was surprised, being that it was presented by PBS' Masterpiece Theatre this would be a faithful adaptation of the famous novel. Instead it was a radical revision of Dracula, and the main characters, with the glarring omission of Renfield. However, there were scenes involving the introduction of the main characters I thought at first might be the introduction of the Renfield character. Eg: When Dracula appears on the shores of the wrecked Vesta ship in daylight, I thought he was Renfield waiting for his Master. But he wasn't. He looked like a Renfield, pale and gaunt. Another scene: when they discover the old man locked in Dracula's dungeon, I thought that would be Renfield. No. It was Van Helsing! And he was portrayed as a shaman of demon-ology.

2738376,1,B000MQ4WY2,"The first book that I ever read cover to cover was (Abraham) Bram Stokers Dracula. I rode the bus down down all by myself to the Erie Bookstore, to purchase a hardcover Modern Library edition with a dust jacket.

I watched the BBC production of Bram Stokers novel Dracula, in which Count Dracula is played by Louis Jourdan. So I was ready for another two-and-a-half-hour blockbuster. One can never have too many versions of the Dracula story..........Boy was I disappointed! However, it was an interesting take on the story. In the beginning there is a section that suffers from bad editing which makes no sense. Arthur Holmwood in this version pays Count Dracula's way to England mysterious cult offers him salvation from a terrible secret by accepting a transfusion of his blood. I don't think that he he is aware that Dracula is an animated corpse who suffers himself from rare disease, porphyria, or vampirism. When Dracula goes to put the bite on Singleton who is the high priest of the ""Brotherhood of the Undead,"" he pulls out a revolver, and shots himself in the head rather than obtaining eternal life. His aim should have been worse, and shot screenwriter Stewart Harcourt screenplay though the head. Donald Sumpter, who plays the part of Singleton, co-starred with David Suchet in the Hercule Poirot movie The ABC Murders, about a serial killer in 1930's London. Bram Stoker's original notes for his novel include a character named Alfred Singleton.

I love Jess Franco's Count Dracula, but the major problem with that film is Herbert Lom as Van Helsing. He plays the role as the character who is ineffectual, and it is a wonder that they get Count Dracula in the end. They should have got Peter Cushing for ""Professor Abraham Van Helsing."" David Suchet (who is know for portraying detective Hercule Poirot) in the role as Van Helsing looks and sounds like Peter Ustinov as The Old Man in the movie Logans Run. I was waiting for him to talk about his precious cats.

Some people don't like Jack Palance in the 1973 television version of Dracula. I love Dan Curtis productions of Dracula, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Jack Palance was very believable in the roles. It is to bad that Jack Palance did not accept other roles as Dracula. Dan Curtis? Kolchak: The Night Stalker is the best series that has ever been on television.

Francis Coppola's 1992 version of Dracula was a major disappointment. Where did the idea come from to hold together Dracula's Castle with huge steel I-beams? I have a lot of problems for the chooses that they made in making this film. It is made in a Gone with the Wind style. The BBC version of Dracula his castle is clearly a model. The models in Mel Brooks' 1995 version of Dracula, Dead and loving it are much more realistic.

I could get into the bizarre cult that worships Dracula. I though was a good idea, but they made them look too much like Devil worshipers. I don't understand what is wrong with gypsies? Is it because they hate gypsies in England? Dracula is not evil, it is a love story, the Passions of Count Dracula. What Dracula does to survive. The problem is that it spreads evil, but he did not create this evil. Dracula was not the first vampire in history, but he was the most successful at it. Lilith is sometimes called the mother of all vampires is part of Jewish demonology and mythology, which has its basis in early Babylonian demonology. In the original story, Dracula has existed for 500 years, and in the BBC version they claim that this creature is 900 years old. They cannot even get his age correct. Are they making him as old or older than Dr. Who? The thing about Count Dracula, he can posses any woman that he wants, but in the process of making her like him, her soul is lost. He can have their love and their heart, but never their souls. Lets face it, Marc Warren would not even be a good choose to play Dr. Who. Marc Warren?s Dracula is not even suffocated enough to have three brides hanging out with him in the castle.

The move held on to the notion of the anxiety and fear of sex during Victorian era. This version cut out the characters of Renfield, and Quincey Morris. Jack Seward is played too young, and I kept waiting for them to add in a homosexual character, which the Victorians really had a problem with. Since it may be implied that there is more to just the discussion of sexual matters between Lucy and Mina, and they had shared a common sexual life together.

Dracula always seem to me like a comment on Anti-Semitism. Don't impose your Anti-Semitic Religion upon us. Dracula may be the Jew with his long nose who will not step into the light. He will never walk in the light because he embraces the darkness. Dracula and his vampires are hunted down to extinction because they walk in the darkness. He turns away from Christian symbols, and can be held at bay by them. A vampire corrupts the young girls with their unholy union. Keep it Kosher! I get if someone would hold up a slab of bacon, we would both run away in terror. He casts no reflection in a mirror because he has no immortal soul even though he is eternally undead. Dracula being undead is like being eternally stuck between heaven and hell. When Dracula dies, there is never any mention that his soul is released. He is in limbo, until he can come back stronger. Ebenezer Scrooge (more than likely a gentleman of Hebrew extraction) said it best, ""Humbug! Let me practice Xmas in my own way.......(not at all)"" Evil is in the heart of man, and not in super-natural creatures. This means that if goodness is not found in the heart of man, then you won?t find it in the hearts of super-natural creatures. It god is dead, then magic is also dead.

The only way that this version can be saved, Turn it into schlock. Film an hour and a half of adult X-rated scenes, and combine the film with this new additional footage. Then this made for television movie version might be worth watching. The only good thing about this Masterpiece version of Dracula is that there a lot more dreadful vampire flicks out there. I would rather watch (over and over again) Dracula: Dead and loving it. David J. Skal, a scholar of the original Dracula film hates Mel Brooks' 1995 version of Dracula. Dead and loving it is based upon Bela Lugos's classic Universal flick of 1931, Dracula, and takes jabs at Francis Ford Coppola's grandiose 1992 interpretation of Bram Stoker's classic novel. Leslie Nielsen plays Dracula in a camp fashion. It is a role Bela Lugosi would have played. He always wanted to make a color remake of the original Dracula, and he loved doing camp as well.

This movie adaptation of Dracula that features the detail from the novel, that the Dracula character grows younger as he drinks more blood. The other two versions were Jess Franco's Count Dracula, and Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula.

Murphy's Law now seems to say, that the BBC cannot out do their 1977 class of Dracula. We know that the actor and director Clint Eastwood can make war movies and westerns. Someone needs to make a bet with him, that he can not make his own version of Dracula. Mr. Eastwood would make a version which would win Academy Awards. This BBC version would not even get a nomination. Someone bet Aldous Huxley that he could not write a science fiction book. Jules Verne and H. G. Wells had their own vision of how people in the future would be effected by machines. So he wrote Brave New World, and was forever after he know as a science fiction writer because of only one book.

I watched it on Masterpiece Theater, and will purchase the DVD. I collect vampire movies: the good, the bad, and the ugly. Thumbs drown to the new BBC version of Dracula! It is bad. There is no one to wish to win or survive, since Jonathan Harker the traditional hero of the original story is killed off in the beginning of the movie. I told a bunch of people about this movie, luckily nobody I told tuned in to watch this dog of a picture. The movie begins, and ends with a bad hair day for the Count.

2738377,3,B000MQ4WY2,"While this production was well-meaning & took a different approach to the Dracula story it ultimately fails on many levels:

1. Far too short in length..........Like the screenwriter was in a hurry to get lunch.

2. Ripping off the 1969 Hammer film Taste The Blood of Dracula with the ""secret cult"".

3. Ripping off the 1979 Frank Langella version with Dracula as a seducer of wives & ""living"" at the end.

4. Marc Warren just doesn't make a good Dracula.

2738379,1,B000MQ4WY2,"Oh dear, where to begin?  First and foremost this waste of celluloid bears little resemblance to Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"".  Its not even close.  Given a 90 minute running time there is no way it could.  But that isn't the real problem here.  The real blame for this travesty lies with the writing and the casting of this production.  The script is a complete and utter mess.  Rather than focus on Dracula and the menace he poses for the characters (and by extension Victorian morality) the writers have chosen to fabricate a silly plotline involving Arthur Holmwood trying to purify his syphilitic bloodline (huh??).  Apparently he can only do this by joining up with some secret cult and agreeing to buy Dracula a ticket to England.  Poor Arthur can't consumate his marriage to Lucy Westenra until he can cleanse himself of the syphilis he's inherited/contracted from his parents.  Of course how he's managed to carry syphilis into adulthood without manifesting any symptoms before hand is nothing short of a miracle.  Besides why does Dracula even need Holmwood to buy his passage to England when he has all these devout followers in London to begin with?  Can't they fork over a few pounds for his travel expenses?  Van Helsing (played by Poirot's David Suchet) rather than being the fearless vampire hunter is now some dishevlled madman being held prisoner by the Dracula cult in London. He's no longer the strong paternal figure we usually assoiciate with him and he only has about 10 minutes screen time altogether; he provides a bit of vampire destruction lore to the heroes but thats about it.  Quite frankly he no longer serves any real purpose in this version of the story and I can't see why the writers felt it necessary to keep him on.

With any really good version of ""Dracula"" you need a really good charismatic actor for the lead role.  Preferably someone with a hint of sensuality and capable of being menacing at the same time.  Unfortunately Marc Warren is not that actor.  Nothing personal in regards to Mr. Warren.  He's a fine actor (check out ""Band of Brothers"") but he isn't right for Dracula and having him look like a reject from the band ""The Cure"" doesen't help.  Dracula, former warlord, King of the Vampires is now reduced to being a wimpy Goth club kid.  No thanks, I'll pass.

The production values are OK and the cinematography, locations etc. are all fine but this is can't overcome the inept script and poor casting choices.  The pacing is also a probelm and even though this thing clocks in at 90 minutes it felt like 2 1/2 hours to me.  Anyway this is a poor production of ""Dracula"" all around and should be avoided like the plague.  There are any number of other versions of the famed blood sucker out there but there is one in particular I would easily recommend over this turkey.  Ironically it too is from the BBC and was produced back in the 1970's.  Its called ""Count Dracula"" and starred Louis Jourdan in the title role and Frank Finlay as Van Helsing.  Not only is that version far more faithful to Stoker's original concepts and story but it has much more gothic flavor and far more chills than the newest production could ever even begin to hope for.  It is now available on DVD and can be easily obtained from Amazon (its cheaper too).  So, don't waste your time on this bit of rubbish.  It will literally suck the very life out of you.",1173657600,50,3389,4.645378151260505
2738380,1,B000MQ4WY2,"I echo the remarks of the other 1 star reviewers. This is surely the worst Dracula adaptation ever made.  Boring, ridiculous and poorly written.  The screenwriter obviously never read the novel.  What was Masterpiece Theater thinking?!",1172707200,2,235,5.472222222222222
2738381,1,B000MQ4WY2,"When I saw an advertisement for BBC's Masterpiece Theatre's version of Dracula, I thought it was the great 1977 broadcast with Louis Jourdan as Dracula. Unfortunately, it wasn't.

Instead, it was the 2006 Dracula. Were there that many requests for it to be remade yet again? This inaccurate, boring, incompetent, silly presentation had some nerve to flicker across my TV. The bug stains on my wall are scarier.

This movie gets everything wrong. First of all, Arthur Holmwood is NOT the center of this story! There is NO blood cult that worships Dracula. Van Helsing is NOT reduced to a doddering old fool in a basement. There is NO mention of Holmwood's dad dying of syphilis.

This movie makes a ridiculous attempt to throw away the blood/sex symbolism and emphasize the sex, with its mortal fears and weaknesses.
That's not what Dracula is about. Bring on the bats, crosses, shadows, wolves, mirrors, and the brides. What's a Dracula movie without those sumptuous brides?! Oh, and I almost forgot - Renfield is needed too.

The pacing in this movie was that of a quick slide projector. There was no character exposition whatsoever, only quick cuts here and there, back and forth. Maybe if they merged this movie with To Hell, a Jack the Ripper flick, it would've been interesting.

In short, the 2006 Dracula isn't even good enough to be amateurish. I'm going to recommend buying BBC's 1977 Dracula production, with Louis Jourdan in the title role, Judi Bowker as Mina, and Frank Finlay as Van Helsing. Why did BBC redo a teleplay they perfected in '77? Money!

Believe in vampires all you want. Forget that Dracula '06 exists.",1172016000,10,1630,4.845323741007194
2738382,2,B000MQ4WY2,"Although it was an interesting adaption I was very disappointed with Masterpiece Theater. I had hoped that this version would be some what different from Francis Ford Coppla's Dracula (which I enjoyed) and more closer to the book. However, the many changes to the story lost the originality of Bram Stoker's vision. I was also disappointed that the movie was presented in a mere 90 mintues, which limited the character interacted with one another. It would have probably been better had it been 2 or more hours. The only thing I did like about the film was Marc Warren as Dracula and the two female actress playing Lucy and Mina. But again I was disappointed that their performances and talents were robbed of what could have been a great adaption. Dracula and Mina's characters shared  moments together, but in the end there was a urging for more passion and emotion between them that the movie didn't present. My only hope is that these actors could once again reprise their roles, but be allowed to offer a satisfied literary Dracula.",1171670400,5,1037,4.793296089385475
2738386,2,B000MQ4WY2,"I am a big fan of vampire mythology. I consider Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" classic. When I heard that Masterpiece Theatre had done their own interpretation of the immortal classic, I was excited to see this new version. What a major let down this film was. Now I wasn't expecting a word for word interpretation. I knew that there would be some changes made to the story, I just didn't know how bad those changes would be. Masterpiece Theatre totally massacred Bram Stoker's novel. Screenwriter Stewart Harcourt should have stuck to the novel instead of using metaphors and analogies. Dumb idea. I didn't like how the character Jonathan Harker was reduced to a minor character while Dr. John Seward and Lord Arthur Holmwood each received a bigger role in the story. I won't even get into the sub-plot of Arthur joing some bizarre cult that worships Dracula. That was lame. That idea would have been perfect for any B movie that stars Darian Cane but not for a Masterpiece Theatre production. I also did not enjoy the actor who played Dracula, Marc Warren. He was not remotely attractive nor a good actor. His performance was laughable at best. His performance was overwrought to say the very least. He would have been the ideal Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde or Frankenstein but the last person I would consider to play Dracula. Marc lacked the grace and elegance of the character Dracula. As hammy as Bela Lugosi was back in his day, he was a much better Dracula than Marc Warren. The women were the only good actors in this lifeless adaptation. The costumes and scenery were nice to look at but overall not a very good interpretation of one of my favorite novels. Yes Bram Stoker's novel is not Shakespeare and leaves lots of room for interpretation but what BBC and Masterpiece Theatre did was run the novel through a paper shredder. This film was a total insult to the story. At least this was a lot better than that dreadful vampire flick ""Bloodrayne"" and that is saying a mouthful.",1171324800,4,1977,4.683908045977011
2738387,3,B000MQ4WY2,"This 2006 BBC production of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"" is mediocre -or perhaps I should say wildly uneven. Where it fails, it fails spectacularly. Like many before him, screenwriter Stewart Harcourt reinterprets and reorganizes the timeless story of Count Dracula, an ancient Transylvanian vampire come to England to conquest the modern world -modern being 1897, when the British Empire placed a quarter of the globe under the reign of Queen Victoria. Harcourt's adaptation seems inspired by two ideas: The Victorian fear of sex and an effort to make Bram Stoker's most bland and underwritten character, Lord Arthur Holmwood, into a catalyst, villain, martyr, and center of the story.

Vivacious young Lucy Westenra (Sophia Miles) has agreed to marry the wealthy and handsome Lord Arthur Holmwood (Dan Stevens), to the slight dismay of their mutual friend Dr. John Seward (Tom Burke), who was a rival for Lucy's affections. When Arthur's father dies, having long suffered from syphilis, the family physician informs Arthur that he was exposed to syphilis himself at birth. Fearing the same fate as his father and knowing that he cannot risk spreading the disease to Lucy, Arthur turns to a mysterious man named Singleton, who claims that his master, a Count Dracula (Marc Warren) in Transylvania, possesses the secret to eternal life. If Arthur would bring the Count to England, his syphilis will be cured. Solicitor Jonathan Harker (Rafe Spall) is dispatched to Transylvania to handle the conveyances. But when he doesn't return or write, Jonathan's fiancee Mina Murray (Stephanie Leornidas), a dear friend of Lucy's, is beside herself with worry.

So Arthur is the cause of all the trouble in this version. It's not a bad idea. Arthur and Lucy are the film's strength. Arthur's desperation and anguish at his inability to have a physical relationship with his wife are palpable. Sophia Miles is a vital and appealing Lucy. The couple's sexual frustration drives them both to wit's end and drives the story. This ""Dracula"" exploits the very real Victorian fear of syphilis that injected itself into many a marriage. But the other characters are underwritten, and the story is cluttered with a lot of pointless embellishment. The Van Helsing character is superfluous. Singleton's ""Brotherhood of the Undead"" is needlessly complicated. The staking scenes -most unfortunately Lucy's- fall completely flat. Marc Warren's Dracula is, oddly, a sensualist. His variably seductive and repulsive persona makes no sense and packs no punch. His ability to be two places at once undercuts the suspense.

This movie is only 90 minutes long. Simplifying the story would have gone a long way in improving it. As it is, this ""Dracula"" is not very good, but I think that Dracula aficionados will find this twist on the Holmwood character interesting. I'm reminded of another television adaptation of ""Dracula"": The 1973 version that starred, i.e. miscast,  Jack Palance as the fanged Count wasn't very good either. But it introduced the lovelorn Dracula theme that found its way into Dracula lore and into Francis Coppola's lavish 1992 theatrical production. I kind of like the idea of Arthur inviting Dracula to England to save himself from madness and death. After all, vampires need to be invited. The endurance of Bram Stoker's novel lies in its ability to inspire each generation to reconceive the story, so we shall see how far this interpretation goes.",1171324800,20,3440,5.181654676258993
2738388,5,B000MQ4WY2,"The Gothic, nightmarish, vampire context of Bram Stoker's Dracula has long captivated and enthralled readers for 100+ years.

Many readers - from literary critics to folktale scholars to historians et al - have long asserted that Stoker's motif of vampirism is a metaphor illustrating the freedom and morality (and lack-thereof) of sexual exploration and sexual lasciviousness, and the grueling consequences that accompany both.

Syphilis has been identified by readers as one of the main consequences that Stoker was alluding to; syphilis was a disease that permeated Stoker's Victorian era environment, and undoubtedly influenced his thematic crafting of Dracula.

With the exception of the ending, the 2006 BBC production of Dracula masterfully strips away the supernatural metaphors of Stoker's novel and replaces them with reality: sexually oppressed people grappling with their sexual desires, their awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, and their moral and religious obligation to uphold unspoken social norms (remaining virtuous until married); also depicted is the psychological and physical effects of syphilis that literally ravage the body and mind.

One fantastic and unexplained dynamic of the plot line is the nature of Dracula's (and Lucy's) vampiric visions and tendencies: has syphilis made the Count insane enough to think he is a vampire, and thus he acts the part? We never find out, and, to complicate this intriguing seed of thought, the film's denouement concludes with a typical stake-in-the-heart resolution, which can either indicate that the Count was a vampire, or that Van Helsing, Seward, Holmwood, and Mina were unaware of the psychiatric abnormalities that syphilis caused and thus erroneously attributed vampirism to the Count's idiosyncratic actions.

The 2006 BBC version is filmed like a stage play, which enables the viewer to feel the emotional elements of the entire production: Holmwood's urgent desire to cleanse his syphilis-plagued blood, Mina's devastating loss of Harker, Lucy's burning desire to be physical with her husband, Seward's angry pursuit to revenge Lucy's demise, and Van Helsing's determination to kill Dracula.

The production is brilliantly cast ""against the type:"" virginal, sweet-faced Sophia Myles is cast as Lucy, a flirtatious, lusty young lady; exotic, sensual-looking Stephanie Leonidas is cast as the pure, plain-looking Mina; noble, dignified, handsome actor Tom Burke is cast as the lonely and rejected Dr. Seward; the awkward, boyish-looking Dan Stevens is cast as Lord Holmwood.

Brilliantly and perfectly cast, yet tragically and criminally underused, are Marc Warren as Dracula, and David Suchet as Van Helsing.

Marc Warren, whose cold-eyed, cruel-lipped and cruel-jawed physicality matches Stoker's description of Dracula, had virtually no dialogue and little physical movement in this production. Warren is naturally sexy and sensual, has a unique style of vocal intonation, has deadly penetrating eyes, and cruel facial expressions. He has given powerful, electrical, overlooked performances in Oliver Twist, The Principles Of Lust, Band Of Brothers, The Bombmaker, Green Street Hooligans, and Boston Kickout.

David Suchet, a master at portraying detective Hercule Poirot (replete with Poirot's famous and unforgettable nuanced Belgium accent), is only given a few scenes with which to create and embellish one of the greatest minor literary characters of all time - the intriguing, erudite, charming, enigmatically spellbinding, Dr. Van Helsing.

The technical production of this 2006 Dracula is the syphilitic plague that has marred this film. Choppy fast-paced scene-to-scene editing, unnecessary jerky camera movements, undistinguished/uninspiring camera angles, lack of impressionable art direction, lack of Victorian era local scenery and antiquity, lack of Transylvanian local scenery, lack of a garish-nightmarish colour scheme, and unaesthetic distant shots of toyish -looking castles failed to invoke an ominous, macabre, phantasmagoric ambiance that is a categorical essential to all Dracula productions.

The soundtrack score by Dominik Scherrer is one of the most dazzling and scintillating scores, resplendently dirgelike and requiemesque, that has ever graced a BBC production.

Hopefully the plot line seeds of this fascinating yet technically flawed version will be contemplated by viewers, and resurrected and refashioned and polished in future Dracula productions.",1171238400,7,4469,5.837423312883436
2738389,1,B000MQ4WY2,"I am wondering why adaptations of Bram Stoker's Dracula must stray so far from the book.  The version by Francis Ford Coppola contained a non-existent (and unnecessary) love story and this new BBC version involves a secret blood cult that sends for the Count supposedly to cure a syphilis-infected Arthur Holmwood (who is engaged to be married to Lucy but keeps his health issue a secret).  This is the wildest departure from Stoker's story that I have yet encountered and it seriously undermines the story.  Also, the scenes dealing with Holmwood's father in the throes of death from syphilis are particularly disgusting and gratuitous.

The program is also poorly edited.  The scene will be set in Transylvania with Jonathan Harker in conversation with Dracula and abruptly switches to London for a few seconds to show relate the murder of the partner in Harker's law firm, the shifting back to Dracula's Castle. Marc Warren does turn in a good performance as Dracula, and he is very creepy when Harker first encounters him.  However, in the novel Dracula takes pains to make Harker comfortable with dinner and a pleasant room.  In this production the sets are cold and forbidding not the kind that would put Harker at his ease.  Also gone are the scenes of Harker traveling when he meets the people of Transylvania and they react with horror over his going to see Dracula.  Sadly missing, as well, is the coach ride that Harker is taken on to Castle Dracula.  The simple scene of a coach letting him off in front of a non-descript building was confusing and not dramatic. My list of questions goes on and on, far too long to discuss here.

The BBC also short changed its audience by making a 90 minute Dracula. Surely, a two hour version should have been the minimum.  They should have made a version as close the book as Brideshead Revisited - now, that would be greatly welcomed.  One wonders what the point was in making a Dracula so short and such an obviously flawed script.",1171238400,7,1982,4.726744186046512

I am sorry to say this is actually the worst version I've ever seen. Even worse than the Dan Curtis version with Jack Palance in the title role.
  Clocking in at a scant hour and twenty minutes,so many classic characters and scenes are missing, while dumb subplots completely change the story. This whole film feels so rushed and you practically get whip lash from the jump from scene to scene, leading up to the ubrupt ending.
  The story begins: Arthur Holmwood has syphillis, so what else do you do, but contact a vague malevolant cult called the Brotherhood of the Undead, and arrange to have a ""magician"" come and cure you? When Johnathan Harker arrives to meet Dracula, we see an elderly burned out hippie. When Dracula is old or young he spends every scene hunched over staring blankly and whispering silly dialogue George Lucas would be proud of, like everyone else in the film. Dracula's wives do not appear in this one, and Jonathan Harker does not live through his visit.
  After arriving in London, Dracula decides he doesn't want to help Holmwood and ends up killing the brotherhood. Holmwood finds VanHelsing in a dungeon in the basement. He has been imprisoned there for ""knowing to much"". Why they just didn't kill him we will never know. So they just go to Dracula's house and stick a stake in his back and he vaporizes. Thats it.
  The acting was so wooden, the dialogue so silly, the story so boring, and not scary that my family and I spent more time chuckling, or groaning with boredom than being interested or scared.

It's an amazing recreation from the awesome Sega Mega-CD game of the same name. It can be kinda slow depending on your DVD player, but on a computer it runs at breakneck speeds even beyond the original Mega-CD version.

It look truly beautiful, technology has come a long way since a decade and it's an absolute delight to see the redrawn art work and full screen video. I'm amazed beyond belief they preserved the original footage of the game from so long ago. No more small grainy windowed video clips this is really good quality. It's like a dream come true as I loved the story of the original Mega-CD version, but thought it was a pity about the limitations of video quality back in those days but here we have a perfect version of the game even including the ability to save like the original.

I only wished all the movie/anime games from the Mega-CD could get this kind of treatment as I would love to play Night Trap again, and at this high level of quality. Dracula Unleashed was one of the best movie titles on the Mega-CD so it's only fitting to see the brilliant story come to life once more even if others don't follow in it's footsteps.

5 Stars and very highly recommended!",1170806400,3,1458,4.369003690036901

8170561,4,B000MQ4WY2,I hav seen or own practically every version of Dracula ever made. this gave a different spin to the story. The only fault I would give this version is that the title of the film should have indicated in some way the version change.,1368748800,2,231,4.2727272727272725
