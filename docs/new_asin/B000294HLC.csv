2069108,1,B000294HLC,"This is an absolutely awful DVD, and I'm not talking about the film itself. I can't say anything about the film, because the technical quality is so bad I couldn't get 15 minutes into it. The video has no midtones and no sharpness, and the audio is muddy in the extreme. If I had to guess, I'd say it was made by placing a video camera in front of a television showing the film, with a microphone placed in front of the TV speaker. The result: clumsy editing (for TV time, no doubt), bleeped words (likely again for TV) and unlistenable sound. Women's voices are lost, as are any male voice that isn't loud. In short, this gives every indication of being a bootleg -- and not a good one at that.",1190332800,9,695,4.2727272727272725

8024076,3,B000294HLC,"The low-budget opening credits with awful oom-pah music nearly had me hit the STOP button, but I like the cast so I stuck with it.

It was worth watching for a few reasons that only barely outweigh the reasons not to watch it. The worthwhile reasons include a gorgeous Senta Berger, beautiful Swiss scenery (thought the film's color was washed out) and the pleasure of recalling how people dressed in 1976 to go to an airport, and how cars operated -- the latter without car alarms or seat belts -- even on the Autobahn.

So, a bit of a fun time warp.

On the down side, the plot is ridiculous. Fortunately, the composer's opening salvo of oom-pah band is followed by much better music in the actual film, though a little dated. I caught a lick of ""Spooky"" (a hit by the Classics IV back in the day) playing during an establishing shot. And Senta turned on a radio that was playing a Beachboys' song, ""Sloop John B,"" covered by a German group. What a hoot!",1372896000,,956,4.420454545454546
8024077,1,B000294HLC,"I can't get enough of David Janssen, so I ordered this DVD despite the bad reviews. Well, they were right. It's pretty bad. The picture is fuzzy, the sound is mushy, and the story is kind of hard to follow, but that's probably because of the bad picture and sound...and poor Mr. Janssen looks depressed and bored.  He's kind of like a watered down version of his Harry O character, without the punch and personality.  But, I have to say, the movie made me want to fly to Switzerland immediately because of all the gorgeous scenery. That was the best part. Plus, I did enjoy seeing DJ zipping around in that hot little red sports car.",1369440000,,633,4.448275862068965
8024078,1,B000294HLC,"Don't order this dvd. The quality of the copy is very poor and the format is a 4x3 with bars on the sides and on the top and bottom of the screen.
It looks like they just filmed a TV screen and made this awful dvd. It is disgraceful that companies can sell dvds like this one and not pay a big fine or
something like that.

I really wanted to watch this film, especially after having finished watching the whole ""The Fugitive"", but the copy is too bad and it is not worth trying to watch this copy, despiste
the lack of good copies.

I read reviews about other copies of this film and they were all bad but I thought that, maybe, this one  would be a good copy  and there was no review about it
to warn me that it is not.

Now there is  a review to warn other customers about the very poor quality of this dvd. I like in the UK and it will be  a hassle to return the dvd as I bought it from a
seller different from Amazon. But I will return it and  ask for full refund.",1369008000,,969,3.883248730964467
8024079,2,B000294HLC,"I'll start by admitting that I didn't watch the whole movie, it's that bad. I thought it would be better given the cast, but it's obviously a low budget film. The dialog is clichd and unsophisticated, really poor writing. The movie itself had bad music, bad sound, and a lot of color distortion. I know it's an old movie but it seemed to be in exceptionally poor condition.",1368576000,2,373,4.5
8024080,3,B000294HLC,"The Swiss Conspiracy, 1976 film

Switzerland's biggest industry is banking due to its secret numbered accounts which provide a safe sanctuary. [Only as long as their government can withstand foreign powers.] This can be used by those who want to hide their monies, legal or illegal, from government investigators.

The movie begins at a restaurant. An assassin shoots a lone customer. Then the credits roll with a view of snow-covered mountains. We see a letter on the floor of a bank; it is taken to a manager. Next a suitcase arrives at an airport. This customer has nothing to declare for the contents of this suitcase. He is followed. That found letter asks for ten million francs to prevent their secret accounts from being revealed. A new customer drives up. Parking is tight. Mr. Hayes arrives with a complaint. This crime must be investigated without publicity. Hayes has an objection, he will make a telephone call. We see an answering machine that records phone calls (the office model). Unexpected complications?

David Christopher was hired by the Hurtil Bank. He is attacked in an underground parking garage but escapes. The police arrive. The man got away, but is chased again. There are shots in the street. Hayes bites the dust. Christopher arrives for his meeting. Was this crime an inside job? Did Christopher rent a car? What was left in the trunk? Christopher gets a message from Jack Foley. He meets another customer. When he returns to the bank he finds another letter. The bank will pay, the customers will take a small charge. There is a car chase on a mountain road. They kiss and make up. Later Christopher sees two bank employees meeting. More scenes of Zurich streets. David meets Rita. Rita meets Franz Benninger. David is followed, the police follow the followers. Another shooting in broad daylight? They don't escape. Rita explains her actions: for love and money.

We see dancers at a nightclub. The police have a problem about major crimes (murder and blackmail). What was done with the blackmail money? Uncut diamonds are easy to conceal, and untraceable. David gets a limousine ride to the country. They get another message. Herr McGowan is unwell, and leaves. A steam locomotive pushes up the hill on a cogged track to a ski lift platform. David knows a likely suspect. Is there a surprise in learning the killer? A double-cross? Will the diamonds be saved? ""They can be ours!"" Does David have an affinity for bodies? ""Don't forget the diamonds.""

The conspiracy plot is revealed at the end as a surprise. The presence of Hayes was a complication or sideshow. Like other stories, there is a conflict when it comes to splitting the loot. No honor among thieves? This story is about average, the scenery offers an advantage. The slow pacing seems typical of many European films of that era. [Does this story echo ""The Maltese Falcon""?]",1300838400,3,2870,4.872950819672131
8024081,3,B000294HLC,I liked the movie.  It was great.  I just wish it would have been copied from a better print of the movie.  Video quality was not that great.  It had a tendencey to skip scenes on my machine.,1200528000,7,191,3.9473684210526314
