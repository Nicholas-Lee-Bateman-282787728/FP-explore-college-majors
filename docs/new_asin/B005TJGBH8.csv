2) I bought the movie for Another Stakeout; I LOVE those two movies!
3) I've not yet WATCHED Another Stakeout on this dvd, but the disc is in excellent condition.
4) The company through which I ordered this video did an excellent job. THANK YOU!

As for the 2nd movie? I KNOW I will like THAT! These guys crack me up. If you are looking for a good comedy, these two (Stakeout; Another Stakeout) are a great pick. You don't have to watch them in order to enjoy them individually, but the laughs about double if you you do! :) ENJOY......................",1428537600,2,659,4.357723577235772
8486263,1,B005TJGBH8,"Too late to return the dvd because we didn't get around to watching the dvd until a week over a month from purchase.  And it's not worth exchanging it and having to pay a restocking fee because it arrived as a sealed dvd. We did not get to see the last half of the movie, V.I. Warshawski, because the film stopped midway & jumped back to the beginning of the dvd [where one can choose the titles to click on - 'play' or 'chapters']. We clicked on play, fast-forwarded to the see if we can pass that spot it stuck on. No luck. It jumped back to the beginning, so we clicked on 'chapters' and fast-forwarded past the chapter[13] where the movie had stopped. It played for 1 second & jumped back to the beginning again. The only reason why I bought this dvd was because I love the movie V.I. Warshawski and my daughter wanted to watch it with me because it is one of the few action/adventure films with a female lead taking charge of the situation.  'Another Stakeout' was just a bonus; that movie did work ok, but I could have done w/o it.  I guess I may not be buying dvds' from consumerwarehouse again. I might add that, I didn't actually check the dvd for scratches before playing it as I assumed -it's a new dvd, why should there be any scratches?  So why were there scratches?",1387411200,,1279,4.2946058091286305
