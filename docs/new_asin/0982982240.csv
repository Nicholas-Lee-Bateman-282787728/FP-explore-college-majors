If you want to join a flamenco fiesta with some hand clapping, or if you want to improve your accentuations when dancing or guitar playing, this video will help your ear training.  I like the variety of rhythms taught, as well as the fact that you can start first with one pair of hands, then add one more pair of hands, foot and/or guitar. I also like that it is designed for beginners and advanced levels.  Very good investment for those interested or passionate about flamenco.",1235606400,5,591,4.566037735849057

7795150,5,0982982240,"I always think the soul of Flamenco is its magical rhythm. There are too few similar products on market. Anyone who's interested enough to learn Flamenco dancing, guitar or singing, anything to do with Flamenco, should learn palmas first. It's a great fun to accompany guitar or dancing with palmas during a Flamenco party.

The little booklet amazingly presented so much information on Flamenco rhythm and styles. The explanations are clear and straightforward. The instructions are easy to follow. The DVD demonstrates the various palma patterns for different types of Flamenco styles, including basic, first voice and second voice, and remate (finish). I only tried two basic and one finish patterns and already impressed many people!

The only downside is that I can't find performance demonstration on the DVD. You've learned the patterns but how to use it to accompany dancing or guitar? Of course we can always find other materials ourselves but for a learning DVD it would be handy to include a simple performance demonstration matching each styles taught in the DVD.

Overall, I'm very impressed by it and highly recommend it to anyone who has a passion for Flamenco.",1282608000,4,1176,5.114583333333333

'Can you play the piano?'
'I don't know, I've never tried.'

The point of this hoary old joke is, of course, obvious to all.  What may not be obvious (especially to tourists and other casual observers) is that it applies equally to the clapping that is such an integral part of the flamenco environment and atmosphere.

Although the basics can be, and are, absorbed through osmosis by those growing up in Andalusia, to become proficient requires discipline and practice.  Furthermore, even the basics may escape poor benighted souls (such us ourselves) who live outside Andalusia and must therefore flounder along as best they can.  But now, help is merely the touch of a button away!

As with castanets, so with palmeros: for maximum effectiveness, you need a minimum of two, one laying down the basic rhythm and one overlaying it with variations.  ""Aprende y practica las palmas"" is a DVD, with enclosed booklet, that is designed to teach you to take either of these rles.

PRESENTATION

The DVD is one of those commendable double-sided ones with a PAL version on one side and NTSC on the other. The booklet is enclosed in the standard DVD case.

There are 80 pages total.  However, the text is presented in Spanish, English, French, German and Japanese, so this only represents about 14 pages of each.  The remaining 10 pages consists of charts of the various flamenco rhythms.

Translation of flamenco material into other languages is a minefield (as the corpse-littered terrain of the early literature amply demonstrates), requiring as it does not only complete bilinguality but intimate familiarity with both flamenco and standard musical terminology in both languages.  The translation here is good apart from a couple of trivial errors (such as the consistent use of 'comprise' for 'compose' and the occasional translation of '3 por 4' as '3 by 4' instead of '3/4', etc.).

The explanations are in the booklet, but not on the DVD, which contains only the examples.  Thus you definitely need to read the former before playing the latter (unless you already know what you're doing, in which case you don't need this anyway).

BOOKLET

The explanations of rhythm are accurate, but compressing so much information into so short a space is likely to be confusing to anyone not already familiar with Flamenco.  In addition, while stating (correctly) that it's common to measure the bulera based on the same pattern as the sole, but beginning on the 12th beat, it also considers the possibility of referring to the initial beat as beat 1.  In my experience this is to set one foot on the slippery slope to insanity; far better to use the first twelve digits as the names of the beats, so that there is never any ambiguity.

These things, as well as the general advisability of learning to walk before you try running, lead me to recommend you to acquire at least a basic familiarity with flamenco rhythms before you jump too far into this.

We then pass to the meat of the booklet: tables of clapping patterns, which are given for buleras, tangos, tanguillos, rumba, sevillanas, fandangos de Huelva, sole and cantias.  Multiple possibilities are given for both the base rhythm and the second voice.

DVD
The video shows  the examples with many possible permutations: 'you can listen to the palmas separately, the bases and the second voices, or all together combining the different patterns.  And you can also choose to see the foot tapping or not, hear the guitar or not, while you clap along.'

In addition, a scale at the bottom of the screen with a moving cursor shows what the current beat is.

SUMMARY

This is a very competent production, filling a large hole in the available flamenco literature for non-Spaniards.  Despite its modest size, it contains a great deal of practice material.

If you live alone, or want to practice on your own so as not to disturb your partner (using headphones, perhaps), it's ideal.  And if your partner should happen to be into Flamenco as well, its even better.

Recommended.
