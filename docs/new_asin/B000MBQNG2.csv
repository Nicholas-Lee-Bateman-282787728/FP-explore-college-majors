8167645,5,B000MBQNG2,"This video begins with Patty Duke making comments.  She is also a bipolar person.  The video shares the lives of primarily four different patients who have bipolar.  It shows the interaction between the patient and the doctors who care for them.  One patient, in particular, demonstrates an excellent example of the mania with her rapid speech, talkativeness, and racing thoughts. Another patient shares about his spending spree problems and why he was arrested.  Another patient gives a good example of the depressive side of the illness of bipolar.  This video lasts for one hour and is worth the viewing.",1353369600,,607,5.08080808080808
