8172686,5,B000MV8K3Q,"This is not one of those boring historical videos about Saint Paul.  The narrator takes you through the area where Paul traveled, even recreating some events like falling from the horse or Paul's descent down the building wall.  The narrator is also very reverent when being in a church, so he serves as an excellent role model.  With the fast-paced action and the excellent historical truisms, this is a fantastic video for everyone in the family or for students in a religious class!",1227312000,12,485,4.819277108433735

His deep insights (and humor) ensure that you will learn as you are being entertained. Adults like me love this series because of the real knowledge of the faith and the challenge to live our faith. Our kids like this series because Steve keeps their attention and makes the faith fun.,1193788800,22,427,4.417721518987341
