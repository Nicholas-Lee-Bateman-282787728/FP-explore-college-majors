7126061,3,B00W7AHJQO,"Bryan Millers (Lee Tergesen) is a former CIA agent who is now a mall cop. His ex-wife (Lauren Stamile) is looking to remarry a porn star named Money Maker (Reno Wilson) while his daughter (Laura-Leigh) attempts to lose her virginity.  Meanwhile there are evil Albanians who are lead by Brown Finger (Margaret Cho).

The film is a near ""Airplane"" style spoof of Liam Neeson films, mostly the ""Taken"" series. The humor was on the predictable side, in this smile out loud production. The film copies the Woody Allen ""Screw"" scene from ""Bananas.""

7126062,4,B00W7AHJQO,"I'm a sucker for a good parody movie!  If you've read any of my reviews, you'll know that the dumber something is, the more I like it.  But let's be honest here, if you're deciding whether or not to watch a movie called ""Tooken"" then you probably already know what you're in for?!  This movie, like most all parody films, is so over the top stupid, that you can't help but laugh!

I've enjoyed everything Lee Tergesen's done since first seeing him in Wayne's World way back in '92.  He takes on the role of Bryan Miller, the counter version of Liam Neeson's, Bryan Mills from ""Taken"".  To be perfectly honest here, there's not a whole lot to talk about.  It also touches on Neeson's ""Non-Stop"" movie as well,...perfectly, I might add!

This movie is definitely NOT for everyone.  If you're offended by nudity, crude humor, or if you don't like completely off-the-wall comedy, don't waste your time (or money)!  However, if you like movies that are only filmed to make you laugh at the most juvenile situations,...this movie is for you!

Final Verdict:  Check it out!  I thought it was great!",1432944000,3,1091,4.619791666666667
7126063,2,B00W7AHJQO,"Okay, the supporting cast is funny and there are some amusing jokes here, but lets be honest...its called Tooken. Its exactly what you think it is, and if you're in the mood for that kind of movie, then you may be amused, but as far as a comedy goes, it doesnt really work well. Its a spot on accurate spoof of the Taken series (prior to the 3rd installment), and they even manage to throw in some spoofs from Non-Stop, but its, by far, not a good movie.",1432771200,2,454,4.170454545454546
7126064,3,B00W7AHJQO,Had a couple of laughs. My utmost reverence towards Donnie Wahlberg kinda decreased tho.,1460160000,,88,5.357142857142857

7126066,1,B00W7AHJQO,Cool title but a terrible attempt to spoof the TAKEN movies.  Save your money.,1453507200,,78,4.571428571428571
7126067,3,B00W7AHJQO,It did have its funny moments.  Donnie Wahlberg is only in movie for a few seconds in a TV scene.  lead actor is excellent with material he has to work with,1443312000,,156,4.0

7126069,5,B00W7AHJQO,This movie is absolutely one of the best parodies I have seen. This whole cast and the guy who play Brian Millers is hilarious. I couldn't stop laughing at certain scenes. The fight scene towards the end was I'm sorry the most hilarious thing I have ever seen in a movie.,1440979200,2,271,4.333333333333333
7126070,3,B00W7AHJQO,"Like all spoofs, it was moderately funny.  This spoof differs from most because it was so well made.  It seems to me that the production values were pretty high and the movie comes off very well.  I cannot tell just how close it was to the Taken franchise because I have only seen 1 of them.  That being said, I did enjoy Tooken.",1437868800,,329,4.174603174603175

7126073,4,B00W7AHJQO,"Easily one of the funniest lines I have heard in a long time.

So for a spoof of Taken, I think it's safe to say Tooken is about as good as it's gonna get.
And that ain't all that bad as this film was predictable, desperate and crude....but what spoofs aren't any of those things?
They're all the same, throw enough crap at a wall and eventually something will stick...in other words tell enough jokes and your bound to get some chuckles at some point.
I thought this was well done, and well spoofed from beginning to end.
The lead although not Liam sized got the attitude and voice just right and the rest of the cast were pretty funny characters in their own right, especially Money Maker and Mom...just hilarious.
If you don't like spoofs then yeah...you're not gonna like this.
But as a spoof lover this hit the spot nicely.",1434499200,3,828,4.447368421052632
8712477,5,B00W7AHJQO,I love this movie! It's a great showcase for all the talent and just a fun vehicle to hang a bunch of jokes together! It could not be more fun to watch everyone's beautiful TV mom Joyce Bulifant in an irreverent comedy! Margaret Cho is hilarious. Lot's of silly fun.,1515542400,,266,4.34

8712480,2,B00W7AHJQO,Silly... I realize this is supposed to be silly. But it's a little much. If you're bored and want something you don't have to pay attention to its ok.,1481500800,,150,4.206896551724138
8712481,1,B00W7AHJQO,"Amazon should have paid me $4.50 to watch two minutes of this awful thing. I must have really been bored and looking for a laugh. THE ONLY LAUGH IS ON ME. Don't make the same mistake, not even for a dime.",1472774400,,204,4.0

8712484,4,B00W7AHJQO,"Fun movie; re-watchable.
Saw it last month on HB-Show-Cine.. whatever.. Premium cable chan",1462924800,,90,6.0
8712485,3,B00W7AHJQO,"Much better than all of the ""movie"" movies. With the exception of Scary Movie. A nice step in the right direction for spoof movies since the ""movie"" movies all but ruined the legacy that movies like the naked gun and airplane set up.

My one critique is that a good spoof movie should have a very serious story line that's handled in an absurd way. Most spoof movies either have no story and they're an excuse for pop culture jokes or the story is there but doesn't matter. This one's story wasn't super serious. It was about a guy trying to reconnect with his family following a divorce. Had someone in the movie actually been ""tooken"" and the plot revolved around getting them back it would have been better I think. Lee Tergeson and Reno Wilson were pretty great though and had the best lines.

If the story had more focus it would definitely be 5 stars (for a spoof movie)",1462147200,,876,4.434782608695652
8712486,2,B00W7AHJQO,"Having seen this flick on youtube the other day i gotta say that flick did have it's up's and downs. This movie tooken is yet another spoof film that has based it's entire theme on the hit movie ""taken"". If you've seen movies like the ""naked gun franchise"", ""national lampoon's: loaded weapon, ""scary movie"" franchise, ""superhero movie"", ""disaster movie"" and ""epic movie"" chances are you've already seen this kinda movie before. This tooken film had it's high and low point's, but mostly low's. It was a little funny at times but in very small doses. The whole time i watched this flick i couldn't shake the fact i've already seen this kinda movie before so it was very difficult to be fully engaged in this film no to even mention that this film lacked creativity and humour. The only thing i truly enjoyed completely was the UNKNOWN rock sensation record ""rock is the answer"" which was the soundtrack to this film. Overall this film is not the worst movie i've seen but it's not the best either.",1461110400,,997,4.638418079096045
