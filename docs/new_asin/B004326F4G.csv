4252633,1,B004326F4G,"Horrible waste of time.  I absolutely loathed this guy by the end and so did everyone else I watched it with.  Self-centered mooch spends a few years selfishly ""improving"" his game and enjoying coaches, trainers, experiences all paid for by anyone associated with the movie.  He bemoans his relationships with his two dads but bolts to Scotland when his wife is due with their son to seek more enlightenment.  Grow up dude.  The preview was very misleading and this guy had no chance of ever making it on the tour.  Wish I had that grueling hour and 45 minutes back.  What a joke.",1298764800,2,580,4.572815533980583
4252634,1,B004326F4G,"This is the most boring, self-center, nonsense movie about a wimpy, self-absorbed, spoiled person.
Where is the golf? Grow-up Fitzgerald!!!! This guy has major personal issues. All is does it talk about his personal problems. This is 100% self promotional. There is very little golf covered in the movie.

4252639,2,B004326F4G,"As a golfer who often thinks about dropping everything and going for it, this documentary left me feeling empty and wondering why I wasted my time watching it. The more you watch you will realize it is clearly about his personal ego and need for attention. The majority of the film is him talking about himself and his ideas, not actually doing anything. He did not drop everything and go for it, rather committed insufficient time and resources. The beginning starts with a grand goal but actual actions and results are never disclosed to the viewer (aside from a couple random insignificant handicapped amateur tournaments he played in).",1363737600,2,639,4.925925925925926

4252641,1,B004326F4G,"This is my first ever Amazon review.  I simply can't not attempt to spare others.

I played golf in D1 golf in college, so all my friends and family think I'm something special when I play with them.  They think that I should have more seriously considered playing professionally.  My handicap was a +4 the summer before my senior year.  Well, that was mostly at my home course, which was your average park district track, in perfect weather, under no pressure...

That D1 golf team I played on? One of the worst 50 in the country.  And I was never better than the 3 man in any tournament.  The best player on my team was significantly better than me in all aspects of the game.  He was the runner up player of the year in our conference, but he couldn't start for any Big 10 or SEC team.  Oh, your average guys at the major schools would get slaughtered by by someone on a decent mini tour... who would get cleaned by the Nationwide Tour....  who don't even have a PGA Tour card.

All this to say, people who have any idea just how wide the chasm is between your average chop and a professional would be disgusted.  Just because you don't need to run a 4.5 40 or have a 46in vertical or bench 350lbs doesn't mean you're any closer to becoming a professional in golf than any other sport.  You're still at 1 in a million if you started as a 5 handicap at age 30!  You'd actually track his finishes at the Golf Channel Amateur Tour as a indication of his progress?  He's in a highly uncompetitive flight of an irrelevant tour, winning a one day tournament at 12 over par.

Please don't watch this.",1362009600,7,1596,4.302013422818792
4252642,3,B004326F4G,"So let me get this straight: He went from a 15 (handicap) to a 10 before they ever started filming.  Then from a 10 to around a 2.  If you google his tournament results, to summarize, he is a really good amateur.  The film, however engaging, is incomplete.  I am sure this is for the reason that he basically failed in his quest.  The yoga chick is rather attractive however.",1361836800,,375,4.3
4252643,1,B004326F4G,"Here's a middle age clown, thinking he can start to play the game at 40, and then enter the pro circuit. This is the biggest insult to pro golfers I've ever seen to basically say, you guys are so poor at this I can beat you with almost NO SKILL.

Two swings into the film I can see this guy has never hit a quality golf shot in his life, because his swing is so poor and so amateurish.

This isn't a film about golf, but rather a totally un-grateful idiot that has TWO great fathers, and thinks this is horrible and an awful burden to carry. Instead of being grateful for that gift, and going forward, he uses's this as an excuse to get sympathy and spent his life manipulating people. I wish I would have had ONE FATHER!!!

Just like he did in this film to get free trips and free equipment and free instruction, this master scam artist goes to OTHER scam artists that charge big money for nothing ever proven effective in golf, and gets them to buy into free stuff because he's making a film.

What this man has NO understanding of, is that massage, yoga and acupuncture and all that stuff only helps an already good golfer, FEEL good enough to play better for a longer time. This guy thinks it actually gives you a better swing, and will make you shoot in the 60s which is what you need to do in the pros.

He's a pitiful high 70s player, with only a thousand guys in every big city in America, that will eat your lunch and take every dime you have gambling on a game, and he has never, ever felt one bit of real pressure in his life with a golf shot. It's that pressure at the pro level that is so intense that it takes already GREAT PLAYERS, and I mean 60's shooters on their home courses, and makes them crumble on Saturday and Sunday at the highest levels of this sport, and that is the HEART of this game.

If he actually KNEW anything about this beautiful game, he'd know many great players including Mr. Bobby Jones himself said, ""There are two kinds of golf in this world. One is what everyone plays on the week ends and has fun with, and the other is tournament golf at the pro level, and one has NOTHING in common with the other.""

This self obsessed drama queen, that demands attention in life from everyone like some child, thinks gimmicks rule the game of golf, instead of pure talent, and being born with genes that are different than the rest of us. A pro golfer can take a set of clubs off the rack at K-Marts and with no sleep and hung-over from the night before, STILL beat every non pro want-to-be gofer out here, but our ""hero"" in this disaster of a film, thinks a good massage will do the trick and fitted clubs will propel him to stardom.

Finally......the golf channel amateur league, is NOTHING at all like real competition going against a crummy 2 or 3 OTHER guys In YOUR FLIGHT!!(He wins with an 84 for gods sake)If I shot an 84 I couldn't except the trophy I'd be so embarrassed. I'd tell people that was my brother and he left the course already!! This was a miserable film, with nothing to do with high level golf, and if every golfer missed this foolish piece of cinema the'd be better off.
YOu want a better game???? DON'T WATCH THIS AWFUL FILM!!""",1361577600,8,3181,4.2724252491694354
4252644,4,B004326F4G,"As an avid golfer (7 handicap), I really enjoyed this film.  All of the negative reviews surprised me.  Maybe a person needs to appreciate golf more to have enjoyed it?  Life is short.... and yes, life is about prioritizing all of the demands of life, but there is nothing wrong with chasing a dream or setting out on an adventure.  I think this was a great story.",1358035200,,364,4.388059701492537
4252645,1,B004326F4G,Just horrendous.  This guy does not have his priorities in line.  It is certainly tough to sit through the whole documentary.,1357171200,,125,4.904761904761905
4252646,2,B004326F4G,"Fitzgerald just seemed really selfish and deluded to me.  I could not root for him.  He talks about his childhood and his two fathers, etc., etc., yet he goes off to go on a golf tour in Europe leaving his pregnant wife and daughter at home.  Robert Redford's comments about Fitzgerald starting his own film festival is very telling... the guy can't deal with rejection.",1355529600,2,370,4.661538461538462
4252647,4,B004326F4G,"I am in the demo. If you are not you probably will not get this movie. If you are you will totally relate. As an over 40 guy who has toyed with trying to get good at a sport again I really in the demo. Thus I greatly enjoyed this. The challenges and the balance that is need between sport, family and work all ring true.

Further as newly golf obsessed I also enjoyed the film. The descriptions of the game were outstanding. I just started golf two years ago and have played over 100 times this year.

If this is you, then enjoy. If not move on. I am a fan.",1354147200,,557,3.9642857142857144
4252648,4,B004326F4G,"I think most reviewers hate this movie because they are golfers and think the whole idea of going pro at the age 40 (and half ass training for it) is not only insane but in some ways disrespectful to the sport itself. If this was a fictional story maybe the reaction would be different and might have got a laugh or two. I think this story was more about his relationships with his father and step father over all. It is obvious he has some issues with these relationships.

There is a TV show called ""Chasing The Dream"" that very similar to the ""The Back Nine"" story. The two characters are Chris Anderson, a successful businessman with a family and Robbie Biershenk, a driving range owner. They are both trying get on the PGA Tour but the main difference between them and Jon Fitzgerald is these guys played in the low 70's.

I noticed that Jon Fitzgerald has not played on the GC AM Tour since 2009. So this makes me think making the movie was more important than his golf career.",1351209600,,983,4.395604395604396
4252649,4,B004326F4G,"I enjoyed watching this movie for a couple of reasons. The beautiful scenery of the golf courses, the complicated story of love between fathers and sons,and the concept of following a dream despite all the obstacles along the way. The story isn't so much about golf as it's about a man discovering the secret to happiness. It's his journey to following his dream that brings him the lessons he needs. Fitzgerald gave us a slice of his life, but hope he offers us more. I feel as if he's a good friend now.",1350432000,,505,4.440860215053763
4252650,2,B004326F4G,"The guy seems like a nice guy. But not only do I agree with the other negative reviews, I'm also calling shenanigans on the whole project. An 84 in his first tourney? With a swing like that I find that highly unlikely. There are great athletes that golf semi-regularly that don't shoot a legit 84. And now he is a 4 handicap apparently, similar to former college players. This movie is unexpectedly hilarious. The cheesy yoga instructor playing the role of mr. Miagi, him claiming he was working 80-100 hours a week, taking care of his family while taking 8 strokes off handicap,  his dad claiming (in defense of his absence) he worked 120 hours a week. His next movie will be called ""bottom of the ninth"" where he is hitting 340 in the Yankee farm system but has to leave his games early to go manually mulch his plot of land in Iowa while dr. Phil provides inspiration and you can sign up for this thing for only $99.99 and have people work directly beneath you and his dad used to play chess with Woodrow Wilson",1349222400,,1014,4.422459893048129
4252651,1,B004326F4G,"This guy needs to get a grip (sorry for the golf pun).  I'm 62 and have a 1.6 handicap and actually have a golf swing unlike this guy.  Embarrassing.  Interesting that one of the golf courses shown as a backdrop in the film is Silver Rock in Palm Springs where they play some of the Bob Hope professional golf tournament.  Its 7,500 yards of wicked challenge that a guy like this in the documentary wouldn't even break 100 on and yet he has the arrogance to think he can play professional golf with the big guys who break par on that sucker.  Yup, this guy moved on to the national amateur championship for the GOLF CHANNEL HOGAN FLIGHT!!! which meant he was a 8 to 11.9 handicap at the time and he played against a bunch of weekend hackers who were just out for a good time.  I just played the Nicklaus Ritz-Carlton in Tucson where they play the Accenture Match Play in the winter and its an impossible 7,800 yards for someone at my level and I could whip this guy cold.  He needs to show a little more respect for just how incredibly good the big guys are on tour and the professional women as well who would make mince meat of a hack like this guy.  I'm a 1.6 handicap and I've always thought that if there was a crippled senior tour where some of the greats were playing out of wheel chairs I might be able to make the bottom rung of that tour.  At least I'm realistic.",1347926400,6,1373,4.209923664122138
4252652,1,B004326F4G,"No talent ass-clown, delusions of grandeur. This guys swing was not only ugly but appeared to have zero improvement throughout the film. I felt awkward every time I watched him swing, even more so every time he opened his mouth. The real golf pros seemed overly judgmental in their opinions which seemed odd to me, they just had to of seen him swing before making those comments, that whole part was kinda unfair to them.

If you plan to watch for a glimmer of what it might be like to go pro, don't bother. This documentary has zero value and I'd hate to think anyone comes away from it thinking that a single bit of it reflects the true life of someone with half a chance. I was very disappointed.",1347235200,,699,4.376923076923077
4252653,4,B004326F4G,An enjoyable documentary that shows the many challenges involved in chasing your dreams while also raising and supporting a family.,1342828800,,131,5.6
4252654,1,B004326F4G,"Look, the guy is really nice. He's got an awesome family. He's working through some lingering father issues he's had since childhood. And he's trying to lower his handicap.

But don't fool yourself into thinking this is actually a documentary about someone pursuing their dream of playing professional golf. This is at best a documentary about a guy trying to get moderately better at golf. And he does go from a 15 handicap to a 4, which is cool. But throughout the course of the entire movie, never does he actually, truly, wholeheartedly try to make a real go at playing professionally. He plays an amateur tour the entire time in, I believe, the second flight (maybe the third), and admittedly only practices 10 hours a week. A week. So like, an hour a day, at most two. And at the end of the movie, he doesn't even play in the friggin' National Championship that he qualifies for! And he's **really** serious about playing golf professionally?

It's just a boring movie about a really nice guy trying to play more golf while working through some father issues, dealing with a hectic job, and trying to raise a family. Skip it.",1342483200,2,1131,4.65
4252655,2,B004326F4G,"Incredibly boring (the film too), Jon Fitzgerald fails to inspire. He generates little interest and, consequently, support in his quest to become a professional golfer. His is a story deliriously absent of adversity, intrigue and triumph. The film ends where it begins; a better than average golfer living a privileged but average life.",1340668800,,336,5.3584905660377355
4252656,2,B004326F4G,"This move is for YOU...If you love movies about 40 year old guys talking advantage of  serious instructors i(im guessing in exchange for free pub) in a half assed attempt to make some amateur golf tour that nbody knows exists.

In his first ever tourney the guy wins...shooting an 84?  Iit  goes downhill from there

Production is pretty solid and earned that second star though.

So, It seems the director has loaded the amazon reviews with shills.  Anybody giving this sucker 5 stars is either a friend or stoned, very stoned.",1334534400,8,528,4.736263736263736
4252657,1,B004326F4G,"This movie/documentary was brutal.  They should show it on a loop in a interrogation room until the guy breaks.....

I couldn't get over this guy's crappy swing and delusions of grandeur.  Dude, please!! After seeing you swing one time, I knew there was no way you would make it.  And to top it all off, your personality was worse than your swing.  What I wouldn't give to have that hour and 45 minutes back in my life.  Stay away!",1323388800,7,431,4.3924050632911396
4252658,5,B004326F4G,"I really enjoyed this special documentary. I found it refreshing, inspiring and thankfully, real. Unlike many documentaries, the film is not preachy, or overwrought with politics. The story of Jon Fitzgerald's journey is so very relatable: Who hasn't considered mid 30's or 40's, what would happen if we allowed ourselves to set aside our ""real jobs"" and instead do what we really loved? It is a brave course, and I admire Jon for letting us in and sharing his experience.  I think The Back Nine illustrates a common dilemma to modern man [and woman]; a quest for who we are, where we come from, and ultimately finding what makes us happy and whole.  Weeks after seeing the movie I was still thinking about Jon and his journey, and of course, golf.  Isn't the style in which we play the game an allegory for how we might like to move through life?",1301961600,3,847,4.596026490066225
4252659,5,B004326F4G,"This movie provided me with far more than a simple insight into the game of golf, or into the personal motivations of one man attempting live out his dream mid-stroke into adulthood.  Instead, it painted the picture of an individual redefining the American paradigm by pushing past the obstacles of age, convention and long-standing family conflicts.

""The Back Nine"" is a well-crafted documentary that uses golf as a backdrop to expose real-life challenges, and includes the lesson that it is never too late to reinvent your reality.",1301356800,,534,5.126436781609195
4252660,4,B004326F4G,"A terrific tale of a man in midlife, grabbing and creating the opportunity to fulfill an ambition to get not only better at golf, but great at this most frustrating game. Along the way, he lets the viewer see into his life and family, and the effect of his ambition on what turns out to be the most important things to him-his relationships to his wife, children and father.

4252662,5,B004326F4G,"I saw this at a festival and was worried that I wouldn't get into it because I know nothing about golf.  But, what a great surprise.  It's about sports, family and life!  It's a delicate balance that the filmmakers handle beautifully, never getting preachy, cynical or sentimental.  This is a genuine look at mid-life when you are forced to balance so much as youth starts to slip by.  It's a fun glimpse into the competitive golf world, too, and all that it takes to make it in that world.  You have to have admiration for Jon; he does his best despite the challenges and ultimately becomes a better man because of it.  Highly recommended to sports and non-sports fans alike!  It's just simply a good film.",1300838400,,707,4.555555555555555

I took my sister to see it when she was in town because she is a big golfer and I thought she'd enjoy it. Turned out, I was captivated the entire time as well! I really know very little about golf and imagined it would be a doc that required more golf-know-how to enjoy. SO not true! This movie is really about persuing a dream and the balancing act that this entails when you are not a super star, have not been ""discovered"", or have other obligations in life like a family and a mortgage! I left the show feeling inspired and hopeful about examining my own life and questioning, ""Is it really too late to persue that dream I left behind me when I was 25?"" I learned a thing or two about golf but the fascination of the movie was really found in the man (Fitzgerald) and not the game.",1300838400,,805,4.166666666666667

Jon's story is refreshing, and depicts a realistic journey many people can relate to as we ""grow up"" and still crave certain accomplishments.  At 40, life can be more meaningful and precious but it's a lot harder to get there with the realities of raising a young family, financial commitments, and dealing with childhood baggage. I loved the movie and I am not a golfer, it delivered so much more than lessons on the golf course.",1300838400,,531,4.648936170212766

4252667,5,B004326F4G,"Wow!  I watched this movie, to help take strokes off of my golf game, but I got so much more!  A great father and son story, with interesting characters, of people we all know.  Jon and his dad seem to have a very real love relationship, having acquired their long-term life's dream of being able to play St. Andrews!  They also proved that even after coming from a broken home, they never forgot how each could have a very strong respect, and great love for each other.  The camera work was surprisingly good, showing many grand shots of Ireland and Scotland.  Jon, the main character, learned how a man, and father, had to make his own family, his main priority, with his ability to provide a good living for them, a very close second.  Amazing methodology in improving one's golf game is satified tremendously, with life's lessons a wonderful added benefit.

From chef to pro basketball player and in this case pro golfer. All too frequently life gets in the way of being Kobe or Tiger. So what if you get that one little window to try? Most of us are too afraid to give it a shot. I give the guy a lot of credit for chasing a dream. I got lost in the dream of it all and really enjoyed it.,1300838400,2,478,3.79

It was inspiring to watch a person aim high and learn about golf as a sport, but also about himself as a person. We all wear many hats in today's modern, fast-paced world.

This movie is beautifully done and well worth your time - especially if you are an avid but amateur golfer in your thirties, forties or even fifties. Many of my friends and I have dreamed about whether we could make the tour if we went all out to do so. And that's what this guy did. And he did not sugarcoat his experience.

He is no better then your average weekend warrior.  The movie is just a documentary on this guy's life...which is pretty boring in all honesty.  It is not a golf movie and more a self aggrandizing idiot trying to make a buck off of suckers for golf movies.  Wish I had the money and time back.,1476057600,,453,4.22093023255814

8414080,1,B004326F4G,"Despite the description when first presented, this is NOT a movie starring JOHN SCHNEIDER (Dukes of Hazzard, Smallville, Haves and Haves Not, Smothered). I was duped the description. John DID make a movie for SPIKE TV, but this is not it, despite the same name. Do not be fooled. I had to return the DVD. Very disappointed in IMDB and AMAZON for providing faulty information for the consumer.",1462752000,,392,4.779411764705882

8414083,2,B004326F4G,Someone pretty good and kind of dedicated.  It was the story of an average guy with family past issues who likes golf and saw it as another way to connect with his biological father.  It may not be that interesting but I would not slam the guy for trying or being unrealistic.  One female reviewer seemed to take perverse pleasure in this.  Small person.,1436486400,,354,4.484375

8414087,2,B004326F4G,"The film focused more on this guy's struggle to find time to play and his relationship with his step father.  He wines about being too busy to play and about the strain his playing is taking on his family, yet he finds time to travel to Scotland to experience the history of the game (which adds no value to his goal - I'm sure he could have played a lot of golf and spent quite a nice amount of time with his wife and kids in just the time it took to fly from California to Scotland).

Toward the end of the movie I was wondering if this was a film about golf or a film about a man trying to improve his relationship with his step father.

This guy talked so much about committing to getting better, but I'm 29 years old, work a full time job that requires me to travel and I still manage to play as much golf as he does and I'm not filming a documentary.

His game plan was awful if you ask me.  He spent too much time doing gimmicky things instead of actually practicing intelligently.",1408665600,,988,4.098445595854923
