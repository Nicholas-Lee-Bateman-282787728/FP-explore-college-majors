5008746,5,B006O8K4YO,"I was able to hear Carlos Kleiber several times while living in Munich in the 80's, including performances of ""Rosenkavalier"".  I did not understand how privileged I was until after his death.  I still remember a Rosenkavalier which was scheduled to be conducted by Sawallisch but, unknown to me, he had been taken ill and Kleiber had filled in at short notice.  After 2 or 3 bars of the overture I turned to my companion and stated that this has to be Kleiber - such was the genius of his capability to get such a sound and rhythm from an Orchestra.  This DVD provides a most revealing and respectful glimpse of this great genius without pulling any punches.  This is very highly recommended.  I also have the ""other"" DVD ""I am lost to the World"".  I am very happy to have both of them but if I could have only one it would be this one ""Traces to Nowhere"".",1324080000,4,857,4.352201257861635
5008747,4,B006O8K4YO,"On one level, this film must have been a nightmare for the filmmakers to make, because Carlos Kleiber never gave interviews or ran the PR-gamut that musicians now do.  Thus the only footage of him in action is the rehearsal footage (also featured on another, separate DVD from another company), or still photographs, including rare shots of him with his wife just as regular folks on the street.

However, where the film scores is in getting people like Kleiber's sister, Veronika Kleiber, to reminisce about her brother, where her memories are quite touching.  Likewise, orchestral musicians and opera stage collaborators who aren't big names get to lend their voices, in addition to more celebrated people like Placido Domingo, Brigitte Fassbaender, and Manfred Honeck.  There isn't much in the way of criticism or sniping, as one might expect (except perhaps the one gentle allusion that he was quite the ladies' man, even when married).  But that is a measure of the huge esteem in which fellow musicians and opera stage artists held him, and continue to hold him even after his death.

75 minutes is a somewhat odd length for a film, and some might initially consider it slightly short measure.  However, working with the initial constraint mentioned at the start, this film makes for a good introduction to Carlos Kleiber the person, beyond Carlos Kleiber the musician via his recordings.  By the end, the 75-minute length feels kind of just right.  (Let's hope someone writes a full-scale biography of him at some point.)

BTW, the title is a rough translation of the apparently Chinese/Buddhist concept expressed in the film that one should leave as little trace of one's presence in the world.  Maybe that explains partly why he made so few commercial recordings, or conducted so few concerts in his life.",1314662400,16,1814,4.9933554817275745
5008748,4,B006O8K4YO,"Carlos Kleiber (and also his father Eric) were absolutely great conductors and I always enjoy very much Carlos' recordings (DVD and CD). There is,for me, one unanswered question:
Why did he conduct and record so little? Maybe the answer would be similar to the same question about Glenn Gould. Did ""we"" not always understand their ""souls""? Both biographical DVD about Carlos Kleiber (Traces to nowhere and I am lost to the world) are very good but somewhat repetitive. And their prices are steep if we consider there is relatively little music.",1313884800,6,544,4.989010989010989
5008749,5,B006O8K4YO,"Generally, this document is accurate and those interviewed are interesting.  The whole film seems quite good about not painting a strange picture of the maestro.  The photography is excellent.  It's a very slim film on a fabulous conductor.",1308873600,12,240,5.2631578947368425

8501648,5,B006O8K4YO,"In her book ""La Nilsson"" Birgit Nilsson includes a photograph of her with Carlos Kleiber on a beach in Mexico described as ""bumped into each other"". She further notes that Kleiber, as one of the ""...greatest conductors...has one small flaw that irritates musicians...he is rather stingy with album recordings"". Although they were contemporaries, the discography in that same book does not list any record of any collaboration between them. That is unfortunate indeed as there was some overlap in their preferred repertoire and even in venues, Bayreuth and Vienna, where they both performed. But, of course there may have been some joint appearance that was not recorded. Kleiber was evidently a student of Chinese philosophy and his sister Veronika quotes a favored passage of his from a Chinese source ""...As far as possible you should leave no traces behind in life..."". As his older protective sibling Veronika never gave any interviews during his lifetime, since he did not do so, believing that she should not either. Her insights on her brother provided in this film, however, are nostalgic and personal. This is a marvelous documentary reflecting the unique qualities of one of the most gifted conductors of the Twentieth Century.",1453852800,3,1237,5.19
8501649,4,B006O8K4YO,"On one level, this film must have been a nightmare for the filmmakers to make, because Carlos Kleiber gave only one authorized media interview in his life (which the filmmaker here evidently did not know about), and also never ran the PR-gamut that musicians now do.

72 minutes is a somewhat odd length for a film, and some might initially consider it slightly short measure. However, working with the initial constraint mentioned at the start, this film makes for a good introduction to Carlos Kleiber the person, beyond Carlos Kleiber the musician via his recordings. By the end, the 72-minute length feels kind of just right.

It should be noted that another video documentary about Kleiber appeared at around the same time as this one, namely ""Carlos Kleiber: I Am Lost to the World"", which actually has an audio clip from the one authorized interview that Kleiber gave.  As well, Alexander Werner has published a full-length German-language biography of Kleiber, and Charles Barber has published his own ""Corresponding with Carlos"".

8501652,5,B006O8K4YO,"This  is  a  wonderful  insight  into  the  eccentric  brilliance  of  Carlos  Kleiber.  Many  people  who  worked  with  him  are  interviewed. Generous  excerpts  of  his  conducting  are  included. The  most  expressive  conductor  I  have  ever  seen,  his  formidable  ego  coupled  with  a  nagging  insecurity,  was  always  subservient  to  the  music.",1366502400,2,360,5.428571428571429

8501654,5,B006O8K4YO,"Eric Shulz's documentary seeks to shed some light on the enigmatic figure of Carlos Kleiber, a complicated man both loved by many of the musicians who worked under him, and strongly disliked by many others that worked with him.  Interviews with Placido Domingo, Brigitte Fassbaender, Michael Gielen, Manfred Honeck, Otto Schenk, and Veronika Kleiber (Carlos' sister, giving her first interview about her brother) are featured, as well as excerpts from Mr. Kleiber conducting at various points in his career.  It is truly fascinating to see the man come alive while conducting, and the footage of him explaining to his musicians how a particular section of a piece should be played is amazing - as expressed in the film, it is clear that Mr. Kleiber ""felt"" each piece of music, and his descriptions of how things should be played are rooted in some of the basic examples of our shared human experiences.  This is a conductor that ""gets it"", and it is no wonder that some of his musicians loved him for this.

There is footage of Mr. Kleiber at various points in his career, and in this documentary a picture is painted of a complicated man, full of vitality and childish joys, always on the move, going somewhere, doing something, occasionally intimidating, but at his core shy and caring.  What is most telling is how Placido Domingo speaks about him, with reverence and respect - this listener really wishes he could have attended an early Kleiber concert...it would have been unforgettable.  Kudos to Mr. Shulz for giving us a window into the life of this conducting legend.",1326067200,,1576,4.883895131086143
