3597201,5,B001G6RRB2,"This is a great Westlife DVD! I fell in love with this Irish boy band's music a few months ago and have slowly been adding their DVDs (and CDs) to my music collection.  I've replayed this concert DVD many times. I simply cannot get enough of their vocals and listen to their music nonstop!

For American fans who are unable to travel to the United Kingdom to attend one of their concerts, this DVD is the next best thing to being there.  Go, Westlife!",1261180800,,451,4.345238095238095
3597202,5,B001G6RRB2,"If you're a fan of Westlife, this concert video is probably already in your video library; if it isn't, I urge you to buy it pronto!  The concert footage is dramatic, and you really do feel as if you were one of the 83,000 present at this most exciting event in Dublin, the national stadium of the band's home of Ireland.  The video also includes delightful pre- and post-concert interviews with each of the four lads, and as a bonus, ten of their finest music videos.  And -- if you're NOT already a fan of Westlife (and if you live in the US you may not have even heard of them) -- buy this video anyway; you'll fall in love with this versatile band.  They are the most popular band outside the US; we Americans need to get on board!",1258329600,2,735,4.228571428571429
3597203,5,B001G6RRB2,"I loved this DVD because not only did it show the entire concert, but it also included a documentary that showed the boys preparing for the concert, what it meant to them, and what they did after the concert.  It enabled me to become more familiar with their personalities and to see how genuinely they care about each other and their fans.  I only recently discovered them (in October) and I will be a fan for life. They sing music that can span generations, with no foul language, and with beautiful voices. I think they are great!",1239148800,,533,4.484536082474227
3597204,5,B001G6RRB2,"I just want to say that this dvd is one of the best things I have ever seen! Westlife is my favorite band and I was very excited to see them again and celebrate their and ""our"" 10 years together!
I totally recommend it if you're a fan or not. They are just better and better year after year!
It was so good to remember and back to past listening great songs as Swear it Again e Fool Again! The new ones Something Right and Easy Way!
They look so beautiful and happy! I wish I could be there at that night!
Long life for them!",1234483200,,525,3.9622641509433962
3597205,5,B001G6RRB2,"I ordered this from Amazon because it's not available anywhere in Canada.

If you like Westlife this is an amazing DVD. The production quality is very high and the 5.1 Digital Dolby sound is next to perfect. There is a good mini-feature on the preparations leading up to the Croake park event. There's also top 10 videos as chosen by fans. This was a sold out concert of 83,000!

Congratulations Westlife on 10 years.

From Canada",1233360000,4,430,4.631578947368421

3597207,5,B001G6RRB2,"I look forward to each CD release, but even more to each DVD release to watch the Excellence of Westlife live.
These young men can really sing (live and studio) and frankly are unmatched in providing excellent entertainment in concert.
The Live from Croke Park dvd is the best yet and the others were all great.
A high energy beginning, my absolute favorite portion was The Easy Way. Excellent singing and dancing - the musical version makes you want to get up and dance along- the female dancers were all extreemely cute and dressed similar to westlife to add to the fun not take away from the boys. Special props to the dancer behind Kian- great intensity and having great fun.
An excellent DVD from beginning to end - acoustic set was also awesome!
I watch each DVD over and over again.",1231027200,,789,4.563380281690141

Really superb and exceptionally well-done. I just can't get enough of watching and hearing every track from this concert. Being a Westlife fan since forever, it's sad to know they are going separate ways from now on. This concert exceeded by far all my expectations. I just loved it!",1392940800,,427,4.783783783783784

3597216,1,B001G6RRB2,Not realizing I ordered the PAL Version I could not use this DVD in my player. When I called for help I was told I would have to reset my player settings. Well that can't be done so I have to return. However as always with Amazon my order was on time and in great condition. This one was not their fault. I did not know about the different formats. Now I always check to make sure I get the right one.,1325980800,2,401,3.902439024390244
3597217,5,B001G6RRB2,Westlife is a great outstanding band! The croke park concert was fantastic enjoyed every minute of it. Im from the united states and westlife is not that much known over here but a few fan bases. Wish people would give them a chance becuase they work hard at what they do and they get along and work well with each other. And the shows are great! It's worth going to their concert than any other concert I have been to. Westlife is amazing!,1287360000,,440,4.313253012048193
3597218,3,B001G6RRB2,"I purchased from Amazon and loved the video itself, the concert, the music videos, the behind the scenes footage; BUT towards the end of the concert (can't remember the track number)with only like 4 songs left, the video stops playing. It just stops, doesn't move, and you can't get to the last songs of the concert.  Amazon was very good about exchanging it for another, but it did the same exact thing.  I ended up keeping the video just because I love the rest of it so much.  I found the last 4 concert tracks on youtube so that helps.  hopefully the problem has been corrected, but just beware because I made my purchase not long ago.",1282089600,3,639,4.435897435897436
3597219,5,B001G6RRB2,"This DVD oozes big production! It is a huge celebration of Westlife's 10 years in the business. It's lights camera action, the lads get back-up singers for the first time and they have never looked and sounded better! The fans are so enthuisiastic, you will find yourself singing along in no time.

This DVD has so many bonuses like behind the scenes before the tour and just a general documentary with the guys talking about their journey thus far. This DVD is a MUST for all Westlife fans!!",1277856000,,492,4.590909090909091
8304128,1,B001G6RRB2,First of all the dvd (could be a Pirate Copy) could not be played on my DVD player. The case also is cracked at the bottom. I don't think I deserve a defective item since I paid good money for this dvd. Last time I purchased a DVD of Queen Live at Wembley Stadium and it was fine. Please refund back the total amount back to my credit card ending in 7444. Im a regular customer!,1527033600,,378,3.986842105263158

8304131,4,B001G6RRB2,"I love Westlife but when I received this concert dvd. My dvd player said it was an unsupported disk. That makes no sense what so ever. The only thing I can think of is that sense this dvd was originally made in Ireland. American dvd players won't play it. If that makes any sense. I'm confused by it . If your reading this review and, can tell. :(",1483142400,,347,4.117647058823529

I just wish they would make one more reunion concert. I could not help but move to the songs.",1427328000,,266,4.037735849056604
