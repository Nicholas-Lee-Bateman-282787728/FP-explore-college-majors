8326495,1,B001HDZMKC,"This DVD is a home video of a woman sitting in her living room talking at the camera. There are no helpful learning tools, no discussion with students, no didactic materials at all, just words.  She provides some basic information that can be found from other more professional sources. I think her philosophy and her own birth story are beautiful, but they could have been shared in a much cleaner and more helpful manner.  I wish I had read the reviews before spending 50$.",1228867200,,475,4.642857142857143
8326496,1,B001HDZMKC,This dvd is very poor quality. The videography could have been done by a five year old and we would never know the difference. The lady has good information but she could have explained in 10 minutes what took her 118 minutes! Very longwinded! I could have watched it in fast forward and still have comprehended what she was trying to teach. I was disappointed that I waisted that much time on this dvd.,1228348800,,403,4.45945945945946
