3128570,5,B0014BJ12W,Absolutely great! Down to earth method for learning jazz guitar with an interesting and easy method to learn the rhythm of jazz. I recommend this to everyone who is interesting in learning anything about playing jazz guitar.,1419292800,,224,5.081081081081081
3128571,5,B0014BJ12W,"For about 20 dollars you get a class from one of the best guitar players of all times. I hate using levels, but let's say it is for the intermediate student. She is a good teacher and gives clear explanations about feeling the beat, using guide tones and blues progressions with extended chords. The original tape recording is enhanced with extra features such as looping exercises in slow motion without lowering the pitch. Of course you can get the same thing with the appropriate software, but it's nice to have it prepared for you. Included is also a booklet with the music (chord layout, notes and tab). Highly recommended if you are serious about learning jazz guitar.
If there was an air flight to heaven, I would definitely visit her to take a few lessons.
Emily is one of my favourite guitarist. I have a great admiration for her. One some points I have another opinion than what she explains in this DVD, but that is mainly a matter of taste.
One minor detail: in the booklet there is a small deviation from what she plays in the first part of Summertime (i.e. ex3): she plays a Bm7b5, not a Bm11.",1418947200,,1107,4.512437810945274
3128572,5,B0014BJ12W,I would suggest this for intermediate players. Her discussion of how to develop rhythm is worth the price alone. Plus the buyer will get the hear one of the true greats of jazz.,1408320000,2,177,4.393939393939394
3128573,4,B0014BJ12W,"Your appreciation of this DVD will depend on your level of playing ability. My first reaction was disappointment because I didn't learn any new chord voicings from Emily. But that said, there is plenty to be gained from this DVD. Watching her play her interpretation of Gershwin's Summertime is a real treat!

She refers back to this first lesson in the Advanced/Latin lesson. The Bebop and Swing DVD covers playing on the 2 and 4 beats. The Advanced Jazz and Latin Improvisation DVD covers playing on the 1 and 3 beats.

If you expect a couple of great $20 lessons, you will be very satisfied. If you're looking for a course in Bebop and Swing, then you need a good book and a teacher. Either way, don't pass over these DVDs or you'll miss a great talent and teacher that was not only knowledgeable and experienced, but also very passionate about the music she played and loved. It's very apparent in her teaching and playing.

Knowing how young and tragically Emily left us, makes it hard at times to watch these DVDs, but I'm glad we have this video record of this great Jazz guitar player. ""I saw the needle and the damage done... a little part of it in every one..."" - Neil Young

3128575,5,B0014BJ12W,"I have attended Berklee, and have been playing guitar for about 4 decades!

Over the past 2 decades I have continued, as best I am able, to expand my playing and to take lessons.

Remler is the best type of teacher, in my experience.  One that knows how to simplify a complex subject so that the student can understand without having years of theory, instruction and performance as a foundation.

While primarily a rock, blues, and fingerpicker, I am revisiting my jazz interest.  I found the instruction on this DVD to be enjoyable, down to earth, and most importantly, digestable.  First and most importantly, this is a single DVD and is aimed at a lower or intermediate player, I believe.  There is the assumption of the ability to play chords, notation, and a bit of theory.  If you have none of these it is still a useful tool adn still very usable.

There are several exercises and at least three songs which a player can learn from this video-not only in notation but also simply watching them being played and in half speed mode-and take away the feeling of accomplishment, without a full semester of tutoring.  One reveiwer asserts that this is not instructional in be-bop, but I disagree.  ( I also didn't see anything other than enthusiasm, heart, and candor in Ms. Remler's eyes in both of her instructional videos.)  It begins to lay foundation for be-bop with the presentation of a simple Bb blues, together with discussion of what leading tones are and using leading tones and how they assist in defining chord changes, and teaching how to develop eighth note solos.  An excellent, non-heady, familiar choice, ie a blues, from which to start.

This is worth full price.  It actually can provide a month's worth of practice easily, more if you really work it and perfect it.

Also as noted the emphasis on metronome and rhythm are simple concepts that most players just don't use, or use as much as they should.  This will make it clear why it is critical, and will improve your timing (even if you think you have, or do have, great timing).

The best part, however, is the down to business approach, with heart, humility, and respect for music as well as the student.  Its a very enjoyable experience, and it will improve your playing and will serve those wishing to begin to study jazz to get a tiny taste without being crushed by too much theory, too many exercises in technique, or some of the other foibles of structured musical instruction that can dis-hearten a beginner.

Miss Remler was a great loss, not only as a musician, but as a performer, teacher, and person.",1299542400,28,2588,4.671081677704194
3128576,4,B0014BJ12W,"I wasn't really exposed to Emily's playing style until after her passing. So, for me, all I knew about her came from the static images of photos contained in CD packages, and from her playing style. I have long regretted never being able to have seen her play live, if only to have a chance to encounter the person who inhabited that technique.

This disc goes a long way to providing a bridge to that person. It's an instructional disc, targeted at a guitar player whose level of accomplishment is much more advanced than mine, but what stands out is the person, herself.

Like many other instructional videos, this one starts with the artist deep in the groove, playing a virtuosic introductory piece, and as she concludes it, she finally looks up at the camera and introduces herself. If you're an aspiring player looking at this disc for instruction, it's impossible not to take her seriously after watching her play that number.

Having watched this disc, I finally feel like I know a little about her personality, all charged up with Brooklyn attitude and the intensity of a player whose playing and timing had become second-nature to her. She talks about having graduated from the Berklee College of Music at the age of eighteen, so she undoubtedly inhabited a very competitive environment, and since there weren't a lot of women playing this type of jazz guitar in those days, it's likely that she had to push herself to be that much better than her male colleagues, just to get noticed.

She has no problem dropping the names of other guitar masters who had told her how good her sense of musical time was: guys like Larry Coryell, Herb Ellis and Pat Martino. In fact, while watching this 1986-produced video, I kept thinking about how much she resembled a female Pat Martino-type, and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible. Like Martino, her guitar had become an extension of her very self, and it shows handsomely in this lesson.

She must have been quite a pistol, and if you were ever one of her students on the the guitar, you probably have a few stories to tell about her intensity and commitment to her craft. If you ever had the occasion to have been ""taken to school"" by Remler's guitar instruction, I envy you.

I'll definitely be checking out her other instructional video on Advanced Jazz and Latin Improvisation, and I hope to learn a few things from her, albeit some 20 years after she died.

3128578,5,B0014BJ12W,"First of all, both Emily Remler Hot Licks DVDs are worth buying for their moving end messages and introductory performances alone.
After watching these DVDs you realize what a tragedy her death in 1990 at age 32 was and will probably want to seek out her CD's; some of which are unfortunately out of print.
Both DVDs appear to have been recorded around the same time and I suggest buying both since they cover quite diferent material.
In 'Bebop and Swing' you get a very clear explanation of swing feel, with having metronome and tapping foot on beats 2 and 4 only.
Guide tones are also given a clear explanation, with an assignment of playing guide tone on each beat 1 of Jazz Blues and 'going to Mars and back' in between.
There are a lot of good suggestions throughout DVD and I found myself scribbling notes in the included booklet.
Part of end message in Bebop & Swing DVD is 'Dance while playing, have fun, express emotions, not about competition, music is to be joyous, free, you only have one life...'  Hopefully you can hear message, learn something and be entertained by this DVD.",1213488000,30,1090,4.589743589743589

8254984,5,B0014BJ12W,"I've been a player for a long time... a long, long time.  First off (to me) in the DVD Emily was FUN!  She presents in the DVD a mix of NY attitude (""Hey man, I got it...."") and being a practiced player.  Deceptively so as it seems so ""simple"" when she plays.  That mixture seems to lend itself to being enjoyable to her audience (myself) as she conveyed her message.  There's nothing startling throughout that she presents in this DVD but I enjoyed playing along with her (I mean, who doesn't love 'Summertime' in whatever form it's played??).  I was reminded (for like the millionth time) that practice can be a ""good thing"" resulting in being a better player. And it was a bonus in my view that TAB was part of the package although I always disliked the 'Hot Licks' TAB as it was (more so for me know than when I was younger) REALLY TINY and awkward to read.  I use it as an ""opportunity"" <right....> to rewrite it out where I can print something bigger I can see.  The stuff on the DVD seems a little dated but that's because it is.  It was a different time; different tastes; quite an evolution of players from then till now.  Emily presents solid, foundational stuff that can help any player improve his/her playing.  It was VERY VERY sad that she died so early in her life.  The DVD doesn't really present it because that's not the purpose but Emily was a monster player.",1524873600,,1378,4.381889763779528
