I recently viewed  ""The Russians are Coming, The Russians are Coming"", and I was impressed with JPL's performance.  But, his acting (acting??) in ""Cold Heat"" is horrific, bland and amateurish!  The opening sequence looks as though it was shot out of a car window.  This entire movie  --  from the story line to the acting is pathetic.",1167177600,,414,4.652777777777778
