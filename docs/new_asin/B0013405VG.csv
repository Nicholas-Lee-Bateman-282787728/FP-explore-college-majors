8570323,1,B0013405VG,The 12 minute 60 Minutes story was interesting and informative.  I think a 12 minute DVD is a bit too short.  That is 1 60 Minutes story.  Other 60 Minute stories should have been included.  Ideally other related type stories from over the many years of the show would have been a much better value.,1204243200,5,299,4.381818181818182
