4189927,4,B003SZUJT6,"""Five Star Final"" is an expose of the morals of journalism which still holds true today. With superb Edward G. Robinson as the editor of the Gazette, the film investigates the repercussion of resurrecting a 20 year old murder case and the effect on the acquitted murderess and her family. There are really only 2 sets; Robinson's office and the home of the victims. Aline MacMahon, making her debut, inhabits the former as Robinson's secretary and she is outstanding, brilliantly conveying a whole life behind the facade of wise cracks and yearning for her boss. Boris Karloff, before hitting his fame in the monster genre, creates a particularly slimy character as Izapod, the bogus preacher and lecher who positively salivates at the destruction he causes. Marian Marsh plays the daughter of the murderess whose life is destroyed by the journal's actions. The climax of the film is her diatribe and she too is outstanding. The weakest link of the film is the antique acting styles of H. B. Warner and Frances Starr who seem to be from a different film and era. This may be due to the weak direction by Mervyn Le Roy for their scenes are staged very unimaginatively. In fact, the direction is mediocre all the way through but the players and the pungent script rise above it.

The film has been issued in the Warner's Archive Collection which means it is very expensive, unrestored and contains no extras.  In this case, the theatrical trailer is included and the film has been remastered.  Note that remastered is NOT the same as restored for while the print and soundtrack are clear, it is not clean, stable or repaired.",1295136000,5,1623,4.789285714285715
4189928,5,B003SZUJT6,"This 1931 pre-code depicts how ""The Gazette"" a sordid ""yellow press"" muckraking newspaper destroys one family's lives in the quest to raise their weekly circulation numbers. The newspaper owner {Mr. Hinchecliffe }intends to retry ""re-fry it  hot"" a 20 year old shooting incident of a women's lover by running a serial series {The Love Mad Stenographer} that will dredge  back up the whole affair. The women {Nancy Voorhees} had been acquitted, subsequently married, had a daughter and is living a quiet and respectable life. The newspaper owner hypocritically rationalizes that this series will be a moralistic and cautionary human interest tale for shop girls and secretaries ""not to fall in love with their boss"".

Edward G. Robinson portrays the newspaper's editor - Mr. Randall who has tried to eschew this kind of sensationalized  journalism but goes along with the owner {his nickname for him is the ""Sultan of Slop""} to make this the  newspapers major news story to be played up. Randall  immediately warms up to the task and has a new female reporter  Miss Carmody {Ona Munson} tramping the streets to get anything she can and playing it up as a filthy mess by putting Voorhees on trial again { via the Gazette} as a murderess for a crime  for which she  had been acquitted .  And play it up they will for as Randall's secretary Miss Taylor {a wry, cynical excellent performance by Aline  MacMahon} comments - ""I think you can always get people interested in the crucifixion of a women"".

The newspaper will use and does anything necessary to  get into the women's/families past and present - even to the point of planting a newspaper reporter as a phony minster to gain the families confidence and get ""dirt"" on them. This reporter {Mr. Isobod} is well played with a slimy, hypocritical relish by a ""pre-Frankenstein"" Boris Karloff. Voorhees has a 20 year old daughter that is about to be married, She is terrified that her past {which her daughter knows nothing about {which includes that her daughter is illegitimate from the man that she shot will be discovered. The newspaper gets going full blast and in a week the family is under the microscope and under siege. The daughter, Jenny Townsend {a surprisingly effective performance by Marian Marsh} learns everything and fears that she will lose her parents and her fianc' because of the scandal.

Isabod, posing as a kindly, concerned minister gains access to the family and gets the lowdown on the forthcoming marriage and much else. The despair of the parents as the pressure mounts is too much {sympathetically played by H.B Warner and Frances Starr}so when the mother is found dead from committing suicide, the father in his despair also takes his own life. That is just more grist for the mill when Miss Carmody and a photographer break into the parents apartment, find them dead, phone in the story and it is a page one blowout story complete with pictures of the corpses. When Randall hears about the suicide he knows that the paper is directly responsible for the deaths by digging up the old story.

This leads to the astonishingly tense, scathing and shattering climax of the film when Jenny Townsend faces down Randall, Hinchecliffe and Isobode with the question ""why did you kill my mother"" and demands that the omnipotent publisher raise her parents from the dead since the newspaper can solve any problem. Marian Marsh is an unknown actress today but in her agonized, semi- controlled,  hysterical  denunciation  -  in  this scene she  really lets herself  go and  her performance here  is  worthy of Betty Davis -  marvelous.  She is just stopped in shooting them by her fianc { a stiff Anthony Bushnell}  who tells them that they have gorged on misery and blood and that no one has had  the courage to ""crush them  back into the earth"". After they leave,  E.G. Robinson then goes it one better with one of the greatest  short performances of his career - a  controlled, agonized , white hot angry tirade to Hinchecliffe in condemning  himself and Hinchecliffe as ""degenerate assassins, diseased hypocrites and berates himself for his 10 years of blood soaked  service to the newspaper and quits  right on the spot. Miss Taylor  who has quietly loved  him also quits just as another sensational story comes to Randall's desk  - a double  homicide  with the murderer committing suicide.

This is an excellent and still  relevant  film that highlights that even 80 years ago {before the internet ,Google and 24 hour news channels} that's sensationalized, scandalized news that celebrates misery and caters to mindless readers was alive, well and just like today SELLS BIG TIME !!!. Edward G. Robinson is {as usual} outstanding as the driven, hard  drinking, tormented editor with a ""Pontus Pilate"" complex - washing  his  hands  20 times a day as  if to  clean the  muck of the job off them. There is the usual sharp dialogue, face pace and tight editing that is typical of 1930s Warner Brothers movies. I give this movie an enthusiastic 5 star and highly recommend it - This film is truley excellent.",1279324800,16,5077,4.852153667054715

4189933,4,B003SZUJT6,"Interesting look at the ethics of journalism. While it was wildly absurd, the film had enough elements of truth to give it value. It is, of course, a period piece, so much of what happened in the film isn't necessarily what journalists would do today. But the film is not a documentary; it's a drama, starring a classic actor.

The film holds up. This was one of Mr. Robinson's favorite films as it is one of mine.  Yes it's melodramatic by our standards today but so what?  This is one powerful film.  To watch Mr. Robinson in the last few moments of the film when he tells his employers what he thinks of them and how the news business has become so jaded and corrupt, makes you think, because what has changed?  A fine film with a most excellent actor and supported by some very fine actors.  H.B. Warner, Boris Karlof, directed by Mervyn LeRoy, you will not be disappointed.",1369785600,,712,4.2611940298507465
4189937,3,B003SZUJT6,"<strong>Five Star Final</strong> (Mervyn LeRoy, 1931)

If you're a fan of Edward G. Robinson's (and if you're not, you should be), you've gotta get your hands on this ridiculously over-the-top melodrama, made very early in Mervyn LeRoy's career and nominated for the best Picture Oscar in 1932 (it lost, and deservedly, to <em>Grand Hotel</em>). Robinson plays Randall, the newly-installed editor of a New York tabloid who wants to turn the paper in a more traditional direction, so he assigns muckraker Vern Isipod (Boris Karloff) to the society pages. You can see where this could go wrong, and indeed it does, in record time, with Isipod attempting to dig up dirt on a socialite in order to prevent her upcoming society marriage--and in the process causing her family irreparable harm. There is much scenery-chewing from everyone involved, an insipid script delivered with great gusto by the cast, and that still-early-in-the-world-of-talkies overexpression rampant. It's ridiculous fun. ***",1347321600,,994,5.412903225806452
4189938,4,B003SZUJT6,"Warner Bros. Pictures and A First National-Vitaphone Picture presents ""FIVE STAR FINAL"" (1931) (89 min/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Starring Edward G. Robinson, Marian Marsh, H.B. Warner, Anthony Bushell, George E. Stone, Frances Starr, Ona Munson &  Boris Karloff

Directed by Mervyn LeRoy

Robinson plays a ruthless, yet conscience-ridden editor, who too late realizes that crusading journalism - investigative reporting we call it these days - is often just a pretext for pandering to the vulgar publics taste for road kill.

The cynical, rapid-fire dialogue gives it an edge and an authenticity that's almost impossible to recapture these days and, needless to say, became one of the key elements in this type of film.

Robinson's last scene is a tour de force of cathartic fury, which director Mervin LeRoy frames effectively, so that the audience shares in the emotional release. Seemingly incapable of giving a bad performance, Robinson fascinates as he chews the scenery with his full-throttle performance.

Ona Munson plays plays a prostitute, 8 years before she played a Madame in ""Gone with the Wind"" and Oscar-nominated actress (""Dragon Seed"") Aline MacMahon in her first film.

Robinson was absolutely brilliant in the role and ably assisted by Boris Karloff - in an odd turn as an alcoholic reporter just prior to his star-making role in ""Frankenstein"" - have acting in the age of sound down to a fine art.

8404802,5,B003SZUJT6,"The transaction was great, and the Item arrived Super Fast..  I love this film...because it told the TRUTH about  ""Yellow Journalism"" and its ugliness, almost 90 years before ""Reality TV"".  It tells the story of a reasonably decent newspaper editor who works for a Tabloid in danger of going under.  To sell copies, he digs up a 20 year old story of a young mother who kills in order to protect her child.  The woman serves her time, and lives a quiet life with her family, until the old story is spread around all over again.  This is a Pre-Code film that tells it like it is, and it's amazingly frank for 1931.  Edward G. Robinson is superb as the editor, and Marian Marsh is Spectacular as the now grown daughter of the Convicted woman. Lastly, you get the added treat of the young Boris Karloff....before he became famous.",1518998400,,826,4.503355704697986

8404805,4,B003SZUJT6,"Recently, I had the chance to see this classic 1931 movie. A friend of mine loaned it to me and I watched it a second time. In summary, it is about an editor and newspaper operation that is desperate to increase its circulation. They dig up an old story of a woman who was acquitted about 20 years ago for murdering a man who would not marry her. She had his child and married someone else. Her daughter and her fiance did not know about the murder and had been reared to believe that her step-father was her actual father.
The intent of the paper was to increase its circulation with no regard for destroying this woman's reputation. It is tragic as the mother and subsequently her husband joins her by committing suicide as they are overwhelmed with grief on the day of their daughter's wedding! When discovered dead in their bedroom by a reporter from the newspaper, the reporter actually had the dishonorable conduct to insist on taking a picture of their remains to promote the story developing for the proliferation of sales. Meanwhile, the daughter's fiance's parents both objected to their son marrying the daughter of a murderer, but the son persists and does follow through with the marriage despite their arrogant opposition.
I liked how this movie shows how some people in the media have no morals or objective standards. They are out to destroy people's reputations and lives with no regard or consideration simply to increase circulations and popularity. I was disappointed that both parents committed suicide on the day of their daughter's wedding. Kudos to the editor Randall, played by Edward G. Robinson for resigning from such an operation. ""Why did you kill my mother?"" was the dramatic question numerously asked that confronted those who participated in this. This is a movie that is worth watching and it also features Boris Karloff.",1489968000,,1855,4.854889589905363
