8716493,5,B00XQD5WIS,"Pat's videos are very entertaining. While the Punk character isn't as funny as AVGN, he's a different kind of funny and VERY informative which is awesome. He's passionate about it and it shows. I also noticed that these DVDs are not edited, as far as I can tell anyways from the online versions. The copy righted material tends to be in tact, at least with the music it is. If they are then I have not picked up on it yet.
You get 9 episodes, all of which are amusing. Some cameos from other online reviewers pop up which is always a welcome treat if you follow them too. Frank is right in the mix which him alone could probably be profitable! Hilarious guy! Ian can be a little dry/bland but serves the purpose for the part he plays.
The extras are great additional bonus. Flea Market Madness is always great, Pat has an eye for deals and can spot the crooks. Again, it's informative and something I would take into consideration if I were at a flea market shopping for games and figures. There's some Comic Con footage in there from Pat's visit there, again, entertaining and funny. AVGN makes a hilarious bonus mini review appearance during one of Pat's NES Marathons as he normally does.
If you're a fan of Pat's or online retro video game reviews then this is worth owning. I own all of them and have not been disappointed yet! Keep up the great work Pat!",1471564800,,1360,4.422310756972111
