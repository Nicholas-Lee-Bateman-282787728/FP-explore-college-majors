3002732,4,B000XJD38O,"Sure, Commander Hamilton has plenty of shoot-em-up action, but unlike the cover art lead me to believe, the plot is a bit more intricate, and the acting and production a level or two higher than I expected.  It has been enough years that the film could be a look into contemporary history, i.e., a play on the then current events of the Reagan years conflict with Lybia, worry about the security of the post USSR nuclear arsenal, and Windows 95 era computers, but the movie still felt fresh and entertaining.",1379030400,,508,4.644444444444445
3002733,3,B000XJD38O,"The movie COMMANDER HAMILTON was not all that bad. The movie had some problems in that it was obviously dubbed and hard to understand at times and the plot was formulaic but the action was good in some scenes and at times reached the level of a James Bond movie. Also, Mark Hamill makes a pretty good villain, sort of like Luke Skywalker gone to the dark side. There's a gross scene at the beginning of the movie involving chain saws and body parts but I didn't think it was that bad. This movie was made in the late '90s and is somewhat dated now so you can get it cheap. I bought my copy for three bucks. I spent an evening watching it and enjoyed it far more than the usual stuff on TV. I think I got my money's worth out of it, so while it isn't a great movie it was entertaining enough to earn three stars.",1277683200,6,811,4.075

It certainly was not realistically delivered.  The story line was pretty good.  It did seem like a James Bond movie without the sexuality.  No sex and I detected no bad language.  There is a lot of violence and some really gruesome scenes, especially near the front of the movie.  The music was OK; but not great.  The scenery was appropriate for the movie.  This had a complex plot and was a spy thriller; almost two stories.  Though probably not for children; this movie has my recommendation as a good spy thriller.  I liked it.

Reminds a bit of Shoot'Em Up or Trollhunter (with a Scandinavian sense of humor).

3237383,3,B000XJD38O,This appears to be a foreign language film with English voiceover - either that or Prime Video was having a terrible day keeping in sync. As it is I think some of the dialogue suffered in translation. The base story is good and it shows many reasons why foreign governments are cagey about dealing with the CIA since it always seems to end in a loose - loose result.,1456531200,,366,4.318840579710145

It certainly was not realistically delivered.  The story line was pretty good.  It did seem like a James Bond movie without the sexuality.  No sex and I detected no bad language.  There is a lot of violence and some really gruesome scenes, especially near the front of the movie.  The music was OK; but not great.  The scenery was appropriate for the movie.  This had a complex plot and was a spy thriller; almost two stories.  Though probably not for children; this movie has my recommendation as a good spy thriller.  I liked it.

Reminds a bit of Shoot'Em Up or Trollhunter (with a Scandinavian sense of humor).
