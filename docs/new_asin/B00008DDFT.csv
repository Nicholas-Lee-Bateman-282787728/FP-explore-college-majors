7982007,5,B00008DDFT,"Yuzuriha's past has been lonely. Being the only one who can see her spirit dog, the others in her age group have always looked at her as a weirdo. She begins to have strong feelings for Kusanagi, though she doesn't know that he's the enemy. Kamui also makes an important decision. When he does the divine sword appears; but at a terrible cost.

This is an excellent series. It has action, drama, and suspense. The animation, plot, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. There are also lots of great characters and plot twists. I try to be objective and think of just 1 bad thing to say about this series, but I can't. This is an all around incredible story. CLAMP has done it again! This is a must see for every anime fan.",1355184000,,731,4.4148148148148145
7982008,5,B00008DDFT,"The outline that follows is an outline that refers to the entire series and spoilers will be included.

To begin with, if you are looking for an anime that is more in the style of Love Hina, than you should skip this one. If on the other hand, you are looking for an anime that is powerful, emotional, has love/romance, great character development and strong story, than you are definitely right here.

Outline of the story:

The story resolves around the Seven guardians of Heaven and the Seven guardians of Earth. The one group wants to preserve earth as it, believes in humanity no matter what they have done to earth, and hope for a better future. The other group wants to erase humanity from the face of earth so that the planet and its other creatures can life in peace etc.

The `problem' is that when watching the show you will - like it or not - agree with both groups (not to mention the fact that there is no `black - white answer' but a grey version (You will have to watch it in order to understand or otherwise I will give the entire show away, sorry guys)). Apart from it, the age of the group members does not matter much; meaning that you will see in both groups' teenagers and adults fighting side-by-side or against each other till death. Others will fight against the other group for their own personal reasons.

The biggest problem however is that there can be only one Kamui (chosen one) and the side he decides to follow will win; but, it proofs that the real Kamui has a twin star, meaning that there is another Kamui out there as well. This will lead to an explosive mixture of emotions. Lovers, who will belong to the opposing group, will be forced to fight till death against each other, brother against brother, best friend against best friend and so forth. To be honest, the story will get very emotional indeed. No matter the age, the group members will fight and die.

As for the action, you will get more than enough. To begin with, the fights occur in both astral plane and our materialistic world. In order to prevent damages in our world, the group members are able to form a kind of a shield, in which most fights happen, and no matter the destruction our reality remains unaltered. That is, if the fights remain inside the shield, something that will not always be the case. In addition, all group members have their own supernatural `super powers' etc. For instance, some can use the five elements, some others are psychics, some others use magic, some take advantage of technology, some bend reality etc.

Who will win in the end and what will be the cost of this destructive victory?

The genre of this anime could be categorized under: fantasy, supernatural, action, and love / romance.

The music that accompanies the show is very well orchestrated and good. Starts with a rock/pop song and ends up with a melancholic ballad. In-between the music changes in accordance with the shows (very good done).

As for the dub, in my humble opinion, it is very good and professional done, in the same level as CB is done.

The animation is excellent.

As for extras, it has more or less the typical stuff: Textless opening and ending, previews, trailers etc.

As for the box-set: The first DVD comes with the box and every DVD you buy it fits in there; imagine it something like a shelf.

As for the story: It is very emotional, has great character development, solid storyline (that moves forth and back, with flashbacks etc.), many twists and is very mature and character driven.

Tip: The first episode, called X-0, of the first DVD is like a prelude and `summation' of the story. If you don't want anything to be given to you in front but want to be glued to your sits from episode one, that skip this one.

Last but not least, is it worth buying or not? In two words: Definitely yes! However, by collecting all 8 volumes the cost may raise around $200. To be honest, it is worth having in your collection but if the cost might seem to you as an obstacle than try to rent it and to watch it.  The show is highly recommended!

I hope that I could help you, if so than please click on the yes button below ^_^",1156118400,,4144,4.466225165562914
7982009,5,B00008DDFT,"The first episode is kind of dull. It tells about Yuzuriha's childhood and her invisible spirit dog, Inuki. But the other two make up for it. The second episode tells how Kamui's mother died and what she told him to do, the second divine sword is born in this episode. The third episode is a milestone episode. Kamui finally picks a side!!! And Fuma awakens as the other Kamui. I'm not going to tell which side he picked. The ending of this volume is rather sad, someone is killed by a Dragon of Earth. I love this volume, check it out.",1058140800,,536,4.316831683168317
7982010,5,B00008DDFT,"X the TV show is a wonderful, well thought out anime that is both intelligent and action packed.
  This is the pivotal DVD in the X series. Kamui chooses what side he is going to fight for. This makes Fuma's choice for him. And once that happens, Fuma wastes no time. The actions he takes will forever alter Kamui's life. And certainly alter the future of the world.
  X, up to this point has been beautiful and surreal. The episodes on this DVD change the mood of the show. And sets a new darker tone for the remainder of the series. The events that occur in this one are harsh and cruel. But then again this show is about the end of the world.",1057795200,,645,4.17741935483871
7982011,4,B00008DDFT,"This DVD is just another DVD of a great series. The DVD X [One] blew me away and I immediately bought this DVD as well. This was almost a let-down. It's not a shot at the series, but to the people who are organizing these DVDs for American release. I am seriously sick and tired of 3-episode DVDs. We all know they can put at least 5 episodes on one DVD and when they put 3, they're trying to scam more money from me. For our [item price] we at least deserve 4 episodes!
Great series, but these DVD's aren't really worth the money unless you're really into it. I can't justify [that much] to an episode.",1054684800,,603,4.162393162393163
7982012,5,B00008DDFT,"One of interesting episodes that will no doubt get lost amongst the more dramatic episodes is 'Inuki.'  This is Yuzuriha Nekoi's story.  As a child, this Dragon of Heaven acquired an invisible friend a puppy named Inuki, whose duty was to protect her.  It always hurt her that no one else could see Inuki.  The delight of her coming to Tokyo was discovering that the other Dragons could see the dog.  Especially Kusanagi Shiyu, one of the few sympathetic Dragons of Earth.
The remaining two episodes delineate the crisis point of this series - Kamui's decision.  The interactions between Kamui, Kotori, and Fuma are lovingly detailed, as the second Shinken makes its appearance and the inexorable mid-point is reached.  These are terrible events whose repercussions drive the remainder of the series.  The viewer will have to forgive me for being as mysterious as possible.
One of the things worth musing on at this point is how negatively the Dragons of Earth are painted.  In reality, they represent the divine urge to sweep all away and start over, while the Dragons of Heaven speak for the need to care and preserve.  Shiva and Vishnu, ever in conflict, but both needed.  As such, I am surprised that they are very nearly cast as the villains.  Regardless of the final resolution of the series, neither side represents evil, nor should either be allowed to rule on its own.  It will be interesting to see how Yoshiaki Kawajiri brings this to closure.
In any case, this continues to be a brilliant, disquieting series that speaks with both metaphor and action.  This effort is amazingly superior to the jagged presentation of the film.  And continually lives up to its artistic promise.  I'm glad the decision was made to create this reinterpretation.  Of course, by now, you have discovered the same thing yourself.",1050364800,9,1819,4.872964169381108
7982013,5,B00008DDFT,"These episodes are truly amazing.  They continue the X tradition of stunning animation, interesting characters, and gorgeous music.  The ending is shocking and unforgettable.  It sets in motion the rest of the series.  This is a pivotal DVD no fan should be without.  Here on out the war for the fate of the world begins.  The dragons of earth and the dragons of Heaven are all ready for the final battle.  I CAN'T WAIT for the next DVD.",1049414400,4,437,4.5256410256410255
