8407225,5,B003W1QFPI,"The star of this film is incredible. She plays someone with what seems like a reasonable family/husband relationship.

Her facial expressions and emotions as the changes in gopher live occur are an interesting and sometimes amusing interpretation of how to deal with those situations. And her relationship with her best friend is sweet, intense, funny and moving.

Her choices as her life changes she handles as someone her age might and again she does it with true emotion and when called for fun.

A truly enjoyable film. Saw it a year or two ago and have been trying to buy it since. It was hard to find, but finally did it. Showed it to friends and we had a great evening enjoying her performance and the overall film.

Buy this film now before it disappears.",1391385600,,763,4.62962962962963
8407226,4,B003W1QFPI,"Mercedes (Llia Cabral) is facing a mid-life crisis. She has grown apart from her husband who she believes is having an affair. Her best friend Monica (Alexandra Richter) takes her under her wing as Mercedes tries to enjoy life outside of her self gratifications thinking about Mel Gibson (most likely the younger Mel Gibson). Her story is told to us as she discusses her life with a therapist, one she insists she doesn't need.

The film is billed as a comedy, and indeed it has some humorous scenes such as when the women are talking about self gratification ignoring the young male waiter standing over their table with his mouth agape...""Will that be check or cash?"" Mercedes admits she did not cry when her mother died...and doesn't cry over death. The therapist attempts to come back to this, but Mercedes claims it is meaningless. ** MINI PLOT SPOILER**Indeed, it isn't until Mercedes does cry over the death of someone, that she can realize she really is happy.

It is an interesting indie style film. The humor had me laughing only a few times. Much of the humor was Hispanic schtick, consisting of physical humor. The biggest obstacle to enjoying this film was of course the subtitles.  Worth a view if you enjoy the indie style and can handle subtitles (or know Portuguese). 3 1/2 stars.
