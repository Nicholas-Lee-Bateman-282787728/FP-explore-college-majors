8048203,2,B0007LFPUW,"Problems with playback, as indicated in some reviews. Disk one will not playback the launch and disk 6 will not playback the splashdown. These were tested on several different players. My set was purchased brand new and factory sealed, the disk surfaces are perfect. Fortunately most of the moonwalks play. Some disks freeze and stop prior to the end of the recordings. I'm not sure just how much of the moonwalks are unwatchable. This would be a 5-star review, if not for the manufacturing defects. I would recommend contacting Spacecraft Films to get reassurance that these defects will be corrected with the new pressing due out in fall of 2010.",1283385600,,648,4.9
8048204,1,B0007LFPUW,"I purchased this set and then discovered that several sections would not play, either in my Mac or my Toshiba dvd player.  The defective dvd's cause my Mac and dvd player to completely freeze up, and the only option to correct the problem is to unplug the power cord.  When I contacted Spacecraft Films, they refused to believe me, and refused to replace the faulty dvd's.  My recommendation to you is, DO NOT purchase from this company!",1269734400,,437,4.64935064935065
8048205,3,B0007LFPUW,"I recently purchased this Apollo 16 6-DVD set and was looking forward to seeing a detailed documentary of this moon landing, only to discover that all six discs have manufacturing defects.  I took note of problem areas on each disc (freezing, chapters not starting) and tried the discs in four different brand DVD players (JVC, Panasonic, Sony, Philips).  All players had playback problems in all the same locations on the discs.  The discs look physically in excellent condition.  I didn't attempt to watch the discs all the way through, just where I encountered the first problems.  There may be more problems than what I found.  From what I was able to watch, I did find the material much more interesting than the Apollo 11 3-DVD set.  My review is 3 stars, but would be 5 stars if the product wasn't so defective.  I contacted the manufacturer (that's where I purchased it) a week ago- no response yet.  This set is a hard to find and expensive item- just be aware there was a manufacturing defect that wasn't addressed.  On all six discs?  It has to be.",1251072000,2,1059,4.639784946236559
8048206,5,B0007LFPUW,"In combination with the superb (and free online) Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, this video set offers remarkable insight into the Apollo 16 mission, which stands unchallenged as the definitive exploration of the Moon's ancient highland province. For excellent and highly readable books that explain the scientific planning and minute-by-minute execution of the mission traverses, I also highly recommend Don Wilhelms'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/To-a-Rocky-Moon-A-Geologist-s-History-of-Lunar-Exploration/dp/0816514437/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration</a>&nbsp;and David Harland's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Exploring-the-Moon-The-Apollo-Expeditions-Springer-Praxis-Books-Space-Exploration/dp/0387746382/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Exploring the Moon: The Apollo Expeditions (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)</a>.
Of all the Spacecraft Films video sets this Apollo 16 set is easily my favorite. Listen for the marvelous personal interaction between Mission Commander John Young, arguably this planet's single most accomplished space man, and Lunar Module Pilot Charlie Duke. Duke, with his nasal southern twang, is clearly a jolly garrulous fellow (and he has a few ""rats"" moments that may make you laugh out loud). They make one hilariously odd couple, because Young, in contrast, is always all business and circumspect with his every word. Think Clint Eastwood, circa 1980, but hiking around on the lunar highlands; with a wide-eyed and witty Barney Fife (or maybe Sancho Panza?) along as his sidekick. By the way, Young must have been mortified when it turned out to be he who committed the costly error of tripping over a cable, which KO'ed the important heat flow experiment. Of course, the superlative Mr Young went on to become the Chief of NASA's Astronaut Office and fly as Commander of the very first Shuttle flight in 1981.",1222387200,,1991,6.632183908045977
8048207,5,B0007LFPUW,"This is an essential tool for every Apollo researcher, real space modeler and space enthusiast. The complete downlink series has the entire TV footage, plus training and a few stills. You can appreciate every detail of the EVA's and the Rover routs. The deployment of the ASLEP, The problem with Heat and Flow experiment, and the Big Navy salute, were John Young leaps in the air, famous Lunar Rover Grand Prix, transposition and docking, Trans-Earth EVA of Ken Mattingly, CSM and LM in lunar orbit, lunar lift-off. The chapter sections are chronologically arranged, and subchapters allow you to review film magazine pictures, assembled moon landscape panoramas, and the separate 16 mm films. You get the pre-flight tests, suit-ups, multi angle launch views of the Saturn V rocket, mid flight downlinks, news conferences, splashdown recovery and even CM lunar survey film footage.

Spacecraft films have made a wonderful job. The set contain every footage of the mission, no the mix of several Apollo mission footage, generally trying to represent one entire flight. You have to acknowledge that in some part there is not Audio with out documental music, The voice are the original.

You will have over 12 hours of the Entire Apollo 16 Mission

8048208,5,B0007LFPUW,"This six disc DVD set is really superb. The video has been taken from the master tapes but one still has to realize that these images where taken in 1972 and with regards to the TV images transmitted from the moon. Although already enhanced, I personally add my own video touch with real-time noise filters and video equalizer settings to really enhance the experience. I recommend watching these discs while keeping the press release kit info at hand (see lunar surface journal online) for some summary info about the purpose of the scenes.

Also includes a great landing site and traverse flyover animation to set the EVA context.

Again definitely great material for everyone with great interest for the Apollo missions.",1164153600,4,723,4.966942148760331
8048209,5,B0007LFPUW,"An incredible six DVD set encompassing the next to last manned flight to the moon in April, 1972. Mark Gray's Spacecraft Films has realized a dream for many Apollo Freaks that have wanted the best quality footage and video availiable of America's early space missions. Previously released bootleg videos of the Apollo moonwalks were copied from grainy film kinescopes, not the master videotapes. For this new set, Spacecraft Films made sure that nearly all of the lunar EVA video had been digitally enhanced and remastered from the master two-inch videotape reels that were stored at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. This results in that ""live as it happened"" look that only original master videotape can give you. Bravo, Spacecraft Films!",1128643200,10,743,5.148760330578512
8048210,5,B0007LFPUW,"I've just went through this marvelous material and it's absolutely fantastic. I own earlier two disc set which can serve as an apetizer to this complete and full of rare material collection.

You have here several unique footages you find nowhere else. First of all it's a famous Lunar Rover Grand Prix with John Young driving the rover up to its limits - really breathtaking and - this is the only footage of the rover taken ever. Reason is obvious - TV camera was always attached to the rover so the only coverage could be made by an astronaut equiped with the DAC camera ( Charlie Duke in this case).

Lunar EVAs are 100% complete covered either by Rover TV or DAC camera during transfers between the lunar stations ( TV would not work during the transfers due to bumpy drive making the pointing of the rover parabolical transmission antena towards the Earth impossible). Apollo 16 astronauts covered most of the transfers, however, some of them are a little bit ""jumpy"" - probably the DAC camera did not work 100% correctly - but it's an unique and excellent document and the rest of the transfers is covered perfectly. Again - Apollo 16 was very unique in this way. You can watch the EVAs without interruption as they happened 33 years ago in Descartes region of the Moon - very nice.

Another rare footage is dismantling and repair of the CSM after the Saturn V stack was returned to VAB from the pad and second roll-out in a windy and really very rainy weather - I believe this was the only Apollo Saturn V roll-out during such bad weather.

Audio is also excellent, e.g.you have the opportunity to listen to the CSM-LM discussion behind the Moon after discovering the SPS problem nearly killing the landing opportunity.

All other ""usual"" footages are here - all kind of training, launch day activities, multi-angle launch coverage, transposition and docking, Trans-Earth EVA of Ken Mattingly, CSM and LM in lunar orbit, lunar lift-off, all in splendid quality. Landing and recovery section is complete with nice shots of CSM on parachutes from helicopters and main recovery ship including splashdown, helicopter pick-up and the speaches of the astronauts on board.

Audio is (except of few minutes) everywhere, accompanying brochure is very well done with all chapters named and timings given - big help for watching. Well, you simply MUST have it, nothing else can compete the completeness and quality of this material, great job from Spacecraftfilms !

One more comment - all Spacecraftfilms DVDs are Region 0, so do not be discouraged by info given by Amazon that this DVD is Region 1. It's zero and you can play it anywhere.
