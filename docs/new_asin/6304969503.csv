But there is the occasional,rare,piece of garbage to emerge,and this is definitely it. First lets try to sum up the plot. Oh wait,I forgot there is no freakin' plot. The whole movie is about this big dumb battleship. This battleship is supposed to be mankind's last chance for survival. The enemies that are threatening the earth are these big,dumb things that look like giant magnets,and they are led by this broad called""Avatar"".Anyway the hero in the story is this stupid pilot and this wench who loves to scream Avatar's name. If I have to hear that again,I'll go nuts. Anyhow,I'll sum it up like this,this movie was so boring that I fell asleep during the middle of it and when I woke up,there was still 2 hours left. In conclusion,STAY AWAY FROM THIS KRAP.",979344000,,905,4.524390243902439

7879936,3,6304969503,"This Toho movie is a cross between Atragon, The Mysterians and Space Battleship Yamato.  However, you may feel that you have been dropped into the action, like this is the middle of a trilogy, with not enough background and no satisfactory conclusion.  If you like scifi tech extravaganzas without being too demanding, you can enjoy the ride.",1352937600,,342,4.982456140350878

7879938,3,6304969503,"Hey, for $7 (at Fry's), I thought this was a bangin' deal. I'm not gonna repeat what the synopsis said but I think this is something cool enough for a teenager or an adult action buff to appreciate. Yeah, the story would toss out factoids left and right and if you're not into all that jumping around trying to puzzle pieces together then this movie would just turn you off near the end. BUT, for $7, ya can't beat it with my granny's whip.",1141084800,,440,4.25
7879939,3,6304969503,"Last weekend I watched an interesting bit of anime called Super Atragon the Motion Picture.  Super Atragon is based upon one of Japan's best-selling science fiction novels.
During the Second World War, Japan built a powerful submarine named the Ra.  On its maiden voyage it ran afoul of a similar ship from the United States named the Liberty.  Both ships disappeared.  Then, many years later, strange events in Antarctica are causing the ice sheets to break up and move north.  Investigating ships are destroyed by a gravity lens that can focus a beam from a tower rising out of the South Pole.  It is then that the undersea battleship Ra makes its reappearance.
The Ra was built using a new energy source that was discover when a strange object crashed in the Japanese countryside in 1933.  Shortly after construction began a young woman appeared who claimed to have knowledge of the new energy source.  Unknown to the Japanese, similar events occurred in the United States.  Now, as the Earth comes under siege from an unknown enemy, the Ra appears to be the only hope of survival.
As the enemy works to complete a ring around the planet that will produce microwave rays to destroy the surface dwellers, the Ra must make its mission known while trying to stay an independent force.  The enemy turns out to be dwellers from the Earth's interior and the new energy source was a test to see if the surface humans should be allowed to live.  Using the energy to build warships was a bad move.  But the woman helping the Japanese decides to protect the humans.  In a climactic battle for the fate of the Earth, the Liberty reappears and the fate of the Earth is about to be decided.
A very good film with a strong plot and excellent cinematography.  The creators of this movie definitely know how to use image to express ideas.  I felt this one was superior to most of the anime I have seen over the years.  So if you are a fan of Hollow Earth and good science fiction, Super Atragon is a movie to look out for.",1089676800,5,2009,4.538888888888889
7879940,3,6304969503,"Super Atragon was a fairly good Anime movie, the animation and design was excellent,the idea was great, but the script wasn't all that one would hope, some parts played out as more soap opera than sci-fi, and it contains totally gratuitous and pointless [albiet brief] nudity. On the up side the giant cylinder things with the rotating cogs were cool, as was The Ra submarine, and the hero, Go, was a likeable charachter.
I also just wanted to first explain a few things about Super Atragon brought up by the other reviewers, first, Ann keepsyelling ""Avatar"" because Avatar, her former friend, keeps mentally attacking her. Second the name Super Atragon apparently comes from the 1963? Toho movie Atragon, featuring the Super Submarine named, you guessed it, Atragon.",1011916800,,767,5.047244094488189
7879941,2,6304969503,"I'd Have to Agree with soldiersofoz. The movie never really developed. You sat there watching something you knew the ending to already. And soldiersofoz was right, the one chick seemed to scream ""Avatar"" every time she was in a scene. The Sob stories told in the movie made you wanna cry. Not over their sad lives but for them to shut up. It was a dissapointment and I feel sorry for my brother who bought the movie. Thats my opinion though, you could love it. Doubtful though.",984873600,,477,4.494252873563219
