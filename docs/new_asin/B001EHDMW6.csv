3554014,5,B001EHDMW6,"Jet Boy turned out to be a great movie.  A beleveable story executed with some terrific acting.  This is not a ""gay"" interest movie.  The story would appeal to almost everybody.  The main character is a ten year old prostitute but this just adds seasoning to the story line and is not the main entree.  There were some surprises, twists and turns, near the end of the movie that will make it a keeper for your collection.  Very much recommended.",1240963200,60,445,4.5
3554015,5,B001EHDMW6,"Jet Boy deals with some very sensitive subjects. It does so with skillful honesty and without falling into stereotypes and melodramatic depictions. It is a real-life drama that convinces with its sincere authenticity and the profound quality of the interaction between the two leading characters.

The movie is set in Canada and shot in Vancouver, B.C., Calgary and Linden, Alberta, and the road between. The drama focuses on characters influenced by their cultural milieu and by each other. The movie has a simple story and is still complex in its plot development as well as in the pace of plot revelations. The audience never stops learning about the two main characters, their individual stories and their background, which provides the movie with tremendous quality and causes curiosity that makes the audience dive into the story and stay alert.

The main protagonist is Nathan, played by newcomer Branden Nadon. We are introduced to him as he sells his body on his 14th birthday. These very subtle scenes at the beginning make us aware of how desperate this young boy is. He is a hustler, but still a child. We get a very good impression of his life - a bleak, exploited life without much room for dreams and no way out. Then we are introduced to his family. He has no father and his mother is a drug addict. She dies right at the beginning due to an overdose, which leaves Nathan orphaned and totally isolated.

The second main character is a rough and mysterious man named Boon Palmer (played by Dylan Walsh of Nip Tuck), a man we do not know anything about. Apparently he has a questionable past as some kind of criminal. All we know is that he is up to something and violent if challenged.

Nathan is on the road, running away from the social services that would take him in, heading towards Vancouver, when he encounters Boon in a road pub. He associates with him and manages to make the taciturn man give him a ride to the city. On their way they stop in a motel in a small town, where Boon grew up and where he has to settle something. It becomes clear from the very beginning of their traveling companionship that Nathan sees much more than a temporary ride in Boon, but pins all his hopes on him. He does everything to please the man, makes their breakfast and - as some subtle hints reveal - would not mind sleeping in the same bed with him.

Once in the small town, we find out some interesting bits and pieces about Boon's past, about his imperious father, about his old flame and his life twenty years ago. We still do not know who Boon is today, but we get a clearer idea of his roots and find out that he is indeed a rather likable person, which we could not expect right from the beginning. The growing relationship between Boon and Nathan is characterized by frictions, but still slowly growing in depth. Boon renews a sexual affair with his old flame while Nathan associates with some local lads.

The movie's climax is emotionally stirring and intriguingly played by the two leading characters. Nathan breaks away as Boon neglects his love and his yearning for paternal appreciation. Boon has to finish his job in Vancouver, and there he sees how Nathan offers himself to a client. He follows them and rushes into the hotel room as Nathan is about to be sexually harassed. Boon finally opens up his heart to Nathan and takes the boy into his arms and hugs him and the emotional turmoil makes the boy break down and cry. As they leave the hotel, we find out that Boon is in fact an undercover cop - something we did not know throughout the entire movie. They drive back to the small town, as it seems happily united with Nathan finally having the father and security he was search for.

The movie is profoundly authentic and smashing in its sincere character portrayal of a strange man and a young hustler who help each other out of their bleak lives. These two characters carry complex problems and their interaction makes up the emotional thrill of the whole production. The soundtrack is flawless and the camera work lives up to the decisive moments. The other characters are fairly flat, but this is okay here, as the two protagonists carry the burden and define the pace and the quality of the plot development.

I give Jet Boy a 10 because it handles a very sensitive issue - child prostitution - frankly and without corny stereotypes. It furthermore delivers a fine character portrayal and focuses on a very strong father-son aspect, set in a cultural stratum in which hope and trust are hard to find and even harder to maintain. The two leading actors are just brilliant, and thus Jet Boy is an authentic Canadian movie, a wonderful portrayal of genuine human struggles. A Must See movie.",1238976000,48,4721,4.6119047619047615

3554022,4,B001EHDMW6,"An R-rated but inoffensive story about a 14 year old boy goes looking for a father and on a road trip in Canada finds, then, loses, and finds again a father and a family.  Every character is reprehensible; the boy suffers great hardship and physical pain but this is Canada and Canadians are nice.  The film has no raised voices, no real villains; even the boy's friendly drug dealer is careful to warn him that the drug he is selling him is extra potent.

The cast is excellent.  There are only two recognizable American actors from TV.  All the bit players fit their roles in a naturally realistic way,  The star, however, is the boy, Nathan, played by Brandon Nadon, a 14 year 0ld novice.  He is totally believable as he goes through hell to reach a happy ending.  He is an average kid, small for his age who lies, cheats, steals, and hustles adult men but you can't help but empathize for him.

Whereas the cast makes Jet Boy a film worth watching, the quality of the film technically is continually distracting.  A small budget probably prevented post-editing to correct physical and logical mistakes.  There are scenes where a man stands  arms-length from a car and doesn't notice Nathan erasing a phone number written in the dust on the car door or a single bed in one scene is a double later or ahalf eaten loaf of bread is whole in the next scene.  There are flagrantly written coincidences to get the characters in the same place for critical actions.  And the Jet Boy somehow covers the 1000 miles from Calgary to Vancouver faster then a speeding car - -and walking most of the way,

The perfomance by Brandon Nadon redeems the movie.",1467158400,4,1645,4.5476190476190474

What this movie does far better than others I've seen dealing with youth in positions similar to the Jet Boy is in showing us and making us feel along with the adult the shock of understanding just how distorted is the boy's view of society and his place in it and in painfully demonstrating the desperation of the boy's attempts to be rescused from it.",1446768000,,467,4.7073170731707314

3554035,4,B001EHDMW6,"An amazing little film from Canada that I simply stumbled across quite by accident earlier this year and am pleased that I was able to obtain a copy for my personal library.  While the DVD is not studio quality [my understanding is that this film is duplicated to DVD upon order], when you watch the story unfold on the screen you overlook the obvious flaws in the video and/or audio and simply become lost in the story.  While it may move somewhat confusingly and slowly through the majority of the film, the pay off is worth the wait.  The way I see the film, Boone is a fully grown, adult [Steinbeck] Holden Caulfield who does not realize through most of the movie that he is about to become the 'catcher' and will be saving Nathan from 'going over the cliff'.  Boone has perhaps a glimpse of his 'fate' with Nathan when he admits to his dying father in one scene that he had picked up a stray, but (unlike Caulfield who wants to be able to save others in peril) he resists getting too close to or working too hard at becoming a part Nathan's life, until near the film's conclusion [for reasons, both personal and professional for Boone, that I will not give here].  The title of the film has little it seems to do with what is actually happening in the story [although it may be a regional reference to something of which i am not aware]. One must also pay pretty close attention to what seem the most minute of details for some of the sequences to make much sense at all, but in the end, they all do...but you may have to watch it several times to gather most of the nuances.  The film is much worth a watch, but again, you may want to view it two or three times over to get the full impact of the story and realize the redemption for the main characters to the fullest extent.",1437177600,,1782,4.288690476190476

3554044,3,B001EHDMW6,"Jet Boy is a unique coming of age story, that turns out to be nothing like the description on the back of the box. Many people are going to find it somewhat disturbing, however, unlike similar coming of age stories, Jet Boy does ultimately have a point and it's something most people need to learn. 12 year old Nathan (Branden Nardon) lives in poverty with his mother and all he knows is sex, drugs, and violence, so it's no surprise that at the ripe old age of 12, Nathan is a male prostitute. Things change for him when he meets a man who wants something other than sex. The man wants Nathan to help him with a job, and shows the boy kindness for the first time in his life. Nathan thinks he's fallen in love with this man and makes advances, only to be rejected. From his experiences, Nathan will ultimately come to learn that sex and love are two very different things and that kindness, doesn't always mean what he thought it meant. This film was Branden Nardon's acting debut and what a job he did. Part of me questions how someone with no experience can put on a performance like that, while the other part wants to know what kind of parents allow their kids to do something like this. Nardon doesn't just show off his talent with this performance, but he also shows a fearlessness that could come from upbringing or immaturity. Jet Boy is thankfully no where near as graphic as a film as Mysterious Skin, but it still has a few scenes that aren't easy to watch. This film is strange and someone disturbing, but by comparison it does have a message, that similar films don't. The writer is telling audiences to be weary of people who are overly kind, but in the end it doesn't mean that they're looking for something. In it's own bizarre way, it's also saying that sex is sex, and sometimes it's about anything other than love. An impossible lesson to have to learn at such a young age, but that is the true meaning of the film. Nathan learns something at a very young age, that we should have all learned in our adolescents and he ultimately becomes a better person for it. Jet Boy isn't an easy film to watch and many people are going to be turned off by the sheer age of the actor involved, but I like how everything turned out in the end. I was also introduced to a terrific young talent, and I appreciated the fact that the film got it's message across without being overly explicit. Sometimes we need to leave our comfort zones to experience something different and get a message that we general don't think a whole lot about, and for that I do recommend this film.",1411171200,3,2578,4.395397489539749
3554045,4,B001EHDMW6,"Jet Boy was obviously not an expensive production, but it is a compelling look into the life of a young teen who is just beginning to prostitute himself.  From my perspective, he has a warped view of life, but maybe people who grew up with a drug-addicted parent can relate to it.  What direction will the boy's life take?  That question is answered by the end of the DVD.  I suppose it was filmed for broadcast on Canadian TV.  There is no nudity in the movie.

Except for a point or two, the storyline of the picture is well thought out.  I felt the way the road trip began was a little sketchy, and possibly some extra dialog would have made the aftermath of the gunshot sequence more believable.  The acting is reasonably good though not outstanding.

Amazon sells this fairly expensive movie only in the DVD-R format.  As such, you only get the movie on the disk, with none of the 'extras' such as menu or chapter selections.  The quality was very good, though not outstanding, on my medium sized, flat screen TV.

I've watched this movie a couple of times, and the second time, I picked up on several point I missed in the first viewing.

Read the synopsis on Amazon, and if the subject matter interests you, I can recommend this movie.",1409529600,2,1242,4.466666666666667

3554047,5,B001EHDMW6,"This is a story of bonding between a boy called Nathan (Branden Nadon) who has nothing and no one and a stranger Boone (Dylan Walsh) who happens to be an undercover cop. Nathan has had a rough life.  In the opening scene you find him in the bed of someone who likes to beat his sex partners with a belt and you see the welts on Nathan's back and this is on his birthday.  When he goes home he finds a strange girl in his bed.  His mother asks him for the drugs and that his birthday cake is in the fridge.  What he finds is the remains of a cake.  This is how he celebrates his birthday. He makes a wish and thinks it comes true when his mother overdoses on the drugs and dies  On the TV he sees the ""perfect"" family but he knows better. At the police station he is asked how he feels and he asks what would his mother feel if it were him instead. When one of the detectives says that he has two boys of his own and if that happened to one of them he would feel devastated, Nathan says - and this is the reality of his life - ""Did you ever sell them? Didn't think so.""  Nathan runs when they want to turn him over to child services.  On the road he runs into Boone who is headed in the same direction and their bonding begins.  The road is a long one and when Boone says he won't leave him, Nathan again with a telling statement that ""promises from a grown-up doesn't mean very much""  Things happen along the drive and the detour they take that causes Nathan to leave Boone and go on his own.  They both arrive at Vancouver separately and Boone realizes that they need each other and by chance sees him get into a car of a john and finds and saves him. Now Nathan has some one.  The acting if great. Hopefully Brandon Nadon will have a great career in film.  I would give it a six if it were available.",1407715200,6,1802,4.014005602240896

3554050,5,B001EHDMW6,"WARNING:  This movie may steal your heart.

This is a very uplifting, heartfelt movie with superb writing/directing and AMAZING acting.  It is a growing cult classic for a reason and is not to be missed.  It handles sensitive subject matter (underage prostitution) very tastefully and respectfully, and doesn't take cheap shots (it doesn't capture your heart only to destroy it with tragedy - you can trust where it's taking you).

This reminds me of a John Hughes-type coming-of-age movie like Sixteen Candles or Uncle Buck, but with decidedly alternative content.  It's a great movie to watch and discuss with queer/LGBT teens, as they will relate to the feelings of being outcast and alone, and will cheer as this kid sets himself free and finds people who love him for who he is.

If you open your heart to the characters, which is easy to do, this movie will take you for an emotionally uplifting ride.  It's a movie that is not quickly forgotten - it touches the soul.  Although it contains a few disturbing scenes to set the context of this kid's past, they are not overwhelming or graphic, and they contribute to the story positively.  It's not shocking or sensational.

The starring role is played by a 14 year-old new actor, Branden Nadon, who plays a 14 year-old (rather than a 35 year-old pretending to be a teen, which imo ruins many movies).  This gives the movie realism and depth, and Branden simply does an amazing job with his facial expressions and emotional acting - what a brave young actor to take this part and do it so well!  He alone could carry this movie, but he has great supporting actors as well as a very smart script.

It's worth buying the DVD because like all classics this movie has playability.  Also, you'll help support the people who made the film (not Hollywood), and help them to have funds to release a Bluray version.

If you like this movie, be sure to check out the interview with director David Schultz on TheSkyKid website (just search google for ""david schultz jet boy interview""), which gives some great background on the making of this film, and some anecdotes about how it has steadily grown in popularity since it was released in 2001.

As the director said, this movie could not be made today due to self-censorship in the industry.  Don't miss this film - it's a gem that deserves a larger audience.",1404432000,2,2353,4.683698296836983
3554051,5,B001EHDMW6,"I first came across this Canadian-made TV film around a year ago.  It's an eye opener to the shocking world of child prostitution. No sign of dad, and mum wrecked through drug addiction.  A 12 year old boy has to find money to pay bills but his pimp, not so much older, considers only his own needs for the cash. An under cover cop provides something of a sub-plot with his own failed marriage, but protecting the boy becomes a priority. It is gripping, and I see more in it with every viewing.  A brave film for producers to take on and especially for a child actor to portray.  The mood of the film is very dark and sits well in the dark cinematography, reflecting those scenes.

3554074,5,B001EHDMW6,"I have reviewed this film on IMDB, but it is so good, I want to add a review here.  As others have stated, Branden Nadon gives a spectacular performance
as a 14 year old (and he looks 14) involved in child prostitution for pedophiles, with a drug addicted mother, while trying to live a normal life in school.
But when his mother dies early on of a heroin overdose, he runs away from authorities rather than risk a foster placement.  Dylan Walsh notices him at the
police station where he appears to be involved in some drug deal, and it appears he has some shady involvements.  Later, the boy meets up by accident with
Walsh at a diner, and a slow uneasy relationship develops between them that is the central theme of the film.  While ""Nathan"" claims he has a father in
Vancouver and wants a ride there, he really is looking for a father figure.  From that point the movie has many excellent moments and scenes, and leads
to a very emotional and satisfying climax.  I especially enjoyed the scenes in ""Boon's"" home town, where he meets an old flame, and her son and Nathan
become friends.  The relationship between the two teens is very believable, as are the other two boys, one gay, who they meet up with.  Also Boon's relationship
with his once girlfriend shows us a soft side to him.  Rather than give more of the plot, I will say what I think is the one thing that makes the film
hard to believe.  That is that Nathan, despite his horrific past and circumstances, is such a good kid, and wants to be.  When he says to the girlfriends
son's friend, ""I just want to be a good kid"", it is a highlight of the film.  I just find it hard to believe that any kid who has lived as he has would have the
wherewithall to not have succumbed more to the environment he was growing up in.  Branden Nadon reminds me of the kind of 8th graders I grew up with, in
my nice upper middle class neighborhood in the 50's.  However, if Nathan were like I would have expected, the movie would not be the great story it was.
Perhaps more realistic, but ultimately angry and depressing.  So since I like to see films that leave me feeling good rather than depressed, I am glad
to give this film a top rating, as I did on IMDB too.  It is one of my 10 favorites (out of 500 owned and nearly 3000 seen) and definitely the best cable
TV film I have ever seen.",1353715200,,2338,4.267573696145124

One can never cease to be amazed at the resourcefullness of kids in this situation, just surviving each day must be a battle of wits and ingenuity.

3554079,5,B001EHDMW6,"If you care about kids struggling in their relationships with adults--both loving and abusive--then this is the film for you. It's both heart breaking and heart warming. It will surprise you right to the end and make you laugh and cry throughout. Writer/Director David Schultz keeps the plot moving. There are no soggy scenes.

At the center is Branden Nadon's Nathan, a thirteen year old hustler in some never identified Canadian city.
Nathan is really looking for his dad. Well, a dad. The attractive young Nadon is brilliant as Nathan the Jet Boy. He manages to project innocence and street savvy and physical appeal all at the same time. He's fun to watch and his lines of dialogue are sharp.

See this movie even if you're queasy about the supposed subject matter, a thirteen year old boy selling his body to survive tough city streets. I say supposed because the sex, the prostitution, is in the shadows, never seen, revealed in dialogue only. Anyway it's not the point of the film at all; relationships are. If nothing else, see the movie for the kid. Branden Nadon is such an appealing presence, you will quickly fall in love with his Nathan.

Much of the story unfolds when Nathan cleverly hooks up with Boone, a thirty something guy in a hot car on a hot and mysterious mission. The actor playing Boone turns in a great performance. The relationship between Boone and Nathan is totally believable as Nathan tries to bond with Boone and Boone resists, often angrily.

I agree with another reviewer: it's strange such a sweet and well-made movie hasn't had more exposure. Partly for that reason, it took me several years (really) of mulling before I bought this DVD. Now I consider it money well spent. You will, too.",1347062400,,1725,4.74

3554081,4,B001EHDMW6,"The gay theme is only secondary in this film. A rather young boy, probably ten or eleven, the son of a drug addicted mother who dies one day on him with an overdose she gets from the heroin he has brought her and he had bought with the money he had made with an older man he had serviced intimately.

He escapes social services and manages to find himself in the hands, some sort of two way blackmailing or dependence, of a man he decides is going to be his father. He manages to get in his car and the man starts taking him to Vancouver.

On the way to there the man goes back to his hometown where he visits his invalid and unconscious father but that leads him to a girl friend from a long time ago and the boy he is transporting, Nathan, falls for the son of the woman. The man, Boon, falls again or anew for the woman, but he is on a big case, though we do not know exactly what, criminal probably.

Nathan comes to a desperate proposal to keep Boon, a desperate intimate proposal that Boon refuses and that refusal sets Nathan on the run again.

The action ends up in Vancouver for sure where Nathan is more or less in the room of an older man and needs to be reprieved from perdition while Boon is following and arriving and breaking a door, and at the same time he is getting tailed by an important criminal of some kind he is dealing with.

The end is sentimental in a way but everything gets clear though most of the important scenes happen in the night with little light and kind of all blurred up in and by darkness.

The question of the film is simple. Does a boy need a father? What kind of substitute activities can a boy without a father do to feel close to an older man? The answer is as simple as the question. Yes a boy needs a father or a father substitute and a boy without such a father model next to him will do all kinds of risky and dumb things to feel older than he is and to fill the emptiness he experiences in his heart somewhere between his brain and his diaphragm.

Maybe it could be better not to show that film to children under the tender age of ten or something like that. And be ready to answer a few questions if your son is too young and direct enough to ask embarrassing queries.

The storyline is at times very tragic and sad, but also contains many emotionally moving moments as well. It is a story of a poor fatherless boy named Nathan and how he must sell himself in order to support himself and his drug-addicted mother. Branden Nadon's facial expressions really portray the feelings of sadness and at times, emotional detachment from his character. It was truly a powerful performance by a young actor in his film debut. After yet another tragedy in his life, he takes to the road and meets up with a stranger. This stranger is in some ways a similar personality to him and Nathan is surprised when this person does not want to use him like so many adults had in his life. Dylan Walsh is brilliant as the detached stranger. Their journey together hits a few other snags as well. An excellent movie, at times sad, at times touching. Surprised this movie did not receive wider distribution when it was made.

3554088,5,B001EHDMW6,"*Mild Spoiler Alert (But hey, the others have some spoilers too)

I purchased this movie (being my first DVD in about 5 years- with streaming no need) from Amazon after seeing it recommended to me by them.  After looking through various reviews, I figured I would like this.

This movie is about an 8th grade boy, in Canada, who is lost, confused, depressed, and in a world of hurt.  This movie is not for the faint hearted.  If you have trepidations and concerns of watching movies regarding young teens involved in sex, prostitution, running away, drug abuse ([sex] not directly shown, but well known through the movie), don't get it.

If you have ever worked with a kid who is struggling in this way, you will notice how well portrayed this movie is.  It does have some very hard concepts and problems that this boy faces- but, so does the world today.  Even if you have not worked with any kids with these problems, it is still a great look into these problems. Another great aspect of this movie, is it takes place in Canada.  These problems are endemic worldwide and are not limited to American boarders.

Dylan Walsh is amazing in this role too.  Im not going to spoil the details, but this movie demonstrates how wierd it looks to take in a kid who is struggling, but looks can be deceiving.  Walsh shows what all good people are capable of.

Some peoples reviews ask if Nathan is really gay or not.  I am extremely happy you are left with that thought.  He is a 13-14 year old kid.  He shouldn't know, nor worry himself with that.  He actually makes a statement in the movie to an older boy saying he just wants to be a kid.  Kids need not worry themselves with these issues.  He struggles to find a male role model, finds one, thinks keeping this role model requires sex, and so on.

Many of us forget that there are kids out there that fend for themselves and do not know where to go for help, never-the-less ask for it.  Having been a counselor for boys in this age group, I have seen, first hand, these issues.",1320796800,,2023,4.4135135135135135
3554089,5,B001EHDMW6,Jet Boy is a Canadian film set in the larger area around Vancouver and involves the search by a young abused teenage boy for security and affection.  There are a number of well defined themes in the story all of which are intelligently and carefully constructed.  As the various themes develop a well judged sense of uncertainty emerges as the main characters meet and contribute to the power of the film's central purpose.  Important to the story's evolution is a carefully written homosexual theme which approaches the subject from a number of standpoints.  This thread of the film is handled with care and serves as both a decoy as to film's conclusion and as a statement about youthful homosexuality itself.  The acting of the young Branden Nadon is perfectly in tune with this important part of the film's intent. The conclusion of the film will be exactly the surprise that the writer intended.,1319760000,,900,4.856209150326797
3554090,5,B001EHDMW6,"*** Some BIG spoilers about plot development follow, so be warned ***

I caught this movie a few days ago and I've been thinking about it ever since, which is why I've just ordered it here. Glad to see a version of this movie has made it to DVD. It is hard to explain exactly what makes this such a great film to me, but writing as someone with a few father/son issues of my own, this movie has unexpectedly and profoundly affected me.

The performances from the leads are great, especially from Branden Nadon and Dylan Walsh, and the story moves along well. Young Branden is just excellent here - he breathes real life into his character - making him both toughened and vulnerable at the same time. Where is he? We need to see more of him as an adult actor.

The script may become a little unrealistic at the end to push us towards our happy ending, but I can forgive it that because it's the ending I was hoping for. Some of the other characters are only sketched, but they are all carefully positioned to support the two performances at the heart of this story.

I challenge any audience to remain unmoved by the final scenes between Boon and Nathan. How could anyone want anything else for these characters? Love and redemption win for them both, and they find it in each other. I can honestly say that nothing on film has moved me more than this for a long time.

If you're used to a diet of slick, multiplex fodder then some of the production values may disappoint you occasionally, but none of that gets in the way of the telling of this neatly crafted little story.

Dave Schultz is to be congratulated for creating a very moving independent Canadian film on what I imagine was a limited budget. He successfully navigates a taboo subject to create a little gem of storytelling about fathers and sons.

And the track over the closing titles ""Whisper in Time"" by Bad Religion is killer! Very appropriate.

Recommended.

It really is very surprising and heart wrenching - and heart warming stuff. And again I also ask - why have I not heard of this? Why did Brandon Nadon not become a household name?  His is a superb actor. I have just one question .. why is it called Jet Boy? Did I miss something ?",1311811200,3,584,4.252252252252252
3554093,5,B001EHDMW6,"I just happened to find this small Canadian film accidentally and I'm glad I did. I really love it.  It is a great story of a recently orphaned desperate young street hustler named Nathan, whose mother just died from a drug overdose, who runs away from the authorities. He meets a loner named Boon Palmer that Nathan immediately looks up to as a father figure. But Boon is a reluctant father figure as he never had a good relationship with his own father, and struggles with the turmoil of his feelings of caring about this child, but at the same time not being really sure he can help him and the fear of becoming too involved with someone other than himself.

The story is solid and the pacing of the movie is good. It's not the perfectly put together picture that you would come to expect from an American production. It does suffer a little from the small budget production values and the inexperience of the director/writer and production crew. The film often has more of a TV Movie feel than a feature film. Some of the dialogue and situations are slightly clich and in some spots the dialogue is rather sparse and occasionally I found myself wishing for more interaction between the characters. I also think the film could have explored the gritty dark side of the life of a hustler with a bad childhood a bit more. For as much as the Nathan character has been through and seen, he is a little too innocent and resilient for someone who could come from that environment.

However many key scenes really work excellent and are very well written and executed. There are a few plot turns, especially at the end of the movie, which seem to stretch believability and rely on extreme coincidence. However, not so much so where the movie comes off as very contrived and they were probably done as a plot convention to move the story to a close in a suspenseful and expedient way. And there is a surprise ending that I really liked and thought was a nice touch. But despite the movie's flaws, the actors bring these characters to life and I was emotionally invested in this story from the opening scene until the end credits rolled down the screen.

Where this movie shines is in the relationship between the two main characters of Nathan, played by Branden Nadon, and Boon, played by Dylan Walsh. There is a real chemistry between these two that makes the whole movie believable. Without brilliant casting, this movie could have been mediocre at best, and completely forgettable. I especially think that Nadon did an excellent job, considering this was his first role. He plays the character of a 14 year old street hustler perfectly.  He acts the role subtly, not overacting as many child actors would do, being both tough at times and vulnerable. It is a very naturalistic performance, as he delivers his lines realistically as a young man would. He expresses a lot of his emotion in his face and body language. It's a shame he really hasn't done much after this movie. Of course Walsh is great as well, as are the supporting players, including Kelly Rowan as Boon's former flame and Jordan Weller as Rowan's son.

I'm not really sure why this film is not better known, as it is superior to many big Hollywood productions. I know that many Canadian films struggle with getting distribution outside of the domestic Canadian market, especially in the US. Maybe it's because it is a movie focused mainly on the characters and their slow development as they reveal more about themselves. It does deal with child prostitution which is a controversial topic; however that is a small part of the story that is only to show the desperation of Nathan's situation. It is not exploitative at all as some films of this genre are. But it does bring light to an issue which does exist. It's not like many independent films that have a deep convoluted message, or try to push the envelope of film making. It is a simple film and tells a straight forward story. But those are the very things I like about Jet Boy the most.  This film has a lot of heart with a message of hope.

I can't recommend this movie enough. I don't usually buy films since I have Netflix. But this film is only available at Amazon. I also don't usually write reviews, but I've gone on and on here. Considering it is a hidden gem it is well worth the money. It is the type of movie you can watch multiple times.

3554095,5,B001EHDMW6,"Cheated!  Brandon Nadon (Nathan) has been cheated in credit concerning his superior acting role in ""Jet Boy"", a low budget, yet masterfully written masterpiece.

Nathan is an eight grade aged child who is soled out/pimped by his Mother to earn money to pay bills and support her drug dependency.  The character of his mother is released from script duties early in the movie.  Nathan is a loving child, wanting to live an honest life.  He has never been shown how in example nor love.  He is in search of an honest life and a Father to seal his life's cover.

Dylan Walsh (Boone) is superior in his role as Nathan's dream of a Father.  Boone is a man pondering his disregarded role of a son and how he is viewed in the mind of his unconscious Father.  He does not understand how a boy could view him as a man to be drawn to Father figure.

Kelly Rowan beholds a minor role in this masterpiece.  I feel she is given credit above Brandon Nadon (Nathan).  She plays the role of a 'want to-be' Mother figure for Nathan and a sex partner for Boone.

Kelly Rowan, in all character listings I have seen for this movie, is listed prior to Brandon Nadon.  I mean no disrespect to her acting ability.  Her role, compared to those of Dylan Walsh and Brandon Nadon need not have been mentioned other than in the in small print scrolled at the end of the movie.

3554096,5,B001EHDMW6,"Judging from the previous reviews before mine, I bought this film and didn't regret doing so at all. The cast was excellent for the most and thank God there are still some men out there who are soft on the inside(Dylan Walsh's xter). The boy on the other hand didn't talk much but if and when he did, there were mostly short but detailed answers and question. Highly recommended",1297468800,4,378,4.492753623188406
3554097,5,B001EHDMW6,Deleted scenes and directors commentary provide even more insight into the making of this film.  The big question is why has Branden Nadon not had more screen opportunities?  I think even this film's  director wonders the same thing.,1296777600,3,233,5.078947368421052
3554098,5,B001EHDMW6,"Think the world is a perfect place? It isn't! This movie shows what some people will do to their kids and how the choices ripple. I thought it was a excellent movie with great acting from both Dylan Walsh and Branden Nadon who plays Nathan (God's gift). This movie will stay with you for a while and at least for me it wasn't one of those movie's I am going to sell back on the amazon.com marketplace. The ending definitely did the movie justice and leaves your heart warm. Boy's need fathers bottom line and they will go to any lengths to get them. A+ coming of age film. Also other than one of the main characters (Nathan) who is forced to sleep with men to support his mothers drug habit there are no boylove (gross) or heavy gay overtures, unless you get this movie and fantasize about buying a 8th grade boy for sex. This is about finding a true fathers love.",1295395200,4,864,4.306748466257669
3554099,5,B001EHDMW6,"A very emotional movie about a boy and his life. His adventure is nothing normal and you will want to watch the whole thing. Prepare to laugh, cry, and possibly get angry at a character or two.",1294012800,4,193,4.243243243243243
3554100,3,B001EHDMW6,The movie does not have closed-captioned for hearing impaired people. The movie plot is difficult to understand and have to guess what the actors are saying in the movie plot of Jet Boy. The movie is okay but hard for hearing impaired people to know what is happening in the movie story.,1291593600,2,287,4.538461538461538
3554101,4,B001EHDMW6,"Jet Boy was an endearing look at the bonds between Fathers and Sons in a rather unique story revolving around a very young hustler named Nathan and Boon an older man who is sort of mysterious.
Dylan Walsh plays Boon a wonderful character who pretends to be hard nosed and hard edged but has a heart of gold. He meets up with Nathan after Nathan's mom overdoses and Nathan flees.
The chemistry between the two characters is amazing and makes the film all the more effective.
It can make you cry and make you laugh.""Branden Nadon"" who portrays Nathan is a pretty good little actor and draws you in so it's easy to feel his pain and plight.
There is some sexual content that some might deem inappropriate because Nathan is so young,about 13..No explicit sex is shown but you know what is going on ,what I liked about it is even though the main storyline revolves around this subject it isn't objectified or gratuitous in the least. It is done very tastefully and in a matter of fact way. I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it to be a very satisfying film and it left me feeling good.",1289174400,4,1079,4.42713567839196
3554102,4,B001EHDMW6,"A movie about sex, prostitution, drugs, and incest. A bit more gay scenes and a little less happiness, defiantly at the end. kind of ruined it.",1284249600,,143,4.538461538461538
3554103,5,B001EHDMW6,"This Canadian-made movie is a gem that deserves wider recognition. The acting is excellent throughout. Although it's a low-budget film, the production values are high. I don't know why anyone would say that the storyline is unclear. It is both a mystery and a very compelling, human story.

After his drug-addicted mother dies from an overdose on Nathan's 14th birthday, he is on his own. Although he sometimes sells his body in order to survive, the movie is not about child prostitution, and there are no obscene or titillating moments at all.

Here is IMDB's one-sentence plot summary: ""A mysterious stranger finds an unlikely traveling companion in an orphan boy trying to dodge the authorities."" The stranger is Boon Palmer, played compellingly by Dylan Walsh; the boy is Nathan, played brilliantly by Branden Nadon.

Against all odds Nathan bravely persists in his search. All he wants is to be a good kid with a real dad. Unfortunately, Boon, who appears to be up to no good, is an unlikely and unwilling candidate. The mystery of who Boon is and what will happen to Nathan will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The film first breaks your heart and then gives you a realistic happy ending. (I hate fake happy endings.) Superbly done.

Subscribers to Netflix should call Netflix customer service and ask them to add this movie to their catalog. Fortunately, the DVD is available here.",1279324800,3,1393,4.836134453781512
3554104,5,B001EHDMW6,This movie does a really great job at keeping the interest of the viewers. The story line is not really clear it is just following a boy that is trying to find a family. There is some swearing in the movie. The actors do well in the movie. I think it is well worth seeing.,1273708800,2,272,3.963636363636364
3554105,2,B001EHDMW6,"I was sold on buying this film based on all the rave reviews, however, this movie and my opinion of it is much differnt.  We're sold on the idea that a young boy is (somehow)thrust into prostitution. How he got involved and why he sells himself is never addressed. Yes, his mom is a drug addict (who o.d's in her first scene and dies)which is MAYBE why the boy tricks to feed her habit?  Now, without a mother or father the boy is forced to live on his own(?). He walks around with a upside down smiley tee shirt on (through out the whole movie)taking up with and riding in a car with an older guy he meets in a resturant.  I guess the two of them just ""click"", but again, there's no believable character developement between the two. In fact, the boy just walks up to the table in the resturant where the guy is eating a hamburger and sits down, striking up a conversation. The older guy doesn't offer to buy him food and is also perplexed about who this kid is and what he wants. The guy the boy takes up with has a soap opera relationship with an old fling who doesn't question why her ex is running around with a 13 year old boy.  Later in the movie, when the boy decides to sell himself again he ends up getting picked up by a naive guy ""who's doing it for the first time.""  The boy says, ""Well, it's not my first time- and I won't go all the way."" In next scene the naive man has his belt off and wants to beat the boy (who locks himself in the bathroom). It was so cliche that it was hard to believe (and I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt). Of course, the boy's older buddy rushes into the motel roomat the last minute, busts down the door and, well, we have our happy ending.  It came off like an after school special. I make no apologies for this review.  On the positive side, it's an ok movie if you just want to relax and be entertained.",1271721600,15,1859,4.09065934065934
3554106,4,B001EHDMW6,I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. It surpassed my expectations. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a movie so much.,1271635200,4,128,4.608695652173913
3554107,5,B001EHDMW6,"Quite nice cinematography. Mysterious dark subtext turns out light. Child slowly rises up from abandonment and despair, prostitution and drugs, into connection and love, family love, through the force of his own iron will. Mystery resolved and happy endings all around.",1270944000,3,269,5.585365853658536
3554108,4,B001EHDMW6,"This is a remarkably good film about an unusual subject. If I said that it is the story of a very young rent boy, you might easily be put off. Happily, it is much more than that. It is about bravery and persistence against the odds. It is also a feel-good mystery story in which nothing is what it seems. The boy is superbly well played by Dylan Walsh, a remarkable young actor who holds your attention all the time he is on the screen. One mystery is, is the boy naturally homosexual, or simply 'gay-for-pay'? It is a sobering and often uncomfortable story about what some people have to do in order to survive. Full marks to the Canadians for this first class film.

However, I would love to know in what way the directors cut differs from the original which I already have. Are there any significant differences, or is this just another marketing 'come on'?",1270944000,4,860,4.443037974683544
3554109,5,B001EHDMW6,I have watched this movie several times and I think it is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. Young Nathan is out in the world selling his body to survive and getting beat in the process. He runs away after his mom dies from an overdose and meets Boone who is on a mission but we are left to try and figure out what or who Boone really is. It is an interesting movie that doesn't leave us wanting and my favorite scene is when Boone rescues Nathan from the perverts bathroom at the end of the movie and Nathans words to Boone will leave you in tears. Just an all around great movie and if you aren't moved by it then there is something wrong.,1265587200,7,653,3.9923664122137406
3554110,4,B001EHDMW6,"While the topic might be disturbing to some it is reality. There are drugs and there is child prostitution and people do search for ""trust"" in others ... sometimes in the most unlikely places. This endearing movie has all of those things and more.
The movie captures the imagination form the first scene and you won't lose interest as this road movie progresses across america.
Well worth having as part of your collection.",1264809600,5,423,4.808219178082192
3554111,5,B001EHDMW6,"once again a great delivery of there product.. well packed, a plesure to receive.. thank you Amazon.
I found Jet boy a very down to earth movie.. well acted, i was very sad for that young boy at first, but as the story went on i was pleased to see that it would have a very happy ending,it shows how vile some men are who pick up young boys, and hurt them,i feel like i wanted to jump in and save that poor boy, thank goodness he was saved and i had a good cry..its a must be read story, very enjoyable..",1261526400,9,504,3.950980392156863
3554112,5,B001EHDMW6,"I got this movie on a lark not really knowing what it was really about because I am an avid movie collector and thought this would make an interesting addition to the collection.  I really wasn't expecting the gut wrenching, very frank, subject matter about child prostitution and the devastating effects that it and a terrible home life with an uncaring druggie parent has on a child as portrayed in this film.  I am very glad I got this movie!  I truly believe that you should see it if you have a chance but be forewarned that some parts may be hard to watch. Nothing graphic or obscene is in this movie and if your interests are not so pure then this movie is definitely not for you.

I don't want to be a spoiler so I won't go over more of the subject matter of this film, especially since there is a synopsis and other reviews that contain spoilers, but will say that the delicate subject matter this film covers is handled in a thoughtful and thought provoking manner.  The story is not solely about child prostitution but, rather, deals with the emotional subject of a boy's real need for a male role model and the importance of father / son relations.

Even though this is a low budget production that, appears, was originally made for Canadian television, Brandon Nadon, the child actor in this movie gives an outstanding performance along with Dylan Walsh, the rough character that ""Nathan"" bonds with.  It also does have good production value and does not really seem low budget.  I have never seen a movie dealing with subject matter like this handled with so much grace, sensitivity, and thoughtfulness.  At times some situations may seem a bit hard to believe but this really is a great underrated movie that truly deserves much more attention.

You won't be disappointed with this selection.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  (My actual rating would be 4 1/2 stars)",1250899200,17,1886,4.647590361445783
3554113,4,B001EHDMW6,Not knowing anything about this movie but was highly recommended by a friend i bought it and when i watched it i really loved it.

3554114,5,B001EHDMW6,"I am from outside the US but bought this movie here - could not find it elsewhere. I don't understand why this film is hardly known. Of course, it is a low-budget production (but that does not affect its quality), of course, its theme might be critical and not mainstream. But neither is it about a gay, nor is it a movie just for pedophiles (though Nathan is a very likeable boy...).

It is about a poor boy (Nathan) who lost his parents and has to take care for himself. Nobody does really love him, so he is searching for true love (that is why he sells his body) - but they that ""buy"" him just do use him; it is not to love. On the road Nathan finds a man called Boone (great-acting Dylan Walsh) who takes him along, but isn't willing to care for that child in the long run. So one day he sends the boy away - who is then starting his old business again...

The story is so honest, so near to the poor life of those children who live on the streets - very emotional. The movie belongs to the best ones I've ever seen, and is worth the price (though there are no additional features on the DVD). 5***** for the producers and actors - esp. young Branden Nadon is great!",1246924800,170,1171,4.131578947368421
3554115,5,B001EHDMW6,"This was an awesome movie! A positive uplifting story about a abandoned adolescent boy looking for a father who meets a man trying to forget the pain of his relationship with his own father. Nathan is a sexually confused boy desperately looking for security of a father figure. He runs into Boone, a hardened loner whom Nathan latches onto. We learn that Boone has some emotional father issues of his own, and Nathan shows up to provide him a way to work them out. In other words, Boone finds that he can resolve his own sadness at his father's lack of love by giving Nathan the love and security he needs. This is a low budget made-for-tv movie, but the unusual story line---and the heart rendering performance by Branden Nadon as Nathan---make this a must-see movie for anyone who has familiar with the sort of emotional wounds that too often occur between father and son. It brought tears to my eyes...and a good feeling at the happy ending. I agree--must see.

BTW, this is NOT a movie about boylove or child prostitution, this is really about the painful relationships between fathers and sons. The need for men to mentor their sons, and the need of an adolecent boy for a strong male role model. Nathan's involvement in sexual abuse is only important in the development of his character as a lost boy. It adds to the drama that Boone's interest in him was entirely non-sexual. Unfortunately, inclusion of these issues might have doomed this astounding movie to oblivion. That is really sad.

Struck by Brandon Nadon's performance, I immediately looked for more pictures by thim only to learn that Branden Nadon subsequent career was making some sleazy horror movies. So I guess he got typecast a little. Sad, he was a tremendous actor that deserved some better roles. See more of Nadon in a bit part in Living with the Dead, Taken and Masters of Horror. Hopefully we will see in some more challenging adult roles in the future.",1246060800,114,1933,4.699115044247788
