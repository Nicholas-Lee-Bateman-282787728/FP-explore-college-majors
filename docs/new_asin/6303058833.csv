543273,5,6303058833,"Loved this DVD.  Actually loved it more for one of the extras than the main story.  The Aztecs episodes were OK, but we are more used to the Dr. fighting an evil enemy whereas in this story the Doctor and friends simply stumble out of a temple and their adversary is simply a temple priest who correctly recognizes them as not being gods.  OK, the priest is the one in charge of human sacrifices, but still, the Doctor needs a more challenging adversary in my opinion.
The extra is a full length reconstruction of a lost serial, Galaxy 4.  All the original dialogue exists.  Where the original film is lost, the audio is played in conjunction still photos from the episode, something I find much more effective than the animated episode that fill in some of the reconstructed serials. The story involves the Doctor landing on a planet about to explode.  Two damaged spacecraft are on the planet.  One of the spacecraft is crewed by beautiful women and one is crewed by bug eyed monsters.  The bug eyed monsters are nice guys just trying to help out whereas the women are the bad guys.  Amusing serial. Dorky name.  Doubt that the writers had an idea what a galaxy is.",1463961600,2,1167,4.54066985645933

543278,5,6303058833,"This is one of the best William Hartnell stories and in my book, ranks in the top 10 of all time classic series episodes.

If there is one thing the BBC can really do, it's historical drama and it is done well in The Aztecs. Most performances are very well performed with the exception of John Ringham (Tlotoxl) who seemed to be doing a Shakespearean Richard III variation where I was seriously expecting to hear the famous ""Now is the winter of our discontent..."" speech at one point and even that didn't really damage the overall story line.

543373,5,6303058833,"One of the very earliest Doctor Who stories, ""The Aztecs"" may not be something that modern audiences will go nuts over. The plot is less about action and more about suspense, with the TARDIS crew having to navigate through the politics of the upper levels of Aztec civilization while trying to find a way out of danger. Still, this is a classic, with well-made and researched sets, some good writing and some decent (though at times hammy) acting from the main cast and the supporting characters.

Please note, however, that this is the Special Edition version; the original version released to DVD does have the story and a few bonus features, but this is more elaborate, including a couple documentaries on the fall of the Aztec Empire as well as a reconstruction of the incomplete serial ""Galaxy 4"", itself missing save for some snippets of footage and its third (of four) parts.

than twice as much for not much more special features but you feel like you have no choice
because you don't want to pay the astronomical price third parties are selling for classic Doctor Who DVD's
because they are supposedly going out of print...
Well, do some research. That's what the internet is for and if you're so lazy you can't type away to
find a better price then you deserve to pay $50-100.00 per DVD!
But look no further, while supplies last the WBShop.com has The Aztecs for only $9.46 of course
the last time I did this was when they had Time-Flight, Planet of the Spiders, The Gunfighters and Frontios for great prices
and although I immediately ordered the first three for myself right away I did miss out on Frontios because my review here
must have worked and people flocked to the WBStore... now Frontios is gone, darn it!!!!

543455,1,6303058833,"Hi all,
Well I suppose if you can't get the single 2003 version of The Aztecs then the currently more affordable Special Edition is a must own, but personally I went for the single disc version. And I was able to get it for a mere $9.99 so it was more than worth it to me.
I'm not really interested in Galaxy 4 because even though I admit I am usually a completest not every single Doctor Who episode interests me. For me An Unearthly Child, The Daleks, The Aztecs, The Keys of Marinus, Planet of the Giants, Dalek Invasion of Earth, The Romans, The Space Museum and The War Machines are pretty much the best of the Hartnell era stories that have survived so unless they have added animation the same as they did for the 2nd Doctor's - The Invasion then I'm not interested.
Even The Rescue whole and complete to me was a bonus, same with The Chase. I also picked up The Gunfighters because I was able to get it for only $16.99 as opposed to the big smack down price some of the first 2 Doctors are going for now due to many of the classic series DVD's going out of print. So getting the single disc Aztecs for me not only completed my list of fav Hartnell era stories but I was able to get it at a great price at half of what the Special Edition is going for...
The ONLY thing that I liked the Special Edition more for is the cover is quite a bit better but that doesn't justify paying twice as much when you are trying to collect as many classic Doctor Who DVD's in as short a time as possible while they are systematically going out of print.
If you do a Google search online by typing in the title of the DVD you are looking for and the word 'BUY' in the same sentence and you keep looking (it may take some keystroke effort!)but you may find a few sites like I have that still have some of the odd out of print DW DVD's for more than fair prices. I've also found a few sites that have a good deal of North American Doctor Who DVD's for very good prices... just takes a bit of research.
It's literally a race. Which DW DVD will suddenly be $100.00 today is the question? So it's better to get a mix, both of your favorite stories and the cheapest you can find ANY of the classic series before they all like the TARDIS... disappear....",1393459200,,2237,4.144827586206897

I didn't want to be an uneducated Doctor Who fan so I bought this DVD at a local store and watched it. The episode, while not as exciting or advanced as it's later episodes, has a certain charm to it.

543460,4,6303058833,"Keep in mind that this show was designed as an adventure show for children.  Even so, this one has quite a bit of over-acting and a few fights.  Several of the characters even die in this one.

The Doctor, his grand-daughter, and their two school-teacher friends arrive in Latin America during the early period of the Aztec ""empire.""  Barbara is mistaken for the reincarnation of a god; Ian is forced into a series of challenges against an Aztec warrior to see who will lead their army; the Doctor takes a wife (???  Yes, really!!!); and the group is faced with a hard truth:  there are some parts of history that you just cannot change even though they are horribly barbaric.  The high priest of knowledge and the high priest of sacrifice argue over whether Barbara really is their god, and Barbara tries to stop their practice of making human sacrifices even though the Doctor sternly advises her against meddling with history.  If you look closely (or not so closely) you'll notice a lot of mistakes that they made in the construction and lighting of this one; you can plainly tell that the backgrounds are painted onto bedsheets.  The villains are corny, but effectively frightening--to young kids.  And Hartnell shows some of what I think is his best acting in this one (as well as some of his worst).  He finally gets to let off some steam and really scold somebody!  Some of the themes they introduce here such as there being a specific order in the universe and the futility of changing the past will be revisited and expanded in later installments.  Even the current series in production is toying with some of those ideas.

This story is 4 episodes long, all of which are on the DVD.  There are a few special features on the first disk regarding the production of this series; there are several interviews (many years later) with surviving cast and crew.  The second disk has more special features, including a short documentary about the Aztec culture and their encounter with the Spanish Conquistadors and a reconstruction of a ""lost"" installment of the Doctor Who chronicles, plus a bunch of other stuff.",1384992000,,2117,4.743169398907104

I know the last scene of the story arc with the planet dying around Maaga exists. We didn't even see that.

Just so you know, a little more then half of this story is done with, ""Telesnaps."" Basically, Telesnaps are still photos of the picture as it was being filmed during TV production. The BBC produced an entirely remade version of Doctor Who's, ""Marco Polo"" using entirely just Telesnaps.  What makes this so awesome is how the BBC recently obtained footage of long lost segments of the original ""Galaxy 4"" story and combined them with previously owned Telesnaps to pull together the scenes still lost to time.  They also included some CGI and animations to complete the story and make it flow even better.  Basically, you end up with a pretty good interpretation of the WHOLE STORY!

The audio of Doctor Who's ""Galaxy 4"" already existed and so by putting everything together it is as close to watching the complete story (once thought lost for good). The original taping of ""Galaxy 4"" was scrapped about 10 years after the story was released, back in the 60's or early 70's, and this was unfortunately the usual way shows were handled during the 60's.  The producers of Doctor Who could have had no way of knowing that Doctor Who was going to become such a big hit and remain on air for another 50 years, which is why they destroyed many of these shows to the great loss of those that love everything ""Who'ish!""

It is a shame that as time marches on the possibilities of continuing to find these lost episodes or intact stories gets worse and worse. Therefore having the ability at hand to recreate entire stories like ""Galaxy 4"" are indeed such an unexpected treat for all of us.

Thanks for reading my review.

543522,5,6303058833,"I love Doctor Who's first season, and ""The Aztecs"" is arguably its high point. Certainly, compared to later Doctor Who serials, this one feels confined and stagey - more like a theatrical production than a TV show. But for me, that style comes with more positives than negatives.

John Lucarotti's intelligent script concerns the clash between 20th century British values and 15th century Aztec culture. The Doctor's companion, history teacher Barbara Wright, is mistaken for an Aztec goddess, and she tries to use her divine authority to destroy the Aztec tradition of human sacrifice. The Doctor, meanwhile, argues that Barbara cannot change the established pattern of history and is destined to fail. The various moral dilemmas raised by this situation are explored in an unusually thoughtful way (unusual not just for Doctor Who, but for TV in general).

""The Aztecs"" does have some production shortcomings, due to the fact that it was shot quickly, with really cumbersome cameras, in a tiny studio. Sometimes the camera wobbles. Sometimes the actors stumble over their lines. But given the ridiculous conditions under which this serial was filmed, I think it turned out rather well. Certainly, John Ringham gives one of the best villain performances in the history of Doctor Who. And ultimately, the story is so interesting - and the ending is so unusually grim and powerful - that the flaws are easy for me to overlook.

But what about the DVD itself? Well, I like it. I know that many Doctor Who fans resent buying special editions of previously released stories, but I don't mind so long as I detect some real improvements. Certainly, this version of ""The Aztecs"" has better picture and sound quality than the older DVD. The shades of black are deeper, and some hissy dialogue in part one has been cleaned up a bit.

The original Aztecs DVD had great special features, including some fun cast interviews, which are carried over on Disc One of this edition. Disc Two features a weird grab-bag of new features, many of which aren't really relevant to ""The Aztecs"" (a slight pet peeve of mine). Still, it's nice to get a reconstruction of the lost third-season story ""Galaxy 4,"" which includes the recently rediscovered part three. It's no classic, but it's a fun sci-fi story that makes an interesting contrast to the considerably smarter main feature.",1363392000,4,2358,4.977157360406092
543593,4,6303058833,It was good to see the older Dr. Who series.  They move at a much slower pace than current dr. Who's but it is interesting to see the history of the show.,1356220800,,154,3.8125
543594,5,6303058833,"This is a review of the 2003 one-disc DVD release of ""The Aztecs"".

Barbara and Susan exit the TARDIS to find themselves inside a stone room. Lying on a slab is a man's body, bedecked in jewelry and an ancient American mask. Barbara knows immediately that they're in the tomb of a very important Aztec priest, because Aztec history was one of her specialties. Susan shivers at the one thing she remembers about the Aztecs, that they performed human sacrifices. Then Barbara gives her some more background on the Aztecs, leading into one of the main plot points: ""[Human sacrifice is] only one side to their nature. The other side was highly civilized.... [The Spanish] only saw the acts of sacrifice. That was the tragedy of the Aztecs. The whole civilization was completely destroyed, the good as well as the evil.""

Susan finds a hidden door into another room, and goes back to the TARDIS to get Ian and the Doctor. Barbara, in the meanwhile goes through the door, which closes behind her, and is accosted by an angry Autloc, High Priest of Knowledge: ""Woman! ... You trespass and must be punished!""

Fortunately for Barbara, she had tried on a magnificent snake bracelet in the tomb, and is still wearing it when she's taken away. What do you know? Believing the tomb to be permanently sealed, the only way she could have gotten the bracelet is if she is the god Yetaxa, returned to her people.

Barbara really takes to the part, too, and when the others join her, they are amused to find that they are to play her servants. But then it turns serious. Yetaxa is to preside over a human sacrifice, and Barbara is determined to use her position to halt this Aztec practice. The Doctor is angry, but cannot convince her to leave history as it is. Barbara, you see, sees it as saving the Aztecs. If they don't practice human sacrifice, the Spanish will not kill Montezuma and raze the city.

Personally, given how Europeans treated conquests all over the world, I think it was wishful thinking. But in any case, nothing works out the way Barbara expects. Even the man who was to be sacrificed is not grateful. ""You have denied me honor,"" he tells her, before flinging himself off the top of the temple to his death. (It is a step pyramid, so the flinging couldn't have been too far.) So if the first theme of the serial is SHOULD we change history?, the second theme is CAN we change history?

After stopping his sacrifice, Tlotoxl, the High Priest of Sacrifice, is after Barbara's head, and out to convince Autloc that she is a false god. He knows that the easiest way to get to Yetaxa is through her servants, and the conniving begins. Ian must battle Ixta to the death for control of the army. Susan must be rescued from execution after she defiles a ceremony. And the Doctor? The whole reason our foursome has to go through this is because they can't find a way back into the inner tomb where the TARDIS awaits. The Doctor must do some conniving of his own, including fibbing to his accidental fiancee.

I'm not the biggest fan of Hartnell's historical, versus science fiction, serials. But the ""Aztecs"" does have more going for it, and I rate it 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. For one thing, John Ringham, as Tlotoxl, eats the scenery. He's over-the-top, practically Shakespearean and a joy to watch. And I think this is the first time we see the Doctor deny himself love, though he takes it pretty easily. Given the budget constraints, there are some great shots. Such as when Ixta mounts the temple stairs wearing his jaguar head and robe. You're looking down at him, and it's as if a jaguar is approaching. Though this episode doesn't have lots of science-fictiony stuff, it does have loads of psychology.

A two-disc DVD Special Edition of ""The Aztecs"" will be released in March 2013.

1.  Commentary, recorded in 2002. Participants are Verity Lambert (producer), Caroline Ford (Susan) and William Russell (Ian). On the appearance of Tlotoxl, Lambert says how he looks like Richard III. This is a relatively spare commentary. Often the three are just enjoying the show instead of talking. But it is still fun to listen to. Lambert, for example, mentions that, as producer, BBC allowed her only 4 edits per show. Fortunately, she was able to exceed that at times.
Ian mentions how great this episode was for Jacqueline Hill, who plays Barbara. She has a bigger, more central and complex role than usual.
2.  ""Remembering the Aztecs"" (25 minutes) This is casual interviews with Ian Cullen (played Ixta), John Ringham (Tlotoxl) and Walter Randall (Tonila, the Aztec instructor at the school where Susan is sent to learn how to be a good wife). Most of the interviews are spent talking about ""The Aztecs"" and its actors, but there's also interesting stuff about the early days of TV. Cullen starts off saying, ""It's very hard to explain to anyone now what it was like in those days. Television was itself new and strange.""
Ringham, who's gleeful performance I like so much, is disparaging of his acting in ""The Aztecs"", which he just viewed again after many years, in preparation for the interview: ""It's such a patent Laurence Olivier performance... I know I didn't intend it to be! [I] even did Richard III, the shoulder up here!"" But he did achieve what director John Crockett told him to do: ""Make all the children in the country hate you"".
3.  ""Cortez & Montezuma"" (15 minutes) This was part of a Blue Peter TV show episode, ""Expedition to Mexico"", first broadcast in September 1970. Valerie Singleton tells the story of how Montezuma and Cortes met in November, 1519, and the consequences. It includes Valerie speaking on location from Tenochtitlan, the great city built on a lake.
4.  ""Restoring the Aztecs"" (14 minutes) This short gives details on how the serial was restored for the 2003 DVD release. They show comparisons of old and new footage, and captions explain the changes. Footage is shown from ""The Aztecs"", a Jon Pertwee episode, and Patrick Troughton's ""The Krotons"".
5.  ""TARDIS-Cam No. 3"" (1 minute)
6.  Intro Sequences. If you select ""play all"" on the main menu, you'll get a short introductory message before the Dr. Who theme starts. There are six intro sequences, spoken by different actors. Which one you'll see is randomly selected.
7.  Information Text
8.  ""Designing the Aztecs"" (25 minutes) This is an interview with Barry Newbery, designer. He designed everything you see on screen except the costumes. And I think he did a heck of a job, too. The interview is a little dry, but the details are interesting, and there's lots of photos.
9.  ""Making Cocoa"" (4 minutes) An animation of Tlotoxl and Tonila telling how and why cocoa is made. John Ringham and Walter Randall do the voices.
10. Audio Options. The Commentary (which I moved up to #1) and an Arabic version of episode 4 only.
11. Photo Gallery. Some photos are in color, and the costumes are colorful.
12. Who's Who. Short written biographies/filmographies.

543595,5,6303058833,"Barbara and Susan exit the TARDIS to find themselves inside a stone room. Lying on a slab is a man's body, bedecked in jewelry and an ancient American mask. Barbara knows immediately that they're in the tomb of a very important Aztec priest, because Aztec history was one of her specialties. Susan shivers at the one thing she remembers about the Aztecs, that they performed human sacrifices. Then Barbara gives her some more background on the Aztecs, leading into one of the main plot points: ""[Human sacrifice is] only one side to their nature. The other side was highly civilized.... [The Spanish] only saw the acts of sacrifice. That was the tragedy of the Aztecs. The whole civilization was completely destroyed, the good as well as the evil.""

Susan finds a hidden door into another room, and goes back to the TARDIS to get Ian and the Doctor. Barbara, in the meanwhile goes through the door, which closes behind her, and is accosted by an angry Autloc, High Priest of Knowledge: ""Woman! ... You trespass and must be punished!""

Fortunately for Barbara, she had tried on a magnificent snake bracelet in the tomb, and is still wearing it when she's taken away. What do you know? Believing the tomb to be permanently sealed, the only way she could have gotten the bracelet is if she is the god Yetaxa, returned to her people.

Barbara really takes to the part, too, and when the others join her, they are amused to find that they are to play her servants. But then it turns serious. Yetaxa is to preside over a human sacrifice, and Barbara is determined to use her position to halt this Aztec practice. The Doctor is angry, but cannot convince her to leave history as it is. Barbara, you see, sees it as saving the Aztecs. If they don't practice human sacrifice, the Spanish will not kill Montezuma and raze the city.

Personally, given how Europeans treated conquests all over the world, I think it was wishful thinking. In any case, nothing works out the way Barbara expects. Even the man who was to be sacrificed is not grateful. ""You have denied me honor,"" he tells her, before flinging himself off the top of the temple to his death. (It is a step pyramid, so the flinging couldn't have been too far.) So if the first theme of the serial is SHOULD we change history?, the second theme is CAN we change history?

After she stops his sacrifice, Tlotoxl, the High Priest of Sacrifice, is after Barbara's head, and out to convince Autloc that she is a false god. Tlotoxl knows that the easiest way to get to Yetaxa is through her servants, and the conniving begins. Ian must battle Ixta to the death for control of the army. Susan must be rescued from execution after she defiles a ceremony. And the Doctor? The whole reason our foursome has to go through this is because they can't find a way back into the inner tomb where the TARDIS awaits. The Doctor must do some conniving of his own, including fibbing to his accidental fiancee.

I'm not the biggest fan of Hartnell's historical, versus science fiction, serials. But the ""Aztecs"" does have more going for it, so I rate it 4 1/2 stars, rounded up to 5. For one thing, John Ringham, as Tlotoxl, eats the scenery. He's over-the-top, practically Shakespearean and a joy to watch. And I think this is the first time we see the Doctor deny himself love, though he takes it pretty easily. In spite of budget constraints, there are some great shots. Such as when Ixta mounts the temple stairs wearing his jaguar head and robe. You're looking down at him, and it's as if a jaguar is approaching. Though this episode doesn't have lots of science-fictiony stuff, it does have loads of psychology.

This is a review of the Special Edition DVD of ""The Aztecs"", to be released March 2013 on two discs. It will be four episodes totaling 99 minutes, in full frame video, mono audio, with English subtitles available.

""The Aztecs"" was previously released on DVD in 2003, on a single disc.

543596,5,6303058833,"When Doctor Who started, the idea was to mix adventure with History---after all, what would you do with a Time Machine except go back in history. It is a shame, though, that most of the early ""historical adventures"" of Doctor Who were lost (Lost isn't the best word to use, either, since the tapes were purposely wiped to be re-used). It seems that the BBC did not think the shows were of value, particularly the ones dealing with historical events, like ""Marco Polo"" and ""The Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day Eve"", since supposedly they got lower ratings than the 'space monster' stories. That is a real shame, if you can judge the quality of the ""history"" shows on ""THE AZTECS"". This story is well-written, about as historically accurate as you can expect in a drama (and also a children's program); it was well acted and well-produced, given the program's small budget. I'm too young to have seen these shows when they originally aired, so I suppose I'll never see the couple of dozen WHO's that are no longer in existance. I do recommend ""The Aztecs"" and thank goodness it is still available.",1354665600,,1097,4.71875
543597,5,6303058833,Great story (for the period)  The Doctor and Companions first real brush with tampering with history...a must have for any Whovian that is interested in how it all started!,1320710400,,172,4.931034482758621
543598,5,6303058833,i use to love to watch dr who but offten as not i wond up missing some odd episodes so now i watch the dr who and know that ive watched every episode of them all,1315094400,,161,3.5
543599,3,6303058833,"This was not as good as the Keys of Marinus (Story 5), but wasn't horrible. Includes episodes 27-30 of season one.",1307836800,,114,4.476190476190476
543600,5,6303058833,"When Doctor Who started it was considered a children's show that was supposed to help educate and enlighten viewers.  During its first few years it alternated between sci-fi and historical stories.  IMHO The Aztecs is the best of the (still existing) historical Doctor Who stories.  The Doctor and his companions arrive in the temple of a dead Aztec priest.  Barbara is mistaken for a reincarnation of the dead priest, and uses her new authority to try to change history so the Aztecs won't be destroyed when Cortez arrives years later.  Deceit, betrayal, even a little romance for the Doctor spice up the plot.  Pretty heavy stuff for a kids' show.
This was produced in a different age.  Mostly shot live in the studio with a multi-camera setup, not shot and then edited later like shows are today.  And in black and white, but don't let that prevent you from watching this.  Wonderfully acted by the entire cast, especially Jackie Hill who played Barbara.  Independent, resourceful female companions on Doctor Who didn't just start in 2005 with Billie Piper in the new Who series.  Barbara was the blueprint for all the Doctor Who girls (when their parts were written correctly).
The picture and sound are nicely restored.
There are some good extras on here.  The commentary with the late Verity Lambert, and actors Carol Ann Ford and William Russell is pretty light.  It is enjoyable listening to them remember things about the production, and hear them enjoy watching the story again.
Again I highly recommend this.  If you are a fan of new Doctor Who and want a taste of William Hartnell's Doctor, this is a really good place to start. This DVD has been out for a few years so the price has dropped.  I got it for under $10.",1306368000,4,1729,4.716666666666667
543601,5,6303058833,"""The Aztecs"" is the oldest of Doctor Who's ""historical"" adventures to survive erasure from the BBC archives, and it's perhaps the first Doctor's best. What a comeback from the train wreck that was the Doctor's previous adventure, ""The Keys of Marinus""! The set and costume design in ""The Aztecs"" was meticulous in its detail and spared nothing in pursuit of historical accuracy. It's a pity these episodes had to be shot in black-and-white, because the elaborate costumes and headdresses, featuring colorful feathers and jaguar skins, were made in full color (check out the Photo Gallery to see what viewers missed).

Doctor Who began in 1963 as an educational children's program, and ""The Aztecs"" is a great introduction to the pedagogical side of Doctor Who's mission, giving serious viewers an engaging historical drama without all the hoo-hah of the Daleks and so forth. I rarely give Doctor Who DVDs five stars, reserving that honor for only the best adventures, but I give this one four for its story and one extra for the extensive Special Features menu, which makes this disc far and away the best value in the series at under $15.

The entire cast, including the principal players, turn in solid performances with only a few fluffed lines, but top honors go to John Ringham, who channels Richard III through Alice Cooper to create the story's chief villain, Tlotoxl, the High Priest of Sacrifice. A fascinating interview in the Special Features menu reveals Ringham as a journeyman character actor who played a long list of minor roles on stage, TV and film and was passionate about his craft (he died in 2008).

Another important record for posterity can be found in the audio commentary, which features Doctor Who's first producer, Verity Lambert, a creative firebrand who played a pivotal role in developing the series and defending the program before the BBC establishment. (She pushed for better production facilities for ""The Aztecs,"" for instance, and the show was moved, for two episodes, from the Lime Grove studios to the more modern BBC Television Centre.) When she came to Doctor Who in 1963, Lambert was the youngest and only female producer at the BBC (she died in 2007).",1263600000,,2194,4.9727520435967305
543602,5,6303058833,"You'd hardly think that this was a science fiction series if this was your first Doctor Who story- and yet, the Aztecs culture are so alien to people, that it's really like looking at another world- in an Earthbound serial!

And people talk about four people in the TARDIS being too many- here it actually works. Each member ends up going their different way- and with each person you learn a different part of the Aztec culture, so much so, that by the end of the four episodes, it's like watching a blockbuster. All done in the studio- which had me totally surprised when I found out, the ""outdoor"" scenes in the garden are extremely convincing (Are you reading this, those who prefer style over substance? Doctor Who can do both at the same time!). John Ringham as Tltoxol is easily as fierce a villain as any alien.

But the real star is Barbara, who's mistaken for the god known as Yetaxa, and is forced not to reveal her true identity to the public. Barbara could easily stand up next to Rose and Martha as one of the best companions, and in many ways even eclipses them. She is the central character here, and Jacqui Hill grabs the opportunity. There are several moments, when Ian's about to be killed, and Tltoxol challenges, ""if you are Yetaxa, save him!"" Barbara holds a knife to his throat, and forces them to let Ian go! Another when Tltoxol tries to prove she is a mortal by having her drink some poison, with Ian signalling in the background, she turns it around on them and reveals their treason! All this while trying to get rid of the evil in the Aztecs, with their blood sacrifices and such, so that only the good survive when Cortes lands and the Aztecs will survive. A good idea in theory, but as the Doctor so eloquently states, ""You can't rewrite history. Not one line!""

Still, The Aztecs is probably the best William Hartnell story around, and really shows that you don't need to always have futuristic aliens in sci-fi.",1201996800,4,1944,4.532763532763533
543659,5,6303058833,"The early episodes of ""Doctor Who"" are just plain excellent, and ""The Aztecs"" (one of the earliest, and beautifully restored for this DVD) is a perfect case in point. This is one of the more down to earth adventures, as the Doctor and his companions find themselves separated from the TARDIS (their ever undependable space/time vehicle) and trapped in Mexico during the flourishing years of the Aztec Empire. No robots or aliens here, no lasers or sonic screwdrivers, just cultural incompatibility and the contradictions of human nature. In fact, this may be one of the most philosophically disturbing  ""Doctor Who"" storylines I've ever watched; every time the four protagonists' cultural values grate against or collide with those of the Aztec people around them, they get more entangled in a complex chain of events leading them inexorably towards disaster--and any idealistic attempts on their part to encourage what they (and we) approve of in Aztec culture while abolishing what strikes them (and us) as savage inevitably backfires and accelerates this downward spiral. In the end they don't make a dent in the course of history, and are rather lucky even to escape with their lives (I hope this isn't a spoiler, since anyone reading this can see that the same characters show up for ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" later). The narrative is for the most part uncomfortably agnostic, too, inviting us to see how counterintuitive and inscrutable their attitudes and behavior are to the Aztec people they're interacting with. In the end, who's to say? Somehow this whole theme is summed up nicely in a dialogue between Barbara and Tlotoxl (the high priest of sacrifice), who asks her:
""How shall a man know his gods?""
""By the signs of their divinity.""
""And what if thieves walk among the gods?""
""Then, indeed, how shall a man know?""

On top of this superb storytelling we get gorgeous and convincingly accurate sets and costumes--the BBC has always cornered the market when it comes to historical dramas, though this is a more unorthodox application of their skills and talents in this area. What's more, the Doctor finds a little romance, Ian does what looks like a Vulcan nerve-pinch on an Aztec warrior, Barbara takes center stage with her knowledge of history and decks herself out like a divine high-priestess, and Susan manages not to give out one of her shrill, window-breaking screams for the whole duration of the show--which must be an all-time record.",1170460800,7,2462,5.0024390243902435
543660,5,6303058833,"Doctor Who The Aztecs is the sixth story, featuring the First Doctor and his companions Ian, Barbara and Susan.  They materialize in the center of the Ancient Aztec empire and Barbara decides she wishes to change history (it seems that she admired the Aztec civilization and wants to destroy the bad parts and leave only the good ones).  It is an interesting lesson against meddling with time and with other cultures.  Of course everything goes wrong and it takes all the wits and intelligence of all four of them to get away.

The four episodes have been restored to their original glory and the disc has tons of extras, with behind the scene features, a short on how to make cocoa which looks like a South Park cartoon, commentary for all episodes, the photo gallery, the always interesting production notes and even a short history lesson on Cortez and Montezuma.",1153872000,,866,4.753333333333333
543661,5,6303058833,"Overall, this story is a good Doctor Who story. It is the first instance in the program where the TARDIS crew (specifically Barbara here) try to manipulate and change known history. I won't tell you if she succeeds or fails, though.

This story is overall a dry one, but that may be that the science fiction element is gone from most of it. Fan-boys call them ""historicals"".

Anyway, the Doctor, Ian, and Barbara all have strong parts and are enjoyable to watch (especially the Doctor with Camecia); yet Susan could have been written out completely with no real loss to the story.

I enjoy extras on DVDs, yet dislike how ""hidden"" features are on some DVDs (ie, Easter Eggs). This one has random sayings that play at the beginning of an episode. It took me something like 30 times to hear all the sayings, and that was my major dislike.

Overall, I liked it. And, if you wonder what the ending (after part 4) is referring to, then you need to watch ""The Sensorites"" (not yet available on DVD).",1140566400,,993,4.5307262569832405
543662,5,6303058833,"I've been re-acquainting myself with DOCTOR WHO through the continuing DVD releases,  and I found this one to be a revelation.  Amazon already has the plot synopsis on this page, so I won't repeat the story details,  but I will say that this one is far, far more exciting than I was expecting.  It's like a mini-Shakespeare play inserted into the fantastical world of DOCTOR WHO,  but it works surprisingly well.  The BBC has a reputation for classy drama productions,  and I'm guessing they instinctively know how to pull something like this off much easier than one of DOCTOR WHO's more usual way-out alien environments.

Unlike most DOCTOR WHO stories, the science-fiction elements are minimal; aside from the Doctor's time machine that gets them to the past, there's next to none at all.  The story begins when the travellers are seperated from their time-machine; from there, it's about the local intrigue they get involved in out of necessity, to stay alive long enough to get back to it and escape.  Like all DOCTOR WHO stories, it's broken into multiple episodes, with cliff-hanger endings that defy you not to watch the next installment.

Of course, this is a very old set of episodes, from an entirely different country with its own style of TV and in black & white.  I imagine it's quite different to anything American viewers are used to, even ones who like old-school TV shows.  In fact, it's *very* like a stage-play written for television  -  but what a great play it is!  It reminds me of a great episode of ""Masterpiece Theatre"", full of double-crosses, court intrigue, and all the staples of classic drama.  If that sounds appealing to you, by all means get this.  It's actually a shame that this is filed under sci-fi in a way, because it's a much richer production than a lot of what gets dumped in that genre.

The bonus features are impressive for something 40+ years old.  There's a making of documentary with the guest stars; a commentary by the surviving regulars; optional on-screen  captions;  and a feature on restoring the picture quality - all of which describe how productions like this were made.  I found them all entertaining and informative.  There's also a mini-documentary on the Aztec civilization, from a vintage British kids' show (which shows how little really smart kids' fare there is these days),  and a silly feature about making cocoa, animated ""South Park"" style and using the voices of the original guest cast.  It's all very impressive stuff that really adds to the DVD's entertainment and re-watching value.

Incidentally, the previous one-star review states that DOCTOR WHo didn't actually look like this on first broadcast,  but he's mistaken.  This is precisely the presentation and style of how it looked on,  and the picture quality is stunning.",1139097600,8,2800,4.895744680851064
543663,4,6303058833,"A classic Dr. Who episode!! While not as exciting as other stories, ""The Aztecs"" is an important episode. It showcases a formula; historical stories, that was hardly used in later episodes. I always enjoyed watching the Doctor & co. travel back in time and getting caught up in a pivotal point in history. This story uses that formula and the delivery is flawless. The other important note about this episode, is it shows us a rare glimpse into the Doctor's love-life as he courts an Aztec matron. This is a must have for any Definitive Dr. Who collection.",1121731200,,556,4.683673469387755
543664,5,6303058833,"It should be remembered, before the casual buyer adds this to his or her list, that this story was recorded a month after the Beatles first played Ed Sullivan in 1964. That should put you in the right frame of mind for what you will see. Its low-low budget by today's standards and some will question why its on DVD at all.

Not me. I'm a fan and we fans love Doctor Who for what it is, a show that achieved miracles of narrative fiction in spite of its own budget deficiencies. Like James Bonds, there are many Doctors (not Doctor Who). Unlike Bond, there is an explanation (called regeneration) for this change of actor.

The Aztecs is the first William Hartnell story to get to DVD and has been lovingly restored to look as close to its original video tape format. Its a tale of historical intrigue, set before the Spanish destroyed the ancient Aztec culture. If you can get past the fact that everyone in the cast is English, you will see that the story is very faithful to the culture. In fact, this is considered a classic in fan circles. ""You cannot change history. Not one line.""",1119571200,2,1087,4.43
543665,5,6303058833,"The Aztecs was the 6th storyline of the first doctor, William Hartnell.  This was one of the Historical Doctor Who episodes, and a fascinating one at that.  Watching this story, you can see the appeal of the doctor.  He goes everywhere in and out of time and space.  He has knowledge that only a time traveller of his caliber could possess.  He wants to learn as much as he can about the places and people he visits.  In this particular show the Doctor and his companions travel back into earth's time to when the Aztec culture was flourishing.  It is a great story, and makes me wish that the oldest historical Dr. Who storyline: ""Marco Polo"" had survived.  The DVD quality is excellent, and if someone wants to watch it with the quality it was originally aired, then they would need a Tardis in order to do that.  But the rest of us who regret the fragility of the first two doctors' stories (over 1/3 are presumably lost forever), a disc like this is most welcome.  ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" and ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" are also fantastic.  Here is hoping that more of the first two Dr.s are released on DVD in such a respectful way!",1074988800,5,1139,4.427884615384615
543666,1,6303058833,"Aztecs is one of the all-time Dr Who masterpieces. However, this dvd version fails. The episodes have been painstakingly ""restored"" to ""look as it would have done in 1964"". However, no one in 1964 had high-definition televisions, and so this glossy adjustment looks absolutely nothing as it would have done at its original broadcast. Dr Who has here been given a crystal-clear clarity that it is simply not meant to have. Consequently, it is robbed of its atmosphere. Instead of a trip to old Mexico filled with suspense and intrigue, what we see are actors in a studio. The illusion is ruined, and with it, its beauty. The Aztecs is a fantastic bit of magic, but this dvd is just a tragic bit of plastic.
It's bad enough there are so many episodes of Dr Who missing. Can we please refrain from tampering with the ones we do have? Dr Who is perfect as it is. ""Improvement"" is not necessary and can only end in this kind of disaster. All we want is completeness, a series uncut, so we can judge the show for ourselves and enjoy it in our own way.

543667,5,6303058833,"""The Aztecs"" is considered by many to be the First Doctor's finest episode. Having seen it many years ago on public TV, at the time I thought it a bit dull. But I have I to report that this DVD is one of the best Who discs to date.
First off, using some fancy new restoration program, the Aztecs now looks as it was originally transmitted all those years ago. Suddenly, the whole thing comes to life. Now I love the story. You can appreciate the actor's performances so much better. The story of the restoration is one of the documentaries on the DVD.
There are also a ton of extras including interviews with the actors who portrayed the Aztecs and the set designer.
This is a ""Must Have"" for any Who enthusiast. I hope they give the same treatment to ""An Unearthly Child"" some day.",1057449600,11,782,4.363013698630137

This classic 1964 adventure features the original cast lineup in top form, including one of William Hartnell's best performances as the Doctor. The disc features a wealth of great extras, most notably interviews and entertaining commentary by surviving cast members. The real star of this disc, however, is Doctor Who's legendary Restoration Team, who have once again worked their dazzling magic to make this adventure look as good as it did when transmitted. Amazing!
The Aztecs is highly recommended as an essential part of your Who collection.",1052611200,,646,5.3431372549019605
543729,5,6303058833,"The Aztecs was one Doctor Who story where it all came together - cast, director, set design, writer, and musicians all worked well to make an interesting, educational story about one of our most fascinating ancient civilisations. Forget science-fiction for a minute, this is a story about people and how they behave to one another. Barbara's disgust at the Aztecs' sacrifice and the Doctor's acceptance of different cultural values will no doubt reflect our own feelings. The way the TARDIS crew behaves towards the indigenous people tells us something about how early colonisers behaved, and also how explorers and documentary makers now treat isolated tribes and peoples. There is a strong dramatic story here, and John Ringham's Tlotoxl makes an excellent villain, while all of the regular cast are good in their own way. There are a few shortcomings which can be put down to the television production values of the day, such as the rather choreographed look of the fight sequences and the painted look of some of the backcloths, but the accompanying documentaries explain these. It is remarkable to consider that the story was made in Studio D at Lime Grove which in its later years the BBC considered only suitable for current affairs programmes and far too small for drama.
The DVD is one of the best I have seen. The BBC seems to be taking a pride in their picture and sound quality now, as well as giving a decent number of well-made extras.
The picture has been extensively restored from a filmed copy of a video recording, with much effort spent to eliminate scratches, missing frames, distortion and sound problems. This release also benefits from the new Vidfire system which converts the sometimes jerky look of filmed television into a smooth looking video picture. This looks so good, you would think it was recorded yesterday if it had not been black and white.
The commentary is interesting, featuring the two surviving lead actors, Carole Ann Ford (Susan) and William Russell (Ian) plus the series' producer Verity Lambert. There is an element of memory loss which is unsurprising after nearly forty years, and this means that it is probably about right to have three people doing the commentary. The information subtitles are similarly useful but more thorough, however I think these should be written after the commentary to avoid duplication and to correct any mistakes the cast may make in remembering things.
There is a comic section on how to make coffee Aztec style with John Ringham and Walter Randall supplying voice-overs to a South Park style cartoon of their Doctor Who characters Tlotoxl and Tonila. This has to be seen to believed. Unfortunately Randall seems to have forgotten how to act, but full marks to him for taking part. The same two actors are featured in a short documentary 'Remembering The Aztecs', alongside an impossibly young looking Ian Cullen. All three have interesting things to say about the story, its production, and its stars. The actors also each contribute two spoken introductions to the story, selected at random when the story is played.
Set designer Barry Newbery contributes another short documentary about his work on the serial, well illustrated with his own superb photographs (some in colour). Another short piece shows the viewer what efforts have been made to restore the picture and sound, a textbook example of video restoration. I usually find DVD photo galleries rather boring, but the gallery on this disc is presented more imaginatively - the pictures fade swiftly from one to the next with a nice frame and sound effect.
There is the now standard TARDIS Cam - all very well done, but what is the point of them? Except to show what the BBC Special effects department could do these days if only the BBC commissioned another series of Doctor Who! Another odd inclusion (Useful for completists) is the option to select an Arabic soundtrack for episode 4. I think I might try this one day for fun! The disc is rounded off with a small except from Blue Peter with Val Singleton sitting on the steps of a Ziggurat telling the story of Cortez and Montezuma.
I recommend this disc for anyone who is interested in 1960s television production, Aztec history, or who just wants to watch a cracking Doctor Who story.",1049760000,10,4279,4.911602209944752
543730,5,6303058833,"It seems naive to keep declaring every new ""Doctor Who"" DVD release the ""best one ever"", but I think ""The Aztecs"" actually fits the bill this time.  I mean, compared to one of the earliest releases (""Spearhead From Space"", about which I raved), this disc really seems to have an impossibly high numbers of features and improvements.
Most notably is frame-by-frame restoration of the story.  Part and parcel of being a ""Doctor Who"" fan is accepting the show's poor visual look.  Not poor as in aged special effects or wobbly sets, but poor as in picture quality.  ""Who"" was always recorded on videotape, but the tape from the show's entire 1960s run has long since been destroyed, and those episodes are only available now on ancient, scratchy film transfers.  ""The Aztecs"" DVD doesn't miraculously unearth the original videotapes... but it does run the film through a special restoration process which mostly restores the old video look.  No scratches, no jumps, this time.  Now you can see the original sets and flimsy decorations in all their harsh studio-light glare, and you can see those lights reflected in all the actors' foreheads.
Now, while I'm sure most people who still watch ""Doctor Who"" don't watch it for picture quality, these DVDs do serve an extreme niche market, and it's nice to know that someone on the DVD-production end is actually trying to put out a worthwhile product.
Apart from the story (which is so brilliant that I won't do it the injustice of a 3-sentence plot summary), the DVD also benefits from the inclusion of the original actors in the special features.  The audio commentary track is a major disappointment.  Actor William Russell (Ian) is so old that he doesn't seem to realize he's watching a younger version of himself.  Carole Anne Ford (Susan) was on vacation for most of ""The Aztecs"", so her comments are limited to several variations on ""Oh, that's pretty!"".  The star of the commentary is the show's original producer, Verity Lambert, though there was slightly less insight on ""Doctor Who""'s beginnings than I expected.  I do hope she'll be included on future Season 1 DVDs
Three actors from the ""Aztec""'s secondary cast take part in a 30-minute ""Remembering the Aztecs"" featurette.  Ian Cullen (Ixta) sits at a table in a garden, reading from a very visible script, although his glasses are off.  Walter Randall (Tonila) and John Ringham (Tlotoxl, a name not pronounced the same way twice throughout the entire story) sit together on a couch, Randall with his shirt unbuttoned and navel revealed.  What's up with that?  Best of all, Randall and Ringham provide *new* character voices for a hilarious animated short (""Making Cocoa"") done in South-Park style, and all three record in-character voice introductions when you select the ""Play All"" option.  And look for the easter egg hidden on the Special Features menu.
There's also a nice 5-minute history lesson on the Aztecs, thrown in from a 1971 children's TV program.  The half-hour interview with the episode's set designer, Barry Newbery, goes on a bit too long, but again, these DVDs are aimed at the kind of audience that might appreciate this sort of excess.
Happily, the usually interminable photo gallery now plays by itself, so you don't have to stab the ""next"" button on your remote every 3 seconds.  The photos are mostly useless, but the color snapshots are fun, since you can see what the costumes were actually supposed to look like, before the 1964 story was recorded in glorious Black-&-White-O-Vision.",1048896000,4,3518,4.9523809523809526
543731,5,6303058833,"A chance to see one of the earliest Doctor Who stories is a chance any fan should jump at, especially considering the wonderful clean-up achieved by the restoration team. The picture and sound are great and getting a chance to see the First Doctor in such digital clarity is a rare treat indeed. Hartnell was always a strong actor and even though the Doctor takes a backseat in some scenes (companion Barbara is the star of this story) he easily steals the show every time he reappears.
For such an early point in the show's history the production values are surprisingly high and all of the performers carry the production flawlessly, even during potential gaffe moments (these early episodes were recorded ""live"" rather than take by take) and the few special effects are well done and heighten the drama nicely (the tunnel filling with water is a perfect example). It's the earliest of the show's historical dramas (Marco Polo, unfortunately, no longer exists) and thus gives modern-day fans a chance to see what the show's original format was intended to be; fascinating stuff considering what it became.
The DVD extras are quite nice, for the documentaries are well-made and very informative and the animated short ""Making Cocoa"" is nothing short of hilarious. The audio commentary is fun to listen to (it is especially nice to have two of the original performers appear) and the pop-up production text presents some truly interesting tidbits.
In short, this is a must-have for Doctor Who fans.",1047859200,2,1498,4.948412698412699

The Aztecs is their first region 1 release that fully takes advantage of their patented VidFIRE technology.  VidFIRE seamlessly blends the 24 frame per second look of the film prints into a near perfect match to the 50 frame per second look of the program as it appeared on television in the mid-60s.  A short clip of this process was made available on the Tomb DVD, but here it truly gets to be shown off, and what a display it is.  Words can't fully describe just how beautiful and realistic VidFIRE is.  The touch up work is also far better than what was used on the Tomb DVD.

543733,4,6303058833,"If you're already a Dr. Who fan then purchase of this DVD is a no brainer.  If you're not, then it's a good place to begin.  Originally aired during the shows first season, The Aztecs is only the sixth ever Doctor Who story.  The first doctor (played by William Hartnell) and his companions arrive on earth in the late 1400's in the middle of an Aztec temple.  The original companions include the Doctor's grand daughter Susan and her teachers Barbera and Ian.  Barbera puts on an Aztec medallion and is mistaken for a reincarnated high priestess.  As such, she decides to influence the Aztec culture by putting an end to human sacrifices.  As a result, Ian and Susan are placed in danger and it is up to the Doctor to save his friends and preserve history.  William Hartnell's portrayal of the doctor is excellent.  As a fan of Dr Who, it is fun to watch these early episodes and see how the show evolved over the years.  For example, most of the early shows were based on interacting with earth's historical figures as opposed to alien races.  Additionally, the concept of the Timelord race had not yet been introduced.
The quality of the DVD is top notch.  Many of these early episodes have been lost, and those that survive are in bad condition.  As with the earlier release of ""Tomb of the Cybermen"", the Aztecs has been meticulously restored to perfection.  There are a couple of nice extras including interviews with three of the surviving cast members.  Their take on the show and Hartnell's infamous ""difficult"" personality are well worth the time to watch.  There's also a short film that compares the original unrestored print of the film to the final restored product.
The Aztecs is an absolute gem and an essential addition to any Doctor Who DVD library.  Fans of classic sci-fi should also considering acquiring this piece of sci-fi television history.  If you're just starting a Doctor Who library or have never seen the show, this is an excellent place to start followed by the aforementioned Patrick Troughton adventure ""Tomb of the Cybermen"" and the John Pertwee's take on the doctor in ""Spearhead from Space"".",1047513600,3,2128,4.752043596730245

This soon leads to Barbara making a foolish attempt to stop the human sacrifices, thus starting a chain of events that would preserve the Aztec society.  This is a great adventure as it stands as an example of wanting so much to do something you believe to be the right thing, but forced not to interfere in order to preserve the bigger picture.  In this case that would be the future of the world in general.  I also love this adventure as it showcases the romantic side of Doctor Who, in his interactions with the lovely Cameca.  It was very funny to see his reaction when he had discovered that by helping Cameca to prepare some cocoa for them to drink, he had inadvertantly proposed marriage to her.  It was a romance that was bittersweet in the end, as the Doctor had no choice but to leave Cameca behind.  I definitely recommend this to anyone just starting their Dr. Who collection.",1035417600,2,1127,4.517241379310345

543736,5,6303058833,"As a number of Amazon reviewers have recognised the Doctor Who series as other BBC productions always had a strong educational aspect.
It would be a mistake however to characterise Doctor Who as a show which alternated the science fiction side with the historical dramas. While it may be convenient to present the show in that way I do not think that the portrayal is an accurate one. To begin with, each of the shows contained some form of educational aspect whether it be a historical point or about how people behave towards one another or whether some way out scientific theory was a possibility or not. The BBC Charter requires the corporation to educate as well as entertain and this is did.
There are particular aspects of the Aztecs which highlight the available knowledge of the Aztec civilisation which are contained within this four part show. What your readers may not know is that around the same time as this story was made, the second Doctor, Patrick Troughton starred in another central American ancient civilisation drama which ran over several weeks which was also true to the then knowledge of those civilisation.
What is more important to me than the concern with the historical nature of the story is the fact that several issues are addressed for the first time which turn up throughout the lifetime(s) of the show. For example the morality of interfering in a civilisation to achieve a different outcome than that which originally occurred. This is particularly important when the Doctor is returned to the point of the creation of the Daleks in the Fourth Doctor series. Another concern here is the position of women's lib which Susan adopts in the show. Given that the filming occurred in 1963 as the fledgling women's movement was taking off it can hardly be a coincidence. Finally we find the Doctor becoming involved in a relationship with an Aztec noblewomen which he is forced to end in order to escape with his companions. Unless my memory escapes me this is the only time that this happens and the Doctor is left unencumbered by this emotional side for the rest of his lives only showing affection for his companions henceforth.
These are the more serious themes which warrant exploration and debate from the Aztecs adventure and to a considerable extent the historical drama is more of a sub-plot for a broader examination of the then contemporary Western society in the guise of this adventure.
Well worth watching.",1019520000,6,2449,4.861244019138756
543737,4,6303058833,"When Doctor Who began in 1963 the intention was that the childrens programme would have two elements as a mix in the stories.  Having a machine that could travel through time and space, the TARDIS, meant that two types of story could be used: science fiction and history.  The basis of the show could be seen in the original cast.  Of the Doctor's original companions two are school teachers, Ian Chesterton - a science teacher; Barbara Wright - a history teacher.  The interests and strrengths of each were used in these early stories.
In the early days of Doctor Who historical alternated with science fiction; but from late December 1963 with the popular and critical success of the first appearance of the Daleks it was apparent that the series was to focus more on science fiction than history.  In some ways that is unfortunate.  Science fiction tends to reflect the time in which it is produced, and years later ideas that seemed futuristic at the time of original production later seem laughable.  This is the case with much of the early sc-fi in 1960s Doctor Who.  In the surviving stories (or parts of stories) from this era it is apparent that the historical stories have worn better.  The king of the historicals was scriptwriter John Lucarotti.  During William Hartnell's reign as the Doctor Lucarotti produced three excellent scripts, Marco Polo (soon to be available in an audio only CD version); The MAssacre of St Bartholomew's Eve (available in the UK in an audio version as all original episdoes have been destroyed); and the story under review, The Aztecs.
The Aztecs is one of the best early stories.  The TARDIS arrives in the tomb of an Aztec high priest some years before the arrival of Cortes.  While exploring Barbara is mistaken for the reincarnation of the high priest and is acclaimed a goddess.  The Doctor, Ian, and Susan are viewed as her servants.  Barbara fascinated by the strengths of Aztec culture takes it upon herself to use her position as goddess to change the Aztec culture of human sacrifice.  The Doctor is askance concerned that  time travellers cannot change history.
While Barbara enjoys some success with persuasion of one of the high priests, her position upsets the high priest of sacrifice who determines that he must show she is a false goddess, and must deal with her companions.
The four parter is just the right length and - for what was at the time still children's television - the characterisation is subtle and revealing of aspects of Aztec culture.  Particularly impressive is Lucarotti's drawing of the two high priests - the head and the heart of Aztec society.  Both have clear beliefs, both have their beliefs challenged by the time travellers intervention.
There are fight scenes, a putative love interest for Hartnell's Doctor (the scenes played by Hartnell with his ageing female companion are a delight), and consideration of big cultural and moral questions.  When in another culture simply because you, with western liberal values, disapprove of the characteristics of that culture, do you have a right to demand that it change?  In one stark conflict barbara is presented with a sacrifice she attempts to prevent, where the victim wishes to die for the honour that will be brought upon him and his family.
This is highly recommended for Doctor Who fans. While in black and white, the picture quality has held up reasonably well, and the regular cast are well settled in their parts. This coupled with the superior script, and the neat characterisation make this a must have for Time Lord fans.
if you enjoy this try to get hold of The Crusade, two episodes of which are available on video (together with CD for the missing episodes) coupled with Glyn Jones' The Space Museum.",981676800,16,3746,4.860062893081761

Except that there's been a drought and the people are hoping for the gods to save them. High Priest of Sacrifice Tlotoxl is ready to perform a human sacrifice (a common thing in Aztec culture) to bring back the rain. The TARDIS lands inside a temple and companion Barbara (the school teacher whose expertise is history) is the first one out. She is mistaken for a reincarnation of their god Yetaxa. She not only thinks it will be good fun to be divine, she also plans to end the evil parts of Aztec culture so that when the Conquistadors do come, they won't wipe out the Aztec civilization.

The Doctor (who is mistaken for her servant) strongly objects to altering history, saying it is impossible. Barbara insists on trying, which arouses the suspicions of Tlotoxl. Another high priest, Autloc, is the High Priest of Knowledge and more willing to change their customs. Barbara is encouraged by his reaction but as the story goes on, it's clear that Autloc is the odd man out and Tlotoxl represents the views of most Aztecs. Since the TARDIS is stuck behind a one-way door in the temple, the Doctor and his companions can't just run away immediately, making their stay longer and more perilous than they would like.

The show is a fascinating look at and discussion of pre-Columbia Aztec culture. While clearly condemning the abominable evil that went on, the show walks a fine line in presenting the barbarity of the culture while showing that not every aspect of the culture was evil. The supporting characters (even the villains) are well-developed and understandable if not always sympathetic.

The show also benefits from the high production values. The sets and costumes look great and the actors all give fine performances. The bad guys don't chew the scenery and no rubber-suited aliens are on display. One or two fight sequences are slow and unexciting. The cliff-hangers for the four parts of the story all work well.
