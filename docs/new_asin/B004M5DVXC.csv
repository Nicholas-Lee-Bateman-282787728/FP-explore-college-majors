The actors are wooden and give their lines like they were in a middle school play.  Where did they get these stick figures?

I was so disappointed.  It could have been a really good movie other-wise.  Sigh.....

The plot for this movie is really good.  The Christian world view is really, really good.  The locations, sets, filming are all pretty good.  But, the acting is just soooo bad!  If whoever was in charge had used some kind of REAL actors...this might have been a good production.  However, he/she didn't and I just can't endorse this terribly acted flick.

Oh, yes....how can I make this review fun....hhmmmmm...let's see.. Oh!, I know.  If you do go and rent/buy this flick and you start it up and begin watching... you can have a contest to see who can watch the longest without groaning about the lack of acting skills from the ""actors"".  OR a contest to see who can watch the longest before leaving the room to go clean the bathroom or kitchen......",1319846400,,1059,4.618279569892473

The simple beauty of Christian faith, the profound truth of God's grace, make this movie shine. There are struggles - which will always a part of our human endeavor, but this movie demonstrates the kind of love that sees us through - both in human form, and in the form of God's mercy and salvation.

In particular, Joe and Lucy's walk through Paradise is a beautifully filmed sequence, with a great accompanying score, and great chemistry between the actors. That scene, within the context of the entire movie, felt wonderfully authentic.

Kudos to the cast and crew and producers of Journey to Paradise! I can't wait for what's next - just, please make it soon. We need much more entertainment like this!
