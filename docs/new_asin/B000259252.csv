8022413,5,B000259252,"What a great DVD. The topics were covered in a simple and clear manner. For the 'Newbie' this would be the perfect choice, it covers all the relevant Kayak Fishing tips and hints. The narration is clear and easily understandable. The quality is great and this DVD is by Kayak Fisherman for Kayak Fisherman...",1290470400,,308,4.722222222222222
8022414,5,B000259252,"Never tried kayak fishing, but I'm now ready to go. Exceptionally well done and comprehensive. Great narrator! I also bought a book on kayak fishing, but seeing the ""real deal"" on video is much more stimulating.",1240876800,,211,4.888888888888889
8022415,4,B000259252,This is a good video for anyone new to kayak fishing and probably has some new tips for moderarely experienced fisherman. It strikes a good balance between safety information and fishning techniques.,1234483200,,199,5.25
8022416,4,B000259252,"This is a well done video. I think there could have been more information on rigging and working with different kayak configurations, but the info given is valuable.

I think there could have more time spent on interepting fish finder readings, and less time on ""how to catch bait"". Maybe a little more time reviewing the pros and cons of the various baitholding types, ie: Live wells and bait tubes, instead of just praising the plano bait bucket.

A little more time on surf launches, and more importantly, landings would be useful. As would some detail regarding the applications of ""ball bouncing"", ""carolina rigging"", ""drop shotting"", correct time to use a ""reverse dropper loop"", ""fly lining"" and ""tossing irons"".

I've made a few suggestions as far as what I would like to have seen. I do realize this would have made the video a bit longer, or maybe a reason to make ""The Kayak Fishing Video Advanced"".

Overall this is a very good video to get, even if you only watch it in the colder months. The quality of the audio/video is very good, and the only reason I didn't give a 5 was because a 5 would have been perfection.

You have to hand it to Spike, that man is living a life most of us can only hope for.",1171584000,5,1215,4.479638009049774
8022417,1,B000259252,"I am very disappointed in this DVD.  I did not see anything in the advertisement that said it was salt water  reel fishing only.  I was specifically looking for a general DVD on flyfishing and kayaking.

Naturally, I can't return it under Amazon policy.  Shame on you Amazon for false advertising.",1154649600,7,297,4.745098039215686
8022418,4,B000259252,"It's a good starter film, They could have spent more time on kayak handeling going in and out of surf with fishing gear but overall it was a great movie.",1141257600,2,153,4.133333333333334
8022419,5,B000259252,Mr. Spikes DVD was great! I was amazed at the amount of information crammed into this DVD. It offers a little something about ever aspect of Kayak fishing.,1137801600,3,155,4.571428571428571
8022420,5,B000259252,"Dennis Spike's Kayak Fishing Video gives the entering kayakfisherman a valuable set of nuts and bolts to put together their own entry into the sport of kayak fishing. Great ""hands on"" demonstration and basic instruction of how to get out there and do it, especially in the surf.",1095379200,8,278,4.8125
8022421,5,B000259252,"Dennis Spike has created an excellent resource for kayak fishing in ""The Kayak Fishing Video."" It is well produced with on-water and under-water photography, close up detail shots, and descriptive footage of basic techniques.

Dennis has a clear delivery of simple instruction for the kayak angler. The tips and techniques offered here will start any new kayak fisher on their way and reinforce to those ""old salts"" things that they may have forgotten. In addition to the instruction there is exciting fish fighting video footage at the end, the desert, so to speak, of the hearty meal of info.

Dennis reminds the fisherman-turned-kayaker of kayak safety concerns, how to launch and land in surf and the self-rescue. Plenty of nuts & bolts info about fishing kayaks and outfitting with rod holders, installing hatches, sonar systems and other fish accessories is  very useful with close up shots of how to ""trick-out"" your fish yak.

Dennis covers kayak fishing topics, the how and why, starting with packing the kayak for fishing, then onto sea anchor deployment, sonar and compass use and anchoring with kelp anchors and bottom anchors.

The section on bait fishing was fascinating to me, and it looks fun. Bait bucket use and stowage was informative as well. Dennis shows several types of fishing rigs to use and offers tips on drift fishing and trolling.

If you are a kayak fisher-person or wish to be one than this DVD / video is a must have. Not only is it informative, it is also entertaining and inspiring. ""The Kayak Fishing Video"" is the perfect platform to jump off into the sport of yak fishing, and an additional resource for experienced kayak fishers.",1091923200,14,1667,4.914590747330961
