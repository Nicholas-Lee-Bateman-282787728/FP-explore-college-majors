8729169,3,B013XNW39Q,"A young couple marry and vow to love one another forever. At the wedding it is obvious that there is a girl who is madly in love with the groom and a guy who is madly in love with the bride. Over time infidelity offers itself up to each of the happily married partnersdo they bend, do they break, do they remain faithful? This early talkie offers stilted acting and a simplistic story. It also presents a viewpoint of male superiority all too common for the time period. Although this film is watchable, your time is better spent watching a better film.",1522454400,,553,4.431372549019608
