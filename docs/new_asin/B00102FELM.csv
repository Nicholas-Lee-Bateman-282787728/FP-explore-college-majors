3045174,5,B00102FELM,"I am completely speechless after watching this fantasitc dvd. I was blown away by this performance(especially Uli Roth's performance , which I thought stole the show, I won't ever bag on his singing ever again.) And it is always great to see Michael Schenker play with them as well. It is a shame that four tracks were omitted from the show (one being ""In Search of the Peace of Mind, from my favorite Scorps album ""Lonesome Crow""), but this dvd is definitly a keeper. This show will blow you off your feet.
And it's great to see them cover songs from  RCA days.",1203033600,,562,4.456310679611651
3045175,5,B00102FELM,"I've been collecting the body of work from SCORPIONS for the past 25 years and this particular DVD is my most valued item in my collection.  I don't care where it was imported from, (mine came from Germany), I'd rate it 7 stars, if I could.  You need to be a REAL 'fan' to appreciate how the current members of the band managed to collaborate on stage for this DVD, former & founding members of the band.  They put aside any and all differences and pride; Matthias shows grace and finesse when on stage, playing along with Uli Jon Roth.  The songs were selected by members of the fan club who were given a choice of 50 to choose from.  The songs that made this concert are truly a ""Journey through time.""  Some songs played have not been played in recent years (live) or at all, so it's a treat for them to pull out all the stops and return to their roots.  I feel, as usual, Klaus' voice is not mixed very well within the sound and that he's a little drowned out by such LOUD (but awesome riffs).  The photography angles are good but you can tell the footage was edited quite a bit by quick changes in the focus.  These are production issues, not quality of the content problems.  They're performances are MASTERFUL, full of renewed energy, and they all appear very happy on this ""Night to Remember.""  I had a sense of having gone to a live performance when it was over, it gave me the chills.  Even band historians, such as myself, saw new things and the thrills kept coming.  Buy one for yourself AND a friend, there's no doubt you're not the only one who will want this level of pure enjoyment.",1203033600,4,1598,4.322147651006712
3045176,4,B00102FELM,"I got mine from Amazon yesterday and even though Amazon listed it as NTSC, it was PAL.  It had a sticker that said ""import"" and said it was from Thailand on the back.  I was wondering if there is an NTSC version available.  If not, I will hold on to this even though it doesn't work with my television.  If anyone got the NTSC version, I would like to know where I could get it.",1202860800,4,378,4.0
3045177,5,B00102FELM,"I just finished watching the new Scorpions live @ Wacken 2006 DVD and was totally-totally blown away!!!  Great production, sound quality and camera work. The band and song selection was top notch and Klaus Meine's Vox are clear as a bell and stronger than ever!  I've seen them live 5 times over the last 25+ years and they've never EVER sounded or been better than this!!!  The only disappointment I have is that I really wish they had turned up the levels a little more on Uli Roth's songs and solos. ***Spend the dime because this is an absolute MUST for your DVD concert collection!  Trust me, you'll thank me for it!!!",1202860800,,623,4.535714285714286
3045178,5,B00102FELM,"There is a reason why the scorpions remain at the apex of rock music. From their inception in the 60's to present day they have continued to evolve and grow and consistantly put on concerts that are pure energy and fun.
 Yes they are older now and their original drummer and bassist are no longer with them but it hasn't stopped them from remaining the consumate professionals that they are. It hasn't stopped them from bringing forth great music and live shows that everyone can enjoy. Younger musicians coming up in the ranks should sit up and pay attention as these german rockers long ago mastered the secret of longevity in a dog eat dog profession.
 I've had the great pleasure of seeing the scorpions play live on several occasions and 13 years ago I also had the great fortune to spend an entire day with these kind gentleman. They love to share their music and they love and respect their fans.

3045180,4,B00102FELM,"This release has been available on Best Buys website for a few weeks.  Awesome it is, very powerful sounding and not overly polished sounding.  I was disappointed when I read in other reviews that some great songs have been omitted, but it is still a ""must have"" if you like those hard rock groups that were big in the 80's and beyond.  And if you're like me, anything with Michael Schenker is a ""must have.""",1202169600,2,408,4.413333333333333
3045181,5,B00102FELM,"A brilliant concert, beautifully filmed at the Wacken Music Festival in 2006, showcasing one of the world's truly best and enduring rock bands - SCORPIONS - ""A Night to Remember / A Journey Through Time"", with special guests: former guitarists - Uli Jon Roth & Michael Schenker, with an appearance by Tyson Schenker and former skin's man - Herman Rarebell.
The Scorpions 26 song set sizzles - Rudy and Matthias never have sounded better, their guitar playing absolutely brilliant!!! (Check out Rudy's yoga headstand during the ""Bolero"" encore - the man is truly ageless and his energy, inspiring to all. The rhythm section of Pawel Maciwoda (bass) & James Kottak (drums), a high powered engine moving the songs to new heights.
Klaus Meine, for this listener is one of the rock world's greatest singer/frontmen (warts and all here), a powerful presence anytime he sets foot on stage.
These guys continue to amaze and thankfully appear to NOT, be slowing down, their last three records: ""Unbreakable"", ""Scorpions - Acoustica"" (Live from Portugal) & ""Humanity - Hour I "", are right up there, with the best they've ever released!!!
As of January 2008, this DVD continues to be held up, release-wise, by lack of a proper U.S. distribution deal.
Reasons : UNKNOWN??? - bad management, or a lame record industry perhaps?! It has been released in Europe & Asia (most of the world for that matter)and is available at Amazon UK, France and Germany, but that only helps those here in the States, with Euro-Zone (Zone 2) DVD players.
RECENTLY HOWEVER, it's been released in Canada and available at Amazon Canada and that edition will play in U.S. DVD players. It costs abit more, the dollar not being what is once was (We all know who to blame for that) but is a must have for all Scorps fans! I am loving my copy, with delivery time to the States being pretty fast. Enjoy this one folks, it's a keeper!
Rock On!",1201046400,15,1900,4.760606060606061
3045182,4,B00102FELM,"This was a great set and feast for Scorpions fans, featuring all their guitarists joining them throughout the night, but after seeing the track list compared to the original webcast, a big star deduction because four songs have been removed: ""Dark Lady,"" an absolute classic from the Roth era which was in the set between ""Speedy's Coming"" and ""We'll Burn the Sky,"" and three tracks performed during the encores: ""He's a Woman, She's a Man"" (with both Roth and Michael Schenker), ""In Search of the Piece of Mind"" (with Roth, M. Schenker and Michael's son Tyson Schenker, and the only track from the Lonesome Crow days) and ""Dynamite,"" a killer live number which was the 2nd encore before they came out a final time for ""Rock You Like a Hurricane."" The video does list ""Bolero"" in the place where ""In Search of the Piece of Mind"" was in the set. Maybe it was an intro to the song.

If anyone has any official reason for the removal of these, please share! I doubt it was due to lack of space, but if it was, a few of the lesser-known tracks like ""Love 'em or Leave 'em"" or ""Don't Believe Her""--not to mention the drum solo--could have been dropped in favor of these omitted Scorps classics.",1200268800,11,1189,4.530232558139535

Read what the band has to say about this magic night at wacken (2006)

SCORPIONS:
Wacken 2006 -- this was a very special concert for us, exciting and challenging and
-- most important of all -- a family reunion.
We wanted our fans to participate, so in summer 2006 we put a set of 50 songs on our homepage for the community to vote. Many of the songs chosen we had on our setlist anyway, but there were also many surprises.
Together with Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth and Herman Rarebell this show at Wacken gave us a great platform to journey through time -- 35 years of SCORPIONS history!
""A Night to remember"" it was indeed, a night to remember with an audience of 60.000 die hard metal fans who celebrated with us that the SCORPIONS got the sting and rock you like a Hurricane!
Thanks to everybody... Enjoy the Show!

Even when it sort of is, he's not playing scales in the right key of the song! WTF??? The songs he's on sound like s***e and that's a shame...a missed opportunity for old fans like myself.

If not maybe better! Loads of thier best music! What more could you ask for? And one more thing I loved about it was, No Cussing! Seems to me some bands could learn from the Scorpion's.

I've been a long time Scorpions fan since I was a teen in the 80's, so of course all my favorites from the Scorpions were in the 80's and early 90's. This concert DVD was a treat to hear all the classics of that era! And Klause can still belt it out! I'm not sure about the fuss on production of this DVD. The picture was great, clear picture in widescreen and excellent sound, although I preferred PCM stereo over 5.1 surround here cause the guitars are heard better in PCM stereo. Yes, the filming has that MTV vibe but not as bad as most concert DVD's (like Evanescence ""Anywhere But Home""). So this is a 5 star concert DVD of one of the biggest 80's hair metal bands still going strong with a running time of 2 hours and 19 minutes!",1382918400,,822,4.2756410256410255
3045215,5,B00102FELM,"These guys just plain out rock and this dvd, is great, puts you right there in the middle of all of it and makes you want to get your guitar, real or air, out and start playing along and throwing shapes. Buy this, turn it up, and just let it all go. Scorpians are a good time whether you are at home or in the middle of the crowd, actually there!",1381795200,,346,3.887323943661972

3045217,2,B00102FELM,"Sorry Scorpions and Scorpion fans. The drummer is over-the-top, horribly talented. The drum solo is the only part of this DVD that should've been cutout. It's not worth listening and watching. 3 classic Scorpions songs didn't make it to this: In Search Of The Piece Of Mind, He's a Woman She's a Man, Dynamite. But it includes ""Bolero"" and the lame drum solo. SImply horrible. And to make it worse, the song ""Holiday"" continues to be mangled. Seems like the Scorpions rarely play this song LIVE, all the way through, as it was written. And please Klaus... this is YOUR BAND; quit trying to get the audience to sing for you. It didn't work in this show. On the production aspect, all the comments are correct: too many scene-cuts. This was seriously OVER-EDITED. This package also should've included AUDIO CD's. Still glad I got it. I'd recommend it but be warned hardcore fans. It's disappointing but work a view (and ripping most songs), minus that drum solo. Glad to see this featured a lot of older stuff (I'm NOT a fan of anything after Blackout).",1366588800,,1051,4.686486486486486

He's A Woman, She's A Man - In Search Of The Peace Of Mind and Dynamite.  Why?  The odd thing is the whole show was broadcast, and so you can get soundboard recordings of the whole show including those songs online.  So why were they left out the DVD?",1360454400,,388,4.422535211267606

3045221,4,B00102FELM,"What a great set list/concert.

I do agree with everyone about the multiple camera angles.  It makes no sense.

If you want to see a great Heavy Metal Concert.....I would highly recommend the new CD release of Judas Priest's Screaming Vengeance.  It includes their 1983 show at US Festival on DVD.  Awesome!",1354838400,,307,4.826923076923077

3045224,5,B00102FELM,"Well, I must say that this is one of the best live DVDS that I've seen in a while!! Great to hear the hit songs, but also good to hear some that aren't played that often. I enjoyed seeing Michael Schenker and Uli Jon Roth jam with them!!",1327017600,,237,3.9583333333333335
3045225,4,B00102FELM,"Yes, this DVD has been out a long time, and yes, I just got it as I continue to round out my concert DVD/Blu-Ray library.  Not sure why it took me so long to order this (I LOVE the Scorps!), but it may have to do with the fact that they have several concert DVDs.  I struggled with which one to get.  Finally settled on Wacken AND Acoustica (complementary shows), and I am not disappointed.  Wacken is incredibly well-performed, as the guys do seem to be enjoying themselves.  For volume of songs itself, this is a great collection.  But, the song choices are great, too, spanning a broad range of years as they should.

I am with other reviewers, however, in disliking the frenetic camera angle switching.  It's cool to have tons of angles, but focus longer than 2 seconds on each shot, please!  It almost gives me motion sickness (not really!).  One last visual gripe is the overall darkness of the stage.  Not sure if this was the show or how it was filmed or edited, but it's just really dark except the sharp spotlights.  Not a big deal at all, but seems like it's unintended.  The audio is great except the bass is really pumping compared to other concerts I have.  No big deal, I just back off on the subwoofer a touch.

All in all, very happy and wishing I would have bought this years ago!",1314835200,,1298,4.372384937238493

3045229,4,B00102FELM,"Overall great concert.  Klaus' vocals seem a little week here and there, but for how long these guys have been around, they still do great live.  One of the few beefs I have with this is what's with the guy near the end randomly standing on his head, and just leisurely doing some yoga.  It really doesn't add to the concert, I'm just wondering ""Why is he doing that?"".  But that aside, it was great!",1277510400,,400,4.293333333333333

3045231,5,B00102FELM,"The first Scorpions release I ever bought was the Album - Fly To the Rainbow, and I've been hooked ever since Then I bought the 8-track version of Tokyo Tapes, and it completely blew me away. Ulrich Roth {as he was known then}, put on a guitar clinic as fas as live shows go. My favorites were Backstage Queen and Pictured Life. I was sad to see him leave the band after that magnificent performance.

Fast forward 17 years, and I took my 12 year old daughter to see her first 'Rock' concert; Scorpions and Mister Big at Irvine Meadows Ampitheatre, during the Crazy World tour, which Klaus said was being recorded. To say the least, she was blown away by them as well.

Now here it is 20 years later, and I purchased Live at Wacken. I am totally impressed by the show, especially seeing Uli John Roth, Michael Schenker, and Herman Rarebell being invited to play with them. It was a very good mix of old and new tunes. I was happy to see them play Speedy's Coming, Pictured Life, and In Trance. It gave Uli a chance to shine. And a particular great feature was when they played Ravel's Bolero, and Rudy got to do his head stand. The look on Matthias and Michael's faces when Uli kicked out the song was worth the price of admission. Matthias, Rudolph, and Pawel really were tight on every tune. This band seems ageless! And the energy that Rudy shows is what I believe has kept them going all these years. And it doesn't hurt having a front man like Klaus! This show was well worth the money I put down for it.

I am hoping that when they finally come to the US, they do a show here in Arizona, and maybe invite the old guys along. I'm thinking of taking my daughter and 12 year old grand-daughter when I go. Keep on rocking guys.",1270684800,4,1729,4.2975460122699385

3045234,4,B00102FELM,I bought this along with their Gold 2CD set and found Live at Wacken Open Air a little off with the sound. It could have been the placement of the microphones when it was recorded. But if you love the Scorpions you'll still enjoy this DVD.,1260057600,,239,4.217391304347826

Michael is a little tame, but it is always great to see him join his brother. I highly recommend this DVD to hardcore Scorpions fans, specially if you've been listening to these guys since the late 70's. Rudy and Mathias look good and sound great, and of course the man behind the microphone...Klaus Meine still has a great voice.",1257292800,,497,4.724137931034483
3045236,5,B00102FELM,"One of the longest running acts in heavy metal, the Scorpions, celebrate both their long history, and some of their most beloved past members, in this 2006 performance at the famed Wacken outdoor arena in Hamburg, Germany.  Billed as `A Night to Remember, A Journey Through Time', the 138 minute performance features guest appearances by past members Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker and Herman Rarebell.  The set list was partially based on input from the fans, and features many of the classics, with a few surprise selections.

The departure of Ulrich Roth in 1978, was a turning point in the band's history, and under the creative direction of singer Klaus Meine, and guitarist Rudolf Schenker, and with the contributions of Mathias Jabs on lead guitar, Scorpions found commercial success in the 80's.  Given the past, the presence of Roth is one of the highlights of the evening.  The Scorpions open the show alone, and then bring Roth onstage for `Pictured Life'.  `Speedy's Coming' takes you back to Roth's earliest times, and he really cuts loose on `We'll Burn the Sky'.  The sound of Roth's Sky guitar is at times rather thin, and isn't always well heard.  The sound mix is good but not great.  At times, the highs don't seem to cut through like they should, and Klaus's vocals are sometimes drowned out.

Roth departs, and after a few more songs, Michael Schenker is brought on, doing a very slowed down version of Coast to Coast, where Klaus also joins in on guitar.  Big brother Rudolf shows off his skills on an acoustic flying V, on a very resonant version of Holiday, where the guitars really are heard.  The editing style that is characterized by cuts every few seconds, gets annoying after a while.  Although the presentation includes a wide variety of views, the video is often not that sharp.  Again good, but not great.  Lovedrive, and Another Piece of Meat finishes Michael's featured portion of the show, during which, due to the editing, he really isn't seen very much.  When the guitar player isn't given appropriate screen time when soloing, there's an issue.

It's very cool to see Herman Rarebell join the band to play drums on Blackout and No One Like You.  For Blackout, Rudolph dons a mask with forks in the eyes, like the Blackout album cover, and plays a guitar that emits smoke through exhaust pipes.  Give the man some credit for showmanship, as the rest of the band is doesn't do too much to spice things up.

Matthias Jabs, solid throughout the performance, with his signature screams, squeaks, and squeals, then takes the stage for a short guitar solo, before taking the band into `Big City Nights'.  Rudolph's classic guitar solo is lost in the editing.  `Still Loving You' is almost magical when performed live, with more emotion from Rudolph's guitar in the outro.

Uli, Michael, and Herman all return for two more numbers.  `In Trance', is an another journey way, way back, and features some impressive work by Roth and Jabs.  Probably the most curious number is `Bolero', which not only features lots of Uli's guitar, but also Rudolf performing a headstand onstage.  The performance winds up with the appearance on a mechanical scorpion on stage, followed by a rousing version of `Rock You Like a Hurricane'.

The special guests, and songs from the 70's and 80's, are excellent reasons to check out this performance.  The choppy editing detracts from the enjoyment, and the sound mix could have been better at times, but the performance is still well worth seeing, as the Scorpions are very much in synch, playing for over two hours.  Klaus Meine's voice is still one of the finest, and the evening is a marvelous journey through the band's long history.",1246060800,,3695,4.82063492063492
3045237,4,B00102FELM,"I bought this DVD because it features a few songs with Uli Roth performing again with the Scorpions. I wasn't let down, though Uli could have been up in the mix a little more and it would have been nice to see him perform on more of the songs. His playing is as awesome as ever. It was also nice to see Herman Rarebell return to play drums on three songs. My biggest disappointment was the songs that added Michael Schenker back into the mix. He kinda butchered 'Coast To Coast"" and his playing on the other songs that featured him was pretty lack luster. This bummed me out because I'm also a huge Michael Schenker fan. Klaus Meine, Rudolph Schenker and Matthias Jabs all deliver solid performances, as they usually do. All in all it is a must have for all diehard Uli-era Scorpions fans.",1239580800,,789,4.410958904109589

3045239,5,B00102FELM,"First of all,I can't stop listening to this DVD!
I love live shows DVDs and I have quite a few of them in my DVD library. Scorpions Live at Wacken is probably one one the best live DVDs I came across in awhile. The song selection is great ,26 of them with special appearance of Herman Rarebell,Uli Jon Roth and Michael Schenker.

First thing you notice about this DVD is great sound;heavy and hard ,just as it should be. The next thing is that the band is really tight and every song is performed well.
It seems that Scorpions really benefit here from having younger guns James Kottak and Pawel Maciwoda,delivering rhytm section while original  masters Rudolph Schenker ,Mathhias Jabs and Klaus Meine deliver their magic.
The performance of opening 3 tracks Coming Home,Bad boys Running wild and The Zoo are best live recording of these 3 tracks ever and are worth buying this DVD for.
The rest of DVD spreads nicely in their earlier and later work with speacial appearance of the above mentioned musicians.
Every member of Scorpions shines on this DVD and thats a nice break from other live DVDs in my library.

I listen to many different styles of music,and have attended many different music genre concerts but Scorpions concert which I attended two years ago was probably one of the best hard rock concerts I have seen! Do yourself a favour and go see them next time they come to your town,you will be happy you did!",1238803200,,1420,4.626984126984127
3045240,4,B00102FELM,"I thought the DVD was great from a song list and line-up standpoint. The Uli Roth era songs (with Uli) were great as well as seeing the brothers Schenker playing together.

I agree with other reviewers - the way the DVD was shot was very 80's MTV (I guess its no coincidence since the Scorps were the biggest in the 80s). Too much jumping around from band member to band member without focusing on the guest axe men.

I give the DVD a 4 out of 5 rating.",1231459200,,453,4.136363636363637

THESE GUYS ARE FROM GERMANY (THIS DVD WAS FILMED IN HAMBURG, GERMANY), AND THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN ROCKING SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S. THIS BAND AND THIS CONCERT IS ""HARD ROCK"", AND ""METAL - GUITAR"" ROCK AT ITS VERY BEST!!!

THE SCORPIONS ARE Klaus Meine on vocals and guitar, Rudolf Schenker on guitar and backing vocals, matthias jabs on guitar, James Kottak on drums and Pawel Maciwoda on bass. Then you get guest musicians of Uli Jon Roth, and Michael Schenker and Herman Rarebell.

The concert consists of 26 songs, all performed extremely well. Note - this is high-powered rock and roll!!! High Energy rock from some old pro's.

Germany loves Southern Rock, both Molly Hatchet and Lynyrd Skynrd have recorded concert dvd's in Hamburg. And this ""Southern Rocker"" likes the Scorpions. I've been a fan for years, they are a good solid hard rock and roll band who put 100 percent Plus energy and effort into their performances. They are not vulgar, or evil or any of that kinda stuff, they are just a good ""wholesome"" hard rock band.

3045247,5,B00102FELM,"I bought this DVD through Amazon Canada almost one year ago because it was not yet released to the USA.  Although there are no special features on this DVD the show itself was remarkable.  The setlist was chosen by a vote of fans on the Scorpions website.  I've been a Scorps fan since about 1982 and have seen them live 10 times since 1987.  They are one of the best live rock bands in the world and they still play shows all around the globe throughout the year.

One of the great parts of this show was the addition of some songs I've never seen live and the collobaration with three former Scorps band members from long ago to play on stage.  The audio quality is good, I can turn it up loud and enjoy the vibrating of the entire house.  Although not top notch audio quality the previous live performance DVDs I've purchased by the Scorpions have all been less than adequate in that regard.

The show was shot at the Wacken Open Air Festival, a long-running four day heavy metal festival in northern Germany, about two hours from the Scorpions original hometown of Hannover.  The Scorpions entertained the crowd of 60,000 people as the headliner of the opening night of the festival.  Most European rock crowds that I've seen on video lack the enthusiasm of their United States brethren but this crowd was good, of course they were heavy metal fans just looking for a reason to mosh.  :)

Excellent concert performance, very good video and audio quality.  A Scorpions fan must have for the collection and a GREAT way to introduce young people to the musical performance these guys offer nightly around the world!  Long Live Scorpions!",1219968000,,1638,4.603448275862069

The music is fantastic, but as is written on other reviews, the production is amateur.  The camera changes every 3-4 seconds so you never get to focus on anything.  That would have been a cool effect every so often but not through the whole thing.  The sound is not so great in places.  On Coast to Coast, you can barely hear the lead guitar in places which is what makes that song so great, especially for a simple instrumental.

I wish they could take their footage and soundtrack and remix it better.  This could have / should have been a much higher quality production.

The music sounds great, and the huge crowd of 60,000 German fans are in high spirit throughout the performance. As an added bonus, there are guest appearances by Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker, Herman Rarebell, and Tyson Schenker. The show rolls on for over two hours, as the band performs a gigantic playlist of songs that span three decades of Scorpions music. Believe me, this is a really great live show that you will want to watch again and again. I have been lucky enough to see the Scorpions play live in Rotterdam, Holland. It was a such a great show, and this new DVD brings back a lot of memories for me. The Scorpions are still Rocking, and doing it WELL!",1211932800,,858,4.40251572327044

My PAL formatted DVD played well. It skipped very quickly about 4 times but it didn't interfere with the entertainment value. Whoever cut this show up though, did a very poor job. Too many 3 second close ups and then going from scene to scene. Too many crowdshots also. All these great guitarists and their solos were so poorly put together by the producers. Bad job.

A couple things to add after owning this for a while:

1. Yes, the video editor should be shot...
2. The tunes are a bit rushed. The Scorp's have a bad habit of that...
3. The sound has that loud broadcast mastering sound to it, where everything is always loud. No dynamics...

After I have purchased and watched this DVD I realized why the title of the DVD is chosen to be ""A Night to Remember"".  I imagine that for everyone that was on the audience for this concert, this was indeed a night to remember.  This concert took me back to the 80s when the Scorps were at their peak.  The concert is much similar to the ""World Wide Live"" recording in both the set list but also the band's performance.  It is admirable to see this band after almost 40 years on stage, still having such power, and such freshness in their performance.  I believe that the fact that James and Pavel brought the new blood into the band contributed to this.  Rudi and Mat are at their best, while Klaus's voice that was not very strong in the beginning of the concert, warmed up fast enough to deliver the great performance.  What to say about the guest, but simply outstanding.  Roth's playing took us back to the 70s and ""Tokyo Tapes recording"".  We were all nostalgic to see and hear those great songs again.  The energy that the band showed on the stage of the Wacken Festival is simply amazing. There are not too many bands today that have capabilities of producing such energy throughout two hours of the concert.  Let's not forget, Scorps are not young anymore, they are one of the veterans of today's world rock scene.  The set list is outstanding.  Scorpions have played all of their best hits over the years.  This DVD is a must have not only for the true fans of the Scorpions, but it is also a must have for any fan of the good rock music.
The reason why I am not rating this product with all five starts is because there is no bonus material to it (I would hope to see at least an interview with all band members to include the guest).  Another reason for giving this product only 4 stars is that the DVD cover was very cheaply made and the booklet is already torn from the cover. But this is secondary.  The primary reason for what you are going to by this product is because of the concert.  And that is outstanding, purely 5 star performance.",1207699200,,2249,4.710997442455243

These guys still rock, better than ever!  It's great that they played all of the oldies.  The video and sound quality is excellent.  Klaus's voice is still very good.  James Kottak and Pawel are great, not to mention Rudolf and Matthias.  I love watching Rudolf, here's a great rythum player and is very funny onstage.

3045264,3,B00102FELM,"No arguing over the music here, it is absolutely great. However, I am sooo disappointed with the song selection on this DVD. If they had followed the concert tracklist this would have been the ultimate Scorpions document ever.

This is because the concert tracklist was the result of a vote by the fans on the Wacken website before the event. The fans themselves selected the best Scorpions songs ever. Unsurprisingly, almost all songs that were chosen came from the classic 70's and 80's period. And that is precisely the reason why so many people were eagerly awaiting this DVD, to see these classic songs performed with the original artists (i.e. including Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker, Hermann Rarebell).

So it is outrageous and unforgivable that several of the old classics performed that night, and that you cannot get anywhere on DVD with the original artists, (Dark Lady, He's a Woman, She's a Man, Dynamite, In Search of the Piece of Mind) were edited out!!! Instead, what they left in includes a drum solo, and some mediocre new songs that you can see on any Scorpions DVD....!

This is so disappointing. The music industry has a sad history of deliberately crippling best of's and live concerts so that no ""definitive"" release can ever see the light, but this is one of the most blatant examples ever! (And don't tell me it is because they had some kind of technical problem that they eliminated those songs, because (a) the audio stream of the concert that you can find on the web sounds fine and (b) they claim that it is precisely because of remastering that it took them over a year to release this, so they had plenty of opportunities to remedy any problem).

3045269,4,B00102FELM,"Well, after months of hearing about it, my most anticipated DVD of 2008 finally arrived and I have mixed feelings. From a performance standpoint, this is an AWESOME show featuring guest appearances by ex-Scorps Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth, and Herman Rarebell. The addition of these great musicians for a one-night reunion is a blessing for those of us who listened to the Scorpions long before Rock You Like a Hurricane took the mainstream rock world by storm in the early 80s. All musicians are at the top of their game, and enjoying themselves on this special night.

Unfortunately, as is often the case with DVDS these days, this suffers from the dreaded MTV-video style editing throughout, causing even non-epileptics to go into seizures after awhile. Special guest guitarists Roth and Schenker deserve more camera time during their brief appearances, but their amazing solos were caught only momentarily in the unyeilding flashing of images.

Camera shots changing every second is fine for a 4 minute video, but it gets really annoying on a concert that stretches over two hours. Someone needs to string these video editors up by the gonads and let them hang for a week on CNN Updates to get the point across. It virtually ruins my ability to just sit and watch the concert all the way through (unless I'm really drunk or multi-tasking).

I also have some issues with the audio. On my 5.1 computer system speakers, the volume is very low and I have to max out all  controls to get it to sound anywhere near a rock concert. Also, the bass end is lost in the mix and I had to really boost up both my EQ and subwoofer to get some PUNCH out of this show. When I did that, the bass guitar was just a rumbly drone.

In contrast, on my television's old-school tower speakers with a modern subwoofer, the over-all volume level is fine (probably because of the amplifier), but again the bass guitar is distorted when I tune the subwoofer to kick me with the drums. A legendary concert of this magnitude deserves a better mix in my opinion.

I do have to give the audio engineers credit on the 5.1 surround mix though, it is a fantastic use of the technology. Really cool stereo/front-rear effects, and they are featured throughout. Hearing it on my tv's stereo system just doesn't do it justice compared to the surround.

With the video/audio flaws setting this DVD at 3 stars, the nearly perfect musical performance brings it up to a solid 4 STARS and is still worthy of purchase for any long-time Scorpions fan. My recommendation: BUY IT!

It's probably the best Scorpions concert you'll ever get to see in your living room.",1204416000,63,2626,4.693478260869565

3045271,5,B00102FELM,"I haven't gotten my concert video of this great Scorpions concert yet...I WAS AT THE SHOW!!  Wacken, Germany 2006!!  The Open-Air Concert weekend was awesome.  The Scorpions 'family' event was the Thursday night of a three-night event.  Dead center, 30 body-widths from the barricade or so...I enjoyed the entire show.  The weather held and the Scorp's took the stage.  I've not yet seen the DVD of this concert though, so I'm counting on sound tech's and camera work to make it come to life.

I'd seen The Scorpions in the USA in the early years...on the ""Bad Boys Running Wild""-Tour with Iron Maiden as the opening act.  In Germany playing to their homeland the show is incredible.  Of note however, the band is getting older, Klaus has a few pitchy moments...the stage presence no longer harkens to crazy-rockers...although Rudolf and the boys do perform their trademark flying-guitars, pyramid, etc...

The Wacken Open-Air Event is a hard metal, annual 3-day event.  With a crowd of younger metal fans in attendance, ie. fans who didn't grow up with The Scorpions, in comparison with the rest of the Wacken Event, The Scorpions were considered a pop band.  So, the crowd was responsive, in admiration of the 'old rockers onstage' but reserved for the harder acts to follow.

If the technical aspects of the show don't disappoint you'll enjoy a classic performance!!  I know I clapped, sweated, cheered, and sang along to all the songs I grew up with.",1203897600,,1454,4.881632653061224

I have been saying that for 30 years now and this DVD proves it again. The band is awesome. And with guests Uli Jon Roth,Micheal Schenker, and Herman Rarebell this is truly a must have for any Scorpions fan. It was shot during the tour for the Unbreakable album,and the track list covers all era's of the band's extensive record catalog. From Speedy's Coming and Pictured Life to Love 'Em or Leave 'Em.

I was blown away by this performance(especially Uli Roth's performance , which I thought stole the show, I won't ever bag on his singing ever again.) And it is always great to see Michael Schenker play with them as well. It is a shame that four tracks were omitted from the show (one being ""In Search of the Peace of Mind, from my favorite Scorps album ""Lonesome Crow""), but this dvd is definitly a keeper. This show will blow you off your feet.

3279672,5,B00102FELM,"I've been collecting the body of work from SCORPIONS for the past 25 years and this particular DVD is my most valued item in my collection.  I don't care where it was imported from, (mine came from Germany), I'd rate it 7 stars, if I could.  You need to be a REAL 'fan' to appreciate how the current members of the band managed to collaborate on stage for this DVD, former & founding members of the band.  They put aside any and all differences and pride; Matthias shows grace and finesse when on stage, playing along with Uli Jon Roth.  The songs were selected by members of the fan club who were given a choice of 50 to choose from.  The songs that made this concert are truly a ""Journey through time.""  Some songs played have not been played in recent years (live) or at all, so it's a treat for them to pull out all the stops and return to their roots.  I feel, as usual, Klaus' voice is not mixed very well within the sound and that he's a little drowned out by such LOUD (but awesome riffs).  The photography angles are good but you can tell the footage was edited quite a bit by quick changes in the focus.  These are production issues, not quality of the content problems.  They're performances are MASTERFUL, full of renewed energy, and they all appear very happy on this ""Night to Remember.""  I had a sense of having gone to a live performance when it was over, it gave me the chills.  Even band historians, such as myself, saw new things and the thrills kept coming.  Buy one for yourself AND a friend, there's no doubt you're not the only one who will want this level of pure enjoyment.",1203033600,4,1598,4.322147651006712

I've seen them live 5 times over the last 25+ years and they've never EVER sounded or been better than this!!!

 Yes they are older now and their original drummer and bassist are no longer with them but it hasn't stopped them from remaining the consumate professionals that they are. It hasn't stopped them from bringing forth great music and live shows that everyone can enjoy. Younger musicians coming up in the ranks should sit up and pay attention as these german rockers long ago mastered the secret of longevity in a dog eat dog profession.
 I've had the great pleasure of seeing the scorpions play live on several occasions and 13 years ago I also had the great fortune to spend an entire day with these kind gentleman. They love to share their music and they love and respect their fans.

The Scorpions 26 song set sizzles - Rudy and Matthias never have sounded better, their guitar playing absolutely brilliant!!! (Check out Rudy's yoga headstand during the ""Bolero"" encore - the man is truly ageless and his energy, inspiring to all. The rhythm section of Pawel Maciwoda (bass) & James Kottak (drums), a high powered engine moving the songs to new heights.
Klaus Meine, for this listener is one of the rock world's greatest singer/frontmen (warts and all here), a powerful presence anytime he sets foot on stage.
These guys continue to amaze and thankfully appear to NOT, be slowing down, their last three records: ""Unbreakable"", ""Scorpions - Acoustica"" (Live from Portugal) & ""Humanity - Hour I "", are right up there, with the best they've ever released!!!
As of January 2008, this DVD continues to be held up, release-wise, by lack of a proper U.S. distribution deal.
Reasons : UNKNOWN??? - bad management, or a lame record industry perhaps?! It has been released in Europe & Asia (most of the world for that matter)and is available at Amazon UK, France and Germany, but that only helps those here in the States, with Euro-Zone (Zone 2) DVD players.
RECENTLY HOWEVER, it's been released in Canada and available at Amazon Canada and that edition will play in U.S. DVD players. It costs abit more, the dollar not being what is once was (We all know who to blame for that) but is a must have for all Scorps fans!

3279679,4,B00102FELM,"This was a great set and feast for Scorpions fans, featuring all their guitarists joining them throughout the night, but after seeing the track list compared to the original webcast, a big star deduction because four songs have been removed: ""Dark Lady,"" an absolute classic from the Roth era which was in the set between ""Speedy's Coming"" and ""We'll Burn the Sky,"" and three tracks performed during the encores: ""He's a Woman, She's a Man"" (with both Roth and Michael Schenker), ""In Search of the Piece of Mind"" (with Roth, M. Schenker and Michael's son Tyson Schenker, and the only track from the Lonesome Crow days) and ""Dynamite,"" a killer live number which was the 2nd encore before they came out a final time for ""Rock You Like a Hurricane."" The video does list ""Bolero"" in the place where ""In Search of the Piece of Mind"" was in the set. Maybe it was an intro to the song.

If anyone has any official reason for the removal of these, please share! I doubt it was due to lack of space, but if it was, a few of the lesser-known tracks like ""Love 'em or Leave 'em"" or ""Don't Believe Her""--not to mention the drum solo--could have been dropped in favor of these omitted Scorps classics.",1200268800,11,1189,4.530232558139535

Read what the band has to say about this magic night at wacken (2006)

SCORPIONS:
Wacken 2006 -- this was a very special concert for us, exciting and challenging and
-- most important of all -- a family reunion.
We wanted our fans to participate, so in summer 2006 we put a set of 50 songs on our homepage for the community to vote. Many of the songs chosen we had on our setlist anyway, but there were also many surprises.
Together with Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth and Herman Rarebell this show at Wacken gave us a great platform to journey through time -- 35 years of SCORPIONS history!
""A Night to remember"" it was indeed, a night to remember with an audience of 60.000 die hard metal fans who celebrated with us that the SCORPIONS got the sting and rock you like a Hurricane!
Thanks to everybody... Enjoy the Show!

This concert DVD was a treat to hear all the classics of that era! And Klause can still belt it out! I'm not sure about the fuss on production of this DVD. The picture was great, clear picture in widescreen and excellent sound, although I preferred PCM stereo over 5.1 surround here cause the guitars are heard better in PCM stereo. Yes, the filming has that MTV vibe but not as bad as most concert DVD's (like Evanescence ""Anywhere But Home"").

It's not worth listening and watching. 3 classic Scorpions songs didn't make it to this: In Search Of The Piece Of Mind, He's a Woman She's a Man, Dynamite. But it includes ""Bolero"" and the lame drum solo. SImply horrible. And to make it worse, the song ""Holiday"" continues to be mangled. Seems like the Scorpions rarely play this song LIVE, all the way through, as it was written. And please Klaus... this is YOUR BAND; quit trying to get the audience to sing for you. It didn't work in this show. On the production aspect, all the comments are correct: too many scene-cuts. This was seriously OVER-EDITED. This package also should've included AUDIO CD's. Still glad I got it. I'd recommend it but be warned hardcore fans. It's disappointing but work a view (and ripping most songs), minus that drum solo.

3279722,4,B00102FELM,"Yes, this DVD has been out a long time, and yes, I just got it as I continue to round out my concert DVD/Blu-Ray library.  Not sure why it took me so long to order this (I LOVE the Scorps!), but it may have to do with the fact that they have several concert DVDs.  I struggled with which one to get.  Finally settled on Wacken AND Acoustica (complementary shows), and I am not disappointed.  Wacken is incredibly well-performed, as the guys do seem to be enjoying themselves.  For volume of songs itself, this is a great collection.  But, the song choices are great, too, spanning a broad range of years as they should.

I am with other reviewers, however, in disliking the frenetic camera angle switching.  It's cool to have tons of angles, but focus longer than 2 seconds on each shot, please!  It almost gives me motion sickness (not really!).  One last visual gripe is the overall darkness of the stage.  Not sure if this was the show or how it was filmed or edited, but it's just really dark except the sharp spotlights.  Not a big deal at all, but seems like it's unintended.  The audio is great except the bass is really pumping compared to other concerts I have.  No big deal, I just back off on the subwoofer a touch.

All in all, very happy and wishing I would have bought this years ago!",1314835200,,1298,4.372384937238493

One of the few beefs I have with this is what's with the guy near the end randomly standing on his head, and just leisurely doing some yoga.  It really doesn't add to the concert, I'm just wondering ""Why is he doing that?"".  But that aside, it was great!",1277510400,,400,4.293333333333333

3279728,5,B00102FELM,"The first Scorpions release I ever bought was the Album - Fly To the Rainbow, and I've been hooked ever since Then I bought the 8-track version of Tokyo Tapes, and it completely blew me away. Ulrich Roth {as he was known then}, put on a guitar clinic as fas as live shows go. My favorites were Backstage Queen and Pictured Life. I was sad to see him leave the band after that magnificent performance.

Fast forward 17 years, and I took my 12 year old daughter to see her first 'Rock' concert; Scorpions and Mister Big at Irvine Meadows Ampitheatre, during the Crazy World tour, which Klaus said was being recorded. To say the least, she was blown away by them as well.

Now here it is 20 years later, and I purchased Live at Wacken. I am totally impressed by the show, especially seeing Uli John Roth, Michael Schenker, and Herman Rarebell being invited to play with them. It was a very good mix of old and new tunes. I was happy to see them play Speedy's Coming, Pictured Life, and In Trance. It gave Uli a chance to shine. And a particular great feature was when they played Ravel's Bolero, and Rudy got to do his head stand. The look on Matthias and Michael's faces when Uli kicked out the song was worth the price of admission. Matthias, Rudolph, and Pawel really were tight on every tune. This band seems ageless! And the energy that Rudy shows is what I believe has kept them going all these years. And it doesn't hurt having a front man like Klaus! This show was well worth the money I put down for it.

I am hoping that when they finally come to the US, they do a show here in Arizona, and maybe invite the old guys along. I'm thinking of taking my daughter and 12 year old grand-daughter when I go. Keep on rocking guys.",1270684800,4,1729,4.2975460122699385

Michael is a little tame, but it is always great to see him join his brother. I highly recommend this DVD to hardcore Scorpions fans, specially if you've been listening to these guys since the late 70's.

3279733,5,B00102FELM,"One of the longest running acts in heavy metal, the Scorpions, celebrate both their long history, and some of their most beloved past members, in this 2006 performance at the famed Wacken outdoor arena in Hamburg, Germany.  Billed as `A Night to Remember, A Journey Through Time', the 138 minute performance features guest appearances by past members Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker and Herman Rarebell.  The set list was partially based on input from the fans, and features many of the classics, with a few surprise selections.

The departure of Ulrich Roth in 1978, was a turning point in the band's history, and under the creative direction of singer Klaus Meine, and guitarist Rudolf Schenker, and with the contributions of Mathias Jabs on lead guitar, Scorpions found commercial success in the 80's.  Given the past, the presence of Roth is one of the highlights of the evening.  The Scorpions open the show alone, and then bring Roth onstage for `Pictured Life'.  `Speedy's Coming' takes you back to Roth's earliest times, and he really cuts loose on `We'll Burn the Sky'.  The sound of Roth's Sky guitar is at times rather thin, and isn't always well heard.  The sound mix is good but not great.  At times, the highs don't seem to cut through like they should, and Klaus's vocals are sometimes drowned out.

Roth departs, and after a few more songs, Michael Schenker is brought on, doing a very slowed down version of Coast to Coast, where Klaus also joins in on guitar.  Big brother Rudolf shows off his skills on an acoustic flying V, on a very resonant version of Holiday, where the guitars really are heard.  The editing style that is characterized by cuts every few seconds, gets annoying after a while.  Although the presentation includes a wide variety of views, the video is often not that sharp.  Again good, but not great.  Lovedrive, and Another Piece of Meat finishes Michael's featured portion of the show, during which, due to the editing, he really isn't seen very much.  When the guitar player isn't given appropriate screen time when soloing, there's an issue.

It's very cool to see Herman Rarebell join the band to play drums on Blackout and No One Like You.  For Blackout, Rudolph dons a mask with forks in the eyes, like the Blackout album cover, and plays a guitar that emits smoke through exhaust pipes.  Give the man some credit for showmanship, as the rest of the band is doesn't do too much to spice things up.

Matthias Jabs, solid throughout the performance, with his signature screams, squeaks, and squeals, then takes the stage for a short guitar solo, before taking the band into `Big City Nights'.  Rudolph's classic guitar solo is lost in the editing.  `Still Loving You' is almost magical when performed live, with more emotion from Rudolph's guitar in the outro.

Uli, Michael, and Herman all return for two more numbers.  `In Trance', is an another journey way, way back, and features some impressive work by Roth and Jabs.  Probably the most curious number is `Bolero', which not only features lots of Uli's guitar, but also Rudolf performing a headstand onstage.  The performance winds up with the appearance on a mechanical scorpion on stage, followed by a rousing version of `Rock You Like a Hurricane'.

The special guests, and songs from the 70's and 80's, are excellent reasons to check out this performance.  The choppy editing detracts from the enjoyment, and the sound mix could have been better at times, but the performance is still well worth seeing, as the Scorpions are very much in synch, playing for over two hours.  Klaus Meine's voice is still one of the finest, and the evening is a marvelous journey through the band's long history.",1246060800,,3695,4.82063492063492
3279734,4,B00102FELM,"I bought this DVD because it features a few songs with Uli Roth performing again with the Scorpions. I wasn't let down, though Uli could have been up in the mix a little more and it would have been nice to see him perform on more of the songs. His playing is as awesome as ever. It was also nice to see Herman Rarebell return to play drums on three songs. My biggest disappointment was the songs that added Michael Schenker back into the mix. He kinda butchered 'Coast To Coast"" and his playing on the other songs that featured him was pretty lack luster. This bummed me out because I'm also a huge Michael Schenker fan. Klaus Meine, Rudolph Schenker and Matthias Jabs all deliver solid performances, as they usually do. All in all it is a must have for all diehard Uli-era Scorpions fans.",1239580800,,789,4.410958904109589

3279736,5,B00102FELM,"First of all,I can't stop listening to this DVD!
I love live shows DVDs and I have quite a few of them in my DVD library. Scorpions Live at Wacken is probably one one the best live DVDs I came across in awhile. The song selection is great ,26 of them with special appearance of Herman Rarebell,Uli Jon Roth and Michael Schenker.

First thing you notice about this DVD is great sound;heavy and hard ,just as it should be. The next thing is that the band is really tight and every song is performed well.
It seems that Scorpions really benefit here from having younger guns James Kottak and Pawel Maciwoda,delivering rhytm section while original  masters Rudolph Schenker ,Mathhias Jabs and Klaus Meine deliver their magic.
The performance of opening 3 tracks Coming Home,Bad boys Running wild and The Zoo are best live recording of these 3 tracks ever and are worth buying this DVD for.
The rest of DVD spreads nicely in their earlier and later work with speacial appearance of the above mentioned musicians.
Every member of Scorpions shines on this DVD and thats a nice break from other live DVDs in my library.

I listen to many different styles of music,and have attended many different music genre concerts but Scorpions concert which I attended two years ago was probably one of the best hard rock concerts I have seen!

3279737,4,B00102FELM,"I thought the DVD was great from a song list and line-up standpoint. The Uli Roth era songs (with Uli) were great as well as seeing the brothers Schenker playing together.

I agree with other reviewers - the way the DVD was shot was very 80's MTV (I guess its no coincidence since the Scorps were the biggest in the 80s). Too much jumping around from band member to band member without focusing on the guest axe men.

THESE GUYS ARE FROM GERMANY (THIS DVD WAS FILMED IN HAMBURG, GERMANY), AND THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN ROCKING SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S. THIS BAND AND THIS CONCERT IS ""HARD ROCK"", AND ""METAL - GUITAR"" ROCK AT ITS VERY BEST!!!

THE SCORPIONS ARE Klaus Meine on vocals and guitar, Rudolf Schenker on guitar and backing vocals, matthias jabs on guitar, James Kottak on drums and Pawel Maciwoda on bass. Then you get guest musicians of Uli Jon Roth, and Michael Schenker and Herman Rarebell.

The concert consists of 26 songs, all performed extremely well. Note - this is high-powered rock and roll!!! High Energy rock from some old pro's.

Germany loves Southern Rock, both Molly Hatchet and Lynyrd Skynrd have recorded concert dvd's in Hamburg. And this ""Southern Rocker"" likes the Scorpions. I've been a fan for years, they are a good solid hard rock and roll band who put 100 percent Plus energy and effort into their performances. They are not vulgar, or evil or any of that kinda stuff, they are just a good ""wholesome"" hard rock band.

3279744,5,B00102FELM,"I bought this DVD through Amazon Canada almost one year ago because it was not yet released to the USA.  Although there are no special features on this DVD the show itself was remarkable.  The setlist was chosen by a vote of fans on the Scorpions website.  I've been a Scorps fan since about 1982 and have seen them live 10 times since 1987.  They are one of the best live rock bands in the world and they still play shows all around the globe throughout the year.

One of the great parts of this show was the addition of some songs I've never seen live and the collobaration with three former Scorps band members from long ago to play on stage.  The audio quality is good, I can turn it up loud and enjoy the vibrating of the entire house.  Although not top notch audio quality the previous live performance DVDs I've purchased by the Scorpions have all been less than adequate in that regard.

The show was shot at the Wacken Open Air Festival, a long-running four day heavy metal festival in northern Germany, about two hours from the Scorpions original hometown of Hannover.  The Scorpions entertained the crowd of 60,000 people as the headliner of the opening night of the festival.  Most European rock crowds that I've seen on video lack the enthusiasm of their United States brethren but this crowd was good, of course they were heavy metal fans just looking for a reason to mosh.  :)

Excellent concert performance, very good video and audio quality.  A Scorpions fan must have for the collection and a GREAT way to introduce young people to the musical performance these guys offer nightly around the world!  Long Live Scorpions!",1219968000,,1638,4.603448275862069

The music is fantastic, but as is written on other reviews, the production is amateur.  The camera changes every 3-4 seconds so you never get to focus on anything.  That would have been a cool effect every so often but not through the whole thing.  The sound is not so great in places.  On Coast to Coast, you can barely hear the lead guitar in places which is what makes that song so great, especially for a simple instrumental.

I wish they could take their footage and soundtrack and remix it better.  This could have / should have been a much higher quality production.

As an added bonus, there are guest appearances by Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker, Herman Rarebell, and Tyson Schenker. The show rolls on for over two hours, as the band performs a gigantic playlist of songs that span three decades of Scorpions music. Believe me, this is a really great live show that you will want to watch again and again. I have been lucky enough to see the Scorpions play live in Rotterdam, Holland.

My PAL formatted DVD played well. It skipped very quickly about 4 times but it didn't interfere with the entertainment value. Whoever cut this show up though, did a very poor job. Too many 3 second close ups and then going from scene to scene. Too many crowdshots also. All these great guitarists and their solos were so poorly put together by the producers. Bad job.

A couple things to add after owning this for a while:

1. Yes, the video editor should be shot...
2. The tunes are a bit rushed. The Scorp's have a bad habit of that...
3. The sound has that loud broadcast mastering sound to it, where everything is always loud. No dynamics...

After I have purchased and watched this DVD I realized why the title of the DVD is chosen to be ""A Night to Remember"".  I imagine that for everyone that was on the audience for this concert, this was indeed a night to remember.  This concert took me back to the 80s when the Scorps were at their peak.  The concert is much similar to the ""World Wide Live"" recording in both the set list but also the band's performance.  It is admirable to see this band after almost 40 years on stage, still having such power, and such freshness in their performance.  I believe that the fact that James and Pavel brought the new blood into the band contributed to this.  Rudi and Mat are at their best, while Klaus's voice that was not very strong in the beginning of the concert, warmed up fast enough to deliver the great performance.  What to say about the guest, but simply outstanding.  Roth's playing took us back to the 70s and ""Tokyo Tapes recording"".  We were all nostalgic to see and hear those great songs again.  The energy that the band showed on the stage of the Wacken Festival is simply amazing. There are not too many bands today that have capabilities of producing such energy throughout two hours of the concert.  Let's not forget, Scorps are not young anymore, they are one of the veterans of today's world rock scene.  The set list is outstanding.  Scorpions have played all of their best hits over the years.  This DVD is a must have not only for the true fans of the Scorpions, but it is also a must have for any fan of the good rock music.
The reason why I am not rating this product with all five starts is because there is no bonus material to it (I would hope to see at least an interview with all band members to include the guest).  Another reason for giving this product only 4 stars is that the DVD cover was very cheaply made and the booklet is already torn from the cover. But this is secondary.  The primary reason for what you are going to by this product is because of the concert.  And that is outstanding, purely 5 star performance.",1207699200,,2249,4.710997442455243

These guys still rock, better than ever!  It's great that they played all of the oldies.  The video and sound quality is excellent.  Klaus's voice is still very good.  James Kottak and Pawel are great, not to mention Rudolf and Matthias.  I love watching Rudolf, here's a great rythum player and is very funny onstage.  It's really cool to see Uli Roth, Michael Schenker, and Herman Rarebell too.  These guys are great!",1206230400,,766,4.438848920863309
3279761,3,B00102FELM,"No arguing over the music here, it is absolutely great. However, I am sooo disappointed with the song selection on this DVD. If they had followed the concert tracklist this would have been the ultimate Scorpions document ever.

This is because the concert tracklist was the result of a vote by the fans on the Wacken website before the event. The fans themselves selected the best Scorpions songs ever. Unsurprisingly, almost all songs that were chosen came from the classic 70's and 80's period. And that is precisely the reason why so many people were eagerly awaiting this DVD, to see these classic songs performed with the original artists (i.e. including Uli Jon Roth, Michael Schenker, Hermann Rarebell).

So it is outrageous and unforgivable that several of the old classics performed that night, and that you cannot get anywhere on DVD with the original artists, (Dark Lady, He's a Woman, She's a Man, Dynamite, In Search of the Piece of Mind) were edited out!!! Instead, what they left in includes a drum solo, and some mediocre new songs that you can see on any Scorpions DVD....!

This is so disappointing. The music industry has a sad history of deliberately crippling best of's and live concerts so that no ""definitive"" release can ever see the light, but this is one of the most blatant examples ever! (And don't tell me it is because they had some kind of technical problem that they eliminated those songs, because (a) the audio stream of the concert that you can find on the web sounds fine and (b) they claim that it is precisely because of remastering that it took them over a year to release this, so they had plenty of opportunities to remedy any problem). My advice: better wait until a proper version of this concert is released or circulated via p2p.",1205884800,27,1774,4.73462783171521
3279762,5,B00102FELM,"I'm a huge fan of the Scorpions, I've got just about everything they have put out, From LP's, CD's,VHS.S and more. And when I got this DVD Live at Wacken. It blew me away. Great stage performance like always I rate it the highest one DVD you have to get",1205798400,,253,4.08
3279763,1,B00102FELM,"Be careful. Had to return. Did not play on my DVD player or computer. The back cover said NTSC Region 0. However, the DVD said PAL Region 9. I could see the picture, but there was no sound. Wait for the US version!!",1205798400,,215,4.023255813953488

3279765,1,B00102FELM,I listened to all the reviews I read and let me tell you they are written by fanatics.  I love the Scorps.  The Scorps used to rock.  I wish I could return this concert video in little pieces.  The sound is junk the music is limp and the vocals are done. Don't waste you money on this video.  Sorry Scorps.  Your done..............,1204848000,,331,4.258064516129032
3279766,4,B00102FELM,"Well, after months of hearing about it, my most anticipated DVD of 2008 finally arrived and I have mixed feelings. From a performance standpoint, this is an AWESOME show featuring guest appearances by ex-Scorps Michael Schenker, Uli Jon Roth, and Herman Rarebell. The addition of these great musicians for a one-night reunion is a blessing for those of us who listened to the Scorpions long before Rock You Like a Hurricane took the mainstream rock world by storm in the early 80s. All musicians are at the top of their game, and enjoying themselves on this special night.

Unfortunately, as is often the case with DVDS these days, this suffers from the dreaded MTV-video style editing throughout, causing even non-epileptics to go into seizures after awhile. Special guest guitarists Roth and Schenker deserve more camera time during their brief appearances, but their amazing solos were caught only momentarily in the unyeilding flashing of images.

Camera shots changing every second is fine for a 4 minute video, but it gets really annoying on a concert that stretches over two hours. Someone needs to string these video editors up by the gonads and let them hang for a week on CNN Updates to get the point across. It virtually ruins my ability to just sit and watch the concert all the way through (unless I'm really drunk or multi-tasking).

I also have some issues with the audio. On my 5.1 computer system speakers, the volume is very low and I have to max out all  controls to get it to sound anywhere near a rock concert. Also, the bass end is lost in the mix and I had to really boost up both my EQ and subwoofer to get some PUNCH out of this show. When I did that, the bass guitar was just a rumbly drone.

In contrast, on my television's old-school tower speakers with a modern subwoofer, the over-all volume level is fine (probably because of the amplifier), but again the bass guitar is distorted when I tune the subwoofer to kick me with the drums. A legendary concert of this magnitude deserves a better mix in my opinion.

I do have to give the audio engineers credit on the 5.1 surround mix though, it is a fantastic use of the technology. Really cool stereo/front-rear effects, and they are featured throughout. Hearing it on my tv's stereo system just doesn't do it justice compared to the surround.

With the video/audio flaws setting this DVD at 3 stars, the nearly perfect musical performance brings it up to a solid 4 STARS and is still worthy of purchase for any long-time Scorpions fan. My recommendation: BUY IT!

It's probably the best Scorpions concert you'll ever get to see in your living room.",1204416000,63,2626,4.693478260869565
3279767,5,B00102FELM,"Amazing performance captured live, what else could we expect by the Scorps ? a friends reunion, nice watching former band's members of the 70's  and 80's line up, the playlist is more than 80 percent of the World Wide Live CD,  a good oportunity to listen and whatch  old hits from the peak era of scorpions in the 80's,  the sound is great as well as the cameras work , over 60.000 fans screaming at waken, no doubts at all five stars for this DVD.",1204156800,,449,4.247058823529412
3279768,5,B00102FELM,"I haven't gotten my concert video of this great Scorpions concert yet...I WAS AT THE SHOW!!  Wacken, Germany 2006!!  The Open-Air Concert weekend was awesome.  The Scorpions 'family' event was the Thursday night of a three-night event.  Dead center, 30 body-widths from the barricade or so...I enjoyed the entire show.  The weather held and the Scorp's took the stage.  I've not yet seen the DVD of this concert though, so I'm counting on sound tech's and camera work to make it come to life.

I'd seen The Scorpions in the USA in the early years...on the ""Bad Boys Running Wild""-Tour with Iron Maiden as the opening act.  In Germany playing to their homeland the show is incredible.  Of note however, the band is getting older, Klaus has a few pitchy moments...the stage presence no longer harkens to crazy-rockers...although Rudolf and the boys do perform their trademark flying-guitars, pyramid, etc...

The Wacken Open-Air Event is a hard metal, annual 3-day event.  With a crowd of younger metal fans in attendance, ie. fans who didn't grow up with The Scorpions, in comparison with the rest of the Wacken Event, The Scorpions were considered a pop band.  So, the crowd was responsive, in admiration of the 'old rockers onstage' but reserved for the harder acts to follow.

If the technical aspects of the show don't disappoint you'll enjoy a classic performance!!  I know I clapped, sweated, cheered, and sang along to all the songs I grew up with.",1203897600,,1454,4.881632653061224
3279769,5,B00102FELM,"I just watched this DVD for the first time,and what a show! The Scorpions prove again that they are the BEST LIVE BAND EVER! I have been saying that for 30 years now and this DVD proves it again. The band is awesome. And with guests Uli Jon Roth,Micheal Schenker, and Herman Rarebell this is truly a must have for any Scorpions fan. It was shot during the tour for the Unbreakable album,and the track list covers all era's of the band's extensive record catalog. From Speedy's Coming and Pictured Life to Love 'Em or Leave 'Em. This show ROCKS! Crank up the surround sound and enjoy!",1203465600,2,583,4.457943925233645
