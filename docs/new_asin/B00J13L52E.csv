Universal - U.S.A.

DIRECTOR:
George Waggner

CAST:
Preston Foster, Sabu, Kent Taylor, Maria Montez (As: Rita)

COMMENTS:
Maria Montez plays a firebrand Spanish dancer named Rita who is determined to find the Nazi war criminal who killed her father. The trail takes her dancing feet to North Africa where she meets down-and-out journalist Paul Kenyon (Paige) who is seeking to revitalize his career by exposing a series of murders perpetrated in pursuit of a huge diamond, including death via elevator and, intentionally hilarious, the effervescent Sabu singing ""She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain"" in his brand of pidgin English.

This movie was made to please the demands of Montez, she wanted to stop being the heroine of the romantic adventures in Technicolor which made her famous.",1414886400,,860,5.202898550724638
