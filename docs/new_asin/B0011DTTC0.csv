8241442,5,B0011DTTC0,"When this movie came out in the cinema, I was too young to see it, so I missed out on the ""True Experience"" of it.  But, in the following months, I had become a Tarantino and Rodriguez fanatic in every sense of the word.  So, when these movies came out on DVD I was the first in line to rent them.  I absolutely LOVED both movies for different (and obvious) reasons.

  Planet Terror:  This movie was great! It pays homage to every great zombie movie out there. And with its mix of CGI and (awesome) cheesey practical effects, it is not one to be missed.  Also (SPOILERS) its lack of a second act with the missing reel and utter confusion on what went on during that time, is sheer brilliance!

  Death Proof:  Although this is the lesser liked of the two, I personally thought this one was better if only by a little.  This half of the double feature is part slasher film and part intense car chase film.  Call me a Tarantino fanboy or whatever you will but his dialog genious.  He made you cling onto every word and text message of the opening group of girls.  Not many movies can do that, to me anyway.  Also the climactic car chase had my heat pumping with adrenaline the entire time! This was a great revenge/action/slasher movie that has come out in a long time.

  Now you can imagine my frustration when I found out there were fake trailers and ads cut out that had never seen the light of day other than on the big screen.  I had caught it somewhat on movie channels (Yes it took so long to release it that movie channels saw it before DVD did) but it just didn't feel right.  Also many people said the shorter theatrical versions were better than the extended cuts.  I had to see this cut if it was the last thing I did!  So, I got a great deal on it brand new and also bought a region free DVD player.  And let me tell you, it was fantastic.  The 3 hour and 11 minute runtime goes by like a snap.  The fake trailers are hilarious and really add to the overall experience.  I do like the shorter versions better, because the pacing seems to work more than the extended cuts.  This is More than worth it and I would recommend it to anyone who likes these directors, or Grinhouse cinema in general.
  And with the addition of both extended cuts and a load of all new special features, this box set is a must have.",1281657600,4,2321,4.230593607305936
8241443,5,B0011DTTC0,"The Grindhouse 6 disc pictures alone got me excited about receiving this, but when it arrived it was even better. The attention to detail on this has been seen through right to the end, so if the pictures alone make you want this wait till you have it. This is not just a crappy cardboard box. As described its all here - the extended cuts and the double feature, complete with fake trailers. If you are concerned about the menu being in japanese, don't bother,it may be written different, but it is still all in the same order no matter what the language.",1276387200,4,556,4.407766990291262
