8177124,4,B000NDIATW,We love the Modern Marvels series.  Very informative and educational.  This one was funny too.  Learned some of the special effects and gadgets used in the movies.,1425081600,,163,4.962962962962963
8177125,5,B000NDIATW,"My dad is a HUGE James Bond fan.  I grew up watching all the movies with him.  He has a room dedicated to all manner of signed photos, model cars, etc including all the Bond actors, many Bond girls, and Odd Job and Goldfinger (his favorite movie).

I bought this for him as a Christmas present.  This isn't something that's really worth watching more than once, but the amount of joy we got out of watching it was worth the price many times over!

If you are a Bond fan or know of one, it's worth watching.",1412121600,,506,4.175257731958763
8177126,5,B000NDIATW,"What fun to see a history of the gadgets in the James Bond movies, some of which I'd forgotten about.  This is a must-have for Bond aficionados.",1389744000,,144,4.333333333333333
8177127,5,B000NDIATW,"My hubby is a complete James Bond fan so when I saw this DVD I knew it was going to be a success and I was right. He has enjoyed watching this DVD and remenissing about yesteryears and about being a spy on a covert operations. Would reccommend this to any other Bond, James Bond fans who loves things shaken (up) not Stirred (dangled out of reach).",1357689600,,348,4.208955223880597
8177128,3,B000NDIATW,Not a lot was covered in this DVD. A lot of time about jet packs but not much coverage about other great James Bond gadgets.,1357171200,,124,4.0
8177129,3,B000NDIATW,"Forty years of Bond movies established the genre as the standard for gadgets.  This DVD confirms that these gadgets were based on reality and actually still work.

The first displayed is an acrobatic homemade small jet plane (12' long, 17' wingspan, 12"" engine diameter) that goes 325 mph and up to 35,000 feet.

Then on to an underwater tow sled with CO2-operated harpoon guns used in ""Thunderball.""  The 20-minute fight scene took 3 months to film. The sled no longer has its electric motor, so in this DVD was towed by thin line monofilament.

""The Man With the Golden Gun"" featured a 360-degree barrel turn over water using an AMC stunt car.  This feat was recreated in the DVD; precision is required - speed must be between 39.5 and 40.5 mph, and placement within 2 inches.  Viewers also learn that the movie's chase scenes were done in real Bangkok traffic with a movie official following to pay off damages to damaged vehicles.

The DVD ends at the International Spy Museum in D.C. - primarily a display for real spy weapons, tools and disguises, but also featuring additional Bond regalia.",1221782400,2,1097,4.767195767195767
8177130,5,B000NDIATW,"My copy of ""James Bond Gadgets"" was BEAUTIFULLY captioned by WGBH, but A&E says it's not. Since I don't have documentation, I haven't submitted the correction to Amazon. If you depend on captions, I don't know what to tell you to be sure you get a CC copy; subtitles aren't available.

Anyway, the show is excellent!!! It's fun and informative; I had no idea that the rocket backpack was actually a real invention, not just for TV. I can't help but wonder why the thing wasn't ever produced for the masses, or, at least, produced more than it was? Learning about the other cars, boats, and ""stuff"" of Bond legend was just a blast!!!",1219190400,2,632,4.543859649122807
