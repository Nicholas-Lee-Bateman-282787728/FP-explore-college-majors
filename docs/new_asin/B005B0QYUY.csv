We both loved the Christmas songs done by great musicians and singers with accents. I've been to Ireland's pubs and this music was very much to the pub's tradition of minimal musical accompaniment, and strong voice. That is the traditional form of Irish music, the reason for such here. The dancers seemed a bit more contemporary in the way they performed folk dance, not the rigid upper body format seen in Riverdance and what I witnessed in the real pubs of Ireland. Yet the visualization dance with the musical background was pleasing.
The DVD simply ended much too soon. I wanted more.
Some songs are sung in the Gaelic language, such as Silent Night. Goosebumps.",1509753600,,796,4.733812949640288

The Angels incorporate some traditional Christmas songs as well as a few Gaelic tunes as well.",1389052800,,255,4.688888888888889
8463812,3,B005B0QYUY,"Let me first say, I completely agree with the previous review and I'll add a few more observations.  The lack of a live audience was way too obvious so there was no reaction or interaction with each performance.  Some of the songs were abruptly ended to accommodate what was a TV commercial or personal comments from the performers.
Also, there was very little musical accompaniment with each song.  Most performances included either a violin or an acoustical guitar.  There was an electric piano on one performance and a harp on occasion.  Overall, the show was reasonably well done and the talent of the performers is good but not outstanding.  It's a good buy at the current price of about $3.00. I wouldn't recommend spending a whole lot more or you may end up feeling like you didn't get much bang for your buck.",1322697600,2,817,4.678321678321678
