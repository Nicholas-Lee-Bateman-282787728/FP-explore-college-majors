Okay, so you're shocked to realize that you're over 30 and MTV  doesn't play 'real' music videos anymore... what to do???
Spend your hard earned discretionary income on video compilations  of off-beat New Wave bands?!?  Sounds most excellent!!!  And in this case it would be... really, except for the following:
1) There are no hard dates given for any of the videos.  No  production dates, no release dates, no idea when the video first  appeared.  This really bothers me.  Human memory is sometimes quite fickle, and I don't feel like playing pop-culture archeologist for every video on the tape.  Just a few brief blurbs on the back of the box would have been really nice.
2) The run-time of each video isn't listed either.  This gets  annoying if you'd like to know whether a particular video is an  'extended' version or not... which quickly brings us to:
3) Some of the videos are extended or un-cut editions that rarely  saw the light of day in the 80's.  Sometimes this is good.  For  example, Duran Duran's 'Girls On Film' is complete with full-frontal female nudity.  And while I'm not complaining, I'm  pretty sure I didn't see that version playing on MTV back when I was a kid.  (Talk about 'I want my MTV'!)  Also, 'Come On Eileen' by Dexy's Midnight Runners is an extended version with a painfully drawn out bridge.  (You really wouldn't believe how  much it hurts to watch.)  I remember the shorter, bouncier  version, and I really missed not seeing it.  A great idea would have been to present both the 'standard' and extended/un-cut versions of the same video played back to back for comparison.  At only 35 minutes total play time for the entire tape, this could have easily been done.  And speaking of the actual video  tape...
4) The overall tape quality is shockingly poor.  There are audio  drops and video skips throughout.  Most of the video images are fuzzy at best, and the audio doesn't exactly thunder either.  Rhino used a very cheap tape, a very cheap duplication method, or both, and it really shows.
The Bottom Line:
Get this tape if it's reasonably priced, but don't expect too  much in the way of technical presentation.  The videos themselves  are either loved or hated on their own merit.  It's just that the  end result of slapping them together on a video tape could have  been done so much better.",997488000,39,2726,4.809110629067245
