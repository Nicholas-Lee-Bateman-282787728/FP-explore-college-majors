This movie Messenger could have been better, because it's about a man who gets a job as a bike messenger and his bike gets stolen, and he never gets his bike back. Seeing Richard Barboza in this movie not get his bike back was kinda sad, and I wish his bike had not been stolen by the thief in this movie Messenger, especially with him having a pregnant wife and a son, which he also does in this movie. And Richard Barboza is played as (Jeff Rogers) in this movie Messenger, and I also didn't like the scene in this movie where he gets beat up by bike thief and the other guy. I sure wish Jeff could have gotten his bike back, because he had gotten a job as a bike messenger, and without it he couldn't go to work. I don't even find the last scene in this movie was a good scene, because it shows Jeff and his pregnant wife being at a park, and Jeff gets beat up again by a couple of guys. And his pregnant wife tries to break up the fight to save him, but ends up in pain from her pregnancy. Like I said, this movie Messenger could have been better than it was. It's still worth watching,  though.",1518566400,,1131,4.026666666666666
