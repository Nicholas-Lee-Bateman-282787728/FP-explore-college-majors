2933964,5,B000V8ZN3K,"I have been a big fan for a long time .... and loved the box set of the TV series.
But these TV Specials were so much fun to watch",1366934400,,130,3.3666666666666667
2933965,5,B000V8ZN3K,This is a Very Funny and Great DVD Movies from the Captain and Tennille! The whole Family will love these!,1343433600,,106,4.35
2933966,3,B000V8ZN3K,"Truth be told, these TV specials are awful. Endless jokes about the Captain's hat, hokey musical numbers, B-list guest stars. These shows were actually on network TV? That being said, for a couple bucks per special it's kinda fun to watch how cheesy this stuff was. Buy these for nostalgia purposes only, there's no great music here.",1331596800,,333,4.859649122807017
2933967,5,B000V8ZN3K,"For anyone a true fan of The Captain & Tennille, this is the true collectors' DVD set, a must for every fan who grew up in the late 1970's and early 1980's during the peak of the musical couple's career.  After their ABC variety show was cancelled after one season, Toni Tennille and Daryl ""The Captain"" Dragon went on an exclusive tour to try and win back fans who weren't buying their records anymore, mainly because the weekly ABC television variety show nearly ruined their wholesome image.  The silly comedy sketches they had to get involved in weren't their style and fans knew it the whole time.  Despite all that, the couple did agree to do a few TV specials.  One set in New Orleans, another set in Hawaii, and another just set in a simple stage studio.  These TV specials focused a lot more on music and less comedy stuff.  Musical guests on the three DVD set include Fats Domino, Kenny Rogers, Glen Campbell, Ella Fitzgerald, B.B. King, among others with a little comic relief from Don Knotts and John Byner.
Toni and Daryl wanted to be known just for their musical talent, and to prove they were no ""Sonny & Cher"".  The last TV special, ""Songbook"" was an entire show dedicated to music.  That was the kind of show they always wanted to do because The Captain & Tennille was all about music and nothing else.",1277164800,17,1319,4.512605042016807
2933968,5,B000V8ZN3K,"These are the most enjoyable DVD's I own!  The music is magical and Toni and Daryl are fantastic. The commentaries are so much fun, I laugh out loud right along with them.  Definately worth the price.  Will make a great gift for any age.",1194480000,9,237,4.340909090909091
2933969,5,B000V8ZN3K,Watching these past videos have been such a wonderful experience for me.  They truly transport me back to my young boyhood.  To see these episodes again is like a dream come true.,1193097600,11,179,4.5625

8217283,4,B000V8ZN3K,"Truly a guilty pleasure, but their specials hold up better than their variety show because the specials were simply about the music.",1423699200,,132,5.045454545454546
8217284,3,B000V8ZN3K,"Would not buy this DVD again, I was looking for the TV version.",1416009600,,63,3.923076923076923
8217285,5,B000V8ZN3K,"Wonderful journey down memory lane with these two very talented people. The ""Songbook"" disc is the best in my opinion linking up Toni with Ella Fitzgerald in a love fest of song then bringing together Glen Campbell with Toni and Daryl for some hot country licks and topping it all off with B.B. King and an all star band with Daryl taking a shot at some heart felt blues, and he does a good job. These 3 specials were, for any fan, and for some who will become fans of this dynamic duo, a great addition to my nostalgia 70s collection. Take a shotyou might just get ""muskrat love.""",1411084800,,581,4.339449541284404

8217287,1,B000V8ZN3K,"I didn't like anything, I could not appreciate any of his successes, he hoped that they sing without having any guest.

I hope you can recommend some DVD, with their best hits and without any guest...

I disappointed...

My friends do not want them or gifted.

I hope your comments.",1398470400,,282,4.58

I wish Dragon had opened a music school....I would have attended.",1388016000,,152,4.666666666666667
8217289,4,B000V8ZN3K,TV specials are superior to network tv show. New Orleans show especially enjoyable. Hawaii also is well done. This is better deal than tv show clips.,1376092800,4,149,4.769230769230769
