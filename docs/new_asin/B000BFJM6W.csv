2415725,4,B000BFJM6W,"This is the type of movie you'll find yourself remembering with fondness because it is so incredibly, unabashedly bad. The clothing alone was worth at least three stars; most of the guys had on tight mom jeans of the buttock hugging nature, one fancy fellow was sporting a pair that was seriously acid washed, and another guy had a nose-to-ear chain that he paired with mom jeans and a fetching low scoop boatneck top. SEH-XY. Our heroine swerves rapidly back and forth between spunky in-your-face bravery and shrieks of fear, but she can sure shine up an ax (as demonstrated in a nice long scene). Not sure where the Born to Shop as featured on the cover comes into play, unless it's the tasteful Eddie Bauer sweater and granny skirt she rocks almost the entire movie. Not sure how the woman on the DVD cover factors in, either - she is not in the movie. Anywhere. Favourite scene: our heroine is trapped on the hood of the car and then escapes by stepping on a conveniently lined up row of faces. All the women in the first part of the movie mysteriously disappear, although there is one random scene where two bad-guy chicks are sitting on the hood of a truck as it bounces along, and they are each halfheartedly shaking a fist off and on. Last but not least: Worst. Acting. Ever. Really. This gem is so bad I'm giving it four stars for its baldfaced lack of shame. I will remember little snippets of this movie when I need a mood upper.",1299888000,5,1440,4.458333333333333

2415733,5,B000BFJM6W,"They Call Me Macho Woman is one heck of a fun movie! It has lots of action, suspense, and humor. The only thing it doesn't have is nudity, which I was expecting since this is a late 80's / early 90's exploitation movie. Still, it is plenty entertaining even without t & a.",1431302400,2,272,4.150943396226415

2415735,4,B000BFJM6W,"Let's start by saying this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen plot wise and acting wise. But man is it funny. First caught this on TV when it was called Savage Instinct. Basically about a city girl looking to buy some property in the country, but runs into a drug op. The thugs are great, one appears or be wearing a body suit with blue jeans and has some great face jewelry. Another dude gets stabbed in the ear and says ""huh, what'd you say"" every time someone talks to him. The cameraman seems obsessed with filming people's feet as they run. Stunt doubles for the girl is some guy with a wig and a mustache, and the boss of the operation is Mongo, who kills with a spike attached to a head band. Favorite part? When the girl takes the most rusty axe and nails ever and cleans them(with what appears to be water) to a gleaming chrome finish. 90% of the movie is the girl being caught then escaping again. Think this happens like 4 times. The girl on the cover is not in the movie, but I read somewhere that she's on the box because she's the directors niece.  One of the best Troma movies ever!",1344470400,6,1104,4.2075471698113205

8086107,1,B000BFJM6W,"Susan inadvertently stumbles onto a drug smuggling ring while her realtor gets a flat tire while driving her to see a house. The leader of said drug ring, Mongo (whom only has one week until retirement) thinking she knows much more than this bubbly blond actually does seeks to make sure she won't tell anyone anything and thus begins one of the more bone headed films that I've sat through.

All the actors in this film can't really act in the least. Susan makes a pretty ineffectual hero for most of the movie (she'd never escape multiple times if not for the fact that seemingly every one in the movie wants to have sex with her) and she doesn't take the offensive until the last 20 minutes of the flick. When she does she spouts some generic ""I have had enough"" line, preach on sister, that very thought ran through my mind multiple times when I was watching this",1516579200,,867,4.452830188679245
