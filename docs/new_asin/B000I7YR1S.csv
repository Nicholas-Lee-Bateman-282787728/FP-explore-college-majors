This is a lot of fun great actors. Rex Harrison. Funny, Its a great movie to have I have seen it at least 10 times or more.
Silly , great banter. the more times that you watch it the more of the words and funny lines you hear. Everyone is so young. I love old movies",1390262400,,349,4.0

8144325,4,B000I7YR1S,"So I'd just like to say that I am not able to comment on the DVD itself as I don't own it. But the film is marvellous - full of witty dialogue from Coward and crisp direction from Lean. Harrison was a great comic actor and made the whole thing look very easy. If you've only ever seen him in My Fair Lady or Dr Doolittle it is definitely worth watching him at his charming best here.
The one thing I did want to say was that the product description above is wrong when it says Harrison tries to kill himself to be with his first wife. Slight spoiler alert now.....it is his ghostly first wife that tries to murder him so that they will be together again.
Anyway, do watch the movie if you get a chance, it's a great ride with many pleasures to be had.",1238025600,3,751,4.081081081081081
