It is EXACTLY, 100% the same story line from beginning to end.  Only difference is Ian Chesterton character is not included and Barbara Wright is not some companion picked up on earth by mistake, but something like the Doctor's secretary.  The granddaughter Susan is still portrayed, just with a different actress.

My opinion is save your money and get the original, made for TV movie of ""The Daleks"" with William Hartnell.  It may not have all the bells and whistles as the Peter Cushing version, but it was done much better.",1430352000,4,676,4.6

5647138,3,B00BM8W94E,"Just to clarify, this movie was released in 1966, not in the 1990's as some other reviewers think. This means that it's not a re-imagining of Dr. Who, but rather one of the first incarnations of Dr. Who. It's the sequel to 1965's Dr. Who and the Daleks. Since the Dr. Who series originally began in 1963, this movie should not be considered a re-imagining of Dr. Who but rather one of the original incarnations of Dr. Who (I can't stress that enough). It was also released well before Star Wars, and at the same time as Star Trek the original series, so keep in mind that you're watching a 1960's sci-fi movie. That being said, I think Peter Cushing's portrayal of Dr. Who is much better than William Hartnell's portrayal of Dr. Who from 1963 to 1966. Hartnell's portrayal was frankly just boring. I would caution fans of the 21st century versions of Dr. Who that this movie may not be for them because the Doctor is not an alien but rather a human in the two Peter Cushing movies. From 1966 to the present, it has been decided that Dr. Who is an alien time lord from Gallifrey, but this early EXPERIMENTAL film portrayed the Dr. as an eccentric inventor who was a human time traveler. I enjoyed it, but Dr. Who purists will hate it.",1416960000,2,1233,4.412280701754386

A man of mystery, a man of time and space, a man known only as...The Doctor.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: STUDIOCANAL's release of Daleks  Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.' on Blu-ray, is to celebrate actor Peter Cushing's centennial and the 50th Anniversary of the beloved BBC show Doctor Who. Though only loosely based on the plot of the BBC Television show, these two films were the first time audiences had a chance to see the Doctor and the wildly popular Daleks on film and in colour. Produced by Amicus Studios, Hammer's biggest rivals, these films were an attempt to beat Hammer in the family-friendly adventure/fantasy market. Daleks - Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.' more or less continues where Dr. Who & The Daleks' left off, with the Doctor and his companions fighting off the Daleks and their quest for planetary domination.

Much of the cast and crew returned from Dr. Who and the Daleks, including star Peter Cushing and director Gordon Flemyng. Die hard Doctor Who fans should be forewarned that this is not a faithful adaptation of the TV show, namely the Doctor Who TV serial episode The Dalek Invasion of Earth. In the two Amicus films, Doctor Who is not a humanoid alien, rather he is simply an intelligent, kindly old grandfather who has managed to build a police box-shaped time machine and has the surname of Who.

This time, Doctor Who [Peter Cushing] takes his time machine, the T.A.R.D.I.S., to Earth's future in 2150. Along with him travels his niece [Jill Curzon] and his granddaughter Susan [Roberta Tovey] reprising her role from the first film. Joined by Tom [Bernard Cribbins], a local police constable from the present, they discover that Daleks have travelled to Earth and decimated much of the planet. The remaining humans have either been turned into slaves or workers, though there is a small underground resistance. The Doctor and Tom are kidnapped by the Daleks, while his niece and granddaughter team up with the leader of the resistance Wyler [Andrew Keir] to rescue them, stage an attack on the Dalek stronghold, and prevent the Daleks from unleashing a devastating bomb.

This film feels less childlike and fantastical than its predecessor due to the futuristic Earth setting and more obvious sci-fi influences, namely War of the Worlds. There are also allusions to WWII with the destroyed, bombed-out look of London, again making the film more topically interesting for adult Doctor Who fans. This also heightens the drama and suspense, somewhat improving the plot over Dr. Who & The Daleks.' The acting is about on par with the first film, simply moving the same characters, or at least character types, to a more dramatic setting.

The London-based set does the characters a lot of favours and overall this feels like a much more dramatic film for Peter Cushing's Doctor. Peter Cushing is still likely to surprise and possibly disappoint fans of the early Doctor Who, but he gives it his all, even though he was ill during filming, which caused a delay in production, along with numerous accidents on set. Roberta Tovey returns as his granddaughter from the first film and is equally charming. Jill Curzon and Bernard Cribbins replaces Jennie Linden and Roy Castle, and though Bernard Cribbins was the comic relief, is an improvement and slight edge over Roy Castle.

The special effects are about what you would expect from a Doctor Who film it is very entertaining and somewhat impressive at times, but there are also plenty of moments where you can see things like the strings holding up the Dalek saucer. As with Dr. Who & The Daleks' there is some unintended humour, but this is better balanced in Daleks  Invasion Earth 2150 A.D. by suspenseful scenes of chaos in London and the Daleks causing much more destruction than in the first film. Though Daleks  Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.' had a larger budget than Dr. Who & The Daleks' it was not nearly as successful as its predecessor, resulting in the cancellation of a planned third film. There is also a somewhat humorous level of product placement from cereal company Sugar Puffs, which you should keep an eye out for if you watch the film. Daleks  Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.' is the better of the two films, but unfortunately didn't do as well at the box office as the first. An option for a third film, presumably to be based on The Chase, was not taken up.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Daleks  Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.' was filmed in in its original aspect ratio of Techniscope 2.35:1 aspect ratio and is presented digitally re-mastered in 1080p Technicolor resolution. But Techniscope was also known as quite a grainy format, and that's quite noticeable in the pre-credits sequences, set in contemporary (i.e. mid-Sixties) London at night. All told, this is a grainier film, and a grainier Blu-ray than the first film. But its grain that is supposed to be there. Skin-tones look fine and consistent with the way they tend to look in other colour films of this vintage. Colours in general are more muted, but blacks are solid and shadow detail what it should be.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  STUDIOCANAL gives us a 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio track that comes with optional English SDH subtitles for the hearing impaired. The lossless track opens up the film in all the right places. The clashes between the Daleks and the rebels, in particular, have good intensity and a few of the explosions actually surprise with very good depth. However, I think that it is Bill McGuffie's music score that benefits the most from the treatment - the jazzy themes are quite bright and well rounded. The audio track sounds clear and there is a decent mix between dialogue, the numerous sound effects, and the score. There is a slight hiss, due to the age of the print. The film was sound-designed to be in mono and released in cinemas in mono, and that's what it remains on this disc, in a 2.0 LPCM track. Dialogue, music and sound effects are clear and well balanced, and again thanks to STUDIOCANAL for including optional hard-of-hearing subtitles. Given the number of explosions and other special sound effects in this film, let's be thankful that no one has decided to remix this into fake 5.1 surround sound.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras: Much of the following extras is somewhat of a rehash from the extras on the first film, but will still be of interest for any Doctor Who and Peter Cushing fans.

Special Feature: Restoring Daleks  Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.' [1080p] [7:11] Again we hear from BFI curator Jo Botting talking about the challenge to cinema from television and how scope formats were part of the arsenal used by distributors to get audiences back in cinemas. Marcus Hearn discusses Gordon Flemyng's use of widescreen Techniscope. Techniscope's poorer image quality was also a problem that faced Deluxe when they restored the film from a 35mm interpositive made in 1969 from the Techniscope negative. Grading and repair are discussed by Paul Collard and John Heath while additional manual frame repairs are demonstrated by Lisa Copson and Ian Pickford returns to explain the audio restoration.

Special Feature: Interview with Actor Bernard Cribbins [1080p] [4:02] An all too brief chat with 'national treasure' Bernard Cribbins about the legacy of the film, and his contribution to the film and interactions with Peter Cushing, previously in the film She' during the shooting of the film. Bernard Cribbins also stated that working with Peter Cushing, he always looked to me as though he was chewing a mint... and then he would speak. Bernard Cribbins tells a story about how chief Dalek operator Robert Jewell's Australian-accented on-set Dalek voice caused him and Peter Cushing to corpse, much to Gordon Flemyng's displeasure and also getting the giggles with the Daleks. He also touches on his interview with Barry Letts for the role of the Doctor shortly after Jon Pertwee vacated the role on television. The sound mix on this feature does not seem to have a middle channel included and is directed to left and right channels, resulting in a very echoing quality.

Special Feature: Interview with author Gareth Owen [1080p] [5:00] Gareth Owen, author of The Shepperton Story, discusses the production history of Daleks  Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D. Gareth Owen talks about what he did on the first Blu-ray disc extras, especially giving a brief overview of the circumstances of the film's production, much of the London location shoot being done by stealth on Sunday mornings.

Special Feature: Stills Gallery [1080p] [2:00] A disappointingly small collection of black and white promotional images, behind the scenes stills, model shots, ad campaigns, the campaign book and a Jill Curzon colour promotional image. Not exactly comprehensive and it strangely doesn't include the many posters or lobby cards which were issued. This is a self-navigating stills gallery of production stills.

Theatrical Trailer [3:00] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for Daleks  Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D.' A trailer in which the voice over fails to mention the word Dalek or the character Doctor Who and leaves you with the impression that the Robomen were in charge of the Daleks were their henchmen. Not a patch on the iconic Dr. Who & The Daleks' trailer.

Finally, overall this is a really fun, sci-fi-themed film loosely based on the early Doctor Who series. Though Peter Cushing's human Doctor Who lacks the menace and cold intelligence of the first official Doctor Who William Hartnell. Peter Cushing fans and Dalek fanatics will want to seek out both of these Doctor Who films for their undeniable entertainment value despite [or because of] moments of silliness. STUDIOCANAL has done a fine job releasing them both on Blu-ray and the combined special features are very enjoyable. North American audiences should be forewarned that this Blu-ray release is Region B/2 and will only play on a Multi-region Blu-ray players. These 2 New Re-mastered Blu-ray releases are brilliant and if you are an avid Doctor Who fan, you will love these 2 Doctor Who films and will give you lots of viewing pleasure and viewing these Blu-ray discs on my 46"" SAMSUNG 3D Smart Television and via my Pioneer Home Cinema set and was even better than when I saw these films in the cinema, which was a joy to behold and proud to have these Doctor Who films in my Blu-ray Collection and will give sci-fi fans endless hours of enjoyment. Highly Recommended!

8570716,4,B00BM8W94E,"I'd seen bits and pieces of this throughout the years, notably from the 70s on TV up through the early 80s on weekend afternoon television.  But then it disappeared, and I never did get to see the whole thing.  Truth be told I did manage to catch chunk of it, but found the film a bit boring for a scifi film that catered to kids.  I was a kid in the 70s, so there you go.

The chief problem with this film is that it lacks plot.  You have a story about the Doctor and gang going to another time in Earth's history, but then the story really doesn't have anything driving it forward other than the Doctor's staple bad guys, the Daleks.  And even then it's not much of a film to ponder.  As per the interviews on the bluray John Pertwee was playing the TV doctor at this point (or so I believe), and the stories there were far more interesting and plot driven than this film.

The acting is good, it's not deep British thesping, but the British version of 60's action fluff.  The special effects are okay for the time in which it was shot, save the TARDIS doesn't vanish at any point in the film.

Eh, it's a film of its time, and the restored print looks incredible, but again the lack of a more salient and involved plot hamper the film from the get go.  And I think that's probably what the audiences were reacting to when this film was first released.  Just not a whole lot happens here, and some of the scene really feel like filler as per one of the docs on the bluray.

Still, of you're a Dr. Who fan, then maybe scope out a copy for your library.

Oh, and the Daleks look great it color, btw.

Now I wish they made more of these versions.  Though, again, I don't know how one could ever blend the 2 story lines (the British traditional & this made-for-U.S.).  Oh, that's it.
