8513201,3,B007AAEZ7W,"I completely understand that obscure movies like this do not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would've gladly paid a dollar more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movies on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

I enjoyed all the movies great entertainment. 5-Stars.",1478390400,2,383,4.861538461538461
8513202,5,B007AAEZ7W,"The passionate plumber has always gotten a horrible rap... why, even Keaton himself I believe detested these MGM movies (all except ""the cameraman"") but i actually liked it, it was cohesive, funny and well timed...He is just as graceful to see here as in any of his silents...thing is, many of his fans don't want to accept his spoken movies and shorts and that is a mistake for they are beautiful in their own way...and hell, to see those eyes as they mature and mellow is just priceless.",1451692800,,489,4.568181818181818

8513204,3,B007AAEZ7W,"This release from Warners is the newest rage, that consists here of two DVD-R's(on demand) that have Buster Keaton's Parlor Bedroom and Bath(released Feb/31),Speak Easily(released Aug/32) and The Passionate Plumber(released Feb/32).These are all so-so Keaton entries that,surprisingly today,made money. But that was mostly due to MGMs big promotional machine and their block booking policies with theatres. They are not Keaton's most shining moments on screen,and although there are a few pure Keaton moments,there is very little to shout about.
Parlour,Bedroom and Bath is a farce that has Keaton as a sign tacker who falls for a rich socialite,who he spies wandering around a big estate with other guests. When he is hit by one of the party goers he is put up in the house until he gets better. While there Keaton is used as a patsy. The guy who hit him has been after a girl to marry,but she won't until her hard to catch sister gets married. So Keaton is blown up as this veritable Don Juan to land her.
The film has lots of bedroom farce,faux pauxs and mix ups associated with a story like this. The film was filmed on Keaton's own estate,and magnificent it was. Keaton uses some routines from older films but over all the pace is stop and go,and no gag really builds up much steam. It's alot of running around by all concerned with a twisted and sometimes confusing plot. Besides Keaton the film stars Reginald Denny and old stage veteran Charlotte Greenwood. 2 1/2 stars.
Speak Easily is a vehicle for Keaton and Jimmy Durante. Durante is the stage manager of a traveling show and Keaton is a stodgy college professor. Keaton falls for one of the principals when he ends up on the same train as the troupe. On vacation he ends up following the troupe and eventually bankrolls the show onto Broadway. When there,an actress played by Thelma Todd tries to seduce Keaton, but in the end he stays true to his first crush. When Keaton's dough goes poof,the show is almost closed but goes on to become a hit.
This is the best of the bunch as far as these films go. Keaton does have at least some decent gags once in a while. Durante plays himself to good effect. I always found that these two were oil and water. Both were great at what they did,just not together. The plot ,like the others,is weak and it shows its translucence more than once. 3 stars.
Lastly is The Passionate Plumber. This is one mixed up whale of a tale. Keaton is a plumber in Paris. His friend,Durante,thinks Keatons invention of a laser sight on a gun is terrific and he tries to help him approach some military folks with his idea. Trouble is when he does he ends up in hot water,having to duel with someone. Concurrently with this is a girl he meets who is getting two timed by a romancing romeo. At first the guy is intimidating and seems on the level that he likes Keaton's girl. But he finds he is also seeing another hot blooded Latin lady. In the end Keaton arranges to have the two meet him at the same time and have it out. The result isn't good for the romeo,but pretty good for Keaton.
This mixed up plot has Keaton and Durante running all over the screen trying to keep up with the ultra weak story line that is THE PP.It is silly and I might even say stupid at times. The running duel gag gets tiresome VERY fast. This film should have been given to a lesser comic with nothing to lose,not a pro like Keaton. 1 1/2-2 stars.
Technically the films are in their full screen a/r and are not in as good as shape as one would want them to be. They have done little work on them,just adjusted the contrast and clarity is all I can see. Other than that they are filled with defects associated with films of their ages.
All in all,this two disc set of Keaton films is just filling in the Keaton blanks as far as his MGM output goes. This is really for Keaton compleatists like myself, who want his entire output of films from MGM.They are now thankfully all available,but mostly on these DVD-R's that are Warner's newest hook. Not liking the hook,but I like the bait.",1391472000,,4045,4.497282608695652
8513205,4,B007AAEZ7W,"These are Keaton's best work, but if you're a big fan like me they're a must. Besides, they aren't all bad and are entertaining and different from his silent work since he speaks in these. My box came with a crack in it :( but other than that I was completely happy with my purchase.",1377561600,,283,4.163636363636364
8513206,5,B007AAEZ7W,"With his glory days as an independent filmmaker well behind him, the Great Stone Face--one of the major forces in silent comedy--did his best to cope with big studio MGM's indifference to comedy crafting. The three talkies included in this DVD package are both heartening & somewhat sad. One thing's for sure from these films: No matter how slight or ill-suited the material, Buster Keaton was always giving 100% of himself. In short, if all else failed, HE was reliable. Let's get to the films...
""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" might be the most unique offering (Can you imagine Keaton in a BEDROOM FARCE??). As a sign poster who gets accidentally struck by a socialite's car, this ""introduces"" him into high society as he becomes an unwitting ""pawn in love"". While the premise sounds completely ill-suited for a physical clown like Keaton (after all, the closest he came to this kind of material was the silent ""Seven Chances""), he handles the story surprisingly well. As usual, the best moments come when Keaton is NOT talking, using his superior athletic abilities to override the story & allow pleasing echoes of silent comedy to emerge. Keaton was always a man of action, and his sequences trying to outrun the estate's staff or tripping over his own two feet are welcome reliefs from what is primarily a static situation comedy. But Keaton manages to make the extended climax refreshingly offbeat as he demonstrates his ridiculous approach to wooing not just one woman, but a dizzying parade of them.
""Speak Easily"" might be the best of the three films. Playing against type as a mousy, bespectacled professor who's urged to ""get out & see life"", and winds up financing a stage troupe's big production, Keaton immerses himself in character. Apparently, it was someone's idea to pair Keaton with brash Jimmy Durante in this picture. It was safe to say that the two men's comedy styles were set too far apart to truly click as a comedy team. Besides, evidence shows that Durante clearly had a secondary role in this & future Keaton productions, while Keaton remained the central figure, securing top billing. As mentioned, Keaton's superb comic timing was impossible to ignore, especially in such sequences as Keaton being dragged by a train while holding on to his beloved trunk; his drunken romp with blond bombshell Thelma Todd; or the climactic show which Keaton bumbles his way through. Durante's gutteral stock-in-trade pronunciation of ""woids"" contrasted well against Keaton's dense use of vocabulary.
""The Passionate Plumber"" is probably the weakest offering. Playing a plumber in Paris who's hired to fix a socialite's leaky bathroom, he gets hopelessly stuck on a merry-go-round of love, jealously, and double-crosses. The main problem is that while Keaton is typically good, the story seems weak & disjointed, and just not as funny. Had they used Keaton's wonderful physical antics more often, it might have rescued the film from its own mediocrity. Durante's pretty much stuck on the sidelines here. Polly Moran--usually a foil for Marie Dressler--has some brief comic moments as a maid. Despite an amusing opening gun duel, this is not one of Keaton's best.
But for any fan or viewer curious about Keaton's talking picture career, this collection is definitely worth a look.",1350691200,,3288,5.045955882352941
8513207,4,B007AAEZ7W,"Here we have 1 of Keaton's ""Best"" sound films at MGM. While I beleive that ""Speak Easily"" is the best talkie Buster made at MGM, ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" is not that bad. ""The Passionate Plumber"" is a dull film that the overbearing Durante dominates. The transfers are good, all coming from 35mm elements. While ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" is PD and has been issued before, this print is the best I have ever seen. ""Speak Easily"" and ""The Passionate Plumber"" were both issued on Laser Disc, but the print used here is much improved. All in all a good buy for twenty bucks. My only gripe is why did Warners issue the remaining films seperatly?",1340582400,5,643,4.551724137931035
8513208,3,B007AAEZ7W,"Three of Buster Keaton's MGM talkies finally receive an official DVD release. Artistically inferior to his silent features, the MGM vehicles were reliable box-office hits  much to the comedian's dismay. ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" (1931) and ""Speak Easily"" (1932) include several imaginative routines that showcase Buster's mastery of sound when the studio gave him a chance. His best MGM talkie, ""Speak Easily"" displays Keaton's flair for verbal humor as he works surprisingly well with Jimmy Durante in this enjoyable musical-comedy. Adapted from a claustrophobic stage farce, Keaton and director Edward Sedgwick transform ""Parlor, Bedroom and Bath"" into an uneven yet occasionally hilarious film  highlighted by a classic ""lovemaking"" sequence with Charlotte Greenwood. Unfortunately, ""The Passionate Plumber"" (1932) is depressingly mediocre, with Buster's few bright spots undercut by Durante's irritating verbiage in their worst screen pairing. Despite his lack of creative control, the Great Stone Face provides some brilliant moments.",1334707200,6,1040,5.973154362416107
