8633758,5,B00HNGC5QG,Well comic book fans here is another comic book turned movie to add to your collection!  Maybe not a big budget block buster like Marvel & D.C. are putting out ...but still a lot of fun!  This is a good movie both for lovers of the sword & sorcery genre & the comic to movie fans. It is fast paced & full of wonderful escapist fantasy fun.  Critics may have crushed this movie but critics place way to much importance on movies...they have to or they would be out of a job!!!  I say if the price is right for you give this one a try its a nice addition to bulk up your movie library.,1479081600,,583,4.0

***AMAZON STREAMING IS IN THE ENGLISH DUB VERSION

I would actually give this movie fewer stars, but it is a B movie after all and based on a comic book hero.  So I am being generous.

This uniquely Spanish story of the Holy Grail and Prince Killian is apparently taken from one of the most popular comic book heroes in Spain.  In fact, to English viewers this cast of heroes and villains will be completely fresh.  The entire storyline is thoroughly Spanish save a few characters.

We begin with the third crusade and a remote Saracen fortress where crusader knights are being held prisoner, including two of our heroes who are sidekicks of Prince Killian (An errant knight whose family has lost their lands).  Killian shows up to save the day and free his friends along with the other crusaders.  While opening the dungeons, Killian discovers an old man who doesn't seem to be with the rest.  The old man entrusts him with a mysterious chalice and instructs him to find the Custodial Knights.  Others looking for the chalice intervene in the fight and steal the cup.

From there on, it becomes an adventure to reclaim the cup and prevent an evil and mystical rite performed by the villain Jonathan Black and his witch Ariadna.  The quest takes Killian and his companions back to his ancestral lands in Spain, which have been invaded by the evil Black (an Englishman of course!)  The mystery deepens as we try to discover who the Custodial Knights are and what Prince Killian could possibly have to do with them.  The story is much enlivened by the early introduction of a Viking Princess Sigrid of Thule who accompanies him back to Spain.

Despite the obscurity of this movie to English audiences, we apparently are familiar with several of it's stars - Sergio Mencheta (Residence Evil Afterlife), Natasha Yarovenko (Room in Rome), and Adrian Lamana (The Devil's Backbone).  Yeah, I didn't recognize them either.  However, Killian is our prototypical hero with the chiseled jaw and a steady diet of steroids.  Sigrid is very fine looking with a fighting skill to match.  The witch Ariadna reminded me a bit of a cross between Grace Jones and Jim Carey's The Grinch.  Strangely I now find the Grinch more attractive!  Seriously though, it's all just a bit of cheesy fun with the production values of maybe a 70's adventure TV show.  There is a lot of fighting with no gore.  Small amounts of slapstick here and there.  Some dark mysticism. A tiny bit of romance with no ""scenes"" or nudity.

The English dub was pretty cheesy and I thought it was poorly done at first.  I switched to Spanish and realized it was just the dialog.  However, if you are a native Spanish speaker, you will still likely prefer the Spanish language setting.  The castles and locals are those which English viewers will not be familiar with and were interesting in my opinion.  You definitely want to just rent this one if you are still interested at all.  You have to be the type that doesn't mind some B movie shmultz now and then.",1399334400,3,3154,4.68
8633763,2,B00HNGC5QG,"Baseed on the cover, Prince Killian and the Holy Grail looked like an action packed movie my six year old son would enjoy. He loves things like battles and sword fighting so this movie seemed right up his alley. Since it's not rated but says it contains violence, suggestive themes and strong language, I decided I better view it alone first!
Speaking of language, I had no idea that this was in Spanish! It's based on a Spanish comic book hero so that makes sense but I wasn't expecting the subtitles. You can watch it in English but then the voice over is pretty obvious since it's a different language. I'm not sure which is more annoying but I went for the subtitles. Clearly this eliminated Reed watching it with me but that ended up being a good thing.

I'm sure this movie in it's native tongue and traditions is a lot more entertaining than it was for me. There was some good action scenes but definitely would have been too violent for my six year old so I'm glad he didn't watch.

It's hard to judge a movie that's obviously pretty low budget when you're used to watching blockbusters so I guess this movie was entertaining enough for what it was. Probably knowing the story behind Prince Killian and being a fan of the comic book is a definite bonus!

Prine Killian and the Holy Grail is action packed and if you don't mind dubbing or subtitles then it's entertaining enough to watch, just not my cup of tea!",1398816000,2,1419,4.45
8633764,4,B00HNGC5QG,"Make sure you check the audio settings if you want to enjoy this movie in English.  Spanish is the native language and when we watched it in English, the dubbing was obvious.  The voice acting was good, it just wasn't in sync with the lip movements.  The special effects were so-so and got better as the movie progressed.  Overall this was a good movie, but it didn't have the budget of the other popular super hero movies out there.",1398816000,,433,4.443037974683544
