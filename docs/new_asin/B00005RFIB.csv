1655168,3,B00005RFIB,"This is a Good example of the Euro-Crime Thriller. Kirk Douglas plays Steve Wallace, a middle-aged ex-con trying for one last big score befores he retires. Florinda Bolkan plays his beautiful trusting wife who has waited for his return for years, but her patience is wearing thin even though her love and loyalty to her husband is unbreakable.
Italian Star, Giuliano Gemma plays the young protege who helps Wallace out in this slow paced and well told story that has the usuall downbeat offerings of many Euro-Crime thrillers along with the exciting action sequences. Indeed at times the film reminds me of Michael Mann's,""HEAT"".
Especially the character played by Robert DeNiro(Neal McCauley) who is reminiscent of the Steve Wallace character in Michele Lupo's,""The Master Touch"" - aka: A Man To Respect.
Cinematography is by the late, Tonino Delli Colli who worked with many of the great Italian Directors including Sergio Leone.
All in all this was a worthwhile purchase and St. Clair-Vision has done a nice job on this DVD transfer. The picture is a little grainy at times but didn't put off the overall enjoyment. If you like a good crime yarn,then this is the film for you.",1102809600,10,1179,4.9296482412060305

A nice surprise as it turned into a suspenseful caper thanks to the acting skills of a mature Kirk Douglas. Its full frame and a bit fuzzy, not your A-roll production budget and filmed in Hamburg, a very bland place indeed. Unfortunately in the end it turned into a predictable man-woman dramarama and left everyone with dry eyes and them with zero leaving the viewer to wonder what was the point of it all?

1655173,1,B00005RFIB,Sorry to see a wonderful actor like Kirk Douglas in a lousy film like this. How'd that happen? Cheap 70s Euro production values. Senseless violence. Creepy characters. Douglas seems be the outstanding virtue of the production. I gave up on it.,1401494400,,243,4.951219512195122

As such I cannot comment on the audio or visual quality of this Echo Bridge release.  My review is concerned with the entertainment value of the film only.

This 1972 Eurocrime heist film, starring Kirk Douglas and Guiliano Gemma, has Douglas, as safecracker Steve Wallace, newly released from jail but already tempted to commit one last robbery which will set him up for retirement.  Florinda Bolkan, as his attractive wife Anna, has already waited three long years for him to come back to her, and who doesn't think she can stand the risk of waiting again.  But to pull of this last score, Wallace will need her help, as well as that of his accomplice Gemma...and if everyone does their part, there's nothing to worry about, right?

Well, no one's re-inventing the wheel with this flick, but I thought it was pretty  enjoyable for what it was.  I'm sure part of my enthusiasm stems from the fact that my expections were fairly low to begin with.  Douglas is solid as usual, and the script is well above average for these types of films - but it is firmly rooted in its time, both by the safe-cracking tools Douglas uses and in the way the film is shot.  That last bit sort of inspires a bit of nostalgia, but it doesn't get in the way of the story, nor is it so cornily out of date that it turns into a comedy rather than a suspense film.

There is also an extended fight sequence/car chase in the film that seemed to last about twenty minutes - it reminded me most of the Family Guy episodes where Peter and his arch-enemy the Chicken have epic battles ranging over the entire city.  Along with the suspense of the heist itself and it's rather dramatic ending, the different elements come together for a film that I thought remains fresh even today - perhaps even charmingly unconventional, given the sameness of many modern action films.  Although I did not find it so, some viewers may think it slow in spots - I just thought it was reasonable rather than hyperactive.

Worth checking out to Eurocrime enthusiasts as well as those looking for something a little offbeat in their action film.  One of those nice, unexpected surprises tucked into a compilation disc of older genre films.  Four Stars.

This full screen Pop Flix transfer is somewhat grainy, especially during the title sequence, but serviceable.  The version from Echo Bridge is listed at 1.33:1 aspect ratio, so if you've been looking for this film in 16x9, here's your chance.

This was better than I expected. Kirk does a pretty fine job of playing the safe cracker just out of jail and going for one last big score (now there's a plot we've all seen a few times).

Well shot in Hamburg, this flick was made for the Euro market and I guess that's why this is the first review of this film here. Apart from a solid script with minimal histrionics and good enough supporting actors, the highlight is one of the best car chases you've never heard of. No gimmicks, etc, just a Bullitt-style effect-free real car chase shot in real time that's a nice little intro to the streets and docks of Hamburg. If you like car chases, you'll love this one.

While no work of genius, The Master Touch is a classic early-70s-looking film, which is something I love. Directors weren't afraid to be realistic and rather noir for a while there in the Vietnam/Watergate days, which adds that believable grit that's so missing from Hoolywood films now. Sometimes low budgets have their compensations.

An above-average heist flick, slow but well done in most every way, and worth watching for fans of the genre, Kirk, and/or Hamburg.",1247443200,6,1146,4.630541871921182
1655178,3,B00005RFIB,"Released from prison, Steve (Kirk Douglas) is tempted to perform one last seemingly impossible heist. Eschewing the offer from notorious gangsters, he pairs up with an agile trapeze artist met in a street fight and plans a concurrent FOOLPROOF alibi and perfect crime. Unfortunately, fools are involved which leads to three brutal fights, one exhaustive car chase, and more than one vendetta to be settled -- leaving Steve to wonder if the effort was equal to the potential payoff. Be careful about making friends with acquaintances met in an alley.

Caveats: Image of this made-for-TV production is VHS quality on the DVD. There may be too much violence for some families.",1141689600,8,673,5.063063063063063

7952182,5,B00005RFIB,"When I saw the black & white display picture with Kirk Douglas, I thought I was in for a predictable early 1960's Hollywood-style caper film. What I got was an Italian grainy, blotchy-color film shot in typical Italian style with tight close-ups, hard edit cuts, paced a bit slow in places. But when the actors' spoke English, their lips moved in English too.

Having said all that -- it is well researched and the screenwriter did a good job with the ebb and flow of tension, as well as adding little nuances throughout which added to the complexity of the characters. I really didn't know who would emerge victorious -- if anyone at all -- until the very end of the film.

I found the following hard to believe:
1) the goon who was after Marco ... did not tip off his boss of what seemed afoot? And absolutely no retribution from the crime boss?
2) for so important a job, would Steve really allow novice Marco to handle such a tricky part?
3) the extended car chase was pretty unbelievable; American automotive products were just not that durable, even back then (in fact, the ongoing struggle between the goon and Marco seemed an add-on, as if someone in development had said, ""We need to add some pages to the script, let's kill off the goon with a car chase"")
4) just how did Marco manage to get the circus lion from its cage and into the car, to confront the goon?

But it was a fun film ride nonetheless. Thoroughly entertaining in a grainy, blotchy-color time-capsule sort of way.  I had a great time viewing it. I recommend THE MASTER TOUCH.",1435449600,,1551,4.48936170212766
