7966259,5,B00006ADDV,"I ordered this DVD and didn't pay shipping and it got to my house in less then 3 days. The movie it self isn't great or anything, I had just seen a portion of it when I was a kid and always wanted to see the whole thing. My high rating of this is due to the speedy delivery and the fact that the DVD it self only cost $5.",1342310400,,321,3.6
7966260,1,B00006ADDV,"This item seems to be an attempt to use the title of ""The Keep"", a 1983 movie with Scott Glenn, directed by Michael Mann, to mislead you into buying this excruciatingly bad film.  ""The Keep"", sad to say, was only released on VHS and is very rare.  This is not it.  Also beware of sites claiming to have ""The Keep"", on DVD.  There was never an official release of ""The Keep"", on DVD.  The DVD's being offered are all pirate copies and VERY badly done, not to mention illegal.  I just threw one away (I had hoped it was the real thing).  Alas, for some reason ""The Keep"", despite its cult status, has never been released in any other format than VHS and maybe BetaMax.  I sure do wish it would happen since thousands of lesser films are on DVD, but not this one.  Someone is certainly a fool not to do so.",1257724800,,803,4.196078431372549

Nazis commandeer a Keep of religious significance , while stealing silver cruxifixes hell is unleashed. Not this flick but THE KEEP.

7966262,1,B00006ADDV,"Who is this confused individual from Florida calling this turkey a masterpiece?  Maybe the ""director"" lives in Florida?  This film is a prime candidate for Mystery Science Theatre.  Laughable on all aspects, it can only be called a modern day Ed Wood Film.  The music score takes it down even more notches.",1045612800,5,306,4.826923076923077
