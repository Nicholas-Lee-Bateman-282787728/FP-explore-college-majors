8745993,2,B019S27ZFI,"Gangs of New York, 2003 film

A man talks to his son. A group forms and marches out of the Old Brewery in the Five Points district of New York city. [The streets seem strangely deserted.] They use the names of early Gangs of New York. The bloody battle continues until a horn sounds. ""My sympathies."" [Was there such a large open plaza?] Sixteen years later the young boy is grown up and released from an institution. The date seems to be 1863. Coffins are unloaded from ships. William Marcy Tweed schemes to improve the city and his fortune. We hear the names of the various gangs. [Did people walk outside without hats?] Amateur fire companies fought for the profit of putting out a fire. [The efficiency of private business?]

Amsterdam visits Butcher Bill's hangout. They attempt to rob a ship, and sell a dead body for medical science. There is a test for Amsterdam. They show the various methods of thefts by the crooks of that day. Criminality is rampant in the Five Points. [Caused by poverty or oppression?] they make an example of some men for a public hanging. Army recruits climb onto a ship while coffins are landed on the dock. Somebody shoots Butcher Bill. [Does this film have a plot or just a collection of scenes?] Amsterdam has a tender minute with Jenny. Does fear preserve the order of things? [Do the conversations make much sense?] ""Who are you?"" Will someone peach?

 Butcher Bill shows his knife-throwing skills. There is a shocking surprise and a gruesome and revolting scene. Who killed a poor little rabbit? [Does the story make sense?] Will there be a grand fight to provide an exciting finish? William Marcy Tweed seeks votes in the Five Points. Voters are recruited; its not the ballots that count but the count of the vote. [Is the violence almost cartoonish? Does the film start to drag?] Now the tempo picks up when the mob attacks people and buildings. The army clear the mob from the streets, the navy bombards the people in the plaza. There is one last meeting for Butcher Bill and Amsterdam. [This movie doesn't have a good ending, was something cut out?]

The last scene shows the Brooklyn Bridge which didn't exist until years after 1863. This film was loosely based on Herbert Asbury's 1925 book. You may find the book ""Low Life"" by Luc Sante to be more informative and interesting. The Discovery Channel had a good film on the Five Points. It explains that ""Dead Rabbits"" meant ""real tough guys"" (Gaelic ribad). Fire was the chief danger in those days (candles, fireplaces). These stories tell little about the economic situations. The gangs here can explain the turmoil in some Middle East countries today. Does anyone believe corruption ended with Boss Tweed? Some say Federal, state, and municipal projects today don't get funded unless somebody gets paid. You can compare this to many business projects.",1505433600,,2849,4.77079107505071
