2240600,5,B0007TFICE,"The world heads to the Bolshoi, but the Kirov seem to be ahead of the game in recent years. Osipova's defection to Peterburg has given them a further boost",1362873600,,155,4.379310344827586
2240601,4,B0007TFICE,"I've seen Corsaire enough times to know that this is a dance extravaganza rather than high art. In past encounters I never paid much attention to the music or the plot because Nureyev or some other extravagantly good danseur was performing and you paid little attention to plot or music. In this case the men are somewhat lackluster though the women are superb. Thus I paid attention to the music; good greif! Five composers (A.Adam,C. Pugni, L. Delibes, R. Drigo & P. Oldenbourg) of varied styles and talent and from various periods of time are incorporated into this ""hasty pudding"" of a score. No wonder there is no cohesion or plot line. The story from Lord Byron beautiful poem is unrecognizable but at least when used by Verdi in his opera ""La Corsair"" is artistically valid, Le Corsaire is not. Why then does it still hold the stage? As demonstrated in this production it can have dazzling dancing. And the ladies are dazzling! Altynai Asylmuratova as Medora and especially the Gulnara of Yelena Pankova are stunning. As one reviwer said - as soon as it's over you want to play it again. In addition to their great technique they also convey emotion and desire. I was overjoyed by their performances. Even the odelesques ladies with only brief things to do were beautiful to watch. The slave, Ali was the only male that seemed to be inspired and his dancing was fine. Unfortunately the sets and curtains were somewhat tattered and shopworn and the costumes were bargain basement. The concerted numbers especially in the Seid Pasha Harem with all the falling apart ostrich plumes looked like a rehash of Busby Berkeley's ""Footlight Parade"" or ""42nd Street"" and the music was just as bad.",1344643200,2,1693,4.801369863013699
2240602,5,B0007TFICE,"An outstanding performance by the Kirov Ballet Company of an established favorite. As was described in a CD named ""Theater Street"", which was narrated by Grace Kelly, the Kirov has what may be the most rigorous selection and training program of any ballet company in the world.

A non-related, but possibly interesting, fact:  The Kirov was named for Sergey Kirov, who was appointed by Joseph Stalin to a position that was the equivalent of mayor of Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). Kirov was quite effective in that position, and was immensely popular among his constituents. Many Soviet leaders considered Kirov to be a logical successor to Stalin.  Kirov was murdered in December, 1934 under circumstances that strongly suggest that the murder was ordered by Stalin.  A generally accepted explanation for the murder is that Kirov was becoming too popular to suit Stalin.",1330992000,5,872,5.163120567375887
2240603,5,B0007TFICE,"It was absolutely wonderful.  It's such a pleasure to enjoy real ballet in American through this historical production of the famous ballet.

I recommend this to all ballet fans, and to all who wish to expand their culture knowledge.

2240604,5,B0007TFICE,"This is a very satisfying version of Le Corsaire.  ALL the dancers, from the principals to the corp de ballet, are excellent. The principals show, not only great virtuosity, but expression of the feelings required by the parts they ""play."" They act as well as dance.
 The story may be foolish, but then, most ballet stories are, only the dancers, if they enter into their roles, can make you believe it, and this version does just that.
I highly recommend it.",1279929600,5,459,4.654320987654321
2240605,4,B0007TFICE,"Had I written this review 10 years ago, I would have given it the full five stars. The masters of this DVD could have actually re-processed it a bit to make it a little clearer. Just pure laziness and a 'take it or leave it' attitude I guess.
This performance has just about every mark of greatness of execution that can ever be expected. Seeing Asylmuratova and Pankova together.... that is what great stuff is made of. Music has been performed quite well and given the fact that it was recorded eons ago,very very acceptable recording.

I know people have gone gaga over Ruzimatov. Frankly, he just doesn't compare well enough with ever so many others. In fact the old tape of Rudolph Nureyev dancing the slave dance is about the ultimate one can think in terms of this. I have seen another recording of Ruzimatov's performance in London of the same stuff in the Makarova's first reunion with the Kirov with practically the same cast. Ruzimatov has this totally unacceptable expression on his face as though he troubled by a nasty smell all the time. Just observe it next time you watch it..

There is only that much you can do with this ballet, and I don't think I shall BUY another even if it comes out in High Definition and wide screen, UNLESS the newbies come up to Asylmuratova/Pankova standards. The men other than Ali don't have too much to do anyway, with the exception of that one slave dance, which has so far never matched the old Nureyev recording. Not to my knowledge.",1270166400,6,1484,4.575187969924812
2240606,5,B0007TFICE,"If like us you love the Music of Adam and the choreography of Petipa then add to it the magic of the Kirov in the 1980,s then this is for you.",1211673600,3,142,3.6129032258064515
2240607,4,B0007TFICE,The quality of film is not great - colors go in and out.  Interesting production - very different from ABT in many places - dancing is great though - worth ordering for comparison purposes but if you just want one Le Corsaire with good quality on the reproduction end go for ABT's.,1167955200,4,281,4.403846153846154
2240608,4,B0007TFICE,"The worst thing about this DVD is that it's in letterbox format (4:3).

The quality of the video is pretty good.  It should look pretty good on a conventional TV, but it's okay even with a HD TV.

The quality of the dancing is quite good as well.

It's not the most recent production, so people who know ballet may feel that the costumes, lighting, and the set are not the most up to date style.  But this would be a good DVD to keep in your ballet DVD collection.

But I still like the ABT version of Le Corsaire better.",1130889600,9,521,4.108910891089109
2240609,5,B0007TFICE,"I have seen no less than three Corsaire's now in different productions and this is easily the best.  The dancing is absolutely superb, the costuming and sets are beautiful and the whole production is a joy.

Although Pankova is my favourite of the Kirov dancers and she is beautiful as Gulnara, I loved Asylmuratova in this performance and the whole company's performance sparkled throughout.  The production is exciting and never flags for a second, and you're on the edge of your seat the whole time waiting for the next piece of fantastic dancing, to the point that you want to watch it all over again when it's finished.  The section entitled Le Jardin Anime is particularly lovely and the Pas de Trois which was made famous as a Pas de Deux by Fonteyne and Nureyev is also wonderful.

Buy this.  I can't recommend it too highly.",1117584000,57,833,4.671232876712328

8051227,3,B0007TFICE,"The advertised product is a ""KIROV BALLET production of Le Corsaire"".  Notice that some of the reviewers refer to an ""AMERICAN BALLET"" production of Le Corsaire.  The 'reviews' of two performances and separate DVD's seem to be conflated.  AMAZON seems to be very sloppy in this regard.  Just for your information.  AS one has to check a 'rating' I am giving it a 3 star so as not to be positive or negative.  I have not seen the dvd of either the KIROV or the AMERICAN BALLET performance.",1433635200,4,488,4.488636363636363
8051228,2,B0007TFICE,"Good dancing and music, but the resolution was so low and grainy that it was like watching an old TV in 1955",1425513600,2,108,3.9545454545454546
8051229,5,B0007TFICE,Also wonderful. No problems.,1408579200,,28,6.25
8051230,5,B0007TFICE,"A marvelous performance. My one reservation was that the picture seemed ever so slightly out of focus. This performance occurred, I believe, back in the eighties when video quality was still rather primitive compared to today. I'd love to see this remade today with the same performers, but their knees and feet are probably shot!",1398124800,,330,5.0181818181818185
8051231,1,B0007TFICE,"It has been a while since I saw old choreography, but this is it.  Some of it is so funny, it is unwatchable.
More to the point is the fact that the quality of the DVD is very poor.  It looks more like the recording was made about 30 years ago and not improved for DVD.  I do NOT recommend spending money on this disc.
By the way, some,at least of the 5 star reviews for this DVD are NOT for this DVD, but are for the American Ballet Theater DVD.",1388880000,3,446,3.879120879120879
8051232,5,B0007TFICE,"The DVD arrived on time and in good condition. This ballet has two of my favorite dancers - Farouk Ruzimatov and Yelena Pankova. The production is professional through out with good camera work and quality sound. The Kirov is one of, if not the best ballet company in the world and this video shows it at its best. Thoroughly enjoyable.",1388534400,,336,4.616666666666666
8051233,5,B0007TFICE,"An excellent ballet with beautiful scenery and costumes, and an exciting plot, involving sailors shipwrecked during a storm and a slave market.  Great music and dancing.",1365465600,,169,5.5
