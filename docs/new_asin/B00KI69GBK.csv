8659199,5,B00KI69GBK,"A bold subject to approach, Californication takes on the lives of 4 hipster adults (and a vast ancillary cast of their friends) while focusing namely on Hank, the main character. Hank is an on again, off again writer of book and film. His innocent charm (and his constant downfall) is his uncanny ability to step into situations that not only adversely affect the lives of others around him, but also compromises his relationship with the mother of his child. This description is intentionally vague because it is important to note that the immediacy of any scene can be either distracting or multi-layered, both intentionally. I caution the viewer not to get hung up on the sex scenes but to look more at the circumstances of the moment. Those ""moments"" are what define the characters and the assured relationships you will grow to embrace with these characters. Splendidly written, an exemplary cast, and a great backdrop of music throughout the series. Watch these characters grow across 7 seasons and you will not walk away with dry eyes.",1419120000,,1042,4.926136363636363
