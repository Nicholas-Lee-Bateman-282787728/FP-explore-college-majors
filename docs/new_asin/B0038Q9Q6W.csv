4091971,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"Funimation is still getting these sets out for fans who don't already own the series uncut or fans who may have purchased their old sets but don't mind double dipping for these well done sets that line up so nicely on the shelf, especially alongside the orange Dragon Ball Z season sets. This 5-disc fourth 'season' set of Dragon Ball will contain the following 30 episodes from 2 sagas:

116 A Taste of Destiny
117 The Ultimate Sacrifice
118 Prelude to Vengeance
119 Battle Cry
120 Goku Strikes Back
121 The Biggest Crisis
122 Final Showdown

All these episodes are presented in remastered editions of their original full frame (4:3 Aspect Ratio) format. Audio has English or Japanese voice track options and the original Japanese musical score in 5.1 Surround. As is standard with these sets there will be no special features other than previews for other Funimation products and textless songs, so don't expect to find any here.

These episodes are where Dragon Ball begins to move toward a close, thus everything is ratcheted up. We get the World Martial Arts Tournament showdown between Goku and Tien which is pure epic Dragon Ball, then no sooner does that end and everyone start to relax before Goku must face the death of one of his closest friends. King Piccolo and his henchmen, all named after instruments, arrive on the scene and Goku faces bigger stakes than ever before. There are several deaths of key characters and we also first meet Yajirobe, who Dragon Ball Z fans will be familiar with as a comic relief coward, only here he is the slightest bit more noble and willing to help fight. Once again it will all come down to who can find the dragon balls first.

Once this set is released we're only waiting on the fifth season set to bring us the final 31 episodes. Goku and his friends will face a greater threat in the form of Piccolo Jr, the one we all know from DBZ, and thus Goku will recieve some special training from someone who will become a DBZ permanent fixture. Everyone will grow a bit older and become young adults, but poor Krillin won't grow much taller. A jaded friend from Goku's past will return to settle a score and all of this happens at another World Martial Arts Tournament. As if that's not enough there will be a wedding and one final quest before it can get underway, Goku must face his past demons. The final set is a great way to bring a close to the Dragon Ball story and bring us right back to where Dragon Ball Z begins, which is the spot most of us first came to know these wonderful characters. Thanks for your time.",1266710400,81,3120,4.580645161290323

When i came across Dragon Ball i instantly fell in love with this anime. Now I purchased seasons 1-5 to have all the episodes as part of my collection. I really like the booklet the DVD'S are inserted in and the slip cover is very nice as well. The audio is really good. I definitely recommend Dragon Ball to anyone whether you are new to anime or not. I've got to say this is a great gateway in order to get into other anime's. Great blend of action and comedy.

4092037,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"To start off, even if you've seen all of the secondary series DragonBall Z, but you haven't watched that much of DragonBall where the series started out, you are missing out by not seeing the episodes in DragonBall.  Even if you read online about the Sagas of DragonBall, it still won't work as well if you don't watch the episodes.  I'm telling you fans of DragonBall Z, believe me you are missing out if you don't see the episodes of DragonBall.  Though, you won't be missing out if you don't watch DragonBall G.T.

Let me first summarize the noticeable differences between DragonBall and DragonBall Z.  For one in most of DragonBall, Goku is a kid.  Another difference is the background music in DragonBall is not Bruce Faulconer's, but the original music from the series.  There are also differences like seeing more animal people in DragonBall.  We also don't know what a Saiyan is in DragonBall or any other Saiyan characters besides Goku, when Saiyans were the main focus throughout DragonBall Z.  Saiyans and their various transformations and how most of the non-saiyan characters besides Piccolo could not keep up with the Saiyans and their Super-Saiyan transformations.  In this series, we know most of the characters we know in DragonBall Z that aren't Saiyans.  We even get to know Launch who was a main character in DragonBall, but a forgotten character in DragonBall Z.  Goku's power was comparable to Master Roshi's in DragonBall.  That being said, the world tournament is more a part of the story in DragonBall than DragonBall Z.  DragonBall seems to deal more with the story and finding the DragonBalls, while DragonBall Z seems more about the combat.

Now continuing, one of the things that I think is one of the main success factors of DragonBall as a whole and even how I got involved with the series.  DragonBall Z is like a Soap Opera/Telenovela.  Not like we're watching a daytime Soap Opera, but the fact that DragonBall Z is a continuous storyline where each episode begins where the last one left off, and the episodes normally end at exciting parts.  Some people don't watch Soap Operas just because they feel like they'll get hooked on the series always having to find out what happens next?

Now, to talk a little more briefly about the success of DragonBall when it doesn't include Super Saiyans or Vegeta.  Season 2 of DragonBall which has the most reviews so it's probably the most popular, includes the Red Ribbon Army.  The Red Ribbon Army is portrayed differently in DragonBall than they are in DragonBall Z, almost as if it wasn't part of the main storyline.  There's no mention of Dr. Gero in DragonBall.  It's hard to believe that one of their scientists could create something more powerful than Frieza.  However, the Red Ribbon Army as an organization is quite impressive even by today's standards.  The Red Ribbon Army episodes aired almost 30-years ago in Japan and the technology they have, is still impressive today.  The Red Ribbon Army Saga didn't end at Season 2 making you want to buy Season 3 to find out what happens next?

Season 3 also did not end after the World Tournament Saga, making you want to buy Season 4 to find out what happens next at the World Tournament, when Master Roshi and Tien were way better fighters.  Then, we get introduced to King Piccolo.  If we watch DragonBall Z, we're all familiar with Piccolo but a lot of us aren't familiar with King Piccolo.  This Saga is awesome and seems to start showing the typical action we're used to seeing in DragonBall Z.  Season 4 also ends at a good time at the end of the King Piccolo Saga, and not in the middle of a Saga.

Looking at the most bought Season episodes, I'm guessing the number of comments indicate the most bought.  It would seem like with DragonBall, Season 2 is the most bought.  In DragonBall Z, Season 3 is possibly the most bought.  Those were the Frieza Saga episodes, and it seems like Frieza was the preferred villain to a lot of D.B.Z. fans.  These disks are awesome to buy, especially for DragonBall Z fans.  I read a joke on the internet that said money can't buy happiness but it can buy episodes of DragonBall Z which comes pretty close.  I just wish these episodes would come with the booklets like they used to, and would almost give it a 4 for not coming with the booklets.  But, these episodes are too entertaining I'd give it a 5.

In all, if you're a fan I'd strongly recommend you watch the King Piccolo Saga, because I can guarantee you'd most likely enjoy it.",1452816000,,4509,4.658227848101266

No booklet for the episodes but with kanzenshuu.com's episode lists, it really didn't matter that much. It your a fan of the original Japanese version, heads up as the episodes titles are in still in English even when you change it to the original Japanese language track. This was not the case on the early 2000s volumes nor any DBZ DVDs I own. I guess because of the remastering? It's highly recommended you watch these on a Blu-ray player to get the best picture. The remastering added sort of a upscaling and masking to the grain and imperfections of the original 16mm film and add the Blu-ray upscaling and you forget you're watching something that was made in the late 1980s. This DVD set includes episodes 93-122. It starts with the 2nd half of the Tenshinhan Saga (22nd Tenkaichi Budoukai) and all of Piccolo Daimao. For the record: DB nor DBZ had ""seasons"" nor ""sagas"" just story arcs.",1434585600,,1069,4.602094240837697
4092063,4,B0038Q9Q6W,"*Spoiler ahead*
Season 4 takes us to the 2nd half of the Tenshinhan Saga. It starts off with Jackie Chun vs. Tenshinhan and ends with an intense battle between Goku and Tenshinhan. But then we witness what becomes the change in series tone. What was a happy and humorous show then becomes dark and serious. Enter Piccolo Daimao. Dragon Ball's first true villian. So evil and so sadistic as we witness the series first main character death. We see an angry Goku so full of rage and vengeance. Brutal and intense fights. Season 4 has it all...
....or so I thought.
Though the show itself deserves 5 stars I had to give it 4. Why? As a hardcore fan I wanted something close to the full experience. I wanted to feel what it was like watching the show I love as it first aired. Fine, no episode previews. I could live with that. The things that really disappointed me were the text in the opening, episode title and ending. Yes, I know the subtitles are in Japanese if you set them that way, but everything else stays in English. For example, if you set it to Japanese audio with English subs, the credits still come out in English. It's only the song lyrics that appear. In the Dragon Ball Z season box sets if those same options are applied then we get Japanese text and lyrics. Also another disappointment is that the 2nd opening and 3rd ending are not used. Funimation decided not to include them for some reason. In the 2nd opening we see a young Goku with his orange gi instead of blue. We see him flying in the sky with his kinto-un. We see glimpses of Kuririn, Tenshinhan, Chaozu, Yajirobe and even Piccolo Daimao alongside Piano. The 3rd ending starts off the same as the first two. We see Karin, Yajirobe and Goku on a motorcycle, and a cool picture of the entire gang in front of Kame House.
Overall it's a great season to have, watch and enjoy. It's full of suspense and action packed. Just wish Funimation would have done something about the texts and opening/ending. Guess we'll have to wait for a re-release in the future.",1433635200,,2032,4.46505376344086

and if your buying them for yourself that's great too this is the #1 anime and a lot of people over 18yrs of age are obsessed with it. ive bought all the seasons and watched them atleast 5 times through in the past 3 years and they still work fine.

the only problems that I have had are I didn't get the booklet for seasons 1 and 2 but you won't need them anyways and the other problem I have encountered is that the part that holds the discs a few of them have been broken and the disc will fall out of place at random which may lead to me dropping it on a hard floor or misplacing it but other then those its perfect.",1419033600,,833,4.0120481927710845

4092146,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"Picking up where the last season left off, the 22nd World Martial Arts Tournament continues.  And it is excellent.  My favorite was the last fight, with Tien & Goku.  But then the story takes a dark turn when King Piccolo shows up.  It's definitely one of the darkest DB stories ever, with several characters we've grown to love getting killed by Piccolo & his minions.  Despite the fact I'd seen most of Z before seeing this it was still horrible to watch.  The episodes with Piccolo were the ones I most wanted to see when I first heard about Dragonball; watching how one of my favorite characters in Z started off evil but eventually turned good.  This wasn't what I expected it would be like, but it gets that way during the next season.  Anyways, the Piccolo Saga is the best saga in the original Dragonball, apart from the Red Ribbon Army & the 23rd World Martial Arts Tournament sagas.  One of the best things about this season is there's no nudity or toilet humor.  There will be a little bit in the next season but it's much tamer than in the previous seasons.

4092164,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"Being a big fan of Dragon Ball (Original, Z and GT) I used to watch it all the time as a kid. Unfortunately my parents had cancelled our cable before I ever got see all of Dragon Ball, I had seen all of Z due to Funimation's bass ackwards decision to release Dragon Ball Z and do Dragon Ball after it had finished. Anyway back during the days of watching it on Cartoon Network I had seen all the way up to Goku's fight with Tien (the start of this 4th season), the last episode specifically being the one in which Tien grew 2 extra arms to fight Goku...never had seen the outcome of the fight. After hearing Funimation had finally acquired the distribution rights for it and was planning a 5 Season box release, similar to Z's only not 16:9 widescreen and not ""HD"" like the Z boxes claim to be, still I was pretty happy to know I could finally see how it all turned out.

This season had what is easily the most epic story from ALL of DB including Z and GT. To sum it up without spoiling too much, Emperor Pilaf and his lackeys Shu & Mai found Demon King Piccolo who, decades before, had been trapped in an electric rice cooker by master Mutaito using the Evil Containment Wave. Not knowing what terror they had unleashed (or perhaps following his wishes out of fear) they aided him on a quest to find the Dragon Balls. This of course led to confrontations with Gpku and the others. In Piccolo's quest to conquer the earth he creates several monsters and tasks them with killing any and all martial artists in the world as well as securing the Dragon Balls for him, this is when the epicness really begins because, for only the second time, does Goku face off with an enemy that proves more that a challenge for him. The fights are spectacular, the storyline is very well planned out and just a very big and ambitious one at that and the growth of Goku's character becomes more and more apparent as the story goes.

I highly recommend this season to all Dragon Ball fans, Dragon Ball as a whole is the perfect starting point for anyone curios about anime but not sure where to start.",1354492800,,2083,4.338461538461538

Can Goku and the others find a way to save the planet from this evil tyrant? This is some of my favorite Dragonball. Dragonball is lots of fun and a must see for all anime fans. I love that they have remastered this old series. The audio is in 5.1 Dolby Digital surround. It sounds great.

I was amazed of how well the stories are yet they still know how to draw or stretch them out tile the next episodes.  I guess this is where they learned how to do just that since this was before Dragon Ball Z. The season came as promised undamaged and in new conditions.

Cons: Go ahead and buy the next season cause when you finish one you don't have to wait tile your next season to get here, like we are going to have to do, to see what happens next:) Not a Con per say but I want to know what happens in season 5 like now!!!!

4092181,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"Season 4 of dragon ball begins with Master Roshi's battle with Tien Shinhan but after the tournament saga we shift gears to the main plot of this epic, King Piccolo. With Krillin (Goku's best friend) murdered, Goku embarks on journey of revenge along which we meet many new characters and eventually leading up to the final confrontation of Goku and King Piccolo . If you are watching Dragon Ball as a prequel to DBZ this saga is a must. Not to mention it is just down right a good story. Quality is great, offers both English and Japanese audio and subtitles.

I was at the Dr. office and almost missed that appointment just so I wouldn't miss seeing Dragon Ball. The whole 5 volume DB series is a real kick and fills in what the later Dragonball Z expands on. I've watched the whole series, 3 times. I never get tired of watching Goku, Rossi, Kurrin and Bulma go on their adventures.
if you liked any of the Dragon Ball series, give the first series a watch.

King piccolo wants to take over earth and on top of that he killed goku's best friends so it's payback time. goku must learn how to fight not physically but mentally as well to take on a villian as strong as king piccolo. For people just gettint tuned on to this this is a great anime to watch and you will have fun watching it too. a must have for the collection.,1299283200,,530,3.9166666666666665
4092184,3,B0038Q9Q6W,"The Dragon Ball Season Four DVD box set includes five DVDs that contain thirty episodes.  The first four discs contain seven episodes, and the fifth disc contains two episodes and the DVD extras.  The focus of this set is the conclusion of the Tenkaichi Tournament and King Piccolo's attempt to take over the world.

On the main menu of the first four discs, you can choose to watch all the episodes, watch the disc with the marathon feature, choose which episode you want to watch, and set up your language and subtitle options.  One of the best features of this set is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  In the setup menu, you can choose between English and Japanese audio.  You can also choose to turn the subtitles on and off.

The menu on the fifth DVD adds in a link for the special features.  However, the features aren't very special.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (which are the same as what appeared on the first three DVD box sets), and trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for Tsubasa, S.A.V.E., xxxHOLiC, Heroic Age, The Slayers, Soul Eater, Ah! My Goddess, and Dragon Ball.

Overall, the episodes that appeared on this set are rather decent.  My biggest disappointment with this set was how FUNimation decided to split the episodes between discs.  Instead of trying to divide the episodes out a little more evenly between discs, they decided to cram as many episodes as they could on the early discs in the set, and only placing two episodes on the final disc.  To me, this breakdown just makes absolutely no sense.  It would have made more sense to put six episodes onto each disc, and tacking what little bonus features there are on the final disc.

While I'm a little disappointed by the episode breakdown of the discs and by the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball fans that want to own the series on DVD.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1298937600,2,2193,4.565217391304348
4092185,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"Thank you for the great quality and cover. Could not have asked for more. I have in the past tried to get this video at 3 different times. I ordered the series 1-5 but 4 seemed almost impossible to get. It was to be the series 1-5 (NO 4) for X-mas. So I gave it to my husband for his b-day.
Thanks. Kathleen",1297123200,,307,3.888888888888889
4092186,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"As Goku steps into the ring at the World Martial Arts Tournament against Tien Shinhan, little does he know that his world is about to get even bigger.  As he dukes it out with Tien there is a dark cloud looming over the world, darker than Goku can even begin to fathom. That dark cloud is in the form of a ruthless tyrant named King Piccolo. Piccolo is the strongest being on the planet and even with the discovery of the Dragon Balls, his goal is not world domination. Rather, his goal is to destroy every human being on the planet. Now with Tien and Chiatzou as strong allies with some new friends by his side, Goku is about to face Piccolo head on. The only thing here is Goku is not going into this fight with the mindset of saving world alone. This time it is something much, much more.

While I was enjoying watching Dragon Ball, this is the point of the Dragon Ball story line that was truly looking forward to the most. The show has so many positives when it reaches this point. One of the big positives is the mood of the show and how quickly it shifts from light hearted and funny, to dramatic and dark. Granted, there are still funny moments especially seen through the pudgy mountain man Yajerobe, but still when Piccolo makes his appearance even Master Roshi, gets serious. The dramatic elements are used so well and I had not seen so much emotion in the characters since season eight of Dragon Ball Z. It all stems from that one moment at the end of the Tien Shinhan saga that sets the pace for the rest of the 4th season. I don't want to give it away, but if you are a DBZ fan this point in time is actually mentioned in the Vegeta saga by Goku and it was a moment that I was really looking forward to seeing.

Now there is one more season of Dragon Ball to explore, and I am looking forward to seeing Goku finally making the change from Boy to Man and paving the way for the adventures that will follow in Dragon Ball Z.",1291939200,9,1936,4.227027027027027
4092187,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"Straight up, this is probably the best saga of the DB series, I hate the way there collecting the episodes in these sets though, leaving you with cliffhangers so that youll be forced to buy the next set, but this season in particular is well worth it, the King piccollo saga is in many ways my favorite story arc of all of them, including the DBZ and DBGT series arcs, theres many reasons I can tell why, but in short Its possibly the hardest and most important challenge/battle that goku must face. King piccolo is one of my all time favorite villians and It sucks that they never brought him back from the dead to fight with goku, or even piccolo jr.(Now that would have been a sight). But if you're a DB, DBZ, OR DBGT fan and are making an effort to collect the best of this fantastic show, you should definitely make this a priority on your quest my friend. 5 STARS *****",1291766400,,875,4.3090909090909095
4092188,4,B0038Q9Q6W,"This is the first saga in the Dragonball franchise that actually has a decently interesting and somewhat well put together story about the rival martial arts dojos. Piccolo is a very interesting villain, although much of his back story isn't completely explained until the next season. I am a big fan of the series and this is one of my personal favorite sagas. The confrontations are tense, and it makes for a nice cliffhanger ending.",1290556800,,435,4.8133333333333335
4092189,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"This is probably the better season boxset out of the Dragonball seasons. It contains the rest of the Tien Shinhan saga and the entire King Piccolo saga. The King Piccolo saga is probably the most interesting and action packed of the lot.
The thing I like about the martial arts tournaments in Dragonball, is that they show the entire thing from start to finish and don't show it halfway through because the Z fighters have to fight a battle elsewhere like fighting Majin Buu after the tournament.
The final match between Goku and Tien Shinhan was great! It had everything from a brutal hand to hand combat and a mid air fight.

Also I would have chosen the image of Tien from DBZ Season 1 of the Hero section in the booklet for the front cover. This is probably the only season where Tien actually deserves to be on the front cover because of Tien's disagreement with Master Shen, which leads to him and Chiatozu leaving the Crane school forever, also Master Roshi's words of wisdom to help Tien change his violent ways and become a hero, Tien changes his ways and atones for past deeds and when he took it upon himself to learn and master the Evil Containment Wave and was willing enough to use it against King Piccolo in exchange for his own life. That's why this season deserves Tien Shinhan on the front cover.
But since the cover shot is of King Piccolo, he represents the bad guys who have managed to appear on the front covers like in DBZ with Frieza and Cell.

When Goku and the others go out for dinner and Krillin wants to retrieve Goku's power pole and dragonball, I had a feeling (just like Goku felt) that this is Krillin's last moments. Although I wasn't sadden by the death but I was in shock in the lead up to Goku finding Krillin's body.
During Tambourine's killing spree of the tournament fighters, I was a little disheartened when Tambourine found Bacterian, although he is the most disgusting but he didn't deserve to die the way he did, and that goes the same with the others.
When Tambourine destroys Goku's Flying Nimbus, I remembered one of the villagers in Suno's village said a Flying Nimbus can't be destroyed.

I first thought Kami first appeared in the King Piccolo saga (Season 4), however I was mistaken. I now know he first appears in Dragonball Season 5. Although, Kami and Mr Popo would have definitely been around during Seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4 but never shown.

Out of the 2 guardians that have appeared during the Dragonball series, Kami appears in 5 seasons, ranging from Dragonball Season 5, DBZ Season 1, he misses out in Season 2 (being dead), comes back in Season 3 & 4 and then merges with Piccolo in DBZ Season 5. Kami also plays a constant part in the DBZ movie `Dead Zone'.
While Dende first appears in DBZ Season 6, and continues with Season 7, 8 and 9, he returns in Dragonball GT in Seasons 1 & 2. Dende appears briefly in the DBZ movie `Return Of Cooler'. In total he appears in 6 seasons.
Although, Dende appears in one extra season than Kami, but Kami has been guardian a whole lot longer than Dende, like a few hundred years.

Goku's fight with Tambourine was fast and brutal and the fight with King Piccolo with Goku was interesting.
Master Roshi did a good job of standing up to King Piccolo's attacks and at least he tried to trap Piccolo into the rice cooker using the Evil Containment Wave.
When King Piccolo makes his wish to the eternal dragon I didn't expect for him to kill the eternal dragon. I didn't think killing the dragon was possible and I thought Shenron was capable of defending himself.
When Tien tells Chiaotzu to stop King Piccolo from making his wish, I don't know if I would have done what Chiaotzu did especially when King Piccolo kills Chiaotzu with an energy blast.
King Piccolo storming King's Castle was a great piece of action, with Piccolo taking on tanks and soldiers.
This season also brings back characters like Suno, Eighter, Mr and Mrs Brief, Korin, Bora and Upa and Ox King and Chi Chi from the previous seasons of Dragonball. This also introduces the character of King Furry who later appears in the Cell Games saga in DBZ.

The fight between Tien and Piccolo's new offspring Drum was great but Drum didn't last long compare to Tambourine who lasted 7 episodes whereas Drum and Cymbal only lasted 2 episodes each. Piano also makes a last appearance in the episode `Goku Strikes Back' where Piccolo is thrown by Goku and lands on top of Piano, crushing him.
Disc 5 is the only DVD to contain 2 episodes. They should have had Disc 4 containing 6 episodes and have the last 3 episodes on Disc 5.
Goku's fight with King Piccolo was probably the best in Dragonball and now we will see how King Piccolo's son will carry on his father's legacy.

This season is the reason why the first four seasons of Dragonball have bits and pieces of other sagas on one season and then continue it on the next season. I'm sure the people working on the Dragonball project would have considered to put 2 sagas together on the first 4 seasons but Season 4 would have had the `Tien Shinhan saga' and `King Piccolo saga but it would have had 39 episodes which can't fit on 5 discs, only 35 can.

Watching this saga/season just proves how much content was left out in the movie
`Dragonball: Evolution'.",1279324800,,5264,4.510482180293501
4092190,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"Here comes King Piccolo!!!! The forth season of Dragonball, when Goku and Friends face a new threat, King Piccolo. Highly recommended.",1273363200,,134,5.428571428571429
4092191,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"Another great box set from a series long overdue for such treatment. With the rest of the twenty second tournament and the entire King Piccolo Saga on hand, Dragon Ball really catches it's stride with this season.

First of all the semifinals of the tournament are fantastic. In the fight between Tien and Roshi we finally get to see the ancient master of martial arts cut lose and fight seriously, and the impact he has on Tien's resolve adds an uncommon level of depth for this series. Tien's path towards redemption is probably the best of all the villains turned heroes in the Dragon Ball mythos. In the second semifinal battle we get a terrific fight between Krillin and Goku. While the two students of Roshi fought not long after they first met, it wasn't an impressive battle. It was a dust cloud fight, like something literally torn from loony toons. This time they have a great battle with each testing their mettle against the other. Krillin really manages to impress as he uses his newly learned Kamehameha not as a direct attack against Goku but as a distraction, and it works quite well. Unfortunately for poor Krillin, Goku has work out the weakness in his tail and now has no weak points. Eventually, Goku defeats his best friend and moves on to the finals.

The final match between Tien and Goku is actually a mixed lot. While there are some really terrific exchanges, there are also some awkward moments and some rather gimmicky moves. Tien's vollyball fist would be among them. Chiaotzu intervenes in the match by using his power to paralyze Goku under orders from Master Shen. While this seems like a really cheap trick, it actually serves as an important plot device. When Tien learns of his Master's deception, he gives up his quest to kill Goku and avenge Tao. Tien makes that fateful decision and becomes a hero, and the Krane Hermit goes on a one-way flight via Kamehameha, thanks to Master Roshi. The conclusion of the battle still kind of baffles me, as I'm not really sure how hitting a car results in Goku hitting the ground first and losing, but ah well. Tien gets a very well deserved honor as World Champion.

But there's no rest for Goku and his friends. Right after the tournament, Krillin is murdered by an unimaginably powerful monster. When Goku chases the villainous Tambourine down, he gets pounded almost as easily. Master Roshi then tells the history behind this new threat known as the Demon King Piccolo. While Tambourine is out assassinating martial artists, Goku meets a new ally in Yajerobi. Though the two of them don't meet under the best of terms and even have a pretty good little tussle, Yajerobi soon finds himself assaulted by a monster known as Cymbal. The creature is another child of King Piccolo sent to retrieve Dragon Balls like the one Yajerobi has. However the mountain man easily defeats the monster and eats him for dinner. Tambourine is sent to discover the fate of his brother only to also be killed by Goku. Finally King Piccolo shows up himself and has a rather impressive and dominating fight against Goku. The villain wins cleanly and retrieves the Dragon Ball.

Meanwhile Master Roshi, Tien, and Chiaotzu have collected the other Dragon Balls, and are forced to a confrontation with King Piccolo. Roshi sprays Tien with a sleep gas so he can't interfere, but the young fighter remains conscious to witness the events that take place. Roshi tries to seal King Piccolo using the same Evil Containment Wave that his own master used to seal the devil up in the first place. However the master fails, and passes away as an after effect of using the wave. With all seven Dragon Balls on hand, Piccolo gets ready to make his wish. Tien sends a telepathic message to Chiaotzu and tells him to interject his own wish to the dragon to make Piccolo disappear, but the Demon King kills the small fighter before he succeeds. Finally King Piccolo gets his wish to have his youth restored, and his first act is to kill the eternal dragon. With the dragon balls defunct and Roshi dead, King Piccolo assumes all of his enemies are destroyed and proceeds to conquer the world.

However Goku recovers from his battle with Piccolo and with the aid of Master Korin seeks out the Ultra Devine Water. Alongside a reluctant Yajerobi, Goku recovers the sacred liquid and drinks from it, unveiling his dormant powers. Stronger then ever, Goku returns to face King Piccolo, but only after Tien arrives to challenge the evil tyrant. Tien has practiced alone and managed to perfect the Evil Containment Wave. He plans to sacrifice himself to once again seal up King Piccolo, but is held at bay by Piccolo's newest child, Drum. Drum proves more then a match for Tien, but Goku takes the monster out with a single hit. The proceeding battle between Piccolo and Goku would define all the battles to follow.

After a terrific fight, Piccolo gains the upper hand by threatening a defenseless Tien. After disabling both of Goku's legs and one of his arms, Piccolo thinks the battle is his. However with a clear shot at his enemy, Goku uses his one hand remaining to create a powerful Kamehameha that propels him toward Piccolo. In a dramatic climax, Goku plows right through the torso of King Piccolo, and inflicts a mortal wound. However, with his dying breath, King Piccolo produced a final egg. From this egg Piccolo would be reincarnated, and begin life anew. But that's a story for another day.

Piccolo is one of my favorite villains in the entire series. He's the only one to succeed in conquering the world and kills just about everybody who stands in his way. The final confrontation he has with Goku is classic, and really sets the bar for the battles to come. This is the series at it's best, and even Dragon Ball Z would be hard pressed to top it.",1272931200,,5793,4.6902654867256635

My one issue with these Dragon Ball releases is that they're all five discs, and there's absolutely no reason for that. No kidding, the fifth disc has only TWO episodes on it. JUST TWO.  You really couldn't re-arrange it into a four disc set?

Also I really don't care for these fold out packages in the super fat boxes.",1524787200,,446,4.481481481481482

8391693,5,B0038Q9Q6W,"The King Piccolo Saga is the best one in the entire series. The fights are great, the story's engaging, and there is a lot of death. It's hard to describe any of the story without giving away the numerous surprises this season. This the beginning of the transition from a goofy adventure story to the drama more akin to DBZ.

If you're a DBZ fan and are leary of the goofy nature of the original series, this would be a good starting point. All the familiar characters have been introduced, the fighting is ramped up, and the stakes seem higher. This is hands down the best saga.",1519948800,,579,4.411214953271028
