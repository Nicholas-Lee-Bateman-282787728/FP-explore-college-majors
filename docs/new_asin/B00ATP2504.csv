8557643,5,B00ATP2504,"You know all too well the movies being touted as being ""great"" that everyone has for sale, owns and seen at least once.
Every so often, you hope to find some hidden treasure or ""gem"" that some how, went under the media hype radar that studios shamelessly over-fund in convincing us the paying audience that their product is ""great.""
As is the case here, this movie is unbeknownst to most and had I not been in search of costume ideas for animals the other night, I would not of come across this true gem. In fact, while casually watching a movie, I am sewing costumes for my various animals. they will wear them in the little animal parades I run for juvenile delinquents that were emotionally, physically or sexually abusive to animals.
This was not the case here, as I put away my sewing to be fully-attentive to the movie till the very end. Sadly, I had a few puppy, turtle and hedgehog messes to clean up afterwards because I didn't let them out in time to use the potty.
I won't go into some long-winded movie review like many suppose themselves to be of interest to internet strangers while giving away the plot and ultimately, the ending.
No, that would be rude, but this much I will say, if you liked the movies ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer,""""Rango,""""Barnyard,""""Cinderella (the 1987 black one with Brandi and Whoopi,)"" and ""The King's Speech,"" than this is one movie you really need to own. Trust me, it is that good.",1362873600,2,1428,4.58203125
