1350900,5,B00004TJS8,"To balance out the previous reviewer...  Yes the story is a bit hard to comprehend at first.  This is both deliberate and necessary at first, since  we view the world pretty much thru the eyes of the protaganist Yushiro.  Unfortunately, many things are hidden from his view, thus we don't get to  know them as well.  The story does picked up near episode 4.",967334400,2,357,4.5
1350901,2,B00004TJS8,"This show made no sense to me at all. I've heard it called a cross between Gundam Wing and Evangelion...which I don't think is a good thing on any account. I guess if you like both of those shows, it's worth a shot  watching... Me, I was just too darned bored to keep with it. Brain Power'd  is much better (and I don't even LIKE that series at all!).  In the first  episode, the characters were kind of flat, but then, they didn't get to  talk much. The rest of the program was all technobabble or weird dances...  I tried watching a second episode to make sure it didn't get better, but  honestly, my eyes started to glaze over as I watched. I was THAT BORED. It  could be argued that it's all philisophical, or war technobabble that  should be enlightening, but I'm going to call the series' bluff and say  that the emperor is naked. In other words, I don't see anything there. If  there *is* something there, the writer or director or whoever certainly  hasn't dropped enough hints to keep me interested, but I honestly don't  think there's anything back there...",963360000,2,1067,4.466321243523316
1350911,4,B00004TJS8,"At times the plot can be a little hard to follow and the characters are similar to Neon G, but I found that I quite enjoyed it. The characters for the most part are likable and there is a healthy dose of intrigue.

1350912,5,B00004TJS8,"Gasaraki is one of the best animes I have ever seen.  I am kind of an amatuer anime fan, but I have seen a lot of movies and this one tops them all.  It has a deliciously complex plot and great characterization, all the while keeping you hooked with its drama and explosions.  It's one of those movies that, after watching it, you audibly say WOW!, even if you're alone and sit and stare at the credits for about fifteen minutes before snapping yourself out of the trance and rewinding the movie and watching it again.",1005004800,,518,4.375
1350913,1,B00004TJS8,"Slow, too slow. Too much of the same ole theme you'll find in most other fighting movies.
Main character is mystic preist who can summon ""demons"" from another dimension (although this hasn't been figured out yet by the knotheads in charge).
He is also a fighting mecha pilot helping prototype the mecha (in essence, this is a ""birth of robot combat"" theme). Part of demon tissue secured in some previous experiment is being used to make the robot's controls.
The writers know nothing about military nor combat, and everything goes the way the writers want. I expect to see a tank jump up on treads and tip-toe across the ground, grab it's own barrel and smash an opponent, it's that hokey. They had mechanical designers to try to make it look and sound realistic, but only kids with experience with their sister's G.I. Joe dolls (G.I. Joe, the ultimate accessory every Barbie has to have...) will be impressed.
I'm am sick of seeing someone shoot at someone else and the shots explode at their feet. No wonder these dorks spend so much time shooting and so little hitting: if you are shooting at someones toes you can only get lucky when a bullet richocheting up at their body now and then.
Flash and excitement. Not realism. Grade C cenima.
No humor. Not enough warm sexual feeling. Too moody and generally constipated. It's like a super mix of Ninja fighting machines, psycho main characters, mystery and combat, magical psionic powers, super sorcery, evil-people out to rule the world, with none of the redeeming humor and lightness and basically human emotions of other series. I can only think, ""If the main character ever get's killed, it won't be any tears from me. Hey, maybe they'll replace him with someone with a life...""
Maybe someone who isn't a teenie-bopper, single and without a girlfirend. The closest gal-pal is his sister, and - also obvious - the counter-preistess the bad guys have in control will probably turn into his lady love. One more I-was-a-lonely-teenager-looking-for-love-and-then-I-met-you plot theme.
Of course, if that's your twist, though, it'll twist you good.
I loved the previews on other movies, the title song held great promise, the animation looked great (and is fairly sharp), but I rented it rather than bought it (after being burned by the glut of fighting robot movies). I was glad I only rented. Usually I can at least rent and watch a series (like Blue Submarine, which won't tempt my pocket book until it comes out all on one CD - the price is  criminal for an otherwise excellent short series) but this one wasn't even worth the rental.
And now you know that any movie I rate ""*"" will probably be one you think is ""*****"". And vice versa. What I rate ""****"" or ""*****"" will probably not even be worth a rental to you.",1003017600,2,2767,4.752598752598753
1350914,4,B00004TJS8,"This DVD is incredible, it not only focuses upon the next generation of technology, but it also deals with traditional theatre.  I have been privledge to view several authentic ""No -Gia"" theatre presentations and I am amazed how close this DVD comes to real theatre.
  But enough of that, This title is a wonderful blend of fantasy, psychic phenomina, and super technology.  Almost like Mia the Psychic girl meets Mobile Suit.

1350915,3,B00004TJS8,"Gasaraki is nothing new in terms of anime. The animation is decent, and that is probably its strong point. The series starts off extremely slow, and I found myself falling asleep the first few episodes. Even when the story is established, it is just a combination of elements from Evangelion, Gundam Wing, and a few other anime. I would like to finish the series, but its not worth buying.",994291200,,389,4.6521739130434785
1350916,4,B00004TJS8,"Intrigued by the artwork and content, I was also inundated with confusion. It's a little hard to follow, and a little slow to begin with. The creators of Gasaraki seem to just jump right in, mid-story, and proceed without explanation. Although, I was captivated by the combination of traditional Japanese dance sequences and military efforts to invoke some sort of sentient being. Highly captivating, one that must be watched closely, Gasaraki is beautifully done. Do you like waffles?",992476800,2,485,5.230769230769231
1350917,5,B00004TJS8,"After religiously watching Neon Genesis Evangelion, and then watching this i can truly appreciate the work done on this anime.  Gasaraki takes a far more serious tone than Evangelion throughout the film, this leaves you to enjoy the film without interjection of sometimes inappropriate humor from the more annoying characters.  The voices for the characters fit like a glove and the animation of the TAs is excellent.  Tied up with a very compelling storyline so far equivalent to that of NGE makes it a must have for the more intellectual anime fans as well as all others.",992476800,,573,4.88659793814433
1350918,1,B00004TJS8,"Finally viewed the first two DVDs after seeing all the hype about it and was sorely disappointed. Overall, it feels like there is a lot behind the story and much promise in the rest of the series, but the telling of the story is very painful. Here are my problems with it:
1. Story pacing - Much, much too slow. It feels like the story tellers are stretching out the story to fill a preset number of episodes. Minor plot details are repeated multiple, multiple times. Unnecessary scenes are inserted. I mean, do you really need to see three different characters repeat three times in succession that they are being attacked by fighter jets? Some of the sequences are also rather bizarre (hello? She was right in front of you and nothing was attacking you. Why didn't you just talk to her for a minute instead of leaving and anguishing over her later?)
2. Characters - I do not like them, do not identify with them. I loved Rei from NGE, but the moodiness of the main character is something totally different. Other characters seem too hostile, etc. There are the efforts at cutesy, perky female characters, but compared to the general moodiness/seriousness of everyone else, they do not seem to fit. Ultimately, a third of the characters are just annoying while the rest fail to make any connection.
2. Animation - Beautiful art. Horrible animation. Too many scenes have nothing but a moving mouth. This may have been acceptable quality 10-20 years ago, but looks awful compared to many of the others out there today. It looks like too little effort was spent on the animation, too many shortcuts taken. Even the credits sequence suffers from this. There's a 1 second animation that is looped for like 15-20 seconds. Compared to the quality of animation that went into NGE or even Nadesico, Gasaraki looks very poor.
Overall, the first two discs were a severe disappointment after seeing all the positive reviews on this series. What may have been an excellent storyline appears to be handicapped by awful execution.",991008000,2,2016,4.7793696275071635
1350919,4,B00004TJS8,"Without a doubt the Japanese have been watching the X-Files.  This is X-Files meets Evangelion.  It is mysterious and pulse pounding.  The mechs are believable, and move realistically.
The protagonist of this story is a mysterious dancer, who is a member of a powerful japanese family.  They have somehow merged some supernatural forces for military applications, and our hero is the key to it.
Animation is excellent, and english dub is excellent.  I left the language on English because it was so good.
Like the X-Files and Evangelion, all you need is one to get you hooked.  The story and conspiracy plots will keep you coming back.
The reason this didn't get 5 stars is that I don't like the way the mechs look.  But that is just me.",988243200,,737,4.666666666666667
1350920,2,B00004TJS8,"I picked this video up under the assumption that it was something like Gundam and Evangelion. It is, and it's not particularly original. The animation is better than a lot I've seen, but that's one of the few good things I can say about it. The characters are monotonous and the story line is too confusing to get anything out of. The mecha is realistic but boring. I'm completely lost on the whole Noh thing! This video didn't offer me anything I hadn't seen anywhere else, and to top it off, it was confusing and boring, so I can't really reccomend it.",983491200,2,554,4.4411764705882355
1350921,5,B00004TJS8,"This will be perhaps talked about as the Macross series of the next decade or so. Superb animation and character designs. The story is very deep and very intelligent. The armored suits are based on real physics to bring it to a real life world that we can associate ourselves with. The mech designs are awesome. This is the first volume in the growing library of Gasaraki, so get in early and keep buying the DVDs to support this intelligent robot anime. I was surprised at how good this anime is, it really is worth your money if you liked Macross or mech war type movies, but if you just want a bunch of action sequences not tied together by a good story then this is not the series for you. This is story with elements of action, some episodes contain no mech war at all, but others might be entire episodes of war. It definitely is for mature watchers, most likely the 18+ crowd to understand the story well and not be put to sleep by the character interaction. Awesome.",982713600,9,974,4.386740331491713
1350922,4,B00004TJS8,"I first picked up a copy of Gasaraki after hearing that it was from the guys that made Mobile Suit Gundam and Patlabor so great. Gasaraki also has a shot for greatness . Due to time constraints, I put it on my shelf after only watching the first episode. Thankfully, when I had some free time, I popped it into my DVD player again and was glad I did. Near the end, I found myself wanting to go out and buy the second DVD to continue the story. Average anime fans might find Gasaraki a little bit slow at parts due to the fact that the majority of the time deals more with the characters and less with the mecha and battles. But then things start to speed up as we find out what's really going on on Belgistan...
 Unlike other mecha animes, the TAs (tactical armors)in Gasaraki do not distinctly have ""faces"", so the mecha become less characters in the anime and more functional machines. Contrary to some belief, the plot of Gasaraki seems very orignial, and takes a more realistic approach to mecha. In fact, throughout the begining, there are only 2 mechs that actually appear in the show. Just like current military research and development, the next generation TA would probably roll off the production line in at least ten years after its present predecesor. This is very much a political thriller, and under all the government involvement, two separate companies are actually fueling the war for their own purposes. The english voices are suprisingly pretty good too, and fit the characters well. While the first episode may not fully grab everyone's interest, sit this one through to the end and you'll find yourself liking it more than you thought, at least I did. While the extras just give a brief overview of Gasaraki and then basically direct you to ADV's website for more, the glossary was kinda nice just to brush up on some of the characters and their roles. A little confusing at first but then getting better, Gasaraki proves there is more to it by the end of the first DVD.",980294400,,1991,4.57703081232493
1350923,2,B00004TJS8,"I thought that this series was going to be as good as Neon Genesis, but it dosen't come close.  In Those regards it is nothing like that series at all.  There is this espionage thing going on, there is this mecha thing going on, and there is this crazy dancing stuff.  What does it have to do with each other?  They never explain it in these four episodes, and all these elements feel like seperate different anime themes just thrown into the mix.  The anime itself has some good art to it, but without the story to back it up you find yourself baffled while watching it.  At times you felt that there was a build up to some excitement, an explanation, or even something interesting, but the episode would just end at that point.  The next episode would not build on this excitement, but would just add more elements to the unexplained story.  The overall feel is that you started watching this in the middle of the series.  If you like espionage, mechas, and crazy things then this is right to your tastes.",979344000,,1007,4.429347826086956
1350924,4,B00004TJS8,"The first DVD in any series (in this case, containing 4 episodes) usually has a difficult task to carry out.  Outline the story, introduce the characters, set the tone, and provide a window into how things will look in future episodes.  That being said, you will be instantly confused at the outset of this DVD (by design) but by the end, you will know what's going on and the basic conflict of the series.
This is very much a political thriller, techno-intrigue sort of show.  The plotis...[directly from] the Gulf War (with the characters that parallel Norman Schwarzkopf and Saddam Hussein looking EXACTLY like their real world predecessors (in addition to the various news footage that echo the Gulf War situation in an exact manner.)  War plays a big part in this disc of episodes with plenty of generals and troops and politicians, which might all add up to increase the yawn-factor for some.  There are many characters involved, much back-room dealing and ample storyline advancement.  But if you were looking...for any bloody action scenes, there are none of those....  This is all very dry stuff, almost like reading a book.
And that's a big part of my misgivings about this: I don't know how many people want the equivalent of a Robert Ludlum or Tom Clancy book in their anime.  Makes for some, frankly, very boring tracts of exposition.  I yawned several times.  I can't really draw any parallels to other anime because this one is very much rooted in reality, and reality-based situations.  It does have mecha, and the requisite mysteries yet to be solved (some of which do appear to point to some non-reality based solutions.)
I just don't know if your average anime fan would be willing to sit through all the techno-speak and convoluted political storylines to get to the ""good parts.""  Make no mistake, the story is told very well, reveals little by little the details of what's going on, and does make sense.  The animation is adequate, music is sparse and almost absent, the dubbing is superb, though the DVD extras consist of little besides referring you to the Gasaraki website for more in-depth stuff.
I don't know.  After seeing the first DVD, I would like to see the rest, but I'm in no great hurry.  I guess Gasaraki didn't hold my interest well enough to make me a huge fan.",978912000,9,2299,4.741206030150754
1350925,5,B00004TJS8,"This series is wonder for those who love mild action, great animation, and a well though out plot. There are many more things that make it a nice series, but there is one bad thing about it, for some people, the plot is a little confusing at times. So if you buy this wonder series, make sure you aren't interrupted because otherwise, you'll get a little lost for some time, unless you're like me and always rewind if someone says something while you're watching it.
This is a highly recommended series if you are just getting started or even if you have been watching anime since you were born.",978393600,2,595,4.467889908256881
1350926,2,B00004TJS8,"Let me start off by saying, I thought the Patlabor films were brilliant and Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the all time best series. However, Gasaraki doesn't come close to either. The animation is nice and the mecha designs are neat but to put Gasaraki in the same league as a NGE boggles the mind. Gasaraki's story is far too sloppy and conveluded to keep me interested at all. Furthermore the characters are hardly likable including Mr. dancing kabuki man. Two words sum up Gasaraki, pretentious and boring.",977875200,7,513,4.775280898876405
1350927,5,B00004TJS8,"If you thought Spriggan was gonna be the only anime that appeals to Americans, you might be wrong. Ever liked Gundam Wing, but hated the animation? Ever liked Robotech, but had too big of a love story to feed you? The solution to all these problems is Gasaraki. The first episode starts off with Gowa and 3 other people in TAs (Tactical Armor). Gowa's heart rate gets too fast and the training mission stops. Then Gowa has to perform a summoning of.....I think it was Gasarki (maybe). Anyway, Gowa performs the dance to make it come and is almost stopped by the girl with green hair. Gowa listens to her and stops it. The second episode features a little test of just how cool the TAs can be. And some political inteligents get thrown in. The third episode was the coolest! The Multi National forces plans to attack a town with a fleet of tanks. But whats this? TAs? About 3 TAs come in and a cool battle ensues. The fourth episode has Gowa going out for duty at sea. Suddenly, Gowa has this sudden urge to summon again, gets out of his TA and starts the dance again, but before he can even get far, he gets assasiated. He wasn't hurt cause the helmet blocked the bullet, but he was in shock. The episode ends with three enemy TAs coming to fight and one of them is piloted by that green haired girl. This tape was hard top follow, but it was worth watching. The battles are extremely cool. The opening reminds me of Robotech and the ending sequence tells me that the green haired girl and Gowa will soon be in love. Summoning aside, this is the most coolest political war anime I've seen since Gundam Wing.",972691200,2,1607,4.377926421404682
1350928,5,B00004TJS8,"This has to be the most interesting and captivating series that I have seen in a while. As the other reviews mentioned there is a resemblance to N.G. Evangelion, but I would argue that it is only superficial. The flavor of this story is completely different. The brilliantly complex plot is set in a geo-political conflict reminiscent of Desert Storm. The creators strived for realism and succeed in intellectually engaging the audience. The mixture and contrast of modern politics, near future technology and traditional Japanese culture and mysticism are spellbinding. The story involves ever increasing layers of secrets and mysteries. These are revealed to us slowly and meticulously. The more details we learn the more we realize how little we know. What I find fascinating is that all the action is played out by secondary characters while the two protagonists are the greatest mystery. The character development is very strong, even though in the case of the two main characters it is very slow. I believe that this adds to the quality of the series. The DVD menus and extras are quite good, but the in-menu navigation is a bit quirky once in a while. I only wish that the entire interview with Ryosuke Takahashi was included. For the rest of the interview we have to go to the ADV website - sneaky way to get those web hits. Gasaraki is a must see. Intelligent, complex and engaging - I'd put it on the top of your anime wish list. My only regret is that I have to wait over a month for the next DVD installment.",972691200,28,1520,4.696629213483146
1350929,5,B00004TJS8,"I cannot tell you how great this new ADV title is.  I was fortunate enough  to get an advance copy of Gasaraki (thank you very much VH) and I was  thoroughly blown away with the animation and the premise behind this title.  The story is soooo great and it unravels as you watch this amazing  animation.  I stress buying this title will change your life.  The first  three episodes on tape 1 are somewhat slow, but remember this is a long  story arc that takes some time to set up.  BELIEVE ME, ITS WORTH IT!  If  you're trying to decide what new anime you need, make it GASARAKI.  You  will not be disappointed.  An' I'm out.",968630400,,625,4.267241379310345
1350930,5,B00004TJS8,"Breathtaking.  It's about time that somebody one-upped Evangelion and created a truly epic ""giant robot"" series with both a thoughtful,  intelligent premise as well as spectacular animation.  Like Eva, Gasaraki  takes a few episodes to get up to speed (the third and fourth episodes on  this tape are where the action really kicks in) and the audience, like the  series central character Yushiro, is initially forced to figure out what's  going on at the same speed that the hero is.  This may bother those with  short attention spans, but be advised that this series is well worth the  time put into viewing it.  Thus far I've seen the first twenty episodes in  the original Japanese and the first four episodes in ADV's excellent dub,  and believe me, every time you think you've got the next plot development  figured out, the writers come up with a new way to knock your socks off.  Add in the best animated mecha battles in any anime tv series and you've  got one of the best giant robot show ever.",967507200,4,1003,4.645714285714286

7922830,4,B00004TJS8,"The Gowa clan is attempting to contact a being known as Gasaraki. At this point we don't know what it is, but we do get the impression that it has enormous power. This is set against the backdrop of a world where a humanoid weapons platform is a new technology. A war in a middle eastern country has begun, and this new mecha has been implemented for the first time. The combination of modern warfare and traditional Japanese values seem to be taking this mecha anime series in a different direction.

This series has a slow and confusing 1st 2 episodes. The main character hardly speaks at all in the 1st 40 minutes of the show. The last 2 episode on this disc heat up a bit. The war has started, and our main character is sent off to the front lines. The animation is pretty decent for an older series. There are also some very familiar voices like Chris Patton, Monica Rial, and Hilary Haag. So far, I can see that a lot of thought has been put into this series and the plot seems to be pretty deep as far as I can tell by the 1st 4 episodes. This is probably a psychologically intense anime as well. I'm looking forward to seeing more of this anime. I can't recommend it quite yet, but I'm about to watch the rest of it and I'll let know know more as I watch the other DVDs.",1355356800,,1278,4.195121951219512

I've really enjoyed this first disc.

It has interested me in its mysteries, I like the animation (I prefer older animation to the look of the new stuff) and the mecha designs are pretty cool.

The Gowa family runs the Gowa corporation, a global conglomerate. They have built an experimental Tactical Armor suit (a robot, but these ones are closer in spirit to the powered armor of Heinlein's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starship-Troopers/dp/0441783589/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starship Troopers</a>). They are trying to sell some to the Japanese Self Defense Forces when a war breaks out in the fictional Middle Eastern country of Belgistan.

U.N. forces are sent in to Belgistan only to discover that the Belgistanis have their own Tactical Armor!

The Gowas are also trying to conduct a ritual, though what their goals are with that are so far shrouded in mystery.

I was surprised at the supernatural aspect. I thought the series was based around a war in the Middle East. Well, it is based around that war, but there is a lot more going on behind the scenes. I'm really curious about the Gowa family and their corporation. Overall I don't think they are the good guys. I have a feeling there's something going on with them and Belgistan.

The main character is Yushiro Gowa, the youngest brother of the Gowa family. He seems to be a tool for the rest of the family and so far appears to be shut out of their machinations. He sometimes comes off as the stereotypical world weary hero that is so popular in anime. Except for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shin-Kazama/dp/B000FII248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shin Kazama</a>, those types of heroes are annoying. Snap out of it! The rest of the characters are so far more interesting than he is.

I will say that the series is slow moving and dense compared to most robot shows. There are a lot of characters to follow. This was a good thing for me as I watched all four episodes back to back, but I could see if I was watching a single episode at a time it would probably be hard to get into.

That shouldn't put you off of buying the DVD. Watch the entire thing through and see if you are interested in continuing. For me, I'm hooked.",1250726400,,3117,6.149425287356322

 I'm a fan of big robots and military stories, so if you're into this type of anime go ahead and get it. The main character is misterious and instantly drags you into the plot, and without you thinking about it you'll want to know what the purpose of the TA system really is. I give it four stars since the anime is a little too old for me.

 Over all Gasaraki is one of the best looking anime of recent years and any fan of big robots and well chorographed action secuences will more than enjoy this series.",1109030400,2,702,4.177777777777778

7922834,1,B00004TJS8,"I'm not one to write off a confusing Anime.  I still don't fully understand Lain or Boogiepop Phantom.  But at least with these animes I understood the basic idea of the story and by the end I had resolution.  Gasaraki just left me dazed and confused.  Don't waste your time with this.  There are tons of anime out there and most of them are way more worth spending time on then this one.  Honestly I wouldn't even give it one star.  Please, please, please go check out something else like Lain, Boogiepop Phantom, Trigun, GTO, Bubblegum Crisis 2040, Cowboy Bepop, Ranma 1/2, Tenchi, Samurai X.  Need anymore suggestions?",1030752000,4,621,4.685185185185185
7922835,1,B00004TJS8,"I've seen and have many Japanese animation titles and believe me, don't waste your time with this one.  I don't know where these other people reviewing this are coming from, but this was so boring that I could hardly stay awake.  The plot, characters and animation is very bad...whoever said the animation is great in this is full of it!  You want to see good animation?  Watch ""Ghost in the Shell"" or ""Blue Submarine #6"" and both of those have GREAT stories to boot.  Other good ones are ""Trigun"", ""Akira"", ""Outlaw Star"", ""Cowboy Beebop"", and ""Escaflowne: The Movie"" just to name a few.  Save your money and time and STAY away from this one.",1028937600,3,642,4.587719298245614
7922836,5,B00004TJS8,"Don't just SEE it.  Any serious anime fan should have this series.  I've seen up to disk 5, and it is one of my favorite animes (and I have a huge collection on DVD).  I highly recommend it for older viewers, but make sure you have toys for the young 'uns, because they will get bored pretty quickly.  It takes the level of appreciation that you only get from maturity to enjoy anime like this.  The action is amazing, but there is a lot of politics, and quite a lot of old Japanese tradition in it as well.  It's very rewarding anime for intellectual crowds in the college-and-up age levels.  Think almost of the Rurouni Kenshin OVA's (but with big friggin machines and lots of tanks).",1020038400,3,686,4.396825396825397
7922837,1,B00004TJS8,"I can pretty much sum up this anime in one word...cliche. First you have the [bad] corporation vying for world domination. You have the cheesy mechs straight out of the 80's, and the main character fits the category of cleche like a glove. I'm pretty confident that this movie was scripted by 10-year olds who take themselves too seriously. I'm kicking myself for wasting the 20 or so dollars I spent on this worthless piece of ""anime"" I wouldn't waste my money on buying or even renting this.",1017878400,,493,4.613636363636363
7922838,4,B00004TJS8,"This is a great series however the first several episodes can be very slow at developing the characters and plot.  After the first volume, things start to make more sense.  This series is very complex and can be confusing at times but if government cover-ups, top-secret missions and robot battles are your kind of thing, you'll probably enjoy this.  I recommend this series however before you buy it, I think you should rent the first couple volumes to make sure you like it.  People will either love this series or hate it",1013040000,,524,4.663043478260869
