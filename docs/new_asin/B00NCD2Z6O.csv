8677397,5,B00NCD2Z6O,"this disc has some great punching combinations. it's not meant to be self defense but conditioning, and there's not much that will beat it for that purpose. if you want this for techniques it can be done. pick specific techniques and train for strength and keep your elbows up at all times. on the dvd the guy drops his guard. take what this teaches you and add good defense principles and you're set.",1461369600,2,401,4.506849315068493
