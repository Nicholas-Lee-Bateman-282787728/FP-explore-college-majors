318523,5,6301221923,"I have enjoyed watching this movie everytime I see it.  For the past couple years I haven't been able to find it by renting it, but I've finally ordered it online.  This is such a great movie because it is about being the only two females in their training group and succeeding beyond anyones amazement.  I too am going to college for my BA in Law Enforcement and wish to become an FBI agent and this is such a great movie because it gives me a silly sense of what to expect or not to expect.  I know this was done in 1988 but still, its a weird way of being goofy with FBI agents.",1075161600,2,581,4.026086956521739
318524,5,6301221923,"Rebecca DeMornay and Mary Gross make a wonderful team in this hilarious movie.  I saw it for the first time when I was stressed out from collge studies and working almost full time.
It's about two young women who want to be FBI agents and are struggling with all the demands.  Mary Gross' character (Janet Zuckerman) is a ""brainy"" gal who is long on study skills and short on athletic know-how.  Rebecca DeMornay's character (Ellie DeWitt) is just the opposite--long on athletic abilities, but inexperienced in the academic department.  The teaming up of these two like-minded but opposite people is, in my opinion, ""buddy action"" at its best.
I still pull this movie out and watch it.  I'm always impressed with Ms. DeMornay's awesome acting ability and Ms. Gross' comedy skills.  It's a great ""escape"" when I feel stressed out.",1050710400,6,829,4.885714285714286
318525,4,6301221923,I simply loved this movie. It's funny and makes you cheer on the underdog.  It was great that females were the top dog in this movie. I can't wait till it's on DVD.,1031443200,10,164,3.9696969696969697

318626,4,6301221923,"Another HBO experience of a film I saw in the afternoon during the summer.  It's a light hearted look at two females trying to go through the rigors of FBI training, and, as with a lot of Hollywood offerings, liberties are taken.  It's not a big gut busting laugh out loud kind of comedy, but it has a certain charm to it.  Think of Police Academy without the raunch or blue humor, and a slightly more serious (though still light hearted) look at law enforcement training.

It's a decent film that perhaps could have used a laugh or two more in the gag department, but is otherwise okay.  I'm just sorry they don't make films like this anymore.

Give it a shot and see what you think.",1492646400,,684,4.346456692913386

Except for the idea that women might not be good enough to be in law enforcement, this is not a message movie, thriller, shocker or zombie movie.

319056,5,6301221923,"I loved this movie as a kid. I loved it because here were two women who, instead of being at each other's throat in a competitive manner, decided to join forces and beat the system that frankly didn't want them. It wasn't that one of them was just smart, and the other one was just bodily strength, but that they combined their efforts and brought each other up to near equal levels of achievement. Frankly, this movie was one of those that encouraged me when I was young to just do what I wanted to career-wise. It was nice to see women in a movie, kicking ass without having to ""hate men"" or use sex to get where they wanted to be. It's a little seen gem.",1437696000,,657,4.181102362204724

319132,4,6301221923,"I found this movie randomly while looking for comedies to watch and to be honest, I try to avoid '80s movies. Carey Grant is my favorite actor so it's not as if I do not like older films it's just something about '80s cinema that doesn't appeal to me. Anyway, I gave ""Feds"" a chance because of the reviews and the fact that it stars Mary Gross who plays the role of Janis, I remember her fondly from my childhood favorite ""Troop Beverly Hills"". I'm glad I didn't skip this one over! Even though this came out in 1988, it doesn't feel dated at all, though I did find it interesting how Fred Thompson (""Mr. Bilecki"") still manages to look like he does now, old! :-)

I'm no prude and have nothing against crude or obscene humor, however, ""Feds"" was refreshing in the sense that it's a ""female buddy"" cop movie that didn't have to depend on vulgarity or sexuality to be entertaining unlike its modern counterpart ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Heat/dp/B00F4YKCFA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Heat</a>"". Yes, both women have a crush on their respective male equivalents, but the movie didn't dwell on it so it didn't resort to being a romcom either, which typically happens these days. Overall they just help each other become more competitive against their fellow classmates, there's no trickery involved, no toilet humor, no crudeness, and really no male-bashing either - the brainy Janis helps Marine Ellie become a better test taker and Ellie gives tips to Janis on how to pass the physical requirements. Good clean fun. I would've been satisfied if the jerks failed but oh well, good ending nonetheless.

Not necessarily laugh out loud funny for me but I'm difficult to please in that regard, I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good comedy and/or likes ""female buddy"" films, this would be safe for children also.

SPOILER COMMENT: I don't know about anyone else but every time I see a car chase in a film, I wonder, why do they always shoot out the windows or aim at the people in the vehicle instead of aiming for the tires?  Wouldn't that make more sense?! Well ""Feds"", this little 80s flick, is the first movie I've seen that did just that! And of course the result was what I expected would happen in such a scenario but that is not prudent for this review/tidbit.....just something I enjoyed to finally see happen in a movie.",1435449600,2,2389,4.833740831295843

True it's a very dated movie in the chauvinistic attitudes of the male cast members and has an obvious male bashing overtone, that you have to take in context with the beginnings of the women's lib era that this film was made during. But the two stars Rebecca De Mornay and  Mary Gross are great in their portrayals.

Here is yet another outdated Warner Bros. movie where it's apparently hilarious to think of women in a field previously predominately occupied by men.. HIL-ARIOUS.. Like Wildcats (from '86), FEDS relies on now forgotten stereotypes and predictable plot points to move the mundane film along, with an outcome that's as easy to see as De Mornay's blonde hair... Women want to bed a fed .. women gets laughed at by men.. women study really hard to be a feds.. practices training.. men not laugh anymore.. The End..

I saw this again for the first time in over 20 years.. and I have to say, it's another 80's film to demonstrate why 80's isn't so classic after all, and just like the bad clothes and the ratted hair..and sometimes the music, it should be left right where it was... Both films are from Warner Bros..and it's hard to believe with all the worthless junk they churned out in the 80's and 90's, how they haven't gone totally broke.. Oh wait, they did at one point..

Rebecca and Mary Gross have excellent comedic timing, especially Gross. She says some of the most random things that are way out in left field and it does nothing but evoke laughter.

Rebecca & Mary are 2 field trainees attending school to become FBI agents. Rebecca is street smart and physically trained while Mary is a bookworm, but doesn't have the EDGE she needs to make it all the way. These two women are two halves that complete one another and form a bond as roommates. This movie is complete laughter from start to finish and goes at a great pace.

It purports to be a comedy but there aren't many laughs to be found here.  Allegedly the makers had the full cooperation of the FBI and therein lies the double-edged sword.  The depiction of the Bureau's training program feels authentic and informative, however, the film isn't very forthcoming about the warts in the agency.  The film's saving grace is the terrific rapport between Rebecca DeMornay and Mary Gross whose efforts keep the enterprise afloat.  A good performance is also offered here by Fred Thompson as the supervisor of the training program whom I would have voted for President if he had the stomach for it.  This is an OK flick but it's certainly not worth it's prohibitive list price.",1279929600,,854,4.971830985915493

It amazes me that this is not yet on DVD. I would not only buy it in an instant, I would buy one for all of my gal pals as gifts. These ladies are portrayed as strong, capable women with a sense of humor and responsibility. Add Fred Thompson's dry wit to the mix and the result strikes the perfect balance.",1238889600,,482,4.03125

319808,4,6301221923,"There just aren't enough female ""buddy"" movies. This is one that deserves to be available on DVD. With current female role models like Girls Gone Wild, Pussycat Dolls and their ilk, it's a real pleasure to watch character actresses with class. Speaking of which, isn't it great to see Mary Gross on Boston Legal?

Another reviewer (typical male action fan) said the movie ""picks up"" when it goes into action mode in the second half. While it's fun to watch Mary Gross and Rebecca De Mornay as their FBI-trainee characters take on their peers in training exercises, it wouldn't have been of interest if not for earlier character development. The odd couple of De Mornay's ex-Marine and Gross' intellectual have to adjust to the FBI training environment, their dismissive male classmates, and to each other as roomates. Of course they find that they each need each other's skills to succeed. They also learn that their cooperation gives them an edge over their peers, who are too competitive to help each other. There are touches of drama along with the humor, and I'd put this alongside Private Benjamin in any good chick flick collection.",1214697600,2,1138,4.896373056994818

319811,4,6301221923,"This movie is a favorite of mine, I lost the only copy I had of this movie to my ex-wife when I moved out so I had to order a brand new one from Amazon, it did not disappoint, Rebecca DeMornay delivers a terrific role as a marine turned wanna-be FBI agent.  Mary Gross as her bumbling partner and now presidential candidate Fred Thompson as their chief instructor.  The laughs come, however, not at a brisk pace but this is definitely one of those movies you can watch more than once just for the entertainment value. I whole-heartedly reccomend this movie.  The only reason it didn't get a 5th star was because it was NOT on DVD, which is a shame it hasn't been released that way as yet, perhaps someday.",1198368000,,705,4.366412213740458
319812,2,6301221923,"Feds was a bit of a disappointment considering the presence of one of the most attractive women of all time (no exaggeration here!!!).
A young female US Marine decides to try her luck with the FBI so she applies and gets accepted to the FBI Academy.  In a very predictable manner reminiscent of Police Academy, but without the humor or the sex, she struggles to get past the hurdles laid before her.
In short, the acting is pretty bad, the setting is not noteworthy, the humor is just not there (at all), the music is poor at best, while the plot and the dialogues are average and way ""below average"" respectively.
It seems as though the actors/writers/directors/producers met up with each other at a hotel lounge over drinks, and then decided, on the spot, to make a quick and easy film to keep themselves busy while waiting for a good break.
In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it; no masterpiece here...  1.5 Stars
If it's a Rebecca DeMornay movie that you're looking for, try the AMAZING 1992 thriller The Hand that Rocks the Cradle.  You won't be disappointed!",1187481600,2,1083,4.630208333333333
319813,5,6301221923,"Ivan Reitman has directed both Ghostbuster movies but decides to try something different.  And I say this one is a good one!  Rebecca DeMornay (Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Risky Business), Mary Gross (Hot To Trot) star in this bumbling comedy about two women who beat the system and decide to become FBI agents amongst men.  DeWitt (DeMornay) who just got out of the Army, goes to D.C. to become an FBI agent, and when she gets there, she meets Janet Zuckermann (Gross) they start off stale but as they advance, they become the best of friends.  Zuckermann gets stepped on from time to time cause they feel she can't cut it, until she finally takes up for herself.  Sen. Fred Dalton Thompson of Tennessee stars in this he had also been in another movie DIE HARD 2 with Bruce Willis, in this he plays Bulleki the headmaster of the FBI School.  Things get more exciting when they do the field exam where Bulleki plays a terrorist and kidnaps the professor and the students have to rescue them in order to get their badges and certificates to pass.  DeWitt and Zuckermann pass and get L.A.  I think this movie is kinda weird at first but, it has some funny parts halfway.  I hope that Warner Home Video puts it out on DVD cause I would definitely buy this one too!",1170028800,8,1261,4.447826086956522

7810166,5,6301221923,"I saw this movie in the theatre when I was in middle school and loved it. Most of the negative reviews it seemed were by men and those who are film snobs. Im a film snob as well but there was something about this story that I loved. This was a female buddy film which was rare in the 1980s (Outrageous Fortune and 9 to 5 are the only others that come to mind right now). The plot is light, and the characters are not fully developed but comedies back in the 80s were not as long as they are today (like Judd Apatow films). This really was a female empowerment film especially for young girls of my generation. We get to see how women were truly looked at in the FBI and other major, prestigious positions. And we also get to see how when females work together, they can accomplish anything. I cant wait until my daughter is old enough to see this movie with me. But we do live in a different time. Its a great film to pick up and the price is right.",1523145600,,949,4.080213903743315
