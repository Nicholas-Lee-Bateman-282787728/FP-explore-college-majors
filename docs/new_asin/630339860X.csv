643068,5,630339860X,"I remember when this premiered on TV and how much I adored it. I first grew up with the Shirley Temple version and I ""thought"" nothing could compare to that. I was wrong. After I saw this, it left Shirley Temple in the dust. Although I still think her version is great, this one made the whole 'story' seem real and very beautiful. The young girl who played heidi is cute as a button and the late Jason Robards 'made' the part as the Grandfather. It's a perfect classic family movie that your kids will more than enjoy.",1125187200,2,519,4.3061224489795915
643069,5,630339860X,"If you stacked all the DVD copies of all the box office versions of Heidi (including the late 60s version whose rep got tarnished by NBC and a football game which by the way I have bought since this review was originally writtem), and then play this, virtually everyone in my generation would start giving the other discs away as Christmas Stocking Stuffers.  Despite being a made for tv (the OLD Disney Channel before they went commercial) film, it surpasses all the classics.  Noley Thornton's performance is of equal caliber to Megan Follows in the Anne of Green Gables Trilogy.  And what a supporting cast she has with her, Jason Robards as her Grandfather, Patricia Neal as Peter's Grandmother, Sian Phillips (yup Livia from I, Claudius herself) as Clara's Grandmother, and Jane Seymour as Fraulein Rottenmeir, Clara's governess (her first bad girl role I can think of since East of Eden 81).  I was extremely grateful to see this on DVD last month, not only because it tells more of the story then any other film, but as a fellow reviewer below herself stated, the dvd copy is complete.  The VHS tape had been released at 165 minutes (that's 2 hours and 45 minutes for those who can't convert fast).  This disc is the full 191 minutes (3 hours and 11 minutes) as Disney made it in 93 all on 1 single sided disc.  Get yourself a copy, you'll be glad you did.",1119571200,62,1363,4.584362139917696
643070,4,630339860X,"Possibly one of the greatest books of all time-- this is also one of the last good made for T.V. movies disney did. As a huge Shirley Temple fan I will always love Shirley's version but, my opinon this is the best version of Heidi to own and the version I watch most often on family movie night.

The acting is brillantly done by newcomer Noley(""Fine Things"")and it has the best grandfather Jason Robarbs who delievers the performance of his career. You really catch their love and connection on screen and you see how far he will go for the little girl he loves. Really Heidi is all about faith and love renewalle and in this version you can really see that. This story also sticks more to the orginally book unlike some of the remakes which is nice since the story is perfect the way it is...

My little cousins love this movie and we all want to adopt Jason Robbarbs as our grandfather now! Some of my cousins liked the movie so much they are now reading the book for fun! I'm personally glad I bought this movie to watch with my cousins on family movie night for it's a movie all about family and connecting with the ones you love. Buy ""Heidi"" and enjoy watching it with your kids over and over again.",1108684800,10,1205,4.327433628318584
643071,5,630339860X,My name is Heidi and I have grown up getting Heidi either as a book or a movie for birthday and Christmas presents. (I do own the german version) This is by far my favorite version of Heidi. I grew up with Hayley Mills and The Wonderful World of Disney. Noley Thornton does a wonderful job of depicting Heidi. I wish it would come out on DVD!! You won't be sorry for getting this.,1105401600,5,380,4.148648648648648
643072,4,630339860X,"On commercial free television, this movie runs in two parts with a total runtime of over 3 hours. The video version of the movie has about 20 minutes cut out of the original presentation. Some really sweet nuances have been removed.

This is an enjoyable movie in either case, or course, but let's hope that Disney releases an unedited version to DVD soon! I would love to add it to my collection.",1100736000,5,397,4.513888888888889
643073,5,630339860X,"I viewed this film and realized how ugly I am compared to such a beautiful person as Heidi. She was so patient, caring, loving and wise. Please if you ever want to see a good film and you want to waste almost 3 hours of your life on films SEE THIS FILM!
The outside beauty makes you feel so ugly within... I am not kidding. It's that beautiful!",985046400,3,344,4.073529411764706
643074,5,630339860X,"Heidi has a refreshing perspective on life.  She chooses love, love for a crochety old man.  In her eyes he becomes lovable to the viewer as well.  The scenes of nature are stunning and the tender exchanges in human relationships are deeply moving. Heidi is not just a great ""G"" movie for children, it's a great movie for adults who need another glimpse, another reminder, of the beauty in our surroundings... both in people and in nature.",947894400,5,439,4.675324675324675
643075,5,630339860X,"that becomes a treasured family favorite. For our family, this is one of those films. This version of Heidi can still bring tears to our eyes after a half dozen viewings. Even my little four year old daughter, who didn't  understand why, could hardly keep from tearing up as she watched the  excellent rendition of this classic.
Originally over 3 hours long it has  been edited to a little less than 3 hours for video without significantly  affecting the story. I prefer the original uncut version, however. All the  casting and acting is superb, especially Jason Robards and Noley Thornton  as the grandfather and Heidi. Lexi Randall, Jane Seymour, Patricia Neal and  other characters were excellent also.
Jason Robards believably captured  the complex emotions of the grandfather torn between his personal guilt and  torment related to the death of his son and the attempts of Heidi to get  him to open his heart and life to her. Dete, the greedy and selfish distant  cousin, at first casts off Heidi on the grandfather to get rid of her.  Later, when she sees a way to make some money off Heidi, Dete shames the  grandfather into letting Heidi go by playing up the grandfathers own fears  that he will eventually turn against Heidi like he did his own son. Robards  was so good expressing the anger and fear that the grandfather feels before  finally realizing how much he loves and needs Heidi with him. Heidi is  capably portrayed by Noley Thornton who easily captures Heidi's exuberance  for life and her love for her grandfather and the mountains and her ability  to change the lives of all those around her.
""Heidi"" is an  emotional roller coaster ride and provides ample opportunity for tears of  sadness and joy. Punctuating the splendid scenery shot on location in  Austria is the majestic musical score by Lee Holdridge which is worth the  price of admission itself. This is a movie you and your family will  treasure and watch over and over.",947808000,35,1954,4.781437125748503

If your looking for a film to watch with the whole family that has beautiful storytelling, breathtaking scenery and a message of love and family; then this is a film you must see. It's a two part movie so there will be two dvd's in the box. Also, the film colors are clear and perfect.

643250,2,630339860X,"This is way, way too long and drawn out.  More time---far more time----should have been devoted to developing life in the mountains before shoving the viewer off to the long, drawn-out experience in town.  Clara was a whiney, manipulative, selfish and over-indulged child compared to the sweet and sensitive Clara in the book.  Ten minutes and I was done with her.  And what's with the whole sleep-walking, supernatural thing??  Who's idea was that?  Never would I show my grandkids that scene and give them nightmares.  What on earth was the point?  The melodramatic cliff scene was also predictable and a complete fabrication.  Heidi's relationship with Peter was so sweet and genuine, yet the movie completely failed to develop that for the viewer.  Her close bond to the grandmother was one of the most endearing parts of the book and it barely got a whisper in the THREE very long hours of this movie.  My Fair Lady and Fiddler On The Roof are three hours long!  Did the producers really feel they had a winner here to be in the same league as those timeless films?  If there's nobody out there who can produce a movie that actually sticks to and captures the beauty, sensitivity, and warmth of the book, then just get the Shirley Temple version; at least it's entertaining.  Why does every producer feel they can ""improve"" on something classic?  I'm willing to spend three hours watching a Heidi movie if it sticks to the real story.  Is Hollywood so jaded that they can't even grasp the idea that people will actually enjoy and pay for the chance to observe sweet, kind and caring people?  They have in other films, so why does every director mishandle this story?  I just don't understand.",1463702400,4,1697,4.733788395904437

643256,1,630339860X,"I'm giving this 1 star for the beautiful scenery (what little of it there is) and for the charm of Heidi, though it's buried beneath a completely dreary and unloveable cast.  I entered into this film determined not to compare it to the book, but even in its own right it is depressing.  For the most part the people are a miserable lot of selfish, churlish personalities----all need to be socialized.  Leaving Heidi in a freezing cold barn all night?!  And what's with the whole ""ghost"" thing??  Or Heidi falling over a cliff?  Cheesy and predictable at best and utterly melodramatic.  Hollywood with their christian-phobia (unless they're beating and nailing Jesus to the cross) just couldn't make the leap and have Heidi pray to God.  Instead she talks to a star.  If we're going to massacre the Heidi story then I'll take the Shirley Temple version and walk away loving most of the characters and having some sympathy for Klara.  It would have helped to first develop the bond with the blind grandmother and Peter in the beginning.  This is 3 hours long----(and I mean l-o-n-g); surely there could have been plenty of time for us to revel in the beauty of the alps with some likable mountain people (except for the mean and cold grandfather).  But instead, we're shuffled off in no time to spend the vast majority of time  in a mansion with a bunch of sullen, dreary, melancholy and angry characters; even Klara comes across sniveling and unbelievable---even when she's trying (really hard) to be light and happy.  She's actually dull and unlikable, and concerned with her own selfish wants.  The father has issues; we'll just leave it at that.  Waste of money for me.  I won't even bother to drag my grandchildren through this.  I'll buy the Shirley Temple version and they'll be delighted.",1458172800,2,1794,4.76948051948052

643566,5,630339860X,"We have seen this movie before, which is why I purchased it.  It is by far THE BEST edition of the Heidi story.  A little gruff and realistic in the beginning as she meets scary grandfather, it gets better as his calloused heart slowly begins to soften.  The characters are true, either showing a genuine love for others, or only displaying self-interest (as in the case of Aunt Dete, who really doesn't break out of character).  It wasn't filmed in a fairy-tale like setting, but one that appears more tru-to-life.  Both of my children liked this movie (even my autistic son).  Heidi's perseverance of searching for love and acceptance in this edition makes her the true hero.  You say ""hooray for Heidi"" at the end.",1412467200,3,717,4.688

643724,5,630339860X,"Noley Thornton is the secret of this movie's success; she is absolutely adorable and completely believable as Heidi; her ability as a young actress reminded us both of Margaret O'Brien. Miss Thornton has a remarkable ability to convincingly display a wide range of emotions on her face in a manner that looks completely sincere.

Jason Robards, as Heidi's grandfather, and Patricia Neal, as an elderly neighbor, both turn in effective performances along with Lexi Randall and Jane Seymour. The scenery is glorious as one would expect of the Austrian Alps and the entire ambience of the movie is effective in transporting the viewer to Heidi's world of mountain beauty.

I enjoyed this young lady in Danielle Steel's ""Fine Things"" and found her to be a perfect Heidi.  So glad to add it to my collection and share it with my grandchildren.  I am sometimes irritated by half a dozen previews of other movies before getting down to the movie I bought, this is one time that it paid off.",1297296000,,576,4.296296296296297
643726,1,630339860X,"I chose this movie to watch with my daughter because I had loved the story as a child and thought this would be a great way to introduce her to the story (she's still learning how to read). I have to say that I love the actors, the settings are lovely, and the two-part format works well...However- and this is a BIG one- I don't know why the story was so horribly modified. I know that whenever a book is adapted into a film there have to be changes to have the story adapt to the new format: characters and events may be changed or even cut, etc. What makes a successful book-to-movie adaptation, however, is a respect for the essence and spirit of the story. This adaptation is very flawed and reveals deep misunderstandings of the characters and plot. Do not read further if you don't want any spoilers, but here are the main things that prompted me to give the review only one star:
* Grandfather in the novel is a gentle man who behaves in a curmudgeonly manner because he's seen some ugly sides of life (a brother who lost the family's estate, war, death of a wife and a beloved son). When Dete brings Heidi to him, he's angry at Dete- but never at Heidi. In the movie he's this rabidly angry man who constantly loses his temper in really awful ways. And that ridiculous beginning- with the argument between father and son...what crazy drama was that?? It was needless and rather pointless.
* Clara is a manipulative hypochondriac in the movie. In the novel she is a lonely and quiet little girl who truly loves Heidi and understands when it is time to let her return. There is no guilt tripping, no conditions at Heidi's departure. In the novel Clara's father is a reasonable and moral man who'd never want to cause a child any suffering. Clara's a very sweet and generous child- in the movie she is prone to temper tantrums, jealousy, and selfishness. Clara would never have slapped little Heidi. It was so out-of-character.
* In this film, the Doctor strikes up a little romance with Brigetta. That's his motivation for liking Dorfli, the mountains, and wanting to return. In the book he is a sad widower who has recently lost his only child. He's moved by the kindness and affection shown to him by Heidi and her grandfather and moves to the mountains to pretty much become a part of the family.
*Grandmother is killed off soon after Heidi returns. Why? One of the nicest things that happens in the book is when Heidi returns to the mountains and surprises Grandmother with the fact she can now read. She brings the old woman comfort by reading her the old prayer book. Grandmother is given joy, hope, and health thanks to Heidi and her friends. Why make that very central and important  relationship disappear?
* When Clara and her family leave the mountains, you get the sense that this will be the only and last visit. The feeling is that their worlds just don't mix...But in the novel, you are told that Clara plans on returning to visit her friend and are informed that her father has made a promise to Grandfather regarding Heidi's future and well-being after he passes away.
I don't understand why they felt they needed to change so many key aspects of the story- even the fact that Dete was Heidi's aunt! I guess they wanted to emphasize that Heidi's love transformed her monstrous grandfather, and proceeded to demonstrate that with a clumsy, leaden hand. It's such a waste of a lovely cast (even the little girl who plays Heidi- even though a big deal is made in the novel about how Heidi has dark hair and dark eyes) but the manipulation of the story is disastrous and does not stay true to the novel's spirit.
We'll be looking for another version...or just wait to read the book.",1293926400,31,3702,4.533632286995516
643767,1,630339860X,"I have to agree with the reviewers who can't see much in common with this movie and the book. The first time I tried to watch it, my toddler was in the room and I thought nothing of it since the book is not violent and this adaptation is G-rated. But lo and behold in the first few minutes there is a loud argument (at which point I should have stopped it until she wasn't watching) and then a sudden tragedy involving a falling tree which really upset her. So I learned the hard way to NEVER let her see anything I haven't seen myself unless it's a preschool educational program!

Later I watched maybe a half hour of it then stopped. It was way too tense. In the book, the grandfather immediately makes Heidi at home and is never mean to her, but in the movie he is nothing BUT mean, and Heidi (age 8 instead of the book's 5) has to give him a piece of her mind before he starts being even halfway decent, prior to which he doesn't even offer her entry into the house, food or a bed or anything - totally different from the book. Heck, I'll take the Shirley Temple version over this one as it at least captures the tone better.

Since I'd already read several of the reviews here I decided to stop because it was already just like the negative reviews said it was: the characters too harsh to be much sympathized with, and unnecessary plot changes. As others have said, sometimes it's best just to stick with the book. I think that's the case here since there doesn't seem to be an accurate film adaptation.",1291680000,9,1509,4.2727272727272725

I kept cracking up during the movie, which probably added to my enjoyment of the film.  I've always loved the story of Heidi, but when I was done with this movie, I passed it on to our local library, so other people can enjoy the British accents in this Alpine story.

643817,1,630339860X,"If you know and love the original story (and I mean the unabridged book version) you will probably not like this adaptation.  Heidi is one of our favorite family read-alouds--in fact, we read it for the third time last summer while living temporarily in the Swiss alps.  This movie is radically different in spirit from the book, which is really a redemption story.  In this version, the grandfather is cruel and cold and you really don't see him change too much, except for the obligatory ""hug Heidi"" scene at the end.  Klara is a selfish, manipulative girl who winds up shouting at Heidi, calling her a liar, and telling her she hates her and never wants to see her again.  (My children all agreed that they wished Peter had sent the wheelchair down to its doom with Klara sitting in it.) The grandmother dies.  There is a quasi-happy ending, but let's just say that it doesn't leave you with a lump in your throat or tears in your eyes.  The scenery is gorgeous (although entirely shot in Austria rather than Switzerland) and the beauty of it made watching the movie endurable for me, but I'm very glad I tried it out at Blockbuster first since it's definitely not one I care to own.

Once again I'm left scratching my head as to why the writer and producer thought they could improve on an already near-perfect story.",1187481600,12,1321,4.567796610169491

We also understand that stories have to be changed somewhat to fit time formats, etc.  However, the extent to which this movie has been adapted is beyond reason.  The somewhat horrifying first scene is a complete Hollywood fabrication, which does nothing but detract from the overall story.  Heidi's Grandfather is no longer the grumpy-on-the-outside, but loving-on-the-inside man of the book.  Here he is just a mean old man, with no redeeming qualities at all.  Heidi's initial life on the mountains, and her subsequent removal to the city are fairly close to the original story - again, except where the Grandfather is involved.  However things really start to fall apart about half way through the second act.  Pretty much all of the heart-warming third act of the book, where Heidi returns to the mountains she loves, has been lost to idiotic plot twists and ridiculous melodrama.  Time after time, as this movie played, we looked at each other in astonishment, wondering what had happened to the story we know and love.",1179619200,53,1141,4.901041666666667
643819,5,630339860X,"after a LONG search for this title, i finally found it, and here is my review:

at first glance, this appears to be just another take-off on the old Heidi story. after watching a few minutes, however, it becomes plainly clear that this is no ordinary story, but a dubbed version of the childhood classic, with a changed script...

the story base is the same, but the various line-changes and comic one-liners are something to behold. some of them i had to pause the tape for the lack of ability to contain my laughter! from the initial meeting of Heidi and her grandpa, to Peter, the shepherd (who keeps reminding you he's a goatherd), to Abigail (who's name is really Clara)...it will all make semse (or the lack thereof) once you start watching the short film.

the company who made this version of Heidi, have also done their own versions of Snow White, The Secret Garden, and Alice In Wonderland. and the company who released it (Saban video) were the same people who brought you such classics as ""Inspector Gadget"" (the original cartoon), He-Man, Spider-Man (1994), and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers!

it is a shame, indeed, that this film is out-of-print. much more so that it has never been released on DVD, as it is SO hard to find a DECENT quality copy of it...

if you like humorous takes on classic childrens' stories as much as i do, you will enjoy this short ""classic"" time and again. i give it a 5 out of 5 stars! enjoy :)",1169164800,,1435,4.525096525096525
643820,5,630339860X,"My grandmother was born and raised in Switzerland, moving over to America after WW2. She loved the story of Heidi and bought me a copy of the book while I was still very young. I had seen the Shirley Temple version and while I love Shirley Temple, I really don't think it compares to this version.

  I think what makes this movie so great is that it is untarnished by the ""cutsiness"" that Disney throws into all their movies today. It is a movie that both parents, children, grandparents, etc will all enjoy watching. Noley Thornton fits the role of Heidi perfectly, and I can remember right after seeing this that I proceeded to grow my hair as long as her's and wear it like a crown across my head, similar to the way she did.

  I could go on and on about this movie...it is definitely one that any child from any generation would love.",1157673600,4,840,4.352564102564102
643821,2,630339860X,"Reading over these reviews, I wondered if these people watched the same movie that I watched.  Perception is relative, and relative to the klutzy Shirley Temple version (where the only good thing about the movie was Shirley Temple), this is a good movie--relatively speaking.  Apparently none of these people saw the other versions.

The 1952 version.  Black and white, the film torn to shreds, the sound track nearly unbearable.  But the story and the little girl (dubbed) are delightful and endearing.  They changed the story, and usually when they do that, their version of the story is grossly inferior.  This version is not superior to the book but it is not bad either.  Worth watching.

The 1963 Swiss version.  I have not seen this one but have read good things about it.

The 1968 version.  NBC had a crack at this story.  The scenery is superb, good photography.  Music by John Williams.  They threw in a love story which weakens the movie, and the girl is too old for the part, but she did a good job and Michael Redgrave as the grandfather was superb.  Worth watching and hearing.  Other than the love angle, the story follows the book, although at a fast clip.

The present Disney version.  It looks like people simply imposed their perceptions of the characters from the book onto those in the movie and overlooked any behavior that didn't fit.  In fact, the grandfather is openly hostile and nasty (not just grumpy as in the book).  The child Heidi is almost as bad.  The family in Germany hits you with a reality check: they are not German, though they perfectly portray an ethnic minority in Germany.  The hostility that crackles around the dinner table will grate on anyone who doesn't mask it out or make excuses for it.  The story does follow the book except--and it's an important exception--except in the healing of the crippled girl.  In the book, the grandfather essentially applies physical therapy to the girl, gradually strengthening her legs until she can stand, then helping her take a first step, etc. etc.  This movie version, like all the others, has the girl suddenly start walking due to some extreme situation.  Not credible, but it makes for good cinema.

Historical note: This movie was released on VHS in the early '90s with tons of promotion.  A lot of people bought it.  But once word got around, this movie all but disappeared from the store shelves.  (Anne of Green Gables, by way of comparison, sold steadily from its release date to the present and is still selling.)  I suspect a lot of people will fall for this movie again and buy the DVD, but once word gets around, this movie will once again earn its oblivion.

Bottom line: see this if you want to, but don't be surprised if you have a very different reaction from the people who have posted here.

What we need is a movie that follows the story all the way and that keeps the characters as they are in the book: decent people however grumpy or rigid some of them may be.",1130371200,25,2971,4.628352490421456
