In particular, Phaedra was a sane and nurturing mother to her daughter in the years leading up to her end. She was surely depressed and lonely at times, but she was not crazy.  I hope that people can have more compassion and not call her crazy.",1377475200,,332,4.26984126984127
8092496,5,B000BTM12U,I had seen this movie years ago and decided to purchase it so my friends could see it.  They agreed with me- that girl is crazy as hades!!! I would recommend this movie to anyone.  And if you are dating anyone showing those signs- run and don't look back....,1375920000,,258,4.244897959183674
8092497,2,B000BTM12U,"The movie itself was low budget looking.  The acting wasn't that good either and I didn't understand why the nice girl was dealing with her anyway.. The chic was crazy and she was warned the whole nine.. but of course she has to learn the hard way.  I was looking for less corny love making scenes.. And if the story had more of a plot I think I would have enjoyed it more.  There was no real reason for this woman being nuts! And the other girl (the nice one).. really had no reason to keep seeing her.  Maybe if the director or writer would have explained her disfunctional childhood or some form of abuse it would have been better.  Of course there is a scene or I would say like, images of a man looking gross approaching a girl and the girl is crying.. so clearly something happened but it doesn't really go into detail.. so your left wanting more explaination but you never get it.. and did I say ""corny"".. good luck with this one.. I looked at it once with my girlfriend .. we haven't looked at it again since.. I don't even know where it is.. it's not worth the price.. maybe if it was $5.00 bucks.. but I wouldn't recommend this one at all.",1288310400,,1149,4.228310502283105
8092498,4,B000BTM12U,"I don't know if anyone knows, but this independent film is based on the true story of the late Venus Landin and her lover the late Bisa Niambi who fatally shot Venus three times in 1993, and then turned the gun on herself.

Venus magazine was created in honor of Venus by her friend Charlene Cothran of which I was contributor and co-editor. I've lost touch with Charlene but I hear she's no longer a lesbian....",1205193600,5,412,4.421052631578948
8092499,5,B000BTM12U,"Ohhh this movie was soo damn good its a shame. Its a lil' bit on the low budget side, but its a great movie none the less. This is about a girl named Angel who falls in love with a woman named Phadrea. Phadrea is straight up crazy is hell. Phadrea starts off calm and innocent, to bait Angel into her trap. But we soon find out that she is psycho for real. Phadrea starts cutting herself so she can ""feel"" better and then tries to accuse Angel of cheating on her. There is more to the stroy line, but I don't want to ruin it for you. It will have you on the edge of your seat with a shocking twist in the end! Its has more drama than the ""L-word"" or any lesbian movie that I have ever seen. Its a MUST HAVE collection!",1199577600,5,718,3.9246575342465753
8092500,5,B000BTM12U,"I was able to view this film at a gay/lesbian film festival in Atlanta a few years ago.  The next year, the director and some of the cast members were at the film festival again. They showed the film and gave us some background on the actual characters. Yes, there were severe budget restraints with this movie, but the acting more than makes up for it. I enjoyed the film because it gets right to the point. I feel there was enough background on the characters to let your imagination get you up to speed. I own one of the first copies of the dvd without the extras and still feel I paid a fair price.  I've played this dvd at several times and each time there's always someone talking to the screen telling the characters not to do this or that. I am eagerly awaiting this director's next project! I give this film two thumbs up!",1189641600,2,831,4.286624203821656
8092501,4,B000BTM12U,"This is an independent film, obviously not made with the highest of budget, but for what they were working with, I say they did an excellent job. The plot is very intense, and in my opinion, it was some very good quality acting.  Especially by ""Phaedra"", she was excellent. I was really inspired by this film to look further into independent film making, it's a wonderful market out there to get into.  But to sum it up, the story was definitely unlike any other.  I would love for it to have been more expanded... it seemed like they were in a rush to reach the climax... not a lot of relationship norms in the midst of Phaedras drama... Not enough of the Ups and Downs between displayed to the viewers, to support the intensity of a plot such as this - that's just my opinion (1 star taken off because I felt the plot was somewhat rushed)  I would have liked to see more of the two womens journey together instead of jumping right in... but maybe there was a time frame they were working with... Anyway, sum it up, credit worthy film, Great plot, Great job!",1135036800,8,1059,4.3604060913705585
