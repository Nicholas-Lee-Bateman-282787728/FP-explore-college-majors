8379526,5,B002SRSHF8,"This DVD is great. We already purchased one a year ago and the neighbors loved it, so I bought one for them. Nice to sit and watch the fire or the fish.",1419811200,,152,3.78125
8379527,5,B002SRSHF8,I like to fall asleep with the tv on.....this dvd set is perfect because me to sleep to a soothing image...worth the money,1379462400,,122,4.3478260869565215
8379528,5,B002SRSHF8,"I moved from Jersey to Florida and miss (in the cooler weather) having a fireplace.  I ordered this DVD so I could watch burning logs -- and relax in the evening. You can choose which type of 'flame' you prefer and I like having that option.
The aquarium DVD is also very nice.  Now that the weather is getting warm here in Florida, I am watching the pretty fish swimming around.  The aquarium DVD also has scenes from which one can choose.
After a long day, I like to 'chill' and just go to bed and relax.  Sometimes I read - but I still put one of the DVDs in my tv.  I think it's nice to look at the tv screen, from time to time, and just 'be at peace'. The DVDs contain background sounds also.
As I stated above: watching these DVD's helps bring about a sense of peace within me.
ps:  And you can't beat the price.",1304467200,2,818,4.08125
8379529,3,B002SRSHF8,"Even though the cover looks awesome, the fireplace is good yet disappointing.  The fireplace ""movie"" in the background it looks like the fire is being filmed in a fireproof box.  It's lame looking and doesn't add the real effect.  I was expecting like an actual fireplace like in someone's living room.

The aquarium is also disappointing.  It's ok for someone looking for a quick fix but you can tell it's digitally enhanced.  I can get a better ""aquarium"" off the Finding Nemo dvd.

The whole package is OKAY but i wouldn't suggest others to purchase.",1293840000,,553,4.757894736842105
8379530,3,B002SRSHF8,"I put the fireplace video on for Thanksgiving and each one looks the same except for the fact that the wood is placed differently. It looks like the wood is placed in a fire proof box. The fire is nice but I just wish that they would have filmed a real fireplace instead of the box that it is in. There are 3 diffent scenes and don't get me wrong the quality is nice, but it just looks really fake. As for the fish.....same thing....you can tell that it is someones aquiarium (sp)and not in the ocean. Oh well...I will keep them and probably only use them twice a year.",1290729600,4,569,4.181818181818182
8379531,4,B002SRSHF8,"I bought these DVDs for stress relief and ambiance enhancement.  The Marine Aquarium DVD is wonderful.  I can watch and listen to the aquarium for hours, although I'm disappointed in the fireplace DVD.  The fireplace is visually average, but the audio is sadly lacking.",1288656000,3,269,5.068181818181818
8379532,5,B002SRSHF8,"this is great .... I have the FirePlace burning for all winter already. I love it! It even feels like it is heating my place.
Once the summer hits I will put more the Marine Aquarium. Both are of incredible quality - very much can recommend them.",1265587200,3,246,4.25531914893617
