8204715,3,B000S88JUW,"With some twists that keep you guessing, Lady In The Box (2001) is a pretty entertaining offbeat mystery thriller, where a tavern owner gets involved in a strange affair that includes theft and several murders.  Written and directed by Christian Otjen, this independent production features some odd characters, in some offbeat situations, with a dash of dark humor.

Jerry Holway (Darren Burrows) runs a bar in Milwaukee, located along the shore of Lake Michigan, where his small boat is conveniently moored.  Holoway is offered five hundred dollars by a customer (Mark Sheppard), to dump a wooden chest in the lake, with no questions asked.  Holoway takes his boat out in the middle of the night and completes the task.  When he returns to his apartment, he finds blood and hair on the floor, and his new girlfriend Jill (Paige Rowland) missing.  Believing that Jill may have been in the chest he just chucked overboard, Jerry confides in his friend Chris (Robert Knepper).  Jerry takes his boat to where he dumped the box.  Chris dives down equipped with scuba gear, but is unable to find any trace of the chest.

Shortly thereafter, the mysterious customer reappears at the bar with further instructions for Holoway, who winds up entering an expensive private residence, where he makes some startling discoveries.  Jerry again brings Chris in to help, and both are soon deeply involved in a very deadly game, and Jerry finds himself out on Lake Michigan in the middle of the night, several more times.

Lady In The Box is a fairly entertaining mystery, that while not always credible, features several surprises that keeps things lively.  Aside from a couple of short fights, there are no big action sequences.  Most of the major characters are written to be a little eccentric, which may contribute to the acting not being the greatest.  The story doesn't careen into total absurdity, but it begins to drift that way by the end.  The film may be of interest to mystery fans, with a taste for offbeat indie suspense.",1299888000,2,2019,4.879765395894428

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 It's not every day production of a feature film is centered in the Midwestern gem-of-a-city, Milwaukee. Local filmmaker Christian Otjen has done just that though. He's filmed a tight, gritty noir thriller on the shores of Lake Michigan.

Lady in the Box asks this question: What is $500 really worth?

Darren Burrows (TV's Northern Exposure) plays Jerry, a simple lakeside tavern bartender who finds himself in the middle of a whole heap of trouble. His best friend, Chris (Robert Knepper) is along for the ride as any good friend would be.

The premise is simple enough. A stranger, played maliciously by Mark Sheppard, offers Jerry $500 to dump a large trunk in the lake in the middle of the night. No questions asked. Jerry, against his better judgment but poor enough to entertain the thought, agrees to the proposition. Easy enough, right?

Wrong. He returns home to find his girlfriend missing and blood covering the apartment. It doesn't take Jerry long to assume it was his girlfriend in the box he dumped in the middle of the lake during the night. Plot-twists follow in this Hitchcock-inspired mystery.

Although the film was made on a low budget, production values are outstanding. Director Otjen has a good feel for the genre and builds suspense ably. The atmosphere of the film is one of its highlights. It really feels like it could be happening to any of us. Shot mostly at night in Milwaukee and around the lakefront taverns, it is often difficult to see what's  happening on film. I'm sure this was intentional, to create the right mood, but a little more light would have been better and wouldn't have sacrificed the atmosphere of the picture.

Overall, Lady in the Box is a good film, a B-thriller, with added bonus because it was filmed right here in good ole Milwaukee.

Added Note: The previous review was for the theatrical version of the film. The DVD release by Asylum Home Entertainment leaves me wishing for a little bit more. It's presented well, in picture and sound quality. However, my issues are with lack of extras (there is only the theatrical trailer) and the cover art. I wish Asylum has stuck with the original poster art instead of the cheesy, grade-Z horror movie cover it chose.  In addition, and this is only a pet-peeve of mine, but the credits listed on the back of the DVD is pathetic. No mention of Doomed Productions, which made the film. No mention of the DP or Music.

Bottom Line: Film gets a B-, DVD gets a D.",1194220800,,2910,5.062761506276151
8204718,5,B000S88JUW,"I thought the movie was worth watching, probably because I like offbeat films to begin with. I remember Darren Burrows from Northern Exposure and he's always interesting to watch. The character of ""Tipper"" was played by Robert Glen Keith, who I hadn't heard of before and thought he was very interesting. I thought he was so interesting that I researched him and discovered that he has a web site at robertglenkeith.com where I learned more about this mysterious hot actor. Over all the film was captivating and worth a buy or rent!",1101081600,,532,4.793478260869565
8204719,1,B000S88JUW,"Being a Milwaukeean, and having spent a great deal of time on Lake Michigan, I was intrigued to hear of a movie that is set in my stomping grounds. That is, until I actually saw the movie.
Lady in the Box opens with the first scene taking place at a Milwaukee-famous riverside Pub/Grill Barnacle Buds...the lead character wears a shirt from yet another great, well renowned Milwaukee establishment, Wolski's pub...and if you look carefully, you'll see a boat owned by baseball player / announcer / celebrity, Bob ""Mr. Baseball"" Uecker. And that's where the links to Milwaukee end.
The characters in the story are weak...sorry little people...they lack the gregorious yet humble nature of Midwestern folk. I was so unimpressed with the lack of character development, that I hoped at least I'd find some degree of humor in it...some sort of enjoyment in a thoroughly poor movie...you know...like watching a campy ""B"" movie and getting a few laughs off the poor quality of it all. Alas, this simply wasn't the case. I'll give it ""1"" star...for at least picking a cool venue to do a movie.",991267200,,1085,4.838709677419355
