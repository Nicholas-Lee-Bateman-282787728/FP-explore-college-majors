4924374,5,7799444371,"This sequel is exactly up to par with the first film and in some scenes with its clever gags, even surpasses the original in many scenes. Directors Pierre Coffin (Despicable Me, Minions) and Chris Renaud (Despicable Me, The Lorax) did a wonderful job of keeping a strong family based story and more than relatable characters at the forefront of the film. Ken Daurio (Despicable Me The Lorax) and Cinco Paul (Despicable Me, The Lorax) also came back as the original writers to write this really heartfelt screenplay where the story is a about a new father, his ambition to contribute to society and an unexpected twist, how he, the once evil genius of the world, could ever love or be loved.

 Gru is reprised by amazing Stave Carrell (The Office, 40 Year Old Virgin) again and is recruited by the Ant-Villain League (AVL) to help thwart the new mysterious criminal mastermind trying to take over the world. Kristin Wiig (Bridesmaids, How To train Your Dragon) plays Lucy who is the AVL's leading agent chosen to recruit Gru into their cause. What ensues is nothing short of two fishes out of water who are completly opposites of each other learning that they actually complement each other more then they disagree with each other. Their humor is abundant and their relationships, for an animated feature, is truly genuine.

 Now I can't forget the wonderful performances of the three children Gru has adopted from the first film. Elsie Kate Fisher (Raising Hope, Mike & Molly) plays Agnes, the adorable, curious, extremely sharp and most direct 5 year old you'll ever meet. Her older sisters Edith played by Dana Gainer (30 Rock, Home Makeover) and Margo played by Miranda Cosgrove (The Good Wife, iCarly) seems to be great supportive sisters and surprise, Margo being the oldest, begins to notice boys. Added with everything else, Gru has his hands full, non-stop, throughout the film!

 Gru's number one assistant is back voiced cleverly by Russell Brand (Get Him To The Greek, Arthur) and he has another agenda that also confuses Gru into doing what is right. Now let's add some villains - or some you think are good guys - wink, wink - Benjamin Bratt (Miss Congeniality, Law & Order) plays Eduardo (and his alias) with such witty dialogue in his Mexican accent, you'll be swooned into his charms as well. Steve Coogan (Around The World In 8- Days, Tropic Thunder) plays the head of the AVL and gives Gru more than enough reasons to help them out although the Minions seem to make fun of him all the time.

 Now I am saving the best for last. The Minions are back! Wow, they are funny, clever, dumb-witted, strange, hysterical, bizarre and I could not see a movie without them right next to Gru at his side (top, bottom, left, right, etc.). You'll laugh at their quirkiness and be charmed by their dedication to their boss and his kids. There are hundreds of them this time and they all have their own personalities, specialties and quirks that will make you smile every time one is on screen. Oh, don't leave at the end of the movie during the credits, they have more to offer - keep watching (if you like to laugh that is)!

 Just a pure fun family film and quite a treat to know the sequel is just as good and in some place better, than the original. The adults will have fun with this one and Gru, the girls and the Minions will keep the kids rolling in their seats. Don't miss this one!",1372723200,4,3394,4.632279534109817
4924375,5,7799444371,"I loved this movie and both my daughters loved it even more. It is AS GOOD as the first part, therefore this review follows the main lines of my review of the first ""Despicable me"". This review contains very limited SPOILERS.

1. Hilarity - Exactly as the first film, this sequel is HILARIOUS! There is hardly any 15 seconds in this movie that would not contain a really good gag, children or/and adult oriented. Whoever wrote the scenario was a genius!

2. Despicability - in this film Gru is a little bit different from what he was in the first part. He is no more so grumpy, mean, petty and permanently aggravated - he certainly smiles more and all his attitude softened. He remains however exactly as insecure as in the first film. That being said, there are moments in this film when the old Gru resurfaces, when his heart is broken or when somebody REALLY upsets him. His geriatric sidekick and only friend (well, kind of) doctor Nefario didn't take all this change easily and he has some trouble to adapt his evil laboratory to new tasks of producing jam and jelly... Gru's murderous (and toxic) dog/rat/wolverine/skunk like pet on another hand felt completely under the spell of the girls - but still gives a great show! The two ""bad guys"" are also excellent - which is a real achievement, considering that one of them belongs to species usually not associated with evil villainy...)))

3. Girl power - as in the previous film, I believe that any parent of little girls will fall immediately in love with Margo, Edith and Agnes, the three little orphaned sisters Gru adopted in the first part. Those seemingly defenseless creatures took him since under the sweet and soft but in the same time surprisingly totalitarian control little girls exercise over their fathers, adoptive or not...))) Agnes, the youngest of the three (I think she is 5) is still particularly sweet - if only she was real I would adopt her on the spot and spoil her silly all the rest of my life! Tomboyish Edith, aged around 8, still wears permanently her pink hat which seems to comfort her, but as you will see, she certainly recovered from her previous traumas...))) Margo, the oldest one, is now a young teenager (she is about 13 I think) and starts already to think about boys, something which TERMINALLY freaks Gru out - and I can relate here! Honest, if you already are a parent of a little girl, you WILL LOVE this movie. And if you do not have yet a young daughter, get one!

4. As in previous film, as far as reasons to watch this movie go, even the girls must cede the first place to the minions! The totally devoted, fearless and highly professional and in the same time impossibly immature and conflicted army of Gru minions is THE greatest treasure of this movie. In this film there is even more minions and believe me - they pack incredible fun! I am very impatient to see their own film (which I believe will be released in 2014).

5. Agent Lucy Wilde, a young rising star in the Anti Villain League, is a new element and a new delight added to this film and her character is a great success. Well trained in martial arts and using some extremely cool gadgets, she is also a mixture of perfect lady and a tomboyish, contagiously enthusiastic adventurer, still lacking a little bit of experience and therefore prone to attack first and ask questions later...))) And she is also cute, which certainly doesn't hurt.

I purposefully omitted in this review some of the characters and did not hint at most of the gags and scenes, to avoid big spoilers and keep things short.

To conclude, this is a TREASURE OF A MOVIE. A thing to see in cinema, then buy on DVD, watch, keep and re-watch on regular basis. And I ABSOLUTELY hope for A SECOND SEQUEL!

PS. LONG LIVE MINIONS!",1372636800,251,3763,4.564444444444445
4924376,4,7799444371,"Didja love The Minions last time? I know I did! So I'm happy to report those little yellow fireplugs are back...in FORCE! It is clear that the filmmakers knew how much the children loved them; AND like last time, they saved their best 3D effects for the final credits, so I $ugge$t you $kip tho$e extra charge$ unless you already have your 3D DVD player from Amazon.

Our hero is asked to come out of retirement to help find a villain who can inject the sweetest creature with a serum that turns it into an indestructible force for Evil. Gru would rather stay home and host a birthday party for one of his beloved daughters, so he turns down the job.

In this PG family outing:
  * Steve Carell (""Hope Springs"") returns as Gru, our favorite villain-turned-marshmallow, the fellow who adopted three little girls under false pretenses in the first Despicable Me, then learned how to read bedtime stories and become a really good father.
  * Kristen Wiig (""Bridesmaids"") is Lucy, our hero's sidekick, a pretty tough cookie who obviously has a ""thing"" for him.
  * Benjamin Bratt (""Snitch"") is Eduardo/El Macho, the proprietor of a Mexican-food place in the mall.
  * Moises Arias (""The Kings of Summer"") is Antonio, the muy guapo heartthrob who sweeps Gru's dazzled daughter Margo off her feet.
  * Miranda Cosgrove (""Despicable Me"") is Margo, the oldest of Gru's three girls, just entering her hormonal years...to her father's dismay.
  * Russell Brand (""Rock of Ages"") is Gru's assistant Dr. Nefario, who leaves his employment for a better deal.

At the theatrical screening this week, I enjoyed the children's giggles of delight with The Minions and I appreciated the well-balanced parenting I saw from Gru. (Those are the nicest little girls!) In addition, it always pleases me to see some professional voice artists used in these projects, so kudos to the casting folks! The grandparents in my JayFlix.net group will love showing this one to the little 'uns.",1372464000,6,1960,4.86144578313253
4924377,3,7799444371,"GREAT movie (probably better than the original), but the ""HD Bonus Edition"" version doesn't work in Movies Anywhere!!!  For those that may be buying the streaming version, it will not show up in your other movie apps like Vudu, Google Play, etc via the Movies Anywhere app.  Most of my Amazon streaming movies that I purchase will show up in my Movies Anywhere.  The ""HD Bonus Edition"" of Despicable Me 2 will not, but I think the regular version of Despicable Me 2 will.

P.S.  People we've talked to sometimes get the various Minions-related movies mixed up.  Please note that we do NOT recommend the first Minions movie, which has the character Scarlett Overkill...my eldest copies her every movement and motion.  We tried to allow her to watch that Minions movie and tried to teach her not to copy Scarlett's bad traits and actions but we were not successful. So, while she's in this phase (2.5-3 yrs), we have decided to temporarily move it to our hidden DVD library :) until she's older and better able to understand our guidance.  Other than Scarlett Overkill, whose character is too ""over"" the top for me, the Minions movie is funny and well-done; but, it is only suitable for older kids.  I'm not an expert, but my personal recommendation would be for children at least 7-8 years old, depending on each child's maturity progression.",1500940800,,984,4.891566265060241

Together they are undercover at the mall at a bakery to find who is turning animals into blue monsters. There Gru suspects Eduarado (Benjamin Bratt), the owner of a Mexican restaurant of being a former villain named El Macho. While someone is taking Gru's hilarious Minions!
Gru bonding with a woman instead of the kids is smarter than just giving us a similar story all over again. While I laughed a lot and there was plenty of charm but in the end I felt it could have been a little longer since the story could have been just a bit stronger.

If I were homosexual, I wouldn't laugh, I would be embarrassed at the insinuation that I'm funny because of my lifestyle or things I want to do.  I rated this a one star for the various scenes I am talking about and anyone who watched this knows which ones they are.  I believe that the majority of homosexual behavior is a choice and if that is how someone chooses to live, then alright.  I do not believe it is a healthy lifestyle I want to suggest to my daughter as healthy.",1489363200,,596,4.381818181818182

4924630,3,7799444371,"Picking up right where the original left off, evil genius Gru has seen the error of his ways and transitioned into life as the single, adoptive dad of three young girls. The sudden reform has left everyone (an army of minions, a long-time collaborator and Gru himself) a bit stir-crazy, so he seeks new thrills as a turncoat, tracking and identifying his former rivals for a stuffy government agency. Illumination has leveled-up their equipment since the first film, which makes for a far more polished visual product, but the story is less lively and fuzzy than its surprising predecessor. Of course the minions are everywhere, getting the star treatment before their inevitable spinoff, but the girls are relegated to watery secondary storylines and there seem to be a lot of missed opportunities. Gru's job with the g-men, for instance, seems like a ready-made setup for introducing all sorts of wacky new characters and enlarging the world, but instead it merely hones in on a single new villain and ventures no further. The introduction of a love interest is hesitant, overly convenient, and never really clicks. There's plenty of fun stuff for younger audiences, of course, and some of the sight gags are clever, but most parents will find themselves daydreaming through the bulk of this one.",1488931200,,1298,5.013888888888889

4924635,3,7799444371,"Generally OK, but seriously, did no one during writing and production think that the part with the 3 little girls left alone at the mall was downright disturbing?  Bad enough but then the older girl (maybe 10) leaves the 4 yr. old and the 5 yr. old completely by themselves while she goes on a ""date"" at a restaurant.  Gru is seen as not cool that he has a problem with her being with a boy by herself on a date no less.  Very, very odd and with that many people involved in the movie you'd think one of them at least would raise a concern for a change in script.  Strange at best and red flags all over the place at worst.",1488240000,,623,4.040650406504065

It is a movie both kids and parents can enjoy, with kid friendly humor, secret agents, the goofy minions, romance, and it is adorable seeing the relationship between Gru and his adopted daughters progress. This is up their on my list of favorite movies and I would highly recommend it to anyone.

As a side note, I couldn't get amazon's video service to work with my chrome cast through my iPhone, so I ended up sending it to the screen via a computer instead. That is not a problem with the movie itself, but something to keep in mind if you buy it digitally with the hope of immediately streaming it to your chrome cast like I did.",1484179200,,753,4.378571428571429

4924867,4,7799444371,"I can't believe I loved this movie.  I anticipated hating it.  I thought that people that were super into Despicable Me were weird.  I thought that the mumbling minions were dumb.  I thought their association with Burger King was strange at best.  But when my 4-year-old twins wanted desperately to watch it, I finally succumbed.  And I lol'ed.  It was actually good.  Kudos, Steve Carell.  Turns out you're not the worst after all.

Here's Ebert's review.  I can't give you anything more in-depth than that.

I enjoyed 2010's ""Despicable Me"" immensely, so I approached ""Despicable Me 2"" with a wary eye. ""Despicable Me"" told a funny, sweet, self-contained story about a guy named Gru (Steve Carrell) who renounces villainy and embraces fatherhood. It ended on a note that required no further speculation. Satisfied viewers like me sang ""So Long, Farewell"" to Gru and his crew. Reps at Universal looked at ""Despicable Me's"" $251 million dollar domestic box office gross and sang ""Never Can Say Goodbye."" So, another summer weekend brings another summer sequel.

WATCH NOW

""Despicable Me 2"" is as serviceable as it is unnecessary. Therein lies the rub for me. Here I sit on the fence between 2-1/2 and 3 stars, unsure of where I will fall. On the ""thumbs down"" side, there's dissatisfaction with a returning hero who is far blander than his original incarnation; he's been neutered by the one thing that made ""Despicable Me""'s ending so satisfying. On the ""thumbs-up"" side is a series of clever touches made with love and attention by cast and crew. These moments are so good I almost feel despicable for being undecided. So this review is a battle between Evil Film Critic Odie and Emotional Moviegoer Odie. You have a luxury I currently do not: You can look at the star rating above and see who won.
The opening of ""Despicable Me 2"" is an example of its brash cleverness. An entire intelligence team and their outpost is attacked by a huge horseshoe magnet straight out of that Warner Bros. cartoon subsidiary, The Acme Company. Almost everyone and everything is pulled comically into the sky and relocated, save for a port-a-potty and its terrified inhabitant. This act of vandalism attracts the attention of the AVI, an organization that tracks and reports the kind of villainy Gru partook in back in the days of  ""Despicable Me."" The AVI sends out agent Lucy (Kristen Wiig) to ask Gru to use his powers of villainous deduction to figure out who's behind these extreme demonstrations of magnetic personality. Lucy's idea of asking nicely is electrocuting Gru with a ""lipstick taser"" before tossing him into the trunk of her superspy car-slash-plane-slash-boat.
Before his Meet Cute with Lucy, Gru was living a boring, domesticated life. Now retired, the only despicable act he is perpetrating on society is a series of horrific tasting jams and jellies. It drives his colleague Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) to resign and take a position with a new villain. Gru's new project will help his undercover operation as a vendor at the local mall. Lucy believes the mastermind AVI seeks is one of the other store owners at the mall. Suspects include a hairdresser, whose appearance conjures up images of ""Shampoo"" recast with Paul Williams, and an extremely masculine Mexican restaurant owner whom Gru thinks bears strong resemblance to a bad guy named ""El Macho."" Since El Macho es muerte (his death scene will put hair on your chest), Gru is immediately suspicious.
Al Pacino was supposed to play Eduardo, the guy Gru thinks is El Macho. Al left the movie, but his accent apparently remained. Benjamin Bratt picks up the most over-the-top Hispanic accent since Tony Montana and runs a marathon with it. His line readings are a blast, though some viewers might find Eduardo somewhat politically incorrect. Whether Eduardo is El Macho isn't important; he brings much needed spark to ""Despicable Me 2,"" upstaging Gru at every turn. In fact, until the climax, everyone upstages Gru. Carrell's accented line readings are still a pleasure, but I wanted more of the old Gru's scheming.
""Despicable Me 2"" does offer a few flashes of what endeared me to its hero in the first place. Gru's suspicions about Eduardo increases tenfold when his eldest daughter Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) feasts her eyes on Eduardo's teenage son Antonio (Moises Arias). Gru's amusingly unsuccessful (and rather mean) attempts to keep Margo from growing up have a familiar ring of disaster for any dad raising a daughter. Gru even brings his freeze gun out of retirement to cool Antonio's raging hormones, though he aims it at the wrong parts of this lothario.
While Gru worries about Margo's love life, she and her sisters Agnes (Elsie Fisher) and Edith (Dana Gaier) worry about his, even setting him up on vHarmony (or whatever that dating site is that caters to the wrong side of the law). When Agnes sees Lucy, she correctly pegs that Gru has a thing for her. This potential Mommy subplot is designed to inject emotion into ""Despicable Me 2."" While it works for the most part (Agnes' big, expression-filled eyes are the animators' most glorious creations), nothing in the sequel comes as close to yanking my heartstrings as the moment when Gru, literally caught between the moon and New York City in the original, sees that pink ballet recital ticket floating in space.
""Despicable Me 2"" lags on occasion, but every time I found my attention waning, the filmmakers did something wicked to goose me. Many of these moments involve my second favorite thing about ""Despicable Me,"" Gru's minions. The cheerful little yellow creatures with overalls become integral plot points this time, undergoing a Gremlins-style metamorphosis to the dark side courtesy of our mystery villain. This leads to a nod to Philip Kaufman's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" that, dare I say, is worth the price of admission. The minions also figure in the second dressed-in-all-white homage to '90s music to appear in a 2013 summer film. I laughed so hard I almost spat out my soda. It was at that moment that I found myself torn about my star rating.
This is where you came in. While I remain disappointed that the sequel gives me a subdued Gru and an uneven pace, I keep remembering things about ""Despicable Me 2"" that make me smile. For every meh moment, there's almost 2 well-conceived gags or lines. The voice talent remains top-notch, with Wiig, Bratt, Steve Coogan and the returning Russell Brand as stand-outs. The 3-D, as far as I can tell, is quite good, especially during the closing credits. (Full disclosure: like some of Gru's minions, I've only got one working eye, which turns 3-D into 2.25-D.) Some of the minor plot points pay off big time. I'm as enamored of the Pharrell Williams songs in this one as I was in the first film (and they're well used). And directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, and screenwriters Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul milk a few sweet moments of genuine emotional heft from the relationship between Gru and his kids.
With all that in mind, I have decided to award three stars to ""Despicable Me 2."" Besides, the Evil Film Critic has to win sometimes.",1472342400,,7133,4.883471074380165

4924886,5,7799444371,"Despicable Me 2
 I watched this kids animated feature in a theater filled to capacity with 3 to 9 year olds and their minders.  Kids will let you know immediately if they like or dislike a movie.  They liked this one and laughed and laughed through the whole thing.  So did I.  This sequel to Despicable Me rates a very high four saw blades.  If you want to go see something that you can safely take your children or grand children to, this PG animated film is the best choice this week.  I think you will laugh right along with the wee ones.
 The bad guy from the first film has been re-rehabilitated and now is the good guy.  He is aided by a horde of little short yellow creatures, his minions.  The minions are manic little screw balls who speak something that sounds like it might be a Martian variant of Italian.  These guys are funny as all get out, pulling every stunt imagined in Vaudeville or the old black and white comic films.  Not to give anything away, but just for your information, at a solemn ceremony the minions fire off an honorary 21 fart gun salute.  The kids and I ate it up.
 There is also a romance between the secret agent heroine and the badly emotionally damaged hero which was interesting.
 This superior childrens film was directed by the duo that directed the first film, Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud.  Despicable Me did $543 million worldwide and the sequel deserves to do just as well.  One hour and 38 minutes.",1470614400,,1447,4.420454545454546

This is a story that all parents can relate to- we're never ready for our kids to grow up and we'll do anything to keep them safe!

4925362,1,7799444371,"[spoiler alert]
I was terribly disappointed by this film. I wasn't expecting a masterpiece of cinema art, but I thought it would at least have a plot. Nope. Nobody changes throughout the entire film. The ""conflict"" is a villain whom Gru pegs as a villain on sight. The villain acts very evil, and Gru acts very good and stops him. The characters are kept quite safe from any introspection, difficult decisions, sacrifices, etc.

The whole thing appears to be written by a committee of executives dedicated to ensuring that this profitable franchise didn't mess up and spoil the revenue with anything unpredictable. They inserted all the ""good"" characters from the last movie as static characters plus a few more good and evil characters - all static, of course. With a big enough animation budget and enough minion slapstick, what could go wrong?

There were a few good one-liners and funny gags. I did laugh now and then, but it won't work on the second viewing.

There were also a few points at which it almost developed an interesting subplot or two. Gru almost has a conflict with his teenage daughter, Margo, who was courted by the villain's teenage son. But then junior goes after another girl at the party with exactly the same pickups, and Margo realizes how right Gru was and snaps back to the way she was before. Story avoided!

Later, when Gru and family are storming the villain's house (yes, Gru permits his daughters to join a dangerous battle without batting an eye), junior was apparently deleted. I kept expecting that Margo and he would have some sort of awkward confrontation while she ran around his mansion shooting stuff, but nope. Story avoided!

Dr. Nefario gets a new job with the villain and mistreats minions for their new projects, but unhesitatingly defects back to Gru at the first opportunity. Neither the villain or ex-villain seem bothered by his lack of human emotions and random decision-making processes, and both happy accept whatever he does.

Some friend assured me this was a good movie before I bought it without any checking reviews. He or she is lucky I forgot who told me that, or else I'd have some choice feedback for that friend! :-D

4925378,5,7799444371,"Yeah, I couldn't wait until release day for Despicable Me 2.  The original
Blu-ray was once at the very top of my Top Must Own 3D Titles list, and knowing
how much the animators favored pop-out effects, I was certain going into this
film that it would aim to please.  I was not disappointed....and neither will you.

Picking up some short time after the original film, we find Gru (Steve Carell)
retired from being a super villain as he concentrates on being a father and a
legitimate businessman. You know, instead of blowing things up and creating
general havoc, he he's entertaining young kids at a Birthday party, dressed as
a fairy princess. However, that life suddenly comes to a screeching halt when
an agent named Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) persuades Gru to help the Anti Villain
League hunt down a mastermind who has taken off with a secret formula that
turns innocent people into monsters.

With most all of the original cast and filmmakers returning for this sequel,
Despicable Me 2 aims higher than its predecessor thanks to the amount of
emphasis that is placed on its unusual stars, the Minions.  This was a smart
thing to do given the fact that any scene with these lovable creatures manages
to get the biggest laughs, while the rest of the film sort of ""hits"" or ""misses"" when
it comes to trying to retain the magic of the original.

It becomes rather impossible to say anything negative about an animated
transfer like this that has been created entirely within the digital realm.  It's
virtually flawless, with its vivid palette of colors and razor-sharp images that
beautifully detail the film's tremendous animation efforts.  I really loved watching
the scenes that take place in the Minion tropical paradise.  I think they show off
the most impressive levels of color from deep sky blues to the banana yellows of
the Minions themselves. Black levels are something to behold here as well,
particularly evident in young Agnes's (Elsie Fisher) hair or Dr. Nefario's (Russell
Brand) gloves.  This is a transfer that is going to really make your display show
its worth.

As for the 3D, it's got a lot going for it as well.  First, there is an ample amount of
depth that separates foreground and background objects.  Animation is perfectly
layered throughout the film so that certain objects (such as overhead light fixtures)
stand more prominently forward than everything else.  The use of descriptive
computer overlay gives a very nice 3D effect. Of course, as with the original film,
Despicable Me 2 plays to its audience, taking every opportunity it can to throw
props outwards.  From an inflatable pony, to unraveling party horns, to floating
shards of glass -- there is always something coming at the audience.  Look at Gru's
nose and the way it always seems to poke itself out of the screen. Unfortunately,
outside of a few character hand extends, the outward reach seems rather limited
for the in-film content.  The real deal comes during the ending credits (which you
must watch completely through), where various objects mishandled by the Minions
come the furthest forward.  These are the real 3D moments to savor.  I suppose
Universal was afraid viewers would skip the credits so they have included most (or all)
of the credit hijinks in the opening menu.

Ghosting issues are ever-so minor.  In fact, outside of the ghosting on the opening
credits (same problem as the original film) and a bubble sequence during the
closing credits, I hardly noticed any issues on my active shutter display.

Despicable Me 2 features a 5.1 DTS-MA track that is just as engaging as the film
itself.  Effects work their way effortlessly across the channels.  Dialogue is clear
throughout while the film's music seems to get even distribution around the entire
sound field.  LFE is very much present in some of the film's action sequences,
particularly those involving the flying magnet.  There's a lot of toe-tapping musical
moments to enjoy here.  I was most pleased that one of my favorite instrumentals
by Barry White's Love Unlimited Orchestra was included.

Despicable Me 2 arrives as a 3-Disc set (Blu-ray 3d+Blu-ray+DVD and Digital HD)
housed in a really cool lenticular cardboard slipcover that features a blown party
favor.  There's a wealth of extra material that I really didn't have time to spend with,
but I did take the opportunity to watch one of the three included mini-movies (the
only one in 3D), Puppy.  It's actually a very cute short that features great dimensional
depth (though no pop-out).

Despicable Me 2 falls a bit short of the original, but still remains quite funny thanks
to the time that is spent with its lovable Minions.  I can't get enough of those little
guys and I look forward to their own spin-off feature in 2014.

Meanwhile, this is yet another ""must have"" release for anyone that wants to enjoy the
full potential their 3D display has to offer.  Despicable Me 2 is just plain ""fun"" and it
makes for one of the very best 3D releases of 2013.",1453075200,5,4990,4.845518867924528

As that was one of the primary reasons for which I purchased the set, I found this fact highly disappointing. While I did see the ""Import"" in the description, I was not aware of the implied regional restrictions and do, honestly feel that the vendor,  The Valhalla Group, should have stated in their description that this was not, as are many, Region Free. Although it might pain my Nordic forbears, I shall avoid Valhalla in the future, at least in the matter of purchases (I wonder, did Loki put this on-line...?)",1447459200,3,664,4.627118644067797

4925810,5,7799444371,"Released in 2013, Despicable Me 2 is the sequel to the hit 2010 animated film. This time Gru is propositioned by the Anti-Villain League and teams up with Agent Lucy Wilde to find out who stole a mutagen known as PX-41, which turns subjects into aggressive monsters. Gru is convinced that the presumed dead supervillain, El Macho, is responsible while the leader of the Anti-Villain League concludes hes incompetent. Meanwhile Gru goes on his first date, many of his Minions are kidnapped and Margo becomes infatuated by a boy at the mall.

Like the original, Despicable Me 2 is zany, consistently amusing and often laugh-out-loud funny. Its hard to determine which ones better as its simply a continuation of the story with a more James Bond bent and a smidgen of Gremlins. Lucys a great addition and you cant help but hope a Mulder-Scully relationship develops between Gru and Lucy.

The movie runs 98 minutes.

4926073,5,7799444371,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. So many funny parts! Of course, there are highlights.......

1. Gru is having a birthday party  to celebrate Agnes' birthday. It is really well...minions hitting each other, Gru gets pulled down when acting like the fairy princess. All is well...or is it?

2. Jillian (however you spell it) is trying to make Gru date, but he doesn't want to date. So problem.

3. Apparently he needs to go to a place were he is needed to be a spy. So someone comes to get him....Lucy Wilde. It doesn't end all good.

4. He is taken to the place where he discovers that there is this place that makes purple bunnies. Cute...But very deadly. It has been taken by a magnet thing. Moving on....

5. At first Gru doesn't want to take the job but then he does. So good for you! No, really. That's nice. Now how do I entertain my kids...

6. Gru comes to a cupcake store where they are looking for something. Then there is this person who comes in- El Macho (his real name is really hard to write and pronounce. You get the idea though). So what happens next?

7. Gru comes home after a day of work to tuck in his kids. But he is really breaking into the Salsa And Salsa restaurant. So they get to work finding a purple thing.

Well the buck stops here. What will Gru do next? Will Gru and Lucy fall in love or just be partners? I wonder... what will happen?...

I am Stephanie Cotton and I am 30 years old and I live in Willistion, Vermont. I hope you like my review. Happy watching this funny movie! I wonder.....",1438819200,,1541,4.210884353741497

4926613,4,7799444371,"I had no desire to see the original Despicable Me, however some friends talked me into watching it with them, and I fell in love.  Now Ive gotten to see Despicable Me 2, and I enjoyed it as well, although it wasn't quite as good.

Gru (voiced by Steve Carrell) has given up his evil villain ways and settled into life as a single dad to Margo, Edith, and Agnes (Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier, and Elsie Fisher).  Hes trying to create a line of jellies and jams and gives fairy princess birthday parties.  The worst problem he has is dodging his neighbors attempts to set him up with her friends.

All that changes when Lucy (Kristen Wiig) walks into his life.  Shes from the AVL (that's the Anti-Villain League) and she needs his help.  An entire research lab has been stolen from the North Pole, and it included a very dangerous transformation serum.  Can Gru help her get it back?

Those looking to laugh will certainly be rewarded here.  This is a comedy that kids and parents will both laugh at.  When I watched it, it was with two adult friends, and we were all laughing very hard at the story and lines.  Yet their young kids enjoy it, too.

The plot is fairly predictable.  I didn't get all the twists along the way, but I saw several of them coming early.  That didn't dampen my enjoyment since the laughs kept coming.

However, one thing I loved about the first movie was the charm the three girls introduced to things and how that interplay affected Gru.  That wasn't here this time; in fact, the girls are more supporting players than main characters.  While Gru and Lucy share some great scenes, it wasn't quite the same.

The voice cast is wonderful.  They do a good job of bringing their characters to life and keeping a consistent voice that isn't necessarily their normal voice.  That allows me to get lost in the story without picturing the actor saying their lines.

The animation doesnt go for the hyper realism of Pixar or Disney, but the stylized animation presented here is perfect for the story.  Actually, I think it helps with the laughs at times.

Plus, how could you realistically create the Minions?  These little yellow guys once again steal the show and provide some of the best laughs.

So if you were a fan of the first, be sure to watch Despicable Me 2.  While not quite as good as the original, it still provides plenty of laughs.",1434240000,,2363,4.498823529411765

4926649,4,7799444371,"I could not get into the original Despicable Me, but I liked this movie a lot better. Its environment is still funny in relation with its franchise and a lot of fun. The minions are still really funny, and the three girls are settled in with Gru like normal adopted daughters. Also, since Gru is a loving father, there is legitimate balance with his clumsiness and his sometimes violent behavior. Another thing I like about this movie is its heart. Agnes seems to be the closest to Gru in this movie and wants a mommy, which foreshadows what the movie is going to be anout. And speaking of which, Lucy is another great new aspect. She is funny, quick, and really sweet. When Gru was dating that other weird woman, I was afraid Lucy would accuse him of cheating on her-but no! She helps him get rid of her! I really liked that. I also though the song ""Happy"" was really catchy-heck, they played it at my cousin's wedding last year! My only problem is, like the first, Dr. Nefario. He still doesn't really change, he still isn't funny-yeah. He does help Gru and the girls stop the badguy in the climax, but I am still not really a fan of that guy. But everything else in this movie is very delightful and fun. So far, I think this is the best out of the Despicable Me franchise.",1433721600,,1276,4.3655462184873945

4926718,1,7799444371,"If I could gives this sorry movie zero stars I would.  This movie portrays every racist stereotype about Mexicans in this movie.  You want to cast a latino villain, cool go for it.  In fact it's a nice change and makes things interesting.  But the character is a joke.  Big mustache, huge gold chain, and of course the accent.  How else can you tell a Mexican apart in movies right? they need to speak with accents.  I stopped watching the movie when Gru discovers Eduardo's lair.  Movies like these are the main reason why I don't even bother watching any of the Racist hollywood garbage spews out.  I know there are a lot of apologists out there, it's all in good fun, you have to be able to laugh at yourself nonsense.  However, this is the only way Hollywood wishes to represent Latinos in movies, by stereotyping the hell out of their characters.",1432512000,4,851,4.503267973856209

This absolutely should have won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film over ""Frozen,"" which was riding the ""Let It Go"" hype at the time of the awards season. The minions are a catchy, brilliant creation and I'll take the message of love that Gru has for his adopted girls and how love of family an conquer evil over the syrupy ""I choose my sister over a man"" silliness that ""Frozen"" represents. This movie will stand the test of time...great vocal acting and writing. We finally get to see the fart gun in action!! ""I'm not afraid of your jelly guns.""

This movie is a great follow-up to the original Despicable Me and is just the thing if you are looking for more of your favorite villain, Gru, his three adopted daughters, and the adorable minions.

4927285,5,7799444371,"Okay the movie is just too cute to comprehend with words alone! The Minions and their mini movies are just adorable as well, any person young or old would fall in love. My favorite scene, which I kinda teared when I saw it in the theaters, was when the minions do their ""I Swear"" Boys II Men cover. I'm glad I waited to buy the movie until this Holiday gift set came out because you get everything PLUS the minion ornament(I think everyone gets the one shown right on the box). The ornament is about an inch and 1/2, comes with a gold string attached already to hang up.
According to one of the reviewers (from what I understood)the digital copy redemption thru [universal hi def. com] only showed a limited amount of retailers were you can fulfill the process, but when I did it, I saw at least 6 different ones, including UV/Flixster, VUDU, Cinema Now,etc. It also gave me the option to download straight to Itunes seperately. Yes your usually given 1 code per dvd/Bluray, and most digital copies are for UV/Flixster or just for 1 specific website but you can access it thru various devices/methods.

They lose one star for making me look up their support email and jump through hoops to get the digital download. On the plus side they didn't try to foist ultra violet on me, I was able to chose iTunes for my download.

Original Review:
The movie is great. The product sold is a rip off. The digital download disc WILL NOT WORK if you try to use it after 12/31/2014. Don't waste your money on this version, get one without the digital download. And if you want the digital download, well you'll have to find some other means because apparently hollywood doesn't want to sell it to you. (But they will take your money letting you believe that you are getting it).
Why they set an artificial expiration date I have no idea. There's no good reason for it.",1420156800,6,831,4.396103896103896

We're big fans of the first one and Illumination killed it with this sequel. I love Lucy (funny how that came out [Kristin Wiig's character]) and El Macho.

Looking forward to the Minion movie.",1420070400,,231,4.476190476190476

4927374,3,7799444371,"Wow. There are so many things in this movie...its great for adults and teens and maybe even tweens but it was scary for our girls (4) who were devastated when the minions got turned purple etc....we told them they'd be changed back BC in Disney we knew of course they would be but they did NOT like the movie overall bc of that....loved it otherwise prior to that and after that! That was about a half hour of the movie I'd say? But there were so many ""gray* areas (a minion with butt cheeks that threw off his clothes to swim, a tweenish love thing going on that was funny BC of the dad yet too old for young kids....) Hmmm definitely a funny movie for teens and adults but too young for our crew...will hold onto it for later...worth looling up the ""plugged in"" review for sure there's so much I didn't even mention but especially the scariness and gray areas ....",1419897600,,866,4.319018404907975

4927404,4,7799444371,This is a really cute movie.  My son is 4 years old and was a bit scared of the first movie because Gru's dog/monster pet scared him a little at the beginning.  I like this movie better than the first because there is less scary parts and it is a bit better for toddlers and preschoolers (although I'm an adult and love this movie too).  I like how you get to see the sweet side of Gru for longer in this movie.  It was nice to see Gru had softened since becoming a parent and this time around was trying to stop a different villain from causing trouble.  I think this is a great family movie.,1419724800,,593,4.077586206896552

4927587,1,7799444371,"So disappointing.

I was really looking forward to watching this movie after hearing so many people enjoyed and Kristen Wiig is in it and she has done fabulous work in the How to Train Your Dragon franchise, plus I love the first Despicable Me!

But this movie just got worse and worse. I mean, the mall thing, the boyfriend, the cupcakes, the villain.  I think they tried to make it like a plot twister when they ""thought"" someone else was the villain. We knew the truth all along.

And probably the movies worst quality... The minions. I really dislike minions. They are so annoying, and even though this movie already didn't have too much going for it, it really went downhill when most of the movie displayed the minions. Look, I understand they're extremely popular, but that doesn't give you any reason to make a movie about them and give all of the lines to them.

I really don't understand how Minions 2015 is going to work... I mean, an entire movie about these characters that make absolutely no sense? I just don't see it working.

I really don't understand how films like Despicable Me and Frozen are extremely overrated, (Frozen is okay), but films like How to Train Your Dragon and Big Hero 6 aren't? It doesn't make any sense.

But, I love the first one. It had SO much heart, love, and the girls getting a dad is so sweet. It has everything Despicable Me 2 wishes it was.",1417910400,2,1387,4.50199203187251

4927599,3,7799444371,"This is a cute movie that adults can like just as much as kid. The reason for the three stars rather than five is that they have a very limited list where you can redeem your digital code- this does not include Amazon.

It's subtly incorporated into almost every scene of the movie to give depth to characters and really give you a sense of who's in the foreground and who's in the background.  The visual gags are richer and the minions... oh the minions are just perfect.  You haven't really experienced this movie until you've seen it in 3D!,1416873600,5,412,4.54054054054054

4928389,4,7799444371,"This is reviewed from the points of view of a 4 year old boy and his decidedly middle aged father. Frankly  we loved it! It is a heap of fun and doesnt outstay its welcome. The visuals are excellent from the amusingly exaggerated body shapes to the fascinating yellow Minions. The more serious a character, the less anatomical distortion though. Gru is fabulous. He really puts on some humourous moves, particularly in his delightful take on Pharrels Happy. In fact the soundtrack is spot on. There is a great mix of music that should give all audience members something to enjoy. So too the pop-culture gags. From Star Wars to the Village People for the older types and a heap of James Bond type stuff too. The winner though for the littlies is of course the Minions. I had little idea what they were saying but their slap-stick had my son giggling endlessly. Often we laughed at different things, at different times but at the end wed both had a great time. So good, he wants to watch it again and again  with me. You cant get more family friendly than that! Highly recommended!",1407283200,,1080,4.561855670103093

Then there are the Minions who are . . . well, they're Minions, they are adorable, funny and as absurd as the story. Love the Minions.
 I really liked this piece of animation but since I collect animation I must in some ways compare it to the other classics in my library. If I could rate the fifth star as a shinning star of one that is slightly dim I would do just that or some variation.
So with all due consideration, respect and admiration for this effort, I rate this adorable film with the highest 4 star rating I can give it.

4928610,4,7799444371,"What made Despicable Me (1) great, is the heart it had. Despicable Me 2, to me, feels like it's less of a subplot (it's heart-story, that is the romance of Gru and Wilde, and the fact that Agnes really wants a mommy)... I feel like it was just too intentional of, ""Well, let's make it have a heart,"" as opposed to the reveals, warmth and comfort of the first one of what it is for Gru to realize he has the moon, but really just wants the kids.

I don't know how the makers could've made it better, but I think they could have. HOWEVER, don't get me wrong, it's a cherished addition to my movie collection, and worth the watch. It'll keep you entertained, it does have a little bit of heart, it's jokes are good, but maybe it's just me, I still think it's lacking SOMETHING that the first one had.",1403827200,2,797,4.209150326797386

4928669,1,7799444371,"The first time I saw Despicable Me, I was very very impressed. Before that, I couldn't remember the last time I had enjoyed an original animated movie that much. It was heartfelt, it was funny, the minions were hilarious and the character development and story telling were top notch. My question: What the hell happened come Despicable Me 2? I found myself unable to wait for this film to end. I honestly think a sequel was produced to cash in on the popularity of the first film. One of my biggest issues was the Minions. Why were they so funny in the first movie? They appeared at random intervals to cause havoc, mess up a task or blurt out some random gibberish. They were funny and the movie didn't make the mistake of clobbering you over the head with them like some major movies have done with popular side kicks (Cars 2). I couldn't help but laugh every time I saw them. However, with Despicable Me 2, they got annoying about a half hour in. The movie pins you down and beats you over the head with them. Holy hell, they couldn't go five minutes without tossing a Minion joke in. The movie was so devoid of a plot and had no story at all that it seemed like every time the writers couldn't think of a way for the movie to advance due to lack of story, we got some Minions, And boy did we get Minions ALOT! My second point is the lack of a story. This movie literally had no plot. It was an hour and a half of familiar characters pandering about just being on screen for the sake of being on screen. Any time they tried to fill in some kind of moral, it came off sounding cheesy and so cliched with the whole ""Family Love"" situation I thought I was watching a Disney movie. Finally, the characters. I've established that the Minions just aren't as funny as they were in the first one (maybe due to having so much freakin screen time in this one). The characters didn't develop. At all. They stayed the same one dimensional people throughout the entire movie. Although, to Steve Carrell's credit, he does a good job bringing life to Gru. I know this is a kid's movie, but the ""villain"" was so goofy and annoying *Insert any generic overproduced hunk of animated trash currently airing on Nickelodeon here* I know the Minions are getting their own movie and I don't want to pre-judge but they need to do better if they want that to succeed. No plot with a Minions movie would surely be film suicide. I didn't despise this movie, but it left me feeling so unfulfilled and unsatisfied that this was the cliched, worn out, random mess of a long awaited sequel to a movie I held in such high standards.",1402358400,9,2604,4.371134020618556

I couldn't love it any more than I already do!  Gru is actually very lovable and has quite a heart.  In this second movie, he still has the girls as well as all of the minions.

The minions are what brought it home to be actually funny with their cuteness and it did not show the woman  relationship building with the kids either. The whole love sequence could have been left out. They did go overboard with the disbelief as well flying shark  into a volcano and the girl just lifting the door up instead of waiting for the plane to land.

4928934,4,7799444371,My kids loved the movie. Hope we didn't have to see the beach scene with a minion's bare bottom. Makes no sense to me as to why we have scenes like that in a kids movie. Even with PG rating. What value did that add to the story? What kind of messages are we sending to the young children's minds...that it's ok to go naked? I hope not.

We take her to see pretty much EVERY family-friendly movie that comes to the theaters, and I have to say, the Despicable Me series holds a special place in our hearts- not only is it wildly appealing to children, it's also very, very funny. And both films stand the test of repeated watching. I have to admit, I like the first ""Despicable Me"" better, but it's nice to have both of them in our library. I'm sure you've seen this, but if you haven't- go ahead and rent/buy it. It's worth the time. Very funny.",1397001600,4,604,4.401785714285714

4929047,5,7799444371,"The first copy of the movie I've received did not work--literally. It would not play and was a disappointment, given that I'd gotten it as a present for a child who then could not enjoy it (and living overseas, cannot just download the electronic version from Amazon). I can't blame Amazon for the manufacturing flaw, and they came through with sending another copy right away, which plays okay. The little girl ended up getting a copy from the local store overseas (exorbitant fee!!) from me, but I am still glad with the copy I have now, and which plays delightfully. Probably was a factory fluke.
The movie itself is absolutely hilarious. I love it better than the first Despicable Me, and I laugh every time I see it. I fell in love with in at the movies, where I took the kids to see it--and I don't know who enjoyed it more, the adults or the kids! :)

Don't expect a great story line or thought provoking moments, but do expect to be completely disarmed and have a good laugh.",1394755200,,339,4.451612903225806

4929231,1,7799444371,"Great movie, the kids love it.  Highly recommended.  Rating is due to having to pay up for UltraViolet and not really getting a digital copy.  Research the limitations of UV before you buy this bundle.",1394668800,,201,4.685714285714286
4929232,4,7799444371,"The hard part, I guess, is keeping Gru despicable while working as a good guy. They do a pretty good job of not killing the character and that holds the movie together. Especially as he dresses like a fairy for his adopted daughters birthday when the hired ones a no-show, or when he's got to get between his preteen daughter and her sleazy crush. Of course the kids love the minions, and they can be funny but the two songs at the end sung in about ten languages all strewn together for about 8 minutes grates at you so hard you might start plucking your own eyes out!

That said, this is an entertaining even-for-the-adults film for people who like Shrek and The Incredibles! The performances are excellent, the animation is solid and there are some real laughs and genuine emotion.",1394668800,,784,4.560283687943262

4929234,5,7799444371,My family loved the first Dispicable Me movie so much that we had to have Dispicable Me 2.  These movies are so well done and appropriate for families.,1394668800,,151,4.392857142857143
4929235,5,7799444371,"Just heartwarming enough, without being sappy. Love that I could rent this without having to go outside in the snow! Recommended for children and the young at heart. It's a cute movie, and the CGI is stunning.",1394668800,,209,4.675675675675675

4929238,4,7799444371,"Great humor, but there is an uncomfortableness about the minions who blindly do the bidding of someone with unmerited power.  There are really funny moments, and it seems like the perfect movie to love, but, as in the case of Curious George who never has to deal with consequences, or Disney delights that ignore the whole role of family as a support system for children, there is just an itch of discomfort.  Not willing to try to quantify or argue the point, I simply feel an internal caution about the film, and don't feel open to recommending it.",1394582400,,550,4.6020408163265305

So I purchased the CD of the movie's music, as well as the DVD movie.  I liked it but it was no ""Shrek"", or ""Nemo""...in other words, it isn't a cartoon movie that has as much humor for the adults watching it as for children.  But I liked it and most of the music.",1394582400,,398,4.064102564102564

4929477,5,7799444371,"Now I have seen many reviews saying this movie wasn't nearly as good as the original, and of course, sequels usually never are. But this movie came as close as possible in my eyes. Not only do we get to see our lovable protagonist again and his darling children, but we are introduced to a possible love interest who is cunning along with being funny. I feel that it didn't focus too much on the romance because we got to see a great deal of turmoil between Gru and his need to be good after becoming a father. Also, we can never forget the adorable and hilarious minions. Who, in my opinion, make these movies so great.

Sidenote: The blu ray quality of this movie is even superb. Not to mention the mini movies attached to this version of the movie. I won't spill any spoilers but they are worth watching because they are not only sweet, but will make you laugh.",1392854400,,864,4.333333333333333

4929590,3,7799444371,"The kid characters in this movie are fun and the contrast between Gru's tough appearance and his wonderful parenting skills is what makes this series a hit, in my opinion. Brought  in a love interest here, she was okay. The minions provided a physical comedy element, though other characters did alot of physical comedy too. A kid family film that adults probably wouldn't mind watching.",1392163200,,387,4.953846153846154

4929638,5,7799444371,"Despicable Me 2 is wonderful.  As a parent of two (10 & 3) there are a lot of kids or family friendly movies that play frequently at our house.  This movie (and Despicable Me) are two that I never grow tired of having on because not only are they good fun but they somehow manage to keep things fresh and entertaining even after you've seen them two dozen times.

This movie takes place not long after the first, Gru has given up his criminal endeavors and is focusing on raising his three daughters and crafting a ""delicious"" line of jams and jellies.  The tranquil life of parenthood proves elusive however as another villain has recently stolen a secret formula which can create mindless, indestructible super baddies.  Helping Gru, aside from his trusty minions (who are hilarious as ever) is Penny, a wonderful sidekick and potential love interest on the hunt through the local mall to find out who isn't really who they seem to be.

Thankfully, there is a lot going on in this picture that not only keeps kiddos entertained, but it also has some great material for parents.  I would classify this as super safe family entertainment.  There really isn't any themes or content that I grimace through and we, as a family, very much hope that this is a series that continues on (with the same cast of course).  The minions might need their own spin off movie, those little guys are hilarious!",1391990400,,1394,4.634146341463414

4929746,5,7799444371,"""Despicable Me 2"" picks up right where the first movie left off. Gru has given up his criminal ways and now spends his time trying to be a good father to his three girls Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Gru's simple life doesn't last very long though. He is sought out and recruited by the Anti-Villain League to find and stop the criminal who stole a serum that turns living things into invincible monsters. Gru sets out to do just this with the help of his new partner Lucy as well as his little, yellow minions.

""Despicable Me 2"" is just as funny and entertaining as the first movie. As with the first film, much of the movie's humor is provided by the minions and the crazy things that they do. One of their funniest scenes is when Gru starts a fire in his room and the minions, wearing firemen outfits, come to the rescue swinging an ax and destroying everything in their path. The hilarious Steve Carell returns to voice Gru and again does as awesome job. Lucy (voiced by Kristen Wiig) is a nice addition to the list of characters providing a love interest for Gru as well as a good amount of humor to the film. Out of the three girls, Agnes is the cutest and has the funniest personality. It is almost impossible not to laugh at some of the things that she does.

Although it's a good movie, it isn't perfect and does have its flaws. The plot is quite similar to the first. Gru sets out to foil the evil plans of a criminal mastermind. However, it is a children's movie so originality isn't exactly something the audience will worry too much about. The three girls don't play a very big part in the movie. It would have been nice if they had a bigger role. Also, the whole romance thing between Margo and El Macho's son seemed kind of pointless.

""Despicable Me 2"" is geared mostly towards children, but it can be enjoyed by teenagers and adults as well. If you liked the first movie then you should definitely give the second one a try. It is a great animated comedy that can be watched and enjoyed alone or with the whole family.",1391558400,,2031,4.353562005277045

4929759,4,7799444371,"While not my favorite animated movie of all time, I did enjoy the first ""Despicable Me"" movie.  It was fun seeing a story from a more villainous character's point of view, and the film was just flat-out funny and even adorable.  But I was wary upon learning that a sequel was in the works -- too often movie sequels just can't live up to their predecessors.  And when I learned that the second movie would feature a female lead and possible love interest for Gru, I was even more skeptical.  Did we need a forced romantic subplot, and does every hero need to be paired up anymore?

I'm happy to say that ""Despicable Me 2"" is just as good as the first film.  While not without its problems, it's still a fun and cute romp, and to my delight the female lead doesn't detract from the movie.

""Despicable Me 2"" picks up where the first movie left off -- Gru has mostly abandoned his villainous ways and is devoting himself to being a father to Margo, Edith, and Agnes, the three orphans he adopted in the first movie, as well as start a jelly-making company.  His plans get derailed when the Anti-Villain League tracks him down, and he finds himself a reluctant recruit for their cause to track down whoever stole a dangerous serum that can turn creatures into psychotic monsters.  Along the way Gru teams up with Lucy Wilde, a goofy and spirited AVL agent with her own slew of funky gadgets.  While the girls try to nudge the two of them together and a pushy neighbor tries to get Gru to date, nastier things are underfoot -- Gru's minions are disappearing, and a former supervillain named El Macho may be resurfacing...

The plot of this movie is a little choppy, and not as focused as the first film.  It tries to juggle multiple plots at once -- Gru and Lucy's developing relationship, the search for the missing serum, the missing minions, Margo falling for a boy, Dr. Nefario's retirement, etc.  It can make for a slightly confusing viewing experience, especially for young children.  But unlike the first film, which left several loose ends hanging, this one ties its multiple plots up fairly neatly at the end, which should satisfy older viewers.

The animation in this film is stylized and slick, not quite up to Pixar or Dreamwork's standards but still very fun to look at.  It doesn't settle for a generic bland look for its human characters, and isn't afraid to show its characters warts and all.  Characters get large noses, huge chins, and other features that tend to be exaggerated for comic effect but somehow work with the film's style.

My biggest worry about this film -- Lucy Wilde -- turned out to be unfounded.  Rather than being a brainless love interest or a stereotypical action girl, Lucy is her own character, and a good one to boot.  She can still kick butt and hold her own in a fight, but she's still something of a dork and has a goofy sense of humor.  After seeing so many ""strong action girls"" in movies who tend to all be the same generic ""stoic badass with a troubled past"" types, it's nice and refreshing to see one that actually has a personality beyond that.

The returning characters continue to be a delightful bunch as well.  Gru, despite being mostly reformed, is still something of a snarker, and keeps his death traps and tendency to be jerkish despite being the hero this time around.  Dr. Nefario longs for the good old days when they were wicked, but still proves to be a decent guy.  The girls remain cute with a bit of a cynical/ghoulish streak, and the minions are hilarious as always.  The new characters seem to be mostly stereotypes, sadly -- El Macho is especially embarrassing if you're Hispanic -- but Lucy's presence mostly makes up for this.

While not as brilliant as ""Frozen,"" ""Despicable Me 2"" is still a fun and adorable movie, great for all ages (though very young children might be frightened by a few scenes).  If you liked the original, you'll love this one.",1391558400,,3920,4.569384835479256

4929844,4,7799444371,It has the same great characters and though it can follow a predictable route they still through a few loops in there. For the fathers out there its also shows the diabolic side of you that really wanted to freeze ray the boy that broke your daughters heart first. And many other laughable moments.

It's a fanciful, fantastic search and discover, with Gru being abducted by Lucy from the girls' birthday party--where he masquerades as Princess Gruzinkerbell when the original doesn't show up.  As usual the minions steal the show...with their romantic love song at the end, and a short but amusing imitation of the Village People which I wish had been longer.

4929993,5,7799444371,"About the Movie:
 Sticky doesn't begin to describe Gru's new life: the ex-supervillain has given up his villainous ways and he and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) have settled into the legitimate business of making jellies and jams with the help of his army of minions. Parenting is no less sticky, and the fact that Gru will go to any length to ensure the happiness of his adopted girls Agnes, Edith, and Margo is evident by the elaborate birthday party he's throwing for Agnes that includes a live unicorn and a princess named Gruzinkerbell. Anti-Villain League operative Lucy Wild (Kristen Wiig) kidnaps Gru after the party, using an arsenal of spy gadgetry that would make James Bond jealous, and the agency solicits his help in apprehending a criminal who's made an entire secret lab disappear from the Arctic Circle and stolen a dangerous transmutation formula.

 The lure of excitement tempts Gru, and he and Lucy set up an undercover operation in a bakery in Paradise Mall, the minions start cranking out cupcakes, and Gru and Lucy begin investigating their fellow business owners. Meanwhile, Agnes pines for a mother, Margo finds her first boyfriend, Dr. Nefario takes a more exciting job, a slew of minions go missing, and Gru staunchly refuses to enter the dating scene. Little does Gru know that his whole life is about to change once again. The minions and their antics are quite funny in this second film, and, for the 10-and-under crowd, they completely steal the show.

My Review:
 Ever since the minion craze has hit the digital air waves my children have been hooked. And the second movie in the series is just as great as the first if not better. My favorite part was the Agnes' birthday party scene when the fairy princess didn't show up to entertain the party guests. Then what Gru does next was so incredibly sweet and Agnes' response to it was priceless. This movie is sure to make you laugh and shed a tear or two.

Gru is suddenly thrust back out into the work force, his former career that he had recently left to raise his precious daughters. The reason being is that El Macho,the evil genius behind the newest rush to take over the world is on the loose and has some dirty tricks up his sleeve. So the Anti-Villain League recruit Gru to capture this guy and save the world. The pull of trying to keep the world safe, a world that also holds his precious daughters makes it very hard for Gru not to want to take care of this evil villain. What is this Dad going to do to protect them?

4930030,4,7799444371,"Despicable Me 2 provides us with the further adventures of Gru, the arch villain who, at the end of the first film, had given up his evil ways to become a doting dad and a respectable business man.  However, because he has insider knowledge on how evildoers work, hes been tapped by a top-secret spy organization to go undercover  and help save the world from bad guys who are not quite as reformed as he is. Gru teams up with Lucy Wilde, an attractive agent who also becomes a love interest, to find out who absconded with an entire research laboratory in the Arctic with the use of a giant magnet.

While its true that Gru, as a character, is probably more interesting and fun when hes plotting crimes rather than fighting them, Despicable Me 2 is still an entertaining and colorful diversion for audiences of all ages. Steve Carell, Kristin Wiig, Benjamin Bratt, Russell Brand, Steve Coogan and Ken Jeong are some of the better-known actors who provide the voice work for the film.",1390262400,,984,4.611428571428571

Subtle humor. As a result we were now way going to miss part 2.  Granddad took the two girls to a Saturday matinee and enjoyed this immensely. If you have ever enjoyed Steve Carell, you will also appreciate his work in both films. He should have been awarded (maybe he was?) for his effort. A fun time.

4930061,5,7799444371,"This is one of those rare occasions when a sequel is as good as - or BETTER THAN - the original installment (which was fantastic as well).

This is the sequel to Despicable Me and continues the story of Gru and his girls.  Like any good single-dad story, this one is ripe for romance, Gru-style.  This story introduces Lucy (voiced by Kristin Wiig) who works for the agency in charge of catching villains.  Gru, being retired, initially resists getting involved (he's developing a line of jams and jellies, so he's busy).  No surprise that he joins up with Lucy to catch a villain, comes across a long lost rival villain and antics ensue to catch the guy.

Along the way Lucy falls for Gru.  Yadda yadda, the girls have a mommy :)

The Minions are featured in this film even more than the first and they don't fail to delight.  I hear there's a Minion centered film due out in a few years.  I hope so, those guys are HILARIOUS.

As with the first movie, parents who are averse to a little mild potty humor might want to skip it.  I have a 7 & 3 year old who love this movie.",1390176000,,1074,4.262376237623762

He'd been unable to come home for the holidays since 2001, so Christmas 2013 was a special event as he was able to visit us in person and we ordered this movie and a few others he had requested as well. Amazon makes shopping easy whether its for delivered items, or gift cards which are available immediately (great for those shoppers who procrastinate until the last minute). He loved the movies...Thank you Amazon!",1389830400,,557,4.524752475247524

4930191,4,7799444371,"Funnier than the first one IMO, it still lacked a little in some places. Some of the humor might have been a bit too much for smaller children but it was great for older ones. All in all a good movie that wouldn't be nearly as funny if it weren't for the minions.",1389830400,,263,3.981132075471698

4930197,4,7799444371,"Many professional reviewers have said that this is not as good as the first.  I found that it was as clever as the first with some great new twists that made it really enjoyable as an adult.  Our kids love it and watch it at least twice a week.  The minions really made the movie this time, adding some much needed comic relief, as the kids aren't as concerned with the love story as much as their goofy side.

Our younger 2 kids can get scared easily with some of the villain's in a lot of the Barbie and Disney movies which makes them unwatchable until they reach a certain age.  This movie is not like that.  The villain's and even the purple minions are not so scary that they are too scared to watch.

Great voice casting, great action, great animation, a few spots where it was easy to guess what was coming next, otherwise 5 stars, but definitely worth a rent or buy in our case.",1389830400,,886,4.238095238095238

The treatment was light and fun, as was the plot, but the underlying story had depth.  In Despicable 2, the lightness and fun give way to juvenile silliness.  Characters you could believe in in the first version are jammed into a wandering, who-cares plot.  Even the minions lost their appeal.  A good movie for little kids, I'm sure, but give it a pass if you're over age 12.",1389484800,3,497,4.52808988764045

My son (3.5 years old) asks to watch the new yellow guy movie cause he enjoys it so much.

4930440,4,7799444371,"I have been working with 3D graphics so I have a pretty good idea of the work involved in making a feature animation like this.  These people have done an excellent job of putting it all together, creating a fun and enjoyable movie the whole family can enjoy together.

I've been told by a friend that 3D capable TVs and blu-ray 3Ds aren't selling well which to me is sad.  The quality of in home 3D picture is, at least in my viewing experience, superior to the experience of watching the same movie in a theater where it is being presented in 3D.  So if you don't own a 3D capable TV, you don't know what you are missing.  These days, the price of 3D capable TVs isn't that much more than 2D TVs so if you are in the market for a new TV, I recommend supporting the 3D industry, otherwise it will fade away.",1389398400,,808,4.153846153846154

The movies is really sweet, funny, exciting and smart. I can't help thinking the movie-makers -- from script writers to animators to directors -- had as much or even more fun than the audiences watching it.

My nagging fears that it wouldn't hold a candle to the first one were unfounded, and I love it as well.  All of the charm, sweetness, nastiness and humor is in this sequel, even surpassing the first one in some cases.

I didn't watch the first installment (my kids did), but this movie still made sense because the natures of the main characters were apparent early on.  It is a fun, silly comedy that is good family-fare, especially if you like spoofing of spy techniques and hardware.

When we were streaming the movie we did encounter plenty of pauses:  Amazon fully refunded me the rental amount without my even asking for it.

We liked the 1st one but this one is even better, much better. It is colorful and funny all the way through. Not a boring moment during the whole movie. Be sure to watch the credits because there are funny parts shown in them too. We usually sit and what the credits to all the animated films because most of them have funny scenes shown while the credits are being shown. To many people walk out as soon as the credits start and miss seeing them. The reason we bought this is so we can see it over and over and have it on hand for when grand children come to visit.

As an adult, I will say that I loved the original Despicable Me, it was great fun with a good story, good animation, something for kids and adults and good humor.  Despicable Me 2 continues that with another story that both adults and kids will find great fun.  The story is fun and entertaining and had me laughing at times even with its juvenile fart gun humor.  DM2 even has a nice heart warming story mixed in just like they did with the original.  The minions are as fun as ever and almost take over the whole movie again...they are destined to be in their own big screen story.

Fun, good story, and enjoyable the whole way through.  A recommended watch for kids or kids at heart.",1389139200,,847,4.425806451612903

4930620,3,7799444371,Poor script structure. The villain was introduced late in the story - no one to hate. The girls were put on the sidelines and not developed any further than the first story - no one to love. The hero was a predictable nice guy - no one to save.,1389139200,,244,4.0

4930625,5,7799444371,"""Despicable Me 2"" Is by far the funniest movie I have ever seen! In this movie, these are the best things: Gru is much nicer, the girls now know that he will care for them and is no longer evil. There are new villains, sorry, I can't tell you who (But you'll find out in the movie.) There are new locations: the mall, minion beach, and the A.V.L. (Anti Villain League) secret base. There are new weapons: jelly blasters, ""lipstick taser!"" and jars of evil, purple potion that turns minions into evil, purple minions. Also, the minions are even funnier than they used to be: they run all over the place in minion beach, sing lots of songs, including Y.M.C.A., and, well, just do what minions do best: make people laugh! Finally, Gru has a great new partner: A woman named Lucy, she is funny because she talks funny sometimes,and is a little bit clumsy (she may also have a relationship with Gru). The animation is as good as the movie itself! Definitely TWICE as good as I thought it would be!! You should definitely see this movie! The best part is, you can get it on Amazon Instant Video for only a few dollars! Great movie! 'Cano out!",1389139200,,1136,4.440191387559809

This was actually far better than the original and laugh out loud funny almost all the way through. The 3D (which was the version I watched) was amazing even as far as animated 3D goes.

The minions have a bigger role in this one and are cuter than ever, even when they turn evil. Gru is better as a character struggling between his now good and former evil personalities. The girls and their relationships are more developed, and Agnes is even more adorable, especially when eagerly awaiting the fairy princess.

You can't go wrong with this one. I'm really, really hoping now for a second sequel.",1389052800,,714,4.5703125

4930695,4,7799444371,"My kids (3, 9, and 10) all love this movie.  They think the minions are hilarious and adore the characters.  It lost a star from me because the older girl is in my opinion too young for dating and as this was pretty important to the storyline I felt that made it not as good for me and my family.  The rest of the story was however very good and enjoyable.  My kids have watched it several times since we purchased it and seem to enjoy it as much each time.",1389052800,,457,3.989010989010989

4930699,5,7799444371,The bad guy (should I say villian?) in this movie is MUCH better than the first.  My three year old and I can't get enough of this flick.  The minions are great! 5 stars!!,1388966400,,171,4.0
4930700,4,7799444371,"Not quite as good as the first film, but close enough.  They lost me with all the mundane dating woes.  They should have concentrated on the investigation of the missing mini minions and the pursuit of an evil unknown villain who was up to no good.  Instead, they went the ordinary route and wasted too much time on budding puppy-love issues.  I don't blame Dr. Nefario for losing patience with Gru and his jams and jellies.  That's definitely not a proper pursuit for a one-time arch villain.

Thank goodness they're going to give the multiple mini minions a movie of their own.  Can't wait.",1388966400,,592,4.634615384615385

4930704,5,7799444371,A great sequel. My daughter loves the minions and can't wait to see their own movie when it comes out and keeps asking me if they are going to make a Despicable Me 3. Very good movie and Steve Carrel does a great job again as the voice of Gru,1388966400,,242,3.86

4930709,4,7799444371,Despicable Me 2 is quite possibly even better than the first movie. It's a must have for our movies collection.,1388966400,,111,4.6

4930715,5,7799444371,"Yet another great family movie, with plenty of humor for adults, too.  A few parts were ""scary,"" according to my four year old, but they weren't so over the top that I would discourage showing this to children his age.  Just like the original, we loved it!",1388966400,,256,4.425531914893617
4930716,5,7799444371,"A squeal that did not disappoint. Had all the great aspects from the first movie but was different enough to make a unique story. The creators are brilliant!! Lots of great creative scenes. If you liked the first, you will like this movie.",1388966400,,239,4.5813953488372094

4930720,4,7799444371,"If you have to have a sequel to DM 1 then certainly this qualifies. The little guys are still a hoot and the kids are as ""adorable"" as the little kindergartener in the telephone commercial.

4930723,5,7799444371,... especially since our laptops have Blu-Ray and we only have a DVD player at the television.  You will laugh!  Funny movie!  I actually bought it for my dad for Christmas.,1388966400,,173,4.516129032258065

4930725,5,7799444371,Full of funny gags similar to the first movie.  Kids watch it over and over!  Very family friendly with Mr. Gru showing his fatherly side and love for his girls.  Lots of minons!!  This movie is worth purchasing!,1388966400,,212,4.5
4930726,5,7799444371,More minnions in this one cause we can't get enough. One of those great movies that you can watch more than once and see things you missed in the first viewing...,1388966400,,162,4.258064516129032

4930729,3,7799444371,"Steve Carrell's voice over is good and the little minions are funny as can be, but plot is pretty weak and predictable. Still its a kid's movie so you can't complain. Little ones should be entertained by this movie. Love Minions.",1388966400,,229,4.609756097560975
4930730,5,7799444371,"Loved it. It seemed to be more for the parent then the kids. Our family, 2 parents 1 toddler, really enjoyed it.",1388966400,,112,4.136363636363637
4930731,4,7799444371,Funny and good for kids and adults. Had my wife crying it was so funny. Would watch this movie again.,1388966400,,101,4.1

4930733,5,7799444371,"I enjoyed the 1st Despicable me, and I feel this one was at least as good.  The minions were really emphasized during this movie, which gave it an originality from the 1st.  Overall very funny and enjoyable.",1388966400,,207,4.5675675675675675
4930734,5,7799444371,My kids adore Grue and the minions! Laughs nonstop had by all of us in our family! A must see!,1388966400,,94,3.75
4930735,5,7799444371,"There's just something about Gru, his girls and his hilarious Minions that appeals to everyone.

The whole family loved the first movie and we also loved the 2nd one. The first one introduced the world to Gru, the evil genius, and the adorable girls who melted his heart. In the second, we see that Gru has gone ""legit"" attempting to produce jams and jellies with his evil scientist, Dr. Nefario, and the irrepressible Minions.

Throughout the movie, we see the typical awkward Steve Carell love story develop (no one does awkward love stories better than Carell) as Gru helps identify and stop a truly ""evil"" villain.

The comedy is occasionally childish (Silas Ramsbottom...giggle, giggle) but is constant, you must view several times to catch all the background jokes, pratfalls and sight gags. Especially on the part of the Minions and Kyle the dog.

Dr. Nefario leaving Gru because he's not ""evil enough"" is an interesting twist but works out well in the end.

Overall, this movie is all about family, love, fitting in and always doing the right thing. All kids movies should have a similar message.",1388966400,,1104,4.882352941176471
4930736,5,7799444371,This is just as good as the first movie. It is hard to find an animated movie that is fun for the whole family to watch but this fits the bill.,1388966400,,143,3.6451612903225805
4930737,5,7799444371,Hilarious!  Bought it after we saw it on Amazon Prime! The minions made the show with all their stunts. Loved it.,1388966400,,113,4.380952380952381

4930741,4,7799444371,"While not quite as good as the first movie, this is still a pretty safe bet for fun family viewing. (There are some strange scenes where a neighbor lady is trying to set Gru up on a blind date, and then the blind date itself is pretty awful.)  My kids ranging from 5 to 17 all enjoyed it.",1388880000,,288,3.9655172413793105

4930743,5,7799444371,This is a great character movie which my grand children just love.  They have the Minion plush dolls as well.  The price was also very good compared to other stores.,1388880000,,165,4.466666666666667
4930744,5,7799444371,Did not disappoint. Every character was their lovable selves and the new cast was delightfully eccentric. A good addition for the family collection.,1388880000,,148,5.478260869565218

4930750,3,7799444371,"This ""Despicable Me"" is NOT as good as the first one.  I wanted to see the ""father-daughter"" bonding, and ""too cute"" dialogue.  Nothing interesting happened.  I suppose people wrote to the producers and complained about a weird, strange, unmarried man adopting three young girls for the purpose of stealing a ""ray-gun,"" so they decided to dump an uninteresting wife on him.  Now that the dad is married, that special father-daughter bonding will forever be lost.  I was so distracted by its dullness that I eventually just fell asleep.  I assume children will find it entertaining, maybe, maybe not.  Glad, I saw someone elses copy before I paid for my own.",1388880000,,657,4.918181818181818

Yeah, they have the animation nailed but clearly they didn't want to push any boundaries with character growth or interesting themes.

4930801,4,7799444371,"Fun, silly and family-friendly. Fans of the first Despicable Me film won't be disappointed, as the sequel has plenty of the zaniness and heart that made the first so appealing. Steve Carrell's Gru is a little softer around the edges, but still a quirky outsider with big aspirations. At the beginning of the film we find him and the minions embracing the chaos of family life, but dissatisfied with his efforts to convert his criminal enterprise into a jams-and-jellies business. Kristin Wiig is a nice addition as a kooky agent who tries to recruit Gru to join the Anti Villain League. And the minions, of course, steal every scene they're in.

Humor is silly and accessible to younger watchers, but there's plenty to keep older viewers entertained as well. The animation is delightful and the story engaging -- although less thoroughly developed than the first. There are a few storylines that never go anywhere and a few plot points that feel undercooked, but nothing that really derails the plot, and younger viewers probably won't even notice.

A few plot developments might be a little too scary for the youngest watchers (a minion kidnapping orchestrated by a sinister ice-cream truck, and a serum that turns creatures hyper-violent), but ultimately this is a fun, well drawn, entertaining film with wide appeal.",1388793600,,1319,5.018264840182648

My 9 year old daughter--who doesn't often like to go see movies in the theater--went twice to see it in the theater and then wanted the DVD. Got the Blu Ray/DVD/Digital Copy combo at Target, and it included not only an UltraViolet copy for watching on my Vudu/Flixster/M-Go logins, it included a promo code for the Amazon HD version as well!

4930847,2,7799444371,"That's all I can say about this movie and still be nice. It's PG, but I could find very little content actually appropriate for children. The story line was extremely lame. If it had actual comedy in it, it may have helped, but there was very little comedy. The only saving grace of Despicable Me is the Minions, and they were nearly nonexistent in this movie. It was entirely about Gru finding a girlfriend and trying to keep his eldest adopted daughter from finding a boyfriend. Whoever thought this was a ""comedy blockbuster"" should get out of the critiquing business. Even my eleven-year-old and nine-year-old spent a majority of the movie going ""Oh, come on, really?"" ""That was dumb"", ""When is it going to get funny?"" I heard a couple of giggles when the Minions made an appearance, but for the most part, there was nothing but disappointment. Definitely not worth the $5 rental fee.",1388707200,,888,4.735483870967742

While DM2 was good and continues on the same funny line as the first it seemed more like string of bit gags strung together than a story.

I love the part where two of the minions are trying to save Gru and they have some road / car / chicken antics that you just will have to see for yourself!  I'm sitting here smiling about it now.  Wish I had bought the movie instead of renting it.  I can't get enough of the minions.  Actually some of the other characters in this one were really fun to watch also.

My four boys (ages 17, 14, 11 and 9), my husband and I all sat down to watch together.  I really liked the plot, and I loved the further development of the characters from the first movie.  There were many funny lines and sight gags which entertained all of us.  Over all, I think I would rather watch this sequel again than the first movie.

Concerning the 3D, it looked really great.  I enjoyed the extra dimension (pun intended) of fun it added to the movie, watching things flying out at us. It also made the characters seem more ""real.""  Even watching the home screen playing over and over in 3D was quite entertaining.",1388534400,,784,4.402777777777778

4931003,5,7799444371,"Despicable Me 2 is really a great movie - it's cute, uplifting, and really funny.  The story focuses on Gru's (the main character who is voiced by Steve Carrell) attempt to locate a villain who is using a dangerous compound called PX-40 to transform good into evil.  Along the way, we learn a lot about Gru's daughters (Agnes, Edith and Margo), Dr. Nefario, Agent Lucy from the AVL, and Silas Ramsbottom, who is part of the hysterical 'bottom' scene.

But the stars of the show, far and away, are the minions.  They are simply hysterical in every way, from their language to their actions to how they fit into the story.  This film makes you want to see a story just about the minions!!  I have seen the movie about 5 times so far (my daughters love it) and each time I find something the minions say or do which I didn't notice before.

This isn't a movie just for kids, so don't avoid it for that reason.  A lot of the humor is subtle but appropriate for adults.  And the minions, while seeming to be characters designed for kids, are far from that.

Of all the sequels I've seen, this is one of those that outperforms the original - by a long shot!  So if you haven't seen it, take the time to enjoy this hilarious movie!! You won't be sorry!",1388534400,,1245,4.323275862068965

This is a wonderful movie.  When this movie came out in the theaters, I was concerned about the transition of Gru from a villain and into another role.  I didn't see it in the theaters, so this purchase was something that had to be done.

The plot is fun, the minions still make me laugh (and most importantly, remind me that even as an adult in my 40s, sometimes being goofy and having fun is what's important), and the best part of all:  My daughter LOVES this as much as the first Despicable Me.",1388448000,,655,4.158730158730159

4931037,3,7799444371,"It's still cute and funny, but...

The plot was totally predictable, there is less character development than there should have been, and it was just not as good or funny as the first one.",1388448000,,188,4.529411764705882

The kids are as darling as ever, the minions are more plentiful and fun than before, the cast of major characters doubles (at the least), and Groo really comes into his own in the role of hero rather than villain. The animation is top-notch, the voice acting is perfect, and the sound effects are also great. I give this movie my highest possible recommendation!",1388448000,,496,4.6477272727272725
4931041,5,7799444371,Saw this movie in the theater with my 4 years old son. Had to buy it for him so we could watch it again and again. Purchased it before it was released. Amazon made sure I got the lowest price.,1388448000,,192,3.825
4931042,4,7799444371,"My husband and I enjoy this movie right along with our children (age 4yrs and age 20 months). The storyline is cute, but I think what makes it the most fun is that we already love most of the main characters because we met them in Despicable Me. It is also a lot of fun to watch the kids interact with the movie. Both of my children LOVE the soundtrack to this movie.
Gramma bought this movie for the kids from Walmart. We put the blu-ray in the PS3 to watch it and were highly disappointed to find out that the blu-ray didn't work. We switched it out with the DVD and enjoyed the movie. Two days later I took back the set and they replaced the movie for us. Came home to find that they blu-ray started just fine; however the next day we had the same problem as we did with the first blu-ray. I did some research online to see if anyone else was having this issue. Three days later people had started posting about the problem. Apparently, there are new blu-ray discs that have an issue being read in the PS3 (Fast & Furious 6 being another one). Someone suggested a work around to the problem so we tried it and it worked: When you put your blu-ray in and start it, you need to tell it no when it asks if you want to connect to the internet. (If your system is already set-up to auto-confirm turning on the internet you will need to go to the blu-ray internet settings on your PS3 and change it so you have to verify it, then each time you watch a blu-ray disk you will have the option to disable the internet or not). I really hope that this is helpful to someone else since it was highly frustrating for us to not be able to play our movie.",1388448000,,1643,4.121495327102804

Everyone loved the minions although the purple minions scared my 5 year old son a little bit the first time he saw them.  The second time around it didn't bother him.

And if you like the Minions (and who doesn't) you'll see a lot more of them in this movie because they play a more central role in the plot. Line many funny animated movies like this one you will want to watch it at least twice to catch all the little extra stuff going on in the backgraound, which is hilarious in itself.",1388275200,,380,4.08

4931145,5,7799444371,"I was hesitant to see this film because I am of the belief that no sequel can be as good as the original so it was just recently, at the begging of my 12 year old, that we rented and watched this movie. I loved it!
It was (to me) better then the first. It moved quicker and more smoothly then the first movie and had better characters.
Highly recommend this one and I will be buying it.",1388275200,,386,3.9615384615384617

4931154,3,7799444371,"So enjoyed the original movie for the way our fiendish villain was turned 360 for the love of three orphan girls.
Had hoped for some of the same warmth here but it was sadly lacking save for a very short goodnight scene.
Also came for the minions and they definitely were in full display but  just didn't see the entire movie resting on their tiny shoulders yet they were a hoot, a French hoot too boot!
Main gripe: in the preview during the abduction scene when the minions go outside after putting the girls to bed and are abducted...the preview had the music from Halloween and it was perfect, I was even looking forward to it but zap the scene comes with different music so it kinda lost its charm for me.
End result, fun active movie that entertains but don't look for the sweet sentimentally of the original.",1388275200,,814,4.4630872483221475

How do they talk like they do and yet you still get a sense that you understand them?? Very clever!  I love the story and the values of family and caring about one another that both Despicable Me movies present.  To me, it's the ideal kids' movie with all the qualities to allow people of all ages to enjoy it.  I just had to buy this movie so I could watch it again!!",1388275200,,540,4.095238095238095

Add to this, a colorful new villain, El macho, a love interest between Gru and Lucy, an agent from AVL (Anti-Villains League) and some hilarious secondary characters and you have a laugh fest that will appeal to both children and adults.

That wasn't the case with the first movie or any other ""new"" movie I have purchased.

I'm not sure why, but I thought that it was more on the lines of Shrek with regard to what my family considers inappropriate humor.  When this one was about to be released, my friends kept talking about it and getting so excited, so I decided to watch the first one.  Slap me in the face...I LOVED IT!!  We sat down as a family and watched it the next night and they all loved it, too.  As soon as Despicable Me 2 came out, I surprised my children with an afternoon stop at a local theater to see it.

Agent Wilde is a great character, and even though she's the obvious love interest and succumbs to damsel-in-distress mode in the end, I felt that the good parts of the movie made up for this on balance.

My three-year-old really liked the movie, but she found some of the parts in the ending pretty scary.",1388016000,,526,4.717391304347826

4931258,5,7799444371,"Usually sequels are a poor attempt at squeezing money out of a franchise and characters, with Despicable Me 2 I am already awaiting number 3.

This movie was funny, cute and engaging throughout.  If you liked first then you will love the second.  If you never saw the first or did not like it, then give number 2 a try, won't be disappointed.

The Minions get more play time and they make the movie, each one has a personality and humor of their own.

Steve Carrell and Kristen Wigg are amazing, Benjamin Bratt astounded me as El Macho!

We bought this movie from Amazon Instant Video and the family all watch it, either on the Kindles or Roku.  Well worth the money.

I enjoyed the first Despicable Me from what I recall, but this #2 made a huge impression and was such a FUN experience right from the first moment.  I don't recall laughing my way through a movie very often as I did with this.  The minutely detailed  visual effects and sounds are equally amazing.  I am a language ""nut"" and got a kick out of recognizing many of the sounds within the minions' jabbering (which you don't need to understand at all, because their emotions and body language tell all, anyway).  We especially enjoyed the extra features on the bonus disk. What a talented and hard-working group of people who envisioned and assembled this film.

Technically to me, takes it down a bit....

BUT, if you're here for fun, entertainment, excessive cartoon violence and just sheer batsh*t crazy animation, this is the movie for you.

Not necessary to view number 1 to enjoy this one, but why deprive yourself, it's a great movie as well.

Violence is cartoony and in general this should be safe for family viewing.

4931340,4,7799444371,"We enjoyed the first movie, especially as it was unique in its take on the villain. This sequel holds up better than typical sequels of other films, thanks to crisp animation and good voice acting. But the story was fairly predictable, even though I still wanted to see how it all turned out. There were some heart-filled moments, and the minions always add comic relief when its needed. Overall, if you liked the first movie, the second one shouldn't disappoint.

The extra short-films (three of them) are definitely short, but fun. It's nice they they gave these three new directors their chance to create a short using cherished characters from the movies. All three are fun, if not predictable, but you just can't turn away when minions are doing their simple things.

We only watched the blu-ray disc and it was sonically fantastic in surround. The picture, as expected, was practically perfect. The Ultraviolet streaming version was certainly watchable on VUDU, but it gets ugly quick if your Internet connection isn't fast enough to watch in HDX (their highest quality). Surround sound on the streaming version isn't as good as the blu-ray sound, but plenty good for those who aren't audiophiles.",1387411200,,1203,4.980099502487562

He then gets recruited by a woman (bow chica wow wow...) to catch a bad guy!  The story is cute and my kids (6, 5, and 2) all loved it.  The minions played a bigger part in this one I feel than the last and really they do make the movie!  We have watched this movie more times than I'd like to count and I do hope they make a third movie as we cannot get enough of those minions and now its interesting to see where Gru's relationship will go with the new woman in his life.

I received this DVD to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.",1387238400,,709,3.8551724137931034
4931380,1,7799444371,I took my kiddos 4yr and 3yr to see this when it came out. I'm such a disney snob so anything non disney I cringe. This movie validated why. I never saw the first installment of this film so I had no idea what to expect. The movie was so boring. The whole theatre did not laugh not one time where as when we went to see Monsters University weeks prior the whole theatre was in chuckles. At one point I was laughing so hard I started crying. I'm giving this to my now 5 year old for christmas because he likes the minions who were pretty pointless in the film. I have no idea what the hoopla is about this movie but I wish someone would explain why this is such a likable film because clearly I don't get it.,1387238400,4,707,4.0212765957446805

4931392,5,7799444371,"This was a great sequel to the first installment.
It was a little predictable and some jokes were familiar but a fun ride throughout.
There's more adult humor (not obscene) than some might expect so most adults will enjoy it too.
There were a few plot holes but I was able to ignore them and still enjoy the movie.
I prefer the original (who ever doesn't) but this is a must have for fans.
More minion hijinks and more laughs.

The bonus cartoons are short but very enjoyable, well at least 2 of the 3.
There are also other featurettes and behind the scenes shorts.

The 3D Blu-ray disc was great and had my family ooo-ing and ahhh-ing.
The picture was clear and the even action scenes were not nausea inducing.
I highly recommend this movie for testing out a new 3D TV or 3D Blu-ray player.

The neat lenticular slipcover appears to animate the party favor blower horn thing.
I love lenticular slipcovers and wish all 3D Blu-rays would include them.
When you pay so much for the entire set, every bonus is a plus.",1387238400,,1014,4.440860215053763

4931396,5,7799444371,"It is rare event when a sequel matches the original.  This movie does so very well.  It picks up the story of Gru, his three adopted girls, Dr Nefario, and the many minions who serve Gru in various capacities.

Gru is called on by the Anti-Villain League to stop a master villain who has stolen the PX-41 formula which can turn a normal, harmless living thing into a purple monster.

Gru teams up with the lovely Agent Wilde to fight El Macho, the super macho villain and Mexican restaurant owner at the mall.  Along the way the movie explores dating and its pitfalls.

The movie is filled with gags, puns, witty observations, and irony hurled at the audience at a break-neck fully entertaining pace.  There are jokes for the parents and jokes for the kids.

I honestly think people make the mistake of looking far too deep and expecting too much. It was a fun film made for mixed audiences and family friendly.

4931415,5,7799444371,This movie was funnier than the first one and the minions definitely make it work.  They are like an animated version of The Three Stooges - they really don't have to say anything and most of the time it's their actions that make you laugh.  I guess small children should be watched as there are some things the minions do that you may not want your kids doing (like hitting each other).  The three girls play a much bigger part this time around.,1387152000,,446,4.349397590361446

4931418,5,7799444371,"Some of us are blessed to know real minions, and they need the jolly reinforcement of seeing their brethren gathered en-mass in this film! The details of the art and film are overwhelmingly amazing, from the curly hairs on creature-dog Kyle's chin, to the underwater and jam sequences, the colors are delicious! There is even a love story here, quite delightfully done, along with mocking hideous, superficial puffed-up fake fish lips too prevalent in the plastic world today, anti-bullying, plus, pro-baldness, as there's nothin' wrong with less hair! And thank goodness for Minionese, we can't get enough of the little yellow guys. Good-hearted Gru and his girls Agnes, Edith, and Margo are a lovely family, and Anti-Villain League operative Lucy Wild is a treat. Only missed the Eminem song ""Without Me"" which we enjoyed in the previews. Pollito is a great touch - having been attacked by evil chickens, I know the truth. And you haven't lived until you see the minions bouncing around to Mungo Jerry's ""In the Summertime,"" or the Village People's ""YMCA!"" We can't wait till ""Despicable Me 3""!

The girls have grown but remain adorable. The young love was very well done. The little minions singing the wedding song in their language ruined a beautiful moment. I had to play it back with closed captioning to find what language. You miss completely that they are saying underwear instead of I swear.  But I just love the little guys anyway.

I'm always excited to receive anything I buy online and I always know that with Amazon, my purchases will always get to me before the arrival date they give. I've only ran into one issue and that was when one of the Kindle Fires I ordered did not make it to my door...or it did but was stolen. The tracking and delivery service stated that it was delivered, but I never saw it. I was freaked out like I had just thrown my money away, but one call to Amazon and they disabled the device so whoever stole it could not use it and they shipped another one to me right away. Amazon is TRULY the best shopping and online shopping experience and company that I've ever dealt with.

The same can be said for my opinion of this movie,  I found it very delightful and entertaining.  I felt it to be just as good as the first, maybe even a little more so.  The "" Little Guys"" were the best.  I found when there is a  scene with a lot of them in it, watching the ones in the back ground can be hilarious.  You can see them doing all sorts of things sometimes.  Next time you watch one of these movies, keep an eye on the background.",1386892800,,606,3.861788617886179

4931499,5,7799444371,"I bought the BD/DVD combo that also came with the digital copy along with it. Normally I am into making my own digital copies, but this particular one includes a voucher that gives you two versions of the digital copy. Because of the devices I use, I went for the UV copy, made available via the Flixster app (available on iOS and Android/Kindle Fire), and chose the Amazon Instant Video voucher option so I can now watch this on any BD, DVD, Wii, iOS, or Android device (incl. Kindle Fire). There was an iTunes option there but I wasn't sure if iTunes is a roach motel for video content and I wanted the ability to stream to the Wii anyway, which Amazon did all the heavy lifting for me by adding their instant video channel to the Wii Shop Channel.

Oh yeah, the movie was great, too. The kids roared with laughter and adults got a kick out of it too. Great story line; kudos to the whole project team that pulled this off (though it doesn't mean a whole lot coming from me).",1386806400,2,977,4.309782608695652

The minions are as good as ever, the orphans are as cute as ever, the romantic interest is devious and fun... Gru's competition in this movie is boring, there is no one-up man ship, no challenge to be the best... no competition. Gru's only competition is fighting off the affection of his romantic interest.

In all honesty, I didn't really think it was a movie my kids would enjoy for some reason. It just looked so different from the movies they usually watch and enjoy. Boy was I wrong!

My kids thought this was the funniest movie ever and I actually enjoyed it as well. I was pleasantly surprised and entertained by the humor. My kids and I all laughed throughout the movie. I like that theres adult and childrens humor so the parents watching the kids movie are entertained as well.

The characters are all so unique and endearing in their own right. There really is no one else I can compare them to which makes them truly special. Sometimes I feel like Im watching the same characters over and over in a different outfit with a slightly different voice. I cant say that about this movie!

Even though we didn't watch the first movie, I didn't feel lost watching this one but it did make me want to go back and see some of the history behind it and find out if it was just as entertaining!

4931579,4,7799444371,"That 2010s Despicable Me turned out to be an enormous hit is a bit of a surprise. Perfectly pleasant but also unremarkable, the feature scratched a certain audience itch at the time, striking a distinct cartoon blow while introducing the world to the hyperactive comedy antics of the minions -- those miniature yellow slapstick machines that eventually made Universal Pictures a mint in merchandise sales. Well, the minions are back, along with Gru and his adoptive children, with Despicable Me 2 perfectly content to replicate humor and spectacle for its adoring audience. However, with the lead character now playing for the good guys, certain changes have been made to the freshly-minted franchise, a few ideas that keep this sequel entertaining but never remarkable.

Now a domesticated man living with his three daughters, Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher), former supervillian Gru (Steve Carell) is content to be a dad, organizing birthday parties and perfecting a line of jellies and jams with help from his loyal minions and Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand). When a secret serum containing the power to make monsters out of anyone is stolen from a lab, the Anti-Villain League requests Grus help with retrieval, paring up the hopelessly single man with Lucy (Kristen Wiig), a flighty but fierce agent. Sent undercover into a mall to spy on dubious shopkeepers who might be hiding the serum, Gru and Lucy bond over their shared love of gadgets and interest in the evildoing of others. Their top suspect is Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt), a Mexican restaurateur who reminds Gru of El Macho, a once potent bad guy bent on destruction. As minions are pinched, Margo falls in love with Eduardos son Antonio (Moises Arias), and Dr. Nefario quits the fruit preserve game, Gru is left to save the world, which isn't nearly as frightening as being honest with his feelings for Lucy.

Inoffensive yet undercooked, Despicable Me took its time revealing a personality and storytelling drive, though its interest in CG-animated silly business was refreshing, rarely halting the antics to adhere to emotional bullet points the competition is often slavish to. The sequel continues the misadventures of Gru, whos now a family man seen dressing up as a fairy princess for Agness delight, also turning his cavernous lair into a food factory with hopes to erase his supervillain past for good, much to the concern of Dr. Nefario, whos looking for more of a challenge. The next logical step for Grus dramatic progression is one of heroism, and the opportunity arrives with the Anti-Villain League invitation, offering the once malevolent man a shot as toppling evil for a change, which happens to be housed in a domed mall filled with cutesy shop names and lively tenants. Suddenly, Grus a secret agent, with Lucy his partner and a few minions along for support. Despicable Me 2 doesnt cough up a radical plot, but its passable, making distinct moves to inch away from the originals satiric narrative interests.

The mall subplot is a letdown, with the script initially promising an expansive space teeming with suspicious types, allowing Gru and Lucy to pore through tenant behavior. Instead of many, we meet two: Eduardo and wigmaker Floyd (Ken Jeong), and its clear from the outset whos the actual guilty party. Even for a family film, the mystery isn't very mysterious, a deflating realization that keeps Despicable Me 2 from trouncing its predecessor in the tomfoolery department, missing a chance to expand the suspect list and widen the potential for humor. However, actual jokes aren't exactly a priority for directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, who stuff the effort with bathroom humor, including the use of a fart gun to score cheap laughs. Despicable Me 2 is rarely laugh out loud funny, but neither was the original, always falling frustratingly short of a rollicking good time.

Welcome here are the voice actors, who once again topple expectations for lazy reads by delivering oddball characters and flighty emphasis. Carell is wonderful as Gru, managing his habitual silliness through the glue of a thick accent, which often accentuates the hilarity of his groans and growls. Wiig is a terrific addition to the cast (she actually had a small role in the original picture), matching her co-star with her own spastic behaviors, gifted some vocal honey to balance out the cartoon push of Carells characterization. The films best scenes feature Gru and Lucys developing attraction, with rubbery animation keeping up with the inspired performances, creating a likable pair that naturally feeds into the sequels obsession with the ex-supervillains disastrous love life.
Despicable Me 2 also sees the return of the popular minions, who blast the screen with gibberish and pratfalls, giggling at fart noises and serve up obscure pop culture references (because kids today cant get enough Carmen Miranda and Love Boat jokes?). They even participate in a few musical numbers to make themselves useful. With their own movie on the way for 2014, it seems strange for Despicable Me 2 to be so minion-minded, but its hard to discount the popularity of the squealing creatures, who once again light up the screen with their goggle-eyed wackiness.

Visually Despicable Me 2 does more than what the film itself can offer with an AVC encoded 1080p transfer in 2.40:1. A powerful blend of colors assault the senses here, as there is no contrast noise and very little breakdown. Blacks are deep and rich, while brighter colors practically sparkle on the screen. And with an incredibly forceful DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1 mix to announce itself, you barely feel like you're sitting at home while watching a DVD instead of at the theater. While its no big screen blockbuster, Despicable Me 2 does well for what it offers. No source noise and solid punch from the rear speakers make you feel every ray gun blast and childs giggle.

Theres more than just a missing serum for Gru to combat in Despicable Me 2. With Margo going boy crazy, hes also put into a particularly painful parenthood position, developing the domestic interests of the script. However, big action eventually takes over in the final act, with furious jelly-gun combat supplying visual invention and a refreshing scale to the adventure, inching the sequel past the original in terms of eye candy and climactic creativity. Its not much of an improvement, but Despicable Me 2 capably delivers the goods with minimal strain. A solid visual and audio presentation on Blu-ray with some fun special features make for a decent package and certainly worthy entertainment for the kids this holiday season.",1386028800,,6683,5.0653950953678475

So I'll just say: if you like computer-animated comedies, you'll love this. Get it. (If you can display 3D, even better, movies like this are made for it.)

One of the telling aspects of a great animated film is the LIGHT. And DM2 has it in spades.

By the way, I think they make a little mistake by featuring basically only the Minions on covers and such. I feared that the other characters, for example the girls, would take a secondary place to them. Fortunately this is not true, it has a full character gallery, all used well.

One of the best new characters is Lucy Wilde, agent of the Anti-Villain League. This adorable redhead is a mess of delightful contradictions: She is bubbly, inventive, tough and super-resourceful, a bit bashful, clumsy, slightly sadistic and yet loving, and a martial-arts master.",1385856000,,965,4.6982248520710055

4931602,5,7799444371,"I really liked the first movie and I was a little worried this one was going to pale in comparison. Luckily, all my fears were put to rest, since I found a movie that is funny, has a bunch of other elements incorporated in the story, and leaves you feeling good. In the first movie, the conversion of Gru from villain to good guy was the focus of the plot. The challenge now was to determine how to carry the story forward.

I have to give high marks for the ideas used to create the plot in this one. Gru is dealing with going from being a villain to making jelly and jam. In this setting, a villain is developing some scary threats and he is offered an opportunity to help the good guys. When you add elements of romance to this story, and some fascinating characters, the stage is set for a truly fun film.

There are other aspects that make this movie great. I loved the fact that the minions get a more prominent role here. These guys are fantastic! The addition of Lucy, an employee of the anti-villain league that rocks Gru's world, is a welcome one. Kristen Wiig does an outstanding job with the voice acting, matching up well with the great Steve Carell.

Overall this is an enjoyable movie for the whole family. Just sit down and get ready to have a great time.",1385683200,,1271,4.309623430962343

4931615,4,7799444371,"Look, I'm not a monster.

Whenever those little yellow minions came on the screen, I laughed my heart out. They are easily the funniest characters in any children's film, like, EVER. Their antics never, ever fail to amuse, and I see a bright, banana-filled future for them. Gut-bursting moments include one minion's ill-fated attempt at making jam, and Gru's immature fire brigade (""BEE-DO, BEE-DO!"").

So it's a pity then, that the majority of the film is given to Gru's (Steve Carell) stale and rather bland relationship with his girls - Agnes, Whatever, and Blah Blah, or something, some rather dull spy work, and a very unthreatening and uninteresting villain's plot. Let's talk a bit about the villain. In a movie where pretty much ALL your characters are villains, or people operating deep in the shades of grey...you really need a strong antagonist. Despicable Me had that strong antagonist in Vector - a hilarious, nerdy, comically ineffective but dastardly bad guy. Despicable Me TWO has the rather unthreatening and unfunny Eduardo.

Really Dreamworks? It thought you learned your lesson. The only reason we forked out close to a billion dollars to see DESPICABLE ME 2 was for minions - those little yellow bundles of instant comedy.

When you see past the hilarity of stylized slapstick, you find a film that is clichd, rather bland, and trying way too hard. A sizable disappointment, which is not to say unfunny. I tremendously enjoyed watching Despicable Me 2, and was heaving with laughter half the time. It just could have been so much better.  My rating? 6/10 - For the fan.",1383350400,,1590,4.940074906367041
4931616,4,7799444371,"In Despicable Me 2 Felonious Gru is no longer a villain  perhaps not even the hero of the new movie. Not that he has become dull or unfunny after his retirement. It is just that he has become, well, ordinary. Fortunately, the film itself is very entertaining thanks largely to the yellow-colored creatures Minions.

Gru, who was like a cross between Mr. Bean and Dr. Evil in the original, still looks the same, but he is now a (basically) nice person and caring father of three daughters Margo, Edith and Agnes. A new adventure begins when Gru meets Lucy Wilde, an agent sent from a secret organization called Anti-Villain League or AVL.

About half of the film follows their joint investigation into the case of a stolen chemical PX-41, substance that changes living things into purple people-eaters, and the romantic relationship between the ex-supervillian and an active-duty AVL operative. The idea is fine, though Gru of the sequel is rather a different person, more likable but less interesting than in the original.

In spite of the weak storyline, however, the sequel works because of the horde of Minions and their funny antics, as well as the unique and colorful designs of animation. The enjoyable film comes with a sort of teaser of the upcoming spin-off of the franchise Minions scheduled to be released in a few years.

The Minions are as daft and silly, yet supportive as ever, but they aren't the only thing to like - the girls are still complete peaches and Agnes will still charm your socks off.  The League gives Gru a fresh spark and Eduardo provides a worthy challenge as Minions mysteriously disappear.  Pierre Coffin's influence continues to be a fresh breath into cinema as there's plenty of fun and mystery, spun far away from the tired retreads of Hollywood.  Looking forward to more.

The first Despicable Me was one of the best cartoons I had seen in a long time. Hilarious and enjoyable for both children and adults, alike. That being said, I think that is the reason I went in with such high expectations for the second. If you put your expectations up so high, you're only setting up for failure. So that's my own fault. Had I gone in expecting this movie to downright suck, I would have been pleasantly surprised. As I sat in the theatre, I found myself wanting so much to like it, forcing laughs even. It was still good, definitely not awful. It had really cute and funny moments but there was something missing. They were clearly trying to hard imo, and you could feel it in some of the jokes. The first movie was effortless. My kids did like this one but not nearly as much as the original; that's often expected with sequels. This was enjoyable, and heck, I'll still own it, but it fell short, on it's purple minion face.(: Bo-boo-beep Bo-boo-beep. You can't help but love those minions!",1379808000,2,1054,4.489583333333333

4931632,5,7799444371,"I'm not ashamed to say that `Despicable Me' was one of my favorite movies of 2010.  Granted, the year itself was not a very great one, with only a handful of truly amazing films being made (`The Social Network', `Blue Valentine' and `Toy Story 3' being the best of them), but even still, `Despicable Me' is a respectable and entertaining film that made something unique, charming and completely original out of a genre that has had its fair share of redundancies.  While it seemed to be all over the place at times, it was truly a breath of fresh air.

I was excited for `Despicable Me 2'; really excited.  Like I said, I really liked the first one and so the idea of Gru and his newfound family coming back for another adventure had me anticipating something special.

I can't say that `Despicable Me 2' is anything new or fresh when you consider where the plot is going (far more generic and predictable than the first film), but these characters are so joyous that one can't help but fall in love with their whole troop.  The kids are hilarious, especially young Agnes, and the inclusion of Lucy is great, especially since both Wiig and Carell have great comedic chemistry here.

The plot follows newly `straight-laced' Gru as he is pulled into the dangerous world of espionage by the Anti-Villain League.  They need Gru to use his master bad-guy skills to help capture a real bad-guy who has stolen a mutation serum.  Gru is hesitant, but his current profession (he's making jams and jellies in his basement laboratory) isn't working out so good for him, so he decides to give it a go.  He's paired up with hyperactive and completely star-struck Lucy (she loved Gru's work as a villain) and together they scope out the mall looking for the bad guy.  Gru has his hunches, but it becomes clear that those hunches are clouded with personal feelings when his eldest daughter Margo falls for the charming young son of the man Gru thinks is the real baddie.

The usual lovelorn antics occur with the parent despising the idea of his daughter seeking out a love interest.  Daughter's heart gets broken, father mends the tears, father hides from love, father falls in love, everyone is happy.  It isn't really the story that makes this film work, but the way that it is crafted.  There is just so much to love here.  The dialog is sharp, the character development is heartwarming, the criminal activity is comical and the minions are hysterical (yes, I'm one of those people who laugh at everything they do).

This was a great family film, one that was bursting at every seam with something to enjoy.  It's not as good as the film one, but it's make good on the promise and actually delivers a sequel that is on par with what we were originally presented with.

I give this an A-, and hope to GOD that it winds up on Oscar's ballot over the likes of `Epic'.  This is honestly the best animated film I've seen this year (yes, better than `Monster's University') and I really would love to see it recognized, especially since the first one was denied despite being better than two of Oscar's nominees that year.",1378425600,6,3105,4.600725952813067

I didn't see the movie with my 3 y.o. niece (who turned 3 today - time is going by too fast). My sister (her mom) asked if she should see it, and I think that there is indeed one part that she might be afraid of (big purple monster). But that's only because it looked like one of the monsters from Monsters, Inc., which Evan got scared of. But, there was a 2 1/2 y.o. boy who loved the movie who also loved Monsters, Inc. So to each kid there own. I'd probably see this again on the cable or something. Sis is still debating if she wants to take Evan because that girl looovvvveessss the Minions. I think she'll like the Minion movie more probably.

Funny thing is that our theater was having problems with the sound and stopped the movie in the middle of the show. The theater staff explained the pause - but no one seemed to understand what the problem was. Turned out there was a heart beat sound throughout the movie. They tried to fix it, but I still noticed the beat. So staff worker ended up passing out free movie guest passes. So, Wo Ho!! Free Movie! I feel lucky.

The sequel does, however, have more of an adult theme. Stealing the moon is a concept a six-year-old could understand, but preventing chemical warfare is a bit more of a complex idea. Additionally, there are many references to music and culture from the 60's-80's that would be lost on children, or even teenagers.

4931645,4,7799444371,"The minions are back for the 2nd time! I remember seeing Despicable Me in theaters, back in July 2010. That was a long time ago. I have to admit I was a little disappointed by the film when I first watched the trailers, cause I felt that they were gonna over use the minions and spend less time on the human characters, including Gru.  They didn't which surprised me but I was happy that they didn't over use them.  The minions.  I love em, they cranked out a few of the jokes, and while the jokes don't come out as many as you would wish this film still gives out a few decent  jokes.  I've only seen 3 animated films of this year out of 5 that have been released, and this is by far my favorite.  Also I tip my hat off to the trailer creators who  gave us minions, and no story, which  helped keep what would happen in the movie a  mystery, even though  I was angry at not seeing any footage from the film till March 2013, I was still happy.  Let's start with what's wrong with this film which includes the jokes, plot, and villain.  The jokes as I explained earlier don't come flying out and we only get a few at a time, which is but a miner issue to note. I still found the film funny in the most parts.  The plot has got to be the weak spot in the film.  The plots simple, too simple to follow. I get that this is a children's movie but please why not make it a little trickier to follow, because I started to get bored by the overly simple plot that barely grabbed my father's attention who attended the movies with me.  The major issue is the villain.  The voice acting for the villain is excellent and the character himself, it's just they didn't make him a very good villain.  I have to say this is a weaker villain than from the previous movie, believe it or not.  If they showed more of his scary and macho ness, he would make for a less tamed villain, but he's not and it really makes his character kiddie appropriate. It's really disappointing because he seems pretty cool with the shark and the grenade but not after that short 5 minutes. Well after that short bad moments let's get on with the many good things with this film, which includes the  voice cast, animation, characters, minions, music, script,  switch of voice actors.  The voice cast is excellent! Steve Carrel truly knows what he's doing as Gru, and his voice acting is excellent! Kristen Wiig who was excellent in the first film as Mrs. Hattie, is back and bubbly as Lucy Wilde. She was excellent. Ken Jeung and Russell Brand are excellent too.  The big additions to the cast include Steve Coogan as Silas Ramsbottom, whose voice is  very convincing and excellent and finally the best of the newbie's and the second best of the cast behind Steve Carrel, is Benjamin Bratt as the  incredibly tame villain, Eduardo/El Macho.  Originally Al Pacino was cast as the voice of the character and had recorded all of his lines and animation for the character was already complete too, he stepped out because of creative differences on how the character should go.  I was upset at first due to being a fan of Pacino, and I still am, but I have got to say congratulations to Benjamin who was able to easily voice the character and his hard work as he had a week or two I believe too record his lines because the movie was going to be released in two months. Bratt did an excellent job as the character and I couldn't think of anyone who could have done it any better.  Top notch voice work from him.  The animation is excellent!  I loved the  animation done on the mall and characters; while cartoony it's excellent and sharp.  A beautifully film to watch, while he Monsters University film I felt had better animation this comes close to it! And better yet they used less money to create the excellent animation costing the most amount of money Illumination has ever spent on making an animated film which is 76-79 million that's not bad.  The characters are great! Lucy Wilde is funny and yet annoying at times a heartwarming character that I truly enjoyed watching. Floyd Eaggleson is also funny. The little wig making Chinese man is besides excellently voiced, is excellently funny and while his role is small, he is still one of my favorites.  I've already talked about the minions, but I think another word or too will do it. I think the minions are perfect; they are funny and my favorites.  The music is while not as memorable as the first films soundtrack is still excellent! You have to love the ""Despicable Me"" song.  I loved it! I was fairly disappointed that this film didn't include the song from the trailers, which played while Lucy kidnapped Gru.  But oh well you know, it's just to catch people attention.  The script includes loads of excellent dialogue that we get from El Macho and others.  A few clever one liners and things like that, some dialogue that mimics other things and stuff.  Now I already talked about this but I have decided that all of Benjamin Bratt's hard work deserves more recognizing and praise as he truly was excellent.  He worked hard to match the mouth movements for the animated character and matched it perfectly! An excellent cast member.  All an All Despicable Me 2, is not better than the first film and is more tame, and less enjoyable for adult audiences then the first film but still manages to  contain the magic with an excellent voice cast,  excellent colorful characters and those  loveably funny minions. B+
P.S we will see in December 2014 a spin off featuring the Minions solely. I'm not interested but we'll see. Are too many minions, too much? We'll know in December 2014.  Expect another Despicable Me movie because of the excellent  box office performance as well.",1375228800,5,5697,4.476744186046512
4931646,4,7799444371,"Sequels are a tricky thing. They have to somehow extend the premise of the original movie to new areas while still hitting all the notes that the audience liked from that first one. Two goals that head in different directions. Despicable Me 2 largely manages the task though.

It is a little less focussed than the first move as it tries to give all the characters something to do while simultaneously introducing the new plot. But once it gets all the plates spinning it keeps things going nicely and pulls everything together for the end.

It's also a movie that's very aware of its dual audience. So we have fart jokes and people giggling about the word bottom, but we also get pop culture references and nods to old Bond movies amongst other things.

The voice cast remains strong with Steve Carrell and Kristen Wiig doing a great job anchoring the movie. Wiig's character Lucy is in many ways the key element here as the plot takes the next obvious step of trying to add a mother figure to the family that Gru acquired in the first film. Again we're not really lighting the world on fire with originality but it's all done with polish and flair.

And then of course there are the minions. In many ways the star of the Despicable Me franchise, and clearly the producers know it. The minions get more time to be cartoony and silly this time round. A lot of it doesn't exactly add to the plot, but it had my 8 year olds laughing hysterically. So mission accomplished right?

All round a great family film. Not all the jokes hit, but it throws out so many there's always something new to make you smile and if it uses some very familiar plot elements, well at least it does it with style.",1374883200,11,1689,4.453074433656958

All of this is shown on the screen along with the rabbit's pained expression when he gets the shot.

In Despicable Me, they were the bickering followers of supervillain Gru (voiced by the always funny Steve Carell), who adopted three little girls as part of one of his evil plots. In Despicable Me 2, Gru, now a devoted dad, has reformed and is attempting to start a legitimate business. He's turned his lab into a high-tech kitchen for making jellies and jams. Too bad nobody, including the Minions, likes the stuff they're making. His longtime sidekick, Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), grows restless--as restless as a hard-of-hearing geezer mad scientist can possibly be--and decides to leave Gru's lab and go back to evildoing with another supervillain. Gru reluctantly says goodbye to his soon-to-be-former accomplice and the Minions give Nefario a twenty-one fart gun salute (yep,I said fart gun--it wasn't a typo).

When the Minions start to disappear, Gru doesn't notice--at first. He's busy deflecting the matchmaking attempts of an annoying neighbor and his own daughters. The youngest, Agnes, struggles with her role in a Mothers Day pageant at her school, feeling the lack of a mother of her own. Gru is also concerned that eldest daughter Margo (voiced by Miranda Cosgrove), now a teenager, has discovered boys.

Enter Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig, who provided the voice of snarky orphanage director Miss Hattie in the original film), an agent for the Anti-Villains League, who kidnaps Gru and Minions Stuart and Dave and takes them to AVL headquarters, where AVL Director Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) tries to recruit Gru to help find a supervillain who possesses a dangerous formula that turns anyone injected with it into an unstoppable purple killing machine. He and Lucy end up partners, but at first they can't get along, and every attempt they make to find the supervillain ends badly...starting with a restaurant break-in, during which they run afoul of a chicken (sorry, I couldn't resist).

When little Agnes declares that Gru loves Lucy, Gru not only denies it, he insists he doesn't even like Lucy. Typical male...denying his feelings right up to the moment he says ""I do!""

The AVL thinks they've found their man when wigmaker Floyd (Ken Jeong) is arrested. Gru is dismissed in spite of his insistence that restaurateur Eduardo (voiced by Benjamin Bratt) is the real culprit...and with Nefario's help is turning the Minions into monsters. By the time his suspicions are proven correct, Lucy is on a flight to Australia and her next assignment.

Will Lucy return? Does Nefario's conscience get the better of him? Do Gru and Lucy have a future together? Will Margo, Edith and Agnes finally get a mom? And what of the Minions? Will they be yellow and cute again in time for next year's Minion Movie?

The movie felt rushed, the editing could have been better to cut out the slow parts. The scenes b/w dialogue were slow and awkward (the theater was silent enough to hear people eating popcorn 10 rows away). Kristen Wigg was an overacting animated version of an early Jim Carey, slapstick humor can only carry you so far and the movie was predictable from the introduction of her character. My eldest daughter said that they will probably get married at the end. We even knew where Dr. Nefario would turn up and what was happening to the minions. People rushed to get out of the theater not even waiting for the closing credits. I even saw a few families leave b/c it couldn't hold their kids attention. Very disappionted in the sequel. No one stood up to clap there was nothing to suggest an entertained audience just one that was forced through the motions for the sake of their kids. Ken DeJong's character had a small role and truly a waste of his talent. Go see Monster's University for truly ha ha sidesplitting moments (my daughters' complained that the adults were laughing too loud too hear anything), even Turbo has better moments that D.M. 2. I will not purchase this on Blu-Ray. I wish I could ask for a refund since it cost us over $60 for the movie and some food. I guess the only good thing is it was nice and cool compared to the 90+ degree weather outside and a great time to catch up on some sleep (yes some little kid feel asleep). That's my rant.

4931651,5,7799444371,"As stated in my earlier review for Despicable Me, this movie was on my 2013 must watch list. So after its near 3 week highly successful run, here is my review for: Despicable Me 2.

Despicable Me 2 brings back Steve Carrell as everyone's favorite bad guy, Gru. Also returning are Miranda Cosgrove as Margo, Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario, and Elsie Fisher and Dana Gaier as Agnes and Edith. Newcomers to the movie include Benjamin Bratt as Eduardo, Moises Arias as Antonio, Steve Coogan as Mr Silas Ramsbottom, and although she played a minor role in the first film, Kristen Wigg portrays the lady with the lipstick, Lucy Wilde. The cast did an excellent job.

The story line is highly enjoyable, not quite as charming as the first film in my opinion but still very enjoyable. There is the right amount of humor, the animation is well put together, and the minions (as always), are at it again.

My complaint that it is not as memorable as the first is easily overlooked Thanks to Despicable Me 2 being so smart. It has the smarts, the fun, and still has the heart that made us fall in love with the original movie. I have a feeling that a 3rd sequel will be made in due time; while in the meantime, the minions themselves will be getting a movie all on their own in July of 2015. To close out my review If you have not seen this movie, What are you waiting for? GO SEE Despicable Me 2! I can guarantee and confirm that you and your family will have a blast.

4931653,4,7799444371,"***This review may contain spoilers***

  Without a doubt, this is one crazy, clever, and outrageous bullet train of an animated movie that does its energetic best to wring out the laughs (and mostly succeeds).  Part of  ""Despicable Me 2's"" (hereafter DM2) success are its inspired plot borrowings such as ""The Incredibles"", the Bond movie series, ""Lilo and Stitch"" and even ""Cars 2"" to embroil everyone's favorite Uncle Fester/Dr. Evil hybrid ex-supervillian Gru (Steve Carell) in a world dominance plot using cute beasties turned into purple, fanged wrecking balls.

  Another part of its success is the gradual revelation of Gru's more positive qualities such as his growing, more tolerant, and sometimes excessive compassion towards his adoptive children Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), the eldest and a budding teenager, tomboyish middle child Edith (Dana Gaier), and button-cute unicorn fanatic Agnes (Elsie Fisher), the youngest.  We also must not forget the winning, prepossessing debut of  resourceful Anti-Villain League agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig, using her Lola Bunny voice from ""The Looney Tunes Show"") who recruits the somewhat reluctant Gru to go uncover with her at a mall bakery to uncover which of the mall proprietors is behind the purple mutant plot.  The flabby but suave and mysterious Eduardo Perez/El Macho (Benjamin Bratt), the mall Mexican restaurant owner with an alluring son (Moiss Arias) involved with Margo, also keeps the proceedings hopping.  All of the aforementioned stuff, in my opinion, works as smart, coherent entertainment.

  But what powers and keeps this bullet train together is one of the most insidiously and surprisingly endearing creations of any movie - the little old Minions.  These slyly captivating characters prove the old adage that introducing lots of cute, fun, silly, little people in a movie is a surefire, lucrative way to lure people to an animated film. Characters such as the Smurfs, Pokemon, and the 627 experiments from ""Lilo and Stitch"" have certainly proven that.  They can easily capture young children's interest.

  But unlike the Smurfs, etc., Minions have crossover appeal to parents as well.  Sure they babble childishly and otherwise act like overstimulated, quarrelsome brats.  But the Minions are also industrious, satirical and hip assistants with some adult sensibilities, always eager to help Gru with his radically new espionage job, parenting, and love life predicaments.  These Twinkie-shaped, blue over-all wearing dynamos keep DM2's pace from ever flagging.

  This is not to say that the Minions completely detract from the main storyline.  I think we want to see Gru surmount childhood disappointments, his uncertainties and his sinister past to be a good do-gooder, better parent, and perhaps a suitable match for Lucy.  But DM2 wouldn't be quite the same without the Minions serving as Greek chorus, comedy relief, and (mostly) trustworthy Gru sidekicks AND foster children.  No wonder Illumination Entertainment plans an exclusive feature for them.  Now if they can only introduce a Minionette.",1374451200,12,3081,5.425263157894737
4931654,4,7799444371,"The despicable moon-stealing super-villain Gru and his army of little minions make their hilarious return in 2013's ""Despicable Me 2.""  Gru has gone straight and is busy single-parenting his three adorable adopted little girls Margo, Agnes, and Edith while dodging the neighborhood matchmaker.  He and Dr. Nefario, another former super villain, are partners in a not-very-successful jam and jelly enterprise.  But life has some surprises in store for Gru, beginning with his kidnapping from Agnes' birthday party by the secret agent Lucy Wilde, in a sequence that would have done credit to any recent James Bond movie.

The Anti-Villain League or AVL wants Gru's help in locating another super villain, the one who made off with an entire Arctic research station and a secret formula that turns people into monsters.  AVL suspects the villain may be hiding out in a large mall.  The mismatched Gru and Agent Lucy are assigned to the case, which has them checking out suspects, including a salsa restaurant owner and a wig seller.  To go further would be to impose order on a plot that is intentionally chaotic and over the top.  Suffice it to say that in the end, the world will be saved, Gru will conquer his fears about dating women, and the girls will have a new mother.

The animation is even better than last time. Much more screen time is given to the antics of the minions, who have developed distinct personalities.  There is plenty of cartoon action, more than enough to keep the kids entertained in their seats.  There are also lots of sight gags and jokes about growing up, parenting and relationships to keep the adults in the audience amused.

4931657,4,7799444371,"When it comes to creating a movie that fits every age group, it is not easy!  ""Despicable Me 2"" has the right formula to be successful.

Gru, the main character, transforms from the most evil villain to become a loving father of his three adopted daughters, and make a living of making jam.  He is more occupied with birthday parties.  Life is good, but not exciting.

In this sequel, he is being recruited to detect the villain who has stolen a devastating toxin from the Arctic research center.  The toxin, if injected, would turn timid species into the most destructive monsters.  Gru now has a beautiful agent Judy as his partner.  The scene, when Judy kidnaps Gru to the underwater agent center, has some reminiscence of James Bond Movie (magic car, chase scene, car turns into water vehicles ...).  Judy is funny and combative, ready to destruct any suspicious items including a bunch of cupcakes.  The two starts with surveillance of the occupants in a shopping mall.  Very quickly, Gru narrows the target (Almacho), but could this be that a bias, as Almacho's son asks Gru's eldest daughter for a date?

The three cute daughters add flavors to the movie.  The elder one is old enough to use the internet to look for dating services for Gru; and she herself has been attracted to Almacho's son in an unplanned encounter in the mall.  The youngest, hoping to have a mom, has been thrilled to see Gru's new partner Judy.  His minions continue to serve his master, they are capable, loyal and fun-loving - who doesn't want to have some at home?

As the story progresses, the minions were injected the toxins which turned them into purple and ugly minis with spiky hair.  The climax comes as Gru was asked by Almacho to join him to rule the world with the purple monsters?  Would Gru be in?  How could he find the antidote to rescue his minions?  How would the partnership of Gru and Judy end?

Gru is likeable, he is not handsome, he is bald, and he is human - when he is love-struck, he is the best person; when he is disgruntled, his evil side re-appears.  Is it by design that he speaks non-American English - is his accent Russian, French or some middle east?  Even his genius assistant is speaking like British English.  If Superman represents all-perfect hero, Gru is definitely not but it makes an easier formula for plots.

The movie is filled with light-hearted humor,good for all ages.  The story is simple, yet has some good surprises.  The characters, all unique, are impeccably designed.

If you are looking for a family-friendly movie and heart-warming smile in an afternoon, this will be a very good choice.",1373760000,3,2626,4.662309368191721
4931658,4,7799444371,"Because of the fact the movie is still fairly new and at least half of the world hasn't seen it, I'll keep this review sparse.

When ""Despicable Me"" came out in 2010, I didn't see it as a film that could generate a good sequel (although making $540 million at the box office pretty much made it a certainty). If this had been released by Disney instead of Universal, odds were this would have ended up like one of those straight-to-DVD types that were so common in the 1990s and early 2000s. But this sequel is one of the rare movies that tops the original in terms of plot, pacing and even music (if you're a fan of 70s R&B and disco, you're in for a treat), so it's more than deserving of its own shot at the big screen.

Positive No. 1: You don't even have to have seen the original to follow what's going on here. This was great, because my family and I didn't remember much about the first one (which says something in itself).

No. 2: The pacing is well-done. There's not really a slow moment; the movie chugs along from second to fifth gear admirably throughout.

No. 3: The script is solid. Sure, there's a few plot cliches, but you get past them because you spend a good chunk of the movie laughing hysterically. I have to admit that part of the ending was different than I expected, which makes the film all the more great.

No. 4: The film is loaded with subtle and not-so-subtle verbal, visual and written references -- whether it's ""I Love Lucy,"" ""The Man With the Golden Gun,"" ""The Spy Who Loved Me,"" ""Footloose,"" or others -- to where you feel like you need to see it again to look for more. Lucy's Southern California cell phone number, by the way, is a real working number, not one of those 555-1212 items.

No. 5: Gru's yellow ""minions"" put the film over the top in terms of humor. Try watching the scene where several of them are doing a version of Boyz II Men's ""I Swear"" without spitting popcorn out across the theater. My wife tells me that part of what they're saying throughout the film is in French. Given the highly French production team, I wouldn't doubt it...although maybe it's backwards French. And they do all of this without being overly crude (families with young kids can rest easy). No wonder they're getting their own movie in Christmas 2014.

My only negative: Don't bother with the 3D version -- there's really not that much here, animation-wise, to merit spending the extra $4 or $5 per ticket. Don't get me wrong -- the animation is solid (although we appear to have maxed out after ""Toy Story 3"" in terms of what can be done on screen). But aside from one scene, you can watch the basic 2D version and not feel like you're missing anything. And you'll avoid the eyestrain-induced headache.

All in all, an ""A"" grade. Sorry, Superman, Lone Ranger, Hangover 3 guys and Will Smith -- here's the real summer blockbuster.",1373760000,29,2858,4.461685823754789

4931661,5,7799444371,"2010 was a great year for animated movies: Toy Story 3 (which made me cry), Despicable Me (which made my wife cry (which is not to say that TS3 didn't make her cry, but it's much more impressive to make me cry at a movie than her)), and Megamind. So, although we really loved Despicable Me when we saw, it still got overshadowed by the other two. Meaning we own the other two, but I never bought Despicable Me despite the incredible voice work by Steve Carell. I feel bad about that, now.

Which may seem kind of silly, to feel bad about not buying a DVD, but, really, we all, the whole family, loved Despicable Me. When it came out. But, see, the news of Despicable Me 2 didn't really do that much for me. It was kind of a shrug and ""oh, yeah, that's cool,"" but I wasn't dying to go see it or anything. I'm sure that's because we haven't watched it again since 2010, and I'd forgotten how good it was. My daughter, however, was dying to go see it. I'm pretty sure she wants minions of her own.

So we went to see Despicable Me 2, and I'm pretty sure it's the best movie I've seen all summer. Okay, second best. Star Trek beats it but not by much. At any rate, it was so much better than Monsters University, which is its actual competition. Not only was Despicable more funny than Monsters, but it had all of the heart and soul that Monsters was lacking. And it made my wife cry.

I don't actually have anything negative to say about the movie. The closest thing to a negative is that the plot is almost conventional, but, see, it's only almost conventional. The fact that there is an attempt to recruit Gru to the AVL (Anti-Villain League) at the beginning of the movie, because of his expertise as a former villain, puts things just off-kilter enough that you don't really know which direction the movie is going. And I won't tell you which, because that would just spoil it.

And, I have to say, that scene where Gru is on the phone with the people who failed to send the Fairy Godmother to his adopted daughter's birthday party... well, that was classic. As a father, I've made those calls, and they had that bit down perfectly. All the way to the hanging up and... well, that, also, would be telling. But there are so many of  those moments incorporated into the movie that it made it great for kids and adults.

The animation was terrific. The voice work from the actors was excellent. The minions were funnier then ever.

Wait, now that I think about it, there is one issue with the movie. The title. Because Gru isn't so despicable anymore. I can't wait for a third one, and I'm gonna go have to make sure I pick up both of these movies, now. It's great stuff.",1373500800,3,2669,4.304780876494024
4931662,1,7799444371,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!!

I really enjoyed the first film, but I did not have high hopes for the second-- after all, what gave the original all of it's charm (meeting the girls, seeing the relationship between them and Gru blossom) had been wrapped up in a little bow...what else needed to be said?

Five minutes into the second film, I realized that the writers agreed with me.  They had nothing to say.  So this is about 90 minutes of minions, minions and more minions- oh, and two lame romances I can't imagine either the kids watching the movie or the parents who accompanied them could give a damn about.

I knew I was in for a LONG 90 minutes when I realized that the fart gun- a harmless, three-second gag in the first film, was going to be shown as a freaking institution in the second.  ""20-fart salute?""  Um, the gun was made by ACCIDENT in the first film.  Dr. Nefario said ""ok, I wondered why anyone would have any use for this...""  There are TWENTY in the second film?  And it's used TWICE? Wasn't funny ONCE!

Then the romance storylines.  Groan.  Nobody cares if Gru finds a wife (including Gru.)  NOBODY cares if the oldest girl finds a boyfriend.  I'm grateful that the opportunity for product placement when we find she's texting someone was passed by at least.  The girl Gru falls for is annoying as hell, and a really good reason not to see Despicable Me 3, if the rest of this mess wasn't enough already.

Finally, I was really annoyed at the dropped plot point concerning the villain's kid.  The villain has a young son- yet he's willing to commit murder and transform thousands of minions- and HIMSELF- into a rampaging, homicidal beast...umm, if he does this, who is going to take care of the kid?  We kind of needed to see some resolution here- if the villain is now captured and facing prison, what becomes of his son?

Anyway, this film was a chore to sit through, so unlike the first film, which was a pleasure I've gone back to several times.  What a shame.",1373500800,24,1987,4.479108635097493
4931663,4,7799444371,"The summer of 2013 will likely be remembered as a period of sequels for the computer generated animated feature film segment.  Sure there are some original pieces sliding into the fray (Epic & Turbo for example) but the lion's share of the media attention falls squarely on Pixar's Monsters University, Universal Pictures'/ Illumination's Despicable Me 2 and already the trailers are beginning to circulate for Disney's third entry into the Cars universe: Planes.

Depending on who you are, the animated sequel thing can work- look at the Toy Stories and Shreks, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascars, and so on.  That said, it didn't come as too much of a surprise when rumors started circulating a couple of years back that 2010's surprise breakaway hit about a villain turned good guy would be getting a direct sequel as well as a spin-off film featuring the minions a year after that.

That brings us to the sequel itself- Despicable Me 2 does away with fancy tag lines and usual sequel fluffery and drops its viewer quickly into a brief reprise of Gru's life as a former supervillain turned domestic daddy caring for three orphan girls.  This time around we learn that his vast resources, technology and manpower (or Minion power as the case may be) are devoted to the business of producing a line of jellies and jams.

It doesn't take long for Gru's simple life of parenthood/ Smuckers wannabeism to come to a halt when Lucy Wilde, an agent representing the Anti-Villain League (AVL) abducts the baldheaded mastermind and takes him to a top secret meeting to plead for his assistance in solving a caper involving the disappearance of an Arctic laboratory responsible for the chemical agent PX-41.  PX-41 is dangerous because of its ability to transform mammals injected with it into indestructible purple, wild-haired killing machines.

Intel leads the search into a local mall of all places, where a storeowner is suspected of harboring the precious chemical.  Posing as operators of a food court bakery, Gru and Lucy are assigned the task of figuring out who is behind the lab's disappearance before they have an opportunity to unleash the dreaded PX-41 on the world.

Sure it isn't much of an extraordinarily rich plot, but it is serviceable enough to set up some genuinely funny moments and visually rich action sequences.  It's all but impossible not to find enjoyment in Steve Carell's zany delivery as Gru; especially with a script that seems to hone in perfectly on all of the nuances that make the character tick.

Love em or loathe em, the yellow gibberish-spewing Minions are back with a vengeance and lend some comical moments in a variety of disciplines from light potty humor to all out slap stick to complex visual gags the likes of which wouldn't be uncommon in an old Loony Tunes episode.  There is little doubt Illumination realizes they have struck a chord in the world's collective psyche with these guys and plan to milk the gimmick for all its worth.

Fortunately even the Minion overload doesn't take much away from the overall entertainment value of the experience- the fact of the matter is there is something to laugh with, about or at going on in nearly every single scene of the film.  Some of the gags are more in-your-face than others of course (which is sort expected in a piece that targets everyone from young children to the most cynical of adults) but certainly multiple viewings reveal layers of comedic charm one would expect from studios as refined and experienced as say Pixar or DreamWorks.

Perhaps the most notable element of the viewing experience comes from a quality that's difficult to pinpoint but unmistakable just the same: the film resonates with the same goofy, almost sublime charm that made the first one so successful.  Unlike something from Pixar that would try to awe you with cleverness or say DreamWorks where each sequence feels like it was refined a million times over in boardroom, Despicable Me 2 never feels like it's working too hard to woo its viewer.  The vivid, unbelievably rich visuals make it nearly impossible to look away while the characters simply do what they do.  In the end you find yourself laughing at Gru's dialog, the Minions' antics, Dr. Nefario's combination of brilliance and geriatrics, a new ""very macho"" villain, the unique gadgets (after all, what other movie can boast containing a 21 fart-gun salute?) or some combination of the above.

In the event that you haven't been keeping up on such things, Illumination Entertainment has been the modern day incarnation of the King Midas myth.  Beginning with the first Despicable Me and extending through Dr. Suess' The Lorax and now with this sequel that in under a week has managed to bring in more than quadruple it's $76-million dollar budget, it can truly be said everything these guys touch has turned to gold.  Well not really gold so much as yellow- with goggles and blue suspenders.",1373500800,33,4919,4.887019230769231
4931664,4,7799444371,"Better than the first - but that's not such a high bar to leap.

4931665,3,7799444371,"Despicable Me (2010) was the first offering from Universal Pictures off-shoot Illumination Entertainment, and it's financial success proved that Pixar and Dreamworks can be beaten at their own game. Unfortunately, their bunny-based follow-up Hop (2011) was riddled with myxomatosis, whilst the environmentally-conscious The Lorax (2012) was an ecological disaster as far as critics were concerned. Thankfully, Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud's Despicable Me 2 (2013) is a slick, inventive and thoroughly entertaining slice of animated nonsense that will enthral kids, amuse adults and rule at the box office.

This time round, not-so-evil supervillain Gru (Steve Carell) is officially retired and spends his days caring for his beloved adopted kids and experimenting with jam recipes (naturally). His peaceful existence is shattered, however, when he is recruited by future love interest Lucy Wilde (Kirsten Wiig) and spy master Silas Ramsbottom (Steve Coogan) to join the infamous Anti-Villain League and track down the ringleader behind the heist of a mysterious serum. Gru's number one suspect is restaurant owner Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt), a dead ringer for his former partner in crime El Macho who was last seen riding a shark strapped with dynamite (how  la mode) into the gaping chasm of a volcano twenty years previously.

Gru is one of the highlights of Carell's somewhat patchy career thus far, and although he's still very much the main character here, he's again outshone by his little yellow minions -who must be the stuff of merchandisers dreams. They are given a much more prominent role in the sequel, and whether it's their pastiche of Charles Ebbet's famous 'Lunch atop a Skyscraper' photograph or the inevitable Alien (1979) parody, practically every time they're on screen they inspire laughter. Wiig is fine as Wilde, though she does seems to be channelling Jennifer Aniston, whilst Bratt's Eduardo (who was to be voiced by Al Pacino) is a fun, if not very villainous villain.

There is a ten-minute lull midway through this feisty sequel and the necessity of the film's 3D conversion is as debatable as ever (though the patented short minion film over the end credits remains impressive and proves that three dimensions can sometimes be better than two). Yet, despite a few dropped balls, Despicable Me 2 is silly but superlative family entertainment. With enough sugar in your system and an open mind, there's plenty on offer for both young and old.",1373241600,3,2470,5.261421319796955

4931668,3,7799444371,"""Despicable Me"" was about fatherhood, in which archvillain Gru (Steve Carell) discovers there's more to life than stealing the moon, like adopting three adorable moppets: eldest Margo (Miranda Cosgrove) who is just discovering boys,  ninja-in-training Edith (Dana Gaier) and unicorn-obsessed Agnes (Elsie Fisher). ""Despicable Me 2"" is about Gru completing the standard family unit by finding a mate. This is an entertaining sequel that fails to surpass the original, at least due in part to this single plot point -- the villains, the gadgets, and the minions are all ancillary to the object of Gru's romance, Anti-Villain League (AVL) agent Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig).

Lucy's the best thing about the film.  The animators have captured every comic tic of Wiig, who infuses Lucy with a manic competence.  Where Gru is an outdated villain who hasn't kept up with the times, Lucy is a product of a new era of empowered women who kicks open doors in heels and a skirt. This is embodied by their first encounter (played repeatedly in the trailers) where Gru loudly announces his intention to attack (""Freeze ray!"") his presumed foe by whipping out a clunky weapon; in response, Lucy pulls out a lipstick Taser and easily incapacitates Gru and then announces with a flourish: ""LIPSTICK TASER!""

Lucy recruits Gru into the AVL to stop a villain who has stolen mutagen PX-41, which turns living things into purple killing machines. He's hiding out in the Paradise Mall, so it's up to Gru and Lucy to go undercover as partners at an ice cream shop to catch the villain and find the mutagen.  The plot is surprisingly similar to ""Chuck.""

The first twenty minutes --- where Lucy recruits Gru into the AVL, Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) quits for another employer, the girls work to bring Lucy and Gru together, and the minions go missing -- are the best part. The minions are actually integral to the plot here in a way that's not entirely kid-friendly, and though ""Despicable Me 2"" works hard to defang them, the film makes it clear that monsters infected by the mutagen will eat little girls.

That's ""Despicable Me 2""'s main flaw, and it's a big one.  The bad guy, a has-been coming out of retirement, doesn't seem well-suited to the villainous plan.  The surprise twist as to Dr. Nefario's employer isn't a twist at all, and the entire film pivots on his change of heart.

SPOILER ME TOO: Or to put it another way, neither Lucy nor Gru actually does anything of substance here, it's all Dr. Nefario, who apparently didn't understand that making purple monsters that will eat the world means it will eat ""his family"" too. If anything, Nefario should have more affection for the minions than for the girls, as his relationship with the girls is never developed on screen between both films.  More galling is that super-competent Lucy is relegated to a damsel in distress, capable of taking on Gru but ushered off screen onto a rocket without even throwing a punch.

Kids won't care about this of course.  ""Despicable Me 2""'s formula has always been adult themes hidden behind a teeming mass of yellow minions to keep the kiddies entertained, and they are in full force here. There's plenty of eye-popping 3D visuals to keep the movie bumping along, and my son was sufficiently entertained by all the fart jokes (he's a five-year-old boy, the filmmakers know their audience).  But as an adult I couldn't help but feel like this was a missed opportunity.  I'll take more ""LIPSTICK TASER!"" over ""Freeze Ray!"" any day.",1373241600,18,3505,4.8458961474036855

With his unasked for partner Agent Lucy Wilde, he goes undercover in the local mall to find out who is the criminal and put an end to the evil plot.  And maybe also find someone who is perfect for him.

I watched this when it came out and I loved it, it builds on the strengths of the first movie and tweaks it enough that the story really flows.  You actually see Gru as a good parent figure, going out of his way to make sure Agnes's party is not ruined, to normal father issues like boys and Margo (that was funny).

Back in 2010, this was definitely the case, with movies like Alpha & Omega, Shrek Forever, Megamind, Guardians, etc. hitting the theater (aside from the must see movies, like Toy Story 3).  That summer, we decided to put some of our chips on Despicable Me, thanks to Steve Carell voicing the main character, Gru, and the little yellow Minions that we saw in the trailer.

Who knew that the Minions would be so damn funny?

Needless to say, Despicable Me was a huge hit, mostly on the strength of the heart of the story and the antics of the Minions.  Shortly after it's release, it was announced that there would be a sequel.  Excitement.  This followed with some teasers, a trailer, and finally, this weekend, it's here.

Despicable Me 2 takes a different direction from the first, showing Gru as a caring family man.  This time, he's recruited to help take on a new villain named Big Macho.  There aren't many surprises coming from the story here.  It's quite predicable and doesn't surprise on any beat.  The voice work is serviceable, with Carell delivering and Wiig...hanging in there.  However...is it funny?  Heck yeah it is.  The Minions DELIVER.  There are several gags which I won't spoil, but they are arguably more funny than they were in the first one.  Several scenes had us (and the entire theater) laughing out loud, including one guy who laughed the loudest that I've ever heard in a theater (honestly, it made the movie even funnier).

Bottom line...the kids will love it, and you'll probably love it too.  After the movie, it's teased that there will be a Minion movie (not a surprise, already announced), and I simply cannot wait for that.  The Minions are turning Despicable Me into one of the funniest animated franchises of all time.

4931679,4,7799444371,"In the summer of 2010, Illumination Entertainment's animated flick, Despicable Me, decimated the box office, earning $543 million - not to mention garnering praise from fans and critics alike.  A family-friendly film, Despicable Me follows Gru, an evil super villain, as he adopts three girls with hopes of using them to one-up a rival super villain.  Instead, he falls into the role of devoted father, giving up on his evil ways.  Most notably, the film also introduces the Minions - Gru's short, yellow workers that speak gibberish and often find themselves engaging in an endless amount of comical hijinks.  Now, Gru and his Minions are back, along with Agnes, Edith, and Margo in the animated sequel, Despicable Me 2.

Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud return to direct Despicable Me 2, which once again stars Steve Carrell as Gru - a now retired super-villain that's attempting to create his own brand of jelly.  At the same time, a mysterious villain has stolen a chemical recipe that can turn living things into indestructible purple killing machines.  Desperate to stop the mysterious villain, the Anti-Villain League (AVL) enlists Gru's help, pairing him with an AVL agent, Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wigg), to track down the villain and stop them before they unleash the recipe on the world.  The voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaaier, Elsie Fisher, Ken Jeong, Russell Brand, and Benjamin Bratt also star in supporting roles.

To be honest, I found Despicable Me to be so light-heartedly entertaining and enjoyable that's it's easily at the top of my animated feature list (just so you know that I'm being biased here).  With that being said, Despicable Me 2 has been one of my must-see movies all summer long...and it didn't disappoint me one bit.  As an easy target for slap-stick comedy (and I'll give you one guess who my favorite comedy trio is), the Minions are good for wholesome unadulterated laughter.  As usual, their antics and gibberish talk will have you laughing to the limit - but only if you're interested in that sort of thing.  It's easy to imagine Despicable Me being everyone's favorite animated feature, or quite honestly the animated film you'll never want to see again.  Just because The Three Stooges brand of humor is my thing doesn't mean it's going to agree with everyone's style of humor.  In fact, it's pretty easy to imagine someone describing a film of this nature as being ""dumb"" or ""pointless.""  However, if that's how you felt about the first film, I couldn't disagree with you more.

While the first film focused more on the girls and their quest to find a home to call their own (and a father to care for them), Despicable Me 2 focuses much more on the Minions.  In fact, at a short 90 minutes or so, it almost feels like the girls are absent from the film entirely.  Speaking of a reduced role, Russell Brand's character, Dr. Nefariou (although important to the film's climax) is also absent for the majority of the film.  However, that's not to say the film isn't without enjoyable characters.  Between the Minions and the plump villain in question, Eduardo Perez (originally voiced by Al Pacino, but changed to Benjamin Bratt just months before the film's release date), there's no shortage of memorable moments.  At the same time, there's love in the air throughout the film with the introduction of the ambitious Lucky Wilde, who (if you couldn't tell from the film's trailer) has a pretty memorable first meeting with Gru.

There's not a whole lot to say about this film that wasn't said about the first film.  It's a family-friendly flick that absolutely anyone can enjoy.  The animation is sharp, colorful, and pristine.  Plus, the characters will have you giggling virtually nonstop.  While I'm admittedly not a huge Steve Carrell fan, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Gru - so with that being said, this is the one exception where I would be writing someone a letter on Mr. Carrell's behalf if for some reason he was ever replaced.  Regardless, the characters are clearly catching on in popularity - especially the Minions who will be getting a movie of their own, called Minions (hitting theaters in December 2014).  And, as long as the plot is solid (which it is) and the Minions are funny (which they are), Illumination Entertainment can keep punching out as many Despicable Me films as they want.

P.S. - Make sure to stay through the credits.  The Minions will be taking auditions for their new film next year.

  Together they are undercover at the mall at a bakery to find who is turning animals into blue monsters. There Gru suspects Eduarado (Benjamin Bratt), the owner of a Mexican restaurant of being a former villain named El Macho. While someone is taking Gru's hilarious Minions!
  Gru bonding with a woman instead of the kids is smarter than just giving us a similar story all over again. While I laughed a lot and there was plenty of charm but in the end I felt it could have been a little longer since the story could have been just a bit stronger. Just like Monster University, Despicable Me 2 isn't Oscar worthy and I was really hoping it would be. In the end though, I still love Minions and want one!",1372809600,2,918,4.289017341040463
4931681,4,7799444371,"I think this film is a very cute sequel to ""Despicable Me"" and good news, the minions are in it even more. The 3D animation is wonderful in this movie and the designs and colors are very fun visually. I can tell the creators of this film paid attention to what audiences enjoyed most out of the first movie and that is what influenced a lot of ""Despicable Me 2."" I think all of the voice actors suited their characters perfectly. This film brings back the familiar voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Steve Carell and Russell Brand, while also adding in newer characters such as Lucy voiced by Kristen Wiig, Antonio voiced by Moises Arias and many others.

My favorite character is actually all of the minions. I loved them all so much in the first ""Despicable Me"" and I think it was a great decision to include them for in the sequel. Their banter is so funny, even though I can't understand their gibberish, their motions tell the story of what they're trying to communicate. I think the way they work together and fight is very comical and all of their interactions are very funny. The minions really are the perfect side kicks to Gru since he is so wacky.

My favorite scene would probably be when Gru finds out that Margo is on a date. He freaks out so much and goes running around the mall trying to stop the two of them from being alone. It's really funny and although it is a bit over exaggerated, it still shows what all fathers go through when their daughters start showing an interest in dating. I also think it's funny how Margo's sisters react to her new romantic interests. Edith, being a total tomboy, thinks that it is disgusting for her sister to go on a date with a boy. Agnes on the other hand
thinks it's the cutest thing and immediately starts saying that they are in love, which only worries Gru even more. The entire scene is filled with very funny, memorable dialog and interactions between the main characters and is definitely a scene that stands out for me.

I recommend this film for ages 6+ and anyone who enjoyed ""Despicable Me"" will absolutely love ""Despicable Me 2."" I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It has the perfect mix of humor for children and adults so it makes for an  enjoyable experience for all.
