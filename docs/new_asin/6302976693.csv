7832756,5,6302976693,This was a second time I have purchased this video after seeing the series on television.  It is a very interesting and comprehensive history of wine and my only regret was that I could not get it in DVD or Bluray format.  I loved the series and the item purchased was a gift for an individual who has just started a business that includes wine tastings and tours that I felt could also benefit from a bit of historical information.  I also ordered the book that accompanied the series for similar use...excellent service from the provider.,1462924800,,540,4.604166666666667
7832757,5,6302976693,Excellent history of the subject by *the* expert.  This really needs to come out on DVD so that people can enjoy it anew.  Even better - the series needs to be re-broadcast!,1427328000,,173,4.375

The series is hosted by Hugh Johnson, internationally famous wine expert, author, and, as it turns out, engaging raconteur. He travels the world to give us the story of wine.
In the first instalment, he visits the Caucasus mountains, where ""the cradle of wine"" quite surprisingly turns out to be Georgia. There home-made wine is still done in the traditional way, with juice, skins, stems all allowed to ferment together in earthenware jars buried in the ground. A sample is extracted with a gourd ladle. Johnson tries the foul-looking stuff. His pronouncement? It's ""got guts"". And so we're off to our flying start.
According to archaeological evidence, winemaking has been with us for at least 7000 years. The earliest depiction of wine-drinking in art is Mesopotamian and dates from 4500 years ago. There is linguistic evidence to demonstrate that Georgia is the original home of the delightful libation. All of our words for ""wine"" ultimately derive from the Georgian one.
Johnson reminds us of the story of Noah and his overindulgence, before he examines the origins of the prohibitions on wine-drinking in Islam.
In the second episode, Johnson finds the source for ancient Athenian drama in the rites of Dionysus, the wine god. Reason enough to travel to Greece and Italy.
And so the series continues. All of the episodes are as refreshing and redolent of fruit as are the first two. Hugh Johnson, over 13 episodes, circumnavigates the globe, informing us about climate, soil, the angle of slopes facing the sun, drainage, all of the factors affecting the flavour of wine. His wine tour includes California, Australia, even Japan. He often finds the time for a modest glass or two.
Towards the end of the saga, he discusses the Beaujolais Nouveau craze which was new at the time. It would be wonderful to see a sequel to this series, a 14th episode, covering the changes within the wine industry over the last 10 years. In 1988, icewine automatically implied eiswein from Germany, and it certainly does not today. Mr. Johnson would undoubtedly have many things to say and all in his relaxed and approachable fashion.
Rarely does a geography lesson go down as smoothly as Hugh Johnson's toast to the fruit of the vine. This is one of the most civilized programmes you'll see.",1026000000,17,2431,4.900485436893204
