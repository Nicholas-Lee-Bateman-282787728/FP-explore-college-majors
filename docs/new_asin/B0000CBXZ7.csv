1917931,5,B0000CBXZ7,"Yes, this show is hilarious! Each episode has a few good one liners. and you cant but help and laugh at all the people. Kim, (wish i had a job like hers, an assistant who does nothing but follow anna around), and her lawyer howard who is constantly kissing her ass. some of my favorite epsidoes are the xmas party (how can anyone forget shelley) and where they go to magic mountain.  and is nt that dog psychic amelia kinkade the one who played in all three Night of the Demons movies? Howard is just bad as Bobby about egging each other on. anna ,youre so outrageous! and so is this dvd!",1068249600,4,588,4.25
1917932,5,B0000CBXZ7,"I love this DVD set! Anna Nicole is a comedic goddess and the laughs never grow stale with this show. We first see Anna house hunting with Kimmie, Howard & Sugar Pie! It really is a hoot watching her make herself at home in each place they visit. Later we get a visit from hillbilly trash-queen, Cousin Shelly! You'll roll in the floor laughing talking about giving birth to her kid and the doctor not being able to keep his fingers to himself. After punching the OB, Shelly tells the nurse, ""what's he gonna sue me for? A food stamp?"" Too funny. Not to mention her lines like, ""I want to see her! Tell her I LOVE her!"" The Halloween Party is fun too. It also just happens to be Kimmie's birthday so Anna buys her a used VW Beetle (wish I had friends like this!) and they celebrate by puking into Howard's Dracula hat. Cousin Shelly later returns for the big Christmas Party with other such greats as Rip Taylor, WWF's Chynna and Margaret Cho attending! Everyone gets drunk and Shelly gets into a fist fight after exclaiming, ""well how do I get upstairs?!?"" You do not want to miss this. Another added plus is these DVDs are uncut & unedited. We get every cuss word, every bit of nudity and Anna being her fabulous self in all its glory!",1068076800,19,1237,4.359307359307359
1917933,5,B0000CBXZ7,"The Anna Nicole Show was lambasted by reviewers and I didn't see it lasting that long. But like the ingenius theme song says, Anna does just fine with what she's got- and that's a lot! This show is pure trashy fun and on a boring night, or any night it's fun to pop in an episode and watch as Kimmie- (the assistant) tries to pretend she doesn't want Anna's ass and Howard- (the lawyer) pretend he actually has balls and a life outside of catering to Anna's every whim and need.
The quotes you and your friends can get watching this show are endless, ""Somtimes, I like to pretend Kimmie is a bouncy ride and I drop a quarter down her shirt and she bounces me."" Oh Anna, what would we do without you???",1067990400,9,701,4.2388059701492535

1917961,3,B0000CBXZ7,"Stretched over three disks this follows Anna, her friend/lawyer Howard, her assistant Kim, Anna's son Daniel, and her dog Sugar Pie as she wanders through life after her wealthy husband has died.

She goes shopping for a place to live and has to try-out the bath tubs.  Too much time is spent on her decorator Bobby Trendy.  They go for two shows to Las Vegas and attend a male review before they go to a gentlemen's club where there is some bare skin, swearing throughout.

A doctor is brought in to deal with Sugar Pie's seperation issues. She attends a look-a-like contest where guys dress-up to look like her.  She aspires to get a driver's license.  She goes on a radio show where they are mean to her.  A cousin from Texas comes to visit, that goes badly.  She has her teeth worked on, tat work done.

She goes on a date and it concludes with a drunken Christmas party. Like watching a car crash, not really funny. Surreal. An inside look into the life of a former model, that is about it.",1396742400,3,995,4.39344262295082

1917965,5,B0000CBXZ7,"If you are a fan then there is no question about it. It is typical Anna, just like the first season it doesn't diappoint and is very entertaining. I wish the entire season was avaliable for purchase though.",1378512000,,206,4.447368421052632

1917967,5,B0000CBXZ7,This show is not the best but it is rather funny. I saw a few episodes when it aired on Cable TV. Anna Nicole Smith is simply funny on this show. Bobby Trendy adds more craziness to the mix. It's not a great show but does for a good laugh.,1372723200,,239,3.8

1917976,5,B0000CBXZ7,I had never seen any episodes before getting this in the mail so I was rather curious to find out what it was going to be like. I watched the whole thing within two days. I thought it was very funny and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to know more about anna nicole or anyone that wants a good laugh.,1317427200,,331,3.955223880597015

They are sooo funny....making fun of Bobby Trendy! ""Daniel, Hand me my Chappelles""...LOL!!!  Stern really cuts loose on here and in some moments, he makes sly remarks to Anna...which wasn't cool.  I think he was her mooching friend hanging around for her $$, but that's a whole other topic.  But he and Trendy are real characters!!!

I heard their was a Season 2 but haven't seen it on DVD.  I'd surely like to get it though!!!",1220486400,,569,4.352380952380952

1917981,5,B0000CBXZ7,"This set has the uncensored versions of all 13 first season episodes with out the bleeps and blurrs. During the first season on the Cable E! Network Anna goes on a blind date,Goes sex-toy shopping,and has the wildest christmas party in the history of Reality TV.She does all of this with her attorney,Howard K. Stern,Her Assistant,and her designer Bobby Trendy by her side. Margaret Cho,Chyna Doll,and Kathy Griffin all make apperances in this season finale 2001 Christmas party. All of us fans are still waiting for the 2nd season release.

Unfortunatly,the show's star died in February 2007. RIP Anna you'll always be loved and missed by all of your fans.",1205107200,6,657,4.972727272727273
1917982,5,B0000CBXZ7,"Of course Anna was wild and outrageous.  It was sad though to go back to when she and Daniel were alive.  Her son had a rough life.  We all knew it then but in retrospect, it came crashing down on me in full force as I watched the videos.  Her whole story is one of the strangest.  Watching her again after death just brought it all to light.",1203638400,,342,3.9705882352941178
1917983,5,B0000CBXZ7,"I loved watching this video and was sad to find that I'd finally come to the end of it.  Which is why I then went and downloaded The Anna Nicole Show Season II from [...].  I waited a couple of months to watch it in its entirety, but by then I could no longer watch Anna, Howard and Daniel, since two of the three had passed on by that time.  Sad doesn't describe the feeling, especially after getting to know all of them in such an intimate way  (and this is not too much of an exaggeration).

The video is just hilariously, ridiculously funny.  I laughed so hard I really did have tears rolling from my eyes.

One of the funniest episodes was Anna going house hunting with Howard and the Realtor.  This is the episode where she opens the fridge in one of the houses she's touring and helps herself to whatever's in there.
AND this is the one where she squeezes into the tub in that same house.

There's another episode in the Season I set in which Anna, Howard and one of their entourage are at a kinky sex toy shop.  Nothing there is lewd or controversial (e.g., no chains or bondage type ""toys""), just silly, funny odds and ends.  Anna is wildly funny in this particular segment, esp. when she is looking at the various male organs.  You just have to be there and, I promise, if you buy this video you will feel as though you are there with Anna, Howard, Daniel, Kimmy, Frank, and Le Famous Bobby Trendy.  Oh, and how could I forget the one and only Sugar Pie?

It gets a little bawdy in certain parts; for instance, the Christmas Party pushes past the line of propriety more than a little bit, but, on balance this compilation of episodes from Season I is worth it as long as you believe that some of it is just Anna being a great actress ---- and that she is.  (Thanks, Anna, for all the joy and the laughs.  It kills me to think you're gone from this earth forever.)",1201910400,2,1873,4.248587570621469

As I contimued to watch this crazy show that was on late night t.v.,
I asked my husband WHO is this Anna Nicole? My husband explained to me who she was..Now that I know, I couldn't care LESS what the woman did in her own personal life, it was her own cross to bear..I TRULY cared about what I saw when I seen her on tv, let me tell you, I really liked watching her show Anna entertained me, or I would NOT have watched her!
I felt this video showed you a side of her,one most people just don't know..Anna was very good to let those kids into her home, to just open up her personal world she lived in, just like that! I COULDNT DO THAT..And I give her credit, that was big hearted of her! OKAY we all know about her abuse of narcotics, but again I say, it was her cross to bear..I liked her, or I wouldnt have watched her..This dvd set definitely gives you an intimate look into her life...I hope more of these sets come out..I will definitely buy it..God bless you Anna and Daniel..God knows Danielynn has 2 special angels watching over her now...AND PLEASE EVERYONE remember, one day her little girl MAY be reading these comments, not to mention others who did know her & care about her, have some respect for the dead whom can not defend themselves and those who knew them, that are left behind...This IS the internet...",1189641600,2,1606,4.286184210526316

1917994,5,B0000CBXZ7,"First of all, I am sick and tired of all the slurs regarding Anna's weight gain.  The fact is, she was lovely even when obese and her unique, ditzy style came through in the series.

I don't doubt she was on some type of drug and/or alcohol, but I do NOT think Howard K. Stern showed anything but love and protection towards Anna.

Unless I am sadly mistaken, I feel that Howard K. Stern is not guilty of anything more than loving Anna to the point he catered to her every wish.

I loved the series, but wish the other seasons would be released on DVD.

I first became a fan of Anna's when she was a Playboy and Guess model.  She was breathtaking and simply gorgeous.

Then I lost track of her until this series began.  At the time, I could not access E! and therefore unfortunately could not watch the series.

O.K. -- Anna is vulgar, foul mouthed, probably doped up, and uses bad grammar.  Nobody is perfect, yet Anna let the public see her imperfect side of her in this series. In some episodes she wears little or no makeup and yes, her clothing is unbecoming.

After Anna's tragic demise, I bought the Australian edition of ""The Anna Nicole Show"" and found it to be over the top, gaudy, and just plain amusing.

The Australian version contains a bonus of Anna after her amazing weight loss, making her first public appearance as a Heatherette model.  If you can and you are a true Anna fan, you will want to purchase the Australian edition.  I bought mine here from Amazon Direct and was fortunate to obtain the Australian edition.

Yes, it is heart breaking to watch Anna and Daniel, knowing that both are now gone, but Anna and Daniel will live on, partially due to this DVD set.

My favorite episode is ""The Date"" -- it is hilarious to watch the geeky millionare paired with the ditzy blonde.  They have absolutely nothing in common and it is clear that Anna is not taken with Claude.  But poor Claude tries hard -- too hard -- to make an impression on Anna.

I also love the over the top, campy Bobby Trendy's appearances.  He even had a special theme that was used when he was a guest on the show. The parody that Howard K. Stern did of Bobby was hilarious.  The wise cracks between Howard and Bobby were funny as well.  Howard made fun of Bobby's pock marked face and Bobby made fun of Howard's nose.

I love Kim, her assistant, as well.  It is hilarious when she has a birthday party and gets a new car from Anna.  Although it is difficult to watch her puke all the way home from the Halloween party which must be close to Kimmie's birthday, this edition is still campy and fun.

I wonder what became of the darling Sugar Pie.  It was clear that Anna and Sugar Pie loved each other dearly.

The critics and some of the reviewers here panned the show, but I am so happy that E! released at least the First Season of the Anna Nicole Show because I, for one, have never placed much stock in the critics' reviews.  I have found that most of the time, the worse the critics' ratings, the more I like the productions.

And for those of you who disparage her temporary weight gain, look at YOURSELVES.  I am sick of all the comments made about her being Shamu and Bovine.

I think the negative comments made about her weight probably affected her self esteem, therefore exacerbating her drug abuse.

In closing, you do have to be a diehard Anna Nicole fan to appreciate this series.  If you hate Anna Nicole or people with weight problems, then steer clear of this series because you will find it too much to take.

But if you love Anna Nicole, sit back and enjoy the show!

AND PLEASE, E!, RELEASE THE REST OF ANNA'S SHOWS!",1175126400,20,3629,4.35618479880775
1917995,5,B0000CBXZ7,This is a great show if you are amused by Anna Nicole as many people were. I think the first season shows her at her worst in life with her weight and the beginning of fame after her modeling career began. This showed her downward spiral that lead to the Anna Nicole that we are all now mourning.,1174867200,5,296,4.120689655172414
1917996,5,B0000CBXZ7,"If you're an Anna Nicole Smith Fan, the Anna Nicole Show season 1 is a must own! It really shows Anna at her finest. It has an eating competition between Kimmie, Daniel, Howard & Anna; The infamous Bobby Trendy who designed her bedroom; Howard K. Stern dressed up as Bobby Trendy - my personal favorite; and an extra Christmas special that has Chyna Dolla, Kathy Griffin, Anna's cousin Shelly from Mexia, TX and even Anna Nicole's driving instructor from a previous episode. It even shows Anna's softer side where she invites over 30 underpriveleaged young girls into her home & went swimming with them, painted with them and just hung out with them like a normal loving person. Anna was a great and amazing beauty who died far too young. This is a great way to remember her, even though this was filmed in her heavier days, she was still comfortable in her own skin and showed how much she loved life and having fun.",1174176000,16,917,4.5636363636363635
1917997,5,B0000CBXZ7,"I was lucky enough to order the dvd from an australian seller and to my surprise it came with an Australian only exclusive bonus disc.  The bonus disc shows the more recent slimmer Anna. I highly suggest getting this version for the bigger fans of Anna. You can easily find it on ebay. You shouldn't have to worry about the regions, I have a Samsung and JVC dvd player and it plays in both without a problem. I loved this show when it was on the air. Since the sales are picking up with Season 1 E! hopefully E! will release season 2.",1174176000,4,534,4.184466019417476
1917998,1,B0000CBXZ7,This was by far the worst episode of this show. The first 10 minutes were dominated by the boring Howard and his sister Bonnie Stern......If You think Anna's cousin Shelly was a trainwreck.......check out these two together on tv....Keep these people off tv please!!!!!!!!! Talk about total trainwrecks!! However it was amusing to see Anna babysit and work at the cafe this didn't redeem the mess Howard and his repulsive sister made of the first 10 minutes...,1173830400,2,460,4.987012987012987
1917999,4,B0000CBXZ7,I had only seen Anna Nicole Smith during her Playboy years and was curious as to what she was really like. She was very beautiful even when she was overweight. I found her to be a very sad young woman who was used by men and who used men to get the things she wanted in life. I also found her to be funny even when she wasn't trying to be. Would love to watch Season Two.,1173830400,5,371,3.831168831168831

1918002,2,B0000CBXZ7,I can't stand to look too close when Anna's cousin is on the show...you have to see her to believe it! It scares me to think people like this roam the earth...This episode wasn't that funny more annoying because you just want to run screaming after seeing this *thing* on the screen. I won't spoil the episode but cousin Shelly is the biggest hick thing to hit TV....scary!,1172534400,3,373,4.5
1918003,2,B0000CBXZ7,"In this episode Anna Nicole sells off some of her artwork...which by the way reminds me of something a 3 year old would paint. It's pretty sad. . . Howard K Stern acted like a complete retard in this episode but what's new, he kinda ruined it so this isn't one of the funnier episodes.",1172534400,,285,4.2
1918004,5,B0000CBXZ7,I laughed so hard at this episode.....I had to laugh when Anna said she tried to get Shelly into modelling....if you had seen cousin Shelly in the first season....you would know why this is a total joke!! LOL!!,1172534400,2,210,4.552631578947368
1918005,5,B0000CBXZ7,"To be fair, this compilation of TV shows about the late Anna Nicole Smith is at least as interesting as ""The Osbornes"", but you'd have to be a fan in order to sit through all of this.  I guess if you saw all of the original broadcasts, then this will probably be a treasure trove of ANS that you can watch over and over again.

It's the way that Anna Nicole presents herself as a parody of herself that sets this dvd set apart from all the other video media she was ever involved with.  Some of her antics undoubtedly appeared off-kilter and laughable at the time these episodes were first broadcast. However, knowing that the subject of this series met a very tragic death, the picture is now not very humorous.

Comic Dennis Miller said that we enjoy observing celebrity train wrecks because we all have the same feelings and inclinations --- towards debauchery in general. Most of us don't act on our wildest feelings, because we're too afraid of the consequences.

However, when we observe someone who does act on these feelings, and then has to pay the resulting price, we can tell ourselves that we were correct in our assumptions. That's why the fascination.

What I'd like to know is: Why didn't ANS commission someone to design a proper fitting bra for her? She had more than enough money. Like Elaine Bennis once said about the braless Seinfeld character ""Sue Ellen Mieske"", she was ""out of control... all over the place.""

I guess it was her trademark, but why would anyone want to look like someone lugging a pair of water balloons around?  It didn't seem to bother her that she looked like the female equivalent of Rodney Dangerfield in a double knit leisure suit.

My suggestion for anyone who wants to remember ANS at her best:  Get a copy of ""The Naked Gun: 33 1/3"", and you can see that she did have other talents that she could have easily utilized. However, that was not the case. Instead, she paid too much attention to the idiot males who were paying too much attention to her.  Oh well.  C'est La Vie.

Possibly, this set might offer someone, somewhere, some clue as to what was really going on.  I would rate this dvd set as five stars because all loyal Americans should know about the cultural phenom, Anna Nicole.",1171497600,4,2238,4.548628428927681
1918006,5,B0000CBXZ7,"I am still very saddened over the death of anna nicole. I was totally shocked when I first heard the news thursday. I still can't beleive she's gone. I was one of her many fans. She was so young to die. So talented, beautiful, and full of life . For some reason I felt something bad was going to happen to Anna with the loss of her son and everything else happening in her life. I just didn't think it would be this soon. Now Anna can finally be with her son forever~*~R.I.P Anna and Daniel~*~you will be forever missed

On another note the Anna Nicole show is great. I love it. when i watch the shows it somehow makes me feel better. At the same time it's also sad watching. Now knowing they are both gone.",1171238400,10,707,4.160583941605839

VERY SMART.  Her reality show was so funny.  My favorite is when the gang went fishing, and Anna caught a little fish and whines that it was going to eat her.  Anna was funny!

I wish they'd release the rest of the shows on DVD, I would buy them immediately.  It's good mindless entertainment that will make you laugh.  Had a bad day?  Pop in this DVD and laugh your butt off!",1170979200,13,545,4.153846153846154

1918011,5,B0000CBXZ7,"Oh wow...This show is definately something to watch when you are feeling super low about yourself. This show is so horrible that it's amusing.

You'll see how Anna ultimatly squeezes herself into clothes that she shouldn't be wearing. At one point she's practically busting out of her shirt because her implants are so big. I'm not sure, but I don't think that she's aware that she's packed on a good 100 lbs., at least.

The scene where she sits in a bathtub while looking for houses and then can't get out. That's classic! Then there's a scene when she's looking at someone's house, possibly to buy, and she opens their fridge and starts eating their food! It's just funny.

Anna's assistant Kim is so obsessed with her that it's disgusting. The chick even gets a tattoo of Anna on her arm because as she says, ""I want something that'll look good down the road."" (Right, Kim.)

It seems that Anna's son, Daniel, is either:

a. Really depressed.

b. Has no personality.

c. Is ashamed that he is spawned from Anna Nicole.

d. Or all of the above.

Personally, I think her son is option ""d,"" because everytime she tries to talk to him he doesn't seem to want anything to do with her. He's always on his computer, playing video games or chatting...Anna even tries to ""baby talk"" to him, and he doesn't seem impressed.

Her lawyer, Howard K. Stern seems like the only reason he stays around Anna is for the fame and money. He tries to make it look like they're friends and all, and that he genuinly cares for her, but it's always about the money.

Bobby Trendy...I'm not sure, but I think he's Filipino. As a mestiza Filipino-American myself, I'm ashamed to even assume that we share the same culture. I wonder what his REAL name is, because BOBBY TRENDY is not a Filipino name. He is bitchy. He continuously uses the word ""fabulous"" over and over again that it makes me want to put my fist through the TV. This DVD gives you a first hand look at how Anna Nicole destroyed his designing career.

Anyway, I've been looking for a Season 2, since at the end of the DVD it says to look for it. I'm curious, but did the show even make it to a Season 2? This DVD is from 4 years ago (2002)...If there was a Season 2 wouldn't it be out already?",1153353600,23,2235,4.398058252427185
1918012,2,B0000CBXZ7,"Anna Nicole Smith... Oh, who or who allowed this to get on the air?  It's like watching a horrible car accident, you just can't take your eyes off it even though you're watching something that annoys and even disgusts you but you keep looking.  Instead of blood or body parts, we get big, beautiful Anna Nicole.

I give her credit.  She used what she had and got a lot.  What the plastic surgeon couldn't do, that dotering old man did.  Plus all those snack cakes and prescriptions.  Here we see her trials and tribulations of being a ""Merry Widow"", living with her son, lawyer, assistant and a few others drifting in and out.  Evntually the introduction of Bobby Trendy (could they have gotten anyone more gay?) and the toothless cousin from Texas brought in some drama.  But the ""hook"" for this show is both Anna Nicole's weight, her inability to dress age appropriate, her slurred speech, and her whining.  *Shudder!*  Guess you can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can't take the trailer park out of the girl.",1126137600,6,1027,4.587912087912088
1918013,3,B0000CBXZ7,"This reality show gives us a look at a C-list celebrity whose time in the spotlight has come and gone.  As she struggles to hold on to the estate left to her by her deceased husband, Anna lethargically goes through the humdrum activities of daily life... often with extreme difficulty.  Howard, Bobby Trendy, pathetic relatives, and others prove that if you've got a little money or a little fame, you'll never die alone if you don't want to.  In a way the show is a bit depressing, as the viewer debates who the biggest loser is: Anna or her hangers-on.  The bottom line, though, is that it's funny.  It's kind of hard to explain.... it's not that there are really any jokes, but whenever I see this show I can't help but laugh.  A lot.

The E! Channel wisely found some bottom-flogging low-level-waste fading celeb to build a show around and caught Anna between court appearances when she was trying to grab some dollars from her richest and deadest table dance.

It's amazing to me that there is now an entire strata of brain-dead idiot blondes whose sole talent appears to be exposing their mental retardation in front of camera.  Anna Nicole, Paris Hilton--the list goes on and on.  And, somehow, the American public not only watches these party-addled blockheads, but they can actually purchase DVDs to see them.
