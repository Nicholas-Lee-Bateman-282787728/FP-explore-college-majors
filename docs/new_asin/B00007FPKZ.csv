7976391,3,B00007FPKZ,The video was useful. The format is dated. The knowledge and it's presentation is great. A true muay thai legend Seakson.,1371340800,,121,4.809523809523809
7976392,5,B00007FPKZ,"I might as well admit right up front that I train in Krav Maga, not Muay Thai - so why am I reviewing this disc??  Primarily because I have a LOT of respect for Muay Thai as a fighting art, so I ordered the entire 4-disc set in order to complement my KM training (as well as to see how the two arts address the same situations).  To date, I've only watched the first disc, so I will confine my review to that - when I watch the others, I very well may add a review for each of those.

To begin with, Mr. Janjira's record is *genuinely* impressive - but, while watching the DVD, you don't get ANY hint of ego, or that he considers himself to be a ""master"" (whatever that term might mean).  I got the feeling that he was really an ordinary teacher/sensei trying to pass along the knowledge that he'd gotten from many, MANY hours of training/apprenticeship.  No mention whatsoever is made of any of the fights that he took part in, the focus is entirely on how to pass along the correct technique.  He starts with basic footwork, and builds from there.  I found his use of ordinary sheets of letter-sized paper as an impromptu replacement for focus mitts to be rather inspired - why spend $30-$40 on focus mitts when you can achieve the same thing with a $0.02 sheet of paper??

In addition, the entire session is filmed with good lighting (neither dim/gray/dingy nor overly bright/harsh), and virtually all of the techniques are shown from at least two angles - this includes footwork, etc.  Also - he returns at least three or four times to the alignment of feet, hips, shoulders, etc, which impressed me - without solid fundamentals, everything built afterward will be compromised!  Again - I can't stress enough how Mr. Janjira seems to be genuinely intent on simply passing along his hard-won knowledge, without including any ego.  (One note: The text on the back of the DVD's carrier states that ""he speaks in clear English..""  Well...  Yes, for the most part, but there is certainly a strong Asian influence.  Anyone who is even HALF interested in learning should be able to understand him with minimal effort.)  Toward the end of the session, Mr. Janjira displayed a technique for getting through an opponent's guard that both dropped my jaw & prompted a burst of spontaneous laughter - I am *DEFINITELY* going to keep *that* little sucker in my mental ""bag of tricks""!!

One final note - it was rather rewarding/gratifying to me to see how similarly the two arts (Krav Maga & Muay Thai) handle the basics.  From my (admittedly imperfect) vantage point, it seems to me that someone with a good grasp of the basics of *either* art would be well-positioned to make SOLID progress in either form of self defense.  I am glad that I've had the opportunity to buy & review this DVD, & I feel that both the money spent & the time taken to learn from the information contained within are both worthwhile investments.",1358380800,2,2913,4.579961464354528
7976393,3,B00007FPKZ,This DVD teaches the basics. The difference between a good fighter and a great fighter is the good fighter knows the basics and the great fighter knows the basics really well. The only reason I gave this DVD 3 stars is because it was scratched right out of the box and my DVD player had trouble playing it.,1331683200,3,306,4.293103448275862
7976394,5,B00007FPKZ,"The negative reviews of these videos are daydreaming. There are no secrets besides the little known tips of doing the basics more effectively. That's what this tape contains.

There are no secret techniques, just DETAILS that make the basics work better. If people were hoping for some kind of secret new technique, they are not going to find it here. What they will find will be some of the best exposition on Muay Thai I have ever seen in a video series.",1204848000,4,456,4.560975609756097
7976395,4,B00007FPKZ,This DVD presents the basics of Muay Thai punching and footwork. This is a great supplement to my training library. I learned a lot from this DVD.  You will need Muay Thai #2 to learn how to kick and use your knees.,1155513600,2,215,4.119047619047619
7976396,1,B00007FPKZ,This DVD contains very basic of Muay Thai punches and elbows. If you have to be learning this level of fighting on a DVD you probably shouldn't be doing this art. I fast forewarded most of it.,1154304000,,192,4.216216216216216
7976397,5,B00007FPKZ,"I have never seen a tape so well presented.  Each of the basic techniques were shown going forward and backwards to and from the camera and from left to right and back again.  Thus, you can see each technique from the front and from the side.

Mr. Janjira put a lot of effort into these lessons so even an old ""tard"" like me can learn and absorb the techniques.  He shows the basic stance and hand/arm positions and shows how to maintain them as you move around the ring.  He then demonstrates the jab, cross, uppercut and elbow techniques thrown in three variations (angles)- uppercut, horizontal and diagonally downwards.  He continually adds valuable tips during each presentation which greatly adds to understanding the movement.

There is only one negative factor - loud sounds caused interference in the video.  They must have used a cheap microphone or had the gain too high and drove their amp into saturation.  The rest of the tape was so good that I soon learned to ignore the interference.

A word to younger readers.  Fights are won with basics - not with flashy techniques.  Showboating only works in the movies.  In the streets ""flash"" will get you beaten.

Muhammed Ali only had four techniques: a left jab, a left hook, a right cross and an uppercut.  What made him better than the rest is that he did them to perfection with proper timing.

Another fighter, Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace mentions on his tape series that he only used four techniques in winning all his fights.  He had two hand and two leg techniques: a left jab, a left hook, a left side kick and a left roundhouse kick.  But, he performed them to perfection.

So, young readers, what is it going to be?  Master a few techniques and win fights or learn dozens of flashy or ""secret"" techniques and get your a** handed to you in a ""real"" fight.  But, you will look ""good"" as everyone is laughing at you when you get planted on your [...].",1101427200,23,1915,4.573529411764706
7976398,4,B00007FPKZ,"This dvd is the first in a series of 4 and contains all the basics of muay thai, from footwork to punching and elbow techniques. It is well presented and demonstrates the techniques clearly. This dvd acts well as a starting point and is excellent for beginners. More advanced students of muay thai will know most of these techniques, however it is still worth buying for the excellent presentation of techniques with the focus on correct footwork.",1083283200,12,447,4.818181818181818
7976399,1,B00007FPKZ,"This DVD only contains the most basic punches and elbow techniques.
