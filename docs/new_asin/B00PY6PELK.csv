Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0

The controversy over ""Effie Gray"" may have been more interesting than the film itself. Screenwriter Emma Thompson was accused of plagiarism by writers of two earlier versions of the Gray saga but fortunately for her, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful. Nonetheless, as a result of the litigation, Ms. Thompson engaged in no publicity junkets to publicize her film.

""Effie Gray"" is based on the true 19th century story of the young Scottish girl's marriage to the noted British art critic, John Ruskin. Effie was 19 at the time and Ruskin, 29. However, Ruskin, played by Greg Wise, is currently 48, which might give some viewers unfamiliar with the history the wrong impression that Ruskin was robbing the cradle.

Thompson ably depicts what happened between Gray and Ruskin. As a naive, inexperienced girl, Effie's dreams of wedded bliss are shattered when she comes to live with Ruskin and his parents at their London estate. Ruskin's mother is particularly critical of Effie and they both are way over protective of their son. It soon becomes clear that Ruskin has no interest in sex and actually tells his new bride that she repulses him.

Effie finds an ally in Lady Elizabeth Eastlake (played by Thompson), wife of the head of the Royal Academy of Arts, who is distressed by the repressive situation Effie faces at the Ruskin household. A trip to Venice does nothing to help the couples' floundering union, and Effie is further distressed by Ruskin's lack of attention, especially when a randy Italian, Rafael, attempts to seduce her.

The rest of this saga focuses on Effie's burgeoning melancholia and a trip up to Scotland, where Ruskin commissions a young painter, Everett Millais, to paint his portrait. Sure enough Effie falls for Millais but nothing gets consummated until Effie returns to London and is encouraged by Lady Elizabeth to sue for the annulment of the marriage on the grounds of her husband's impotence.

That's basically it folks! The story is unusual in that the villain of the piece is hardly guilty of what one might call a ""serious infraction."" But that's mainly the problem: the stakes are so low that one can hardly get excited about the goings-on here. The actors, screenwriter and cinematographer have acquitted themselves well here as this is a fine film to look at. Nonetheless, it's also a listless affair which I'm not sure was really worth telling.",1428796800,3,2452,4.951338199513382
6825454,3,B00PY6PELK,"If you don't know a lot about the backstory, or about why Ruskin was so important to 19th century art and art criticism, or about 19th century British art, the narrative may (probably will) seem very dull and leave you wondering what the big deal was. Even if you do know about all that, the screenplay is not great - a lot of Dakota Fanning's gazing out at nothing (which, actually, the real Effie did a lot of).  Doesn't make for great moviemaking.  Emma should stick more to acting.  I don't mind that she had to gloss over lots of more interesting details in Effie's story, but some of the ones she included were not only wrong, they distorted the story (e.g., the elder Mr. Ruskin was not generous financially to Effie's father - that was a point of contention in the marriage; there were more than just three people [at least initially] who went on the trip to Scotland; Effie and John did not live with his parents their entire married life - they had a sumptuous place of their own near Grosvenor Square; etc.).  Still, nice sets, clothes, scenery.",1428364800,4,1056,4.513089005235602
6825455,4,B00PY6PELK,"NOT DESIGNED AS A BRIGHT AND WITTY PERIOD PIECE --- BUT A STRANGE RELATIONSHIP CONFLICT OF A DIFFERENT PERIOD

Perhaps one of the most famous love triangles of the Victorian era, this strange tale of relationships will be slightly different than many audiences will expect.  There was fleeting criticism from some movie critics that the film was dull.  I think that is perhaps a little unfair because the film is not designed to entertain in the same way some other period films are.  I have my own mild criticisms, but they are outweighed by the reasons I thought this film was very worthy.  Though I mention the love triangle, this movie is not titillating or even that romantic in the normal sense.  For those who love period drama, there are many gorgeous artistic aspects.  But ultimately it is NOT a romance.  It is the challenge of a young Victorian woman trapped in a relationship she could never have anticipated.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  Based fairly faithfully on a true story - 19 year old Effie Gray is to become the wife of famous art critique and art historian John Ruskin (both patron and champion of the Pre-Raphaelite movement).  Ruskin was a family friend of the Grays and even wrote a famous fairy tale (or fable),  The King of the Golden River, specifically for Effie when she was just 12 years old.  As the newly wedded couple arrive at his beautiful home (which he shares with his parents) she quickly finds things very different than expected.  John is almost perversely molly-coddled by his mother and challenged by his parents' expectations for him.  The somewhat older Ruskin is repulsed by Effie's body for unexplained reasons when she, through frustration, attempts to initiate intimacy one night.  They do not consummate the relationship.  Effie finds herself no more than an ornament in a loveless marriage as she is manipulated by the parents and even bossed to some degree by the servants.  This is all just setup for the ultimate crux of the story.  She will find rare allies and also be brought into the orbit of Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais who spends time with the pair in Scotland while painting the eminent Ruskin's portrait.  Though they both recognize the developing affections, they are bound by the law and the social conventions of their age.

OTHER THOUGHTS:  The pacing of the movie may throw some off.  Nevertheless, the movie is beautiful and the trips to Venice and Scotland were highlights for me on an aesthetic basis.  However, the point of the movie is really the dilemma Effie faces.  We see very little of the illustrious life of John Ruskin, who was still brilliant despite whatever issues he may have had.  We do not even see much of Effie's later life.  This was not a problem for me because I knew what to expect going in.  I appreciated her situation and cared for the outcome.  I felt the movie handled the subject respectfully and gracefully.  Perhaps too much so.  The movie does not offer complete answers because  real life doesn't answer them either.  We still have no hard proof of the reason Ruskin suddenly felt revulsion for Effie after seeing her body.  There was some unattractive speculation, but even Ruskin never discloses this in his diaries.  She was a beauty by all accounts and the paintings I have seen were all stunning.  Nevertheless, if I had one critique of the movie it would be that it fails to delve even as deeply as it could.  Her plight does indeed seem dire and her documented health and emotional issues were depicted in the film.  Yet somehow, the movie doesn't seem as emotionally touching or immediate as it could have done.  I still consider it a great success.  The acting, cinematography, artistry, production values in general are all outstanding.  I recommend a rental first if it still sounds interesting.",1424908800,84,3823,4.802147239263804

6825522,1,B00PY6PELK,"I tried, thanks to the cast, a stellar cast, but this film is utterly horrid.  Why?  The entire plot centers around one fact: he won't sleep with her.  That's the film.  We don't know why.  We'll never know why.  The filmmakers are too frightened to guess.  So there it is, the film entire.  Dakota Fanning's face carries a more interesting expression on the dvd cover than anywhere in the film.  Seems she cannot express anything given the plot is one note repeated for almost two hours.

I love this cast except Fanning.  I thought that any one of them might redeem the film but they are given nothing to do. They each speak a few lines about the unconsummated marriage and leave.  David Suchet and Julie Walters have a few additional lines, a slight sketch of their characters (a single sketch, not two individual sketches), that's All.

Any film is worth watching if Emma Thompson is in it, surely.  Didn't she write the script?  Do Not Waste Your Money Or Time.  I now understand why no one (including Emma) promoted the film. It really is probably the worst film I've ever seen (and I've seen ""The Black Sleep"").  Ugh.",1483488000,6,1124,4.567839195979899

6825537,2,B00PY6PELK,"I didn't like it but the photography of Scotland was superb, an extra star for that.  So looking forward to Sturridge's character after being blown away by his nuanced performance as Henry the VI. But he didn't come in until far into the second half and he, like EmmaThompson, was not allowed to shine by script or direction.  His artist garret in London irked me for the filthy windows, in reality the artist would have kept them clean but that would not have given the effect needed?  This was a botched editing job, in my opinion, but maybe the script was the weakest link.",1481500800,2,576,4.519230769230769
6825538,3,B00PY6PELK,"The strengths of this movie lie in the cinematography (which gives a marvelous Pre-Raphaelite glow to the images of both people and landscapes wherever that is appropriate) and the look of the costumes and interiors, over which a lot of care has obviously been taken.  But there are some things I couldn't get over.  First of all, the writing is a bit thin -- and disappointingly so since Emma Thompson did such a good job with her screenplay for ""Sense and Sensibility.""  Effie Gray herself (Dakota Fanning) is given too little to say.  In one late scene, she tells her friend Lady Eastlake (Emma Thompson) about conversations she has had with her husband, John Ruskin (Greg Wise) that the audience has never seen dramatized.  These are conversations in which, obviously, she tasked him very directly about his lack of sexual interest in her.  Surely we need to have seen these conversations.  Was Emma Thompson unable to find a way of writing them?  Their absence makes Effie more passive and droopy than she should be, given her willingness to take action to leave the marriage and seek a divorce -- a very difficult undertaking for a woman c. 1850 in England.  But more damaging, I think, is that Dakota Fanning doesn't command the role -- she isn't interesting and she has no erotic allure that would make John Everett Millais (Tom Sturridge) plausibly enter into an intense relationship with her.  The liveliest actors on the screen are David Suchet and Julie Walters as Ruskin's parents -- truly monsters-in-law as shown here -- though their parts don't require much subtlety.  The best performance, I think, is Greg Wise's as Ruskin.  Again, he could be given more to say -- this was a man who wasn't shy about using words -- but in Wise's performance there are moments when we feel -- and it's a matter of gesture, tone , and body language -- that Ruskin is actually WANTING Effie to get out of his life.  It's not clear that he would admit that even to himself, and he is a man who values his public reputation as an art historian and critic, but Wise (whom you might remember as the dashing and rakish Willoughby in ""Sense and Sensibility"") shows a degree of complicatedness in his character that is just what is lacking in Fanning's performance.

It might not be fair, but I was a bit disappointed at the ending -- Effie heading for freedom in a coach.  In fact, it took the House of Lords to sort out the mess, which they did eventually.  I would like to have seen some of that and seen Suchet and Walters dealing with it.  It might not be fair either to suggest that the screenplay doesn't give us any reason to believe that Ruskin was a great writer and a man of considerable intellect.  In this movie, his writing is just something that gets in the way of his performing his marital duties.  How good was he?  Sample his ""The Nature of the Gothic.""",1481155200,,2864,4.589390962671906

6825541,3,B00PY6PELK,"In some respects a nicely done film. Quite a lot of people standing around silently looking deep and intense, though. Very convincing portrayal of a terrible marriage and a sadistic, self-absorbed husband. Interestingly, my experience reading John Ruskin long ago gave me the same impression. The self-pleasuring scene in the marriage bed brought the point home beautifully. Nice allusion to the possibility that Ruskin might have been a pedophile. I enjoyed the irony of Ruskin's rapturous raving about ""nature as it is"" and his repudiation of ""nature as it is"" when it was in his bedroom.

Claudia Cardinale broke my heart. I am going to pretend I didn't recognize her and return to imagining her as she was in 8 1/2 while I honor her for playing her role in this film so well. And, I always enjoy Venice. OH that was funny, too, Ruskin's ravings over how ""now"" Venice was a harlot, no longer a virgin.

Visually it should please any lover of period films.  No nudity.  Some complain it's boring because there's not enough action for them, but if you love a good character study, this will have you glued to the screen.  Mainly the odd dynamic between Ruskin and his parents.
Dakota Fanning is indeed subdued throughout but anyone who's ever had their dreams and spirit completely crushed would understand how that could happen.  I don't know if the real Effie expressed more anger/frustration but if she didn't it could have been due to the culture of that era.
The character that eventually rescues her is adorable.
Oh I guess I do have another small complaint, that there was no 'epilogue' at the end that told what happened afterward.  That Effie did get her happy ending.",1478476800,2,909,4.7215189873417724

WHY did Effie have not a trace of Scottish accent? Who made that weird choice?
The real Effie was by all accounts a strong, strapping Highland lass. In Emma Thompson's film, she is a weak, frozen tragic creature. Of course, her marriage was utterly horrible, unloving husband (unconsummated marriage), over-bearing in-laws, stifling atmosphere.
And what on earth was Emma Thompson thinking by ending the film with Effie being driven away in a coach? No courtroom drama, which would have been riviting. No being united with her true love, the painter Millais (with whom she eventually had 8 children, mind you!) That story deserves to be told. We are left as if with a cup of lukewarm tea, a bag dipped once & skim milk poured in.
Dakota Fanning is a far far better actress than one would believe from this performance.
Utterly disappointing. Emma had better stick to acting. She is quite a fine actress. But a terribly weak script writer.

6825578,3,B00PY6PELK,"Based on a true story, I usually enjoy these kind of movies. But after watching the series 'The Desperate Romantics"" starring the Poldark star, Aidan Turner (not as John Millais. Turner plays the devilish Dante Rossetti, hilariously. And Millais is playfully played as a gullible virgin, set up to seduce Ruskin's wife, Effie, by Ruskin and his mother. A much more amusing story than this dark movie. 'Effie Gray' who actually lived in a loveless, emotionally abusive relationship without the relations. Effie remained a virgin throughout her five year marriage to Ruskin. This became a scandal when she had the marriage annulled after falling in love with the painter, John Millais. There was so much left out of this movie and it was sluggish watching. I think I fell asleep in parts, not missing much. I gave it 3 stars for the scenery and its attempt at telling Effie's strange marriage. However, Dakota Fanning, (Effie) takes the part too seriously or not seriously enough. She slugs through the movie almost mute. We have no idea what she's feeling or thinking because she's basically expressionless. I don't know who has told Fanning that she can act. She can't. And since she is the main character, this poses a problem. If it weren't for the beautiful scenery, I'd give it 2 stars. Actually, I wouldn't have finished watching it. But I did and I recommend 'The Desperate Romantics.' I bought the DVD at Amazon and have watched it several times. Each time has been great entertainment.

I have no problem with slow films, I love period pieces. I cried a lot at the resignation and depression made apparent  in Effie gray's character as interpreted by Dakota fanning. I think she does an excellent job revealing grief and extreme depression while outwardly maintaining the polite and dutiful manner required to survive in that era. I loved seeing Greg Wise in another period drama where he is again the object of love and revulsion. I love Emma Thompson of course and with them both in the same film...I had to see Effie Gray. I wish they would do more films together. I wish Greg Wise would do more films, he is wonderful to watch. Although, I would love never to see those mutton chop side burns on him again...yuck, Victorian fashions for men were repulsive.
I truly enjoyed the particular scene where Emma Thompson and Dakota fanning discuss her unconsummated marriage and they are drinking tea. Both actresses did such a good job in that scene. I love Emma Thompson in scenes like that, she has such convincing hand movements and pauses. Her eyes go to the right places, here mouth seems to have difficulty in speaking such difficult words. She is the best actress. My favorite. If you love her too, you must watch and rewatch her in that scene.

 I think this story needed to be on film. Just the intrigue of the story alone makes it interesting and sad, but to have these circumstances in a prude Victorian society, then brought to film with such wonderful actors, it's a visual and thought provoking delight.
This movie spurred me to look deeper into the historical facts. It made me so happy to know that Effie had a happy marriage to Millias and that Ruskin was ever bitter.
I don't know why most people aren't more pleased with the film. Not every story worth telling is action packed or full of sex scenes... I appreciate this film and will watch it again. They did take liberties with the story siding with Effie and presenting Ruskin a complete villain, many of the facts are lost in the past and there are several takes on every story. But taking such liberties is a story writer's prerogative. Considering the conflicting opinions on the actual events, I believe this film did a good job at aiming for the facts and not over twisting the story anything way.",1472688000,2,2663,4.673773987206823

6825643,3,B00PY6PELK,"Sitting in my watch list for quite some time was Effie Gray, a movie directed and written by Emma Thompson. It is based on the true story of a young woman who married John Ruskin, a man eighteen years her senior. Ruskin (played by Greg Wise and also the husband of Emma Thompson) was a famous writer and art critic in the Victorian era who wed in 1848. Effie aka Euphemia (played by Dakota Fanning), uneducated, poor, and from Scotland, married into a family with wealth and social status. How the romance began between the two is hardly touched upon in the movie except to say they met when she was a child. Ruskin waited until she became of age to wed, and Effie blindly married the man suffering from whimsical thoughts of romance.

The movie paints the Victorian era in a rather dark, dull, and stringent environment. Effie is taken by Ruskin to live at his parents home, ruled by an over domineering and smothering mother and strict father who have given their lives to see their sons success. Effie soon learns that she has no purpose as Ruskins wife either in or out of bed. The first night they are alone when she anticipates the consummation of her marriage, she bares her nakedness before Ruskin who runs out of the room. His real life account of that moment is stated in his own words:

It may be thought strange that I could abstain from a woman who to most people was so attractive. But though her face was beautiful, her person was not formed to excite passion. On the contrary, there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked it.

What his actual objection was upon seeing his first naked female are difficult to ascertain. Effie, however, gives this account in her own words:

""He alleged various reasons, hatred to children, religious motives, a desire to preserve my beauty, and, finally this last year he told me his true reason... that he had imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was, and that the reason he did not make me his Wife was because he was disgusted with my person the first evening 10th April.""

It led to a five-year marriage that had never been consummated. Ruskin turns into an emotional brute of a man, demeaning her at every turn. The treatment only leads to her despair, loss of hair, constant illness, and overt melancholy until another man enters the scene. Unfortunately, Dakota Fanning plays a rather dull and unemotional woman who you wish would show some emotion rather than the monotone words that come out of her mouth.

John Everett Millais (Tom Sturridge, the pretty boy who played in Far From the Maddening Crowd) is an artist who travels to Scotland on holiday with Effie and Ruskin to paint his portrait. The man he admired shows his true colors during the country escape for Effies health, and Millais grows to despise Ruskin. Eventually, Effie and Millais form an attachment and fall in love but there is no sexual encounter. Its rather an unspoken and untouched recognition that they love one another. In the meantime, Effies hatred of John intensifies.

Throughout her ordeal, Effie finds a friend in Lady Elizabeth Eastlake with whom she shares the truth regarding their unconsummated marriage. With her help, Effie visits a solicitor, has a doctor confirm her virginity after examination, and files for annulment of the marriage based on impotence. The movie ends with her letting Millais know that she has left Ruskin but asks that he not come to her until she is free. In real life, Effie eventually marries Millais.

The story, though fascinating, does languish in this film. Its a slow-moving narrative, which probably only keeps the interest of die-hard period drama fans. As stated earlier, I thought the portrayal of Effie frankly painful, though Wise and Sturridge do an acceptable but not brilliant job of their characters. Costumes and scenery are enjoyable enough to transport you back into the mid-Victorian world of repressed sexuality.  On a side note, I enjoyed the soundtrack immensely.

If you are unfamiliar with who John Millais was as an artist, I suggest you do an Internet search to bring up the famous painting of Ophelia to refresh your memory. Its often used during the movie to express Effies unhappiness as if she is drowning in sadness.

It is worth the watch for the fascinating true-life account of Victorian life, even though it received less-than-stellar critical reviews.",1461974400,21,4402,4.801849405548217

6825671,4,B00PY6PELK,"EFFIE GRAY was strangely overlooked by the public despite a sterling cast enacting Emma Thompsons screenplay re-enacting the lives of the Victorians John Ruskin and is failed marriage to Effie Gray and the entry of romance between Effie and the brilliant Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais. Perhaps the primary flaw in this little beautifully photographed period piece is Director Richard Laxtons sluggish pacing of the film  It does drag on forever, unnecessarily. (Laxtons other films include Burton and Taylor, River, and An Englishman in New York).

The basis of the film is a true Victorian scandal of Effie Gray being the first woman to divorce her husband. In 1848 the 29-year-old art and architecture critic, author and painter John Ruskin (Greg Wise) married Euphemia  Effie Gray (Dakota Fanning), the beautiful 19-year-old daughter of family friends. After six increasingly unhappy years, Effie fell in love with her husband's prot&eacute;g&eacute; the famous Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais (Tom Sturridge) and set about having the marriage annulled. What reverberated then and now was that the reason given for ending the union was non-consummation. But what really snagged in the public consciousness was Ruskin's explanation of why he didn't fulfill his marital duties (was he gay, simply repulsed by the fact that Effie has pubic hair unlike the classical female figures of art, etc  questions that have not been answered). Effie struggles with Johns overbearing parents (Julie Walters and David Suchet), found solace with the prominent Eastlakes (Emma Thompson and James Fox), a doctor (Robbie Coltrane), and one Travers Twist (Derek Jacobi).

The story is interesting, the characterizations excellent, the sets and scenery and costumes brilliant, and for a period piece this film is excellent. Audiences these days are simply more mature than to be shielded form the facts of an unconsummated marriage and more emphasis could have been given to the fact the Effie was an early womens rights activist.

6825695,2,B00PY6PELK,"This remarkable tale was beautifully done and well acted.  Some editing of the facts was necessary if the story was to be condensed into a feature length film, so I didn't mind that a lot was left out.  But for it all to make sense, the screenplay really did need to follow the story to it's conclusion, because it was Effie's victory against all odds that made this historically important.  This movie follows her suffering to the point where she decides to leave her husband, but doesn't show the happiness that came to her in the years that followed.

The strange case of Effie Gray and John Ruskin is one of the most heart wrenching true stories I know of.  This movie has an interesting take on this tale, and the costumes and scenery are beautifully done.  I didn't mind the slow pacing because it is mainly about the silent, claustrophobic suffering of this unfortunate girl who found herself at the mercy of an unloving older husband and unspeakably cruel in-laws.  Dakota Fanning's portrayal of a teenaged bride who it trapped in the clutches of Victorian hypocrisy and injustice is riveting.

This would have been a 5 star movie for me, except it stopped short of the end.  Victorian laws could be utterly unjust to some women and there were those who never found a way out.  Effie Gray wasn't alone in her plight because many lives were ruined during this time period.  Effie's story is remarkable - not because of her suffering - but because she found the courage to stand up for herself and (against all odds) succeeded in escaping her horrific marriage and experiencing a second marriage that was happy and loving.  Doesn't anyone understand how absolutely RARE this outcome was????  Why was most of it left out?  I found it frustrating, that after I suffered along with her through the tortures of her union with Ruskin, the movie ends suddenly without ever allowing me to witness her ultimate victory and the happiness that she found.  It would have only taken another 10-15 minutes for a satisfying conclusion and I saw no reason to leave the viewers without a some kind of closure that would allow them to leave the theater feeling like this dreadful tale had been resolved - especially when (in real life), that happy ending actually did happen for Effie.

6825742,5,B00PY6PELK,"I don't give five stars often, or lightly. This is a wonderful period piece, based upon the true story of art critic John Ruskin and his long-suffering wife.  It's a moving, profound story about suffering and limitations and brave choices.

Production values are excellent, as is the script by the gifted Emma Thompson, who also produced the film. Every performance is good, but Dakota Fanning as Effie is really mesmerizing and excellent.  Thompson herself is, as always, a joy to watch.

If you like period pieces, this is worth every penny.",1455408000,12,543,4.934065934065934
6825743,5,B00PY6PELK,"This is a Victorian story, done so well, you almost can feel the squeeze of the corsetry, the heavy skirts, the careful expressionless face of an upper middle class woman at a formal dinner party.  After 6 years of marriage with the rich and famous John Ruskin,, Effie was still a virgin.  It was this last fact that enabled her to win an annulment and freedom to marry the much more interesting and sexy John Everett Millais.

I wonder what was in the air at this time:  Ruskin fell in love with a pre-pubescent girl (Effie);  Lewis Carroll loved little pre-pubescent Alice (but didn't marry her, probably because of her vigilant and intelligent mother), and then there is James Barrie, whose Neverland is definitely of ick.  One factor could be that the man in these stories was much wealthier than the victims' families.",1455235200,11,823,4.72027972027972

6825745,4,B00PY6PELK,"Such intolerable cruelty...I imagine there to have been more emotionally inflicted pain endured, than the sharp pangs of a stick or whip against bare skin.  Somber portrayal by Dakota, who appears to have quite the talent for playing thought provoking and poignant roles.",1454803200,,271,5.3023255813953485
6825766,4,B00PY6PELK,This was an interesting story of the plight of a young woman in a loveless marriage who had the strength to find a way out in order to live a normal life. I found this true story interesting. It was also wonderful to see Dakota Fanning as a grown up actress. She was wonderful in this film. It was also great to see Emma Thompson in the film. She has such presence.,1454716800,,365,4.083333333333333

6825769,5,B00PY6PELK,"Fantastic film, with great historical accuracy. Effie Grey, ably portrayed by Dakota Fanning, is easy to sympathize with as her unhappy marriage to John Ruskin progresses to nowhere. The situation of Victorian women--their inability to control their own lives and choose their own paths--is make clear in this film. Effie's predicament is excruciating: married to a man as cold as the stones of Venice about which he wrote, she could neither fight him nor cajole him into treating her with compassion and love. The conclusion is satisfying, and offers emotional relief to the viewer. Anyone who enjoys period pieces, and is familiar with the Pre-Raphaelites will love this film. Well-done, Emma Thompson!",1454544000,4,704,5.294642857142857
6825770,3,B00PY6PELK,"Not bad, but I was rather disappointed in the lack of conversation and character development. I really enjoy period pieces, and loved that this was a true story. The scenery, Venice and Scotland, were lovely and the acting (especially the mother-in-law) was good. However, you never truly meet Effie's parents, or see much of her childhood....just a few flashes. You really don't get to understand anything about her or Ruskin. I also thought it would be nice to have a little background on what happened to Effie after the movie ends....it was pretty abrupt...so even a paragraph about her, and her happier ending would have been nice.",1454544000,2,636,4.953271028037383
6825771,2,B00PY6PELK,"There is no background given or developed for the characters in this movie, which is curious, given Emma Thompson wrote it. Even if you research the characters for the notorious triangle, the details are so muted, that it is difficult to sympathize with Dakota Fanning in her role as Effie. There are scenes in the marriage where she simply sits there and her mother-in-law runs the household and all those who dwell in it. It might have been better if some of the household conflict was actually shown--refusing Effie a seat at the dinner table and other issues that occurred. The movie presents Robbie Coltrane as a doctor sent to treat an ailing Effie without really showing the stresses that caused her hair loss and other conditions. It is presented without adequate background, and falls flat, failing to elicit the sympathy necessary to enjoy viewing the film. She describes her marriage as wretched without showing us the wretchedness. The ending is known to history, but this film is a bad introduction to the characters.",1454371200,3,1030,4.925287356321839
6825772,3,B00PY6PELK,"I've been dying to see this movie, but why is there no Blu Ray version for US citizens?  I've heard a lot about the film and read the books that inspired it. Very interesting story, beautifully done.  Blu Ray please!  Seems silly these days not to offer up in Blu Ray such exquisite artistic films and gems like this!",1454284800,,317,4.338983050847458
6825773,4,B00PY6PELK,I really like period movies and this one was surprisingly different and entertaining; have to say somewhat slow but not too bad.  I think Dakota Fanning does a really good job and carrying the movie.,1454284800,,199,4.685714285714286

8689772,5,B00PY6PELK,Dakota Fannings portrayal of being married to a cruel man was superb. You feel her anguish as a women living in those days of being trapped and tormented in a loveless marriage.,1525478400,,177,4.5625
8689773,4,B00PY6PELK,"A very tense and restrained story, which I think must have been deliberate to communicate the social restraints the main character was subjected to.  It was really well acted, but only hints at the happy ending, instead of offering the viewer a bit more release and relief that she finds love and happiness in the end.",1524182400,,318,4.678571428571429
8689774,2,B00PY6PELK,"This story is pure fiction.  It is not even remotely based on the real situation of John Ruskin's life and marriage, and conceals the truth about the real Effie Gray.  If you enjoy watching a movie about a man's supposed impotence and a wild girls'  inability to come to terms with her older husband, then this is for you.  I gave it two stars because as a plausible story for someone else of that day and age, the movie functions and the set works.  It is just not the real John Ruskin.  It is a political/social piece designed to push an agenda that wasn't even part of the real story.  So very tired of those.  If you watch it, do the homework to find out about the real story and read Ruskin.",1522195200,,696,4.21969696969697
8689775,5,B00PY6PELK,Great movie.,1519948800,,12,5.5
8689776,4,B00PY6PELK,"This is a bizarre story involving some incredible interesting characters of 19th century Britain and yet the movie manages to be kind of, well, dull. It's an Emma Thompson screenplay, so there's nothing wrong with the screenplay, and the cinematography is gorgeous, so the movie's worth seeing.

I think you have to blame the director for this one, and maybe the casting director. Dakota Fanning is just not convincing and also not very compelling. Greg Wise looks like Ruskin, who was one of the most passionate and interesting intellectuals of the day, but he just comes off as disengaged and stuffy. Tom Sturridge as Millais is the only one who seems to have a spark of passion.

Anyway I'm sad about it. It's an incredibly interesting story that should have implications for modern day men and women. This was a missed opportunity to do something special.",1519344000,2,859,4.876712328767123
