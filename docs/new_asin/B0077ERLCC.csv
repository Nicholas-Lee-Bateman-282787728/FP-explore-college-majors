5060795,5,B0077ERLCC,"I was recently browing the foreign movie section in my local library and stumbled upon this by accident. I remember this movie caused an uproar when it was shown at the Canned film festival a few years back so I picked it up.

""Michael"" (2011 release from Austria; 96 min.) brings the chilling account of how an otherwise seemingly pleasant middle-aged insurance sales man, Michael, has done the unthinkable: he kidnapped a 10 year old boy and now keeps him locked up in the basement of his house. He lets the boy out on occasion but that's it. At a certain point Michael gets hit by a car when crossing the street, causing him to be hospitalized for days. What becomes of the boy in the meantime? At Christmas, Michael and the boy are caroling ""Holy Night"" at the Christmas tree (no, I'm not kidding). There are many other seemingly absurd moments that drive home the shocking nature of the situation. I'm not going to tell you how it all plays out, as that would simply ruin your viewing experience.

Several comments: this movie caused an uproar upon its release in Europe, yet also garnered critical praise. The initial half hour of the movie is the hardest to watch, as it is sinking in what direction this is going. And yet, I have to tell you that this is a shockingly good movie. This is the first movie directed by Austrian Markus Schleinzer, and his observations and style (with a slow-moving camera) remind me of his fellow Austrian director Michael Hanekes. And what can you say of the two main actors who play Michael and the 10 yr. old boy, just top-notch all around. Bottom line: this movie is GALAXIES away from your standard Hollywood or even indie fare. But this movie will leave an impression on you LONG after you've seen the latest Twilight or Hobbit movie.",1358208000,,1778,4.588050314465409
5060796,4,B0077ERLCC,"This is an intelligent approach to an important issue that society needs to deal with in a grown up way. I applaud the writer and director for finding a nuanced means to contributing to this conversation. Michael is an intricate and involving cinematic experience put to good use, to get the viewer to examine his own feelings towards the protagonists and ultimately themselves. It does not channel our emotions (heavy doses of hatred and desire for retribution in my case) nor give them a release but leaves us suspended until we communicate our thoughts about it in the real world, as I am doing now. I think the film will last with me for some time, it was a dark little corner of the world to visit.
I am wary of other reviews that interpret the film as concerning the suspicions of people around you, I don't think the aim is to make us paranoid, if anything to be more involved with the world and the people within it so that privacy and disinterest cannot be a de facto excuse for abuse.",1356739200,3,994,4.467032967032967
5060797,5,B0077ERLCC,"I saw this film at the 2011 Toronto Film Fest -- it was the best film I saw that year.

If you're a fan of intricate filmmaking -- like you would get in a Michael Haneke movie -- than this film is for you. Yes, the subject matter is disturbing but the director's handing of it is not at all sensational.

My only complaint is I wish the title had been released on Blu-ray.",1342224000,4,372,4.013513513513513
5060798,5,B0077ERLCC,"This very slow  moving film is about a paedophile who  keeps a captured  boy in his cellar. It is riveting,unnerving  and keeps you on the edge of your seat  .The  final scene is  unforgettable. A  minor masterpiece.",1340755200,4,216,4.648648648648648
5060799,4,B0077ERLCC,"Some films are really hard to watch.  `Michael' is one of them.  It is not an easy subject to broach, and oftentimes when it is broached it is done in one of two ways; either too distanced so as to create a void of feeling or too intimate so as to create a sense of nausea and complete discomfort.  `Michael' is one of those rare films that goes just far enough so as to completely own the subject without stepping over the line and creating something that made you feel disgusted with yourself for watching (`Mysterious Skin', while containing a stellar performance from Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is one of those movies that I felt horrible for watching).  This film hits in harsh ways, sure, but it is smart in the way it shies away from showing us too much.

`Michael' shows us a few months in the life of Michael.  Michael seems like a normal man.  He's quiet and tad reclusive.  He works hard, excels even, and carries on normal conversation with co-workers.  He functions in society like one would expect.  He even goes on vacations with friends, drinking and flirting and `hooking up'.  But, what his friends and family don't know is that when Michael returns home he is not alone.  He unlocks his basement and lets out Wolfgang, a ten-year-old boy whom he has kidnapped and who he abuses on a regular basis.  They eat together, play together and it is apparent that Michael uses Wolfgang for other things as well.

This is the story being told.  The film basically carries along without a direct end-point and we're left to wonder just where this film is taking us.  In the meantime, we are left watching some very uncomfortable scenarios play out between Michael and Wolfgang that are sure to leave a lasting impression.

What is so remarkable about `Michael' is that it really takes a step back from judgmental authorship and allows the audience to take in the situation and pass our own judgment without manipulations.  We all know how we are going to feel about this man before we start watching, but it is a breath of fresh air to have him portrayed in a way that is not so blunt.  A recent example of this would be Stanley Tucci's performance in `The Lovely Bones'.  The way that his character is portrayed is so obvious that it hurts the emotional undertones of the film.  Instead of playing a character who everyone would know is a pedophile, Michael Fuith offers us subtle glimpses of the horrors this man stirs up.  Whether it be a childish remark or a sideways glance or a flared temper, these are all traits that one could easily ignore but that add up to tell a different story.  As essential to the film as Fuith's performance is, young David Rauchenberger is possibly even more so because the way he absorbs the atrocities he faces help put a face on the crime and help derail our emotions.  His performance is beyond stellar.  This is such a difficult theme to embody, and it must have been difficult for young David to fully comprehend what he was depicting, but this young actor delivers a very convincing and well-rounded portrayal of a boy trying to survive a tumultuous life.

His line-reading of ""the knife"" alone made my stomach drop.

Markus Schleinzer is going to be a director to watch.  Before making his debut film, `Michael', he was a casting director.  His knack in that profession was seen in his key performers here, but he did more than merely cast the right actors.  The way he sculpts this film is essential to the film's development.  The way he lingers on certain scenes and the way he cuts at the right moment so as to deter us from seeing too much but allowing us to see enough takes remarkable restraint and control over his own focus.

My only quibble here is a few moments that I felt were too drug out and the ending, which I just wanted to give me a little more.  It certainly delivered the emotions needed to sell this story's completion (I was shaking, I was praying, I was crying) but when the scene cut to black I was left wishing that it had maybe three more minutes, maybe even three more seconds.

You'll know what I mean when you get there.

In the end, I feel torn here because I want to recommend this and then again, how do you recommend a film like this?  It is done in the most tasteful manner a film of this nature can be done, I think, and for that it deserves praise indeed.  It delivers all the shock and disgust without crossing that line where art becomes unnecessary.

As a side note; I will never walk with my hand on my daughter's neck again.",1340150400,6,4512,4.49079754601227
5060800,4,B0077ERLCC,"Sometimes I wonder at why I decide to watch certain films and this falls into that particular category. It is about Michael (Michael Fuith) who has kidnapped ten year old Wolfgang (David Rauchenberger), he keeps him locked in a sound proofed room with uber brilliant security in his basement. By day he is a mealy mouthed insurance sales man at a local call centre, then at night he turns into a sort of special uncle / step father to his captive. He acts like he is the father and goes through the rigours of everyday domesticity with his victim as if he were playing out a normal role, like setting the table for dinner and doing the washing up.

Poor Wolfgang is clearly traumatised by the whole thing but is sort of resigned to playing along, probably in the hope of less brutal treatment. We never get to see the actual abuse, but this is none the less powerful for it, perhaps because we are left to fill in the gaps, it appears worse, if that was actually possible. The abuse is also psychological and sometimes I felt that was actually worse than the nightly incursions. I was in a constant state of anxiety whilst watching this. However, I was hooked from the word go but I also wanted it to be over, but paradoxically when it ended I wanted to know more;  I am so hard to please.

Writer and director Markus Schleinzer has made an original and provoking film. The acting by the two main actors is brilliant especially David Rauchenberger, who was utterly convincing. Michael also watches violent porn and that gives him ideas too which though disgusting actually helped to break up the tension a couple of times. I kept thinking though that Michael was the most evil character I had ever seen on screen, which is probably not the case but it is the raw emotion of revulsion that such behaviour illicits. To have been able to get such a reaction in a film that is virtually sanitised, up to a point, is a real achievement. Whilst I can not say I loved this I do think it is a masterful piece of film making. In Austrian at just over an hour and a half, this is not one for everybody. But if you like your films to be challenging, well made, acted and engrossing then you ought o give this a try.",1339891200,10,2204,4.397058823529412
5060801,5,B0077ERLCC,I had already seen this movie streamed on Netflix and thought it was very interesting and wanted to own it.  Ordered and received in prompt fashion.  Very happy.,1403827200,,161,4.714285714285714
5060802,4,B0077ERLCC,Gripping movie and at times uncomfortable to watch .tremendous acting.  A story about the horrible consequences of mental disease and its effect on an innocent child.,1397520000,,166,5.384615384615385
5060803,1,B0077ERLCC,"This non-engaging morass seriously delivers on the downnote right to the dissappointing ending. Right when you think you might be trifley rewarded for enduring most of this plodding movie with some decent closure, the credits start roling. Well, at least it was over.",1397433600,,267,5.232558139534884
5060804,5,B0077ERLCC,"""Michael"" is about a young man who works for an insurance company and secretly keeps a little boy kidnapped and locked in his basement.  He lives near neighbors, and it is chilling to know that this very scenario could be taking place anywhere at this moment. At one point, Michael (who is the man in the story) goes out to kidnap another boy to keep the one at his house happier.  At almost every turn, Michael is almost caught.
When the child gets the flu he goes into the woods to dig a grave. Michael has several accidents and we don't know if he will make it back to his house again. An acquaintance walks in the house one day.  We want Michael to really get his punishment, which, as the entire film is full of surprising twists and turns, so is the excellent end of the movie.

The best film I've seen in a long time, it is German. I hate reading subtitles, but there is more action than talk in this movie, so there aren't all that many subtitles.  They are worth it anyway to see this excellent film.",1393286400,,1009,4.261780104712042
5060805,3,B0077ERLCC,This movie was a good movie. It has a very good plot and strong message within the movie. There needs to be more movies that send a powerful message just like this one did.,1391990400,,172,4.088235294117647

5060807,5,B0077ERLCC,Great story. Shows how the young boy goes from being compliant to rebellious. Very much like what happens to people who are abused and then one day just stand up to their abuser and use their wits to escape.,1387497600,,207,4.333333333333333

5060810,4,B0077ERLCC,"These foreigner films seem to have an edge to them. Michael is the story of an otherwise successful man, but with a dark secret hiding in a basement. It seems that in Germany there are a lot of child missing cases, and this is one. The acting is very convincing, and even though a few moments of slow pace may hunt the movie, overall it is a powerful, hard to watch film, is not an average film in any sense of the word. May not be suitable for all audiences, for some moments are more shocking than others. 3.5 Stars.",1368489600,,518,4.19

8511721,3,B0077ERLCC,"5 Stars as the movie was close to ending:
For the first 15 minutes or so, I thought this was a waste of money and that I'd hate it. The hook at the beginning was enough to keep me hooked, plus I wasn't sure if I could get a refund.  Then, as more characters, locations, and events were shown, the more I saw its depth and began to really enjoy it.

It has a lot of scenes with irony.

(I had more to say about irony, but the film ended and everything changed: This is now a 3 star review.)

I saw the end coming a mile away, but even so, I really wanted to see it. But then, just as the obligatory scene was to begin ... cut to black. No obligatory climax scene.  The movie ended with me thinking something that could only be expressed in all caps and censored words, but basically, I was really disappointed.",1462147200,,809,4.062893081761007
8511722,4,B0077ERLCC,"Michael is a film by a disciple of Haneke on the extreme subject of paedophilia. First it gets the sensationalism and repulsive aspects out of the way, by making it implicit rather than graphic: we don't see the acts of sexual abuse, more like the aftermath. In one scene Michael is seen washing his penis, no more. Michael is a boring insurance broker, given chances of promotion. His interactions with other office workers gives nothing away. He goes on an all male holiday skiing and is comically shown not keeping up with the big boys, though he does have sex with a barmaid. He also, after watching extreme porn, repeats a line from the film, after getting up from the dinner table he shares with the captive boy, Wolfgang, unzipping his flaccid penis and asks, Shall I stick this or this(the butter knife) into you? The boy,still eating, without looking up, says The knife, without the slightest fear. Its a moment that elicits a snort of amusement. When Michael goes away he leaves Wolfgang stocked up with enough food and drink. This is in the style of extremist Austrian film making, made with a cool.clinical eye. Whether this is satire or realism is hard to say, due to the Fritzl and Kampusch cases and Hanekes film The Seventh Continent.

Otherwise Michael is seen doing things with Wolfgang, like any father would do with his son, doing jig-saws, going out together, eating at table, Xmas decorations , cards, giving presents, friendly wrestling, snow fights, jolly banter, washing up. It seems Michael benefits from this more than Wolfgang does. The captive can only benefit from small freedoms and pleasures the captor offers him in an extreme situation. Wolfgang shocks Michael by depicting the two of them on an Xmas card as fully grown together with interchangeable clothes. Predicting the future situation if the present doesnt change, when hell be an adult beside Michael. Michael finds no words on the card. They are like two animals in a burrow sealed off from the world. An incursion into that burrow by a nosy female worker meets aggression as she is driven out of the garage. Michael promises to get another boy for Wolfgang to befriend, who he meets at a race track, but the boys father calls the boy back. One day Michael returns from work after arranging a party for his promotion, to have scalding water thrown over him by Wolfgang and he reacts by locking him in and going out to get medical help and crashing his car ,dying in the accident.

I see films like this as thought experiments filled with quantum realities: if he does this then this happens, if he does that then that happens. How is the boy to survive his fate or does he survive? If he is found will it be too late? Is he both alive and dead? We are not given any back story about what made Michael like this? Do weneed it and if not what new is Schleinzer showing us? Is there a need for such a film?I think there is: unpleasant subject matter and situations we all need to face and grit our teeth to experience( without emotional revulsion) without the red-top headlines and platforming repression of our thought police to tell us whats good for us. Societies and belief systems are changing all the time, distorting normal perspectives.. Michael is no ordinary Joe,though hes balding,bespectacled, calm and nice. Both actors give superb performances. This is bleak terrain, not easy to stomach.",1447459200,,3392,4.737732656514383
