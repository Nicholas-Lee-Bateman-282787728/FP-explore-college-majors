Some might like the movie, if they look at it as a dumb comedy, and try to laugh at all the stupid parts.",1504828800,,281,3.9473684210526314

881049,4,6304465084,"Olivier ""I'm-A-Cyborg"" Gruner loved the science-fiction genre more than any other action hero from the 90s, and wouldn't you know it, this infatuation occasionally paid off. Much of Gruner's sci-fi fare is a bit bland for my taste, but ""Savage"" takes every oddball chance it can and is all the more watchable for it. This weird little adventure melds strong production values with the dramatic freedom offered by the low-budget realm to create a relentlessly entertaining adventure flick that fans of both Gruner and B-movies in general will like.

The story: After his family is murdered as part of a scheme of a virtual reality tycoon (Kario Salem,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1492-Conquest-of-Paradise/dp/B000VMIILU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1492: Conquest of Paradise</a>), a farmer (Gruner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nemesis/dp/B00122M238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nemesis</a>) is inexplicably granted mysterious powers that turn him into a primitive superhuman determined to take down the mastermind.

If you have a low tolerance for absurd plot twists, overblown action, hambone acting, or just don't like B-movies, you're not going to be entertained. However, for the rest of us, I can't overemphasize how fun I found this movie. Plenty of films have the abovementioned features, but what make this one stand out are the perfect pace it has and the infectious enthusiasm of all the cast. Director Avi Nesher would go on to make acclaimed cinematic fare like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Secrets/dp/B001E2PQGG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Secrets</a>, but his skill shines through here in turning a weirdo screenplay into a pseudo superhero picture with great buildup and a surprisingly wide scope.

Of course, there are low points. Narratively, the film offers little precedent for its strangeness, so unless you're already on board by the time Olivier follows the disembodied voice of his deceased wife into the desert and becomes a caveman before receiving his powers from a shape-shifting light creature, you're probably not going to enjoy the remaining 4/5ths of the movie. Also, I think the action portions could have been done better: Gruner's character is a combination of Tarzan and Spider Man, and while there's a bit of a Hong Kong vibe to his moves there's no good karate. It's better viewed as a spectacle than a technical exhibition.

But what a spectacle it is. The storyline gets more ambitious every 15 minutes, (SPOILER) with a climax involving Atlanteans having ascended the mortal plane via virtual reality and a big techno-egg. The graphics and special effects aren't bad, given the time of the film's release. And the ending makes me hope that there'll still be a sequel, even two decades after this one's release. I'm glad that Olivier took so many chances in his career, if only for the handful of features like this that I really enjoy. Check it out!",1423094400,4,3032,5.776286353467562

881201,2,6304465084,"Where to start ... The transformation from family man to ""The Savage"" is, in a word, ridiculous. Before the bad guy could possibly know that the Savage was his ""worst nightmare,"" he (the bad guy) somehow knew.  This not quite Wolverine can leap, run, snarl and defeat heavily armed bad guy minions with his hands, which he carries in semi-claw shape throughout the movie. Should get one-star but I really try not to ""hate"" anything. I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more if Ed Wood, Jr. had written, produced and directed.
