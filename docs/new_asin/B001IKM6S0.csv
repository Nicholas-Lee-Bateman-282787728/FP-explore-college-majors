8432150,3,B001IKM6S0,"Note - This DVD is in German, and doesn't have English subtitles. But it does have a rare example of Count von Luckner's speaking voice, from the TV show ""This is Your Life"". This is almost impossible to find, which is why I bought the DVD. As a von Luckner admirer, I can appreciate the various film footage about the Count, even though I didn't understand the dialog. Be advised that you will need to make your DVD player ""region free"" to watch this. This can be easily done, just google it.",1466985600,,493,4.369565217391305
