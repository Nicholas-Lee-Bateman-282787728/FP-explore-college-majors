7994302,4,B00009XW8O,"Part of this movie is in French, but is dubbed in English, along with English dialogue in other parts.  Nonetheless, the message is loud and clear.  When you fall hopelessly in love, save some of yourself back for you!  Have some boundaries, interests, and friends of your own.  Don't immerse your life totally in the other person. Don't grovel, plead, and beg.  It only drives them further away, creating disrepect and despising of you. I know. I too was an ""Adele"" who followed the path that she did.  I was laughed at and scorned by the person I would have died for.  I cried for 8 years.  I prayed I would die. I did seek out a lot of help, however.  Now 32 years later, I wish I could have had the guts to hold my head up and tell him, ""You don't deserve me. Good luck, you 'Intestinal Outlet.'""  I never really loved anyone again except my dog.",1343952000,,850,4.289308176100629
