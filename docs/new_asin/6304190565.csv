Where is the restored ceiling?",988416000,2,106,4.631578947368421
7864098,1,6304190565,"This video is so badly filmed, like an amateur home-video, and of such poor quality that we have decided not to add it to our collection. The date of 1996 would suggest that it will discuss the recently cleaned Sistine Ceiling - the reason for us buying it - but it was obviously made before the Chapel frescoes were restored. Very disappointing!!",987638400,5,347,4.612903225806452
7864099,2,6304190565,"This video suffers from not having adequate visuals.  Though the content is good, since the ceiling has been renovated marvelously, this video is out of date.",987552000,2,158,5.076923076923077
