8456064,3,B00540ZZJM,"At a seaside town on the French coast, a series of robberies occurs. An English lord (Wilfrid Hyde White) thinks he recognizes the man who committed the robberies but he is murdered before he can make a positive identification. When his son's (Jack Watling) fiancee, a wealthy American (Phyllis Kirk), is accused of the murder, an insurance investigator (Dan O'Herlihy) sets out to prove her innocence. Based on the mystery writer John Dickson Carr's THE EMPEROR'S SNUFF BOX, the plot is too contrived and full of too many coincidences to make for a fully satisfactory murder mystery and despite the intentional red herrings, it's not all that difficult to figure out whodunit. Directed by Compton Bennett (1950's KING SOLOMON'S MINES). With Petula Clark in a non singing role as the murder victim's daughter, William Franklyn and Margaret Withers. Released in the U.S.A. under the title CITY AFTER MIDNIGHT.
