This is clearly a top-notch production from a group of very skilled people, including most of the actors. But the story, what there is of it, is lacking a sense of reality, and with that a sense of time. It's a short-ish film that feels like it could have been shorter, as many of the scenes are redundant and seem like nothing more than obstacles on the way to some sort of resolution which we all know is coming at the end. I'm not an impatient viewer, but this movie made me itchy for the ending to arrive.
All in all a top-level professional effort on a story that's just not worth it.",1529971200,,594,4.219298245614035

8656756,4,B00K87Y89E,"The ending was a little too fantastical for my taste -  but this George MacKay is a talent of the FIRST magnitude -- Jimmy Stewart, Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris and MORE.  He can emote more through facial expressions than any actor I have ever watched. Did you see his work in Outcast on BBC (which I saw on YouTube)?  Phenomenal, although it made you despise almost all of the adults!!!  It needs to be easier to get his work in the USA (Region 1 per DVD formatting, etc.)  For example, the Bypass movie is available from Amazon. UK but because my bank cards are not from the UK, I can not use them to purchase it. Isn't that more than a little ridiculous in the Internet age? Does Steve Bezos know about this???

I also highly recommend ""The Best of Men""!!! Eddie Marsan also deserves MUCH MORE screen time and play!!",1438819200,,820,4.397350993377484
