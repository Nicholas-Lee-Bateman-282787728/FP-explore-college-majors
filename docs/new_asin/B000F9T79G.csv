8119507,5,B000F9T79G,"I took a chance and bought this dvd for my granddaughter who is just starting to learn to add. She is in kindergarten.  She loved it.  But may I add... I think part of positive reaction is she loves to see kids dance, as she learns new moves from them.  It was like a dance video with some math snuck in it!",1307232000,,307,3.9193548387096775
8119508,5,B000F9T79G,"What can I say... my daughter loves it! Something about the dance and the kid-friendly hip-hop (this is probably a girl video). When my husband and I first watched the video, we thought it was a waste of money, but my daughter kept insisting that we watch it. We were sold on it, when we were driving in the car and she starting singing one of the addition songs ""one plus one, equals two... two plus one equals three..."" I don't know about you, but I don't care how she learns math...
That's when we started listening to the audio CD (included in the package)... and it really started reinforcing basic math. And even though the music was a little hokey, I've heard alot worse...

This video taught me that what appeals to my daughter may not be what appeals to me.",1259366400,,766,4.394366197183099
8119509,2,B000F9T79G,"My little girl is a big fan of Lazytown and of Julianna Rose Mauriello so I thought this would be a good DVD for her. Especially since she's just learning basic math.
I was wrong.
My daughter was quick to point out the poor production value. ""Daddy, why does it sound like that?"" ""Daddy, why are there lines buzzing through the kids?"" ""Daddy...why did it suddenly get loud?""
AWFUL sound quiality, Video that is riddled with noise and a post-production inserts of Julianna Rose Mauriello throughout the video to make it look like she was part of the production.
I can't help but feel that Mauriello was probably sorry she got involved with this one.
The math songs talk a lot about how fun math is but in most cases only share one or two siple 1+1 problems.
My daughter is the judge here: ""Daddy... this is pretty bad. Why are they doing that song again?""
Daddy and Daughter say ""Two thumbs Down.""",1254182400,,896,4.5030674846625764
8119510,1,B000F9T79G,"Awful!

Julianna appears for about 5 Minutes in this Video. And I think kids don't learn that much by watching this. (There's a 5 minute track about 1 + 1 = 2 .... come on!)

The music is boring und monotonous and the dances are idealess. (Just Juliannas dances are ok, but as I mentioned she appears for just a couple of minutes.)

If your kids like monotonous techno music with bored spoken song-texts that are called ""Hip Hop"" and really still have to learn to add and subract single numbers ... have a try.
(I know that it is spelled ""subtract"" ... but the inside of the box says, that the video will learn the kids to ""subract"" ... so I took it over so far. By the way ... if there is an orthography-video available by this publisher ... don't by it!)

If you want your kids to have fun with math, let them watch Sesame Street, they will learn more by watching this. Only if your kids are really fan of Julianna, you might have a try.",1239494400,5,939,4.2
8119511,1,B000F9T79G,I thought this product could be used for the elementary school where I work.  There was too much talking.  The students were not kept busy enough.  It was very disappointing.,1206489600,3,174,4.733333333333333
8119512,1,B000F9T79G,"The DVD has more focus on dancing and singing than math. The children in the video have so much makeup on ... why would elementary kids wear makeup? The included musical CD is a bit better, with more math problems.  The music on both is ok and the dancing is cute, if only the addition and subtraction were the main focus.",1196812800,3,322,4.278688524590164
