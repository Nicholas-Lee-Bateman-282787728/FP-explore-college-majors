2344660,5,B000A0GOQY,Always great humor and fun! This is the only TV show where we laughed hard enough to warrant buying the entire series. Waiting impatiently for the next season!,1129420800,2,159,4.714285714285714
2344661,4,B000A0GOQY,"The sixth season of ""Frasier"" marked the first time the show didn't win an Emmy for best comedy and it was probably deserved. However, it does have a number of gems and is well-worth getting for the ""Frasier"" fanatics out there.

Oddly enough, the problem episodes bracket an otherwise very good season with some priceless moments.  ""Good Grief"" is a good example of what is not right as it finds Frasier out of work (which he would be until ""Roz, A Loan"" nine episodes later) and the entire cast pushing the comedy, instead of relaxing and letting the writing do its work.  Kelsey Grammer in particular is somewhat frantic in the first few episodes and each punchline gets an unnecessary yell or emphises that works against the humor.

The really good episodes begin with ""First, Do No Harm"" featuring Teri Hatcher who completes a trifeca of comic highlights here, after her unforgetable turns in ""Night Court"" & ""Seinfeld"".  The fun continues on the Disc 2 starting with ""The Seal Who Came To Dinner"" and ""Merry Christmas, Mrs. Moskowitz"", a killer combo of classic Frasier laughs highlighted by the appropriate yell of ""JESUS!"".

Disc 3 contains the single finest moment of the season in ""Three Valentines"", a perfect, nearly wordless scene with Niles preparing for his date at Frasier's place, only to have one disaster follow another with Eddie looking on. Woody Harrelson turns in one of his best ""Woody"" performances in ""The Show Where Woody Comes Back"". The final toast at the end of the episode is both touching and appropriate.
At first, ""Decoys"" plays like last season's best farce ""The Ski Lodge"" and while it's not quite as good, it's still very funny. Niles' relationship with Maris finally ends with ""To Tell The Truth"" and has one of the best reaction shots as Niles realizes just where Maris' fortune came from.

Disc 4 takes a downturn as the focus shifts to Daphne and her relationship with Donny (Saul Rubenek).  While I admire Saul and his talents, he seems like an odd fit for Daphne and there wasn't much chemestry there to make me believe she was in love with him. An exception is the ""Dr. Nora"" episode which is rather funny although Christene Baranski does overplay her ""Dr. Laura"" impression somewhat.

Once again, we are plagued with needless previews on Disc 1 (which you can get through quickly using the chapter advance button) and no extras at all.  I suppose that Seasons 7 - 10 will be presented in the same manner, which is a real shame when compared to the ""Seinfeld"" DVDs.

Overall, Season Six turned out somewhat better than I had remembered, featuring some classic moments and big laughs.  However, the seeds of ""Frasier's"" downturn are apparent as the writing begins to suffer under the weight of the Niles/Daphne relationship which would become more problematic over the next few seasons.

Tidbits:
- Look for a young Erika Christensen (""Traffic"", ""Swimfan"") in ""Frasier's Curse"", she's in an early scene in the Cafe' Nervosa.

- A continuity blooper happens in ""The Seal Who Came To Dinner"", the lid of Niles' coffee keeps appearing and dissapearing during a scene at the Cafe' Nervosa.

- Unfortunately, there is no Lilith or Bebe this season.

- Although I didn't believe it at first, it apparently is true that Roz has no idea Niles loves Daphne until the episode ""Decoys"", halfway through the sixth season.

- ""Dinner Party"" features only the cast (no special guests or extras), a first for ""Frasier"".",1129334400,12,3447,4.835034013605442
2344662,4,B000A0GOQY,"Kelsey Grammer began his fifteenth season overall on Frasier as the hilarious and somewhat wacky psychiatrist Dr. Frasier Crane in the fall of 1998. Frasier was still in the Nielsen Top 5 during the 1998-99 season. The late Carroll O'Connor's legendary role of Archie Bunker on CBS's All In The Family and Archie Bunker's Place didn't last as long as Frasier. This same season,Grammer's Cheers co-star Ted Danson became the star of the new CBS sitcom,Becker. Danson's character is in the health care field as well.",1128384000,,514,4.988372093023256
2344663,3,B000A0GOQY,"I'm a big Frasier fan.  However, I do feel the series fell off its high standards (as one of the greatest TV shows ever) by Season Six becoming, to me, a very contrived show.  During Seasons one through five nothing, on television, was (to me) any funnier than the sitcom of Frasier.  But, I'm afraid, by its Season Six (to me) things seemed to deteriorate with situations becoming forced in order to just get a laugh.  The characters were still wonderful; however, the situations and circumstances they were put in seemed, to me, to be obviously ""set-up"" for the laugh.  During seasons 1-5, I never got the aforesaid feeling; those seasons were just consistently hysterical.  In Season Six there are certainly some laughs to be had; nevertheless, the laughter, for me, was not as consistent as in the previous seasons.

In light of the above, this will be the last season of this great series that I will purchase on DVD.  I truly feel that the series should have ended at Season Five.",1127174400,15,986,4.658959537572255
2344664,5,B000A0GOQY,Classic Frasier...if you love Frasier then this season is sure to please. The first 5 seasons won the emmy for best comedy series and this one should have been number 6.,1124841600,2,169,4.483870967741935
2344665,5,B000A0GOQY,"I have been waiting for Season 6 to be released for years! It has 2 of the funniest episodes:  ""Two Valentines"" where Niles does a slapstick bit setting Frasier's apartment on fire while ironing; and ""The Seal Who Came To Dinner"" where Niles breaks into his soon-to-be-ex-wife's beach house to throw a dinner party and a dead seal has washed up onto the beach.  Both episodes will have you laughing out loud!!  Season 6 also includes Niles having to move into The Montana which is hilarious! I plan to own the entire collection when it will (hopefully) be offered in the future, but I am definitely purchasing Season 6 now as it is one of the best!",1124236800,11,648,4.521367521367521
2344666,5,B000A0GOQY,"Season 6 was really the end of an era, before the Daphne-Niles romance became more than a one-sided infatuation and, although it provided emotional gratification to the show's fans, it sapped some of the show's energy. Bulldog was also soon to become a bit-player on the show, too--I'm not sure why. In addition, Frasier was shut out of the Emmys for the first time ever (it was defeated by Ally McBeal). At least we can be thankful that David E. Kelley wasn't involved with Frasier, or things would have detioratated much faster. Frasier, at least, ended strong last year.

The sixth season had more than a few laughs. Initially, Frasier was unemployed after KACL converted to a Latino-music station. One particularly funny episode was ""Frasier's Curse"", which had the unemployed Frasier trying to strike an upbeat note while awaiting a high school reunion. Frasier eventually does get his job back (sadly, Bulldog doesn't). Another highlight is a visit from Cheers' dense bartender Woody, which serves as a reminder of where Frasier actually began. ""IQ"" has Niles and Frasier settling the score on which one is smarter, but the best episode of this season is ""Dinner Party."" In this real-time episode, Frasier and Niles decide to throw a dinner party, but the planning goes awry when one of the guests makes a disparaging remark about one of the brothers. It's very clever, although it doesn't exactly take advantage of the entire ensemble.

Ultimately, this is a happier season than the last one, but it has the usual quandries and issues for Frasier and his family and friends (and we wouldn't have it any other way). This is still the show on the top of its game, before the 7-8-9 seasons' gradual erosion and the last two seasons' remarkable recovery. A worthy buy.",1122336000,78,1771,4.880398671096345
2344667,5,B000A0GOQY,"Season 6 has some hilarious, unforgettable situations Frasier, family and his friends have to work through.  In ""The Seal Who Came To Dinner"" Frasier & Niles seek approval from snob hill, only to have a dead seal ruin their chances for the Golden Apron.  Niles moves to Shangri-La,...the apartment with folding bed and reach-in closet.  Donny Douglas, Daphne's husband-to-be-NOT is introduced.  Niles tries to break them up, but fails for the next 4 seasons.  And then there's Faye,...or is it Cassandra?  Frasier couldn't get it right.

2344670,5,B000A0GOQY,"Fabulous!  What can one say about Frasier.  It keeps getting better, season after season.  This sitcom is a must see for all that love well structured, intelligent comedy.  It never gets old...  New television comedy writers should take note and learn from this show.  From what I've viewed, recently, the ""comedy"" consists of low-brow humor, that is comprised of one topic... How can we make the viewer cringe with our sex jokes.  That gets old quickly...  Frasier, managed to make their jokes; avoid cringe worthy moments; and give the viewer a genuine belly laugh.  This show will pass the test of time... Staying enjoyably funny and relevant.  :)  *This review applies to all seasons*",1486598400,2,688,4.947368421052632

2345187,5,B000A0GOQY,"Frasier is one of the rare shows that remains funny and smart even 10, 12 and more years later. The writing is intelligent, the chemistry between the cast is palpable, the humor never relies on lazy vulgarity or violence, and there is always a sense of both the urbane oneophile and the Lazboy beer drinker in every episode. Season six saw Daphne engaged to Donnie and Niles aghast from afar. Frasier couldn't keep his two girlfriends straight in his head and runs in circles. Roz and Bulldog lose their minds briefly... A good season.",1444348800,,535,4.702127659574468

Discs arrive in plastic sealed box, inside that is actual disk box that holds the disks to keep them locked in place and scratch free. Of course in order to keep up with the series you will become a little confused if you skip around the entire set the first time. Each show leads a small clue as the next show and so on, until the surprise ending.
By the way if you like dogs you will love ""Eddie"", one of the main but unpredictable actors in the show. Just for note: There were really two ""Eddie"" dogs in the show, the older dog which played on the first 1/2 of the series and then his pup, that played the second 1/2 of the series",1425686400,,679,4.074626865671642

He is a a psychiatric trainwreck. Overly emotional he submits, not only to his own egotistical feelings, but is led by the female characters he pursues. Opposed to Roz, a man in a woman's body, Frasier is trapped within his feminine emotional characteristics. He is the proverbial blonde.",1402531200,,444,4.842105263157895

2345966,5,B000A0GOQY,"If you enjoy witty banter and subtle (or not so subtle) jabs, you will be be thoroughly amused by the characters of Frasier. The situations that evolve over a mis-understanding can be hilarious in how they play out. Good entertainment.",1388016000,,235,4.9
2345967,5,B000A0GOQY,It  just gets better like a fine wine.. the cork is let off the bottle at the end with Niles and Daphne.

I  appreciate the series more now then when it was on the air.,1387238400,,325,4.5
2345968,5,B000A0GOQY,"Frasier is consistently well  written and well performed. Everyone knows their parts and they live their parts. Meaning they own it. In the whole series there are less than five episodes that I find a bit below their standards but the rest are top notch and hard to match. Anyone who loved his character on cheers will love watching the evolution of the character on this series. 11 seasons hardly seem enough. This is my second time buying this set, as the new sets have a single dvd case (hard case) and it fits on my shelf better and is well protected. It's definitely a series worth keeping and sharing.",1387152000,,607,4.5181818181818185

2345972,5,B000A0GOQY,"I have been catching up with this show, which I never watched on TV, on Amazon Prime....the character development, the as of yet unrequited love of Niles for Daphne, the way Frasier always manages to bungle things despite his grandiose intentions are just  marvelous...Roz, Bulldog, Martin  and Eddie are great characters in their own right and all are FUNNY....

My only complaint is that I often go to work tired because I insist on just ""one more episode"" before I go to sleep...",1383436800,,482,4.783132530120482

2345985,5,B000A0GOQY,Perhaps there are less sitcoms offered on networks now because the past was quite sophisticated humor. I consider Frasier to be one of the classics up there with Seinfeld.,1382400000,,171,4.931034482758621

2345989,2,B000A0GOQY,"Make no mistake, I love the Frasier series, but the DVD's that I received are not  good copies.  All of the episodes do not play.  There is much pixilating that will not allow me to view the episodes.  I have tried different DVD players with the same results.  I may have to purchase another sixth series.",1380844800,,305,4.375
2345990,5,B000A0GOQY,"I love Frasier, what can I say? I am glad I bought this DVD. If you're a Frasier fan and can't afford a package of the whole series at once, do as I did, buy one season at a time as your budget allows. I have to say this was probably the last of the Best of Frasier.  After 911 and the loss of David Angell, Frasier was angrier and not the same character after 2001.  He was always angry and would have tantrums and screaming fits about everything.  The whole cast in fact had a lot more angry moments then they did funny moments and the ""comedy"" was gone.  They probably should have wrapped it up in 2001, because it never did come back as a comedy.  I am surprised it stayed on as long as it did after David Angell died.  I wanted the whole set, so one by one I did buy them, in hopes to complete my set, but also in hopes that it would return to the comedy it had been.  It never really did though.  A shame to end up where it did.  When I re-watch I probably will only go up to Season 6 and then just skip to the last few episodes in Season 11.  I will certainly skip over many from Season 6's end through Season 11.  I understand why the mood changed so, but they shouldn't have kept going.",1379376000,2,1195,3.9581589958158996

In episode one everyone dons new hairstyles and Frasier gains a lot of pounds in an episode that redefines `denial' but episode two fails miserably; Frasier overacts and the comedy is ridiculously broad! I don't know what the writers are thinking on this show sometimes; they set up some funny moments and then go too far in a very awkward manner and added to it is an unresolved and strange end to the episode ; this ain't no Will And Grace!  `Hot Ticket' is another example of this; pompous, overdone and yet another attempt at a classic Frasier misunderstanding. The highlights are; Three Valentines, Roz a Loan, Secret Admirer, Merry Christmas Mrs. Moskowitz, The Good Samaritan, When A Man Loves Two Women, Maris`Divorce and the final two charming episodes save the season!",1280707200,,849,4.895833333333333

2346218,5,B000A0GOQY,"Season six offers so many laughs and highlights Niles (David Hyde Pierce) so well, playing up his best qualities, that it must qualify as the funniest season of Frasier.  The writers never give up on character development, as Niles grapples with missed opportunities and Frasier deals with a variety of relationship issues, especially those outside the romantic realm.  This season, of course, also has what is known as one of the ""funniest four minutes"" on television, with the scene where Niles irons a pair of pants, resulting in slapstick comedy that makes me laugh so hard I cry, every time I see it.",1231632000,,605,4.864077669902913

This volume has plenty of choice moments, including the uproarious episode, ""Merry Christmas, Mrs. Moskowitz."" David Hyde-Pierce proves himself to be one of television's all-time great physical comedians, and John Mahoney is never to be discounted in any genre. I now own two seasons of ""Frasier""; I plan to have all of them.",1202169600,,483,5.205128205128205
2346247,4,B000A0GOQY,"Few shows share the great wit and comedy that Frasier offered during its run on NBC. A brilliant cast came together with some very gifted writers, and they made magic.
Season 6 has its gems (and its clunkers) as any show does. But as I say, even a Frasier clunker is better than most other television programs.

For me the low point of season six was the dubious addition of the unlikeable Donnie Douglas character and his preposterous romance with Daphne. It is completely unrealistic that a pretty, charming woman like this would be attracted to a gnarled little troll (a very flabby one at that) who looks like he's had a stroke. Why they even cast this person is beyond my comprehension. I couldn't wait for this story arc to end.

Season 6 does offer some delicious episodes.
""How to Bury a Millionaire"" is one of my favorite Frasier episodes ever. The simple idea of Niles having to live with Frasier temporarily is gold. The scene where they try to sleep in the same room is fantastic. Then, in the same episode, we see Niles' horrified reaction to the Shangri La apartment complex where he will have to live.
Great stuff.
""Dial M for Martin"" is terrific, as is ""The Seal Who Came to Dinner"" and ""Three Valentines"" (which features Niles' best physical comedy scene ever).

I love watching this program, and it is very rewatchable on dvd. Sure, the special features are awfully paltry, but I forgive this simply because it's Frasier. Being able to have the dvd's and watch this classy, hilarious show any time is a true pleasure.",1201737600,4,1535,4.636029411764706

Well worth the investment, new or used if you a fan of Frasier.

And it is fun to watch in sequence, season by season, to see the development of the characters and the progression of their ups and downs as they are meant to be seen.

2346292,5,B000A0GOQY,"I don't know about you but TV is getting worse and worse. It is hard to find a series to watch consistantly as a family. That's why my wife and I have started to purchase series we loved as kids and later as adults. Frasier is one of those series that we have chosen. Originally I feigned their purchase, knowing that the sexual standards were low and at times the characters were involvled in sexual banter, having re-rented a few of the shows, we decided to go ahead and purchase one season at a time. As we watched season by season, our kids became hooked. We have laughed as a family more during these shows than at any other sitcom to date. We have had to edit the sleezy parts and really wished they had not had people in and out of each other's beds, but if you can get past these things, then you will find Fraiser to be a great show. Season Six is especially funny. Niles is the real gem of the show, though the father-son and brother-brother dynamics adds depth and opportunities for series family talks on important matters. We use all films not only for entertainment but to produce family discussions on a variety of issues. We teach our kids our values and ethics, faith and love, rules and grace, and how to get along with others in this world. Fraiser can also be used as a god discussion starter that allows you to pass on your values in a natural, non-preachy, way.",1151280000,6,1383,4.364341085271318

THE ONE WHERE WOODY TURNS UP

The kind but dim-witted barman from 'Cheers', Woody Boyd, stops by to catch up with former regular Frasier Crane. They have a great time reminiscing but meeting again and again, Frasier realises they have nothing else in common....

The highlight of this series is watching the various ups and downs that Niles faces...usually painful, sometimes heartbreaking but on the whole hilarious.  David Hyde Pierce steals the show in this series.  He is even more endearing than ever, especially in the episode ''Visions Of Daphne''.

The only downside of this series is that Bebe doesn't have an appearance.

Can't wait for Series 7...",1130112000,2,675,5.090909090909091
