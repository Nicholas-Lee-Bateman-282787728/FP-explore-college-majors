4707303,3,B005HZG6SS,"Most of the songs are winners but I didn't care for some of the videos.  About half of the videos were animated.  The animation is on par with silly flash videos that are all over the internet so I wasn't too impressed by any of them.  I also though the video quality of White & Nerdy wasn't very good which was quite disappointing since that is one of my favorites.  The videos with Al in them are very good, I was just disappointed because I thought he was going to be in all the videos.  Overall I did enjoy this and I'm glad I bought it as I'm sure I'll watch it again.",1322784000,8,573,4.035398230088496
4707304,5,B005HZG6SS,"Just a quick review.

I purchased this, as although I have the CD/DVD combo of this album, I really wanted the videos in HD.

This is a Video Album of the newest Al release, and should not be confused with either of the previously available LIVE DVD (or Blu-Ray)

I shall be honest, the biggest bonus for me on this disc, is ""White and Nerdy"" which was the hit song from Al's previous studio album, ""Straight Outta Lynwood"". Finally I can enjoy this in the best way possible.

Going back to this disc, Al has amazingly produced videos for each track of this release, and not many people do that these days, if at all. This to me is outstanding, and there is something on this disc to entertain every Al fan (and a few non Al fans)

Oh, and a final comment on the Live show debate - I am a fan based in the UK - I managed to see him live in 2010 in London. It was an amazing show, almost every song had a costume change, the medley is great fun and Al and the band really put their all into it. The concert DVDs do not do the show true justice",1320710400,17,1042,4.038834951456311
4707305,5,B005HZG6SS,"Firstly, why is someone reviewing a live dvd, when they should be reviewing THIS dvd/bluray? I love weird al videos, so I am going to purchase this one. But, I am also writing in response to a previous review of the live dvd. A lot of artists do medleys of their hits. It's nothing new. Of course I'd rather see him do the whole song as opposed to a medley. But the concert was about an hour and a half, so that's not bad. I like the performances he did do, so I am not going to hate on what he didn't do. That's my biggest issues with reviewers. Do not harp on what's not there, tell us about what IS there. I do appreciate Al including music videos that did not come out with the orignal ""Straight outta Lynnwood"" DVD that came with the album. As the album included videos for everything but the main collection of songs and parodies but the newere ones (as al usually does the parodies last, so as to remain current) such as white and nerdy and trapped in a drive thru came out after the deluxe cd. So I am glad he included them with this dvd. The only way this dvd could be better is if they included videos from both albums. so that way you can have all related videos for the last two releases. Again, I loved the live DVD so purchase that too. And this one won't disappoint either. The extra video of White and Nerdy is awesome anytime you can see weird al together with donny osmond, is a plus. Al's videos are definitely worth getting because they get better upon repeat viewings, you can always find something you missed the first time.",1320624000,6,1546,4.244067796610169
4707306,3,B005HZG6SS,"As a Weird Al fan who lives in an area where Al rarely tours, I thought it'd be great to get the Alpocalypse Live DVD (Yeah, I didn't get the Blu-ray, but apparently Amazon doesn't sell the DVD.  Well, if this is an example of how Al does his concerts, I'm not going to go to one anyway.  For one, while the songs that were performed, were done well, there were a LOT of songs that there were only part of the song done, and I hate that.  For Example, ""Rye or the Kaiser"", ""I Want A New Duck"", ""E-Bay"" and others were all either a verse, sometimes two, then right into the next song.  I'm perfectly willing to drop my money on an Al album, but if this is how he does his concerts, I'll save my money.",1319414400,,700,4.014388489208633
8474024,5,B005HZG6SS,"What's not to love about Weird Al?! This is a great collection of videos to complement the album ""Alpocalypse"".  No complaints from this Weird Al fan! (I hope a similar Blu-Ray release comes out for the videos from his most recent album, ""Mandatory Fun"".)",1480204800,,255,4.795454545454546
8474025,5,B005HZG6SS,"I already owned the Alpocalypse DVD included in the Alpocolypse deluxe CD & DVD set, and the ""Weird Al"" Yankovic Live! - The Alpocalypse Tour DVD, but since I recently bought a Blu-Ray player, I thought it would be nice to have the music videos on Blu-Ray.

The Blu-Ray includes two Alpocolyse videos not on the DVD, Perform This Way and Polka Face. These are visible in the back ground in the Alpoclyse Tour DVD, and when I caught the Mandatory Tour in Milwaukee, they were included in the lineup, but the Blu-Ray version includes some shots I'm pretty sure I hadn't seen before.

It also includes 3 bonus videos from Straight Outta Lynwood that are not on the DVD side of The Straight Outta Lynwood disc.

Al takes full advantage of Blu-Ray's higher resolution to fill the screen with detail. I found myself pausing the disc frequently for a better look. For example, you can actually read the fine print on the coupons that flash across the screen in Whatever You Like.",1464048000,,972,4.606936416184971

8474028,3,B005HZG6SS,"I am a huge fan of ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, and his videos rarely, if ever, disappoint.  The content of this disc is fantastic, and the fact that it contains the video for ""White & Nerdy"" is a huge selling point for me.  That being said, not all of these videos were actually produced/mastered in high definition.  Some have been upscaled for this release, causing certain videos to look less clear than others.

It is not difficult to determine with a quick, thoughtful glance which videos are native to the 1080p format, which ones have been upscaled from 720p, and which are simply 480p standard definition videos upscaled for blu-ray.  Here's what I determined:

The following videos were produced in 1080p, and look perfect on this release:
 Perform This Way
 TMZ
 Skipper Dan
 Polka Face
 Party In The CIA
 If That Isn't Love
 Whatever You Like
 Stop Forwarding That Crap To Me

The following videos were apparently produced in 720p HD and upscaled to 1080p, resulting in a less crisp/clear image:
 CNR
 Craigslist
 Ringtone
 Another Tattoo
 White & Nerdy
 Trapped In The Drive-Thru

which leaves just one video - ""Do I Creep You Out""  This video was clearly not produced in high definition and looks absolutely terrible as a result of the upscaling from 480p.  To make matters worse the video was de-interlaced (rather than de-telecine'd) before being upscaled.  And yet, sadly, it's still the best quality version of the video I've found.  (The iTunes and YouTube versions are both lower than 480p resolution, so they are of even poorer quality than the source material for this upscaled release.)

In all honesty, I would have preferred that the folks in charge of mastering this blu-ray had simply put each video on the disc in its native resolution (not to mention, frame rate) and left the upscaling to the blu-ray players themselves.  This would have provided the best experience for the viewer, and it would have likely saved production time/cost as well.

All that being said, I still think this blu-ray is worth buying.  Not only do I personally hope that purchasing this release could lead to future HD releases of Al's videos for sale, but I think any true ""Weird Al"" fan would want to own his videos in the best format available.",1408060800,4,2244,4.798429319371728
8474029,5,B005HZG6SS,"For the first time Weird Al has released music videos for every single track on his latest album, Alpocalypse.  This blu-ray features all 12 music videos plus a few more from his previous album.",1362960000,,194,4.705882352941177
8474030,2,B005HZG6SS,"Most of the videos are simply duds.  Only a few are worth a repeat viewing.  But, of course, that's all a matter of taste.

I think most people will be happy just because of ""White and Nerdy"".",1360368000,,192,4.135135135135135
8474031,5,B005HZG6SS,"I saw al last year and he was brilliant in concert as usual. This isn't a live show but his videos for his latest release , few comedic musicians have been able to maintain a career much less be at the top of their game for 30 years but al does it. And he does it here too in hd. The best videos are the ones that he is in and not the animated ones but I was glad to grab this one.  So if you like good musical parody tunes done with alot of talent then this one is for you.",1338163200,,474,3.6470588235294117
