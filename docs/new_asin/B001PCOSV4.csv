3747152,5,B001PCOSV4,"This movie had a low budget, which is stated in the special features on  the DVD itself, and it does suffer from this.  But they did a good job pulling it together and it is better than most low budget movies.  The story is sound, the actors are ok and did there job well.  The photography is nicely done, it is not epic, but it is good.  The special effects are very well done, modern CGI for the dragons.

The story itself is a simple one, very much like the Star Wars movie, a farm boy is raised not knowing he is the chosen one who is suddenly thrust into an adventure.  One of the cut scenes in the special features on the DVD had the boy complaining to grandfather about not being able to go work in the mines that all of his friends had already started working there.  That would have been to much of a copy of Star Wars, good that they removed it.  Other scenes that they cut I wished that they left in, it would have made the movie flow better, that is to say easier to understand the story.

The basic story is that the boy's caretaker, i.e. grandfather, undertook the quest himself and came near the end and failed.  So he raised the boy and schooled him in the values need to complete the quest.  However before the boy is fully trained the dragon is released and the boy has to begin the quest early.  What is the quest?  Well in the land there was a group of monks who were knights and had keep the land in a state of harmony, until one of the monks turned bad and drew power from the dark forces, creating a dragon.  So the boys quest and the quest that grandfather had failed at? It is to collect the seven stones of virtue and call a good dragon to battle the evil one.  The boy must learn the virtues of prudence, justice, restraint, fortitude, faith, hope and love.  If this sounds to Christian to some of you I might point out that the seven virtues come from Plato and Aristotle and were only adopted by early church fathers (they do not come from the Bible, what is in the Bible is the fruit of the Spirit and does over lap in some cases with the seven virtues).

But it is a good story and well worth buying the DVD for to watch.  The DVD cover states ""Destined to be a fantasy adventure classic in the tradition of Lord of the Rings and Chronicles of Narnia""  A big claim, we will see if it comes to pass.",1241481600,4,2329,4.133333333333334

3747203,3,B001PCOSV4,"Never really felt like the main character was really tested to earn the stones and part could be the fact the movie time frame does not allow for real dept considering there were like seven stones he had to earn. Plus the intro of characters and the final battle. This would have been better as a 10 to 12 episode.

There were some dragons in it but only in the background of the store.  The title after all is Dragon Quest and you would think it would have a little more to do with dragons.

Special effects were ok and for the most part so was the acting with the exception of a few characters. Especially the one character that was known to everyone as ""grandfather.""  Which you would think they could have least come up with a half decent name for him.

The song that was played during the ending credits has a decent beat to it.

3747204,3,B001PCOSV4,"This ""Lord of the rings"" rip-off by mockbuster master The Asylum is a lot better than it deserves to be.

Unlikely named actor Daniel Bonjour, obviously cast because he looks a lot like Frodo, plays Arkadi, a youthful adventurer who must collect a number of jewels which, when placed into an amulet that looks like it was bought at Claire's Boutique for $10.95, will for unexplained reasons give him the power to save the world from the evil of a wizard named Kirill, played by Not Ron Perlman, and his CGI dragon.

He's aided in his quest by two warriors: Katya, whose porn star makeup and lip gloss perfectly match her porn star acting talents, and Maxim, played by ungracefully aging Marc ""Beastmaster"" Singer, whom the director unwisely required to act like the child of an unholy union between Yoda and Popeye.

Between the opening scenes of Not Frodo peeping at a hottie villager taking her clothes off for no good reason (Note: You don't even get a peek; don't even bother pausing or backtracking the DVD like I did) and the anticlimactic final battle between Not Frodo and Not Ron Perlman, there's in fact a charming little fantasy story going on, with some pretty location shooting and nice b-roll over mountain vistas and lush forests.

The dragons are actually pretty neat looking, even though all they really do is fly around and shake their heads back and forth. And the scene with the Giant Spider Which Does Nothing is worth the Netflix order alone.

All in all, ""Dragonquest"" comes off as a bunch of renfaire friends who got together and made their own fantasy movie, with some bargain basement CGI spliced in. On that level, it's a pleasant enough bit of fun.

Don't buy this one for full price; that would just be foolish. But I've seen it here on Amazon for about three bucks new, paired on the same DVD with the equally workmanlike Asylum effort ""Merlin: War of the Dragons."" That's how to buy your bad movies, folks. Get 'em cheap, watch 'em once, then sell 'em for a profit at your next garage sale.

""Dragonquest"" isn't worth anything more than that, and once more, it doesn't aspire to be.",1330819200,8,2113,4.648793565683646
3747205,2,B001PCOSV4,"The plot is an adaptation of ""Star Wars"" (Hans and Princess Leia combined into one character), for a middle earth movie complete with bad dragons, a quirky Yoda-like instructor, and a boy who must be taught, who isn't ready. The acting is bad. The dragon, fight scenes, and blood are all CG effects, and not very good ones at that. The movie certainly has some MST, it might be funny if stoned quality to it. But for the normal sober viewer this is a big time avoid.

In the beginning our horn-dog hero is spying on a young topless girl, then later he won't get into a bath tub with a major league babe. The movie has some gem lines: ""You may call me...Stranger."" or ""You must continue along this route until...you find shelter.""

No F-bombs, no sex, was that brief teaser nudity in the beginning?",1328832000,,797,4.4520547945205475
3747206,4,B001PCOSV4,"The Asylum is a film company best known for making low-budget affairs. Like Full Moon Films, most movies are filmed on location in countries and whatnot where pretty much the movies take place. For the most part, their movies are enjoyable. However, unlike Full Moon, instead of putting out movies based on original properties- they've earned a reputation of making their 'version' of others films. Course, if anyone cared to look, they have alot more original films to their credit than people realize. Thankfully, this collection is of the latter.

Merlin & The War of the Dragons is a movie loosely based on the legends of King Arthur and Merlin. Whereas Dragonquest is about an evil wizard, wishing to conquer the world for his own, unleashes a dragon onto the world to terrorize the peasant folk into submission. A small resistance has formed to defeat him utilizing the strength of a dragon believed to be the only creature in the land that can match the fire dragon in strength, and so the vigilantes set out in their quest for the dragon to save the kingdom.

Both movies are pretty decent efforts, in my opinion. If I had to pick a favorite out of the two, it would have to be Merlin & The War of the Dragons. Even though it takes some liberties with the story, it was played seriously and kept my interest all the way throughout. Dragonquest, on the other hand, was...well, strange. Was it supposed to be a campy movie or a more serious effort? I really couldn't tell with Marc Singer doing his best Popeye impression(lol). Still, whatever it was trying to be, it wasn't too bad.",1326240000,,1589,4.6512455516014235

This film by itself I would have given 4 stars easy enough, almost 5 stars.  The special FX are much better than I'm used to seeing in a modest budget film; and so is the acting, sets, and costuming.
""Dragonquest"" released 2009, 88 minutes, PG-13 rated, Sci-Fi / Fantasy, stars Marc Singer; Brian Thompson; Jason Connery; Daniel Bonjour; Jennifer Dorogi; Russel Reynolds; Richard Lund; Jonathan Nation; Mona Lee Goss; and others - was filmed in Los Angeles, California, in the USA.  This film (A.K.A. ""Dragon Quest"" has been shown in Hungary, France, Greece, and the USA.  This film by itself would be getting charity more than deserved to give it 2 stars.  I think this was marketed toward the 5 to 12 year olds age group.  It isn't altogether horrible, I did watch it all the way through.  I kept hoping it would get better (it did - the credits started rolling).
This DVD offered on Amazon as a 2 movie DVD special package, is a great double feature bargain if you buy it cheap enough (new or used); however, there are no special features, no subtitles, no audio options, none of the typical stuff when a movie of recent release is on its own DVD.  On the other hand, both films are in wide screen format.  Good audio, good picture, from Asylum - and worth having.",1321488000,8,1692,4.666666666666667

3747209,2,B001PCOSV4,"Good thing it's only for $6.99.  Our 9-year-old son loves dragons so I thought these movies would at least entertain him.  Well, they didn't quite live up to his expectations.  The special effects were good enough for young children but the fighting scenes were badly done.  It looked like they were taking turns to swing their swords.

Dragonquest storyline sounded interesting unfortunately the movie and actors couldn't deliver.  Nobody could act and the nude scene in the beginning was completely unnecessary.  The young keeper's adventures in finding the precious stones to complete his task were boring.  During one of his so-called adventures, the keeper stood in a cave motionless, just to let a giant spider (or some sort) walk by him.  That's all he needed to do to obtain a stone. How thrilling was that?  The ending of the movie was a bit better because there's not much acting, just a lot of special effects.

The acting of the Merlin and The War of The Dragons was better compared to Dragonquest though some of the actors and actresses sounded more like reciting a school play.  Worst yet, the camera constantly zoomed in on people's faces as a result most of the beautiful Welsh scenes were wasted.  You can't really see what else was going on other than the close up expressions.  After a while it became annoying. The dragons in this movie looked a lot better than the good & evil transparent dragons in DragonQuest, but the story development was not well connected and remained unexplained.  My two boys sat through the movie simply because they thought I would be offended if they didn't finish it.

For Merlin and The War of The Dragons, I give it 3 stars.  But for Dragonquest I give it only 1 star.  That averages 2 stars for this double feature.",1313712000,2,1768,4.722222222222222
3747210,5,B001PCOSV4,"I'm so glad there are small budget non-grandiose fantasy adventure movies that don't have the best CGI or even so-called academy award winning acting in it. Their just fun (even interesting) movies that aren't reaching for the stars, nonetheless can be good in their own way. DragonQuest (2009) is one of these.

The story here is of a fabled world and a reluctant young man (Arkadi/Daniel Bonjour) who is more interested in the ladies yet nevertheless goes on a journey, the path of discovering the seven virtues which is ultimately an inner journey of self-discovery for him. It is a journey which brings victory and his well-being/maturity. And which includes here i might add, a reliable, solid, true companion Katya/Jennifer Dorogi - a strong and well played female part. Kind of a yin/yang thing which also plays into the whole Dragon theme of the story - dragon of light/truth and one of darkness/fear - the real and the unreal.

This is done in a non-heavy handed way with a playful wise teacher Maxim/Marc Singer. The only real setback for this though is his ""death scene"", which is truly ridiculous, and mainly because the scene is so heavy-handed with his last speech being so self-important. It just didn't go well with the rest of his character. But i just looked passed it.

Now besides that, the guys who put this together really put some thought into this movie - well made - just don't expect another movie like Lord of the Rings or make any comparison to anything else - just take it for what it is (don't look for perfection) and you might find something interesting and enjoy it.",1305158400,,1599,4.724014336917563

3747212,1,B001PCOSV4,"So far I only saw Dragon Quest which begins like all RPG games. Your hero is out clowning about when his mentor goes looking for him, something horrible arrives and separates your mentor from you, but before this your mentor gives you the quest object that will be used to save the world, and away our hero goes... the rest follows similar formula of brave kings sacrificing their entire army so this would be savior of the world can make it through the pass... it's almost comical but not in the way that it was attempting to be.

3747214,3,B001PCOSV4,"This is an odd double feature.  It is one disc with both films.  Usually these double features have a separate disc for each film.  Naturally, there is no room for any special features. There are no trailers, subtitles, alyrtnate languages, etc.  There is a menu, but after 10 seconds or so it simply plays the first film. With no intervention,the disc will cycle though menu and first film repeatedly.

And the first film is rather silly. The hero wanders around gathering jewels to stuff in his pendant.  When the pendant is full, he can defeat the dragon.  Marc Singer is old warrior helping out the hero.  He really hams it up.  None of the other actors will win any awards either.  The CGI is not real bad, but it is second class.  I sat through the movie once, but I doubt that I will watch it again.

The second film is better.  This is the story of the origin of Merlin, except that it takes quite a few liberties with the usual story. J&uuml;rgen Prochnow stars as Merlin's mentor. I never heard of the other actors, but at least I don't wince as I call them actors.  I don't expect many awards here either, but everyone did a decent job. The film was made by The Asylum, but it is more intelligent than some other Asylum projects I have seen. Also it is just a PG film, not enough sex or violence is present to bump it up to PG-13 (as with other Asylum projects). This is the better film of the pair, and yes, I might just watch it again sometime.",1286668800,20,1457,4.3088235294117645

3747216,2,B001PCOSV4,"Another Asylum movie.  Some are good, and some are not so good.  This move is somewhere in the middle, with a pretty fast-paced (meaningless?) plot and average acting.  The fight scenes ranged from slow and clumsy to rather well-choreographed.  The limited pieces of orchestral music are effective, but not played nearly long enough; perhaps more of the budget should have gone to the musical score and performance.

Some of the most important scenes in the movie are boring and poorly-filmed.  Marc Singer's final battle-scene should have been serious and important, but it felt like just another death.  The climactic battle . . . kinda stunk.

Needless nudity and a drug reference in the first few minutes of the movie was both funny and unnecessary.  Lord of the Rings and Star Wars are archetypal movies, and this movie combines the two.  This movie could have been epic, but it was only run-of-the-mill.  Two stars.",1280707200,,921,4.954248366013072

3747218,2,B001PCOSV4,"""Daragonquest"" should have been a fairly good movie since it had a decent cast, a passable plot, and even a fair amount of CGI effects. I actually like even mostly bad Sword & Sorcery movies, so it's hard to say exactly when I noticed that getting through the entire 1 hour and 25 minutes was going to be rough.

I'm not really sure at which market this straight to video movie was aimed at. The lead character (and ""Hero of Virtue"" I might add), Arkadi (Daniel Bonjour), besides being woefully passive, is fond of smoking mind altering magic ""weed"" and spying on partially undressed girls. There are several other ""real"" actors, including Marc Singer (who looks almost permanently annoyingly amused), Brian Thompson (seriously underutilized), Jason Connery (actually not too bad), and Jennifer Dorogi (really not action movie hero material). The supporting cast was wooden at best and gave almost laughable delivery of their lines.

The plot follows a standard quest type format and should have been enough to hold the movie together, but sadly it was dragged down by the bad acting, a really bad script, and very bad, although plentiful, CGI effects. The cinematography was fairly good in most of the traveling scenes but was seriously marred by the bad and disjointed editing of the action scenes that was required to mask the poor hand to hand fighting skills of the actors. There are also a painful amount of continuity errors and lack of attention to detail; for example, I am fairly certain that a naked sword carried in rope belt would not make a ""metallic ringing"" sound when drawn.

There really is very little to recommend about this movie, other than it is in Sword & Sorcery genre. Only if you have a driven desire (like me) to see all movies of this type would want to invest your time here, otherwise I would pass on this one (I only wish I could have).

8333120,2,B001PCOSV4,"This was the first 'fantasy adventure' movie I had to just shut off. I could not even be bothered to complete watching it. There are two things that really killed it for me.

First is that the 'badass woman' is evidently the least competent fighter and the movie wants to make this obvious. THey make this obvious by having her get slapped, open-handed, multiple times during her first fight. And, she seems to be the only fighter that requires jump cuts to how her inability to act out a fight scene. Her moves and attacks are really pathetic, but she wins her fights because.. token female. She really does not have any personality either. Just anger when dealing with the protag and mild amusement when watching him from afar.

The second thing that killed it, was the wild fluctuations in quality. One minute we have a well choreographed fight scene with a dozen guys. Next scene scene the token female needs multiple weapons and several attempts to take down A bandit that's unarmed and won't even form a fist while fighting her. The CGI is just as bad. One moment they have a dragon that is half made of fire and half made of embers. Complete with ripples of heat moving over the ember parts just like if you blow on the coals of a campfire. Very professional. The next scene is a vague green worm with very little detail, and a scene inside said worm's stomach that looks like a pile of sheets with green rippling filter over the whole screen. Something a 12 year old should be proud of but should never make it into anything with a budget bigger than a minecraft video on youtube.

I really want to NOT hate this, because I have been on a huge kick for D&D-esque movies lately. But this one fluctuates so badly that it's hard to stay immersed in it.",1523232000,,1757,4.4672897196261685
