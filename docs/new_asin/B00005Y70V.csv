7956857,1,B00005Y70V,"I was looking for a DVD on elephants for my son, who is two and quite keen on the pachyderms. I wanted to wean him off cartoons (his favourite is the elephant scene in Jungle Book) and get him to see a bit of variety, so I was quite happy when I read the storyline of this film, set in india and about a boy who befriends a baby elephant.

Well, it took me 50 seconds to understand why I've never head of this movie, and a dogged half an hour waiting for it to improve, against all odds, which it didn't.  This movie is TERRIBLE.  The acting is stilted and formulaic, the filming is dreadful, the colour not at all good.. it almost felt like I was watching a rental VHS tape.

Can I recommend it? NO. Not unless you are deaf dumb and blind, like using DVD's for frisbies, into masochism, or an alien from outer space who is interested in our (lack of) culture.  This is the worst review I have ever given.. I always try and look for SOMETHING good.. The picture on the cover of a boy on an elephant. That's it!",1227571200,2,1010,4.106598984771574
7956858,5,B00005Y70V,"I am so happy that I chose this DVD for our family to view and enjoy for that is exactly what we did. Parts of the story move slower than most of the newer films, but what happens is most important. In our fast paced life, this was a refreshing change harking back to simpler times and days when depth was included in an experience of incredible magnitude. I am so happy to have discovered this gem, and my children LOVED it! It was profound to watch and I found myself sitting on the edge of the couch a few times!! If you want drama, this is it!",1200355200,2,547,4.074074074074074
