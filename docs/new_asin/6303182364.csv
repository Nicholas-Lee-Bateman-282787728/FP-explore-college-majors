588773,5,6303182364,"I've always heard of Gilad, but never tried his videos.  I only joined gyms to go to the step classes, so I'm a huge fan of step.  Most of the videos I've tried haven't really interested me.  But this one is easy to follow but really gets your heart rate up.  I was sweating like crazy by the end and really felt like I had a good workout.

This video does not have fancy step choreography, but it is a solid workout and REALLY works the muscle groups.  The stepping part is secondary to the tone, but you're working out nonetheless.  In fact, you barely notice you're doing step during the routine, but afterwards you really feel it.

I gave it five stars because it is ""step and tone"" and it is a great workout.  He breaks the workout down into pieces, so you can do 30 minutes, 40 minutes or a full hour.  I also found that after the second time I did the video I was completely familiar with the routine enough to be focusing on my form instead of what the next step was.

My husband complains that it sounds like he's barking orders...but that could just be because they're out on a beach (I noticed that about his other step video too).  I don't feel like he is.  Also, I have worked out in gyms before, so I know how to do a lot of the weight lifting parts, but he doesn't actually go over proper form except for on the step.  So if you're not big on weights, watch the video carefully so you know you're form is correct.

All in all, I wish I had this video years ago.",1183766400,23,1476,4.129824561403509
588774,4,6303182364,"I love Gilad, but after a couple months, I'm still not sure if I like this workout.  It could be my lack or coordination.  I have trouble using heavier than three-pound hand weights without tripping on my step a lot.  Since I'm using seven- and ten-pound hand weights for weight training, there's really no benefit to using the three-pound weights for this step workout.  But the step workout alone doesn't offer enough intensity to increase my heart rate.  A little bit of a fitness Catch-22 for me.

If you like Gilad and you like step aerobics, I still think this video is worth a try.",1180656000,,588,4.552380952380952
588775,5,6303182364,"I began using this workout in early '90s - the time of it's release - when step aerobics was fairly new.  I recently broke my VHS tape and was glad to find the DVD to replace it.

The routine is broken down so that you can choose to do a few minutes of the step routine, target your lower body areas (there's a whole section that uses the step to do more intense squats and lower body toning w/out weights), or you can do the entire tape.  It doesn't have a lot of choreographed dance moves, which makes it easy to follow and do in a small foot area. Yet, there's enough variety to make it fun. If you're not (what I call) a ""workout warrior"", it's intense enough where you can work up a nice sweat, but not so intense that you feel like you are going to pass out half way through. And as stated by other reviewer's, you can easily increase or lower the intensity by using heavier weights or elevating the step, which Gilad states in his introduction.

After 13 years, it's still one of my top-5 home-workout tapes/DVDs!",1166227200,43,1020,4.269430051813472
588776,3,6303182364,"I think the DVD says this is an Intermediate/Advanced level workout. I would disagree with this. My heart rate barely moves up past the normal range. The moves are incredibly simple, which is probably good since you're dealing with weights the entire time. It's nice in that respect. In other words, it's not one of those DVDs where there is a stint of cardio, then a stint of weights, then a stint of cardio, etc. You are stepping and using hand weights the entire time. (Mostly the stepping consists of the basic step with some sporadic high knees and leg curls.) I suppose you could make it more challenging by raising the step, using heavier weights, or putting ankle weights on your legs (which might not necessarily be safe, so I'm not recommending it). In that way, it is also nice - you can control the level of intensity. Personally I like to do this DVD when I'm feeling tired because it isn't too challenging but will give me about an hour of workout time. So I use it when I want a lengthy but undemanding workout.",1160179200,31,1026,4.491978609625669
588777,5,6303182364,"This step workout is great for those who don't want a lot of dancy moves.  The most complicated foot work is a grapevine and a turn step.  So if you don't have a lot of room for running around the step and performing dance steps, this DVD is perfect.  Cueing is good, routine is fun, and offers good variety.  Intensity can be increased by using heavier weights and raising step height.  Music rather upbeat, although not really predominate in the workout.  Overall, a good basic step workout with weights for toning.",1138579200,68,517,4.626373626373627
588778,5,6303182364,"I used the video tape of this exercise routine for several years until I wore it out.  I started using it when I was very out of shape and unable to use a step.  I then progressed to the step, adding on levels, then to weights, and then to heavier weights.  As you can tell, this video is great for use from beginners to those experienced enough to use weights while aerobicizing. It is a lot of fun, and I never get bored with it.",1123113600,77,431,4.047058823529412

588876,4,6303182364,"I definitely like this dvd. I never tried any of Gilad's workout videos before, so his routine is a little complicated for a beginner. But with practice it will become easier. I recommend watching the dvd a few times before starting.

Overall this is a great dvd for anyone. But if your looking for a hard or advance workout this is not for you.",1460419200,,345,4.390625
588877,5,6303182364,"It's great! I love doing this workout and look forward to it. Gilad is best at instruction and letting you know what is coming next. After a couple of workouts, you'll be telling him what's next. And if you're used to his regular aerobics routines, then it will be even easier to follow. If you don't know Gilad, he makes moves so easy for anyone to understand. I do this in my tiny living room with no problem. I hope others enjoy it as much as I do.",1458086400,2,451,4.136363636363637
588878,4,6303182364,"Makes you sweat and is kinda complicated compared to the jenny ford I like to do. Since Gilad was the only one with the 5 star ratings, I had to check it out to see how good it was. You really gotta watch this one several times to follow through.",1458000000,,246,3.94
588879,5,6303182364,This is a solid workout - and the classic 80s aerobic outfits are amusing while you sweat! Easy enough to pick up the moves but still challenging enough to be a good workout.,1455753600,2,174,4.303030303030303
588929,4,6303182364,"I remember doing Gilad videos in high school gym class (now I'm 38 to give you a sense of how long ago that was).  And this workout is definitely from that era -- you can tell in the outfits and hairstyles of the participants, but also from the music.  That being said, I get a good workout when I use this.

There are lots of options for customization.  You can skip some of the segments, use a lower or higher step height, increase or decrease the weight you use (one of the demonstrators is not using weights at all), etc.  I usually do the first 40 minutes and stop after the upper body segment because I am mostly looking for cardio.

The upper body/cardio part consists of a string of segments where you do various basic footwork patterns with different arm movements, where the arm movements involve using weights (things like bicep curls, chest presses, rows, etc.).  You learn an increasing number of moves and then put them all together, run through three times, then move on to the next.  It's not the most exciting step routine ever, but it's also not hard to follow.  (There's no complex choreography to keep up with.  Gilad has a slightly different take on a basic step move, compared to Kathy Smith or Denise Austin, and it took me a bit of time to get that in my head.)  The routine seems slow but then you look at the clock and realize you're almost done!  (The other segments are par for the course in 1990s exercise DVDs.)

One word of warning.  If you have trouble with your knees, be very careful during the warmup.  There are moves to stretch your shins and Achilles tendons.  While this is a great idea, I found these to be rather painful and I usually end up just not doing them.

The background is a little distracting.  This is done on a beach.  There are surfers and swimmers in the background.  Sometimes they stop and stare at the group of exercisers.  Although mostly I was able to pay attention.  Gilad's voice is clear and easy to understand, and the demonstrators behind him clearly know what they're doing and can keep up.  I'm not sure that I buy that the men in the DVD do those sorts of workouts to get muscles like they have, but whatever.

I would say this is beginner-to-intermediate difficulty but you can extend its useful lifetime by using a higher step or heavier weights.  For equipment, you do need a step (it does not have to be a super long one in this instance) and some dumbbells.  He recommends 1 pound for women (to start); I don't have 1 so I used 2 and that was fine.  I may pick up some 5s next time and switch them out for the 2s when my arms get tired.

Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.  I'm using this about once a week as a way to mix things up.  My heart rate doesn't go through the roof or anything, but I do break a sweat.",1452643200,8,2789,4.328185328185328

I will say that though the movements are easy the pace is fast which is why THE DVD says it is an intermediate/advanced workout.

I found it here, as a great way to get this middle-aged body into motion to lose those extra 20 pounds.  For me, stepping is a better low impact functional workout than, say, elliptical because more muscles are worked.  Yes, this DVD is very '90's, but is a golden oldie.  The choreography is easy and well-cued. The stepping is all standing, no floor work up and down.  There is no high impact jumping. You do not get bored, since you are doing the toning upper body movements.  Even though I consider myself an intermediate exerciser, heed the warning and start on the low end, one riser with 1-2lb hand weights like I did.  This will quickly catch up with you.  The DVD is in sections, so you can decide how much you want to do.  Besides the stepping, there are a lower body toning, including squats, and abs sections, both worthwhile, giving you over 1 hour of exercise time.  You will feel it all over.",1393027200,14,982,4.528409090909091

589112,5,6303182364,"This is the greatest ""4 limb"" step workout I've ever found!! (really!). And there is not many of them out there that I can find!!! (or at least ones that have continuous aerobic stepping using dumbells for an entire 30-40 min straight without stopping in between!) Thank you Gilad for creating this timeless classic workout!!!!

It's easy to follow, the steps are very basic, Gilad's cuing is superb as always, the dumb bell movements are easy but effective, there's a little bit of lower body toning, abs, and a wonderful view of the beach!!! What more can you want? :)

If you love basic non -dance step aerobics, then this is for you! If you also love ""4-limb"" workouts with light dumbells and high reps, than this is for you! If you love aerobics mixed with toning than this is for you! If you don't mind that this workout is a little dated, than this is also for you! If you workout indoors and enjoy viewing the beach, than this workout is definitely for you!  (or any of Gilad's videos for that matter) ;)

I'm a high intermediate-advanced exerciser and I use this almost every 2-3 days sometimes!! During my weeks of just high cardio I usually include this and alternate it with Gin Miller's Power Moves to help burn more fat quickly! I have done the entire workout and boy does it feel good! I can feel every muscle in my arms! 3lbs work just fine for me too but if I want to bump up the toning I will use 5lbs! The moves are very easy to do and to follow. Like others have said, you WILL use the dumbells for the entire stepping segments!

I use my 6 inch stepper, but for higher advanced exercisers, you may want to use 8 inches, or heavier dumbells. I will say it is easy to modify with heavier weights which is also why I LOVE this workout! The arm movements are not too fast which is great for those who want to go heavier some days, or lighter on others. So very versatile too!!

For the aerobic stepping:

The first segment you focus on biceps. The second segment you focus on shoulders. The third segment you focus on back and triceps. THAN you do them all together in a row! During the step aerobics my heart rate stays up there in my zone so I know I'm getting a good solid cardio workout along with light toning. FIRM workout lovers- you WILL enjoy this!!! (especially if you are highly into the FIRM Classics and don't mind the dated look and music)-infact this workout pairs GREATLY with FIRM Classic Vol 4 on alternate days too. The music was a bit boring, but trust me, you are too distracted working so good during the step that you probably won't mind (although I was secretly hoping for a more ""beachy-tropical"" caribbean style type music lol). The stepping is also very basic and repetitive, but mind you-this is most likely because of  safety -since it would be more dangerous to incorporate complicated cheography dancy steps while using dumbells on a step in most cases. It also makes it more easier to pay attention to your form and arm movements without tripping all over the step. So I'm honestly glad the stepping wasn't so complicated if I'm going to be using my arms with dumb bells, esp for this long in a workout. ;)

The lower body portion:

You will use your step, and he does squats, calf raises, and more squats using one leg at a time on the step. You can also choose to grab heavier dumb bells for a more challenge, or you can use none like I do and still feel a good burn. :) The lower body toning is not as long as the stepping portion, but its a great little add on and the moves are very easy and everything is done while standing. :) For those who are short on time, they can simply use this for the aerobic part and abs section only.

The Abs:

Very basic, but thorough enough to feel a good ab workout. :) Not the hardest ab workout I've done of course, but a nice addition to getting that full body tone workout when you do the whole entire video.

I feel absolutely refreshed after finishing this entire workout. I prefer to not use any weights during the lower toning part but on some days I may just grab my 15 lbs and use them for some extra ""umph""! ;)

Overall Grade A++ for a great solid cardio/tonight workout!! If you find this workout a bit challenging, don't give up! Just don't use weights if you are a beginner OR only use 1-2 lbs at most, but always make sure you get the stepping right before using weights. But if you are advanced-heavy up or use a higher step and you WILL feel challenged!

589147,5,6303182364,"I used to follow Bodies in Motion back in the 90s. Recently I decided I needed to get back into shape, and bought this DVD. I found other step dvds to be too fast and confusing.

I found the pace of this one with Gilad perfect. I couldn't believe  how uncoordinated I had gotten and how out of shape. But Gilad gives great instructions, and because they are also using weights, he goes slower than in videos where he is not using weights.

I didn't use weights in the beginning. In fact, I didn't use my arms. Within a couple of weeks I was able to keep up, and started doing the arm motions as well. I have shoulder problems, and I find these big arm movements have been helping! Now after 5 weeks, I can follow along well, do all the arm and leg movements, and enjoy working out.

I recommend that you repeat the first sections until you are comfortable. Then move on to the next as you can. My coordination has improved hugely, and I can do the whole 45 minutes.

I do find his warm-up a bit difficult, and I still can't do the leg workout at the end, but I'll get there.

I recommend this dvd for beginners to advanced. Beginners don't start with weights. Advanced can use the weights and put the step up higher if they like.",1381795200,5,1229,4.230769230769231

This workout can be tailored to your needs whether you are a beginner, pregnant, advanced, whatever. You can step it up or step it down so to speak. It doesn't get boring because 1. Gilad is so cute and has that accent and 2. he keeps the steps varied so you are always keeping track of what you are doing next ... you don't get bored but you are not overwhelmed either. It arrived in good condition so I was pleased with the seller as well. Gilad also explains why and what you are doing throughout, so you understand what body part you are working.",1377907200,2,685,4.119402985074627

I love the focus on the right way to do the exercises, the information on which muscles groups are being worked, the clear cueing.  Absolutely love his functional workouts where strength work is combined with aerobics.  I don't really enjoy the strength work as much but it is essential and this way you get a two for one and when you are done, you are done.  I'm pretty fit for my age but I found this a challenging workout (NOT easy, NOT too hard- about right).  I do this on days I am looking for an intense workout and do some of the other beach workouts when I am doing a slower day.  Now, if you are the type of person that likes the exercise where you hold your right foot in your left hand while you jump on the step with your left foot while holding a rose in your mouth, this is NOT for you.  It is simpler (which I like).  It is hard to do an intense workout if you are still trying to figure out what the heck the instructor meant by an inverted V step followed by a L step into a grapevine with a backwards somersault.

589196,5,6303182364,"This is a great workout because it covers cardio and strength from your shoulders down to your ankles and targets everything in between, including a section dedicated to abs.  I'm impressed by those who find it ""easy"" as I do not, even though I think I'm in moderately good shape for a 53 yr. old.  If you don't skip any of it and use a little more weight in the first section I can't see how you won't work up a good sweat - even with the A/C on!  It is however not a quickie set, it takes well over an hour end to end.

Like most of Gilad's routines it's quite easy to follow, even for uncoordinated folks like me.  I'm finally replacing my VHS tape with the DVD. Got sick of rewinding. You can run these routines over and over because Gilad has a great presentation style.  The friendly drill-sergeant.  Take it!",1365638400,,815,4.253246753246753

589234,4,6303182364,"I researched this Gilad guy online and he has a pretty good track record.  This DVD is for beginner to intermediate levels.
It works every part of the bod.  I'm a woman in my 50+ and have been diagnosed with high cholesterol, so I need to exercise more.  Like many people, I seem to find no time to exercise, so I have this DVD permanently set-up in my player and I make it a point to exercise 4x a week with this DVD, and let me tell you, I work out a sweat. Hard to beleive that seeing and hearing this guy on DVD would be so motivating.  Since this DVD is quite lengthy  for my own good, I tailor my workout (one session: upper body, next session: lower body), being careful to do the warm ups and cool downs (don't need to hurt myself as I don't heal up quickly like I used to). This DVD makes it possible to pick and choose what is needed, as it is divided in various sections.

Gilad explains very clearly how to do certain exercises so you won't injure yourself.  That's perfect for me due to my age and the fact that I'm out of shape. So just remember that based if you are in pretty decent shape, you will possibly find no challenge at all with this DVD.  Gilad has other DVD's on the market for all levels of fitness.  You just have to go check out the internet.

I like the setting in this video: beautiful sandy beach, inviting ocean, with people swimming or walking along the beach.  It makes you want to call the airline and go South right now (winter here...brrrr!).",1325980800,10,1481,4.1978798586572434

589239,5,6303182364,This is by far one of the best step weight workouts out there.  It's dated -- I think it was filmed in the early 90s -- but the routine is solid.  You're using weights in combination with the step for 90% of the workout and you can really feel the burn by the end.  The step portion is perfect for those of us who have two left feet -- lots of stepping up and down and side to side motions without the weird jumps and pseudo-dance steps that now dominate most step workouts.  I use this workout routinely twice a month and I have dozens of videos!,1289088000,2,547,4.08411214953271

The actual footwork is VERY basic. In fact, this is one DVD that my husband will actually do with me because it isn't dancy at all - just up down, up, down.

What I like about Gilad is there isn't any fancy or dancy moves that are difficult to learn.  The ""Step & Tone Workout"" is basic and easy to learn, yet you still get a great workout because you are using weights and constantly moving.  I started with 3lb weights, but am now using 5lb weights (boy will you feel the burn on your arms!!).  I like to add this workout after I do cardio for a total body workout.  I own about 30 workout videos and this one will always be included in my workouts!!

I used this tape so much that after a while I didn't even have to listen to the audio and would just crank up my own music and go through the motions.  Eventually the tape wore out and I am going to purchase a new copy. I used this tape as a beginner and had no trouble with it.  I went at my own pace and left out the weights.  There are 3 different segments to the video so in the beginning I only did the first and then added the other parts along with weights as I got stronger and more aerobically fit.

I've been working out for a month now and shouldn't have had a problem with a beginner level video but after looking at the back cover of the dvd this is in fact for intermediate/advanced level.
