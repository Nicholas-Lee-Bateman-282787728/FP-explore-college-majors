7933549,1,B000059HBR,"This video looks like it was filmed during the 1950s. It is really blurry and you can barely make out the furry creatures on this DVD. I thought it was a quality DVD recording, but it looks so cheap, like someone spliced an educational film from the 1950s and put it on this DVD.

Do NOT buy this unless you like wasting money.",1262563200,,327,4.190476190476191
7933550,4,B000059HBR,"This is a cute documentary on furry creatures.  My 3-year old daughter likes it, but it would probably appeal to children a little older as well.  It is only 20 minutes, however (a little shorter than most DVD's).  But if you want a video to capture a child's attention other than a cartoon, it's good.",1029456000,4,302,4.454545454545454
