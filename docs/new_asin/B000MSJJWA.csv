8171630,3,B000MSJJWA,"""Poor Girl"" was part of ITV's 1974 Haunted series which comprised only 2 dramas, the other being ""The Ferryman"". The story has shades of James' The Turn of the Screw but nowhere near as brilliant as the former. The setting is early 1900s England where a young woman named Florence Chasty (Lynne Miller) is hired as a governess to a precocious boy named Hilary Wilson (Matthew Pollock). Hilary develops an unhealthy obsession for his lovely young governess though this is only alluded to in the story. Meanwhile the boy's parents, cold Louise (Angela Thome) and father Oliver (Stuart Wilson) go about their boring mundane lives. Soon, Florence begins to experience strange visions and sees a young couple wandering about the estate though no one else appears to see them and she feels like someone/something else is taking over her mind and body.

As in Turn of the Screw, it is not immediately apparent whether Florence's visions are a result of psychological turmoil or supernatural occurrences. The acting is OK, and the film obviously shows its age,  but I watched it till the end just so I could figure out what was going on. At a running time of only 50 minutes, there's not much time to fully develop the storyline (which I believe was penned by Elizabeth Taylor) but it is an oddly compelling story.",1369008000,,1306,4.8
