8109642,1,B000EHIL0A,"PBS superstars and more superstars of the seventies is all what these DVDs are, It is a Shame and an advertisement lie to get you to buy repackaging releases.",1371600000,,158,4.482758620689655

8109644,1,B000EHIL0A,"There should be a law that states that a company cannot repackage a known or previously release product and market it as something new, they should at least state the product is the same as this certain product that is no longer sold. this is nothing more than the Superstars of the Seventies series. the more superstars of the seventies, etc. This is a rip off if you have previously bought the older DVD, if its the first time then only then you get to enjoy the DVD.",1365897600,,469,4.340909090909091
8109645,5,B000EHIL0A,"I've been to a few of these shows in Atlantic City. The show on this DVD was performed at The Borgata Hotel/Casino in Atlantic City, NJ in 2005. There are 4 other volumes in addition to this DVD and I have those as well. Although the picture quality is very good and the sound quality even better, I just wish they would have made them available on
Blu-Ray (High Def). The performances are excellent. It's amazing how good some of these groups still sound considering they've been around since the 60's-70's. Granted, not all of the original members are still around. However, the few that remain can still belt out the classic hits we all remember. If your a fan of the Old School Soul then I think you will really enjoy this DVD. Every now and then I'll have a get together with friends/family and I'll pop in this DVD along with the other 4 volumes I spoke about and everyone loves it. They get up and start dancing & singing. They're a really big hit all the time. The tracks on this DVD are as follows:

1. You are my friend - Patti LaBelle
2. Hold back the night -Earl Young & The Trammps
3. Boogie nights - Heatwave
4. Lead me on - Maxine Nightingale & Pure Gold
5. Betcha by golly wow - The Stylistics
6. You are everything - The Stylistics
7. I'm stone in love with you - The Stylistics
8. Break up to make up - The Stylistics
9. The love I lost - Harold Melvin's Blue Notes
10. Don't leave me this way - Harold Melvin's Blue Notes
11. Are you my woman - The Chi-Lites
12. Nightshift - The Commodores
13. Just to be close to you - The Commodores
14. Sweet love - The Commodores
15. I don't know how to love him - Yvonne Elliman
16. More than a woman - Tavares
17. It only takes a minute - Tavares
18. Lost in music - Debbie & Joni Sledge of Sister Sledge
