3657663,5,B001JFKVHM,"This could be the funniest show on TV.  I would love to know how they create this show.  Do they start with ""endpoints"" (crazy scenarios) and figure out how Tim would wind up in them in the first place?  Or do they say, ""What if Tim fought an old man?"" and go from there.  Either way, this is a freaking hysterical show,",1228953600,15,320,4.112903225806452

3657692,4,B001JFKVHM,"did you read that. pissed when hbo didn't renew this show.

this is not a review for the dvd, but for the show, will update if needed, but probably not

one of my most favorite shows. hbo has aired many of my absolute favorite, cant get out of my head shows: life and times of tim, six feet under, sex and the city. then they went and didn't renew tim. i don't have hbo anymore anyway, so i don't have hbo go, but i don't even think them hookers had it as an option to view on hbogo. anyway, this is one of the funniest, ""wth"" shows i've seen. the situations they come up with are funny enough, but the reactions and lines they wrote to support it just blow my mind. comedy writers like this amaze me. i hope these guys continue to work and provide people with their hilarity. steve dildarian and etc, not many people appreciated you, but you have a fan in me :)",1420329600,,862,4.125
3657693,5,B001JFKVHM,Dry humor at its best.,1415145600,,22,3.6
3657694,5,B001JFKVHM,"I am STILL unhappy this show was cancelled.  Loved it!  All the characters were just perfect, and the situations hilarious.  Reminds me of Larry David in Curb Your Enthusiasm as Tim gets himself into these awful spots with people, often through his own bad choices but more often through circumstance and no fault of his own.  I'm really glad I bought this.",1411516800,,357,4.709677419354839
3657695,5,B001JFKVHM,Hilarious! He gets himself in the worst situations.,1409961600,,51,5.5
3657696,5,B001JFKVHM,Hilarious.,1405296000,,10,10.0
3657697,5,B001JFKVHM,"I own all 3 seasons of Life and Times of Tim.  It is subtle humor most of the time but not overly gross like Family Guy either.  It's like Seth McFarlane (spelling?) humor without all the disgusting stuff.

Tim is an office guy, gets into hijnx, Nick Kroll is a main character, Tim's Boss could be my favorite character.  There is a priest with a drug, drinking, and prostitute problem.  Oh and gambling addiction too.

Tim is often the scape goat or the patsy or the fall guy.  However you want to say it.  Lot of famous cameo voices throughout all 3 seasons.

I have a hard time finding solid, consistent humor.  Most of the genre is dominated by outdated Adam Sandler pee in the pool jokes, Seth Rogan barf jokes, Workholics bathroom and morbid humor, and Seth McFarlane over the top.

Gone are the days of Peter Sellers.  Until you buy this DVD.  And the other two seasons.

Enjoy.",1401580800,,885,4.45
3657698,5,B001JFKVHM,Since HBO GO removed this show from it's line up I went and ordered all three seasons. This show was/is great and I was sad to see it end at Season 3. If your a fan you may as well order the series cause i'm sure they aren't producing any more dvds and just like the Chris Rock show... it's not on HBOGO,1398643200,2,303,3.8253968253968256
3657699,5,B001JFKVHM,Best show of my life! It is one that I can watch over and over again without getting bored. There are so many great characters on this show. If you're thinking about getting it: Do it! you will not be disappointed. Unless your copy is scratched when it gets to you. Which would be sad. (that did not happen to me. pretty sure mine was new),1389398400,,339,4.151515151515151
3657700,5,B001JFKVHM,"Let's begin with the fact that right away; the. viewed meets his girl friends parents a prostitute, (that he utilized), all mat one time. It all goes great from there.  I think I will just watch this any time I feel sad, it would make any one laugh.",1379635200,,249,4.1875
3657701,5,B001JFKVHM,Unlike anything I have ever seen! Laugh out loud hilarious! I love this show!! A must see cartoon for anyone with a sense of humor!,1376265600,,131,4.28
3657702,5,B001JFKVHM,"My opinion this is one of the best cartoons ever created. Its a shame there is only 3 seasons, because I would love to see a season 4. This show is like a combination of South Park and Seinfeld. It contains the kind of explicit humor you would expect from South Park, and takes place in New York City hinting the Seinfeld.",1375660800,,322,4.209677419354839
3657703,1,B001JFKVHM,"It's always interesting to hear someone describe their own work. The creator often sites commercial or critical failure as the result of being too edgy or some such nonsense. In the case of ""The Life and Times of Tim,"" the work is tightly-packed with pure sociopathic garbage in order to bulk up the scant and unforgivingly uninspired gags/stories (?) This show makes me uncomfortable for the creators' parents, wherever on the planet they might be. An animated show takes a LOT of work to get off the ground, let alone to complete. Despite this, I have absolutely no respect for anyone associated with this project.",1372032000,,616,4.876190476190477
3657704,5,B001JFKVHM,"I love the life and times of Tim. All three series. I think it might need to grow on you for a couple episodes but then the brilliance of the comedy and voices and subtlties becomes apparent. I can watch it over and over and I still love it and only hope more will follow, although series three's ending could be pretty final. So I make do with the three series they made.",1367193600,,372,4.109589041095891
3657705,5,B001JFKVHM,"I have every season of this show and not 1 episode has been disappointing.  The shenanigans Tim get himself into are beyond ridiculous, which make this unbeatable.",1366156800,,163,5.037037037037037
3657706,1,B001JFKVHM,Friend said the show wasn't bad and I have always enjoyed HBO series shows so I though why not? Turns out the reason is after 3-4 episodes you realize you haven't laughed yet and you're bored out of you're mind. You've been warned ;),1362096000,2,233,4.318181818181818
3657707,5,B001JFKVHM,"I'm a big fan of this show.  You can tell they're all sitting in a room together as they record this, cracking eachother up.",1361232000,,124,4.166666666666667
3657708,5,B001JFKVHM,"Life and Times of Tim was sent efficiently, came brand new and in good condition. That said, it's the most hilarious crudely animated show. It focuses on dialogue and to a point the background animating. For instance on a giant shot of the Omnicorp building on the sidewalk a bum could be eating a pigeon or slapping a woman. Just a half second random thing. My favorite character is Stu, voiced by the guy who plays Ruxin on the League. Just wait till you see Debbie the prostitute.",1344556800,,483,4.5
3657709,5,B001JFKVHM,"Season One of the Life and Times of Tim opens with Amy (Tim's girlfriend) and her parents showing up at Tim's apartment finding Tim hanging out with a prostitute.  The comedy is low key but hilarious in an awkward sort of way.  Seriously check out a couple of the full free episodes HBO put up on YouTube, it will drive you to order the DVDs to see more.  It is a shame HBO has done absolutely nothing to let anyone know this show exists.  None of my friends have heard of it, but when I show them an episode they cannot stop laughing.  Hopefully some network picks up Season Four.",1337558400,,581,4.245454545454545
3657710,5,B001JFKVHM,"This series is quirky funny, others and Tim himself gets into awkard situations,
very funny.  If you like red dwarf, black adder, flight of the conchords you will like this.",1330992000,,173,4.766666666666667
3657711,5,B001JFKVHM,"Tim seems like a normal guy, that is, until you meet who he surrounds himself with.  Then you cannot help but wonder how or why that is until you realize he is a bit... odd. While generally well-meaning, the execution of his ""well thought-out"" plans falls a bit short.  Virtually every episode ends with some mixture of gut busting laughter and extreme cringing.",1330473600,,362,4.73015873015873
3657712,5,B001JFKVHM,"After seeing the commercials for this show a few times I finally started paying attention and good god, it has to be the funniest show since Arrested Development. The show is basically scripted but has a great improv feel, the best voice actors around, and a totally fearless take on any situation. Unlike a lot of animated shows, all the actors get together in the same room, and you can really tell the difference in the interaction. It's like nothing else around and you are going to get at least  half a dozen solid, memorable laughs out of every episode. It only gets better with repeated watchings. In short, huge fan. They can't crank these puppies out fast enough for me.",1328918400,,679,4.6115702479338845
3657713,5,B001JFKVHM,"This is one show, that if chosen to pick a show to watch until the end of the universe, would be my pick. This is just one of many amazing HBO shows and totally recommend it.",1297987200,,174,3.861111111111111
3657714,5,B001JFKVHM,"This show is one of the better shows you've never heard of.  The writing is top notch.  The comedy is so funny and clever, and I'm never board.  Though the animation is quite crude, and doesn't really lend itself to any notice, the content more than makes up for it.  I thought the show was hysterical, and have already re-watched the series twice since I bought it.  I highly recomend you give it a chance, you won't be sorry.",1286409600,,427,4.3544303797468356
3657715,5,B001JFKVHM,"So basically this show is about a timid man named tim who works at corporate office and gets himself into the stickiest situations that just snowball until his life is ruined or he ruins someone elses life completely on accident and gets blamed for it.
Its is the funniest show on television no doubt. If i could spend my whole summer watching this show over and over again i would do it in a heartbeat.",1281312000,,403,4.386666666666667
3657716,5,B001JFKVHM,"First of all this is much better when you are an altered state of mind it just makes the jokes so much better.  Tim is the perfect everyman he is a working guy who has a corporate gig and finds himself in trouble in every episode to no fault of his own.  His choices are always wrong and he ends up paying a dear price for these errors in judgement.  Wheter he is helping a hooker or lying for a buddy he is sure to anger his girlfriend and her parents.  The episodes of Tim center around his work, the local bar or his apartment so they never seem to get stale.  There is a comparison to Beavis and Butthead but that is not true Tim is on not crude or crass at all I see more of a comparison to Roseanne this is a hard working guy who has a normal life and he just always seem to get himself in trouble.

In my opinion there is nothing as fresh and funny as The Life and Times of Tim.",1276041600,,885,3.888888888888889
3657717,5,B001JFKVHM,"I came across this show by accident one day, when flipping through channels on HBO.  It caught me totally off guard.  It's extremely subdued, wry and highly comical. I just love it.  It's the kind of show you'll talk about with your friends after watching, guaranteed.",1274227200,,268,4.782608695652174
3657718,5,B001JFKVHM,"to any supposed deities that inflames the passions of  any religious fundamentalists. This show needs to be banned because watching it might be harmful to your health. You might ACTUALLY die laughing. They should have a Surgeon General sticker on the DVD  stating "" Watching Tim trying to weasel his way out of explaining how he won 10 grand at the race track because he bet on a horse that had a name that reminded him of his girlfriend Amy might cause you to stop breathing because it is funnier than anything you have ever seen in your life"". But that warning will be on the second season DVD since that episode just aired recently. Hopefully you will live long enough after watching the first season to get the second season DVD. So go and enjoy  the first season but have a defibrillator nearby. The thing about this show is that the delivery and the dialog is so well crafted and the comic timing is so brilliant that you are literally in awe before you just begin very loud uncontrollable laughter that will have your neighbors complaining.",1272153600,2,1047,4.588235294117647
3657719,5,B001JFKVHM,"""Tim"" is laugh out loud funny...but raunchy.  My favorites are Latino Tim and Rodney's bachelor party.",1268697600,2,102,5.375
3657720,5,B001JFKVHM,"Life and Times of Tim is one funny show. Not much to report DVD wise since it's a crudely drawn animated show but the discs are layed out nice with 10 mini episodes apiece. Video is clean and the audio sounds great. There are 10 short scenes featured as extras. I would have liked to seen a behind the scenes bonus...sort of a ""making of"" scenario but that's OK. It's still worth the price. Looking forward to Season 2.",1268265600,5,419,4.3164556962025316
3657721,5,B001JFKVHM,Have absolutely fallen in love with this show. Am buying the DVD so I can memorize each and every precious line with mindlessly numbing repeated viewings.,1268265600,,154,4.961538461538462
3657722,5,B001JFKVHM,"The first time I saw this show on HBO I laughed so hard I almost cried! This is one of the funniest, most original, and just far out there cartoons on TV. If you enjoy randomness, sarcasm, and just overall hilarity you will love this show. See everything from Tim beating up an old man, to biting a woman on the elevator, or even getting raped by a bum (you just have to watch to find out!!). The low budget animation is just the icing on the cake because it fits Tim's personality perfectly!

Netflix it if you don't believe me, but I had to wait 11 months from the original release date to buy this on DVD and watched the pilot 20 times to try and satisfy my need for Life and Times of Tim. It was worth the wait!!",1267660800,2,716,4.078014184397163
3657723,5,B001JFKVHM,"THE LIFE AND TIMES OF TIM: FIRST SEASON DVD is a must have for fans of shows like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seinfeld-Seasons-1-2/dp/B00005JLEX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seinfeld - Seasons 1 & 2</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/South-Park-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B00023P49M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">South Park - The Complete Second Season</a>&nbsp;where the humor is satirical and pokes fun at everything.

Tim is a New Yorker who is cool without even knowing it. He gets himself into these crazy, awkward situations and yet he manages to stay calm and collected. He's surrounded by equally funny characters like his best friend and co-worker ""Stu,"" who's only aim in life is to score with girls, though they don't want him, and eat ice cream cake,  and ""Debbie,"" the local chain-smoking hooker who gives Tim advice on everything from relationships to whatever. And she shows up wearing the most inappropriate outfits like a bikini in church that will keep you rolling in stitches.

If you haven't checked out the show yet, the second season just started on HBO as of this writing, you should. It's hilarious.

Extras on the DVD:

***10 BONUS SHORTS- combined run time 8:17-minutes-""selection"" or ""play-all"" function
