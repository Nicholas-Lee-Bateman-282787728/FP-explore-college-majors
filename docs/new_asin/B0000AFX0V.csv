7996943,5,B0000AFX0V,This program is exceptional.  The ball is exactly as pictured.  I feel great after doing the exercises.  I only wish it would come out in DVD.,1473638400,,142,4.384615384615385
7996944,4,B0000AFX0V,"I've read the reviews on this product and I don't understand comments about odor or troublesome stickiness. It's a little tacky to enable the ball to be stabilized (and that's better than sliding across the room into the wall).  The video gives excellent directions and while some of the moves take some practice,  in the final analysis, the ball (it's not really a ball it's more like a dumbell shape) helps strengthen your back and will improve your flexibility and that's what it's designed to do.",1196985600,,500,4.8023255813953485
7996945,1,B0000AFX0V,The item was shipped in a timely manner.  It has a slow leak around the plug which requires inflation before every use.  I plan to keep the item since I had such a hard time finding this one.,1193961600,,191,4.0
7996946,4,B0000AFX0V,"I don't know about these other reviews!  My back ball is not sticky, does not smell, and does not move like Jello. First out of the packaging there does seem to be a bit a film that is obviously necessary to keep a large plastic deflated ball from sticking together.  Once pumped up and aired out overnight this goes away.

I have not used the exercise video yet and looking forward to it - but it has a nice full size chart of exercises and I do like the feel and stability of an oblong ball.  It is stable enough for my 3 yr old grandson to roll around doing his own exercises.  When I use my round ball he is able to sit on the oblong ball.",1136332800,8,643,3.9921875
7996947,3,B0000AFX0V,"This is a good product to use to stretch your back (really your torso in general if you do all the steps).  The fact that it is shaped like a dumbell makes it more stable than a ball.  However, the material is more sticky than other fitness balls and one time I leaned it against the wall, and upon separation it took off some paint from the wall.  Good design, bad material.",1135814400,4,375,4.180555555555555
7996948,3,B0000AFX0V,"The materials doesnot look like the one on the picture, and it smells really bad.. I have to put it outside of my room....",1133568000,4,122,4.125
7996949,4,B0000AFX0V,"I bought the backcare kit by Gaiam on the recommendation of my neighbor who has a terrible back.  Though I had to adjust it a few times to get the level that fit me best, it has really helped open my back.  As a result, I use it most every morning and feel it has made a big difference in my flexibility and in turn, my golf game!!!",1129593600,7,332,3.8676470588235294
7996950,4,B0000AFX0V,"I have 2 children and after years of carrying them began experiencing back pain, a friend sent me this kit and I must say I feel so much better, I have developed a strength in my back that wasn't there before, as well as the benefits to my abdomen, I bought one for my mom",1129248000,8,272,3.963636363636364
7996951,1,B0000AFX0V,"Gaiam Back Care inflatable unique oblong SupportBall looks like a jelly been gone bad! It does not hold its shape while you are working out so you constantly need to adjust it which makes the workout extremely difficult, in addition it is sticky to the touch and smells a bit odd ~ I am a fitness trainer at one of the top sports clubs in the world and would not be able to use this with a client, that being said the exercises in the video are very good and would benefit the user if they could adapt to them to a different ball. It is a workout in itself to pump the ball with the enclosed hand pump. Overall I would not suggest this to anyone who is just starting out or not extremely well educated in physical fitness.",1127606400,29,722,4.164285714285715
7996952,5,B0000AFX0V,"This peanut shaped balance ball and video are just the tihng for making a mom's lower back feel better!  I have had trouble with my lower back for years now.  The stress and strain of pregnancies, everyday work, lifting things wrong, etc. has added up to weak abs and sore back.  My back felt better the very first time I used this.  Now I alternate using the regular balance ball and this peanut shaped one.  Slowly but surely, my abs are getting stronger, my back muscles in better condition and my posture greatly improved.  The latter was amazing to me!  If you need to improve muscle tone and stretch all in one workout, this is a great option!",1079740800,6,649,4.4491525423728815
