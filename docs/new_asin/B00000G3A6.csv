1216333,5,B00000G3A6,"Quite simply, Get a Life was is anti-sitcom in which all other sitcoms pale in comparison.  I sold my blood so I could purchase both volumes of this great series (even though I had many episodes on tape).  It was worth  every drop. Volume One is good in that it starts with two shows of the  first season.  However, I tend to like the episodes in which Chris dies at  the end (an aspect of the show that was later ripped off by the uninspired  and pointless ""South Park"" -- I will watch Chirs get squashed by  a boulder or blow up any time).  Nevertheless, Volume One is a must for  the Get a Life fan and anyone who is sick and tired of the cookie-cutter  network comedies.  Volume 2 is even better. My only disappointment is that  there is no word on when Rhino is releasing Volume 3, 4, 5, etc.  Wallet-Boy forever",919555200,,817,4.220779220779221

We were able to obtain  the new videos, Vol 1 & 2, just in time to watch after the Superbowl  this year, and let me tell you, time has not diminished the comedic  brilliance of this series! It was just like the old days - we laughed just  as hard, if not harder, the second time around. I can hardly wait for  future volumes!

In several interviews, Elliott has blamed the ""suits at Sony"" for not releasing a Get a Life complete DVD set. C'mon Sony. You need something to raise that sagging stock price!

Quit acting like a free floating blob of cellulite cast adrift in a sea of cotton candy soaked in dog saliva and release the complete Get a Life now! I am certain it would be a hit. There are millions of fans clamoring for it!

I totally agree that they need to make a full season disk for maybe $30, just like all the other damn sitcom season disks out there. Rhino does this alot. They do the same thing with MST 3000. You have to shell out like $70 to get 2 episodes that they don't include on their Volume disks. What a Rip off!",1160438400,10,439,3.943820224719101
1216399,4,B00000G3A6,"Get A Life was literally so far ahead of it's time it only lasted 3 seasons, and part of me is AMAZED that it lasted that long.  Vol 1 only encompasses 4 of the 36 original Get A Life episodes, and though the 4 it does have are damned funny, they're not worth $10 a peice to own.

It seems like everyone I know remembers the misadventures of the 30+ year old Paperboy with the title track of ""Stand"" by REM.  And almost all of them kind of wonder ""what the hell happened to that show?"" OR they wonder ""what the hell was that show all about?"".

Basically, the show was the father figure to such weird, off based shows such as Malcolm In The Middle or Arrested Development, because it uses a very dark, twisted ""what the hell?"" kind of humor that is only believeable in television, but all together hilarious.  If you think Arrested Development was ""ahead of it's time"" (critics claimed this regularly) then that would be Get A Life would be the equivilent to a Caveman holding a quarter pounder, a flashlight, and a glock with a laser sight.

This show was great and needs to be re-issued on DVD (preferrably in 12 episode, FULL SEASON, DVD's)",1138147200,17,1142,4.388625592417061
1216400,5,B00000G3A6,This show is not for everybody. I find it hilairous in an unfunny way. Some of the stuff he does your just like what the fu.. is he thinking. There a lot of inside jokes in the show that I don't think that they even catch. I just wish that they would release all of the episodes.,1110067200,5,279,3.912280701754386
1216401,5,B00000G3A6,"It's safe to say that without Chris Elliott's GET A LIFE, we probably would never have seen the success of the Farrelly Brothers or ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT.  GET A LIFE set new frontiers in TV comedy by taking the standard sitcom format and turning it on its head.

The premise was simple:  a 30-year-old paperboy still lived at home with his rather less-than-concerned parents (played by Elinor Donahue and Chris' real-life father, Bob Elliott) who tolerated him as best they could while he got into one mess after another.

But this was no LEAVE IT TO BEAVER.  Whereas most sitcoms would take such a premise and turn it into a formulaic, feel-good giggle-fest, GET A LIFE dared to make its lead character into a bizarre man-child who could never see how truly ridiculous his inane behavior was to others.  He lived in his own self-contained world where he was the coolest and hippest guy on the planet.  What saved the character from being either a creep or the butt of everyone's joke was his underlying naivete and childlike innocence, which, in the end, was often enough to help him (barely) triumph over the evil forces in his neighborhood.

Embodied perfectly by Chris Elliott, the indestructible ""Chris Peterson"" was a brilliant sitcom creation who managed to last two seasons on Fox.  But that was only half the story.  The other great thing about GET A LIFE was how the series took standard-issue sitcom plots and twisted them into deranged new forms.  This was like the TWIN PEAKS of sitcoms in the way it constantly challenged the boundaries of both good taste and common sense in order to get a reaction from its stunned audience.  The humor ran the gamut from low-brow to madcap to surreal.  In the 2nd Season, almost every episode ended with Chris getting killed.

The GET A LIFE VOL. 1 DVD collects four great episodes from the first season, including the hysterical ""The Prettiest Week of My Life,"" in which Chris trains to be a runway model.  One of the funniest bits is a takeoff on the infamous Irene Cara scene from FAME.

It's a shame that Rhino never got around to releasing the entire series on DVD, but at least the 8 episodes available on VOL. 1 and 2 are enough to give viewers a sizable appreciation of this short-lived but memorably off-beat sitcom.",1109030400,33,2275,4.707070707070707
1216402,5,B00000G3A6,"I won't say much, except when you see this item listed in the used section, SNATCH IT! Worth it's weight in wheelbarrowed shrimp!",1107561600,,129,4.6521739130434785
1216403,1,B00000G3A6,"The best part of my DVD is the FBI warning at the beginning and the theme song.  I am 4 episodes into to the first dvd and I have not laughed even once.  The humor is not clever.  It is Chris Elliot falling down and hurting himself over and over again, or exposing himself to radiation, and then someone cranks up the laugh track. I liked Chris okay on David Letterman; he wasn't the main attraction, but his skits there were okay, and I appreciated them.  Unfortunately, so far in this first season, this series sucks.  It isn't funny; it isn't clever.  The idea behind the series, a loser who still lives with his parents and has a paper route has promise.  The execution is pathetic.

Let me give you an example of one of the most clever things on the show.  Chris falls in love with a gal in the 4th episode and he confides in Gus that everywhere he looks, he sees this girl's face.  Gus points out that he has pictures of her put up all over his room.  And the camera shows lots of pictures of this girl all over his wall.  Big laughs from the ""audience.""  Now, if that sounds funny to you and put a smile on your face, you will love this series.  Later on, this gal throws a rock from her window and hits Chris in the head.  Again, the laugh track is cranked up.  For me, I don't know if I will watch past this 4th episode.

There are many good reviews here, which are an absolute mystery to me.  Maybe the key is, if ""Married With Children"" is your idea of high comedy, then ""Get a Life"" maybe right down your alley.

Notice on several reviews, people recall how great this series was when they were 11 or 13; but when they see it again, they are suprised as to how bad it is now.  Maybe this would appeal to your 12 year old kid; and maybe if your intellect level is that of a 12 year old, this could be the show for you.  ""Friends,"" which is not my idea of a great show by the way, is probably too subtle for you.",1103068800,7,1922,4.0855614973262036
1216434,5,B00000G3A6,"It isn't often that you find a program where the creators ""get it"".  Get a Life gets it.  People with enough brains to understand the wit behind the silly antics will thoroughly enjoy this series.  Too bad it isn't complete, but I'll take what I can get.  I had to wait ten years for another program like this to surface, and it too was short lived.  After watching this, check out Strangers with Candy.  Lets hope that it doesn't take another decade for cutting edge humor to hit the airwaves.",1095638400,5,494,4.433333333333334
1216435,3,B00000G3A6,"This DVD offers a rare opportunity to some of us; the diehard fans of this sitcom, which appeared on Fox Network in late 1980s and 1990s. This is one of the few funniest TV comedies ever created that did not succeed in TV ratings because it was not aired on a major network. This show is about a 30 year old paperboy who never grows up in every sense of the word. He lives with his retired parents and run into all kinds of zany, sometime off-beat antics that provides entertainment to young and old. It was quite disappointing to many of us that it did not reappear in reruns, but this DVD offers a rare opportunity to view four episodes. The Prettiest Week of my Life is hilarious. Spewey & Me is a grotesque episode that producers could have spared the fans from seeing it; you feel like puking to see Chris drink body-exudates of an alien, and at the end he cuts it open and eat the cooked meat. This is gruesome to say the least for a sitcom. The producers could have sold better and funnier episodes of the show; let us hope the success of this DVD may persuade producers to of the show to market all episodes, and a DVD with 12 episodes are made available to all the fans.",1086566400,19,1179,4.2444444444444445

1216437,4,B00000G3A6,"Chris Elliott is a real loser -- a paperboy who lives in his parents' garage and .... well, isn't that enough?  Each week for almost a month he'd get himself into some silly predicament because his vision of the world was so weirdly skewed. Like scratching $60 together so he can enroll in the Pretty Boy Modelling School, or falling in love with the woman who runs over him, or finding the most disgusting alien ever to set foot in our atmosphere. The supporting cast is great, and the scripts are quite funny.

There is absolutely nothing extra here except one longish uncut scene.  You may also view the episodes with the original audio or without a laugh track.

It's great to see this very funny though short-lived sitcom available on dvd.",1067040000,15,744,4.613636363636363
1216438,4,B00000G3A6,"When it first aired, Get a Life was a major break from what was considered an acceptable format for TV comedy. The principal character -- Chris Peterson, a 30-year-old newsboy who lives with his parents -- was weirdly asocial, perhaps even psychotic -- with no redeeming qualities. He looked good only in comparison with his antagonists, who were usually even more obnoxious than he.
How do you write comedy when the protagonist is so cut-off from the conventions of normal thought and behavior that the other characters reactions are little more than exasperated confusion? The answer is, with great difficulty. Its like trying to assemble a wooden structure without nails. Its hard to get laughs through character interaction when the main character doesnt interact in any normal way with the other characters.
About all you can do is mine Chris Elliots innate weirdness. So not only is Get a Life weird -- it's weird merely for the sake of being weird. The writers aren't worried whether the stories make sense, either practically or psychologically, because Chris Peterson neither worries nor makes sense. What other sitcom has ever shown a dummy of the main character being repeatedly run over by cars?
Clearly, Get a Life is a show about style, not content. In trying to be different from other sitcoms, the producers painted themselves into a corner thats hard to maneuver in.
The reaction of some reviewers -- that Get a Life isn't as funny as they remembered  isn't surprising. The shock and novelty of a pointless show about someone incapable of mundane social interactions has worn off.
Nevertheless, Get a Life is generally funny, and has a few really good episodes. Neptune 2000 remains my favorite, if only because it gives Bob Eliot the most on-screen time and the largest number of put-downs. Its a model of how this sort of humor should be done, and is arguably a classic of TV comedy.
For me, the shows greatest pleasure is Bob Eliots deadpan-sarcastic putdowns. I grew up listening to Bob & Ray, two of the great comic geniuses of the last century, who virtually invented pointless humor.
Amazon wants reviewers to focus on the content, but I cant resist taking a pot shot at Rhino. Is there any other record company that delivers so little for the consumers hard-earned buck? There are only four episodes on each disk, where Red Green delivers eight. And Get a Life has a sufficiently large cult following that a multi-disk set with all the episodes would have made sense.",1054166400,,2492,4.863529411764706
1216439,3,B00000G3A6,"Don't get me wrong, Get A Life was a great show and I am glad to see it on DVD. My complaint is the way it was handled. This ""Volume 1"" contains episodes from both the first and second season. I would have much rather the first four episodes of the show rather than just random episodes from both seasons. Also this DVD provided very little extras. It isn't like Chris Elliot is that busy that he couldn't have stopped by for some commentary or something on the show.",1024272000,4,467,4.258426966292135

The other episodes are quality ones as well.  There were dud episodes in the series as a whole but these are all great.  If you don't like Chris Elliot's and his writers' humor then you probably can't even read so I won't get into cut-downs here but if someone is reading this for you then call me at ____________ for some big-league snaps.  But seriously, my mother loved the series as much as me and she was drunk half the time so it appeals to all kinds.  Bob Odenkirk of ""Mr. Show"" semi-fame even wrote two episodes for Get A Life though neither of them is in this DVD or the next available DVD so it's just trivia I guess.  The paperboy character Chris plays is such a great fit for his style and you know Brian Doyle-Murray [as ""Ted"" in 1st episode on the DVD (""Prettiest Week"") and as ""Gus"" in second season episodes (last 2 on this DVD)] is always kickin' out the jams.

Chris Elliot has a unique comedy style which never caught on with many  viewers; but watch these 4 shows and you'll be starting a petition to bring  the show back. ""Spewey and Me"" will kill you. An alien crashes on  his front lawn, and Chris befriends him even though all the alien does is  beat and vomit on him.  If you saw his later movie, ""Cabin Boy,""  you'll be a bit disappointed because he eased off the comedy he brought to  ""Get A Life."" But these are episodes you can watch over and over  again, then cry after you see the junk they put on TV to replace this.  So  when you see a poor review for this show, perhaps it was given by a person  who thinks ""Spin City"" is funny. Or maybe somebody who cracks up  at the commercials for ""Veronica's Closet."" Or maybe it's just  some demented, crazed junkie (I hear some drugs make funny things dumb and  dumb things funny).",968198400,5,1080,4.293532338308458

I'm glad that at least a few episodes of Get a Life have made  it out to DVD. Let's all keep our fingers crossed for DVD editions of more  Get a Life, The State, and... Cabin Boy.

1216514,1,B00000G3A6,"For some reason, I remember this show as being hilariously funny back in 1990.  Two things must have happened since then:  either I remember only  the good episodes--unlikely since there appears to be none, or I suffered  from a seriously juvenile sense of humor.  Unfortunately, I think the  latter is correct.  This DVD is a complete waste of $20.  How Chris Elliott  EVER got his own show is beyond comprehension, although I suspect a casting  couch and a pact with the devil were involved.
As far as productions go,  the four episodes presented here are bottom-of-the-barrel amateurish fare:  ""Prettiest Week Of My Life"" has its short moments of brilliance  but too many unfunny minutes go by in the process, ""Bored  Straight"" suffers from unbelievably forced acting (looks more like a  rehearsal than an actual shoot), ""Spewey And Me"" is insultingly  stupid and mind-rotting (not to mention completely unfunny...there's not a  laugh to be found in this one), and while ""Girlfriend 2000"" is  the better episode of the lot it's not enough to justify or even sustain  the other three episodes.
Technically, the DVD image is a bit grainy and  lacks crispness.  It looks as if they taped it directly from a television  during the original broadcast and copied the whole thing onto a DVD.  The  chapter access feature is standard.  The laugh tracks can be turned off on  three of the four episodes: it is this feature that reveals how really  awful this show is...without the laugh tracks, the juvenile scripts are  glaringly unfunny.  Finally, the previously-unseen ""bonus""  footage has been unseen up until now for a very good reason: it's terrible!
Avoid this DVD.  Save your money for something else.",965692800,4,1703,4.9537366548042705

If anything, get this just for ""Girlfriend 2000"".  It's  the funniest thing that has ever been on tv.  This is the best tv show next  to Upright Citizens Brigade.

And 'Gus Borden', played to perfection by Brian Doyle  Murry, is to this day one of my favorite characters in ALL of fiction.

The episodes are so funny!  I mean watching ""Spewey and  Me"", I felt I was going to bust a gut.  ""Get A Life"".  It's  moronic humor at its best. As for the DVD extras, with a TV show DVD, there  isn't much on it.  Well there are Never-Before-Seen Bonus footage and an  alternate audio version without a laugh track (but it's good to have that  one on), the 4 uncut episodes, I wonder if they mean that there are no  commercials. I don't know. If you loved the show, you will give it an A  which I did.  If you thought this show was quite daft, you wouldn't give it  an A and score this DVD low.  I score it a B-, A because I always liked the  show and a C- for not many extras but what can you expect.  Rhino did a  great job at releasing this DVD.  Hmmm....I thought maybe they can fit five  or 6 episodes but 4 is good for now.  Also, the DVD is not expensive.  Love  ""Get a Life""?  Then purchase it on DVD!",959126400,8,1063,3.7880184331797233
1216522,5,B00000G3A6,"Chris Elliott's comedy tends to polarize viewers -- you either think it's the funniest thing you've ever seen, or you become violently angry that someone like THAT has been allowed on teevee. If there were more people  like the former, Get A Life would still be on the air, and Chris Elliott  would be rich and famous. Unfortunately, here on Earth, the show got  cancelled early, and until recently, has been unavailable on tape or on  reruns. If you're the kind of person who finds watching incredibly stupid  people (portrayed by smart comedians) doing incredibly stupid things  unbearable, maybe you ought to look and see if you can get Friends or  Seinfeld on cassette.

1216523,5,B00000G3A6,"I didn't remember many of the details about ""Get A Life"" when it was on TV - just that Chris Elliott was a major looser as a 30-year-old paper boy living in a garage. And that it was one of the funniest shows I'd seen in a  long time. So, I ordered the DVD, hoping to recapture the guilty enjoyment  of a twisted comedy that I remembered.
All I can say is: Girlfriend  2000. Oh... My... God!  THAT'S what was so funny about the show! The episode  opens with Chris on his bike, getting plowed down by an SUV. He ends up  falling in love with the driver after she re-sets his mangled legs and  repairs his totaled bike on the spot, and sets out on a stalking spree.  Animotion's ""Obsession"" playing while he follows her around is pure  brilliance.  This is the forth episode, and it's about here where Elliot  really finds his character.
The other three are very good as well,  especially ""Spewy and Me"" which features a projectile-vomiting alien. All  through the show he's throwing up, and it just gets funnier and funnier!  Please Rhino, PLEASE may we have another?",955324800,13,1066,4.455958549222798
