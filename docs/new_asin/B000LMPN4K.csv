8162319,5,B000LMPN4K,"surprisingly enough, this movie has only one thing copied from Mrs. Doubtfire, the theme. The rest of the movie is pulled off with a witty, wacky script (written by Gulzar) and wonderful direction and editing. The second half of the movie is especially very fast and enjoyable. Vishal's music is not so memorable but songs like Chupdi Chupdi Chachi... and Dauda Dauda Bhaagaa.. do go well with yhe film. A must-see film - for its performance and good direction, devoid of routine formula drama.",1301184000,,494,4.892857142857143
