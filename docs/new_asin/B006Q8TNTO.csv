5013274,2,B006Q8TNTO,"First let me start by saying I recently purchased my first Bosch Router and table and have only used it once.
I saw Mark Eaton's videos on YouTube and liked them, especially the one about making doors.
When I saw this on Amazon, I figured I'd like to own a copy.
This video is very, very basic.
In fact, the video on YT for making the doors was more complete than on this video.
The video is missing some very important parts like the best and easiest way to measure out for your cuts.
Also, the video and sound quality are poor at best.
I would have gladly paid twice as much to have had his YT video procedures on this DVD.
My advise is to watch Mark Eaton's videos on YT, but skip this purchase.",1441324800,6,698,4.139705882352941

5013281,5,B006Q8TNTO,"I am new to routing and this DVD was very helpful. The information and demonstrations of using routers are very well presented.
