8329944,5,B0015I2SME,"Dr. John Izzo is a famous Canadian inspirational speaker and author who interviewed 200 people from the age of 60-105. In this presentation he shares what he learned about what gives life true meaning. His mellifluous voice is comforting to listen to. His radiant presence is a joy to observe. His heartfelt message is one that resonates with everyone.

He helps you answer the following questions:

What are you standing up for in the world?
What does the world expect of you?
What are you doing with the life you've been given?
Are you making a difference in the world?
Am I doing what I was born to do?

These are interesting questions to consider. Dr. John Izzo also tells many meaningful stories. While he talks a sand animator (David Myriam) draws interesting pictures that are featured on two big screens. I must say his art adds a subtle energy to the talks and it was enjoyable to observe the art taking shape in real time.

Some of the things that were especially memorable in this presentation was the concept that love is a choice and that we should be ""kindness in every interaction."" Dr. John Izzo also discusses the secret of happiness.

I learned some new things and was reminded of some tried and true things. By viewing these DVDs you will enable yourself to really find out what matters to you. I feel that these talks will be some of the most meaningful you ever witness in this lifetime. I laughed and cried along with the audience. Dr. John Izzo's message will make a difference in your life. Why wait until you are 90 to learn the secrets of a happy life?

This DVD captures his spirit and presence as if the viewer were in the front row, seeing him live.  I have read the book, and I would still recommend the DVD over the book.  The book is exellent as well, but for someone with a true gift for storytelling in person, it is difficult to bring that same level of personality to the page.  The enhancements to the dvd:  the interviews with some of the elders, the visual aids during the presentation, and the reactions of the audience, help to make the DVD experience an unforgettable one.  What I like most about The Five Secrets is that it is a gift to us as a society which no longer has the presence of a council of elders, or in many cases the presence of an elder in the family.  We can learn from the lives of those who have come before us, so that we can in turn have richer, more fulfilling lives RIGHT NOW!",1247097600,8,1013,4.164102564102564
8329946,3,B0015I2SME,"This book is seen to be disconnected at times, because of several stories that do not seem to follow any set pattern.  The stories to me should be centered on the life of fewer characters, then we can use the life of each over a longer period of each facing triumphs and adversities.  Half way through the book I stopped reading as I could not find the five secrets with any clear explanation.",1235692800,,393,4.36986301369863
