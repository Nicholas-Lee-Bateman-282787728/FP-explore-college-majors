Above all the movie represents self worth and true friends will go to the end for you, and they're hard to come by. It was funny and cute. I'd buy it most definitely. But thats my opinion, you have to see it for your self.  Rent it before buying it, that'll be the only way to see if you really want to own the dvd.",1246320000,2,409,4.049382716049383

3847006,5,B0024NSFYO,"Princess Protection Program is a great movie. It has a great storyline and it teaches a lot of VALUABLE moral lessons which a lot of movies do not teach anymore. This movie teaches you about the importance of friendship, being true to yourself, and no matter who you are or where you come from you are always special.

This movie is about a princess Rosalinda (Demi) and she has to go into hiding so she is put into the house with Carter (Selena) and her father. Although Carter doesn't care for Rosalinda at first she learns to deal with her and they both learn a lot from each other including what it takes to be a great friend. This is truly a great movie.

If you are looking for a great movie that the entire family can enjoy I recommend this movie. The Disney Channel has done a great job with this movie especially with the casting of Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato.",1246147200,6,871,4.337423312883436
3847007,5,B0024NSFYO,"What a great movie this was!  Normally from a Disney Channel movie, you wouldn't expect it to be a blockbuster movie, but this movie is one of the best ones that Disney has had in a long time!  Although it doesn't quite beat the Hannah Montana phoenominon, Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato are very talented young ladies.  It even adds on that these two girls are best friends in real life because they have a lot of chemistry together while acting in this movie.  It's a great movie to watch with your girlfriends and fun for the whole family!  There's comedy, romance, and drama.  This movie has almost everything you could ask for and it teaches the moral lesson that you should always be true to yourself, it's okay to let your inner beauty show, don't judge too quicky, and most of all, best friends will always be there for each other and you should never let boys come between that.  This was a very cute movie and I would give it five stars right off the bat!",1243555200,19,963,4.376404494382022

3847017,5,B0024NSFYO,"For fans of Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato, this one makes for a really fun retro watch. I don't think even Disney knew how big these girls were gonna blow up. Princess Protection Program is a Disney Channel Original Movie that first aired in 2009, and its immense rewatch value ensures that it's never kept too long in television purgatory. So, the movie posits the existence of the International Princess Protection Program, a covert operation funded by the world's royal families to safeguard imperiled princesses.

The IPPP has designated 16-year-old Rosalinda Marie Montoya Fiore (Lovato) as Princess #379. Rosalinda is a month away from her coronation as sovereign to the tiny nation of Costa Luna, so tiny it's not even on most maps. But when Costa Luna is invaded by the dictator of the neighboring country of Costa Estrella, Major Joe Mason (Tom Verica) of the IPPP swoops in and spirits away Princess Rosalinda. Separated from her mother, Rosalinda goes with Major Mason to his home in Lake Monroe, Louisiana where she must now go incognito as a normal American school girl.

Being a princess, ""Rosie Gonzalez"" finds it a chore having to blend in. She has grace and a naturally sweet disposition, and she wants to help everyone. Major Mason's tomboy daughter Carter (Gomez) is charged with helping her nibs go undetected, passing her off as her cousin from Iowa. Only, Carter is a wee bit resentful of the princess being there at her home, taking up time with her dad and inadvertently making a bid at becoming the most popular girl in her high school. And when the guy Carter's had a crush on forever starts making dating overtures at Rosie, well, you can't blame her for seeing red. See, Carter is sort of an outsider. She's not popular. It doesn't help that she works at her dad's bait shop. The resident mean girls call her ""bait girl."" The mean girls would stretch that out to ""bait girl and her strangely formal cousin.""

Of course, at some point, Carter and Rosie end up friends. Much of the movie revolves around the impending homecoming dance and who would end up being voted homecoming queen. Mean girl boss Chelsea (Jamie Chung) takes it for granted it'll be her. And, yet, something about Rosie penetrates her self-absorption enough that she feels threatened and so begins messing with Rosie's world. And, never too far away, there's the subplot of what's going on in Rosie's beleaguered kingdom. Maybe - or maybe not - that'll dovetail into the main story arc.

I think Princess Protection Program is a modern classic. If this were back in the day, I could picture Hayley Mills starring in it. If it were earlier in the oughts, it'd be Lindsay Lohan. This movie shines with positive messages about friendship, integrity, grace under pressure, and what constitutes inner beauty. In a refreshing swerve, the romantic thread is bypassed for the sake of further scenes in which the girls' spend more time to explore their friendship. This is one of those cases where neither of the leads outshine the other. Gomez and Lovato work together well and are equally exemplary. It's a family movie thru and thru, with no objectional content and with juuust a taste of that Louisiana flavor. The humor is what you'd expect, broad and harmless. Yeah, I'd recommend this as a really good watch for the pre-teen audience, especially the pre-teen girls. My niece is all over this movie.",1470182400,,3391,4.821305841924398

3847021,3,B0024NSFYO,"Disney makes good family movies.

At the beginning the Princess of a small Island Country, Rosalinda Montoya, was about to be crowned Queen.  Then the ceremony was interrupted by the dictator of another island, General Magnus Kane.  He declared Rosalinda to young to rule and himself president.  Rosalinda was saved by a Major Joe Mason.

As long as the Princess was alive and free, her country had hope.  With Joe's help she assumed the alias of Rosie Gonzalez.  She stays with Joe and his daughter, Carter, hiding out in the American Bayou Country.  Carter was a tomboyish teen girl, not much younger than Rosie.  They fight at first, but end up like Sisters, resulting in an assortment of drama.

Through Carter Rosie learns what is means to be one of the people.  She learns what she'll need to actually be the head of her country.  She learns the difference between Ruling and Leading.  Carter learns what Royalty are supposed to be.  She learns to be confident, and controlled.  To have strength to spare.  Rosie showed Carter how beautiful she was on the inside and helped her become as beautiful on the outside.

The finale has Carter luring Magnus Kane to the U.S.  Letting him believe he could capture Rosie.  In his country that would be legal.  In the U.S. it was still kidnapping, and he didn't have Diplomatic Immunity.  The ending had Carter and Joe attending the coronation of Queen Rosalinda.",1462665600,,1409,4.763485477178423

Wnen tried  to get Amazon to replace it, they wanted me ship it back.  It was too much of a hassle for me waste my time finding a place to ship it (for the low cost of the dvd, I just took the loss).  And Amazon refused to replace any other way.  SO MUCH FOR AMAZON'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!  I would like to see the movie, won't risk buying, with shipping for one item, and that maybe not working, Amazon wanting me to take that loss again.  Frankly, I think they to take a look at their way to handle such cases.  I hope they don't treat other good customers like they did me!

There are lots of things that I love about this movie: 1. The cast, especially Selena Gomez & Demi Lovato (those two actresses work well together and play their characters to perfection), 2. The plot, where Lovato's character is about to be crowned Queen of her country, Costa Luna, however, a month before the coronation, the palace gets attacked.  Fortunately, agents from the Princess Protection Program (PPP) are at the scene and they rescue the princess and take out the attacker's henchmen in the process, but they leave behind the Queen and she gets taken as a hostage. Then, at PPP headquarters, the princess goes through 4 stages: 1. Extraction, which brought her there, 2. Transition which leads to stage 3. Transformation, where she gets a new name, Rosie Gonzalez, a new hairstyle & wardrobe, then, finally, stage 4. Relocation, so that nobody can know where to find her and that place is rural Louisiana, where she will live with the agent who rescued her and his daughter, Carter, played by Selena Gomez. However, Carter shows hostility toward Rosie until Rosie explains her situation, the two become best friends, then Carter shows Rosie how to be normal instead of royal and, in return, Rosie shows Carter how to reveal her inner princess. Lastly, I like the 4 lessons that are taught in the movie: 1. Always be true to yourself, 2. It's okay to let your inner beauty show, 3. Don't judge too quickly and 4. Best friends will always be there when they need each other. So, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Selena Gomez/Demi Lovato or is in the mood for a good Disney movie because, believe me, it is WONDERFUL!!!",1373673600,,1807,4.700315457413249

3847183,2,B0024NSFYO,"Positives:
(1.) Disney uses films' 70 year old time worn formula of selling fantasy princess cuteness world to girls under 16 to make Disney more money.
(2.) Use lots of cute people doing a lot of shopping acting dumb & mean (to provide something that resembles a conflict so we can have a story).
(3.) Being decent always wins in Disney World & mean people disappear.
Negatives:
(1.) Disney TV/movies (and other studios) have a greater educational impact than schools and family.
(2.) Disney audience will grow up unthinking in cliches & stereotypes which are as realistic as fantasy princess world.",1251590400,5,600,4.9504950495049505
3847194,5,B0024NSFYO,"Ah yes, Princess Protection Program (a.k.a. PPP).  First, let me say that nobody is too old to appreciate the teen nuances of this film because you never truly forget what it was like to be a teenager.  And apparently things really haven't changed all that much from the early 90's.  But I digress.

  Let me truly begin by saying that I absolutely loved this movie!  Being a big fan of both Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato, I first heard about this movie eight months before it was ever released, and man, what a long wait for its eventual release on television. Because it's an original Disney Channel movie, I didn't expect anything spectacular like Shrek.  By contrast, when the Sci-Fi channel releases one of their original movies, you are guaranteed it's going to be low-budget CGI crap.  Those movies are viewable only if you're intoxicated AND Stephen Baldwin is not the main character.  The Disney Channel, on the other hand, puts out some pretty good original movies from time to time.  This movie was a delightful surprise in all of its simplicity and refreshing new faces.

  The first ten minutes of the movie highlight the brief visual backgrounds of the two lead actresses in the movies.  Clearly we see that they are from two entirely different worlds (or countries, in this case).  To make a long story short, Princess Rosalinda (Lovato) must flee her country under duress and blend in as an American teenager in the bayou of Louisiana while living with the teenage daughter (Gomez) of the man who rescued her from her country.  Selena Gomez plays an adorable tomboy working in her father's bait shop, and as always, she's as cute as a button.

The natural progression of the first few dramatic scenes was fairly predictable from the beginning, but I'm sure that's what the audience expected anyway.  Initially, the princess and Selena Gomez's character clash like two cats crossing each others' paths.  It must be human nature for two teenage girls, total strangers to one another, to dislike each other before eventually becoming friends - predictable, but expected.

  As high and royal as the princess is portrayed, I found her to be my absolute favorite character in the film.  She has such a good heart and ultimately means well as she tries to blend in as a typical American high school student.  As we all know or remember, there's always drama in high school.  On a different note, I've seen this movie close to thirty times primarily for the sake of checking out Demi Lovato's big brown eyes and really cute cleft chin.  She's a dollface any way you look at it.  She plays an awesome princess possessing physical beauty, headstrong morals, and a sense of altruism.

  Don't focus too hard on the believability of the film or some of its characters.  It's pure fantasy and simply written to keep older viewers young at heart and younger viewers intrigued with that `what's going to happen next?' mentality.  So kick back with your children (if you've got some) and enjoy this charming G-rated movie.",1248134400,2,3022,4.794573643410852
3847195,5,B0024NSFYO,"This is a very great movie. This two ladies proved that they can act by doing complete different charaters than they ususaly do. un like the Jonas brothers that cant do anything but the ""rockstar"" roll.

3847196,3,B0024NSFYO,"The movie is forgettable, I mean what can you expect, it has like a weird supporting cast, but Lovato and Gomez save the day.  They are really cute in this flick.  It's like, a snapshot of their cuteage era, as this was shot like back in 2008 and they are now more mature looking.  So it is a memento I guess.

The scene in the lunchroom sums up the cuteage.  I like it when Selena is teaching Demi how to eat a burger and it is just a cute scene, the way they look, the acting, everything.  It is priceless.

Oh yeah, the bonus features are ok, I'm kinda disappointed though, because it stated that one of them is about Lovato and Gomez, but actually it is more of a behind the scenes with the rest of the cast as well.  That one can be skipped.  The music video on the other hand, is worth it.  What a cool song.  Of course the girls look different in the video as it was just shot this year, and it is interesting to compare their current looks to the year-old movie clips.

Anyways, I recommend this flick.  A must have.",1247788800,,1024,4.111111111111111
3847197,4,B0024NSFYO,"Two promising young stars turn this boilerplate Disney Channel movie into a decent diversion for `tween girls. A funny story of a princess and tomboy who join together to battle various high school horrors, it also includes a nice message about self-esteem.

Selena Gomez (""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wizards-of-Waverly-Place/dp/B0018CWEU8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wizards of Waverly Place</a>"") shines in her first starring role, with comic sensibilities that hint at a long career.

Also worth mentioning is another newcomer, Jamie Chung, who MTV viewers will remember from ""The Real World: San Diego."" She plays Chelsea, the front-runner for homecoming queen.

Girls between the ages of say, 7 to 13, should love it. If you buy it for one, you'll score bonus brownie points by telling her that the Jonas Brothers co-wrote one of the featured songs, ""Two Worlds Collide.""",1247702400,15,1188,6.465408805031447
3847198,4,B0024NSFYO,"Princess Protection Program doesn't really have to have a story, as long as there's a shopping scene set to hot music, a wacky mess scene, a mismatched pair that get to like each other and a not-too-hazardous denoument where girl power saves the day. Add the standard heroic, handsome dad (but only attractive in an ""old people"" way 'cause otherwise it would be ewwww), assorted mean girls and cute boys, shake well and you have a hit for the J-14 market. To paraphrase Carly Simon, nobody does it better than Disney Channel.

Sally Field-ish sprite Demi Lovato (please someone do a remake of The Flying Nun with this young star!) and snappy but not too caustic Selena Gomez stay true to the onscreen personas established by their respective TV series, though one wonders why they didn't mix things up a little by having Lovato play the eye-rolling American tween and Gomez play the affected princess, who doesn't use contractions much like Barbara Eden did on I Dream Of Jeannie (""Master, are you not pleased?"" ""Major Healey, do you not think my master would like me to blink an elephant into his office?"")

It's still grand movie matinee fun that stretches logic and story sense with the same el&aacute;n that The Monkey's Uncle did for Annette Funicello and Tommy Kirk. You never worry for a minute about anyone being in serious danger and the biggest hazard besides snarky rival girls is yogurt. My daughter loved it, so case closed.

The DVD does not include too much that we didn't see on Disney Channel interstitials, including the ""aren't we the best of friends"" segment that was brought to fever pitch on premiere night when the two BFFs hosted the movie and had oh-so-much fun.

3847199,4,B0024NSFYO,"On June 30th, the televised movie ""PRINCESS PROTECTION PROGRAM"" (which airs on the Disney Channel on June 26th) brings together real-life BFF's Selena Gomez (""Wizards of Waverly Place"") and Demi Lovato (""Camp Rock"") together in a film directed by Allison Liddi (has directed for TV shows such as ""Bones"", ""Friday Night Lights"", ""Gossip Girl"", ""Chuck"" and ""Grey's Anatomy"") and a screenplay by Annie DeYoung (writer for ""Prince William"", ""The Facts of Life Reunion"" and ""The Ron Clark Story"").

Joining both Gomez and Lovato are Tom Verica (""Flags of Our Fathers"", ""The Nine"" and ""American Dreams""),  actress Jamie Chung (""Samurai Girl"", ""Greek"" and ""Days of Our Lives"") and Molly Hagan (""Unfabulous"").

The film revolves around two girls from two different countries and very different upbringing.

Carter Mason (Selena Gomez) works at a bait shop in Louisiana with her father (Tom Verica) who is also employed as an agent of the Princess Protection Program.  For Carter, she is often treated badly because she doesn't sport the expensive clothes and the lifestyle of Chelsea (Jamie Chung) and her friends.  She likes Donnie (Robert Adamson) but he never recognizes her.

The other girl is Rosalinda (Demi Lovato) who is about to become the queen of Costa Luna.  But since the death of her father, there has been an uprising and General Magnus Kane has staged a coup and takes over Costa Luna.  Sophia's mother knows that General Kane can't take power as long as her daughter is alive and fortunately, she has the help of the Princess Protection Program to watch her daughter.

The program is funded by the royalty to protect the princess throughout the world and Carter Mason's father who works for the program is ordered to take Princess Rosalinda and bring her to an undisclosed location.  As long as Rosalinda is alive and well, General Kane will be unable to hurt her mother or take control of Costa Luna.

But life is tough for both teenage girls.  Carter dislikes girls who act like a ""princess"" and think they deserve attention and Rosalinda, is having difficulties fitting in because she is a princess.  And to make things more challenging, Carter's father wants her to attend the local high school and Carter to help her achieve this normal life and not draw any suspicion that she is a real life princess.

But when all the guys start diverting their attention to Rosalinda and the high school students start thinking Rosalinda is very cool, Carter becomes jealous.  But Rosalinda does what she can to make her relationship better with Carter but plans keep backfiring.  Will these two girls with different lifestyles ever get along?  And will Rosalinda ever be able to return to Costa Luna and free her mother and the people of the country?

JUDGMENT CALL:

Both Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato have a good chemistry with each other and the fact the two are best friends (and have known each other since they were children) and are comfortable being around with each other, their enthusiasm can be seen onscreen.  In fact, all the talent seemed to have gelled quite well (according to the talents, because there was only a handful of them, they were all able to hang out and have fun offscreen and onscreen) onscreen and everything seems to work.

Personally, these two young actresses do a great job.  For one, I'm proud to see two actresses with Latino heritage in starring roles in a film and most of all, to finally seeing these two stars working together.  Personally, I find it absolutely awesome that Disney has been giving people of different ethnicities the opportunity to have major lead roles in their films and ""PRINCESS PROTECTION PROGRAM"" is no different.

Overall, ""PRINCESS PROTECTION PROGRAM"" is enjoyable, very safe for children and an enjoyable film for the whole family.  If you are a fan of both Gomez or Lovato or both, definitely check this film out!",1246665600,3,5294,4.94563986409966
