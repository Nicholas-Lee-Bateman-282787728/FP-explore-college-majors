Let it be known that this movie and the others in the series are NOT FOR KIDS. You really should be about 18 to watch this thing,  because it's chock full of graphic sex and profanity.  The other reviewer  says that the sex in this particular one isn't as graphic as the previous  episodes, but it was plenty graphic for me! I expected this from the  warning on the box, but I had no idea it would be so bad!
The entire  movie is about innocent young girls being raped and turned into sex slaves  by a nurse with a plant that feeds itself from these captured girls (use  your imagination, I won't go into details.) Not a particularly intelligent  plot, just a big hentai (anime porn) fest. You realize as the whole thing  progresses that every single one of these women are essentially being  raped, and I actually started to feel sorry for them towards the end. It's  like a focus on the darker side of sexual desires. I was expecting a little  more on the plot side, but I was mistaken.
I can't think of any real  reason to watch this movie a second time, other than for pure shock factor.  I'm sure there is good erotic anime out there, but this is too dark and  evil to be considered ""erotic"" in my opinion. In two words: Dark  Hentai. Stay away from this movie.",954806400,2,1349,4.2896825396825395
