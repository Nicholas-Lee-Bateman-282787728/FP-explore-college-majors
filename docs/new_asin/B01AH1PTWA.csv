8747359,4,B01AH1PTWA,"Coming out in 1971 this film shocked the world and is still jarring to viewers today.  This adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novel of a dystopian future is a great lesson in the abuse of technology to achieve some ""good"" which original intentions are backed by hypocritical and selfish goals that leads to spectacular failure resonates even today.  This steelbook release from Denmark is handsome as is what one would expect from such a release although the picture and sound quality represent no obvious improvement over the plain vanilla blu ray release and is not too much of an improvement over the upscaled standard dvd release.  If you are a steelbook collector you would probably be more interested in this release.  For the rest I'm not sure this is worth the ""upgrade"".  If you don't already have this film go ahead and add this to your film library as an outstanding example of the great Stanley Kubrick's directorial genius.",1510272000,,933,4.879746835443038
