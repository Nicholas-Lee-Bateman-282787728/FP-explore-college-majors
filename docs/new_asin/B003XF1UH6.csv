8408044,3,B003XF1UH6,I AM A FAN OF THE BUSTER CRABBE WESTERNS..ESPECIALLY HIS BILLY THE KID SERIES WITH AL ST JOHN..THIS TILE WAS A NEW ONE FOR ME .. IT IS A TYPICAL MOVIE OF THAT GENRE...WITH A LITTLE MORE SLAPSTICK COMEDY...AND A VERY SIMILIAR SET FROM THE BORDER BADMEN MOVIE...ALL IN ALL IF YOU LIKE THE PRC BUSTER CRABBE MOVIES YOU WILL LOVE IT ...THANKS STEVE ONEIL,1312761600,,350,4.4
