5847257,5,B00DQ6S5S4,"This is a very good movie about how we, as Christians, can handle grief. I've lost my only son, my youngest daughter and their mother all within 18 months. It's only through the HOPE and PROMISE of the Good News of Jesus that I could have survived. Life is for the living and God want us to live it abundantly and that can only be on the reliance of his Word.

Thank you for making this movie about something we will all face one day, grief.",1389225600,16,441,4.127906976744186
5847258,5,B00DQ6S5S4,"Synopsis:
""Hope for Hurting Hearts"" tells the true stories of how Greg and Cathe Laurie, Jeremy Camp, and Nick Vujicic stood at a ""spiritual crossroads"" marked by challenging and painful circumstances, and how each chose the road of trusting, following, and glorifying God.

Dove Worldview:
This is a DVD that will touch anyone who watches it! It is about pain and suffering and who in life hasn't been touched by those things? In this quality production we hear stories and testimonies by people who have been touched by pain, such as Christian singer Jeremy Camp, who married his wife Melissa despite her battle with cancer and how he dealt with the pain of the experience. We learn the story of Greg and Cathe Laurie, who lost their son Christopher to a car accident, not long after the birth of his child. We also learn of Nick Vujicic, who was born without arms or legs. Despite the tragedies each of these people faced, everyone has an amazing story of where the journey ended up after they held on to their hope and faith in God. They each talk about how God is with us in the pain.

This film, although touching on life's pains and difficult moments, also focuses on what holding on to hope and looking to Christ can do. We are recommending it for ages twelve plus, due to the sophisticated theme, and the scene of a girl cutting herself although just a trickle of blood is shown on her arm. There is also a girl who is seen reaching for drugs of some sort and we see briefly that she is high but the scene is not graphic and is used to make a point that some people turn to drugs during painful times in their lives. We strongly recommend this DVD. It can actually be life changing and should be utilized as a tool to minister to those who are hurting. This one has earned our highest rating, five Doves. Don't miss ""Hope for Hurting Hearts""! It's remarkable.

Laurie when she was talking about the loss of their son Christopher in an accident  a few years ago. The movie  use little vignettes of people in different crisis in their lives, to dramatize how God meets us in our pain. I would recommend this movie to everyone...even those not yet faced with trials. It will help them prepare. A good follow up movie is called Acts of God..the story of seven lives faced with the question 'Why, God??""",1408752000,2,559,4.742268041237113
