5883231,4,B00E1HIX5M,"I will just say that this is one of those classic old slasher films from 1981. If you have seen the more current one? then let me just clue you in to one thing, there are different resolutions. I will not say much more except, put up with the bad characters and the mostly bad acting and just ride the wave back to the 80's.",1430438400,2,324,4.0

8600049,4,B00E1HIX5M,1980SHORROR really good. the remake is really bad,1457222400,,49,5.25
8600050,3,B00E1HIX5M,Great movie. Heard about this when the remake came out. Finally watched it online after finding one with good quality. Others I found had it sped up to try to avoid copyright. Would've given it 4 stars but had to deduct 1 do to this being edited. Some of the deaths weren't shown how they were from the video I saw. Like that bartender getting a pickax through his chin and it going out his left eye or the one girl getting a shower head impaled through the back of her head.,1453420800,,475,4.173913043478261
