4709438,1,B005IGVTM4,"The other 2 reviews are a bit off-track given the product in question. Taking it out and blasting it with a shotgun? While not a bad idea, it doesn't explain the urge to destroy the DVD. The review that recommends the film...did they even see the same film?

The basic events of the film are woman moves into rough neighborhood, tries to fend off unwanted attention and gets abused and raped. The ""revenge"" scenes are pure fantasy and zip past in a few minutes and were most likely thrown in to equate this film as an urban ""I Spit On Your Grave"".

The simple subject matter alone makes this film vile for most people. That is the nature of transgressive cinema. These films take you places that violate taboos, morals and basic human dignity. In the course of such films, viewers may face circumstances beyond their day to day experiences and determine how such horrific scenes affect them. If this film had only stopped there, one could easily dismiss it as merely pathetic.

""They All Must Die!"" goes a step beyond and makes itself a vehicle of perverted, racist propaganda that leaves me wondering if the African-American actors knew the final intent of the film. Bad enough that you are treated to endless scenes portraying the black characters as self-obsessed, instant gratification cretins who spew racial insults at the drop of a hat. Once the actual violence against the white female begins, most viewers will notice an occasional flash on the screen. What these ""flashes"" happen to be are archival photos of actual lynchings of African-Americans, usually with crowds of white people smiling over the beaten, broken, burning bodies of the blacks they just murdered.

Freedom of speech? Fine. I'll grant it protection under that, but does not keep it from being offensive and sickening. And I just cannot help but believe the people in this film had no true idea what they were participating in. That these people took part in film that condemns their race as animals who deserve nothing more than death is perhaps the saddest thing next the film itself.",1337904000,10,2063,4.8192090395480225
4709439,1,B005IGVTM4,"I didn't want to write a review on this piece of garbage, because I didn't want anyone to know I was suckered in to buying this.  Its a F A K E video, and the whole movie stinks.  BANNED, ya! right for false advertising.  Don't even bother to rent this.  You won't miss the dollar rental as much as your lost time.  Not even good enough to fast forward to check out the SKANKS rape seen. (fake of course).  I keep disks like this for summer, and add them in to my skeet supplies.  I get a very satisfying smile on my face every time one of these silvery disk flies into hundreds of pieces when shot by a 12 gauge shotgun.  PS 4 stars must be new to horror films. Or has a financial interest in this stinker.  What he tells you about the movie is correct enough.  His thin white girl, is a 2 am skank, and you are wondering crab's? or clap? And am I really drunk enough, and do I have some extra strong condums.",1333152000,3,910,4.033519553072626
4709440,4,B005IGVTM4,"First, let me say this is not for those people who dislike watching a woman being raped. This movie has one of the most brutal rape seens ever put on film. It is also quite long. Next;  young, thin white woman rents an apt. in the N.Y. getto to get material for her journalist paper. The only white girl for blocks around! Soon three guys rape her in her apt. Afterwards, she does not call police or move out. Instead she figures that revenge and payback will make her feel better! Dead male bodies start to accumulate. Now, I've watched the movie ""Thriller"", which is of a similar plot. This movie blows that one away. Now, for the down side; the pictue is somewhat fuzzy, and I have an 1080p tv. Once the ""action"" starts, you tend not to notice the fuzzy. The movie abruptly ends. It was like the last few minutes got lost over the past 13 years, no explanation. There are no actors names given, or anybody elses name either. There is no Root Menue, no special features, nothing, just the movie. Some of the conversations are pretty interesting, while others are boring or stupid. The acting wasn't very good, although the girl was very belevable while being raped. The dvd disc and case art lead one to believe this was filmed in 1998, then wasn't released until 2011. The movie feels to me like an early '80s or '70s made film. This movie script has alot of stuff that would not get past the cutting room floor today. Both racist and politically incorrect. There is full female nudity, with no real male nudity, maybe a butt shot or two. Plenty of violence but nothing over the top. No gore that I can recall. So, if you are a bit fragile, don't watch this movie. The rape scene alone would rate 5 stars, but the fuzzy picture,abrupt ending made me subtract! Also, I think the girls great acting during the rape, is what caused the NYPD to investigate this film. You gotta see it for yourself!",1330732800,33,1897,4.435530085959885

There is so much foul language in this movie that I had to put this aptly where it belongs, IN THE TRASH!  Could only stand about 15 minutes of this garbage.  So stay faaaaaaaaaarrrrr aaawaaaaayyyy from this putrescent vomit feast.  There is no story line except the rape and mutilation of the unwitting girl.

4709448,5,B005IGVTM4,"My favorite Sean Weathers film is a take off of I Spit on your Grave with an urban twist. Banned, hmm i am not sure about that but is it a fun film hell yes. The story goes as followed, a very very very annoying crack head writher moves to the big city to wright a book about urban life, we really don't get too much of an idea of what she is writhing about but she just seems way over her head. Not capable of being nicest to anyone she is quickly teased tormented and later raped. You kinda don't feel bad for her because she is so unlikable and her constant screaming in this cracked out voice makes you want the guys to just shut her up but she gets the last say, by hunting her attackers down and doing what she needs to do. All in all i recommend this film, its allot of fun for a no budget little Last house node and hell, wear else do you get to see a film wear you side so heavily with the villains  .",1417478400,2,910,3.89247311827957

4709457,4,B005IGVTM4,"Low budget, sleazy, grimy looking film. The look, feel, cast, camera work, video quality and length of the rape scene all add up for very uncomfortable viewing. If you're looking for a disturbing film this is it.",1391472000,5,212,4.756756756756757
4709458,5,B005IGVTM4,"I see a lot of polarizing comments about this film, yes the video quality isn't great, but it's a low budget film made in the 90s what are you expecting? I don't disagree with any of the positive or negative comments I've read about this film, I just like it for the same reason the people that like it do and I like it for the same reason that people hate it do. I love the ending, I love the lynching stills. I think the low budget feel also adds to the realism of the movie as a whole and I thought the rape scene was very well done. I don't see how you could ask for more out it, unless you want to see an actual rape? The rape is the reason I bought the film and the scene delivered. Again I don't want to come off saying this is a great film, but when you promise and you deliver, I got no complaints.",1391472000,5,807,3.896969696969697

If not then someone's really dumb and obviously hasn't watched this movie. Again, I don't really know what to say about this one other than the picture quality sucked. Maybe you should just watch it for yourself.",1387238400,,357,4.59375
4709461,3,B005IGVTM4,"How often do you see a home movie or any B-Movie in (((WIDESCREEN))) format? Never! So with this being done in widescreen and having good audio, and good camera shots, and good editing, and given the fact it was done like an amateurely produced film (avoiding genitalia camera shots of both sexes completely as if trying to earn an R film rating) because it has a 1998 copyright (showing it was made before internet high speed connections existed and therefore the maker of the film probably knew nothing about how to be more extreme with nudity, sex, violence, and subject content with a true unrated film), I would say it's good enough to watch for the nudity of the white chick, but you never see her crotch, so this film is not really unrated, it actually passes for an R rating instead.

The picture quality is very blurry and grainy, especially for the first part of the film, so when they first show the white girl, all you see is a blur or a smudge on the screen rather than the details of her body. Video quality appears to get better when they film indoors, probably because they are closer to the camera.

There is no violence in this film! It's a low budget film, so the most violence you see is a few people punching the palm of their own hand, pretending they hit someone, or holding things in view of the camera (like the iron) and not actually doing anything with them. It would have been nice to see them at least try some kind of special effects.

The only problem I really had with this film is how sloppy the scripts were once the attack started. It pretty much started with someone saying something stupid and then repeating it non-stop for about forty-five minutes, which could only be from not having any script prepared. So it might be best to just turn off the audio at that point and then have your friends talk over the movie to speak for the actors.

Also, the film is only 75 minutes long, not 85 minutes!",1382486400,5,1934,4.424157303370786

4709464,4,B005IGVTM4,Even though it wasn't as brutal as I except it was still shocking enough to appease me. Even though it has racial undertones this film is primarily about the dark side of people! Totally worth checking out with an interesting twist at the end!,1373328000,5,243,4.545454545454546
