3557858,4,B001EX9YOA,"If you are looking for a fun, quirky, feel-good, indie comedy then Little Big Top is right up your alley.  You'll recognize a few of the bigger actors, including the dude from Greek, as well as the guy from Office Space, and finally Sid Haig.  Haig usually does the horror thing, but he really pulls the clown gig off in this one, becoming a buffoon and a funny grump all in the same role.",1262563200,2,389,4.243243243243243
3557859,5,B001EX9YOA,"This great independant movie stars both Sid Haig and Richard Riehle. I've always been a big fan of both these actors and really enjoyed seeing them togeather in this movie. Sid Haig plays an alcoholic clown who returns to his hometown, and somewhat unwillingly, turns his life around with some help from his friends. Little Big Top is a movie with a heart which I thoroughly enjoyed!",1262131200,2,383,4.731343283582089

3557861,5,B001EX9YOA,"The laughs and lessons 'Little Big Top' seeks to impart do not hit you in the face, but rather percolate just below a richly crafted and deliberate surface. As the story proceeds, they pop their heads up for moments at a time, until by the end of the movie, you cannot help but laugh at, with, and learn from, lead clown Seymour Smiles and his beer-laden, snow-cone-sipping journey of self-discovery. A grade-A thinking man's film you will want to watch over and over again. Check it out!",1261872000,2,488,4.620689655172414
3557862,5,B001EX9YOA,"Having grown up in the Circus City, I was extremely interested in this film.  Great film.  Gives a good view of Peru, its people, area and the love the town has for its history with the circus.  It really is filmed in Peru and it is a really nice story, as well.
Well done.  Watch this film, more than once.",1231718400,5,307,4.066666666666666
3557863,3,B001EX9YOA,"The reason Peru, Indiana has so many clowns is there are no JOBS
Peru,Indiana has the Highest unemployment of any county in middle
Indiana and has since the late 1980s.
No-one works so were all CLOWNS",1226793600,,200,4.583333333333333
3557864,4,B001EX9YOA,"Seymour Smiles (Sid Haig, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" and ""House of 1000 Corpses""), an aging ex-clown in his 50's, arrives back in his hometown of Peru, Indiana content to live out the rest of his days alone in a drunken stupor.

The problem? This IS Peru, Indiana. In Peru, Indiana clowns aren't just funny people you watch once a year when the circus comes to town...clowning is a way of life in this small Indiana town.

And in this town that takes clowning so seriously Seymour Smiles is not only a legend himself, he's the son and the grandson of clowning legends Miles O'Smiles and Sonny Smiles. When Seymour Smiles returns to town, drunken stupor or not, he gets noticed...quickly.

It's not long before his childhood friend, Bob Patterson (Richard Riehle of ""Office Space""), is at his doorstep and convinces Seymour to join the local amateur circus and lead their ragtag team of clowns.

Seymour isn't really interested in leading a bunch of amateur clowns, and he's even less interested in sobering up long enough to do so. Finally, Seymour is booted out by a no-nonsense Head Trainer (Hollis Resnik) and, almost simultaneously, loses his home to foreclosure. One night, broke and homeless, Seymour finds himself hiding in the circus arena in his small town. It's in the midst of this despair that Seymour first hides, then watches the local circus amateurs in practice and then, finally, rediscovers his own long lost passion for clowning.

Several apologies and a whole lot of humble pie later, Seymour Smiles is back under the big top...sober, sensitive and, well, smiling.

""Little Big Top,"" written and directed by Ward Roberts (""The Boy Scout""), is the sort of film that makes small town folks smile. It's funny, without being condescending and familiar without being patronizing. In ""Little Big Top,"" Ward Roberts has created a world that feels familiar because it's filled with your next door neighbors, your liquor store clerk, your local grocery store cashier and your local drunk who always makes you laugh affectionately. As irascible as Seymour can be at times, Roberts knows the truth about small town folks like Seymour...they may drive us crazy, but we love them.

The film's intimate direction and production design can be both inviting and distracting. When Seymour reveals that he wants to rehearse his own act after hours because he doesn't like to be watched, its as if the entire production design of ""Little Big Top"" shifts course. Suddenly, camera shots fade away, lighting dims and there's a distance between us, the audience, and this clown who is trying desperately to find his smile again. At times, this distance is uncomfortable as a viewer...yet, it feels like an intentional decision that, ultimately, makes the viewing experience more powerful because we, the viewers, are experiencing Seymour's discomfort right alongside him. It's a subtle, amazingly insightful touch by Roberts.

As Seymour, Sid Haig creates a character unlike any he has ever created onscreen. Long recognized for his ability to bring to life the quirkiest, weirdest, sickest and darkest characters in contemporary cinema, here Haig blends touches of dark, quirky, weird and, unexpectedly, downright sweet. Capitalizing on the abstract character development of Roberts' script, Haig has created one of 2006's most memorable characters. What could have been a simple, loud and histrionic caricature instead becomes the image of a man who has either been broken or broken himself, who can be simultaneously hateful and hopeful. Haig, with uncommon tenderness, underplays Seymour with the seeming awareness that Seymour's woundedness has done more than take him out of the ring...it has taken him out of life.

The rest of the supporting cast provides a perfect complement to the emotional chaos of Seymour. As Bob Patterson, Richard Riehle offers his usual strong, sympathetic performance, while Hollis Resnik's Aggie is a delightful blend of gruff and compassion. While the team of clowns largely plays as an ensemble, Jacob Zachar, as the eager Ernest, shines in a supporting role.

As Seymour's journey towards rediscovering his smile begins to wind down, it goes without saying that he will have to once again face his fears, his anxieties and his alcohol. By the time Seymour arrives at opening night having to choose between a life of drunken fear or a return to the little big top, Seymour has become that close friend you just hope and pray is back on the path to happiness.

It is this last closing shot of Seymour where the film ends and Roberts chooses to focus almost solely on the entire focus of ""Little Big Top""...Seymour's smile. While the shot itself feels a tad abrupt, the shot is perfect in the way that the entire film doesn't come down to small town Peru, clowning or anyone else...it is all about this journey that has led to the return of Seymour's smile.

Production design for ""Little Big Top"" is simple, yet effective throughout the film, with a particularly strong score that companions the film. Roberts' use of abrupt scene cuts makes the film's ending just a touch confusing, an observation that was shared by multiple individuals during the film's screening at the 2006 Heartland Film Festival.
Clown enthusiasts can also rejoice in that relatives of famed clowns Emmett Kelly and Emmett Kelly, Jr. appear in ""Little Big Top,"" and those familiar with the real Peru Circus will recognize some cast members as members of the actual Peru Circus.

""Little Big Top"" is a lot like Seymour Smiles. It's a smile-inducing film that makes you smile, occasionally rubs you the wrong way and, through it all, warms your heart and captures a precious, truly innocent slice of life.",1226448000,8,5703,5.022222222222222
3557865,5,B001EX9YOA,"This movie is great! If you are a Sid haig fan, or like cheesy movies, this one will become your new ""cult"" favorite.",1357862400,,117,4.130434782608695
3557866,5,B001EX9YOA,Little Big Top is an original indedpendent film - the kind you can't see at the multiplexes.  The subtlety and character development is astounding and it's also a lot of fun.  You need to check this movie out!,1269734400,,209,4.473684210526316

3557868,5,B001EX9YOA,Little Big Top is an excellent film.  The casting is great.  The use of a small town in Indiana gives it an extra enticement.  Anyone seeing the film and relate to the chararcter and furthermore see a piece of Americana that makes the film personable.,1263945600,,251,4.533333333333333
3557869,4,B001EX9YOA,"Let's be honest, indie films can really suck.  Whether they're produced by an ""art house"" of a big studio or out of the pocket of some wannabe, the final product often feels clunky and incredibly self indulgent.  Little Big Top, on the other hand, manages to avoid these pitfalls.  While it's not without its problems, LBT tells the story of a twisted Pagliacci in small town Indiana.  The story is captivating, the performances are honest, and the direction is pure in spirit.  I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone whose ever felt a little ""different.""  Four Stars for LBT!",1263945600,,597,4.747572815533981
3557870,5,B001EX9YOA,"I loved the fact that this movie was ACTUALLY shot in Peru, IN and really gave you a feel for the town and how they feel about THEIR circus.  This was a fun movie to watch and I have recommended it to many.",1263945600,,206,3.7906976744186047
3557871,4,B001EX9YOA,"I watched this at a friend's house the other night and was surprised how much I enjoyed it.  I decided it needed to be part of my DVD library and that the good people of Amazon needed to know just how good it was.  I love a movie where you can equally like and dislike the main character, and that happened here.  It's just a nice, heartwarming film and I'm glad I happened upon it.",1263945600,,382,4.066666666666666
3557872,4,B001EX9YOA,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! From start to finish it had my attention. Characters were deep and compelling, ones you root for and yell at, not flat and one-dimensional like so many mainstream flicks now-a-days. Recommend!",1263945600,,225,5.277777777777778
3557873,5,B001EX9YOA,"What a fantastic film! This is the type of movie that you will love... and, the type of movie the whole family will enjoy and will certainly go home with a good message that will last a lifetime! Great job!

3557874,4,B001EX9YOA,"This flick had a big ol' heart.  Good mix of dramedy and comma.  Shows small towns with an honest, but not pretentious or condescending, eye.  Check it out and have a laugh with Sid Haig as a clown on his luck... um... wow, that horrible pun totally derailed me.  But see it.",1263945600,,275,4.230769230769231
3557878,5,B001EX9YOA,Being a huge fan of the baby eaters on youtube i knew i HAD to watch Little Big Top.  Knowing nothing about the industry of clowns i still found it very funny and was very entertained the whole time!,1263859200,,199,4.102564102564102
3557879,4,B001EX9YOA,Really enjoyed this film - fully produced in the Midwest but will be thoroughly enjoyed by all filmlovers from all regions.  Impressive comedic performances from this talented cast.  Enjoy!,1263859200,,189,5.482758620689655
3557880,4,B001EX9YOA,"Charming film about a small town circus and the healing powers of friends and redemption. I especially liked seeing one of my favorite character actors Richard Riehle who's been in Glory,Boston Legal,West Wing and many others. He's the dude with a bushy moustache. Did not know of Sid Haig, but saw him in an old flick once,maybe Shaft. He usually does horror films and he does a great job in playing aginst type in this movie. The movie is short in dialogue but warm characters make this a nice movie. I enjoyed it.",1263859200,,516,4.559139784946237
3557881,5,B001EX9YOA,"This is one of my all time favorites...for me it approaches cult status.  Must be watched several times to pick up on some of the nuances.  It would have been very easy to go over the top and make this movie blue with obsentites, but not a single swear word can be found making this a great movie for a wide age range!",1263859200,3,318,4.031746031746032
3557882,4,B001EX9YOA,"I didn't know what to expect when a friend invited me to see this movie, circus?, clowns?, alright...well it is thoroughly engaging, so sweet, funny, and charming. Apparently the director/Writer, Ward Roberts, grew up in this odd little town in Indiana, and it is a lovely homage to a dying art. Sid Haig is fantastic and the closing scene kills me! Watch it!",1263859200,,359,4.714285714285714
3557883,5,B001EX9YOA,"Little Big Top is a heartfelt film with interesting, quirky and laughter inspiring characters - not all of whom wear red noses and clown shoes.  Sid Haig gives a great performance as a cranky, down on his luck clown Seymour Smiles who turns his life around and ultimately becomes the man (and clown) he was meant to be.  The town of Peru, Indiana provides a perfect backdrop for Seymour's story, adding an indefinable character all it's own, yet somehow inviting and familiar.  Little Big Top is a well crafted and entertaining story with a message for all that will definitely leave you smiling.",1262822400,,596,4.766990291262136
3557884,4,B001EX9YOA,"Little Big Top is both heart-breaking and heart-warming and kept me engaged from beginning to end.  I cared about the characters from the onset, especially Seymour (Sid Haig), even though he was seriously flawed. I tend to favor shows that provide conflict resolutions and happy endings. While Little Big Top didn't have a 'happy ever after' conclusion, I got the emotional satisfaction I was looking for when Seymour re-discovered what made him smile. I'll definitely watch this one again.",1262822400,,490,5.2025316455696204
3557885,4,B001EX9YOA,"Generally, I get a little freaked out by clowns, but I'm willing to make an exception for Ward Robert's ""Little Big Top."" Really good flick.

It's a small movie about a small town, but tells a warm and compelling story and is features some really strong performances.  Sid Haig comes through in a role that is perfect for him. And Richard Riehle - who is one of the most consistent actors working today. the dude is like clockwork. - lends credibility and emotional grounding. Some nifty performances and classic clowning from the supporting cast, too.

Tiny Peru, Indiana delivers a nice performance as well, and is as much a character as anyone. Helps the story feel textured and specific beyond what you may expect from a low budget indie.

A great story. Full of heart. Well worth checking out.",1262736000,,798,4.719424460431655
3557886,4,B001EX9YOA,"So many independent films, so little time...this one is worth watching again and again.  It's apparent it's on a small budget, but instead of that detracting from the film, it adds in the attention to detail and character development.  Watch it, it's worth the investment of time.",1262649600,,280,4.9361702127659575
3557887,4,B001EX9YOA,"I love this film for many reasons.  I would recommend it mostly for it's character development.  The characters are written well, cast well and acted well.  Sid Haig is not your steriotypical clown.  I went from really not liking him to
finding myself cheering for him as he tried to regain his clown status.  Jacob Zachar is adorable and irritating at the same time.  You can't help but remember someone just like him in your teen years.  Richared Rhiele's facial expressions just pulled
me right in as he wanted so badly to believe in Seymour.  Hollis Resnik may be my favorite of them all!!!  She was tough and soft-hearted at the same time.
The small town setting is the heart of the show.  There is an acceptance of the quirky personalities that you wouldn't find in a big city.  It's a setting many might long for especially in today's environment.
I do argue with the designation of ""comedy"".  There are many laughs but mostly laughs of encouragment and hope.
Try Little Big Top.  You'll like it.  It's unlike anything on else in films you might purchase.
While it's not rated I would not hesitate to watch it with young teens.  There is an important story to be learned.",1262563200,,1178,4.596153846153846

8299815,1,B001EX9YOA,"Love Sid Haig, but this movie went no where fast and then just ended.  Acting was not that great by most and terrible for some of the supporting actors.

Thank God for directors like Rob Zombie and Ward Roberts (director of ""Little Big Top"") who really utilize what Sid can do with good material. It took me a few watches to understand the film's genre. Whether it was a comedy with dramatic parts or vice versa. What it is though is a good film that the filmmakers made. You can respect indie-filmmaking after watching this.",1369699200,,422,4.423076923076923
8299819,4,B001EX9YOA,"I actually used to be one of those people who were afraid of clowns before seeing Sid in some of his other film appearances as a clown. He brings such a ingenuity to his clown style in an ironic way even in the worst of circumstances. It was his other appearances that made me check out this film.

This film was a great intimate look at not only everything that goes on behind the scenes of even a small amateur circus but also people as characters and having genuine human connections, let downs, feelings, and good/bad moments. I think this movie was really able to showcase Sid Haig's acting talent as well as some great other talent. I really have to say though that Sid was definitely highlighted and this film was able to show more dimensions to his talent.

The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because you don't get to see not only the clown act in the circus but also Seymour Smile's (Sid's character) routine is absent other than a great emotional face which he of course nailed perfectly. I really would have liked to see what they came up with. I guess they played it better safe than sorry to allow the audience to assume the show went well and Seymour's routine was a hit (which was hinted at with some audience applause at his facial expression anyway), but I really would have liked them to have blown the movie viewing audience with a great clown routine.",1360713600,,1387,4.435294117647059
