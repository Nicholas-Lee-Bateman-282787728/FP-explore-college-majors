8569117,5,B00BIQYL5U,"This is a classic film that every family should own.  The well known Sesame Street cast is present including all of the original muppets, Gordon, Olivia, Luis, Linda, etc.  Children will love the antics of Grover and Cookie Monster, the innocence of Big Bird, and the wonderful personalities that each of the characters bring to the film.  This film will have your kids loving Sesame Street for all of the same reasons you did when you were growing up and without all of the computer animated sketches on the program today.",1440028800,,523,4.725274725274725
