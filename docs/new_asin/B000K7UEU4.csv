2684901,4,B000K7UEU4,"This is a collection of cute little renderings of classic fairytales. Like all collections of fairytales, these stories all have morals, the only problem is, some of them are immoral, ie: Cleverness is better than honesty or kindness. But by and large, a nice production that teaches good morals.

Another excellent feature is the original Japanese dialog. So if you're looking for clean entertainment to get your kids started on Japanese, go for it!
