It begins at night, there is shooting at German troops. An officer orders the shooting of hostages. The Norsk Hydro plant collects heavy water (deuterium oxide); the Germans order increased production. A man brings an undeveloped photographic negative as a message to a man; his response is I must get to England. A boat leaves with people on it; they take over the ship in the name of the loyal Norwegians and the King of Norway (the government in exile). Will it be stopped? Can a mine be blown up with a pistol shot? Or pushed away with a long pole? Heavy water has qualities that make it useful for research in atomic physics. If the Germans are ahead in research their atomic bomb will win the war! The Norsk Hydro plant must be destroyed in a manner that will reduce civilian deaths. Two scientists are returned by parachute, then travel by skiing to friends.

That professor meets his ex-wife. They attend church on Sunday and sing Silent Night. A message is passed about future production. A stray rabbit sets off a land mine near the plant! A German officer inspects Rolfs identity card. A ground attack on the factory is totally impossible, so too a bombing attack by airplanes. How to minimize civilian hostages? What is so important about heavy water? There is a personal conflict over this; they will let London decide. A stranger happens to see them; what will they do with him? A British assault force is wiped out; what can be done next? Can a small group invade the factory and plant dynamite to destroy it? They put an explosive cord around the collectors. A German guard checks the locked doors! The explosions set off the alarms. There is shooting in the dark, but the intruders get away. Can they reach Sweden? The Germans inspect the damage. How long to resume full production? One year or one day?

Order are to get the attackers dead or alive. Hostages are taken for reprisals. Two men try to evade their pursuers. Rolf is meets the Germans and claims to be helping hunt the saboteurs, but is discovered and captured. But Rolf escaped from the bus! He is told about the restoration of production, London must be informed. The entire load of heavy water will be shipped by ferry to Germany, guarded by 1,000 troops. This is a new opportunity. Placing bombs on the ferry would sink in the deepest part of the lake where it could not be recovered. [Would they use an audible alarm clock instead of a silent chemical fuse?] The bombs explode, a waiting ship evacuated children and passengers. The ferry sinks below the waters.

This movie is slow-moving, the many dark scenes make it harder to follow. But that may have kept production costs down. Was it true to the facts or dramatized? Overall, yes. Sinking the ferry with all the heavy water minimized those who would be shot as hostages, and allow its future recovery. It is worth watching but is only an average movie.",1495670400,,2928,4.635838150289017
