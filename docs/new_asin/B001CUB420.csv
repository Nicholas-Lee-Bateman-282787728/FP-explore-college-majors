8289738,4,B001CUB420,"While doing family research, I discovered one of my ""great uncles"" served on the USS Meredith (DD-726). He was lost in action from the initial hit. This film was great in providing clues and details of his service and last days.

The mine vs glide-bomb controversy is the focus of this story. But, for me, the interviews, re-enactments & stock footage were most powerful and meaningful.

BTW, addition documentation, de-classified since the film was produced, has served to strengthen the ""glide-bomb"" argument. This includes German Luftwaffe records just coming to light that specifically name USS Meredith as hit by a HS293 radio-controlled glide bomb.

If you're interested in WWII History, or perhaps have a family member that served during the D-Day Invasion, or interested in the under-water detective work, then I expect you'll enjoy this film.",1294272000,,851,5.242647058823529
