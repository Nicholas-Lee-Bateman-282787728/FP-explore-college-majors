8602247,5,B000GYI23M,"A Year in the Life of an African Family offers visual documentation of village life in Burkina Faso. As a teacher of African Art History, I found the chapters on pottery, divination, and festival dance performance especially useful.  In addition, the sections on farming, family life, and food preparation offer good contextual information and demonstrate the close connection African villagers have to the earth. It is difficult to find good, current, films on African life and culture.  I'm very pleased to have this one. The running time is approximately 1 hour and 5 minutes.",1215561600,3,579,5.148936170212766
