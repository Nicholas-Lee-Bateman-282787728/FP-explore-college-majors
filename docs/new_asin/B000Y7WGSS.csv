3012314,5,B000Y7WGSS,I happen to get this from a friend who probably got it from here. I found out about this anime a while back about 3 years ago and was curious about what this would be like. When i watched the first episode i was like this is it? Thats what this is about? I was like what is this. But i was still drawn to it to find out that it got much deeper. More into action. More humor. More Mystery. I fell in love with a new anime. This anime is amazing. I do agree with Lakota Girl . Its very good give it a try and yea its like yu yu hakusho. It is worth the money trust me...,1215820800,4,568,3.7024793388429753
3012315,5,B000Y7WGSS,"I had heard a lot about this series and decided to give it a try by renting the first disc.  I was immediately hooked.  I love Yu Yu Hakusho for it's blend of action and humor and this series delivers on both counts as well.

The characters are diverse and interesting and the world they live in is much like Yu Yu Hakusho in that it is almost real and modern day, but not quite.

I'd recommend this series to any anime fan that enjoys good stories, a little mystery, fast paced action, and lots of humor.",1213401600,3,505,4.175257731958763

I enjoyed it. The artwork and story was good.",1413849600,,154,3.6666666666666665
8231079,5,B000Y7WGSS,"I would recommend this anime to anyone who is looking forward to action, friendship,  and adventure. As always, I tell everyone to use your own judgment.  But for me, I found it very enjoyable. So glad I bought this set on a whim. Well worth it! The only thing I did not like was the beginning song to every episode in season one.",1399939200,,330,4.222222222222222

8231081,4,B000Y7WGSS,"I'm writing this review late as I watched it quite a while ago. However, from what I remember I enjoyed this series quite a bit. I would not say that it is my favorite or that there aren't better anime out there because there are. However, I did not waste my time with this one. The characters are deep enough to care about, the action is solid and there is enough depth and mystery to the storyline to keep coming back to it.

If you like superpowers, action, comedy and some mystery in your anime I recommend giving this one a shot.",1320451200,,534,4.235294117647059
8231082,5,B000Y7WGSS,This anime strikes up to one of my top 10 favorites and man am I glad I bought this back when it was less than half the price it is now (was 38.98)....But if your looking for an anime with alot of action and a good amount of humor in it then the GetBackers is the anime for you no matter the price!,1290643200,,298,3.746031746031746
8231083,3,B000Y7WGSS,"I'm writing this review because I fell for all of the perfect reviews for this series and bought it. It is decent but has many more cons than pros.

Pros:
Good concept.
Cool characters.
Nice artwork.
Decent music.
Occasionally funny.

Cons:
The animation is apalling! Many action lines and instances of shaky stills. For example, this dude plays a flute, and music plays, but the camera will just pan up and down, no finger movements. Ban's snakebite attack usually just shows a shaking picture of his attack. This kind of stuff happens more often than not. Also, Ginji is in chibi form more than in normal form! I'm serious, he is a chibi(big head little body for comedic effect) almost all the time. I'm guessing that drawing a chibi is easier. Lazy bastards.

The story, while nice in a soap-operaish kind of way, is often too convenient. It makes perfect sense that Ban and Ginji are together all the time, however the other supporting characters just happen to appear in almost every episode. Imagine you went to the spa, and EVERY one of your friends happened to be there without anyone planning it. That kind of crap happens non-stop and it makes the story very repetitive, in my opinion. Also, it forgets that it SHOULD be about getting things back, but becomes more about fighting and filler.

This series is too long for what little story it tells.

The action is decent, but rediculous. Look, I'm not saying a show has to be bloody to be good, but when someone gets cut, at least show a scratch! There is not one drop of blood despite all of the fights. Did they replace that with scuffs and bruises? Nope. What do we get? TORN CLOTHES! Their clothes rip and they hold the tear like it hurts. Is this edited by 4kids or did that actually happen?

There are many things that wink towards yaoi fangirls, and that kind of crap makes me sick.

All in all, it is a decent show. I just don't get the hype. If you can get this for a steal, it is worth it.",1285113600,,1959,4.455307262569832
8231084,5,B000Y7WGSS,"I love Anime! What I find most thrilling is that the Japanese take their animation seriously but they know how to balance with slapstick comedy and deep emotion. The GetBackers was a total surprise and quickly became one of my favorites. You will become a true fan of Ban & Ginji and start saying, ""Who needs Heroes?"" & ""X-Men who?"" Come watch these guys get it back.",1263427200,,367,4.492537313432836
8231085,5,B000Y7WGSS,"I'm new to Anime so probably not the person to really be commenting on this. That being said, I bought this for my son as a birthday present and consider myself lucky. This is not a show for little ones as there is plenty of violence and some low key sexual issues. I guess the best comment I can offer is that every time my son watches some of these I have to sit down and watch. They are riveting. Very sad that only 2 seasons were made.",1247443200,6,439,4.0
8231086,5,B000Y7WGSS,"Getbackers is a fun 26 episode romp centering around Ban Midou and Ginji Amano, the Getbackers; a recovery service with a 100% success rate.  It's true, they're good at what they do, but when it comes to money... let's just say the first time we are introduced to them, they are sleeping in their car with a bar tab up the wazoo.  The money gods do not smile on them often, and many of their jobs do not pay much at all.

Though the show has a feel of a ""boss of the week"" series, the show delves into the lives of the two recovery agents and those of their past and present.  Ban Midou has a special ability called the Jagan or ""evil eye"" that gives an illusion to whoever looks him in the eye for one minute.  Ginji Amano has the ability to generate electricty in his body.  You will see this often.  The other characters in the show have their share of abilites as well.  Shido is a beastmaster and has the ability to communicate with animals.  Kazuki Fuuchoin can manipulate koto (harp) strings as weapons or as spying threads.  Then there is Akabane (Dr. Jackal) who stores deadly scapels in his body and has a special liking for Ginji, much to his dismay.

It's action packed, hilarious, and even a pinch of serious as the Limitless Fortress, the link to most of the characters' pasts, comes up repeatedly near the end of each season.  It's a great series and not to be missed.  Not for those who want something deep and meaningful, but if you want hilarity and a little bit of butt-kicking, this is the show for you.",1228780800,8,1523,4.339222614840989
8231087,5,B000Y7WGSS,"Ok I'm going to write an official review aside from the two that obviously did not go into detail about what the show is about.  Getbackers is a humorous and yet very serious anime about two retrieval agents named Midou Ban and Amano Ginji (The Getbackers).  The story starts out with a girl that loses a keepsake from her mother that has passed away.  Incomes Midou and Genji....their job is simple, supply them with enough money and they will get back any item that is stolen (in fact they claim to have a  100% retrieval rate).  They are never good with money as it seems they are always broke and rely Paul (he is the store owner in the series) to keep a tab for them so they can eat.  It seems as if nothing ever comes easy for them after the 2nd episode of the series.  The series is 49 episodes complete so I will not go into every detail of the series.

Now on to the 2 main characters of the show:

Midou Ban--Well let's just say that he loves his shades.....he has a special ability of the ""Evil Eye"" in which he induces a minute long dream/nightmare, but he can only use it 3x in one day or use it only once a singe person in a 24 hour period.  He has another main attack in which he uses all the way through the series....it is called the ""Snakebite"".  His grip in which he uses through the ""Snakebite"" has 200kg of pressure.  All in all he extremely strong and his ability for strength is undeniably superior to anyone else's strength and abilities.

Amano Ginji--He is the Lightning Emperor of ""Limitless Fortress"" a.k.a ""Infinite Castle"" and leader of ""The VOLTS"".  His special ability is to channel electricity through out his body.  These abilities heighten and cause much more substancial damage if there is a major power source near by.  The only person to have supposedly beat him is Midou Ban in the Limitless Fortress.  Throught the series he is not who he used to be; in that when he left Limitless Fortress he was no longer the Lightning Emperor.  He wanted to do good and help people rather than instill fear into them by being the Lightning Emperor.  He has a very good heart and it shows throughout the series.

Ok enough about the characters....you will just have to watch the show to see all of them and what their specific jobs are in it.  Now my first initial thought of the show was,""This is ok, but nothing jumps out about it""....the story will not immediately hook with the first couple of episodes considering it sets up the characters for it.  Midou and Ginji's first dangerous assignment comes in the 3rd episode of the series and this is where the anime really starts to engross you into the series.  From this point on in the series you will see two of the other six main characters of the series (Transporters)....Akabane (Dr. Jackal) the master of knives and Himiko (Lady Poison) who uses poison perfumes as her attacks.  I would have to say that Akabane is, by far, the most intriguing person in the whole series.  He is calm, cool, and full of himself.  The more dangerous the job, the more he wants to do the job, and the more entertained he becomes.  Eventhough, he is an evil person in the show he was my favorite person from the show.  Himiko is Midou's former partner, and that story unfolds as the series progresses.

The series is all about how Limitless Fortress controls everything that goes on in life.  Everybody that is from Limitless Fortress believes that they are just pawns to much higher being.  ""Brain Trust"" is the main source for what happens there.  There are virtual and actual humans that make up Limitless Fortress from Brain Trust.  The whole premise of what transsends through the series is from a character called MakubeX.  He learns the truth about how Brain Trust controls everything and plans to kill everything off with an atomic bomb, because of this horrible truth he knows.  This is the part of the series that really gets you into the series.  After that I just couldn't stop watching.  I had to find out what was going to happen.  There are a few more episodes that are fillers in between, but I would have to say that this was a really enjoyable anime that had really funny moments, but had some very deep story lines, also.

I highly recommend this great anime to anyone that is worried about what is out there.  5stars all the way.  You will not be disappointed.",1226275200,,4344,4.489795918367347
