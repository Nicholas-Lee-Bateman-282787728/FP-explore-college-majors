6854204,5,B00Q56TN8I,These bears are true to life and funny as they want to be.  I have enjoyed all three seasons so much as these three bears and Toddy the Hottie of the group solve crime and get to see some hot sexy guys along the way.

6854224,5,B00Q56TN8I,"I don't know if it was due to a slightly bigger budget or whether the writers are getting more confident, but this was the best written, best acted and funniest season so far of this show. The final episode is a classic, with a seamless mix of raunchy gay humor and old fashioned slap stick comedy.
Im definitely excited about a season 4 ahead.",1433116800,,344,4.390625

6854231,5,B00Q56TN8I,If you want something that is both entertaining and addictive at the same time this will be the movie(s) to watch. I have watched all 3 seasons including the special editions. The cast is extremely funny but at the same they can be very sentimental. This would be great for TV!!,1428105600,,278,4.470588235294118

6854236,5,B00Q56TN8I,"True to the format, Season #3 has all the same characters, each one delightful to follow. But about 2/3rds of the way into this one, I felt it was getting a tad tiresome as more and more murder suspects get suggested. But THEN they added the most over the top finale segment ever of a plane full of Bears flying to Australia. This was the most hilarious episode of all! Buy some of the  diapers they show in Nelson's ads  as you will wet your pants laughing! ha ha! I also have really enjoyed the special holiday episodes they give you as an added feature on each season's dvd. Can we look forward now  to a Valentine's special  where Todd proposes? PLEASE? It's all growl-iscious!",1426464000,,681,4.424
