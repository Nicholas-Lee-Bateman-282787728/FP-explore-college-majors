8404071,3,B003S6T5TU,"At the bottom of the DVD cover, in admitedly smallish print is the proud statement ""Digitally Remastered Sound enhanced"" - Could someone give a definitive explanation of ""Digitally Remastered""? Please!! Every fan of Corman knows all these films have been issued many times - solo and in box set collections. I have 4 of them myself, but this was cheap and it said ""DR"" so I thought here is my opportunity to get good prints...NO - OK they are quite watchable, but NOT Mint. ""SWAMP WOMEN/SHE GODS/THE TERROR/DEMENTIA 13"" are no better than my Alpha DVDs and videos from other sources (I am one of the few people who don't enjoy ""Little Shop.."" and I haven't seen it in this collection). So, just be warned-If you haven't got them already then this collection could be for you. If you have I really wouldn't bother. Sad but true cos the films are fun. (Will we ever get OKLAHOMA WOMAN???)",1359849600,5,886,4.613924050632911
8404072,3,B003S6T5TU,"These aren't bad, but I bought it mostly for 'Dementia 13' and 'Little Shop of Horrors'. I had hoped for transfers from better prints than what has been available in the past. I got a Legend Films DVD of 'Little Shop of Horrors', which has a MUCH better copy.",1295568000,4,259,4.3061224489795915
