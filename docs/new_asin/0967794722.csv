8544172,4,0967794722,"This little documentary is really much more than a documentary about lobstering. It's that too of course; the nuts and bolts of the process are all here.  The underwater footage of the lobsters both in and out of the traps, the authentic narration by Dana Eldridge, and the intimate interviews with the lobstermen themselves make this a great snapshot of a disappearing way of life on Cape Cod.

Though it's part of a series, the one video stood on its own very well and my 8th grade class sat still throughout.  I held back from 5 stars only because this is not yet available on DVD.  Nevertheless, I look forward to its release, and hopefully more bonus footage!

Not much on Cape Cod here at Amazon- where is it all?",1118620800,5,719,4.5
8544173,5,0967794722,"Watching this made me realize lobsters are more than just great food, though I did get a bit hungry seeing the big ones come up in the traps.
A slick, sensual, yet visceral National Geographic-type documentary.  I didn't expect much but this was very well-done: I imagine this would be great in schools.  I'm ordering the next one in the series too, though I have no idea what a ""dogfish"" is...",1036713600,9,394,4.535211267605634
8544174,4,0967794722,"The underwater footage here of the lobsters, both in their habitat and being caught, really makes this film.  Never in my life would I believe a lobster catching a live fish as it swims by without seeing it here with my own eyes.
A great independent gem...",1033948800,9,256,4.446808510638298
8544175,5,0967794722,I have the whole series and won't clog up the recommendation section with another one.  But I have all four- and can't wait for #5!  Just as good as anything on PBS these days...,1022284800,10,178,4.205882352941177
8544176,5,0967794722,"I loved their video ""Wrecks"" as well and, being a lover of Cape Cod and all things salty I love this video just as much.
Lots of underwater video of the lobsters- even a shot of one getting a live fish in its claws.  (And I thought they just  ate garbage as it floated by.
Good nuts and bolts about lobsters and how they're caught, steers away from the politics and everchanging regulations.
If you liked Mark Kurlansky's ""Cod"" or ""The Perfect Storm"" you'll like this too I think!",982627200,17,480,4.382022471910112
