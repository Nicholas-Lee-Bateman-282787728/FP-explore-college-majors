This is about a womanizer who falls in love with a ""good girl.""  I usually don't care for that tired plot line because it's a sexist tool that divides women into madonnas vs. whores.  Also, there are serious ethical issues violated here.  In the US, many of these characters could go to court and sue the pants off of other characters.
Having said all that: if suicide, AIDS, racist depictions of Asians, fea-kal matter and other things could ever be funny, this film does try to achieve it.  The film has a sweet ending to it.
I saw this through a certain red envelope business.  Oftentimes, that service doesn't do a good job of telling the viewer where a film is made.  I knew this was a Spanish-language film, but not from which country.  However, once I saw mariachi musicians, HUGE sombreros, and even a Mexican masked wrestler, I realized this is a Mexican film.  Still, like many Latin American movies, all the characters were white even though Mexico is filled with light brown people.  So this film can be condemned for its Eurocentricity and lack of color diversity.
Still, I enjoyed this film.  I think it was serendipitous that I found it.  I think other viewers will be pleased by it too.",1278720000,,1386,4.562753036437247
