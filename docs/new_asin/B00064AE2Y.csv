8038187,5,B00064AE2Y,One of the best stories to come alone in anime in some time.  Not a put on in the background kind of series. Along with the main character the audience as to try and make sense of the world they are thrown into.  Epic war fantasy.,1394668800,,230,3.9782608695652173
8038188,5,B00064AE2Y,"I was truly blown away by this. My girlfriend came in around episode 13 during a recap and was like OMG how can you remember all those weird terms.
I admit normally this would be frustrating and a problem, however when you start to get it it is so rewarding. This show is so good it creates a desire to have a deeper understanding of the world and does not feel like a chore at all. And trust me, I hate learning new things.
When you can explain the difference between Keiki and Renrin, and why they are names what they are, you are winning!",1357862400,,541,4.161904761904762
8038189,5,B00064AE2Y,"Well, the jig is up for Youko. Surrounded by the Royal Army, which ironically should be under her command, she must take on the morally challenged lord Shoukou by herself. Her own courtiers have turned against her and all she has behind her is a ragtag army. And the other two young ladies, Shoukei and Suzu, might also have a part to play in the oncoming battle. If Youko loses, she'll most likely lose her queenship and her head!

This is a good conclusion to the story of Youko and the other two girls. The thing I like about this series is that it shows that people can change. Too many times in our world, people stop growing in their hearts and become fossilized remains of their former dreams or goals. Youko never stops trying to live up to her destiny, and has progressed from a whiny highschooler to a great leader. Suzu has come a long way since her 100 year servitude when she learned that other people suffer besides her. Shoukei has finally let go of her pride. It's a great message. This is an excellent series.",1120521600,3,1026,4.428571428571429
8038190,5,B00064AE2Y,"If you are looking for an anime with a lot of depth, character development, and storyline, this is the anime series for you.

I really hope they make more and elaborate on the story hinted in episode 40.

Whether that happens or not, this is one of my favorites now. It is an excellent anime that I couldn't stop watching.",1106352000,,322,4.35
8038191,5,B00064AE2Y,"I have been following this series for over a year since the first DVD came out. What a ride it was, this series is a well told story. The final few episodes of the arch concering the three girls, Suzu, Youko and Shoukei, wrap up this story better than one can imagine. There are a few dull moments when the girls talk about the same point over and over but it is all good. One con of this DVD is the kind of poor quailty of the animation on the last few episodes. Overall it is on par with the other 8 DVD's of the series.

The first 4 episodes of the DVD are the wrap up of the final battles between the rebels and the armies of the Wa Provence. The 5th episode is a stand alone story that almost seems like an epilouge. It also helps set up the next small story arch that deals with the Kingdom of En. It is unclear is Media Blasters INC plan on releasing this final story or not. I hope they do they had a preview for it at the end of episode 40, the last one of the disk.

Anyways this series is one of the best I have seen in a long time. I have enjoyed collecting and watching. I recomend it to anyone looking for something different.",1104364800,9,1140,3.9737991266375547
