7898007,5,6305799482,"This film was a real surprise. Touted on the cover as ""In the tradition of My Life as a Dog"" - I was on my guard from the beginning. But it's great - well written, well directed (Marius Holst's directorial debut) and with a terrific cast - it's funny, it's eerie, it's tragic by turns. The screenplay is adapted from Lars Saabye Christensen's novel ""The boy who just wanted to be one of the guys"" by the author.  But it was the performances of all the actors that struck me most - Martin Dahl Garfalk plays 12 year old Otto and Trond Halbo is his loopy friend Johnny.  You will be mesmerised by the charismatic Jan Devo Kornstad - this is his only movie - and Dahl Garfalk has only acted in a few TV series and a James Bond type short in the 17 years since this film was released in Norway, despite his obvious gift.
This is an engaging film - full of infectious performances.  It runs for 96 minutes - with no special features (of course) but truth to tell, it doesn't need any.  See it for yourself - it is available commercially, but you'll have to track it down.",1290297600,,1066,4.236453201970443
7898008,5,6305799482,This is a remarkable film with amazing acting and a compelling story line. The scene with the piano tuner is hysterically funny. There is a very nice balance between the darkness and joys of life. The ending of the film shows the need for personal freedom that we all seek.,1207872000,,273,4.48
7898009,5,6305799482,"I thought this movie was very well done all-around.  The lead actor, 12 year old Martin Dahl Garfalk, plays the vulnerable Otto who has to deal with loneliness, family ordeals, and his first kiss.  Otto befriends a male stranger, Jan Devo Kornstad who does give off a creepy vibe.  You eventually learn his true intent. This movie is very much worth buying.  There's nothing objectionable.",1201392000,5,389,4.938461538461539
