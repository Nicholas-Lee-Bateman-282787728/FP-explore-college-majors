This is a GREAT movie!

This DVD is a LOUSY copy, with a difficult to hear vocal soundtrack, mostly drowned out by the music and FX.

After I advised them of my disappointment, the nice people at Amazon sent me a replacement copy, but that was just as bad as the first one.

I have copies of this movie going back over 25 years on various video (tape) formats, so I know what the David Williamson dialogue should sound like.

A wonderful piece of late 1960's Australiana, which unfortunately is spoilt.

For my money, try and get yourself one of the VHS versions, as this one is not worth the plastic it is burned into.",1167868800,2,622,4.318965517241379
842870,4,6304326270,"Don (Jon Hargreaves) and his wife host a party with friends to watch election returns (in Australia), only this party is more like a fierce battle in a hellish war than a pleasant time spent with friends. Everyone is on the make and most of the party-goers are boorish and nasty. It's reminiscent of WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF in this regard, though it's greatly magnified in the nastiness department. The acting is excellent with good character analyses, but these people are so cruel to each other that watching them becomes almost unbearable. Why would anyone stay at such a party?",1146268800,2,588,4.8316831683168315
842871,5,6304326270,"""Don's Party"" is an advertisement for bad behavior in which every single character is angry, arrogant, hypocritical, selfish, or stupid. Not one of these libidinous lunatics displays anything remotely resembling good sense or good judgment, nor do any escape unscathed. Scathing, too, is the director's venom toward an aggressive, misogynistic culture, captured in microcosm by an out-of-control election-night gathering set in Sydney on the verge of the self-absorbed, sex-addled, and status-obsessed 1970s. The talented actors commit completely to their director's grim vision, adapted from a play whose harsh, crude dialogue makes that of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" seem tame by comparison.

Australians are well-known for their abusive sense of humor, but were they really ever this horrible? Are they still? Don't spoil the movie by asking too many questions. Let go of any desire to sympathize with these cruel, foul-mouthed people and instead revel in their drunken cupidity, vicious mayhem, and profound misery. Watch them lose control as their untrammeled contempt and cynicism precipitate shouting matches and fistfights, forcing marriages and friendships to disintegrate. Profanity and nudity abound. Enjoy your ringside seat at a bloody boxing match we call society, witnessing mankind's animalistic nature without civilization's thin veneer.

This film hit me like a bolt of lightning, and it should have a similar effect on you. Simultaneously a riotous jape and an appalling tragedy, it's a shock you won't soon forget. The characters lash out relentlessly, pushing each other's buttons without mercy, needling and degrading one another until someone snaps, much to the amusement of the entire company. Hopelessly shallow and petty, they smirk and sneer obnoxiously, then rut and brawl like adolescents. At the end of the film, as they face the emptiness of their failed lives and the consequences of their dreadful conduct, you may find yourself both laughing and crying for these foolish mortals -- and for yourself.",1138060800,6,2040,5.535256410256411
842872,4,6304326270,"I saw Don's Party in theatrical release, then on VHS, then on DVD.  The film is basically talk, so the poor sound mix on the DVD is frustrating indeed.  Fortunately I kept my VHS, and will probably stick to watching that; I watchthe film about every five years.",1134000000,12,261,4.416666666666667
842873,3,6304326270,"I have to admit that I didn't like any of the characters in this movie, but I kept watching, anyway. Anti-heroic, Me-generation characters really mix it up with sex, booze and explitive-filled rants about the rich and the working class. To me, the context of this film was much more interesting than any of its other elements. The surprise sensation of watching this movie is kind of like stumbling across an old photo of one of your conservative uncles, who is now shown holding a biker chic in one arm and giving the finger to 'The Man' with the other.",1087171200,2,554,4.55
842874,4,6304326270,"Obscure but worthwhile little nugget from ""Breaker Morant"" director Bruce Beresford that folds in one part ""Shampoo"", one part ""Return Of The Secausus 7"" and sprinkles liberally with ""Who's Afraid Of Virgina Woolf"". The story takes place in Australia on election eve, 1969. Don and his uptight wife are hosting an ""election party"" for old college chums at thier solidly middle-class suburban home. With the exception of one self-absorbed Casanova, most of the guests range from recently divorced to unhappily married. Ostensibly gathering to watch election results, talk politics and socialize, Don's party quickly deteriorates into a veritable primer on bad human behavior as the alcohol kicks in. By the end of the night, marriages are on the rocks, friendships nearly broken and people are taking naked swims in the vacationing neighbor's pool. Yet, this is not just another wacky party story. It has a lot to say about mid-life crisis, elitism, politics, and the silly behavior between men and women in general. Savagely funny and well-acted, this is a sleeper worth seeking out. DVD notes: I would agree that the audio mix is uneven at times (the Aussie accents and slang are tough going anyway) but the picture isn't half bad if you tweak it a bit. I did an ""A/B"" with my 20 year old home-taped VHS copy, and it appears that the original print was a dodgy propostition to begin with, so short of a restored Criterion edition (don't hold your breath), ""it is what it is"".",1083283200,6,1476,4.908
842875,1,6304326270,"This is a 5 star movie with 1 star disc quality.  The audio is so poor that I would not recommend its purchase to others.  I can't even share this movie with friends, as they won't be able to understand the dialogue - it's only because I know most of the dialogue already that I can stand watching it.",1059868800,7,301,4.084745762711864
842876,5,6304326270,"Sydney, Australia, late 1960s. A national election is being held in which the Labor party may be returned to power after 20 years of numbing right-wing rule under the so-called Liberal party. A bunch of old university friends gather excitedly at Don's place to have a party and watch the election results on the television. They're all thirty-somethings now, most of them with families, but they remember their activist, free-spirited socialist youth. That's actually pretty much how they still see themselves at the start of the party. But as the alcohol flows and the night wears on, they grudgingly admit, if only within, that they've joined the dreaded moneyed class and could hardly care less who wins the election. By turns thought-provoking and side-splittingly funny, ""Don's Party"" resonates disturbingly with all of us who've seen our early passions replaced by a mundane though comfortable reality, accompanied by vague feelings of self-betrayal. Bruce Beresford ably directs this superb play by David Williamson. Strongly recommended. It's that rare thing - a movie for adults.",951868800,4,1088,5.3313953488372094
