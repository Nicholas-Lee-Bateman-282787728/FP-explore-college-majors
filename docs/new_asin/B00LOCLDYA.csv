6497499,5,B00LOCLDYA,"My husband loved this gift.  The ""documentary"" aspect was well done.",1420848000,3,68,5.181818181818182
6497500,5,B00LOCLDYA,"This is a very convincing mockumentary about evidence of the existence of mermaids. Using real footage and interviews with ""scientists"", the filmmakers lay out how mer-people could possibly exist, including a nifty theory that they evolved from early hominids that enjoyed swimming and had a fish-based diet. The production is high-quality and the science is sound (if imaginative).",1418947200,4,382,5.603448275862069
6497501,5,B00LOCLDYA,This documentary is very well made. It  keeps you interested Since the beginning to the end. My grandpa...RIP used to tell us a story of the time  he saw a creature half human half fish when he was a soldier. He would of loved this documentary. I once read that the Greek mythology was no myth..that actual experiments were done creating 1/2 human 1/2 animal....1/2 human 1/2 FISH.  If you believe then this is a movie for you. Even if you don't it will entertain you.,1449878400,4,468,4.4186046511627906
6497502,5,B00LOCLDYA,I loved it and I still believe its true,1444867200,,39,3.4444444444444446
6497503,5,B00LOCLDYA,"wow, more  people should know this story, to learn of something right here on this  planet is so profound. it is a shame that our government wants to control everything. they say they protect us, but is it us or them they are worried about, and what in the hell would this hurt the whole world to know,,. It was great. I give it 5 stars.",1443398400,,337,4.090909090909091
6497504,3,B00LOCLDYA," but the one of these I saw wasn't bad if you keep in mind that it's fiction. I think it was New Evidence"" that I saw on TV, anyway- the recreations of ""sightings"" looked good, came out much better than the interviews with the ""scientists"".
It's worth a look.",1436745600,,259,4.285714285714286
6497505,5,B00LOCLDYA,"This is all the info that was shown on animal planet in 2013. The 3 hour documentary about the mermaids. But you can't find any of this footage online anymore. (People tell me the government took it off) so I've been searching, and this is it guys. And if you don't believe, think the world is a perfect place, watch this. Because something everyone should know is the government lies and hides stuff from us all the time! Great product:)",1431820800,5,438,4.4875
6497506,5,B00LOCLDYA,Great documentary. Will never be tired of watching it.,1430870400,,54,5.111111111111111
6497507,5,B00LOCLDYA,"I just want people to know that I couldn't tell from the ad that this DVD had both episodes of Season 1 but it definitely does.
It contains Episode 1) Mermaids: The Body Found, 1 hr 25 min

and Episode 2) Mermaids: The New Evidence, 42 min, which was aired quite a while after the first episode.

Coming from a science and engineering background as well as having a doctorate in medicine, I would tell people that the first episode is quite interesting and compelling even though it is supposedly only a ""mockumentary"". It seems like they did it that way, used actors to act out a documentary, because the actual scientists didn't want to be filmed and they didn't feel they had enough hard evidence to call it a documentary. However, if you watch that and then watch the 2nd episode, I believe it is more than just interesting. It does seem to give evidence that there are human related creatures of potentially human level intelligence in our oceans today. It does seem to give evidence that humanity should strongly question and probably prohibit the sonar experiments and sonar tests we do for military purposes, as well as underwater oil drilling related activities. I believe everyone should watch this video, especially scientists and citizens that have any interest in protecting the oceans. I believe it is NOT pseudo-science and it deserves a look.

Here's a quote from world famous scientist and oceanographer Dr. Sylvia Earle who has won a long list of awards and who has won records for deepest ocean depths explored and so forth. ""The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea....The ocean is large and resilient, but it is not too big to fail. What we are taking out of the sea, what we are putting into the sea are actions that are undermining the most important thing the ocean delivers to humankind  our very existence.""

8667408,5,B00LOCLDYA,"I love this and a very similar picture, dragons a fantasy made real, it's a great what if scenario. But there is enough Scientific inaccuracies to make it  fictitious enough to call it fiction.",1490572800,,193,4.676470588235294

8667410,5,B00LOCLDYA,"Very interesting. Read somewhere that this is a ""mockmentary"" or something like that. A fabrication presented as ""documentary"". But still have a feeling that it tells the truth about a possible cover-up from the government and the secret projects of the military that has no conscience or consideration to us, commoners.",1483142400,,320,5.294117647058823
