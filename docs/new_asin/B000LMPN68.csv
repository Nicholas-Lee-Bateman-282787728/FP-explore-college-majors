Really tight script and great story, great cast of actors, very catchy songs specially Rajesh 's drunk qawali and Mumtaz's dances. Rajesh and Mumtaz have such a great onscreen chemistry, it is amazing! Love the songs, love Rajesh with his truck-driver brawny self in the first half. He is good in comedy scenes too, specially the scene in the barber's shop when Rajesh is telling his ghost experience, is simply hilarious. Overall a great watch, gets a little lengthy at the end but enjoyable. I loved it and will recommend it.",1371427200,,594,4.613207547169812
