2493926,5,B000E5KQQ4,"..this is just a feature-length version of the acclaimed BBC series ""The Blue Planet"", available from amazon.com as ""The Blue Planet - Seas of Life Collector's Set"" (ASIN: B000069HXC). The set costs only $12 more than ""Deep Blue"" and is highly recommended. That said I still bought ""Deep Blue"" on Region 2 DVD which is a 2 DVD set with a Dolby Digital 5.1 Music Only track. This is available from amazon.co.uk (ASIN: B0002W12WQ) at only ?8.97 ($15.70). A bargain if you can play Region 2 PAL DVDs.

Also if you are keen to see more of those cute penguins, which are emphasized for obvious reasons, be advised that there are only about three minutes of penguin footage in ""Deep Blue"".",1144195200,11,683,4.644628099173554
2493927,4,B000E5KQQ4,"This is a beautifully filmed documentary about life in the oceans.  It covers a wide variety of species in breathtaking vignettes about their lives and, sometimes, their deaths.

A lot of what goes on in the oceans is based on finding food to survive, so it's not surprising that many of the segments include footage of various animals and fish hunting and feeding on their prey.  It's not too disturbing when the prey are small schooling fish, but some of the sequences with larger mammals made me wonder why the film has a G rating.  Small children are almost certain to be confused and upset.

Nonetheless, the film is wonderful for slightly older audiences.  It's a beautifully filmed, honest, and fascinating look at the myriad life forms that inhabit our oceans.",1142553600,35,768,4.824427480916031
2493928,2,B000E5KQQ4,"Just came from the cinema. The film was repeated today, 15 Feb 06, in a program cinema (which was sold out!). The movie contains fantastic pictures of many of the well-known and not so well-known big creatures of the sea: all kinds of whales, sharks, turtles, mantas, seals, penguins. But also small beings like small fish in huge swarms, shrimps, jelly fish, and the strange light-emitting cratures of the deep sea are shown. There is no real plot (like there is none in real life) but the images have superior quality and one asks oneself again and again how they were shot.

I would have given Deep Blue a rating of 4 if there hadn't been one sequence of scenes which I perceived as visual rape of the audience, especially of those members of the audience who love their children: In maximum detail, the film shows how a group of killer whales hunt down a grey whale baby and partially eat it. Nobody would ever think of showing to a general audience how a human child is hunted down and killed, e.g. by wolves, without at least warning that there will be ""explicit content"". Whales are large mammals and one identifies the whale baby automatically with a human child. It's just very painful to watch it being killed. Of course, nature is full of death, and the authors already made this point when they showed at the beginning of the film how killer whales hunt sea lions. But the only explanation I can think of why they showed the killing of the whale baby in such detail is that they are trying to satisfy the assumed craving of the audience for sensation. However, by assuming that their audience has such a craving, the authors unmask themselves as sensationalists. And looking back at the whole film, this judgement holds. After all it's just a B-movie.",1139961600,11,1763,4.614649681528663

May be great for people that are already aware of what is being filmed, but if you hope to learn anything - forget it!  We were very disappointed - could have been a great educational nature film but failed royally!",1266710400,2,388,4.436619718309859
2494012,3,B000E5KQQ4,This video is out takes from the Blue Planet series. While it is visually great there is little information to go along with the video clips. Good if you just want something pretty to look at and are not looking for any sort of information.,1246406400,,240,4.355555555555555
2494013,5,B000E5KQQ4,"This is a basically a nature film on steroids.  The cinematography is awesome. Penguins appear to fly under water.  Whales emerging out of seemingly bottomless seas. Large schools of fish appear as synchronized single units. Strange creatures who live in depths where daylight never penetrates.

This movie is just amazing.  It gave me a whole new love for this beautiful planet we live on. I think people of all ages would have the same reaction; and to think we use the oceans as a waste dump.

This movie may be needed for the future of this planet. All children could keep an appreciation for their home and perhaps perceive the earth as a single living organism.  It should be mandatory viewing for all members of US Congress along with their families.  It should be seen by ALL world leaders and politicians.",1244678400,,814,4.7304964539007095
2494014,5,B000E5KQQ4,"This is a beautifully photographed,absolutely great presentation of the Earth's oceans and the life that exists in and around the oceans.

There is included a short presentation of how the film was made. Be sure not to miss seeing what the film makers went through to get their footage.

Do not get me wrong, it is pretty. Just not quite a best of Blue Planet. But for 10$ more you can get the entire 5 disk Blue Planet set, right now from amazon.  Before buying this check out Blue Planet. I'm sure you'll want to compare both to compare price vs content.",1221350400,4,500,4.297872340425532

2494073,5,B000E5KQQ4,This is a movie that will allow you to see the world's oceans.  What makes it so different is the spectacular camera work.  It effortlessly catches penguins swimming underwater and then follows them seamlessly as they shoot out of the water and land on a glacier. You will float under an ice shelf barely clearing it...go deep into the darkest part of the ocean to see illuminated sea creatures that most have never seen before. It is a beautifully filmed spectacular work that will excite your senses as well as educate you.  Not to be missed.,1192579200,2,544,4.645833333333333
2494074,4,B000E5KQQ4,"This is not a hard core documentary that satisfies a hunger for learning. Instead, it is an appetizer to whet the appetite. It is survey of the polar environments and the lifeforms that inhabit them. The video is stunning and the narration is adequate. For young people, it will be quite a treat. For those hungering for more information, they will not find it here. That does not stop the enjoyment, however. It is well done.",1180310400,3,426,4.618421052631579

""We have walked on the moon and continue to push the open boundaries of space.  Yet it is the mysteries of the ocean that continue to elude us""

The above is what the narrator (Pierce Brosnan) says at the end of this mesmerizing ""cinematic masterpiece"" that comes from the creators of the landmark BBC series ""The Blue Planet.""  This movie is an exploration (mostly underwater) into the secret lives of sea creatures.

Generally, this film begins at the ocean beach and moves to the open ocean.  From there, we are taken to the Earth's poles to see ""the frozen ocean"" and then finally to the dark ocean depths to view an ""alien world"" where life (that's never been captured on film) has adapted.

This film is a visual feast.  There is minimal narration.  I appreciated the scarce narration since I found that the visually stunning images speak for themselves.  The stirring background music adds to the viewer's visual experience.

I recommend also viewing ""The Making of Deep Blue"" fifty-minute DVD extra.  You will hear about all the technical challenges and risks that were taken involved with this documentary.  (In fact, I appreciated the film even more after viewing this extra.)  Besides technical information, I found that there was additional interesting information not included by the narrator of the main feature.

Finally, there were two problems I had with this movie.  First, it is rated ""G.""  Because this film shows some images that may be disturbing to the very young, I feel it should have been thus rated ""PG.""  Second, the DVD case shows a picture of only penguins.  However, the film features many other marine creatures from whales and dolphins to crabs and jellyfish.

In conclusion, viewing this film is a unique experience--""a remarkable, jaw-dropping experience!!""

2494076,5,B000E5KQQ4,"As a nature film lover I give this film 5 stars! From the soundtrack to the deeply beautiful cinematography everything about ""Deep Blue"" is amazing. Stunning images of natural beauty are presented as a feast for the eyes. The many facets of life that live in and around the oceans of the world are the main characters of this film. Many animal species are depicted- from penguins to wales to polar bears. Many creatures of the deep sea have never been captured on film before!

Thanks to the efforts of the creators of ""Deep Blue"" these invisible wonders can now be enjoyed in your own living room! One of our favorite movies!

As a movie fan I have to give this film 2 thumbs up, way up!",1177372800,4,688,4.409448818897638
2494077,5,B000E5KQQ4,We purchased this movie because we saw it on National Geographic television. The movie is amazing and the photographers have done shots that we have never seen before. The movie makes you feel good and leaves you wanting more to watch. They are so clever with the cameras and have gone above and below the surface of the water to bring us the best nature movie we have seen in a long time. We would reccommend this for a friends and family movie night and you will be amazed.,1173916800,,475,4.348314606741573

2494079,5,B000E5KQQ4,"This documentary about the oceans and the life found there is a very beautiful way to see life that's not found on land. The cinematography is first-rate and quite breath-taking. I particularly found the life in the very deep recesses of the Mariana trenches to be particularly fascinating. They appear to be extraterrestrial! The narrative I found wanting---but adequate. All in all, a beautiful work that I would think anyone would enjoy immensely.",1173830400,3,450,5.178082191780822
2494080,5,B000E5KQQ4,"One of the best oceanic viewing experiences I've seen in years!  The breathtaking cinematography, gorgeous in every detail, is enhanced by a wonderful musical score.  The DVD extras include a ""making of"" documentary which is fascinating in its own right.  The BBC hit this one out of the park!  It is great for the whole family...there are only 2 or 3 scenes that younger children may find scarey or upsetting (Killer whales & sharks hunting and eating), but most of this amazing program is simply beautiful.  It makes me wish that I could watch it on IMAX!!",1168387200,5,558,4.711340206185567
2494081,5,B000E5KQQ4,"The BBC documentary The Blue Planet first aired in 2001, and this film is dramatised from the footage of that ground breaking series.

So unlike the reviewer who mentions March of the Penguins etc as already showing you some of this footage, please note that this was filmed well before MOTP was made.

Buy the original series if you like more narration, but otherwise simply sit back and enjoy the stunning photography.",1164844800,4,420,4.819444444444445
2494102,4,B000E5KQQ4,"It looks as if documentaries about Earth's life forms have become sub-genre for moviemaking. We have already seen fantastic documentaries like `Microcosmos' and `Winged Migration.' And as far as cinematography is concerned, `Deep Blue' is as beautiful as those films. The difference is that you might be less likely to be surprised by its content in spite of its wonderful images of dolphins, sea birds, whales, sea lions, penguins, and jelly-like creatures flashing blue in the deep ocean.

Don't get me wrong here because the marine images of the film are stunning. For those who love watching this kind of documentary film, however, some part of the film is no longer new and refreshing. Sea birds diving deep into the sea to catch fish would be an amazing image if you have not seen `Winged Migration.' Emperor penguins marching up the beach from the sea and standing in a group to survive a blizzard would be an astonishing scene if you have not seen `March of the Penguins.' And `March of the Penguins' would tell you more about the life of the penguins with its narration.

The film's strength lies in its editing, I think. Sometimes each vignette has a sort of short story (mainly about hunting) with George Fenton's gorgeous but slightly bombastic soundtrack. Still the breathtaking beauty of the images cannot be denied, and some creatures, those in Mariana Trench in particular, have totally different kind of beauty, very surreal and other-worldly one.

Finally I have to say some sections of the film may scare kids. What orca whales can do on the beach might be shocking to them (and adults too). Of course they kill to survive, but the point is how they kill. Just see it for yourself.

Though not informative as you might think, `Deep Blue' still offers a series of astonishing images about the animals and creatures living in the sea. The only thing I find disagreeable is its DVD cover. Why penguins? Unlike `March of the Penguins' you don't see many penguins here.",1164585600,16,1983,4.823529411764706
2494103,5,B000E5KQQ4,"If you're looking for a DVD with a storyline, look elsewhere.  Rather than a story, ""Deep Blue"" is a journey into a world of astonishing beauty and powerful predators.

Not always easy to watch but thoroughly engrossing, ""Deep Blue"" offers glimpses into the world of sea creatures I never knew existed.  And amazing perspectives not often found in nature photography.

Yes, the narrative is thin, but, honestly, who needs much narrative with cinematography like this?

Life is abundant in conditions I wouldn't have imagined could support life at all, and seeing the wierd and wonderful creatures who inhabit the deep gave me profound respect for the tenacity of life itself.  The additional piece on how the video was made (I often found myself wondering ""how did they do that?"") is icing on the cake.

An awesome journey into a beautiful world we don't often see -- Highly recommended!",1161907200,4,887,4.952702702702703
2494104,4,B000E5KQQ4,"(Before grousing, I'll say the cinematography in this film is mind-boggling, and it's wonderful to get such detailed and intimate images of wildlife in action)

J.R.R. Tolkien had enough respect for his own work that when ""The Hobbit"" was to be published back in 1938, he insisted on doing the illustrations himself (although he was no ""fine artist"") because he feared someone else would ""Disney-fy his characters."" I believe those are his exact words.

We're so accustomed to ""Disney-fying"" wildlife in our culture that we're often scarcely aware that there could be any issues connected with the procedure. This film is not as bad as most, although at times I sure worry about the very idea of making ""beauty"" and ""majesty"" and not merely ""cuteness"" criteria for appreciating nature. I think it misses the point--the point being ""respect"" for the system. Sometimes films like this take on the aura of a fashion show, or worse, a kind of eco-porn.

Other problems here include the mandatory great swooshing epic soundtrack--perfect for a film version of ""The Knights of the Round Table"" or some other fantasy. It tones down to creepy ""Night Music"" once we get to the bottom of the ocean, which hardly does justice to the fact that the creatures dwelling at the bottom of the sea don't notice anything spook-house about their surrounds--this is just the daily grind for them. What's happening before our eyes and ears here is an eco-system in action, which, with a proper and discreet narrative (instead of the Disney inspired ""storytelling"")and maybe <em>no</em> music, should arouse sufficient awe straight-up. Instead, we're confronted with nature as combined figure skating competition and action/drama.

Whenever I bellow about such things--and I'm no full-bore tree hugger but I was a serious documentary film student back in college days--my eco-friends respond by saying that at least films like this help make people aware of ecology issues. My response is that this approach to ""educating"" people is roughly analogous to arguing (back in the 1850's) that slavery is bad because Africans are majestic and beautiful, or, God save us, cute. I think we need to adopt a more adult perspective about our planet, rather than maintain the rather adolescent one that got us into trouble in the first place.

The second-worst part of the film was the abrupt, last minute, bare, and almost tacked-on ""nod"" to ecology issues. The filmmakers clearly didn't want to ruin your enjoyment of the pretty pictures by bringing this unpleasant stuff up midway through the epic, and the nod enabled back-porch environmentalists and maybe some teachers rationalizing info-tainment in their classrooms, to sleep comfortably after watching it.

The worst bit was the DVD cover package--one of the most cynical and deceptive marketing ploys I've ever encountered. There's very little penguin in this film--most of the action takes place under the sea with fish and marine mammals--but March of the Penguins was a huge hit...therefore.

I suggest buying this DVD and simply ditching the soundtrack and putting on some favorite music; Bach is perfect. It won't be a feel-good hot-tub epiphany but the images will still wow you.",1159056000,6,3209,5.136015325670498

My wife and I could not believe the footage here.  You have never seen any of this prior.  And the photography is stunning.  We were enthralled from start to finish, and agree that we could have put it in immediately thereafter and enjoyed it just as much.  The ""making of"" portion of the dvd is a great 45 minutes, allowing the viewer to really appreciate all of the work put into a film like this.

2494107,5,B000E5KQQ4,"There are scenes in this movie that will boggle your mind and stretch the limits of your imagination. As someone who loves watching nature documentaries, it's not often I see something that I have never seen before. This movie has at least a dozen of those moments.

There are several amazing sequences in this movie. One of killer whales beaching themselves to hunt seals along the shore is frightening and displays nature at it's rawest. Another of a pod of dozens of dolphins acrobatically flying out of the water and doing summersaults and spins for no apparent reason shows nature's playfullness.

But by far, the most amazing moments in this film are when it goes down into the deepest depths. Here the film shows creatures that are so bizarre, so beyong imagining, I began to wonder what else is out there. This 10 minute sequence alone is worth the price of admission. You won't be disappointed.",1155081600,6,903,4.782051282051282
2494108,5,B000E5KQQ4,"This is a stunning documentary about life in and by the oceans of the world. Narration is minimal, so you usually don't know where the footage is from - other than the ocean - but that really didn't bother me. I was enthralled from start to finish, even though I found the footage of the seal being caught in the surf by a killer whale and tossed into the air as the whale swam off with it, and another  part where three killer whales separated a baby whale from its mother by exhausting it and then killing it were sad is a little disturbing. Still, that's the way it is in nature, and it's all about staying alive one way or another. I agree that those two parts may be a bit too intense for little kids. It isn't gory or graphic (there is blood in the water), but it's very clear what is happening. It isn't Disney! Later in the film, spectacular footage is shown from the very depths of the ocean and the bizarre-looking creatures who live in total darkness. Simply amazing! The ""Making of"" feature on the DVD is almost as fascinating as the film itself, and gives a great deal of technical information about the filming process as well as personal insights from the filmmakers themselves.",1153612800,6,1193,4.422727272727273
2494109,4,B000E5KQQ4,"This documentary shows in beautiful detail different areas of the ocean, from the frozen Antarctic to the depths where no sunlight ever reaches.  Many fascinating species of fish and birds are shown, with their exotic shapes and colors too amazing to imagine.  I agree with the reviewers who say that a ""G"" rating is misleading, as several scenes could be upsetting to small children.  I also agree that more narration would be helpful, in order to identify different fish and learn what is going on in some of the shots.  The photography is beautiful and the background music is well done.",1148601600,,590,4.811881188118812
2494110,3,B000E5KQQ4,"As I watched this film, I realized I had seen much of it before, on my 4-disc collection Blue Planet, Seas of Life. That being said, Blue Planet is light years better than this feature-length dvd. The most memorable identical scenes include the grey whale/killer whale incident, as well as the footage in deep water of bioluminescent fish, plus the amazing critters surviving without any sunlight in the Marianas trench. I believe there are some other identical sections, though they escape me at the moment. If you don't want to spend the money for the Blue Planet collection, then this dvd will be ok. However, if you do buy Blue Planet, you will be treated to even more amazing ocean footage: a whole disc for coral reefs, a whole disc for coastal waters, a whole disc for deep ocean life, and a whole disc on arctic oceans life.

Not only does it show us the creatures we have seen before in grander, more beautiful ways, but we get to see many beautiful, alien-like, deep sea creatures that we haven't seen before. The music is beautiful and touching. When we spend our time for something, don't we want to be entertained, informed and hopefully learned something?
