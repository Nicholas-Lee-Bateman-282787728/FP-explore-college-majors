5549755,5,B00B1FMS94,"This set (probably the most unusual of Hanna-Barbera) has all 13 episodes of Ed Grimley. The animated portions of the episodes are fun for kids, but adults who like (and miss) SCTV may really appreciate the live action segments featuring Count Floyd (Joe Flaherty) and Catherine O' Hara-these portions are a riot. Andrea Martin (also of SCTV) provides various goofy voices reminiscent of Edith Prickley and Edna Boil.

Goofy and earnest-to-a-fault Ed Grimley lives with his goldfish and tries to be of assistance to his neighbors and just about anyone he runs into who needs help. My favorite episode is ""Good Neighbor Ed"", in which Ed tries getting photos of all his neighbors in the entire neighborhood. His landlord (Jonathan Winters) and his wife (Andrea Martin) bicker hilariously; then there's a live clip where Count Floyd tries to convince us that lounge singer Skippy High (Martin Short) is scary (he has a lisp and bores the children). The humor is goofy, basically SCTV in cartoon form. Martin Short is a riot when he plays multiple characters.

These episodes look (and sound) pretty good on dvd, though they're not in widescreen as they were created for television in the 1980's. There are no extras.",1359676800,15,1213,4.970443349753695
5549756,5,B00B1FMS94,I loved this back in the...80's? Whenever it was originally broadcast. Of course I loved a lot of crap that is just painful to watch now...not this show! Been hoping for a video release forever. Hilarious.,1359590400,7,205,4.722222222222222
5549787,5,B00B1FMS94,"Most of Hanna-Barberra's cartoons had a certain same-ness about them, but 'The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley' broke the mould. Always laugh heaps in each episode. Pity only 13 episodes were made.",1431302400,,211,5.424242424242424
5549788,5,B00B1FMS94,"""Back in the day"" when Ed Grimley had his own Saturday morning cartoon show (remember them?) I used to watch it with my young son whenever I had a Saturday morning off.  Since I traveled for a living I couldn't be home every Saturday to watch these with him, so he took it upon himself to tape the show on our VCR (remember those?) and we'd watch the recordings together after I got home.  Pretty soon, he had all the episodes taped for me on the same tape thanks to reruns, and that's one of the few VHS tapes I cherish to this day. The release of this DVD means I can now see our friend Ed Grimley as much as I like without harming our precious VHS collector tape.  It's a very funny show, mixing live and cartoon action in every episode...a veritable Second City reunion at every turn.  Martin Short is insane, but not as insane as I am when I enjoy these cartoons at my advanced age (Hey, nobody ever said I had to grow up!).  Highly recommended for children of every age.",1429056000,,976,4.225806451612903
5549789,4,B00B1FMS94,"I like Martin Short (he does the worlds best Jerry Lewis impression and Jimminy Glick is awesome also) but the best reasons to check this series out are the consistently hilarious ""Count Floyd's Scary Stories"" segments. They come on at the 10-minutes-before-the-end mark. I loved Floyd on SCTV and was delighted when he appeared live on Grimley. I am convinced Joe Flaherty always improvised the Count. Of course you can find the SCTV collections and catch the best of our favorite horror host: 3D House of Beef, 3D House of Slave Chicks and Midnight Cowboy in 3D. OWOOOOOOoooOOOO!!",1426723200,,582,4.948979591836735
5549790,4,B00B1FMS94,"Fans of Martin Short's portrayal of super nerd Ed Grimley on Saturday Night Live will love this animated series from the late 1980's based on the Grimley character.  The Ed Grimley animated shorts are frenetic and full of sly Hollywood references and hysterical non-sequiturs.  Particularly funny is the episode where Grimley finds himself traveling with Hilary Black Smythe, the famous missing aviatrix and Katharine Hepburn sound-alike (Ed: "" Who are you?""  Hilary: ""Good question!  But does anyone ever really know who anyone is?""). The Amazing Gustav Brothers animated segments are also amusing and reminiscent of Peabody and Sherman cartoons from the 60s.  Count Floyd is the live action segment of the show that is lame but inoffensive. The main flaw with this package is the poor sound quality.  I have found myself straining to hear Martin Short's voice over the music and other FX in some episodes and have had to turn the volume up in order to hear the voiceover tracks.",1424649600,,980,5.018518518518518
5549791,5,B00B1FMS94,"Oh my! I must say!! The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley is one of those rare cartoons that only comes around once! Based on Martin Short's SCTV and SNL character of the same name, kids could follow the wacky adventures of Ed Grimley while enjoying a big bowl of cereal on  Saturday morning! This DVD set brought back a lot of memories and a lot of laughs! Enjoy, the tuna casserole awaits!",1423440000,,403,4.52054794520548
5549792,1,B00B1FMS94,I was so disappointed - I thought this was going to be clips from Saturday Night Live. I got it for the adults in my family for Chrismtas. We all got together to watch it - it is a kids movie. And not a very good one.,1419984000,,217,3.6382978723404253

5549796,3,B00B1FMS94,"I am mexican and the original voices are ok, but all Latin America originally saw the show with the spanish translation unfortunately they decided not to include it, it's really a pity! I guess it was expensive to include other languages, I hope the release soon a version with other languages (including the spanish one).",1404518400,2,322,4.872727272727273
5549817,5,B00B1FMS94,"I'm so happy I finally found and purchased a legitimate complete collection of the Ed Grimley cartoon. It was quite possibly the weirdest thing on Saturday morning at the time. No one understood why I liked it, I just did. Now, I can share it with my future children, as one of daddy's favorite cartoons from when he was a boy.

A word of warning before purchasing, however. If you primarily watch DVDs in an XBOX 360, or similar early-gen console, the DVD-R discs will not work in them. You will need a regular DVD player for your TV, or one in a computer.

The show itself is awesome, and I'm glad to watch it whenever I want, now.",1401753600,,633,4.310924369747899
5549818,4,B00B1FMS94,"My now mid-30's kids used to HOWL at the live version of EG as portrayed by Martin Short. I've never actually seen the animated version until it arrived from amazon.  It does bring back memories, y'know, frenetic, rapid-fire, over-the-top.  Kind of nostalgic, I must say.
The inclusion of Count Flloyd, and the voice of Andrea Martin were, I thought, a nice touch.  But my two adolescent kids, with a totally different frame of reference, are not impressed, which is sad...
Definitely worth having a few, if you're old enough to remember the 80's. Does that sound Mental?",1395878400,4,571,4.865979381443299
5549819,5,B00B1FMS94,I stumbled on this series and loved it from the beginning -- the lineup of voices from Second City plus the incomparable Jonathan Winters really made this cartoon series enjoyable for children and adults alike. I waited many years for the series to be available on DVD and am so happy to add it to my collection.,1394409600,2,312,4.491228070175438
5549820,5,B00B1FMS94,"If you remember the series from the 80s you don't need a review. It is as wacky as I remember, not I am passing on my childhood joy to my kids. They love it.",1391472000,5,157,3.6470588235294117
5549821,1,B00B1FMS94,I accidentally ordered this DVD thinking it would be sketches of Martin Short similar to those on SNL (since SNL was mentioned on the backside). Instead it's a Martin Short cartoon series. Disappointing that the seller won't accept a return - only if defective. Not happy and won't order from them in the future.,1389484800,,312,4.796296296296297
5549822,4,B00B1FMS94,"So much of Hanna Barbera's output in the 70s and 80s was such dreck, that it seems miraculous to come across a show that was so innovative and quirky and genuinely funny.  I mean, seriously, how often, as an adult, do Hanna Barbera cartoons actually make you laugh?  The credit for this state of affairs can be laid at the feet (and brains) of the cast members of SCTV, who did kind of a last hurrah with this show.  Featuring Martin Short's signature character Ed Grimley, a hyperkinetic nerd, it also included the regular appearances of Joe Flaherty as Count Floyd in live action inserts, the voice (and one-time live appearance) of Catherine O'Hara who plays Ed's ""love"" interest, Miss Malloy, and frequent use of Andrea Martin as Ed's landlady - - - Ed's Landlord is voiced by the great Jonathan Winters.  Dave Thomas is a particularly welcome guest voice in an episode where he does his spot-on Bob Hope impersonation.
Each show is a typical ""situation"" comedy episode, with Ed going to another planet, being left in charge of the apartment while his landlords go on vacation, searching (a-la ""Finding Nemo"") for his pet goldfish Moby;  the episodes work mainly as a framework for some absurd and unexpected moments of what sounds like improv-ed comedy.  Martin voices some of his signature characters, Katherine Hepburn, Bette Davis and Jackie Rogers Jr, as well as many other incidental parts.  Catherine O'Hara's Miss Malone is done in her ""bad actress"" voice; she's constantly auditioning for parts in TV movies with titles like ""Tell the Conductor to Stop his Machine!"".  Her little brother Wendell is voiced by Danny Cooksey.  Andrea's Mrs Freebis is a variation on her Edna Boyle voice.  Jonathan Winters adds his own endless font of characters to the mix.
Although it's great to see Joe Flaherty in his Count Floyd persona, sometimes I wish he didn't go on for quite so long.  Still, many of his ""scary"" stories are illustrated by different styles of animation, which must have been fun for the animators.  There's also a recurring segment with 2 scientists, ""The Amazing Gustave Brothers"", attempting to teach a scientific principal that has some bearing on the episode.  These feel like a slightly subversive take on the notion that all cartoons had to be educational, since most of what they teach is pretty questionable.  There is great give and take between Martin and Jonathan Winters in these bits.
My only gripe is there were no extras included.  A commentary or mini documentary would have been most appreciated.
Sadly (and not too surprisingly) the show only lasted one season, but I think it's worth getting.  Again, there is more humor in this little gem than in all the Scooby Doos put together.",1370217600,2,2721,4.869848156182212
5549823,5,B00B1FMS94,"This was such a great show. I loved watching this on Saturday mornings, for the short time it was on tv. It's so awesome that it's finally available on DVD. Thank you for a great product.",1366156800,2,187,4.222222222222222
5549824,5,B00B1FMS94,I love Ed Grimley. My husband and I have waited for this for almost 2 decades. Finding it released was fantastic.,1365292800,7,113,4.428571428571429
5549825,5,B00B1FMS94,"I never thought I'd see this on DVD, but thanks to Warner Archive, and whatever serendipitous happenings, here it is. If there's a drawback to the WA DVD-R sets, it's that Amazon doesn't mark them down, but, amazing as it seems, in this case they have (who knows how long that may last?). The top-notch packaging matches the Hanna-Barbera Golden Collection. Inside, you just get the two, one-sided DVD-R discs snapped into the case. No booklet. You have to slip the disc in your DVD or Blu-Ray player to see the contents, and it's sad there are no extras. But there is art on both discs.

The good news is that here are thirteen great episodes of this quirky show. I might have a bone to pick with some of the writers/ storyboarders (although not nearly as much as on shows like Animaniacs. Why do the villains have to be caricatures of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby? Nevertheless, this show, made in conjunction with Colossal Pictures, which did MTV's Liquid Television, was in every way a breath of fresh air when it first hit the airwaves in 1988. Its enormously clever combination of live action (Count Floyd, and occasionally Martin Short in a cameo), and animation are wonderfully handled.

I have to agree with another reviewer that the episode, ""Good Neighbor Ed"" is a high point. The writing is about ten times better than most of the episodes, even though most of the show's writing is at least OK (not nearly as uneven as many recent cartoon series, in which episodes  vary widely depending who wrote or storyboarded them). This show obviously doesn't take itself too seriously, and it doesn't try too hard. It avoids the strident voice and over-acting that have come to plague modern TV. Ed is nothing if not subtle. And likable. And clever. SCTV's talented cast glides seamlessly into animation. No wonder this is a cult classic. It's truly a high point of late '80s animation. How can you say it's not?",1363564800,10,1911,4.681547619047619
