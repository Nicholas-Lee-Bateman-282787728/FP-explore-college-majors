3417184,4,B0018CWEUI,"BE FOREWARNED:  only in the very, very small print on the DVD box, and nowhere in the item descriptions, do you learn that this DVD only has five episodes on it.  Definitely overpriced for the number of episodes.  Otherwise, I'd have given this item five stars, because the show is fantastic.  The writing is amazing, the plots are clever, and even the recurrent gags never seem to get old.  Five stars for the show, but not for the DVD.",1219968000,4,437,4.481012658227848
3417185,5,B0018CWEUI,"This DVD contains 112 minutes (7 episodes) of the cartoon. including my favorite episode ""Lights, Candace, Action"".  Plus special features-original storyboards and games.

If you could distill out the clever irreverent wit and the ""something for all ages"" mix of gags and references from ""Family Guy"", ""The Simpsons"", ""SpongeBob"", and South Park""; and then jettison all the off-color, negative, and crude low-hanging fruit elements of those cartoons you would get something like The Disney Channel's ""Phineas and Ferb"" which premiered in August 2007.

The title characters, non-stop talker Phineas (Vincent Martella) and his usually silent brother Ferb (Thomas Sangster) are suburban stepbrothers trying to make the most of their summer vacation. This means constructing elaborate gadgets like a time machine and a roller- coaster, or making a feature film. They are usually assisted by an industrious group of Camp Fire Girls (Fireside Girls) led by their neighbor Isabella (Alyson Stoner) who has a major crush on Phineas. The brothers are just trying to have a fun summer, they aren't trying to cause trouble or be cool, and they are at that age where boys are not even conscious of girls or of who is popular.

Typically their teenage sister Candace (Ashley Tisdale) gets reluctantly drawn into their projects as she strives to keep them from embarrassing her in front of her crush Jeremy (Mitchell Musso). Each storyline has her trying to ""bust them"" by phoning their mother about the latest home project, but by the time Mom gets home all evidence has conveniently vanished. Although there is a sibling rivalry the three obviously care about each other. Candace is the best part of the series and Tisdale does unexpectedly well supplying her voice; the part is very challenging, as the mercurial Candace requires a wide range of intonations and energy levels in her voice.

Although the series could get by just cutting between Candace and her brothers, it ups the energy level each episode with a ""Kim Possible"" type parallel story involving the family's pet platypus Perry (he's a semi-aquatic, egg-laying, mammal of action). Perry is a secret agent assigned to foil the plots of evil (but hopelessly inept) scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz (co- creator Dan Povenmire).

The animation style is the same simplistic stuff (Phineas' head is a triangle) found in the other four cartoon series although like ""SpongeBob"" the occasional ""real-life"" photo is thrown into the mix. For the benefit of boy viewers, a more serious drawing style is devoted to one of the minor characters, Dr. Doofenshmirtz's beautiful daughter Veronica (Olivia Olson). She is a goth version of Dr. Dome's daughter Lynx from DC's 1960's ""Plastic Man"" comics. Doofenshmirtz owes a lot to Dr. Dome who billed himself ""King of the Cruel"".

""Phineas and Ferb"" might be the all-time best ""compromise"" cartoon; incorporating many subtle elements for adult viewers while relying on its absurdist humor and identification elements to hook both pre-teens and teens.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1217548800,14,3082,5.187122736418511
3417186,5,B0018CWEUI,"I love the show alot. The bonus episode on the DVD is very cool. There is only one part that scared me on the bonus episode called ""One Good Scare Ought To Do It"". After the haunted house is being carried away by Doofenshmirtz's escape jet (after blowing up his mentor's base) Phineas is still inside and falls out and I thought he was going to die (until Isabella and the Fireside Girls use thier sashes as a net to catch him). Other than that a great DVD and great episodes. Overall rating 10-10",1217462400,2,497,4.297872340425532

4. Flop Starz
5. Raging Bully

3417188,1,B0018CWEUI,I absolutely love this show and so do my two five year olds and eight year old.  The problem is that this is only five of the shows and some extras and there are a LOT more that have been shown-probably around 23...I know because they are all on my DVR.  The one star is for this not being a Season 1 Box set.  I don't want Disney to suck me in to this small selection and not put out (or worse put out once I buy this) a full season box set.  Come on Disney. Don't rip off your fans of this show...put out the whole box set.  This show rocks!  And that's from a 47 year old!,1217289600,51,575,3.7899159663865545

The two step-brothers get a long great. Bored, they seek out adventures. Only their sister isn't too keen on the idea of them getting away with as much as they do and does whatever she can to try to spoil things. Only her every attempt to get them into trouble backfires and her mother begins to worry that she just might be a little, well...crazy.",1217203200,9,510,4.378947368421053

My 5 y/o My 2 Y/o my 35 y/o husband and myself (34 y/o) all sit and watch it together. We laugh at the same things (for different reasons sometims) and can enjoy the DVD together. The humor is layered, with visual comedy for the kids and adult verbal jokes (the kids think it's funny because the characters say it, the adults think it's funny because we understand the real meaning. Plenty of episodes to enjoy and great music. These are the older episodes, from 2008, but it makes no difference. We all can watch this DVD over and over again. And, I will admit it, I watch it without the kids. Quite entertaining and well worth the money. We are well on our way to owning the entire series.",1315785600,2,812,4.3841059602649
3417235,3,B0018CWEUI,"First of all, the actual content on the DVD is stellar. There's no question about that. Anybody who has seen even one episode of Phineas & Ferb will tell you it's a great show enjoyed literally by folks of all ages (parents included). The bonus features are a fine addition as well, appealing to kids and die-hard collectors and fans.

That said, Disney's presentation and execution of the DVD is rather poor. The DVD begins with a block of unskippable previews, and thanks to Disney's familiar heavy lock-down system, it's difficult to bypass them even through watching it on the computer. That same lock-down also makes it hard to manually rip the episodes for use in non-commercial fan-created content (music videos, screenshot collages, etc), one of the primary reasons I purchase things on DVD.

As others have noted, it's also a shame that there are only a handful of episodes on this set. Full season releases would suit us all so much better, but Disney chose to release the show in limited volumes, and as such, fans and collectors will have to wait or be happy with what we've got thus far.

I wouldn't rate the actual episodes anything less than 5 stars, believe me. Phineas & Ferb is chock full of brilliant writing, clever and melodic songs, and an incredibly engaging voice cast. But the presentation really makes this DVD a bittersweet collector's item. Disney knows its audiences will buy the product regardless though, since Phineas & Ferb is indeed one of their biggest smash franchises (and continually growing bigger!), so our collective disappointment with said presentation will fall on deaf ears.

Here's to hoping at least some of these annoyances will not be present in future releases.",1312156800,6,1711,4.9100346020761245

------------------------------------------------------------
This is a fun TV series, but it's too bad that Disney only has a handful of episodes available on DVD. We don't get cable, so for us it sure would be nice if they'd put out full ""Season One"" and ""Season Two"" collections, rather than just these semi-random DVD releases with only five episodes per disc. Sigh. I'm sure they'll get around to it someday in the distant future, but my kid'll have outgrow the show by then. (Axton)",1289088000,2,538,4.923076923076923
3417240,5,B0018CWEUI,"As the parent of three young children, I appreciate those cartoons and children's shows that are written both to entertain kids and their parents.  As a boy, I used to watch Bugs Bunny, which I realized, as I got older, was written on two levels ... slapstick humor for kids and wry asides for adults.  As a young and then an increasingly older adult, I enjoyed other shows that could entertain both audiences ... shows such as ""Ren and Stimpy"" (although perhaps a bit violent for some children), ""Rugrats"", and ""Jimmy Neutron"", among others.

I recently discovered ""Phineas and Ferb"" on the Disney Channel, or should I say my kids did.  They requested more episodes to watch, so I bought this DVD, which contains close to 2 hours of entertainment.  Although the format is somewhat repetitive (Phineas and Ferb build something ingenious and way-over-the-top item in their back yard while their sister Candace tries and fails to get the boys in trouble by squealing to their parents, while their pet Perry the Platypus, who lives a double life as a secret agent, foils the plans of evil-doer Dr. Doofenshmirtz), each show is inventive, fresh, and funny.  While my kids are enthralled, often one of my children will ask me ""What are you laughing at, Daddy?"", so it indeed works for multiple audiences.  Each show also features a song or two, many of which are so catchy that they could be top 40 pop hits (some even have my 5 year old son dancing, and he doesn't dance.)  :-)

My more staid wife was getting a little concerned that I was happily watching a kiddie show, until she sat down and watched a few episodes.  Now she's a fan, too.

I simply  enjoy myself so much watching the adventures of this two brothers in Danville that now I am humming all the time the opening song, much to my nieces delight.

Phineas and Ferb are brothers  living through the longest summer ever recorded on tv. Everyday  they  have a plan to spend the day doing something amusing, entertaining or simply adventurous, helped by the brave and oh-so-much-in-love-with-Phineas Isabella and her Fireside Girls Troop 46231. Their great plans are spied by their sister Candance, your average teen elder sister who apart form the plans of her brothers is  obssessed with  catching the eye of Jeremy. We have the best secret agent, above 007 I must say, who is  Perry the platypus , constantly fighting against our full of childhood traumas  Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz. The best maker of nators  who ever existed.

Honestly I cannot say which is my favourite episode because each one is better.
Flop Star is probably one of my favourites, because  it is probably the best resume I have seen of the  music industry. Not to mention the catchy song ;)

Of course Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo cannot be mised. It has one of the best time-travel stories I have ever seen. Not to mention that little glimpse into the future of our  heroes and a misterious hint  about Isabella's unrequited love.

It is funny with good timing and very clever.  The music is cute and catchy...my daughter can sing the entire ""one hit wonder""...gitchy, gitchy, goo means I love you...which is very cute!

3417252,5,B0018CWEUI,"We (husband and two sons who are now 3 and 4) originally started watching this show on the Disney Channel, but that just wasn't enough. We found ourselves DVRing episodes so we could rewatch them over and over again.

My husband and I really appreciate kids' shows that have a little something for the parents, Phineas and Ferb fit the bill for sure. We LOVE Doofenshmirz and the songs are hilarious and original. 'Squirrels in my Pants' is my favorite one.

We (I say we, but it was really my older son) received this DVD as a birthday present. We watch this DVD more than any other DVD in our collection. It beats out Toy Story, Monsters Inc, The Incredibles... you name it, our kids will pick P&F over it anytime.

In fact, we're watching it now. Order this DVD!",1244332800,,765,4.45
3417253,5,B0018CWEUI,"Whether you are a kid, a kid at heart or the parent of a kid...you will enjoy this collection of Phineas & Ferb episodes. It contains good clean humor suitable for all ages. But make no mistakes...this is an animated series that adults will find is geared as much for them as younger ages. Phineas & Ferb and their wild one-day exploits are very entertaining but it is their wonderful pet platypus, named Perry, who provides a running background story in each episode that steals the show. Perry is a hero at my house. And if you stop by, don't be afraid to ask, ""Whatcha doing?"" because most likely it's watching Phineas & Ferb.",1240185600,,629,4.526315789473684
3417254,5,B0018CWEUI,"I'm a sucker for this show. Why?

The song ""Gitchie Gitchie Goo"" is a reference to the Jetsons' ""Eep Opp Ork Ah Ah.""

The Mummy and Me song comes from ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father"" and Harry Nillson's wonderful version of ""Best Friend"" even down to the intonation.

In """"Getting the Band Back Together"" - the drummer has gone to work in a library, forgetting his glory days of being in a band. This is exactly what happened to Arthur ""Killer"" Kane after the breakup of the first punk/glam band, The New York Dolls. To find out what happened to Kane, watch the heartbreaking documentary ""New York Doll.""

And, can you think of some other musical trio with an egotistical bassist that had broken up? (Hint: their name starts with the words ""The Police.""

Who's the boys' mom? A washed up one hit wonder that's modeled on someone like Tiffany. There was the brilliant episode where someone recognized her briefly, and she reminisced on her brief, meteoric career.

Combine this with references to James Bond, Green Acres, and a million other little things that could use a quick cultural jab - and you've got a fabulous cartoon. And kids might like it too...

3417257,5,B0018CWEUI,"I dislike much children's television programming today.  Much of it purports to be educational when it is not, and most of it is either vapid or boring.  This show is proudly none of those things, and my seven year old can watch it as well as my husband and I with the same level of enjoyment.

My daughter enjoys it because it is just all out funny.  The situations are sometimes absurd, and she appreciates the novelty of it.  She also enjoys that the plot sticks to a basic organizational pattern each time: Phineas and Ferb are left in the care of their older sister Candace, who tries to ""bust"" them with their out of hand projects.  Their pet platypus Perry (or Agent P as his alter ego) sneaks off to foil the evil plans of Dr. Doofenschmirtz, and in the process destroys or removes all evidence of Phineas and Ferb's project just as their parents arrive home.  Formulaic?  Yes, but barely.

My husband and I like it because even though it follows a formula, the show rarely feels this way.  The creativity of the boys is astounding, the ridiculousness of Dr. Doofenschmirtz's plans is sublime, and Candace is such a textbook tween/teen character that she is hysterical. Subtle humor abounds, and Gen X parents will definitely pick up on cultural nods and references that kids may miss.  Only in a cartoon could these ideas work fully, and Phineas and Ferb comes off as fresh and engaging where most children's shows fall short.

In short, Disney got this one right.",1231286400,7,1473,4.623076923076923

My 2 year old son loves this show, and I find myself chuckling along. I've had a hard time finding the show on physical copies, which is still my preference for movies, but between this and the ""Daze of Summer"" mix we have a fair amount of shows to keep it interesting.

If you haven't seen the show yet, I really do recommend it. It's fun for the sake of being fun, and that's all too rare these days.",1517875200,,517,4.068627450980392
