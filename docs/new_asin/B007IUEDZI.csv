8517961,5,B007IUEDZI,"Nova covers and compares the sinking of two ships:  the Titanic and Costa Concordia, which was actually beached and did not sink.  But it did strike a rock and did manage to roll on its side and kill 32 passengers.

The program begins by comparing the technology of the times.  When Titanic was made in Ireland the metallurgy was primitive and they have found -- they have sheared bolts from the ship recovered from the bottom of the Atlantic -- that they were higher in sulfur and phosphorus, both of which weaken the alloy.  They show experts testing them to destruction -- they pulled on them until they broke.  The bolts that matched Titanic's were 7 times weaker than those used today.  The iceberg that hit Titanic sheared bolts off and peeled the iron plates away, allowing water to pour into the ship.  She was doomed.

Costa Concordia ran into a rock made of granite; that too peeled away a lot of the hull.  The captain was navigating by sight and simply got too close to shore while trying to show the sights to his passengers.

The show turns to the captains' behavior next.  Captain Smith of Titanic has been both criticized and praised:  they did send for help immediately; the crew, many of them doomed, tried to fill the lifeboats with people, though a number did not get filled.  Why that happened has been the center of many a debate:  they may have been overly concerned about panic and hence tried to keep people away from the lifeboats.

Nova interviewed a few experts on people under stress and one of them is convinced that both captains, of Titanic and Costa Concordia, panicked and simply couldn't really function as they normally would.  Perhaps.

One problem with modern cruise ships is the lack of sailors, real sailors, onboard -- people who know how to handle a ship.  While many of the crew of Titanic worked to the end to save passengers and went down with the ship, the captain of Concordia left the ship and refused to go back.  There have been other such cases, covered by Nova here, in which entire crews have abandoned the ship and left the passengers to their own devices.

They also interviewed an ex-captain who runs a simulator for sea captains and he notes that they are not required by law to attend such things; airline pilots are required to have special training by law.  The maritime industry is woefully behind the airline industry.

I found this to be a very good program; could it have been better?  Anything can be improved.  But, at the end of the day, they show the problems with the cruise industry very well indeed.  Cruise ships certainly have a lot going for them, but safety should be improved.",1422576000,,2652,4.601279317697228
8517962,3,B007IUEDZI,"I am generally a fan of ""Nova"" and when I saw ""Why Ships Sink"" I was hoping it would be along the lines of the much earlier and excellent ""Why Planes Crash."" Unfortunately ""Why Ships Sink"" has fewer genuine experts interviewed with less commentary that's genuinely relevant to the science or safety issues involved. Without actually using a stopwatch, I would guess that the most screen time for any interviewee is with Jim Walker, a maritime attorney. While there's certainly a place for lawyers in technical fields, rarely do they have the greatest grasp of the engineering, safety, and human factors issues involved though they do frequently have a litigation-based viewpoint that may not be obvious to casual viewers. I have worked extensively in aviation safety, and was pleased with the selection of aviation experts ""Nova"" chose for ""Why Planes Crash."" Here the experts interviewed basically tell us what crews did wrong and that despite an excellent overall safety record, that cruise ships are becoming less safe by virtue of increasing size (though little of technical merit is cited to buttress this viewpoint.) I am in no way related to the cruise industry and don't claim to know the answers to the questions raised here, but while the questions are legitimate (e.g. are bigger cruise ships leading to lower safety margins?) the answers given are largely opinion. While expert opinion is significant, the show largely uses the grounding of the ""Costa Concordia"" as evidence of the safety ills of the industry. Indeed there is much to loathe in the sinking of the ""Concordia,"" but the bad judgment of one officer (Captain Francesco Schettino, who willfully endangered his ship, crew, and passengers by flagrantly disregarding Costa policy and procedure and then abandoned ship before ensuring the evacuation was complete) does not negate the positive safety records and attitudes found throughout the industry. Some of the conclusions drawn in the program (by ""Nova"" and the experts alike) seem patently ridiculous and serve to make me more skeptical of the quality of other conclusions drawn that seem more plausible. For instance, the show concludes that Schettino was inexperienced. He may have made a series of bad decisions on the ""Concordia"" off Giglio, but he was hardly inexperienced. After completing his formal nautical training he served as an officer on ferries and oil tankers for 30 years (some tankers dwarf ""Concordia,"" though I don't know what the largest tanker he worked aboard was) prior to being hired by Costa. After employment by Costa he served on their ships for four years before being promoted to Captain. That's 34 years of large vessel experience prior to taking command of ""Concordia,"" which he commanded for several years prior to the accident. Whatever Schettino was, he wasn't inexperienced despite the assertions from ""Nova"" and attorney Jim Walker, both of whom treat experience prior to Costa as seemingly nontransferable. The show correctly highlights the advances commercial aviation has in training over the maritime industry, citing mandatory simulator training, etc. While it's true that aviation is largely ahead of the shipping industries in training and the use of simulators, 34 years of professional flying would make a very experienced pilot in anyone's book, even if some of it was obtained in previous jobs or the military.

This episode tries too hard to bookend 100 years of maritime safely neatly between the ""Titanic"" and ""Concordia"" accidents, and focuses on those two accidents with passing mention of a few less well known sinkings in between (though other compelling safety lessons from accidents such as the ""Andrea Doria"" and ""Herald of Free Enterprise"" go unmentioned.) The parallels the show seeks to draw between ""Titanic"" and ""Concordia"" are tenuous at best, irrelevant at worst, and a distraction to be sure. The sinking of the ""Costa Concordia"" is the most recent major casualty in the cruise industry and as such has exposed problems that need to be addressed. That's a positive thing, and will enable the cruise lines to run even safer operations. What isn't stated but needs to be is that the behavior of Schettino on the ""Concordia"" is the outlier, and is his failings are not necessarily an indictment of the industry as a whole. ""Why Ships Sink"" was no doubt a ratings booster, has moments of insight, and is occasionally compelling, but fails to buttress its premises sufficiently to be considered a rigorous work.",1398556800,,4498,5.136425648021828
8517963,3,B007IUEDZI,"Not enough history or facts in this presentation.  This DVD reflects current news media tactics; a lot of sensationalism and no story
to tell.",1385251200,,142,4.916666666666667
8517964,5,B007IUEDZI,"My wife and I have cruised the world and will continue to enjoy cruising as long as we can. This movie has several key bits of information that every cruiser should see. We did benefit by watching this DVD. I will not spoil the content by revealing the details, but if you are thinking about a cruise, this DVD has key information that they do not tell you aboard ship.",1381363200,,369,4.285714285714286
8517965,4,B007IUEDZI,"The largest cruise ships today carry 6,500 passengers and 2,000 crew, few of whom are professional sailors. Recently the 114,000 ton Cost Concordia sank in 2012, almost 100 years after the 45,000 ton Titanic in 1912. Both involved egregious errors by their captains - Smith of the Titanic ignored warnings of ice in the Titanic's path and failed to expedite abandoning ship as well as assuring lifeboats were filled. The Concordia's captain seemingly took the ship on a 'joyride' too close to shore, delayed giving direction and information after the accident, and abandoned ship prior to most of the passengers. (The 'good news' is that he did maneuver the ship closer to shore so that it sank in very shallow water.)

Today's ship-building steels test at 7X stronger than those of the Titanic; another Titanic problem was its use of rivets, not as strong as today's welding. Regardless, no technology now exists that can withstand hitting rocks or icebergs.

Both ships had double hulls, but this safety feature did no good because that feature only protected the ship's bottom. Today's tankers have double hulls all the way up to the waterline. The Titanic's 'watertight compartments' only extended partway up to the steel overhead, rendering them useless; today's compartmentation has corrected that error.

Ships today are up to 20 stories (230 feet) high, making them less prone to causing sea-sickness but also more unstable in rough waters or high winds. Amazingly, training captains on simulators is voluntary, compared to mandatory for pilots. This has created, per some experts, a problem with captains in distress becoming mentally overloaded and unable to react.

Two items were particularly amazing. The first was the story of a professional musician who'd been working on two ships that sank, and played key roles in rescuing those aboard. In the first (Oceanana), he was the first non-sailor to investigate and realize the ship was sinking (due to a valve stuck in the open position) and the professional crew had fled. He then called for help and assisted everyone off via helicopters. The second was the frequency of Carnival Cruise Line ships encountering serious problems - these included a 2009 collision in waters near Mexico, another vessel in 2010 that injured 20 passengers when it had to make a sudden sharp turn, and of course the 2012 Costa Concordia in Italy. Since then four more Carnival ships have incurred significant problems - mostly involving eg. engine room fires that left the ship w/o any backup power.",1364860800,,2541,5.086330935251799
8517966,5,B007IUEDZI,"Not a video for those who like to cruise without worry, but definitely for those who want to know the risks of the new ships and how previous ships sunk. Scientific, not gruesome. VERY well done",1344470400,2,194,4.416666666666667
8517967,3,B007IUEDZI,"I've been on quite a few cruises and I'm not sure I'd want to see the episode of the PBS show NOVA just before I left on vacation. But, as cruise ships keep getting larger and larger and, more importantly, taller and taller, the safety of cruising is an issue. In reality cruising may be the safest way to travel if you ""read between the lines"" while watching this 50-minute documentary.

The majority of the show deals with two cruise ship disasters that occurred exactly 100 years apart. In 1912 the Titanic sank and there were no survivors. In early January 2012 the Costa Concordia also hit a rock but all except for 38 passengers survived. It's a tragedy that the 38 lost their lives - primarily due to the ship's captain who delayed informing passengers for a full hour and then abandoned the ship himself. - but there were 4.200 passengers and crew on board.

There are no archival films of the Titanic disaster so NOVA uses recreations and photos. Since the Concordia got a lot of press coverage, there is plenty of video footage taken on board and at least three couples who were on board are interviewed.

We do learned about the training of pilots and the construction of ship hulls but less time is spent on explaining WHY a ship sinks than on the personal stories of what happens to the passengers when it does. I found this a weakness in the otherwise NOVA series.

In the case of the Concordia, the trial has yet to begin but the sinking was obviously do to one person: the ship's captain.

I think those who, like me, take cruises would benefit from watching the show if only to remind them to know where their life jackets and life boat station are BEFORE the ship leaves dock.

There are no bonus features on this DVD.

I hope this review was both informative and helpful.
