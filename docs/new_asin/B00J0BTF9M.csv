His love for his family and especially his parents; was heart touching. I got to meet him at his backstage performance of AN EVENING WITH BURT REYNOLDS in Asheville, N.C. and you will never meet a more down to earth, caring, funny man than Burt. He's not the ""STAR"" you can't touch. He is one of us, he just happened to make movies for a living. He has had major health problems years ago. Being a stunt man, caused much pain and agony for all the years he continued to do stunts. I hate that he has to suffer, he gave us all an escaped from our daily problems, when we watched his movies.
Burt you will always be #1 in my book.",1427673600,,738,4.1678321678321675
8647064,5,B00J0BTF9M,"i agree, it is a very sweet movie and i think that it speaks very well of Mr. Reynolds to have accepted this role. Even in earlier days, when he played womanizers he had a very own and sensitive sense of humor i always liked. But to my opinion his star role was in ""Waterproof"".
Anyway as sweet as this movie was it was not very realistic, when it came to greyhounds. Uninformed people might think that a rescued greyhound makes a good therapy dog right away! Also it is good to remember that they have a very strong drive to chase! But with loving care they will be great dogs. And certainly should be rescued!",1421020800,2,611,4.275862068965517
