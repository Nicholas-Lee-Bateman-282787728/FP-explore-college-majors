1205222,4,B00000F9I1,"This appears to be the old B&W movie with Virginia McKenna and Peter Finch. A very good but dated movie based on the wonderful Neville Shute book.

The Australian TV mini-series is light years better - in fact is one of the greatest movies ever made.

I hope some day it's released on DVD. Until then I still have my old VHS copy.",1135900800,63,330,4.222222222222222
1205223,5,B00000F9I1,"This is a very interesting and well written mini-series from Australia that tells the story of a group of Australian and British women and children who are captured by the Japanese at the outbreak of WW2. Separated from their husbands, they are forced to march many miles to the prison camp. Without food or medicine, they suffer many hardships. They run across a couple of Aussie POW's who give them some food. After the war one of the women goes back tho the hometown of one of the men. A not to be missed program. NOT for the faint of heart or for younger children. Stars Bryan Brown as one of the POW's.",1133049600,11,607,4.380530973451328

1205320,4,B00000F9I1,"This is a good version of the book and movie but really a teaser.  The acting and photography are professional and story line is accurate.  But it ends about half or two thirds thru the book and the Australian mini-series.  So you miss everything that happens when she goes to Australia, which is a lot!  I bought this because it's very hard to find the mini-series on DVD, it's out there but expensive.  I bought this just as a substitute.  The book is awesome and could be taught on many levels.  I can't wait for the full DVD to be released.  I probably would have given this 3.5 stars because it is cut short.",1482710400,,613,4.315789473684211
1205321,2,B00000F9I1,"1956 B&W.This movie is TERRIBLE.  I like the book & 1981 miniseries not yet streaming (Amazon are,you listening?). A very dear, based on actual occurrences, story written just after Neill Shute moved to Australia.

This movie left Much out or changed for 50s dramatic effect. Stereotyped Japanese characters, not as good as 1981. At all.

Amazon, please make the 1981 miniseries available. IT follows the book almost word for word.

From the book:
""in Sumatra. Mrs. Geysel had been a member of that party. When she was taken prisoner she was a slight, pretty girl of twenty-one, recently married; she had a baby six months old, and a very robust sense of humour. In the years that followed Mrs. Geysel marched over twelve hundred miles carrying her baby, in circumstances similar to those which I have described. """,1479427200,8,814,4.8768115942028984

1205397,5,B00000F9I1,"EXCELLENT! This is a very good adaptation of an exceptionnally brilliant novel. I liked this film a lot, even if it is absolutely heartbreaking for most of its duration. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

In post-Second World War London, a young woman, Jean Paget (Virginia McKenna), inherits a large sum of money. Asked by her sollicitor what she wants to do with it, Jean answers ""I want to go to a small village in Malaya and build a well"". Seeing the surprise of the lawyer, she starts telling him the story of her tribulations in Malaya during WWII - and with this the story begins...

This is the adaptation of a wonderful novel by Nevil Shute and it follows the book quite faithfully - although only the first half of it. The main character, Jean Paget, is a genuine power woman, in the best meaning of the term - nothing to do with feminazi hysteria... She will face all the ordeals the cruel war time will throw at her with amazing strength of mind (if not always body) and a dignity which forces respect. She will also meet, in most horrible circumstances, a certain Joe Harman (Peter Finch), a guy somehow simpler than her - but if possible even more courageous and as noble as one can imagine a man. Joe and Jean story in those horrible war time will be short and ultimately simple - but as intense as possible... I will say no more about it.

This film shows well the horrible suffering of white civilians who were seized by the Japanese during WWII - however, being made in 1956, it doesn't show the worse crimes... But it is still a horrible, horrible story, which will break your heart at every step the women and children shown here make - before offering just a tiny little bit of, well, something else, just towards the end.

The fact that this film doesn't cover the second part of the book makes it almost impossible to understand why the heck the title is ""A town like Alice"" - but on another hand, once you watched it, you can read the book and still be impressed by it, as it contains many a treasure not treated on the screen.

The one thing I missed a lot in this film is that Joe Harman never says ""Oh my word"" - something that in the book is his personal version of comas and dots in almost every sentence...)))

I liked this film a lot, I was impressed by the actors, it shocked and moved me and I will definitely watch it again - and therefore this DVD is a keeper. ENJOY!",1448409600,,2427,4.370288248337029
1205398,3,B00000F9I1,"I loved the book hence, the movie. The recording quality was weak. Also the film script has too many holes for people to put pieces together. Will try tv series next.",1447286400,,166,4.387096774193548

1205501,1,B00000F9I1,This film is a typically cheesy vintage film that actually cuts the story in half. Focusing on the events during WWII the film manages to turn the story into a predictable sob story. Shute's book is about a strong and determined woman who finds her strength and talents in the trauma of war and who then transforms the world around her by determination and resilience. This film makes her a typical girl who is oddly subsumed by the story and ends the story with a love scene in the airport. It captures the plot points of the first half of Shute's book and fails entirely to tell the story Shute intended to tell.,1392595200,5,614,4.442477876106195

The TV mini-series made in the '80s starring Helen Morse and Bryan Brown is much better - one of my all time favorites.  To be fair, it's hard to capture all of a big story in a 90 minute movie and a mini-series can go into the essential details.

1205573,4,B00000F9I1,"A Town Like Alice is the 1956 low-budget film adaptation of the 1950 novel of the same title by Nevil Shute. The screenplay generally follows the plot of the novel, although only the first half of the novel is included: Jeans experiences in Australia and her life with Joe are absent from the film. Joe is very well played by Peter Finch; Virginia McKenna plays a rather older Jean than in the book, blonde, unable to speak Malay and rather more emotional. The setting is quite authentic, although some of the beauty is lost due to the film not being in colour, and in trying to portray sunburned skin in b&w it is difficult not to make the actors look simply dirty or made up. This film won the 1957 BAFTA Best British Actor, Best British Actress and was nominated for the Best British Screenplay, Best British Film and Best Film from any source.

1205618,5,B00000F9I1,"Yes, in a # of ways the Australian mini-series is better; it's in color & it's
longer & contains some very interesting plot twists this one doesn't;
the 2nd part of the mini-series takes place mostly in Australia, a little in
the UK, while only the last l5-20 minutes of this b/w film does.

But it's very well done, maybe not quite as good all the way thru as the
mini-series.  But the conclusion, last 5 minutes or so, is even better.
Virginia McKenna does a great acting job, especially in the increasingly emotionally gripping scenes in the last few minutes.  I can't imagine how she
could have been better.

So both are worth seeing.  I've transferred the mini-series to 2 dvd's,
don't want to hold my breath till it's available on dvd commercially.
But this b/w film version is a truly fine movie, gets better & better the further into it you get.  Be prepared for at least one difficult to watch
scene (my wife cldn't watch it).  & then a truly wonderful conclusion,
esp Virginia McKenna's superb & memorable acting.  She sure knows how to
do romance.

1205619,5,B00000F9I1,"This original 1956 adaptation of the Nevil Shute book, ""A Town Like Alice,"" is a great teaser.  This version stared Peter Finch as Joe Harmon as an Australian POW and Virginia McKenn as Jean Paget, an English woman being marched around the coutnry side of the Malay penninsula by her Japanese captors.  The book, the 1956 movie and a 1981 Masterpiece Theater TV production are all based from an actual incident that took place in Malaya in the early months of 1942.  A number of English women and children were captured by the Japanese.  No officer would take responsibility for them at any internment camps so they were marched hundreds of miles around the countryside.  Many of the women as well as some children, died of disease, fatigue and starvation.  When their Japanese guard dies, Jean Paget brokers a deal with a village elder.  He allows the survivors to stay in his village to plant and harvest rice.  Joe Harmon pilfers and barters for food and medicine to keep them alive which he passes along to Jean Paget.  The two develop a relationship talking about their hometowns.  Jean is drawn to Joe's stories about Alice Springs.  At some point Joe is discovered to have been stealing by the Japanese.  He is beaten and cruicified for his troubles with his fellow POW's and the English women, including Jean Paget, looking on helplessly.  I won't go into any more on this story other than to say the women survive the war.  READ THE BOOK.  Then watch this movie.  Finch and McKenna BOTH won the 1956 BAFTA awards for Best Performance by an actor or actress.  This is the English version of the Academy Award Oscar. A DVD extra includes an interview with several of the performers, including Virginia McKenna and the director.  They provide some nice background information on the making of the film.
My three daugthers became familiar with the 1981 Masterpiece Theater version that starred Bryan Brown, Helen Morse and Gordon Jackson.  We fell in love with the story.  On our summer vacations driving cross country we would listen to the book on tape at least three times every summer as we drove all over the country.
The 1956 version is much shorter then the 1981 version but the story comes across nicely.  The rock solid performances of Peter Finch and Virginia McKenna are the icing on the cake.  If forced to choose between the 1956 and the 1981 story I would be hard pressed to make the call.
Hopefully, Masterpiece Theater will get their version out on DVD.  They are missing a golden opportunity.  The versions that are out there are poorly copied from VHS tape and leave a lot to be desired.
You won't go wrong buying this DVD.",1342310400,27,2646,4.6898047722342735

1205622,4,B00000F9I1,"Having read Neville Shute's book, and seen the three hour miniseries (and really enjoyed both), I really wanted to see this original film version starring Virginia McKenna and Peter Finch.  The screenplay is a trimmed down version of the story, eliminating the development of Jean's relationship with her barrister, and eliminating entirely her development in Australia.

Still, I thought the actors and director did a nice job with capturing the conditions of the forced marches, and although  tame by any modern standards, I did have a sense of the horror of Joe's capture and crucifixion for stealing a chicken (and hitting a Japanese soldier).

This short novel send-up was the real deal, starring many fine actors, both Japanes and British. Told in flashback to Harry Andrews, the romantic leads are Helen Morse and a new-comer, Bryan Brown. What is missing today in any Hollywood love story is the struggle, sacrifice and testingt of potential partners dramatized throughout this series. The tension of the unselfish pair, builds to s surprise climax, but you would lose considerable enjoyment if you miss any of the realistic events that tested their resilience and courage, both the captors and the captives, when war intervenes. Well-rounded characters throughout this landscape of despair, suffering and hopefulness. A shame to be shelved this long not on DVD.
