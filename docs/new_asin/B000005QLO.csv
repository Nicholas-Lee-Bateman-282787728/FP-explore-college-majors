1185125,5,B000005QLO,"Burton and Elfman have completely outdone themselves in a monument of a cinamatic masterpiece.  The first time I saw it, I wasn't old enough to appreciate it.  Now I'm tired of renting it and wanna order it!!  Surrealism, drama, true love,heartbreaking music, and flat out reality is  perfectly combined into a film that satisfies the strange person in all of  us.  Better yet, its actually a GOOD kind of strange.  It's the only movie  that can really make me cry, and I'd recommend it to anyone, any age.  Order the film and the soundtrack and you'll be the happiest person on the  face of this planet.  The film reminds us of the many different forms  inexcusable innocence can take and the ruthless ignorance of people  today....and more importantly, the power of true love.  The music brings  out the light in darkness...its all just plain good.  I'll leave you at  that.",932083200,,876,4.733333333333333
1185126,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton has outdone himself with this surreal fairy tale. The classical Price scenes filmed in b&w gave this movie serious weight and set it apart from other modern-day classic attempts to decommercialize Christmas.  The ice dance, for example, was enchanting and still gives me chills even  though I've seen this film several times. Depp was (as he always is)  perfect. The ending could have been less violent, but the rest of the film  more than makes up for it. 5 stars!!",930182400,,477,4.780487804878049

I personally thought this was one of Tim Burton weaker films, but the whimsy is quite high in it, so if that is your thing you should give it a go.  good for a relaxing evening remembering just how ridiculous the 1950's were, pull up your TV-trays and your iced-tea (shot of bourbon not necessary), it is classic movie night!",1517529600,,454,4.380952380952381

1185187,4,B000005QLO,"The early stages of this fairytale-ish spin on Frankensteins monster are classic Burton. Everything clicks. The clever set design. Diane Wiests irrepressible enthusiasm. (She is one of the most lovable characters Ive seen.) Depps sweet, scarred and scared monster who becomes her pet project  all baby steps and anxious eyes. And Alan Arkin delightfully matter-of-fact  the perfect tone for this placid, synchronous environment. Why Edward Scissorhands? Why not?

But while the charm endures for a time, the clever ideas begin to run short in a necessarily more worldly second act. In particular, Edwards supposed fascination with Winona Ryders Kim is critically underdone. The backstory segments seem thin, as though they were an afterthought. And Burton over the later stretches seems more interested in expedience than art  getting this now-ungainly creation to its icy end.

The which, sad to say, lacks the intended joyful feel. Rather, its a manipulative effect at the end of a half-great film that hasn't quite earned it.",1517011200,,1028,5.3602484472049685

1185234,5,B000005QLO,"A true cinematic masterpiece. This story combines a beautiful, bizarre imagery with that of the stereotyped, monochromatic suburbia to positively astounding effect. Telling the potent and heart-warming tale of a man with scissors for hands and his complex relationship with the social restrictions of American suburbia, this film tells a modern (or rather semi-modern) beauty-and-the-beast tale with incredible cinematic flair. The score and cinematography combine to create a narrative that is as fantastic as it is relatable; as imaginative and wonderful as it is grounded in the familiarity of modern life. Essentially, this is one of the true pinnacles of American cinema and a truly beautiful film that explores difference with a level of emotionality and realism that truly resonates with anyone who knows what its like to deviate from the ""normal"". I truly cannot say enough good things about this movie.",1512172800,,911,5.422535211267606

Officer Allen: Will he be OK, Doc?
Psychologist: The years spent in isolation have not equipped him with the tools necessary to judge right from wrong. He's had no context. He's been completely without guidance. Furthermore, his work - the garden sculptures, hairstyles and so forth - indicate that he's a highly imaginative... uh... character. It seems clear that his awareness of what we call reality is radically underdeveloped.
Officer Allen: But will he be *all right* out there?

1185252,5,B000005QLO,"Personally, this is my favorite Burton film. Edward (played by Johnny Depp) is a machine endowed with humanity and heart by Vincent (played by Vincent Price), the late inventor. He is kept isolated for many years while suburbia has built up around the foot of the hill on which his mansion stands until one day when a sweet Avon lady named Peg Boggs takes him in. At the Boggs' house, Edward quickly falls in love with Kim (played by Winona Ryder) and soon desires to fit in with the tacky, pastel suburbia of the 1950's. He tries his hands at sculpting bushes into outrageous shapes like clowns and dinosaurs, which makes the neighbors happy and is a nod to childlike innocence that is paramount in several of Tim Burton's films. He also finds work as a dog stylist and a hair stylist and even a television sensation before being cornered sexually and then being accused of rape. That's when things begin to go south for Edward. The film is a classic modern day fairytale about a doomed romance that cannot be because the two people come from two completely different worlds. It is also the story of a social outcast who just wants to be accepted and to fit in. Tim Burton has admitted that ""Edward Scissorhands"" may be his sole autobiographical film.

Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Denise Dinovi and Danny Elfman are one of the ultimate Hollywood powerhouses of the 80's and 90's, known for their ability to take the dark and the weird and package it into a form that is still raw, but is more desirable to the public.",1508716800,,1515,4.569852941176471

1185308,3,B000005QLO,"20th century fox has reissued the old Tim Burton classic EDWARD SCISSORHANDS on blu-ray again
this time as 25th Anniversary edition, so what's different this time around
well only a new HD transfer is what's different, the new HD transfer has had colour restoration plus no Grain no Dirt in the quality
so the picture quality does look incredible the best it's ever looked much better then the previous blu-ray version
the sound quality is the same 5.1 master mix
but tragically no new extras no new retrospective featurette which is what should've been added for 25th anniversary blu-ray
unfortunately 20th century fox didn't bother getting new interviews with some of the cast & crew
all they did was recycle the old extras from the very old dvd version
which is the usual promo Vintage featurete, plus the 2 audio commentaries & the original Trailer
pretty pathetic effort by century fox that's for sure
the only highlight of this new reissue is the new HD transfer which does look amazing quality
only worth under $10 , if there was new extras added then i would give more stars, so 2-3 stars i give it",1503705600,,1106,4.706185567010309

I believe that the producers of this film set out to make something beautiful, and they did just that.

Tim Burton's visionary storytelling, Johnny Depp's perfectly played lead character and Danny Elfman's music just work in such a perfect balance. The idea of a huge Gothic castle right smack-dab in the middle of the pastel suburbia is just so surreal, then when Edward invades the suburban world (by means of a well-meaning Avon woman) the film becomes a fascinating character study. There are quite a few unresolved questions if you really read into the film (is Edward a machine? Does he eat? Does he have normal bathroom functions?) but if you look beyond that and just enjoy the artistry and brilliance of this film, it's really a remarkable work of art.",1494547200,,793,5.015151515151516

At first, people were all interested in him because his special abilities, and he fell in love with Kim, who,unluckily, didn't loved him. Then, after some misunderstanding, people of the whole town insisted to let Edward leave here. Finally, Edward lived alone again in the castle, although Kim accepted his pure love.
Sometimes, beauty and ugliness cannot be told apart as easy as it was seen. We may believe our eyes too much but ignore the more precious virtues. We could even hurt those who really loved us so easily just because they loved us asking no return. And when we find what we have done were wrong, we could do nothing to retrieve it and only live with sorrow.
Thus, we need to find who really cares for us by our heart but not our eyes. Carefully find them, treasure them and love them. Don't believe it could all be made good. More time, if we miss some good things we will miss it forever, although we begin to know it and treasure it. It is just too late.
In the town which had never snowed it began to snow after Edward's appearance. Did it represent the pure Edward and his sad love?",1484870400,,1279,4.355648535564853

***Spoiler Alert***

The movie starts off with an old woman telling her granddaughter a bedtime story, as the snow falls outside. She tells her the story of Edward, who had scissors instead of hands.

Johnny Depp stars as Edward, a man created by a scientist but remains incomplete due to the untimely death of the scientist. He was to be given hands but the scientist suffers from a fatal heart attack and dies. Edward is left to fend for himself. He lives in a spooky Mansion.

An Avon sales rep, Peg (from a little awkward community), finds Edward. At first, she is afraid of him but then she realises that he is a kindred person and takes him down to her house. Her neighbours (nosy women) are curious about the new comer and they pester Peg to introduce them. They even invite themselves over for a barbecue. Edward becomes the centre of attention and he actually likes it.

Edward trims the neighbourhood's hedges and creates beautiful life-like figures out of them (dinosaurs, dolphins, ballerinas, etc). All the women are impressed and they also bring their dogs for new hairstyles. One woman asks that he cuts her hair as well - all the ladies end up getting haircuts from him (I was not impressed by their haircuts - I think they looked like runaways from the Asylum)...

Peg's daughter, Kim returns from her mini vacay and she finds Edward in her waterbed - she gets a fright. Peg's husband gives Edward some alcohol and he faints. Edward falls in love with Kim but her boyfriend Jim, takes advantage of Edward's abilities and this lands Edward in jail.

You have to watch the movie to find out the rest...Overall, it's a dark romance which kept me captivated :)",1477180800,,1739,4.644951140065147

Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Danny Elfman, Dianne West, Anthony Michael Hall.........what more could one ask for.  Even though this film is clearly based on Frankenstein, the story is so outlandish that it stands on its own.... I don't think that Burton ever topped this work, but most of his work is so good that I might say the same about his other movies if the chronologic order was different. I rewatch this movie every 5 years or so and every time I do it brings back the melancholy I felt the first time I watched it.....

1185790,5,B000005QLO,"This was the film that, for me, marked Tim Burtons leap from very talented young director, to one of the best most unique film voices of our time, along with Johnny Depps leap from very talented young actor to one of our best actors, period.  What Depp and Burton seem to share is an understanding of the visual power of film, but not just with cinematography and effects, but in performance.  Depp is almost like a great silent film star, communicating more with his eyes, than most actors could with a monologue.

This is the surreal fable of a young man who was built, not born, and whose creator dies before he can finish him, leaving him alone, with scissors for hands.  Hes found and adopted by a sweet, if slightly daffy Avon lady  Diane Weist in another of an endless series of brilliant supporting performances.  She takes young orphan Edward down from the near black and white castle in which the lives to the bright pastel world of the suburban town below.  (A world almost as surreal in its exaggerated way as his lonely castle.

There the outcast finds a place, and maybe even love, but is there really room for the truly different in our society?  A film in which everything is bigger than life, but infused with heart and the bitter-sweetness of life itself.  It brings a smile to my face, and tears to my eyes on every viewing.",1462752000,7,1343,4.512396694214876

1185821,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands had a profound emotional impact on me. I think because I was able to identify with the main character of Edward, a half human half Frankenstein robot with hedge clippers for hands.  While I don't have quite so drastic a story, I was born with cerebral palsy and use a wheelchair on a daily basis. This and my own sheltered nature has made it pretty challenging to make friends over the years. Because of all this, I really felt something of a kinship with Edward.

In the span of approx. two hours, Edward goes from mysterious to the talk of the town to some type of dangerous half human. He is betrayed by people he trusts and is used for his unique skills. I have sometimes felt this way myself, so I can relate. I definitely understand being shy and sensitive like Edward grasping for understanding from a world that cant seem to understand. Hopefully I won't be driven into my own version of a house on a hill. A deeply meaningful movie.",1461110400,,961,4.485714285714286

It's a great cult film, featuring the last appearance of Vincent Price which takes place in the small subdivision in Lutz Florida.

With the 25th anniversary you would hope they would have added some more features. They did not, at all. Nothing new.
I'm currently eyeing my dvd (10th anniversary),
-Audio commentary with Tim Burton and Danny Elfman (eh, i love them both but not really worth it)
-featurette
-Theatrical trailers
The only difference is this set comes with an air freshener, cookie cutter and paper chain. thing.
The air freshener is typical, it does smell up the entire set, so if you hate the smell i recommend airing out the box and washing and re-washing the cookie cutter.
The Cookie cutter, sigh, i was hoping it to look more like the hearts in the movie but alas, it's pretty generic, i'll use it and post pictures of the cookies later, once i get the smell out of it.",1446940800,8,894,4.59375

1186123,4,B000005QLO,"As the original TV series 21 Jump Street was winding down, Johnny Depp made the leap to a starring role on the big screen in Tim Burtons fantasy-fable Edward Scissorhands (1990).

Edward wasn't the first Goth, but hes certainly the most memorable. Before his makeover hes dressed entirely in black leather with studs and rings all over. With his hair spiked and face looking pale as EdwardScissorhandsscreen1death, he could easily have passed for one of those post-punkers that sprung up as a counterculture movement in the early 1980s in London and Dublinexcept that his hands were literally clumps of scissors. We learn in flashback that he lived in this Gothic castle with his creator (Vincent Price), an inventor who died before he could fit his beloved creature with a pair of hands.

Edward Scissorhands is a clever variation on the Mary Shelley novel. It embraces the basic structure and themes of Frankenstein, but also skewers suburbia for good measure. As Burton described it, its as if a more sensitive and communicative Frankensteins monster just happened to live in Martha Stewarts neighborhood.

Depp fans will revel in his nave, porcelain-doll performance as the sensitive and soft-spoken young man whos discovered alone and confused in the castle by Avon lady Peg (Dianne Wiest, in one of her most memorable roles). This peaches-and-cream woman, whos as cheerfully nave as young Edward, decides to to bring him home and, since her teenage daughter is away for the weekend, lets him sleep in her room on her waterbed. Its a gag you can see coming a mile away, and there are other similarly simplistic points-of-humor in this film. But Depp pulls it off with all the sly persuasiveness of a mime. Hes Charlie Chaplin with a lead-foot lurch . . . until, that is, he gets those scissors going. At the Gothic castle on the hill, hed decorated the garden by maintaining topiaries of his own design. Here, what better way to thank his hosts than by turning one of their dull bushes into a T-Rex, and the other into a living, green tableau of the family?

Edward Scissorhands is a story about being different in a world of sameness. Edward is a non-conformist of the most outrageous sort whos brought into the stronghold of conformity: American suburbia, where the houses all look alike (except for being painted in different pastel or Candyland colors). The men all drive off to work and return at exactly the same time, barbecues are social rituals, and everyone manicures and waters their identical-looking lawns as they lead nearly identical lives.

But since one of the women in this suburban cul-de-sac is as freaky religious as Carries mother, viewers are also invited to consider Edward Scissorhands from the perspective of religious intolerance and excess. An imperfect creature ends up trying to find a place in the world and is persecuted because of his imperfection. Edward as Christ figure? Its not all that far-fetched, since he does redeem these people from their dull-with-a-capital-D routines.

The point is, Edward Scissorhands is a deceptively simple but complex film that resonates as a fairy tale for adults precisely because it does work on so many different levels. Remove any one of the elements (like the surreal contrast between the candy-colored houses and the gloom-and-doom Gothic castle just down the street) and it fails. Its as fragile a construction as the films namesake.

Alan Arkins deadpan nonchalance serves this film well. As Pegs husband, hes the perfect Oh response to the new family member, and his reaction to Edwards struggle to eat a simple meal is as priceless as Depps performance. Then theres Kim (Winona Ryder), the daughter whos dating a cool guy at school while this outcast who obviously has a crush on her has to live out his unrequited love under the same roof. Its a bizarre Romeo and Juliet tale of ill-fated love as well, with Edward having to deal with Kims bullying boyfriend, Jim (Anthony Michael Hall). Some of the minor performances feel minor, but there are enough strong reactions to Depps portrayal to make for a solid film. One standout is Kathy Bakers performance as the clichd oversexed housewife who looks, walks, and acts like TVs Peg Bundy.

This 25th Anniversary edition doesnt contain any new features but it does offer a sparkling new transfer that delivers a more consistent picture. The previous Blu-ray release had scenes with excess grain that stood out and disrupted the surface. Will younger family members like it? That depends. It is a film thats both funny and sad, and very strange. Were talking about Tim Burton, after all. So it will really depend on how young viewers respond to strangeness and Depps fragile-but-deadly portrayal of Edward. Even younger teens may find the movie disturbing, given the way Edward is treated at the end. It may be too much to bear unless they're warned that it is a contemporary updating of the Frankenstein story.",1445126400,3,4940,4.950542822677925

1186130,5,B000005QLO,"Thats probably the first really great and creative film by Tim Burton. He used a very young Johnny Depp who is marvelous and surprising in composure, retained and controlled emotions just as if he had none and was feeling nothing. It is true that the fact he has no hands makes his body language a little bit deficient. But his face has to be emotionless too and only his eyes express some human feeling. His nature is not exactly sure, certified and guaranteed. Is he an artificial man like the creature of Frankenstein? Vincent Price was a specialist of that kind of horror movies with The hilarious House of Frankenstein, but also and above all the films adapted from Edgar Allen Poe and other authors in that line of human horror. So as a mad scientist he fits the role.

But Tim Burton was following a line that was common in many stories of haunted old castles and mansions and that Stephen King at that time was making famous in literature: not the mad scientist but the haunted house at the top of a hill surrounded by some suburban neighborhood. The mad scientist is just one more Dr Frankenstein building, fabricating, constructing a human creature though he does not have time to finish him: he has no hands and has scissors and blades of all sorts instead. But thats not the real subject of the story. The real subject is the contact of this man and the human society in which he is nearly by accident introduced. Surprisingly enough he can cope, at least not too badly, and he finds some simple middle way, meeting area where he can be of service and thus be accepted.

At this moment there is a bitter and sharp criticism of suburban America that can only accept a difference if it is interesting, meaning without any danger or risk, and if it can be useful for their own needs and interests, mainly financial. The point is that this suburban community is reduced to the wives of the community with a couple of children, a couple of teenagers and a couple of men. Sexist? Maybe? Realistic? Probably. These women bring up all kinds of interests of their own. Some are only interested in his carving hands to beautify their dogs, to sculpt their bushes and hedges, to cut their hair. For a plateful of cookies and nothing else. Thats the middle class in all its beautified selfishness. Some others are only attracted by the physical change such a man can bring up in their love life which is without any love but only hormonal secretions. Some high school teenagers are only attracted by his great way at opening all kinds of locks in order for him to be the key to the house they want to burglarize.

Two women are different. Mrs. Avon Calling is just trying to make him feel normal, happy, rested and satisfied with some human warmth. She will finally realize at the end that she did not think of what his own reactions could be when he started being rejected because she forgot to think that the others will be hostile after a while, after their curiosity was satisfied and they found out they could not use him for everything they wanted and for ever. And thats all. No escape from the haunted castle at the top of the hill. Go back there and survive like a ghost, and don't forget to die sooner or later. Only two people show some empathy. The cop chasing him and shooting in the air to make people believe he is dead, but they dont; and the poor Mrs. Avon Callings daughter who fell in love with him, or rather with his eyes but could not cope with the conflict her asking him to do something wrong for the sake of her supposed boyfriend was going to bring up in the form of a hostile reaction, practically some lynching of old.

Thats where Tim Burton is great and at the same time unnerving. He always looks for the darker side of things in any situation and there is no escape at all: you have to drink your sour potion right to the last drop. Your sour potion? Youre kidding. His sour bitter and rough potion that is in no way magic but a real curse on humanity. Tim Burton is a morbid entertainer who wants to make us lose all confidence in any future development or improvement of humanity because deep deeper and deepest man and woman are evil, evil like hell and evil like burning blazes in your backyard. It is great, it is good, it is dissuasive if you want to make friends with the weirdo newcomer in your suburban village. You better run first and thank God you escaped.

1186154,3,B000005QLO,"An early Johnny Depp film that parodies 1950s middle-class America with ticky-tack houses, pastel colors, overly coiffed housewives and above-all, intolerance of difference.  Edward Scissorhands (Depp) is a handcrafted humanoid -- a work in  in progress -- whose creator (Vincent Price) dies before he could substitute Edward's shears with human-like hands.  It's kind of like ""Frankenstein"" meets ""To Kill a Mockingbird.""  As long as Edward is useful to the neighbors (cutting lawns, trimming shrubs and doing the ladies' hair), he is accepted, but once Joyce, the local sexpot  (played by Kathy Baker) makes advances on Edward, he is transformed from a useful curiousity to an accused rapist.  Depp's performance as Scissorhands -- heavily influenced by mime -- is very touching.  But Peg Boggs (played by Diane Wiest). is a character who is essentially unmotivated except perhaps for a naive pity for a lonely boy. I wonder whether the moral point of the story is lost on the audience, especially since Edward's ""otherness"" is artificial, not natural.",1443312000,,1054,5.313253012048193

1186288,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands is a romantic fantasy that shows the story of an artificial man named Edward, an unfinished creation, who has scissors for hands. Edward is taken in by a suburban family and falls in love with their teenage daughter Kim. It stars Johnny Depp,who plays the title role. The supporting roles are portrayed by Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Anthony Michael Hall, Kathy Baker, Vincent Price, and Alan Arkin. The screenplay was written by Caroline Thompson and it was directed by Tim Burton.

An eccentric inventor lovingly assembles a synthetic youth named Edward,who has all the essential ingredients for today's standard body, with the exception of a pair of hands. For what is initially thought to be a temporary period, he is fitted with long, scissor-like extremities that, while able to trim a mean hedge, are hardly conducive to day-to- day life. When the kindly inventor dies, however, Edward is left lonely and cursed with some very heavy metal for hands. He is eventually taken in by Peg Boggs, an Avon lady who takes pity on him after seeing his bleak existence. Edward, in spite of his inherent ability to slay anyone he comes across, is a gentle soul whose only wish is to be loved. His impromptu family has, at best, a limited understanding of Edward, but he finds himself drawn to Peg's weary but sympathetic daughter, Kim, who is dating Jim, the neighborhood bully. Meanwhile, Edward finds himself a local celebrity after the town realizes that his talents include creative hedge trimming and an unrivaled ability to cut hair. His so- called friends are proved fair-weather when Edward is accused of a crime, after which his only supporters are Peg and Kim.

This film is a magical modern fairy tale with Gothic overtones and a sweet center. Also,it blends comedy, fantasy, and romance to make a sentimental fairy tale that both teens and adults will enjoy. It's visually pleasing and an easy film to like, even if it never gets out of shallow water as far as its story goes.",1433721600,,2003,4.853801169590644

Johnny Depp plays the role of Edward magnificently- a shy but likable 'invention' of a being. For at least the first half of the movie, it comes across as the perfect family movie depicting a close-knit community that has people of humor and charm, with everything on the lighthearted side. Then things change for the second half of the movie, as things intensify, the plot thickens a tad, and violence ensues. Still, I would consider this a family movie, though it has a PG-13 rating. I will say that it's a quite different experience watching a Tim Burton movie that highlights suburbia (and in the bright daytime, I might add). Edward Scissorhands is a balanced movie that is easy to follow, and isn't over the top in its presentation. I recommend this movie.",1431388800,,871,4.699346405228758

My favorite part, I think, is when Edward is on a cable-access TV show.  He is asked if there is someone special in his life -- he looks directly at the camera but says nothing.  Kim (Winona Ryder), in her living room, watching the show with her boyfriend, flinches, and looks nervously away  Their connection is electric.",1428105600,2,505,4.758620689655173

Edward Scissorhands (Johnny Depp) is a Frankenstein like creation of a doctor who died before he could put on his hands (We don't know why he had all these blades for hands).  A local Avon saleslady discovers him in this old mansion on a hill and takes him home.  He is first accepted and then rejected by the locals.  The scenery, characters and storyline is totally strange as in most works by Tim Burton.  Burton likes to present weird things and never explain them, your expected to accept them as is.  Normally I do not care for Burton's works, but for some reason this one does work.  It is a different, but entertaining film.  Worth a watch.",1420848000,,722,4.5

But this movie succeeds so admirably. Johnny Depp is very good in the part of Edward Justin of tenderness and vulnerability to touch one's heart, but he escapes the trap of being cloying. If you haven't seen it, you really should. And if you have the Blu-ray makes it worth seeing again. I highly recommend this movie",1419292800,3,480,4.726190476190476

1186591,5,B000005QLO,"This is an unforgettable film! It was created in a grotesque style. This film begins with a close cooperation Johnny Depp and Tim Burton. And this creative debut turned out bright and prominent in artistic terms. This film is notable for the emergence of another famous horror master of Vincent Price. Unfortunately, this was the last role of Vincent. But here in the role of an eccentric inventor, he left a lasting impression. I also want to note the excellent play of Depp in the role of Edward. He got the image of an innocent, I would even say soul genius which have seen only good. But unfortunately, society the impulse of the soul is not appreciated. Moreover, the same society that the original used it for selfish purposes, morally it destroyed. And Edward was forced to go back to the castle to live alone the rest of life.",1418860800,,834,4.604026845637584

And why drag in various projects by the same director when reviewing a particular film. I suppose when you want to crucify something you pull out all the stops.
What Ebert does not angle on is that ES is a social comedy of horrors that should not be judged like a real life social drama that requires major character development to sustain it's goofiness standard much like many of Burton's films. They virtually exist to explore that goofiness to the hilt with no promise of payoff. Edward starts the way it ends, nothing is majorly transformed or revitalized as most stories stay to a transforming formula. What we have is when goofy characters collide and we part when the deed is done. The music is an added plus which states the magic behind the Edward story.",1410652800,,986,4.45303867403315

1186833,5,B000005QLO,"Oh my, what happened to you?
Edward Scissorhands, the story of an uncommonly gentleman, was directed by Tim Burton and starred Johnny Depp. The The very first Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration remains one of their best.
The film came out in 1990 and certainly has the feel of an 80s classic.
The imagination and wonder fires on all cylinders.
The themes of self discovery and isolation all hit home on many levels.
Burton really swung for the fences with the gothic by way of suburban style. He pretty much nailed it.
Essentially what you get, is something you've never really seen before.
The story itself it very far out. Johnny Depp plays the lead as Edward Scissorhands.
He is a Frankenstein like creature with scissors for hands. His inventor is unable to complete the project, so Edward must keep his scissor hands. The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role.  As it turns out, this strange turn of events lead Edward down a very interesting path.
It's exciting, funny, scary, strange, and thoughtful.
The film is a fascinating and very creative meditation on the value of unique talents and communication.
It's legend that Depp only actually speaks 169 words throughout the entire film.
The story is essentially told through his eyes, facial expressions and awkward body movements.
A high mark for the Burton-Depp collaboration cannon and certainly worth revisiting.

1186839,1,B000005QLO,"I remembered enjoying this film as a child so I decided to watch it again with my children, not remembering much of the details of the movie from so long ago.  Wrong decision!  The language, sexual scene, and dark undertones are inappropriate for children to watch and, frankly, I didn't find enjoyment or uplift from the movie myself.",1403222400,,335,4.758620689655173

1186861,5,B000005QLO,"It's a joy when the ending credits start to roll and the only thought that comes to mind is ""this is the movie I've been waiting for my entire life!"" Maybe 'a joy' is underselling its importance. Edward Scissorhands is one of the most beautiful masterpieces these eyes have ever seen. In every imaginable facet, Edward Scissorhands is perfect. It is also a movie that can be interpreted in so many ways. Is Edward a symbol for all outcasts who have their own 'scissorhands' that keep them from getting too close to anyone? Could he be a symbol for celebrities that are alternately praised and condemned by the masses? He could be all of these things and more. Whatever the viewer may choose him to be, he will always remain relatable to anyone who has ever once felt like an outsider. His appeal is practically universal in that sense, although Burton certainly doesn't sacrifice an ounce of his vision to make his film appeal to everyone. It is still a very dark and bleak story behind the humor. Edward was created in a spooky mansion on a hill, but the truly creepy setting is the suburb of perfect little dollhouses that's isolated from the outside world. Burton's view of suburbia is that of caricaturist. The husbands all leave work at the same time, the wives do nothing but gossip and flirt, the houses, save for the paint jobs, are identical, the lawns are a lush green, nothing seems quite real, and there is no trace of any form of civilization beyond the suburbs. In the film's shocking showdown, he shows the outcome of two world's colliding: one of a gentle, misunderstood nature, and one of a greedy, self-important nature, and what a hell of an ending. Apart from the humor and the dark elements, there is a touching and doomed romance between Edward and Kim that balances out the film and makes it work on every level: as a dark comedy, a tragic romance, and a grim fantasy. Edward Scissorhands was shot with the typical Burton energy and precision, a camera that's not afraid to move but also quiet and observant when it's still. Two particular sequences that are visually memorable are Edward's B&E and his ice sculpture scene when Kim dances under the ice flakes. In those, Burton proves to be a director that fully understands what kind of shots elicit certain emotions and uses that knowledge to his full advantage. The score by Danny Elfman plays on the whimsical fantasy elements of the story in a very effective manner. It is clear he spent much time composing specific pieces to highlight a variety of emotional undertones throughout. Johnny Depp as the title character is spectacular. No other actor, with the possible exception of Robert Downey Jr., could play Edward Scissorhands with the finesse Depp displayed. He allegedly schooled himself from watching Charlie Chaplin's films to learn how to emote purely through facial expressions and body language. His schooling paid off big time. Winona Ryder as Kim, the gorgeous love interest, is spot-on as always. Dianne Wiest is hilarious as a door-to-door makeup saleslady and Alan Arkin is just as funny as her husband who never seems to fully grasp Edward's disposition. Kathy Baker is a lovelorn, middle-aged housewife who is essentially a less despicable Mrs. Robinson. Anthony Michael Hall, oddly enough, plays the tough, possessive boyfriend of Kim, a casting choice that surprisingly worked. And finally, there's Vincent Price as The Inventor, in his very last role. The entire cast is truly brilliant and do a magnificent job of taking Burton's zany ideas and turning them into reality. Edward Scissorhands, to reiterate, is a masterwork. Bravo to everyone involved in the production for helping make this cinematic miracle.",1402358400,,3709,4.888888888888889

And young Winnona Ryder is the perfect, sensitive every-girl who wins Edwards heart. With only very mild sexual innuendo - and mild, mild violence and peril - it is a film the whole family can enjoy.

1187046,5,B000005QLO,"Time and time again this movie is just pure joy. Its like comfort food to me. Tim Burton out did himself with this cult film. It is Tim Burtoned out through and through ( 1950's middle America, post nuclear family) When I think of Butron I immediately think Edward! What a classic film! This film touches your heart and soul in a sweet way; a monster whos creator dies in front of him before he gets the chance to put on his real human like hands, has a sudden heart attack leaving poor Edward alone to fend for himself, that is until a sweet middle aged woman comes knocking at his castle door selling Avon products. So 80's! Johnny Depp did a phenomenal job playing the part of Edward Scissorhands. His creator/inventor was played by Vincent Price.( Fun Fact: This was the great Vincent Prices' last film before he passed :/). The story takes you on a journey through suburbia and this sweet little lady who rescues Edward from the ruins of the castle and tries to bring him into society. At first Edward has a hard time adjusting, especially since he has scissors as hands but he soon adjusts to using them and does great things with his ""hands"". He builds masterpieces out of bushes and trees and decorates the entire neighborhood he lives in. He also starts cutting peoples hair and also the pets of the small town. Danny Elfman does the music for this film as he usually does for  almost all Tim Burton films and it is so perfect and fitting. Those two were meant to create together!  All in all this movie is just fantastic! Reminds me of my youth watching it over and over again! A bit of a nastaliac feeling everytime I watch it!",1386460800,,1638,4.438538205980066

1187048,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands is described as a comedy/drama, but I think an element of fantasy needs to be thrown in there as well due to the adventurous presentation, unbelievable storyline and the dramatic high quality of the music (comparable to a Harry Potter soundtrack, and incredibly sad at the very end).  It's about Johnny Depp being born, er, created, with scissors for hands!  This means not only can he not function normally with actual hands, he's learned to depend on his scissors to do everything for him.  This makes it troublesome for young Edward to do the things that you and I would do, such as turn a doorknob, pick up a glass of water, dress himself, or cuddle the girl of his dreams.

Speaking of which, the actual story!  Dianne Wiest plays the role of a salesperson who goes around a deceivingly friendly neighborhood with pink, yellow and green homes everywhere, giving the entire neighborhood a fake Mr. Rogers look like everyone's living in a happy little suburbian neighborhood.  However the people that live in these homes are a bunch of middle aged women who like to spread gossip, indulge in curiosities and well, in one case, the red-headed lady is desperately lonely for a man.  One woman believes Edward Scissorhands is the devil!  Dianne however, is so desperate for someone to purchase whatever it is she's trying to sell, she actually enters the old creepy mansion on the hill where Edward Scissorhands lives.  Once she arrives and notices a teenage boy with scissors for hands hiding in the corner of an upstairs room, she asks him to come home with her family.  This is how such a crazy tale all begins!

It turns out that Edward, despite all the difficulties he has functioning in an environment with regular people due to a lack of having hands, has a few talents that aren't apparent right away.  He can trim practically anything into a masterpiece, including bushes, dogs and women's hair.  He's also very shy and introverted, but despite this, he loves Dianne's daughter but can never find the right words to impress her.  This leads to my favorite scene in the movie- when Dianne's daughter comes home late one night, and nobody actually tells her that a teenage boy with scissors for hands is now living with the family, so she walks into her bedroom to see Edward Scissorhands lying in bed!  All the excitement and chaos results in poor Edward accidentally stabbing a hole in the girls water bed, which is funny in itself since nobody in the family was quick to care about the possibility of water on the second floor potentially absorbing through the floorboards and causing a ceiling disaster.

This is all make believe of course, but I do think there's a couple moments where the writing unintentionally offends people who don't have hands.  Someone who loses their hands and has to relearn how to use them by prosthetic means might find such material highly offensive, but I know it's not the writers fault and it's not meant to be taken that way.  Sometimes though, it comes across that way, hence the unintentional nature of it.

Of course we have to have one guy who's a great big jerk.  The jerk in this case is Dianne's daughter's boyfriend who thinks Edward Scissorhands is a freak so he wants him out of his and his girlfriend's life.  Such is the case when it concerns teenagers.  However this eventually spills into an unforgettable disaster.

The ending is pretty unpredictable.  I wasn't sure how such a bizarre story would finish but what we see is fitting I suppose- just not what I was expecting.  Overall, highly recommended for all movie fans, but it's not quite a children's movie due to some sexual implications and lots of blood due to Edward constantly accidentally people.",1386288000,,3736,4.763975155279503

1187146,5,B000005QLO,Edward Scissorhands is by far one of the single most best movies Mr. Tim Burton has ever made during his whole movie directing life.  I feel that the movie at it's core is not just a Drama movie but also a tragic love story within the movie because of the feelings Edward has for the girl he meets in the parents house.  Johnny Deep did an amazing job as always with the character he played in the movie and Winona Ryder also mind blowing preformance made it one of my favorite movies of all time in my collection.  I can only say that about a few of them in my collection so thats saying lot.  But also fair warning (spolier) it also shows how fast people can turn on you just for being different as did the town in the movie.  And also love the music of Danny Elfman uses for the movie such a great talent the man has for all of Tim Burton's movies.  So if you love your Tim Burton movies and enjoy Deep's earlier film works then buy this movie if you don't already have it in your collection and I feel it will become one of your favorite movies in your collection just like it did for me.,1373932800,,1092,4.103286384976526

If he doesn't, it wouldn't matter because this film was so great that Tim Burton would get a pass for any crap that he churns out afterward.

1187212,5,B000005QLO,"I always felt that Burton and Depp when making a movie usually succeeded best when it was an original Burton concept rather then a take on someone elses brainchild except for Sleepy Hollow, which I feel did right by Washington Irving's story, as opposed to Alice and Willie and Barnabas.
  Edward-Scissor hands is about a Professor, sadly the great Vincent Prices in his last screen appearance in which he dies as well ironically enough. He looks at the cooking making machines he has created which is like most modern machine does all the work from scratch to finished product. He imagines creating something out of those parts and that creation is Edward Scissorhands. He teaches him like a fatherly tutor about how to be a Gentleman. But before he can attach the new hands he has for Edwards Birthday, he is stricken and dies, the hands he was holding impale on Edwards clippers and break to pieces.
 This is a little Pinocchio in this tale except that instead of becoming a real boy the protagonist wishes only to have normal hands so he embrace his love Winona Ryder. Having these Shears seem like a talisman for Ed, he cant ignore the beautiful things he can create with them, he cant help himself, he has to create art from whacky though unique Haircuts to Artistic hedges and funnily groomed dogs. Basically see I Edward as the archtype of the possessed  artist who will never be free to live life until he can a balance between his art and the real world.
 No matter how Edward tries he cant leave something be without turning it into a work of art. Its a cursed talent Edward has. He appears to be immortal and yet you know in the end how lonely he must be though the last shot of him is his admiring his work in the Prof Gardend. Perhaps there is a tear rolling down his eye that we cant see.
  We see this in many Artists of the past and present who wrecked their lives and careers in their constant pursuit of their next piece of work and lost that which should have mattered more to them. Edwards story tell us that you cant have just one and expect the other to maintain. Without the shears he still would have had the talent, it just meant he would have been slower. But would have had his true love and he could have created a happy medium between the two.
  Its a very sad tale. It had me blubbering to tears. Something no movie had done in a long time.  A great fairy tale, probably will always be Burton's greatest creation and Depp's most sympathetic role.",1366934400,,2477,4.436123348017621

Acting is first rate and the scenics and costumes are hilarious spoofs on the pastel excesses of the fifties. Not to be taken too seriously on a literal level it is nonetheless something of a morality play. I found the film to be entertaining and at times raucously funny.
The story line is pure fantasy as the story of a young man who was created by a mad scientist who gave him multiple sets of scissors in place of hands. He was about to be fitted with real ones just before his creator died and left him to fend for himself in a dilapidated castle on a promontory overlooking a small town filled with eccentric characters.

I've been hooked to Tim Burton and Danny Elfman ever since I was a little girl with Beetlejuice, but Edward Scissorhands is simply Tim Burton's signature piece. Not only is Johnny Depp's work flawless under Tim's direction, but Danny creates this atmosphere that drives you into the movie possessing you and not letting you go.

Definitely worth watching. The Blue Ray disk does not have as many extras as one would expect, but the crisp image not delivered in the olden VHS cassettes or even on the newer DVD versions provides is well worth the 5+ stars.",1360454400,2,705,4.8264462809917354

1187257,5,B000005QLO,"A misshapen boy with scissors for hands is discovered by the Avon lady high above the city in his creator's dark castle. Peg decides to bring him home and clean him up, hoping to help Edward adjust to ""normal"" society, but their friends and neighbors have more interest in changing Edward than accepting him for being different. EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is undoubtedly Tim Burton's personal masterpiece; A tragic, heartfelt character drama that is more telling about the director, himself, than any of his other films. The themes of isolation, acceptance, and normality run deep, forming an outright cry against proper society. Edward finds himself supplanted in a world consumed by status and appearances. The ideals of 1950's society are turned upside down to reveal their true superficiality. Edward is nothing but a passing fad to these people, just another thing to own. No one accepts him for being different, they simply try to mold and shape him in their own image. The humor in the film reflects this in its distrustful cynicism and satire. Johnny Depp teams with Tim Burton for the first time as Edward, bringing about the innocence of boyhood in a subtle yet highly-effective performance. Danny Elfman's magnificent score drives the emotional highs and lows as well, while Bo Welch does a brilliant job contrasting the cookie-cutter world of 50's consumer culture with Tim Burton's twisted imaginings as production designer. Cult status aside, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS must be considered a classic of its time, and one of Tim Burton's finest achievements.

1187350,2,B000005QLO,"Edward has scissors for hands, but no one ever says why. All his backstory explains is that the scissors; which, like his mountain home and the personalities of the people in the surrounding neighborhood he eventually pierces, are largely exaggerated; were supposed to be temporary. But the man who invented him died just before putting on his hands.

Not that it matters much. Scissorhands, a well-mannered ghost of a man dressed in all leather like a slave in a bondage session, is annoying rather than intriguing, and I don't care anything about him. So even when a plot finally begins to develop, it's all in vain. The fairy tale epilogue, which explains the origin of snow in pastel Suburbia, is cute though.

1187419,4,B000005QLO,"This is another one of those movies I resisted for a long time. You know, the premise is rather absurd: scissors for hands? How could he do anything delicate? And then the cover photo of the earlier edition had his face full of scars, and I figured it was just another horror story.

But I turned into a Johnny Depp fan, and one day someone listed Edward Scissorhands in a list of Johnny Depp movies. THAT was HIM??? Amazing!

This is a much better movie than the posters would suggest. Yes, there is some stupid stuff about it, but the whole point was that these suburban people among whom Edward tries to have a comparatively normal life are mostly pretty stupid, and in ways most of us can recognize, at least if you think of it as the 1950s or early 1960s. Nobody ever said what year it was supposed to be, but I suspect it was meant to be contemporary. It was filmed in 1990. It takes place in a small town, probably southern given the accents, and was actually filmed in Florida. The houses are all pastel colors, and the cars are all pastel colors (none matching the garages they come out of) except for the van the teenagers drive which is dark with red and orange flames.

Edward finds a place for himself in this suburbia, first trimming trees into fantastic topiary shapes, then trimming dogs (fancy poodle cuts are just the beginning), and finally cutting ladies' hair. But when the teenagers discover he can pick locks with his hands, and sucker him into breaking into a house, things go badly awry.

It's a touching story, for all it is very funny, and eventually you will see that although he's a construction, Edward is more human than most of the rest of the people in the film.

Four stars. It would be two if it wasn't for Johnny Depp.",1337558400,2,1754,4.434782608695652

Edward Scissorhands is my favorite tim burton film and i would gladly pay double what i did for a high quality blu-ray transfer, but it just wasn't worth it for this release.",1327449600,2,687,4.639344262295082
1187453,5,B000005QLO,"I am an artist, and have watched this movie for 20+ years with warm regard. Edward is so symbolic of the heart of the artist to me. Early in the film when Edward is being created by the Inventor (lovingly portrayed by Vincent Price) I think this may have been Vincents last role? Anyhow, you see one of the most crucial parts of his creation is giving Edward a heart which is represented by the Inventor placing a sugar cookie over Edwards chest. This idea has a wonderful innocence to me. Not only that he'll have a heart but a sweet one at that.

Johnny Depp is in one of my personal favorite roles, for me at least. Edward as portrayed by Depp is emotional yet unable to show how he feels. Imagine the restriction of not being to touch the people you care about, and as a human how many things you do with your hands. Saying what you feel, expressing yourself, getting dressed, eating, praying... all with your hands. Edward Scissorhands wonderfully shows as people how we accept the odd until the odity no longer suits us. He is loved but then ultimately shunned due to his gift. Edward is lovingly crafted by the hands of the Inventor. The role of the Inventor has a certain God like quality as all the gifts needed to be a quality being are given to him minus the one thing that makes him flawed. Sound familiar? Look within yourself.

The simple quality of being loved is by far the strongest message in Edward Scissorhands. What is considered normal, and how do we react to it? Where is beauty in the world if not in the eyes of the one doing the looking?

Are we able to love without condition? And isn't it possible that a love can grow and be shared from one single moment? I believe it can. If you think like this, Edward Scissorhands is the movie for you. As a grown man, I can tell you this movie NEVER fails to put a tear in my eye. Its simply beautiful. Tim Burton has often said Halloween and Christmas are his two favorite holidays. With good reason, and I agree with this, it shows both parts of the human spirit, the light and the dark and Edward Scissorhands expresses this without fail.

Timeless and wonderful the Blue Ray viewing was a real treat since the last copy I owned was a VHS tape. I strongly recommend this to any lover of Tim Burton films, fairy tales, love stories and fantasy.

I had read great reviews about the video quality of this Blu-Ray.  I am somewhat disappointed.  The colors are great, and the detail is good, but there is some fine grain in some background scenes that seem to fibrate (the grain seems to move).  And, the vents in the outdoor air-conditioning unit suffered from video distortion, much like fine detail distorted on old-fashioned CRT TVs.  If I had not read the reviews that said the video presentation was great, I would have been pleased with the video quality.  The aspect ratio was 1.85:1, so it filled my LCD TV screen.  I would have rather had 2.35:1.

I was also disappointed in the audio, which was DTS-HD Master Audio, but only in 3.1 or 4.0 sound - there was no sound coming from the surround speakers.",1319673600,4,859,4.635761589403973

So glad this one got the BD transfer it deserved. One of Burton's best, and also one of Elfman's finest musical efforts. Depp is wonderfully understated and even Ryder comes off well, but Wiest is the real star here; she makes this movie. Arkin is also very funny, as is Baker. There are in fact few dramatic missteps here.

The colors of the ""perfect"" '60s suburb really stand out on blu-ray and bring Burton's vision all the way home. This is as much social satire as allegory/fantasy, and rarely have housewives and the American Dream been skewered so neatly. There's a whole lot of humor mixed with the pathos, a very tough combo to pull off. Burton was at his peak here in many ways and the semi-minimal budget made him work harder than he now has to, to splendid effect.

I saw this the week it came out and remember well how great it looked and felt then; this blu-ray does that original experience full justice. A great movie and a great blu-ray, even with only a commentary and short featurette as extras. It's the movie that counts, and ES shows how truly gifted and visionary Burton was, even at the start of his career. Highly recommended on every level.",1318896000,3,1177,4.516431924882629

Great movie if you haven't seen it. A lovely blend of comedy, fantasy, and romance with that Tim Burton touch that he's known for. A dark child-like creature in the middle of Suburbia (love the pastels!). I think this is and probably will be the best movie Tim Burton creates.

A modern-day Frankenstein with a more strongly emphasized heart, its one of those rare movies that succeeds by pushing its themes to the foreground instead of burying them in layers of symbology and dialogue for the persistant to uncover.  No, from the first moments of its ""Hey look, I'm a framing device"" opening to its unapologetically emotionally manipulative finale, Burton's plot, his purposefully archetypal characters, and his wry social commentaries in perfect harmony with Danny Elfman's deviously beautiful choir of little angels have one mission: to take you on a beautiful fairy tale journey, and finally literally jerk the tears out of you.

1187481,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands was Tim Burton's next project after Pee Wees Big Adventure and brought along for an encore, Danny Elfman once again of Oingo Boingo Fame. The soundtrack that Danny Elfman created for this movie is by far one of the most endearing, and most copied in it's similarity for various products being advertised during the Christmas season. Take a listen. I guarantee you that after 16 years now, you will hear a commercial this holiday season emulating this sound track once again. The mood of this soundtrack engulfs the listener with a wonderful collage of melancholy, innocence, beauty and wonder. This Elfman creation is one of the greatest musical sound tracks you will ever experience. It almost up-stages the film which is quite a compliment and accomplishment. Edward Scissorhands is an innocent, beautiful and sentimental journey of love that can never be realized between by Johnny Depp's and Winnoa Ryder's characters. As the story unfolds, one begins to understand that it isn't so much that Edward doesn't fit into society, it's more a case of the way he is abused and taken advantage of by our society in the ever predictable and unavoidable rift that human ""kind"" places upon someone that is different from themselves. I have no dought that this in turn is a closely related metaphor for Tim Burton himself. Thank God for you buddy. PQ is excellent with vibrant colors, with very good detail. SQ is the same. This is a dynamic 4.0 sound track. Still wish a 5.1 remix was done for this release, but no worries. Still sounds great! Edward Scissorhands is a story of a fragile bird's brief experiences after leaving the cage, but needing to return home to stay safe from the hostile elements. Highly Recommended!",1309651200,7,1737,4.91156462585034

1187484,5,B000005QLO,"We have watched ""Edward Scissorhands"" with other people, and been surprised when they declared it ""nice"" or ""OK"". My husband and I think this is an incredible fable.  Everytime I watch it, I tear up through the last 10 minutes.

This is worthy of Shakespeare, though I'm not sure if it would be a drama with some comedy or a comedy with some drama.  You have a scientist who creates a teenager, loves him like a son, but dies before he can complete the boy's hands. The boy eventually leaves his house on the hill, where he knew only love, and escapes his new loneliness with the help of an Avon Lady.

There is a lot of humor, and the acting is brilliant, keeping in mind that this is meant to be stylized.  There is also a nasty dose of women gossip and of women bullying. The broadest brush is used on oafish teenage boys, who instigate and incite the mob mentality that starts my crying at the end.

And what an evocative end:
""You see, before he came down here, it never snowed. And afterwards, it did. If he weren't up there now... I don't think it would be snowing. Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it.""

Innocence robbed but not beaten.  ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a lovely movie.

1187485,5,B000005QLO,"""Edward Scissorhands,"" is one of the films that really move you and makes you think.  I loved Edward , the main character, and Kim his love interest.  It was amazing how Edward was so artistic and a genous with haircuts, and how quickly the community turns on him . Brilliant acting by Johnny Depp and Wionna Ryder.  Diane Weist is also a beaultiful and talented actress.  It starts out amazing, the cute small 60's looking town , and a happy motherly Pegg Boggs , take him in like a son, and as sometimes in reality everything goes awry and Edward is chased out of town and hunted down. He is a poor innocent man who gave a lot to the town. I always found it amazing that at the tv show with John Davidson, who is a very good actor, and show host, all the women in the audience love Edward and one older woman klnows a doctor who can help him , and Peg mentions she knows a doctor who could help , but they never get around to getting him to a doctoror visit him again.  It was wonderful seeing Vincent Price, he played the part of Edward's inventor like no other could.  With real sheer genious and humanity . This is a must see film, to see how people are judged because they are different and how rumors can start and be so unfair.  A great love story between Edward and Kim, really sweet, innocent and true love.  A film that really offers a lot.",1302048000,,1351,4.209302325581396
1187486,5,B000005QLO,"Like most Tim Burton movies this is a story that could have walked right out of a fairy tale. There are elements of fantasy, of love, of miracles, and of difference in a world that is far too ordinary.

We are introduced to a small town of perfect families, of perfect houses, of stereotypical duplicates. Deco colored houses all resemble one another except for the color, husbands arrive home at the same time every night, and everyone gets by on a healthy diet of money and gossip. Shadowing the town is a mountain with a mansion atop of it where an old inventor used to live. He died leaving his invention alone to fend for himself. He is a man except for one thing: his hands. They remain unfinished and are not hands at all, they are scissors. Edward is his name and is found by one of the kinder souls of the town down below. Fearing for the young man she decides that she must bring him home to try and help him live what would be considered a normal life.

At first he is seen as a curiosity and along with his presence he brings creativity and inspiration. Suddenly nobody is a duplicate of the other in appearance, but only those that have the potential for difference are changed within, which is the more important change. Love springs between himself and the daughter of the woman that brought Edward down from the top of the mountain. For, despite his menacing appearance, Edward is the kindest and most generous person that could be conceived. His innocence and his large heart hold universes that are unattainable with the faked duplicates he is surrounded by in the village. Yet his exterior difference, the least important difference of all, lingers supreme in this world.

A powerful movie with many powerful messages. Worth it, absolutely!",1296518400,3,1759,4.631410256410256

1187489,5,B000005QLO,"Truly, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is a wonderful, beautiful movie.  It has excitement and drama, laughter and true love.  It has not one foul, four letter word! (Hooray!)  Good acting and believable dialogue, fine direction and movie music, and other production values also show the excellence of this movie, and its justly-given acclaim.  However, there is something else....something which few -- if any -- reviewers, amateur or professional, seem to have discovered about this movie.  I'm not sure if it's just not seeing the facts, or not wanting to speak or write of them.  In either case, I am totally dumbfounded as to why this should be. Because the ""hidden"", (or, rather, not-so-hidden), ""secret joy"" (to some), and ""secret knowledge"", to others, should, I think, be better known.  For it is not a shameful thing that I speak of here....it is a totally, and wonderously beautiful one....

With 418 reviews of this movie, (and counting!), it is sort of impossible for me to discover if anyone else has discerned the ""secret beauty"" of this movie.  Which is... the parallels between the life of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, and that of Jesus Christ.  Yet the parallels are SO obvious, it's amazing to me that, if they have been discovered by others, that they haven't been more widely discussed.

Firstly, Edward Scisssorhand's name, itself.  It is easily translated into ""E. Manual"", or ""Emannuel"" -- which is one name given to Jesus!

Then, Edward S. is seen to live for the first part of his life high on a hill in a huge castle.  (The parallels here to Heaven are more than obvious).  Edward is also seen to have been created(!) by a brilliant scientist.  And who can be more brilliant than God (the Father), Himself?  Soon, however, Edward S., (unintentionally?), kills his creator.  This is a parallel, I think, of Jesus, as God, supplanting the God of the Old Testament, and of Christianity supplanting Judaism as the religion of Goodness which has the greatest number of followers.

Edward is soon ""brought into"" (!) the (real) world..... by an Avon Lady!  I myself don't know too much about the connection -- but I know that the Arthurian Legends, (including Avon), are supposed to be part of Christian teachings.  Dianne Weist, who plays the part, is not Jewish -- probably to show that The Virgin Mary is a figure that belongs to the entire world. But Ms. Weist -- obviously NOT in the least anti-Semitic -- has acted in the play ""The Dybbuk"", and has made many films with Woody Allen.  The Virgin Mary is goodness personified -- and obviously, so is Ms. Weist!

Edward soon settles into the middle-class suburban neighbourhood, where his benefactress, and her husband, (Alan Arkin -- who, like St. Joseph, the foster father of Jesus, is Jewish), make their home.  True, this is not the poor neighbourhood where Jesus grew up -- but it isn't the richest part of town, either.  People here continue to strive and strain to make a living.  Perhaps, like the poorer people amongst whom Jesus grew up, these modern, middle-class people, don't know how many blessings they actually have, and continue to strive for false things like status.)  Also part of the family is the beautiful Kim, played by Winona Ryder, (also of Jewish birth).  Every name has a meaning, and I suppose, to be fair, I could easily find a parallel in Jesus' life for ANY name given to the Avon Lady's daughter. Here, the name ""Kim"" is given, and it means ""Regal Hill"", in the English derivation, and ""Golden"", in the Vietnamese derivation.  Also, ""Kim"" is a name given to both girls and boys.  To me, the character of Kim -- with whom Edward S. falls deeply in love -- represents both humanity at large, (whom Jesus loved deeply), and also the Church which grew from Jesus' teachings, (which Jesus also loved....and which, like the character of Kim in the movie, grows old, but still retains the vibrancy of her, (its) youth(ful teachings)

Edward S., now happily living with the Avon Lady and her husband, begins to use his scissors-like hands to turn the boring hedges of the neighbourhood into beautiful topiary designs!  Although showcased, not at a wedding, but at a celebration welcoming Edward S. into the neighbourhood, (which, I guess, could be conceived as a wedding, of sorts), the changing of the hum-drum hedges into beautiful images of people, places and things could, I think, easily draw a parallel to Jesus' first miracle -- that of turning water into wine!  (As could his appearance at the young son of the family's school, where he turns paper into wonderfully elaborate paper dolls!)

Edward S. then sets about giving hair-cuts to the neighbourhood ladies.  One of these ladies, er....""comes on"" to him, in a very big way.  This draws a parallel to the ""temptations of the flesh"" that Jesus was tempted by, as well.

In this movie, Edward S. doesn't actually cure anyone, or make any blind people see.  But he DOES snip off some hair from a dog's forehead, making it easier for the animal to see things.  He also helps the young son of the family when the little boy is injured.

Late in the movie, the townspeople turn on Edward.  An angry mob chases him.
But he does not die.  He returns to the castle-like fortress, high on a hill, where he was first created...  The parallels here to Jesus' life are
indeed unassailable!

But the most telling parallel between the life of Edward Scissorhands, and that of Jesus, comes at the very end of the movie.  Kim -- now an old lady -- is, (as she did at the very beginning of the movie), telling her grandchild the story of Edward S.  And Kim tells her grandchild this: that before Edward S. came there, it never snowed in their town.

.......................................................................

Was it Tim Burton's purpose to create a modern semi-fairy-tale version of Jesus' life?  Or did it just happen co-incidentally?  But I see far too many parallels in this movie to the life of Jesus for it to be a mere co-incidence.  And if it was created on purpose -- in the truly loving and beautiful way it was done -- why has no-one else, (to my knowledge, anyway), ever mentioned this?",1287360000,,6133,4.787821122740247

This is one film that someone can tell you about beforehand and the plot sounds absolutely terrible (""He has WHAT for hands?  What is this, Freddy goes emo?""), but is actually very touching and heartwarming.  I don't know how people make these kinds of things up, but it works here -- poor Edward is discovering humanity in a way that is considerably less overtly violent than the Terminator's and considerably more depressing than E.T.'s.  If you're looking for a happy ending, though, this one doesn't really deliver -- after all, Edward isn't quite human and there's forbidden love and all that.  It kind of made me hate modern society and Winona Ryder's character (not to mention her boyfriend's) for a while because I thought the poor guy deserved better, but it's not really what I would classify as a tear-jerker.

1187557,5,B000005QLO,"This movie really is a fascinating classic story.  Recently I saw this on Amazon for pretty cheap in Blu Ray and having fond memories we decided to pick it up.  I was curious if I would still enjoy this one so many years later or if it would just feel too dated.  To my enjoyment that was not the case.

The movie seems to be a blend between several decades.  The houses all look straight out of the 1950's or 60's as well as many of the styles yet the cars and some clothing looks more 70's but then there is mention of things like CD players which really make it even harder to figure out the time frame since those are from the mid to late 80's.  I believe this was an important aspect of the film as it tries to show a simple life and a throw back to a supposedly simpler time until Edward comes in and turns things upside down.

The town feels so 'plastic' and cookie cut with bright colors that it really does a good job contrasting with Edward's world which is dark, gritty, with lots of grey while his clothing is anything but simple and ordinary.

Blending the two worlds is done really well as Edward tries to adapt.  But the seemingly simple community is full of back biters who are all just fair weather friends with the exception of the family that takes Edward in and a few others.

I especially loved a semi minor character in the police officer who seemed to not only understand how fickle the community was but also understood some of the challenges Edward faced and was sympathetic and genuine to him.

Oh and Vincent Price is well... priceless as the creator of Edward even though he does not get much film time, he plays a critical role flawlessly.

Overall after all these years I still love this film, perhaps even more than before since I feel I understand it more.  Highly recommend this one to anyone and it looks great on Blu ray.",1254441600,6,1856,4.314121037463977

Overall the movie is slow - you can only cut so many bushes, hairdo's, dogs, etc before a need for more action or an ending comes to mind.

Peg Bogs the Avon lady brings him home to her family - this takes a leap of faith to believe.  Of course Edward Scissorhands is misunderstood and gets into sad and illegal situations he is blamed for.  He gets in trouble with the law and the neighborhood no longer wants him around.

1187570,4,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands (Tim Burton, 1990)

I've seen Edward Scissorhands at least five or six times now, and yet I don't see any record that I've ever reviewed it. So now it's time to correct that oversight, even though in the almost twenty years since its release, pretty much everyone else has already done so.

Plot: the title character (Johnny Depp) has been living in isolation in a dilapidated mansion since the death of his creator (Vincent Price). Suburbia has crawled in in the interim, and intrepid Avon lady Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest of TV's Law and Order) heads up to see if anyone's interested in facial cream. When she discovers the squalor in which Edward lives, she brings him home to experience all the comforts of suburbia. With scissors for hands, Edward immediately captivates the neighborhood with his hedge-sculpture and barbering abilities. When he falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), however, his former fans start to wonder if someone so out of the ordinary can really fit in. It doesn't help that Edward, who's badly-socialized after living alone for most of his life, is eager to please everyone he meets, and because of this falls in with a bad crowd.

As you have to expect, given that this is a Tim Burton film starring Winona Ryder, this is all about being an outcast in suburbia (think Beetlejuice here), but Burton avoids making this a simple retread of the film that made him a star by keeping the fantasy elements to a minimum. Which is kind of odd to say about a movie that centers around what is essentially a cyborg with large blades in place of hands. But compared to the over-the-top supernatural wackiness that was Beetlejuice, the world of Edward Scissorhands seems downright normal. And, of course, there's the minor change that where the title character in the former film was most definitely the bad guy, in this case, it's the humans that are the monsters, where Edward himself is just a big kid who doesn't quite know that you can't actually be friends with everyone.

The genius of Tim Burton's artistry, and the reason his movies are almost guaranteed hits, is that his vision is so far left of center that ""left"" no longer becomes a valid aspect; he's simply off in his own universe, but in such a way that the end productis still commercially accessible. A difficult thing to do indeed, but Burton's resume speaks for itself; his movies regularly appear in thousand-best lists, and he's directed a handful of bona fide modern classics, including Edward Scissorhands. Given all this, you don't necessarily need to be a top-class commercial director to make your name in film history (Stan Brakhage is an obvious example), but Burton very much is. Maybe that's why his films are, more often than not, smashes at the box office as well as with the critics. His vision is complemented with fantastic camerawork, top-notch sound, excellent acting from the entire cast, and a message that's evident without being terribly overdone. A wonderful movie all around. ****",1242950400,3,3024,4.854651162790698

Dianne Weist, Alan Arkin, and Kathy Baker are a perfect supporting ensemble; the desperate housewives far superior to the housewives of ABC.  O-Lan Jones is the religious fanatic who becomes a part of the tide that turns on Edward int he second half of the story, so you love to hate her. Vincent Price is memorable in his last film role. And finally, Anthony Michael Hall is Jim the main antagonist. He is the one who insults and fights against Edward. Hate him for what he is, will you?

The music itself should be notable in the film. Danny Elfman works the story with lots and lots of orchestral emotion. The suburbia music is catchy and a bit jazzy; the soft and lyrical moments just HAVE to be heard.

With all the characters, music, art direction, costume design, and cinematography, it's a big wonder why there are not that many special features on the DVD. Beside the interesting audio commentary by Buton and Elfman, there are only a featurette that was made back when the film was being made, and some sound bytes. There are no deleted scenes or outtakes or any of that sort. I really hope that the next time this film is released, they at least put in some audio commentary by the actors, a 90+ minute behind-the-scenes documentary, etc.

1187577,5,B000005QLO,"I saw this wonderful movie in 1990 when it first came out. I was already a Tim Burton fan of sorts, but this made me a Burton fanatic. I saw it first with my wife, and I remember thinking at the very beginning, when Danny Elfman's haunting, beautiful score was only a few notes old, that I was going to love this film. And I did. It just hit me right in the heart, in the most vulnerable, deepest part of my soul. I know that sounds pretentious, but it's the best I can do with my limited writing ability. Now understand, I was 39 years old at the time, a pipefitter/welder by trade, certainly not someone people would think of as ""sensitive"" or ""artistic"" by nature. I've been in more than my share of fistfights, ride a Harley, and love guns, power tools, and anything that explodes. But by the end of Edward Scissorhands, especially at the Ice Dance scene, I was sobbing like a little girl. My wife had to help me out of the theatre, because my eyes were so tear-swollen I could barely see. I admit I have a weakness for characters that are outsiders, or (to borrow from Heinlein) ""strangers in a strange land"", but what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp did with this scissor-handed man was nothing short of magical. I took my 16 year old daughter to see it the next day, and I started tearing up at the beginning this time, knowing what was coming. As we left the theatre, Liz was stone-faced, and I was desperately clenched against the flood of emotion I was holding back. I didn't want to look like a fool in front of her. When we got into the sunlight, we looked at each other, and I saw that she was trying as hard as me not to break down. Which is exactly what we both proceeded to do, right there in front of the theatre. We held each other and sobbed. And I felt closer to her than I had in a long time. Thank you, Tim Burton, for that moment.",1226016000,4,1848,4.208450704225352
1187588,5,B000005QLO,"I am a fan of Tim Burton, not a huge one, but a fan none-the-less.  I have always admired his visual style and his visionary status; that is to say that I admire the way he is always true to himself.  There is no director out there like Burton, and thus each and every Burton film is undoubtedly a Burton classic.  There is no question when one watches a Tim Burton film that it is without doubt a Tim Burton film.

No use beating a dead horse; I'll move on.

With all that said, `Edward Scissorhands' is without doubt Tim Burton at his very finest.  Everything about this film lives and breathes like a Burton fantasy, but at its heart it actually surpasses everything he's every done and delivers a shockingly relevant story of humanity.  That's one thing that I've always teetered on with Burton.  Like I said, I am a fan of his visual style, but as a whole I've never felt a serious connection to his work.  He has infused most everything he's done with a sense of sentiment, but it always felt forced or at best masked by the artistic aspects of his films.  With `Edward Scissorhands' though Burton has managed to make a film that looks like a Burton film yet feels much more emotionally grounded.

The film tells the story of Edward, a Frankensteinesque monster who was created yet never finished.  Before he was given a set of human hands his creator died.  Thus, Edward has been living alone in a castle not to far from a 1950's style American suburb.  One day the local Avon representative, Peg, makes her way up the gothic style walkway to the front door of the creepy yet impressively beautiful castle and meets the pale faced, scissor handed Edward.  Touched by the young mans loneliness she invites him to come back to her home and thus our fairy tale begins.

In the bustling little town Edward soon finds himself a local celebrity, but his celebrity status is easily tarnished as the locals begin to take advantage of him, and eventually turn on him when he doesn't react and or act in the ways in which they think he aught.

The beauty of `Edward Scissorhands' is that it never sacrifices substance for the glossy packaging that it so gallantly wears.  It is a stunning film visually, but it is even more stunning emotionally.  It mimics the classic monster movies of old, most notably that of `Mary Shelly's Frankenstein' but it brings its own set of heart to the core and delivers a uniquely captivating picture that stands apart as Burton's masterwork.

The acting is wonderful here as well; Depp proving that he can do so much with a character that says so little.  Winona Ryder is wonderful as the apple of Edward's eye, and Kathy Baker is infectiously mischievous, but this entire film belongs to Dianne Wiest who is just flawless as the clueless Peg.  Everything about her performance is dynamic, truly capturing the heart of her character.  We are drawn to her, as she is to Edward, and her lack of Oscar nomination makes me eternally disappointed (although she has two Oscar wins to her name so I can't be too disappointed).

In the end `Edward Scissorhands' is, to me, a masterpiece.  Yes, it is not only the best film of the year that was 1990 but it is truly one of the best films that has ever been made.  Tim Burton has rarely been this good.  Yes, he is a great director, but this is beyond him.",1220832000,2,3326,4.509181969949917
1187589,4,B000005QLO,"This is a great movie! Depp plays a tragic character who is trying to fit in to the ""pleasantville like"" town. Although this movie can be sad at times, there are plenty of funny scenes.",1220659200,2,185,4.314285714285714

Then mix in Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, and you've got yourself an incrediby moving film you just won't be able to get out of your head for days afterwards. I don't know enough about this film to give it full justice in a review, but I will say that I put off watching this film for many years, and probably would have for many years more had my friend not leant me the DVD, and that's a choice I highly regret. A must see film for everybody, yes it's odd, quirky + off-beat but it's humour and heart and also undeniable. Excellent.",1219881600,,651,4.3884297520661155

I wanted a little more depth and I found Edward and Kim's love story too weak by half.  The suburbanites were funny and how society tends to lift things up only to tear them down was a nice touch.  Still, overall I thought it was just okay.",1219190400,,377,4.194444444444445

1187593,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands is an example of the magic that can happen when story, director, cast and crew all come together to create a classic. Tim Burton has created an alternative universe that is at once reassuringly strange and oddly familiar. It is Suburbia as seen through the eyes of an outsider: bland and identical but for their different shades of pastel tract homes. From the first frame onward I was hooked on this strange tale. On paper, who would think the idea would work? A strange boy created by a mad inventor (Vincent Price) who dies before finishing his creation and leaves him with scissors instead of hands? I was totally willing to suspend my disbelief and revel in the superb performance of John Christopher Depp II as Edward Scissorhands, and marvel at the exquisite direction of director Tim Burton. Burton really has a great visual sense, especially when he puts it in the service of his inner child. I would really like to meet his imaginary friend, but feel like I already have, and his name is Edward Scissorhands, alias Johnny Depp.

What a way to kick off the decade of the 90's and bid adieu to the 80's with a character who would make the ultimate punk rocker, or is he more Goth? The pale white make-up and asymmetrical fright wig bring to mind Robert Smith of The Cure, but the black leather bondage garb is oh so punk rock. And what could be more punk than scissors for hands and the resultant facial scars? Depp conveys the naive innocence deep within this scary package. He is the ultimate lost soul who deep down inside just wants to be loved. When asked if he is a romantic Depp replied ""Am I a romantic? I've seen Wuthering Heights (1939) ten times. I'm a romantic."" What is his method, his process when acting? ""I don't pretend to be captain weird. I just do what I do.""

[On Vincent Price] ""One of the most incredible moments I've ever had was sitting in Vincent's trailer . . . I was showing him this first-edition book I have of the complete works of [Edgar Allan Poe], with really amazing illustrations. Vincent was going nuts over the drawings, and he started talking about The Tomb of Ligeia (1964). Then he closed the book and began to recite it to me in this beautiful voice, filling the room with huge sounds. Such passion! I looked in the book later, and it was verbatim. Word perfect. It was a great moment. I'll never forget that.""

[On the Edward Scissorhands experience] I can remember when I finished Edward Scissorhands (1990), looking in the mirror as the girl was doing my make-up for the last time and thinking -- it was like the 90th or 89th day of shooting -- and I remember looking and going, ""Wow, this is it. I'm saying goodbye to this guy, I'm saying goodbye to Edward Scissorhands"". You know, it was kind of sad. But in fact, I think they're all still somehow in there.

After Edward is found and brought home by Avon saleslady Peg (Diane Wiest), he falls hard for her daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder). Winona Ryder is stunningly beautiful as the young Kim. The only thing she steals here is Edward's (and my) heart. At first she is frightened and repulsed but she eventually does grow to love the strange hedge clipper. In real life she dated Johnny Depp for many years. He had a tattoo that said ""Winona Forever"" and after they broke up, he had it reduced to ""Wino forever.""

The rest of the cast is great as well. Diane Wiest (pronounced Wee-st) is great as Avon representative Peg Boggs. Alan Arkin is great as her husband. Anthony Michael Hall has come a long way from either 16 Candles or Six Degrees of Separation. Here he plays Jim, Kim's boyfriend, who is a bully, a downright brutish thug, even. The housewives of the town are a little too desperate to fit in on Wisteria Lane, but perfect for Burton's suburban milieu. Stand outs among them are Kathy Baker as red headed hot tomato Joyce, and Conchata Ferrell as hard hearted Helen. She is now familiar as the housekeeper Berta from the television program Two and a Half Men, with Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer; still filming new episodes while also seen daily in syndication.

To top it all off, Vincent Price caps off a stunningly illustrious career with this masterpiece that seems tailor made for his unique talent. He has a small but pivotal role as the mad inventor and creator of Edward. It was the omega for Price, but for Depp the alpha of his long strange journey.

Peg Boggs: Why are you hiding back there? You don't have to hide from me - I'm Peg Boggs, your local Avon representative and I'm as harmless as cherry pie...
[Sees Edward come toward her]
Peg Boggs: Oh - I can see that I've disturbed you. I'll just be going now...
Edward: Don't go.
Peg Boggs: [sees his scissor hands] Oh, my. What happened to you?
Edward: I'm not finished.

1187594,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands is and has been one of my favorite movies.  True, it is not going to be a movie that most people can get into, but this can be said for most of Tim Burton's films.  I would not suggest those who have not seen this movie to buy it, but to rent it first... though I can say that for just about any movie.

DO NOT BUY THIS BASED ON 5 STAR REVIEWS - rent it first or buy a cheap used DVD if you must.  I've found that most people find this too weird for their taste.  Which is expected; not everyone will like the same things.

I will say that I am disappointed in the hype that has surrounded this and many other films in the last few years, endorsed by those who have yet to see the film because they ""have to"".  This will lead to many good reviews and many disappointed buyers. remember - rent first.

That said, this film is one of my favorites.  I have always liked the oddity of Tim Burton's work (with the exception of Sweeney Todd, but I never like that musical anyways) and this is one of his early showcases of said odd work.  I loved this movie as a child, and can still watch it and be amused.  It is a combination of comedy and drama, ending somewhat tragically.  I felt the story was complete, having a strongly defined beginning, middle, and end.  A good deal of the styling is obviously that of the late 80's and early 90's, but this can be said for many films of the time.  This is also Vincent Price's last movie.",1213660800,2,1447,4.121428571428571
1187595,5,B000005QLO,"This movie never gets old.  Johnny's character is so innocent and sweet, you can't help but love him.  The whole Tim Burton effect is evident also.  It's a win win movie and I'll never grow tired of it.",1212278400,,202,4.2631578947368425
1187596,4,B000005QLO,"""Edward Scissorhands"" comes from the fertile mind of Tim Burton.  Telling the story of an outcast learning to be accepted by society and of its dark side, it manages to balance the line between funny and touching without breaking into pathos.  The whole cast is strong and it is notable that this was Vincent Price's last film role.  This is a film that should be seen more than one time to get all the little nuances and set pieces in it.

I notice things now that I've never seen before with the DVD or VHS. It's really that good quality. Now about the movie, not much can be said that hasn't already been said. It's an incredible movie that balances drama, comedy, and tragedy with one of the best movie scores I've ever heard. Complements to Danny Elfman for composing the music. Tim Burton has made one of the most memorable movie characters of all time. I couldn't recommend this movie any higher. You'll laugh, you'll cry (and I'm a 20 year old guy and I still can't hold back my tears) and you WILL want to see this movie again.",1209168000,7,732,4.389705882352941
1187609,3,B000005QLO,"This movie would have worked much better as a short than a full-length film.  To say this is a classic is preposterous.  It has a very strong, but limited vision.  The characterizations are clear, as is the moral tale, the color palets, the dichotomies.  But please, this is not genius.
Like Eraserhead, the limited vision of the movie becomes tedious at times.  Several aspects (such as Price's role, several scenes of the frustrated housewifes, Anthony Michael Hall) are mundane.  The goth appearance of Depp is striking for 1990.  Burton's stop animation works are a much better realization of his creativity.",1204675200,,612,5.06

I did thuroughly enjoy it though, it truely is a great little classic Burton film in all apspects of those words. If you've never seen it, I suggest you do especially if you are a big Burton fan.

1187616,5,B000005QLO,"'Edward Scissorhands' is a work of visual excellence and stylistic beauty that can scarcely be described in writing. Director Tim Burton soars past the brilliance of his other films to bring us this touching story of a man created by an inventor and raised in isolation from the surrounding town. The artificial man, Edward, played to the point of near-perfection by Johnny Depp, is someone different in a world where conformity is everything. In stark contrast to the nearly-identical houses painted in a narrow, but bright palette of colors, and 1950s-style people, is a pale artificial man residing in a mansion overlooking the town where he creates works of art with his hands in hedges, ice, and even hair. Edward appears in bland, subdued colors to better contrast with the bright colors of the rest of the neighborhood. While the town's initial reaction to Edward's appearance is shock, curiosity, and even admiration, it quickly turns into something ugly and Edward becomes an outcast to all but the few people he loves and who love him in return.

Tim Burton's fairy-tale film is not only a work of art to rival some of the painted masterpieces of the world; it is also a strong comment by the former Disney animator on the treatment of society towards distinction and its reaction to things that differ from its status quo. Danny Elfman helps this film incalculably with his original score which compliments the film perfectly and only adds to the overall magnificence of the picture. Remarkable performances from Johnny Depp, Winona Rider, and Dianne Wiest are utterly flawless and a tribute to the skill of the actors themselves. Tim Burton combines a soundtrack which can only be adequately described as whimsical, performers who could scarcely have more perfectly cast in their roles, visual effects which are absolutely stunning, and Burton's own amazing style of film-making, 'Edward 'Scissorhands is not only a glimmering jewel in the career of Tim Burton, but a film worthy of a place in the list of the best films ever made.",1196208000,2,2043,4.973684210526316

The plot is a disaster.  It reminds me of the kind of plot that junior high kids come up with in creative writing class; no climax and no idea how they are going to end the story.

The movie revolves around a cheap Pinocchio-like cliche.  You've got a miserable outcast-robot with scissors instead of hands.  The only redeeming thing that he can do is cut bushes into insteresting shapes and carve ice-statues.  Edward Scissorhands turns even more tragic when he falls in love with some girl.  He's got a big heart but every attempt at affection turns into disaster because of his scissor like hands.  As a viewer with a heart, you can't help but feel sorry for him, so the movie turns out to be a two hour long Pityfest.

He accidently cuts people, he's insulted and rejected by everyone, and leads a depressing existence.  He is so misunderstood that the police even go after him after he accidently cuts people with his razor sharp appendages.

(5 stars) I Will Never Forget This Movie, June 3, 2000
Reviewer:  Kitten With a Whip ""kittenwithawhip""

I am a huge Tim Burton fan, and love all of his movies and own them, have watched them at least 10 times each, and each one is really special to me (I know how dorky that sounds) but this is the one I am the most emotional about. I can't think of any other movie that has made me cry as often during the course of the movie, or as hard. When I saw it in the theater, I wasn't just tearing up, I was sobbing by the end. During the scene where Vincent Price (God I miss him) perfectly cast as ""The Inventor"" tells Edward he has a special present for him and hold up a pair of perfect hands, only to slip away at the last moment, I looked around the 3rd time I saw in the theater, and literally everyone in the theater was choked up if not outright crying, including grown men. If I ever want to cry on demand, all I have to do is simply *remember* the last scene of the movie, and the last few lines uttered by the storyteller, and I tear up. Just pulling up the image of Ryder, spinning around in the 'snow' dreamily, can still bring tears to my eyes 9 years later. I think this is the only movie I've seen where I actually had to sit there all through the credits trying to pull it together because I couldn't stop crying. My friend and I were still sniffling walking out of the theater. Other women out there: this is not a movie to watch when you have PMS, not unless you want to totally break down in a sobbing, emotional heap.

There's so many great things about this movie-- Tim Burton is a genius, plain and simple, and the art direction is brilliant. His vision of suburbia is great, with rows and rows of identical, colorful 50's style tract houses and flawless green lawns. The imagery will stick with you long after the movie is over; for instance, the shot of the little girl, getting told a bedtime story (the film's framing device) in a huge, oversized bed, almost buried in all the quilts and pillows, or the inventor's workshop, with an assembly line pumping out gingerbread men. Elfman does do his best work (other than Beetlejuice). Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp were a couple at the time the movie was made, deeply in love, and it shows. It actually hurts to look at them, and Ryder, even with a horrible blonde wig, is stunningly beautiful and radiant. Just the way they look at each other, the longing in both their eyes, the tenderness when she says, ""Hold me"" and Edward replies sadly, ""I can't"", so Kim (Ryder) lovingly wraps her arms around him instead-- it gets me every time. All the casting is great (Vincent Price, especially -- obviously, Tim Burton got his dream cast for this one). Anyone who has ever felt like an outsider, or lonely, or longed for someone they know they will probably never end up with, will be touched deeply. (Starcrossed lovers always get to me). Yeah, I know. This all sounds very corny, but this movie is really in a class by itself. Period.",1187740800,,3287,4.339837398373984

I always lean towards ""Ed Wood"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"" as my top Burton pics, but now after having see this one again, I have to simply say that ES may be Burton's best. As others have stated, this film appears to be Burton bringing himself to the film more than any other. That the story and the character of Edward represent him. They both have the wild black hair, both seem a bit odd and both seem to have interesting reactions from their appearnaces and styles from the so called ""normal"" people around them. It may also be Burton's deepest film. The film has avon lady Peg Boggs(wonderfully played by Oscar winner, Dianne Wiest, who has such a positive demeanor all the way thru and a cheerful tone in her voice, especially when she always says ""Hi, Bill""), discover Edward(Depp), living alone in the gothic mansion that raises high above the neighborhood. An odd looking fellow invented by an old man(Vincent Price), with scissors for hands, he is taken home to the Boggs residence and then begins to change the people and the neighborhood around him. Like a number of fairy tales, the outcome is not always rainbows and puppies. The film is gorgeous, and has a real fairy tale like atmosphere. It's unknown exactly when the era is, since it appears to have styles out of the 60's and 70's, but there are hints of present day as well. But who cares?. It's a fairy tale, and nothing has to make perfect sense. Like the scissors. The cast is great. This may be Depp's best performance. He is so child-like and fragile, and new to everything around him, that his fear and awe are so realistic. You really feel for him and want to take care of him. This could very well be his best. I've already mentioned how great Wiest is, but so is Alan Arkin, as her husband Bill. An average joe who just seems to go with the flow. His reaction to Wiest's talk about neighbors' new curtains and such is dryly hysterical. Anthony Michael Hall is a great jerk, and Winona Ryder, well, she's just lovely here. The neighborhood ladies all seem authentic and could live in any close knit community. Gossiping neighbors?. Many can relate. Danny Elfman shines in the music department, giving the score a very whimsical, yet gothic fairy tale sound. Burton has always had one of the best ""visions"" in Hollywood, and his design here with the brightly colored neighborhood and the dark, gothic mansion, are visions to behold. So are many moments here. The ice sculpture leading the pack. The movie has it all. Laughs, drama, romance, gothic fairy tale, and Tom Jones. The developing relationship between Edward and Kim(Ryder), is an interesting one. At first it seems unlikely, but it's done so naturally and authenticly, that you end up thinking ""Why not?"". The extras are lacking and are a big disappointment. For a special anniversay edition, shouldn't it be really, um, special?. In the end, Edward Scissorhands is a masterpiece. Depp is phenomenal, and the heart and soul of this film are fully on display and affective. Pure genius.",1172361600,2,3136,4.662454873646209

The scene where Ryder dances in the snow created by Edward's ice carving is unforgettable.  She is able to celebrate who this person is--and love him as well. If I could edit out the attempted rape of Edward by the town slut (and a few ill-chosen profanities), I would show this film to youngsters.

But I leave it as an adult tale of a love that could never be fully consumated.  It is the story of the freak who is castoff by the pastel-colored ""normal"" people who never comprehend or appreciate that special individual who is Edward Scissorhands.  I hope we never see a sequel, for this work stands alone as a modern day classic.",1161561600,11,911,4.3609467455621305
1187674,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton is a brilliant visual director but with Edward Scissorhands he managed to combine these talents with pure, classic storytelling - Scissorhands is his best overall film, abandoning the slight characterizations and special effects-driven spectacle of the (albeit hugely enjoyable) Batman and serving up a convincingly detailed left-of-center fairytale romance.

The story is fairly basic, being the standard Frankenstein-esque tale of alienation and the empowerment of love. Edward (Johnny Depp) is a lonely man with scissors for hands, crafted by an eccentric inventor (magnificently played by Vincent Price in flashbacks) prior to his death. After Edward witnesses the death of his creator he stays locked away inside his mansion all day, which is located atop the otherwise cheerfully picture-perfect local neighborhood community.

Then one day a nosy neighbor decides to investigate, and ends up bringing Edward to reality. He falls in love with a local girl (Winona Ryder), and is witness first-hand to the joys of life, until accidentally injuring a young boy and becoming the enemy of the overzealous town. Soon everyone is out to get him for no good reason - the climax is beautifully done and, because Burton has allowed his characters to expand so much, it's also very touching.

The movie is decidedly odd but in a good way - the only problem is that it is occasionally quite thin when it comes to actual depth. Burton's never been as good at telling believable stories as he has mythical, exciting fables (see Sleepy Hollow for a similar example). Even Burton's Big Fish - arguably his most story-oriented film of his career - was somewhat shady. The mix of screwball dark comedy, horror, drama, romance and elements and familiar happenings of other genres results in a very different combination. You can literally ""feel"" the vibe of this picture, its heart pulsing black blood.

The movie was a childhood project of Burton, who drew sketches of Edward as a boy and used to alienate himself from his hostile surroundings by taking refuge in fictional stories involving the scissor-handed hero. As a result Burton's true affinity for the subject is evident - it's clear that he takes this entire project very seriously.

The acting is marvelous - Depp's performance is one of his finest and, arguably, one of the most convincing and fun of all-time. Depp has formed a Scorsese/De Niro-like companionship with Burton over the years, teaming up for various pictures (including Sleepy Hollow and the upcoming Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). He's always had fun relishing his over-the-top and absurdly dark roles, such as Ichabod Crane in particular. In Scissorhands he gives the equivalent of a Travis Bickle - a man who feels shunned by society, only to open his heart and have it feel crushed again. This is possibly one of the reasons the film is able to affect its audience so well to this very day. The tale does not grow old because the values are timeless.

Edward Scissorhands, despite its occasional flaws, finally gave Burton the chance to unleash his talents as a visual filmmaker along with a pretty solid story mold - the result being a sublimely dark rom-com-drama that never conforms to the typical genre clichs and becomes quite a unique film in its own little world.

1187676,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton brings to life a rare combination of elements that create story that brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it. On the surface the story is the tale of Edward Scissorhands, created by inventor Vincent Price in one of his greatest roles. ""Edward Scissorhands"" could have been another story completely, a horror story, or science fiction, or a comedy. Instead, Tim Burton creates a beautiful fairy tale set in an idealized suburbia of the 50s.

Edward has lived in a Gothic house that is intended to evoke Frankenstein's castle since his creator died. Edward's house sits perched above a stereotypical suburban neighborhood, and one day the local Avon lady, Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest), comes calling. Peg gets Edward to come home with her, where he immediately becomes the darling of the neighborhood's housewives and the bane of all the neighborhood men because of his skill with topiary and hair styling.

Of course the manly men of suburbia are not going to put up with the women of suburbia heaping their affections on Edward, and soon tensions begin to arise. Eventually Kim Boggs' (Winona Ryder) boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) comes to blows with Edward, leading to a gorgeously sad and beautiful ending that clinches the fairy tale theme.

""Edward Scissorhands"" plays on many levels. As the alien outsider Edward is confused by the rituals of suburbia, which director Tim Burton has taken to excess to highlight the hypocrisy and paranoia of suburbia in a unique way. At first Tim Burton indicates that his suburban neighborhood is perfect and the epitome of the ""middle class way."" Once the illusion is established, Tim has the women attracted, yet repulsed by their own attraction, to the less-than-perfect Edward. There comes a point where the women of the neighborhood want Edward, but since they can not truly possess Edward, they join in helping to cast him out. Jim becomes the tool that allows the women of the neighborhood to do what they can not, cast him from their midst.

In the midst of the irony, Edward and Kim Boggs develop an innocent and beautiful love for each other. Edward represents innocence, beauty, and perhaps the potential we all have. Kim sees all this, and wants it, and her decision becomes the ironic capstone of this story.

Tim Burton has created a tale with an ending that causes my eyes to water every time I see it, in spite of the many times I've watched this movie. I suspect it always will. The contrast between the world as we think it should be, and the world as it could be, will always provide fodder for our art. In this case Tim took that fodder and created cinematic and emotional gold.",1157932800,7,2657,4.77995642701525

1187688,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton is one of those kind of directors where 2 or 3 of his films out of a whole filmography goes into a debate on which one's the best. For Spielberg people say it's E.T or Schindler's List, for Kurosawa it's either Rashomon or Seven Samurai while for Ridley Scott people say it's Alien or Gladiator. You probably even disagreed with me right there, well for Tim Burton it comes down to either Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood. Well certainly this film is quite enjoyable but don't think it's one of those family films for all ages like Grinch Stole Christmas or something. But at a certain age, they'll love it.

High atop the mountain near a suburbia-like neighborhood rests an old castle with an old inventor living inside. He decides to create a son only he's not finished and has scissors for hands. Well Peg Boggs, an overanxious Avon lady goes to the castle and finds Edward and decides to bring him home. Eventually he develops a following for his talent with topiary, unique hairstyling and pet grooming. However like any small neighborhood, anything bad and it becomes gossip which leads to misunderstandings.

Since he is the title character, Edward Scissorhands has to deliver and who better than Johnny Depp. He's one of those kind of actors that you can write probably any part, no matter how wide the spectrum and he'll somehow make it work. From an effeminate pirate in Pirates of the Caribbean to a shy awkward Ichabod Crane, he gets you on his side. The rest of the cast is of course perfect from Dianne West to Anthony Michael Hall(!) to the always-a-cutie Winona Ryder. Even Vincent Price shows up as the inventor.

Of course it's a family film so it's very vibrant and colorful and full of trademark Burtonisms. One can make a case that his films tend to be great set design with the occasional good film sometimes attached to it well Scissorhands manages to be very eye-catching as well as being just a solid film. It's a real-life story interwoven with aspects reminiscent of a fairy tale and for that it's a successful mix.

There is one thing however you might want to be cautious about: its...""mature"" aspects. No there's no sex but there's some small amounts of violence(don't worry, nothing Sleepy Hollow-esque here). A couple of people are cut because of Ed's scissors with accompanying blood and there's also some small swearing(no f words). It's essentially the perfect family film for outsiders, people who can handle it but if you're thinking this is in line with Bambi or Cinderella well you'd be quite mistaken.

What are super disappointing is the extras. Basically it's a featurette(those back-patting ""that guy's great to work with"" EPK you see on TV), 2 separate commentaries by Tim Burton who's his usual non-gabby self and a score commentary with Danny Elfman. No featurette on Vincent Price who actually had his last starring role in this film? An in-depth look behind the music, art design, Depp's training with scissors, a retrospective on the making? It's quite clearly a big missed opportunity.

It's hard to recommend since my comments about its mild language and violence still stand but this is still one of Burton's better films and one of the best from the 90's.",1156291200,3,3217,4.787387387387388

1187695,5,B000005QLO,"I believe that Tim Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of the director's finest moments and one of the best films ever made. The movie wouldn't look right with some other movies on my list of the best films ever made

(Pulp Fiction, Midnight Cowboy, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, etc.)

but, in it's own way...It is. That's not to say everyone will feel that way, I know a lot of people who hate this movie. The movie is one of those movies that starts off one way and ends differently. It starts as a charming fantasy and ends violently. Which is exactly the way it should end, but it would be nice to see a happy ending. The fact is, Edward Scissorhands could just as easily be about a person with a facial deformity or something simalar. The movie is about people's inability to accept someone who's different. I think that there's probably echoes of Tim Burton's childhood for sure, but anyway. The movie opens with an old woman telling her grandchild a story about the mansion on top of the hill, this is when we meet...Peg (Dianne Weist, 'Parenthood'), the local Avon lady who goes door-to-door unsuccessfully selling her products. The neighborhood is a surrealistic farce of suburbia. It looks like Stepford and has a group of women that gossip with each other about everything...Oh and of course, there's the Jesus Freak that instantly proclaims Edward to be Satan. But, anyway, Peg decides to travel to the creepy looking mansion that sits atop a hill looking over the neighborhood. When she gets there she finds Edward, an androgynous and scarred young man who has scissors for hands. He was created by an inventor (Vincent Price) but died before he was completed. Why the inventor chose to give him scissors as a substitute, we'll never know. Peg feels sorry for Edward so she brings him to her home and the neighborhood gossip stars instantaneously. Her husband Bill (the always delightful Alan Arkin, 'Eros') and her son Kevin ask no questions and accept Edward. No one really gives him a second thought. As Edward slowly makes himself at home and the neighbor's curiosity grows, Peg's daughter Kim (the beautiful Winona Ryder) arrives home and is the only person who is shocked to find Edward and even more disturbed that he's living with them. Edward, of course, falls in love with Kim. Then there's the character that messes everything up and that's Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall, TV's ""The Dead Zone"").

Finally, Edward becomes popular around the neighborhood; Trimming hedges and cutting hair, he also becomes the object of affection for many of the woman...Especially, the pseudo-slutty Joyce (Kathy Baker, who's been put to good use in Rodrigo Garcia's movies...""Nine Lives""). Anyway, you get the idea. Johnny Depp (one of my favorite actors) is fascinating, as always. As in all his movies, he disappears into the role...If I didn't know he was playing Edward, I probably wouldn't have guessed immediately he looks so different. All the actors are great; The art direction (by ""Cat and the Hat"" director Bo Welch) is an absolute wonder. If you've ever seen a Tim Burton film, then you know what I'm talking about. He's really great at creating his own little world. Most people have already seen this movie by now but I'll say this anyway. Not everyone will like this and most people won't like it as much as me. Although, many people will relate to how Edward feels in this movie. If you've seen a Tim Burton movie, then you know what his films are like...So you should be able to decide if you want to see this or not. But, keep in mind, definitely an aquired taste.

1187696,5,B000005QLO,"With this darkly romantic and surreal fable Tim Burton got so one of the best "" fantastique "" movies of the ninenties as one of the most devastating satires of the ""american way of life"" and ,specifically, of the american middle-class. It's, then, not  a circumstance that one of the most personal Hollywood directors has been ""excluded"" from the academic circles. Reinventing through the tradition Burton has known to combine intelligently several genres ( gothic terror, scienci-fiction, grand-guignol, melodrama ), different aestetich movements ( surrealism, expresionism )and popular icons putting, in its turn, a very personal care in the pictorial motives and the vanguardist design of his productions. In fact, Burton usually uses objects, architectures and plastic elements as narrative vehicles to show the oppositions and contrasts between characters and to get a subversion of our stereotyped, much of the times manipulated, way of looking the world: for example, the imbalance between the gothic-style castle where Edwards lives and the exhaustly kitsch design of most of the houses of the closer district. We find another subversion in the figure of the scientist ( Vincent Prince )that has created Edward, a character that smashes the mad doctor stereotype so habitual in low-budget horror movies. The disturbing look of the machines he has invented finds its exact opposition in the duties they do: they have been designed to make inoffensive, domestic tasks like to fabricate sweets. In the same way the threatful look of Edward contrasts with his humanity; a humanity that find its reverse in the foolish and pompous behaviour of his adultareted neighbours: the true freaks of the show, more than a caricature of the prefabricated societies and the sense of emptiness that our beloved capitalism has carry us.",1151712000,4,1826,5.318339100346021

I had not seen the movie in years when I came across it in the store a few years ago. Of course I bought it because it brought back memories and this movie is still as wonderful as it was sixteen years ago.

A tragic fairy tale about a man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who was invented by an old, lonely inventor (Vincent Price). Unfortunately, the inventor died before he was able to complete Edward, leaving him with sharp, metal scissors for hands. Edward was left alone until one day he was befriended by a kind Avon lady named Peg (Diane Weist). Peg invited Edward to come home and live with her and her family. This sets Edward on a long, exciting journey learning how to live as others do in suburbia. Edward is faced with finding a job (Cutting hair), a woman in the community named Joyce (Kathy Baker) tries to seduce him, he falls in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Wynnona Ryder), and has to deal with being bullied by Kim's boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall).

This is such a wonderful story told through the creative imagination of Tim Burton. Edward's innocence will tug at your heart as you watch this fragile creature go from being the talk of the town to the thing they fear most. Definately one of Johnny Depp's top performances. This is also the most creative and heartfelt fairy tales I have ever seen. Great for people of all ages. I recommend it to everyone.

The movie

We talk about a fairy tale in a Burtonesque style, for those familiar with his works (and specially his lovely poem book ""The melancholy death of oyster boy"") the story of this film should not be unexpected. A young man comes to town who instead of hands has scissors, you can then imagine how difficult can it be for this guy to express himself with this physical ""limitation"", the metaphor Burton uses in this character is simply beautiful and the story and the turns it takes have made it the classic it is considered today. Filled with classical Burton visuals and humor (there's a part of the film in which we get to listen Tom Jones' ""With these hands"" while a woman tries to seduce Edward) it is a compelling love story with an ending that will break your heart.

As for the extras offered in this so called ""new"" edition, they are the same from the previous one! The disc contained here is the exact same disc released for the 10th anniversary. Even though the physical presentation is different, the contents and menus are exactly the same. As an added value we now have the beautiful white tin case and 6 postcards with pictures from the film in a very nice envelope. Having said that, it is now your choice if you buy this or not, I had to sell my old edition to buy this one, I personally believe the cards and the case are a nice added value, though I was not willing to have two copies of the same film.",1145232000,4,1619,4.336633663366337

1187733,5,B000005QLO,"The amazing thing to me is how long I procrastinated before buying Edward Scissorhands. I had always believed that it was another poor horror film, considering it is still an infant effort from the master of film, Tim Burton. However, I saw it on FX, and I was blown away. This is American film at its finest. The story is so well-crafted, yet so juvenile that it seems like a 6-year-old could have devised it. But considering that this is Tim Burton at his finest, it is so much more than that. You begin to feel the angst that Edward feels. This brings me to the acting, which is DEFINITELY Johnny Depp's best collaboration with Tim Burton, possibly his best film ever. Depp conveys so many emotions with so little words that he speaks about as much as Woody Allen at a 50 Cent party, yet gets as many points across as Star Jones on cocaine. It really is a truly amazing performance. Tom Hanks owes his performance in The Terminal to Depp's here bigtime.

Tim Burton's style is what drives the film. Edward is a black-and-white freak in a pastel world. His amazing level of not belonging is almost endearing, and surely this movie will bring tears to the eyes of even the most adament of tough guys. Winona Ryder and Michael Anthony Hall are the supporting cast. Ryder is somewhat fake in her somewhat fake role, but succeeds partially nonetheless, and Hall is Jim, her boyfriend and a bully of Edward. He is completely believable, and you will have no problem hating him early in the film.

Edward Scissorhands also carries an incredible moral, and thatr is that when you are a novelty as he is in this world, your ""friends"" are prone to turn on you any time, just as they do on Edward. By the way, his friends are desperate, lonely housewives from the neighborhood. They use him to trim hedges and cut hair, two of his amazing abilities. But when he is accused of criminal activity, they're quick to dump him.

Overall, Edward Scissorhands is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is the best Johnny Depp movie and one of the best, if not the best Tim Burton film. An incredible achievement.",1126828800,7,2100,4.5065616797900265

1187747,5,B000005QLO,"This is quite possibly one of the most magical movies I have ever seen. In one sentence, this is the story of a young man yearning to accepted and loved, but who sadly isn't cut out for this world. It is inevitable: it will make you cry.

Johnny Depp plays Edward Scissorhands, an incomplete, timid and bizarre character, who was created in a large castle by an inventor. Unfortunately, his inventor (Vincent Price) dies before he was able to finish Edward. Edward looks like a normal human being, except he has ghostly pale skin and large blades for his hands. He sounds monstrous, but he is probably the most lovable creature imaginable.

One day, a naive Avon lady named Peg (Diane Wiest) going door-to-door discovers Edward all by himself in a huge castle, and invites him to live with her and her family. Edward hardly speaks a word, but he doesn't need to. Every adorable expression on his face tells us that he would do anything to have even just one friend. Everyone in the neighborhood finds him mysterious, but they quickly accept him. Edward then shows them his wonderful talent at cutting bushes into miraculous shapes. Soon, Edward is doing everything from ice-sculpting to hair-trimming. He is in love with his new life.

He finds that he is also in love with Peg's daughter, Kim, played by Winona Ryder. At first, Kim is frightened by Edward. But she slowly realizes how warm and loving he is, as opposed to her current boyfriend. The most unforgettable part in this movie is later when Kim asks Edward, ""Hold me,"" and Edward's response is ""...I can't."" He wants so badly to hold her, but at the same time he is afraid of harming her. At this point, I'm melting in my chair.

Anyway, everything is going perfectly, until a few accidents happen. Let's just say that, in the eyes of the neighborhood, Edward's hands go from being helpful tools to deadly weapons. Everyone immediately turns on him, and Edward finds himself completely alone again.

I won't tell any more, so that I don't spoil the story. I will tell you that this movie has a sad ending. My opinion is that this role is probably Johnny Depp's best. He gives Edward the perfect blend of sadness, happiness and innocence. Be sure to have plenty of tissues, but also be prepared to laugh at Edward's awkwardness and silliness. Most of all, be prepared to fall in love with Edward Scissorhands.",1124841600,5,2369,4.671462829736211
1187748,5,B000005QLO,"This may or may not be Tim Burton's greatest film but is inarguably his first personal one.  Prior to ""Edward Scissorhands"", Burton had success with ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"", ""Beetlejuice"", and ""Batman.  These blockbusters afforded Burton the luxury of being able to call the shots as to what projects he wished to tackle.  Fortunately for us, this offbeat yet sweet fable was Burton's pet project.  It also gave Burton carte blanche as to who he would cast in the title role.  There was nothing in Johnny Depp's past to suggest that he could tackle the demands of this role.  Yes, he had a small role in ""Platoon"" but he was primarily known as a teen idol on the fledgling FOX network's ""21 Jump Street.""  But Depp was eager to break from that straightjacket and as Edward Scissorhands does he ever. If you examine his performance closely it's a very intricate one.  Despite the Robert Smith of the Cure getup and razor appendages Depp is able to convey the poignance that's at the heart of his character.  If you also notice his character speaks very little and it's usually very softly.  Depp, like a great pantomime or silent movie actor, does it mostly with facial expressions and gestures.  Burton assembles a great supporting cast here(Dianne Wiest, Winona Ryder, Alan Arkin, Kathy Baker).  There's also  highly imaginative art direction by Bo Welch and another clever score by Danny Elfman.  I hadn't seen this film in ten years or so but along with ""Ed Wood"" and ""Big Fish"" this is one of Burton's crowning achievements.",1124496000,2,1530,4.790076335877862

The population, mostly the housewives, grow to love him as one of their own.

Edward falls in love with a girl named Kim (Winona Ryder), who at first resents him, but grows to love him, as the town's love for him dies.

The film in itself shows us how human nature expects normalcy, but instead is sometimes greeted with the abnormal and freakish. Our nature is to be afraid of things we do not understand. That is what Tim Burton shows us in this film. Edward shows us that what you see is not what is there. On the outside, he looks freakish, ghostly, and a little monsterous. However, he is probably one of the purest-hearted people you would ever meet.

Well I had weird tastes then and I have weird tastes now. I'm still yearning to live in a fairy tale and I'm still in love with Edward.  I think his childlike tenderness appealed to my own just peaking youth and today it riles up nostalgia that produces the same warm feelings.

Burton's movie is a spectacular take on the tragedy of humanity always unable to accept and understand each other if it stands in the way of protecting themselves.  But Burton brings out the compassion in any (willing) member of the audience and reminds watchers that there is humanity and love in the strangest and even the most dangerous of creatures.",1123113600,,862,4.39622641509434

1187763,3,B000005QLO,"I really thought I would like this movie, I usually like interesting stories about alienated characters, but this was just too sentimental.

The movie's number one problem: the characters are too clich. I know they wanted to go for a fairytale style story, but that doesn't mean the characters have to be 100% artificial. Couldn't they have done a bit more to minimize the feeling that we're watching mindless, one-dimensional caricatures simply existing for the sake of the movie? The characters have almost no depth at all. For example, why did Kim ever fall in love with Scissorhands? She never had a reason to, and the explanation given was not good enough. She went from almost being disgusted of him to... LOVING him? Not just being his friend, not finally accepting him for who he is, or even just his best friend, but loving him...romantically. That's completely absurd. She was initially disgusted by him, but it's after seeing him on TV and finding out that he would ""do anything for her"" that she begins loving him, I feel silly just typing that. I'll tell you why she fell in love, it's because the plot called for it.

In the end when Ed saves the kid from being hit by the van, that felt like a convenient scene to throw in to show Ed as a hero and to draw empathy, but it makes no sense at all. Why would The Dead Zone's Anthony Michael Hall keep driving full speed after seeing the boy in the street? Even if he was drunk he would've made some attempt to swerve after seeing his girlfriend's brother about to be hit, and you can't tell me he didn't see him.

1187764,5,B000005QLO,"On my second viewing of Tim Burton's dark fable, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS made a stronger impression and it stands as one of, if not the best, of Burton's films.  An atmospherically gorgeous film, it tells the story of a would be Pinocchio, whose maker doesn't get to give him hands before he dies.  Vincent Price in his last role is hauntingly charming as the Inventor.  Johnny Depp brings a tremendous amount of innocence, loss, and fascination in this extremely difficult role.  Depp has proven to be one of our finest young actors and this is one of his finest roles.  Witness Depp as he ferociously makes his topiaries; how he longs to be human and loved by Winona Ryder; how he is hurt when he is made fun of.  I can't imagine any other actor infusing Edward with such humanity.  Ryder is genuinely astonishing as the young girl who Edward falls for, and with her radiant performance, Winona proves herself to be a formidable screen presence.  The cookie cutter suburban existence is captured beautifully in the pastel houses and in the empty personas of the people who live in them.  Dianne Wiest is marvelous as the Avon lady who brings Edward down from his castle home; Alan Arkin shines as her bowling husband.  Kathy Baker oozes seductive lust and loneliness in her role as the lady who wants Edward bad; and Anthony Michael Hall is a strutting pile of machismo in his villainous role, quite a departure for him at the time the movie was made.  EDWARD, of course, is an allegory on misfits, how hard it is for someone different to fit in, and if you do fit in at the whims of others, how easy it is to betray them.  EDWARD SCISSORHANDS is a visually hypnotizing film, and one with lots of heart in its story.  A truly classic fable for our times.",1118188800,3,1752,4.54140127388535
1187765,5,B000005QLO,"From the same brilliant mind of the writer who gave us ""Beetle Juice"" and who would later give birth to ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and the director of ""Big Fish"", came ""Edward Scissorhands"". Unforgivable as it is, until yesterday I had not had the honor of watching this jewel in its entirety. Now, I can say with confidence Tim Burton has my respect and admiration and is definitely my favorite storyteller.

Edward Scissorhands, in retrospective, brings to the forefront some elements that modern society and us as humans are so full of. A rejection towards new things and different-looking people, while we claim to be so open-minded. Our inevitable doom to hurt even those whom we love the most, while we are afraid or under (perhaps) too much pressure or anguish. But most of all, the natural ability to love innocently that resides in the heart of us all, if we let it flow and don't suppress it with loads of artificial fluff that only fill but don't fulfill.

Edward Scissorhands is, quite simply, a classic that will stand the test of time, as it has so far. Fifteen years after its making (at the time of this writing), it is as fresh and packed with lessons as it was back in 1990.",1117670400,4,1198,4.619718309859155

1187768,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton is an amazing director.  Through interesting uses of color, cinematography, characters and stories, he captures the imaginations of the audience and keeps them fully engaged throughout the duration of the vast majority of his films.  Such was the case with his 1990 film entitled ""Edward Scissorhands"".  Inspired by the Mary Shelley's (1797-1851) short story ""Frankenstein"" (which was the inspiration for many other twentieth-century films) and Carlo Collodi's (1826-1890) novel ""Pinocchio"" (which has also inspired many a twentieth-century film), Tim Burton and co-writer Caroline Thompson (in her first involvement with a big-screen film) transformed these original stories into a touching modern interpretation about an inventor (Vincent Price, 1911-1993) who decides to transform one of his assembly-line robots into a man whom he names Edward (Johnny Depp).  The transformation would involve several stages so that Edward would eventually be completely human, but unfortunately, that was not to be as the inventor dies before he can complete his work and Edward, who is partially human and partially machine, is left with long scissors as hands and fingers.  Below the hilltop upon which the inventor's castle stands is a modern suburban residential area.  Each morning, the husbands, leaving at the same time, drive into the city to work, and each evening, they return at the same time.  Their wives stay at home taking care of their colorful homes and children, as well as share interesting gossip about their neighbors.  One housewife, Peg (Dianne Wiest), also works as a door-to-door cosmetics saleswoman with varying degrees of success.  One day, while unable to get a single sale, she decides to pay a visit to the castle high upon the hilltop.  There, she finds an immaculately kept garden with hedges and shrubs cut into an assortment of amazing shapes.  She walks into the castle and comes across Edward.  Seeing how he constantly cuts himself with his scissor-like hands, she befriends him and takes him back to her home, which, of course, sends the neighboring wives into a flurry of phone calls to spread the gossip.  Though Edward is quite unusual, Peg and her family accept him and try to help him have a normal life.  In the meantime, Edward begins to transform their yard into the same immaculate garden with amazing shapes as at the castle.  He then also transforms the yards throughout the neighborhood similarly, before starting to trim dogs' fur and eventually, the housewives' hair.  Edward begins to fall in love with Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), but Kim's boyfriend, Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), becomes jealous.  This jealousy eventually gets Edward into trouble and leads to a dramatic ending, not unlike the ending in Mary Shelley's 1818 story.

Other memorable characters in the film include Peg's husband Bill (Alan Arkin) and the many housewives that live nearby: Joyce (Kathy Baker), Helen (Conchata Ferrell), Marge (Caroline Aaron), Esmerelda (O-Lan Jones) and Tinka (Susan Blommaert).  Also noteworthy is Police Officer Allen (Dick Anthony Williams).  With an engaging story, wonderful characters, brilliant direction and wonderful acting, I rate ""Edward Scissorhands"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.",1115424000,4,3268,5.321011673151751

I remember watching Batman and thinking ""If only all comic book movies were like this"". IMO We never got an entertaining Comic-book movie like that until Spiderman. Then I saw Edward Scissorhands and was so touched. This seems to be Tim Burton's most personal production because things from his years growing up in Burbank inspired the idea and settings. Almost all his movies are visual feasts but Edward Scissorhands takes more of an emotional approach that I never saw in a Tim Burton movie before this. Even though the characters come across as cartoonish (which I could imagine the film almost being), but it works within the film because it is supposed to be a modern fairytale. Johnny Depp's performance as Edward was probably his best ever (even though his Jack Sparrow was a riot).  Look at the scene when he looks at the neighborhood for the first time. In addition, the ending (which I will not spoil) is beautiful but (thankfully) is not given a typical Hollywood ending. Had the ending been different I don't think the movie would have carried such an emotional resonance it did for me. And how can I not mention the score. This is one of Danny Elfman's favorite scores and I would wholeheartedly agree with him. This movie just worked so well. It helps when the director gives something that really came from the heart.

Edward knows how to love and be gentle and kind, but still, people won't accept the way he is.

1187771,5,B000005QLO,"There amidst mediocre and complacient suburbia, above the pastel and stucco eyesores of the herd's domiciles, imperiously stands the shadowy dominant mass, Lair to one Edward Scissorhands {Johnny Depp}, tragically left alone without human hands by the premature death of his father-inventor {Vincent Price}, who taught him the noble virtues of deportment and civility. The local Avon-Lady ""Peg"" {Dianne Wiest}comes around seeking to sell her wares {she is actually more gutsy than anyone else in that town}, slowly making her way through the lambent corridors into the darkest recesses of the castle, until finally perceiving movement in the delapitated attic, but despite her frightful impression, she decides to relocate Edward down with her into the booboisie dwellings. Surprisingly, her family takes a liking to the gothicesque character, clothing of tight black leather, straps and silver buckles, pale complexion, dark eyes, crowned with spiked and dishevelled hair - sort of a cross between Robert Smith and Hellraiser's ""Pinhead"" {I always thought the latter character should have had more of a regally infernal name, something like ""Lord Asmodeus"" or some such, but I digress}, redressing him in the common accoutrement of the culture.

As his presence becomes known, the local frustrated and busy-body housewives, especially one processed Tom Jones-listening lushful tart, begin yammering it up with intrigue and petty gossip, and in her case, lustful intent. And another, a comical jesus-freak who warns the other women to beware, that The Devil has arrived - when not spreading paranoia, she sequesters herself in her hovel praying and playing her organ. Edward's natural talents manifest as he attempts to settle in, displaying remarkable skills in imaginative hedge-trimming, hairstyling, and ice-sculpture, making him a neighborhood sensation with the ladies, although his charming naivetee' belies his fearsome appearence.

He becomes infatuated with the family daughter Kim {Wynona Ryder}, who eventually reciprocates his sentiments, despite the efforts of her bullying jock 'boyfriend' Jim {Anthony Michael Hall}, inclusive of framing him for a robbery, and persistent name-calling. Through this pretentious attempted intigration, Edward remains the outsider frequently displaying noble personality traits and inherent superiority, with a desire to repay the consideration given him, but instead is himself reciprocated with hypocrisy, ingratitude and hostility by the rabble. He finally reaches his tolerence level and decides to return to his total environment, his own black haven, but is persued by Jim, the misdirected masochistist, who is subsequently justifiably punished for his antagonism.

Sadly, Kim and Edward cannot live together because of these events, so she returns to the town and lives out her days in regretful contemplation, eventually relating the story to a grand-daughter one snowy night. In a most memorable and pathos-inducing scene, still as a nubile maiden, she twirls and dances in the snow produced by Edward's Magical ice creations, raining down upon the town. Apparently, being a Magical creature himself, Edward does not seem to age, but continues producing his marvels perpetually.

What this film does seem to display are the results of solipsism and pretentiousness, which are answered with ignorance and insensitivity by inferiors, despite his sincere efforts, his productive alienation is inevitable, and he remains in the purity of his darkly divine autonomy.

The music is hauntingly beautiful, conjured by Musickal Magician Danny Elfman, whose eclectic orchestrations I thuroughly enjoy through their many manifestations. The aesthetics are enthralling, repleat with trapezoidal angles and awe-inspiring perspective. I especially appreciated the sweeping staircase and the enchanted garden.

There is magic in this little gem, and I am still, to this day, sympathetic toward Edward's ""handicap"".  If only he realized that his handicap was really his gift.  he's got the right idea, though - To express himself through art, to use his ""god given"" (or in this case, man-given) talent to create something, to leave his mark.

Edward Scissorhands,by the director Tim Burton, is about an invented man (Johnny Depp), whose inventor dies before he finishes him, and that's why he is left without hands - he has scissors instead.

Edward lives alone in a big gothic mysterious castle, with no contact with the world outside, a small colorful neighborhood, until one day when Peg Boggs, an Avon saleslady, comes incidently to  Edward's house, and decides to adopt him and try to make him a normal man.

Edward moves to Peg's house, where he encounters Peg's daughter,Kim (Winona Ryder), and falls in love with her. Kim ignores him at the beginning, but by the time she learns to get to know him she develops feelings for him.

The great element throughout the movie is the blas treatment of Edward, who's clearly not quite human, by the suburban husbands and wives. They regard him as a curiosity, but are limited in their interactions with him by the strict confines of their own social mores and interests.

1187804,5,B000005QLO,"This movie is almost impossible to explain but imaginative director Tim Burton has taken parts of Frankenstein mixed it with Desperate Housewives and added a bit of Beauty & the Beast eventually arriving at a hauntingly touching tale that is perfect for any audience.

In a perfect sherbet colored community of track homes and manicured lawns there exists a woman named Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest). Peg is the local Avon lady and after running out of customers one bright spring day she decides to venture up to an old Gothic castle in hopes of finding new buyers for her cosmetics. Here she encounters a young man of a different sort all alone and begging to be taken home, meet Edward Scissorhands (Johnny Depp). Edward has been manufactured from the mind of a mad scientist (Vincent Price) and sadly has a bunch of scissors for fingers so he has spent life injuring himself and others, or so he thinks. Peg brings Edward home to her little 1960's suburban existence and as a curiosity factor he is immediately interesting to the housewives all vying for attention forcing poor Edward to indulge in all of their fantasies. During this time Edward starts to make topiaries and finds a talent for cutting hair, both for women and neighborhood dogs. He also falls innocently in love with Peg's beautiful daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). And so it goes until Edward is no longer useful to all of the hopeless housewives and falls short of his novelty existence in suburbia.

The mind of Tim Burton is unlike any other and this film exposes all of the cruelties of society and the emphasis it places on perfection. With brilliant insight from an extremely unique perspective Burton brings forth the character of Edward Scissorhands from somewhere unfathomable yet he makes him entirely relatable if you have ever felt yourself to be an outsider. Johnny Depp brings Edward to life with a vulnerable innocence that can only be compared to the greatest movie creation of all, Frankenstein's monster. Winona Ryder is the beauty to Depp's beast. And of course the desperate housewives all have their own terrific roles here too with standouts like Dianne Wiest and Kathy Baker. Another character that cannot be forgotten is of course the great horror movie king Vincent Price who has a small but quite important role here. The music of Tom Jones and Danny Elfman contributes a haunting and humorous quality to life in this creative journey. But Tim Burton deserves the real accolades for no one other than Burton could have conjured up such a distinct fairytale like world and taught such an ingenious lesson at the same time for in a world where acceptance is so entirely materialistic and the mere mention of an imperfection a complete disaster, Burton offers the possibility of something more.",1102896000,4,2781,4.87737843551797
1187805,4,B000005QLO,"I haven't watched this movie in ages, but it's marked down on my list of DVDs still to review, so I decided to put it in the DVD player. Having not seen it for at least a year, if not more, I was struck by how emotional it made me feel. If it made me feel like this before, then I definitely don't remember it.

It's one of the few Tim Burton movies I find almost magical - and how similar is Edward to Tim?! The crazy hair, the paleness, the reclusiveness? I definitely think Tim based a lot of Edward on himself, including looks. From the garishly pastel colours of the houses, clothes, and every other accessory featured in the movie, to the gothic castle overlooking the whole little town which is taken from a fairytale, and how different the castle is when you first see inside it.

I love Johnny Depp movies, and I reckon there's only a couple that I've seen & not liked. I couldn't get into Ed Wood, and although his character was good in Pirates Of The Caribbean, the film was total rubbish! This is one of his movies, a career-defining performance, when he was still trying to shun Hollywood really, although he's now trying to make movies his kids can see. Along with Benny & Joon, this was Johnny trying to be an old silent movie star, and he does it very well indeed. The simplest of facial expressions or mannerisms from him can have you laughing or crying, or simply feeling sad. The leather suit doesn't look that great - why leather?! And the scissors for hands must have been so much fun to work with! It's reported he had to lose a reported 25 pounds for the role, and he only said 169 words in this film.

There's a terrific array of characters in this, from Vincent Price's last appearance, to Winona Ryder, wearing a horrible blonde wig. Winona's character appears almost innocent in this, I especially love the scene where she hugs Edward, or when she dances under the flurry of ice when he's making an ice sculpture.

I hate the busy bodies in the movie, although the actresses who portrayed them did it well. One minute they're all over Edward, as the new, unique guy in town, and then he no sooner turns his back, than they plunge their knives in. They're almost the evil ugly stepsisters in this movie, and the hairdos, erm hello?! How awful!!! Tim Burton must have been having a laugh with those.

There's not much depth to the story - Tim Burton has never been one for telling believeable stories as he has exciting, mythical fables.

There's some terrific funny moments in this, showing off Johnny's comedic side to the viewing audience. Particularly the scenes with the waterbed (I love the look he gives the clown lying beside him!), or when he's trying to get dressed, or when he walks away after Winona's character screaming, but I don't find the alcohol drinking particularly funny.

The score by Danny Elfman is the one disappointing part of the whole movie. Having bought the soundtrack ages ago, I've only listened to a couple of tracks from it, and it doesn't really stand alone. The music in the film goes totally unnoticed, and in my case, it has more of an effect on me that way. But it's disappointing how the music doesn't have the same effect when listening to it separate from the film.

If you don't have this movie, I demand to know why not, and that you go out and get it instantly. It's definitely re-watchable, and gives you a warm & gooey feeling inside.",1101859200,6,3406,4.482258064516129

Tim Burton is my favorite director and Edward Scissorhands is what I consider to be his masterpiece. It is a modern fable for a modern world, a world that always needs a monster to hunt. But Edward is no monster...he is a lonely, kind-hearted misfit who wants to touch but can't. It isn't his fault that he destroys everything he touches; that's just the way he was made. I think that there are people in the world who can understand this concept very well. That's who this movie will touch.

There are little details in this movie that I just adore. The way Burton showed all the husbands coming home and going to work at exactly the same time, the bizarro clothing and hairdos worn by the bored and horny housewives, the drastic juxtapositon of Edward's dark and shadowy castle to the pastel cookie-cutout houses of the town below...and of course, the inconquerable and gorgeous score by Danny Elfman.

Let me just say this...it is simply perfect that Burton and Elfman collaborate on almost every single film that Burton does. The only movie by Tim Burton that did not feature a Danny Elfman score was Ed Wood. I didn't know that when I watched it for the first time, but I knew there was something amiss, something terribly wrong. Now I know what it is. These two were born to collaborate with each other. Elfman has done scores for other films (Dolores Claiborne, Red Dragon) and they do not stand out like they do in Burton's films. The same goes for Johnny Depp. He embodies Burton's vison on the screen. And luckily, in a streak of perfection, this film has all three of these people involved, along with a marvelous story and beautiful art direction.

Anyway, this is a marvelous movie. It is touching, tragic, beautiful, and funny. And how can you resist another eccentric Johnny Depp performance, complete with Robert Smith hair?

What once seemed odd, out of place, or just plain wacked, then becomes a prescient work of art that is honored as being ahead of its time, or at least ahead of the audience's understanding of it.  ""Edward Scissorhands"" is such a film.

Or, maybe it's just me.

I recall seeing this unique fantasy/fairy tale a few years ago, but didn't get to see the whole thing.  I don't recall if I was distracted, just didn't have the time, or simply didn't get it, but upon close attention at long last I find this to be a mesmerizing, beautiful, touching film that defies categorization.  This singular vision of director Tim Burton, his fourth hit in a row following ""Pee-wee's Big Adventure,"" ""Beetle Juice,"" and ""Batman,"" is a retelling of the Frankenstein legend, with the twist that this manmade man was left with scissors instead of hands because his inventor, ""who invented a man,"" died just at the moment he was about to replace those monstrous hands with more human-looking ones.

Johnny Depp plays Edward, of course, with pancake makeup, an electric hairdo, and a sense of Little Boy Lost that the women in the film can't resist, the chief of whom is eventually young and beautiful Winona Rider in her natural blonde (yes, her usual black hair is a dye job).  The fantasy element of the film allows us to overlook its anachronistic nature, as Edward is adopted by an Avon lady who lives in a neighborhood straight out of Jackie O's early to mid '60s suburbia yet one of its inhabitants talks about needing a new CD player.  We also see his home and its extremely modern security system.  And little details like, what did Edward eat for all those years when he was helpless and living alone and apart from the world, and why in heaven's name was he given scissors for hands in the first place?

These are bothersome things, but the whole film is so unreal that they somehow don't intrude enough to mar either the atmosphere or the story.  It's a fairy tale, after all; questions of such nature are not welcome or required.

Burton belongs to that pantheon of directors whose work bears a unique stamp, visually and aesthetically otherwise, so that it's clear that you're watching a Burton film.  That puts him in an elite group of directors, such as Hitchcock, Spielberg, Kubrick, Scorsese, Bergman, Tarantino, Fellini, Spike Lee, Sidney Lumet, David Lynch, Woody Allen, Robert Altman, etc., not bad company to be in.  ""Scissorhands"" reeks of Burton's rich textures of visuals and sounds that are slightly off yet perfectly interwoven, matching the story and the angle he wants to take with it.

It also carries the delicious depth of story that one has to plumb after viewing.  Is the title character a representation of Burton himself, the self-image of a freakish character out of step with his surroundings and ultimately rejected to create his beautiful works of art without being judged by ""normal people""?  Is the film Burton's way of saying that he thinks God is dead, and that He left us incomplete, with the ability to create wondrous things but also the clumsiness that leads to horrible accidents that we are sometimes blamed for except by those we love?

Perhaps both.  In any event, this is well worth repeated viewing.

A couple of nits to clear up here:  Other reviewers make the mistake of saying this was Burton's first film (way wrong) and that this was Depp's first film (again way wrong).  Burton's earlier successes are detailed above.  Deep had been featured in ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Platoon"" before he became a star on TV's ""21 Jump Street,"" and he was the lead actor in the film ""Cry Baby"" before this film came out.  Just a note added in the cause of correct information.",1098662400,10,3811,4.6947368421052635
1187808,4,B000005QLO,"I must say Tim Burton never runs out of ideas.  He has made such interesting movies in the past years among my favorites are: The Nightmare Before Christmas, Big Fish, and of course Edward Sissorhands.  It is a very sweet story about a young man who was made artificially but whose inventor died before completing him.  He is then taken under the wing of Peg the local Avon lady.  A lot of people have said this movie was pointless and dull.  I say to those expand your minds beyond anything that is obvious, search for the deeper meaning.  Edward expirences all human emotions: saddness, love, anger, pain and that is what the movie is about.  Looking beyond the exterior of someone is what this movie is trying to encourage people to do.  Peg and her family seemed to be the only ones who could do that.  The rest of the neighboors liked him until he accidentally hurt someone, than they only saw him as a monster.  This is a great movie and tears always come to my eyes at the end when he did the ice sculpture of her in the attic.",1098576000,3,1034,4.338541666666667

1187830,5,B000005QLO,"This is my favorite movie in all of Tim Burton's classic horror/gothic/fantasy films. This movie was made in 1990, and sports Johnny Depp as the childlike creation in his first movie role. I gave this movie 5 stars for these reasons:

-Characters: Tim Burton is the king of character emotions/feelings and captivates Edward's unique ignorant and bewildered traits excellently. Also, I find that every single person in this whole movie has something unique about them.

-Story: This is by far the most wonderful idea in all of movie history, excluding Batman (the origional, also directed by Tim Burton, PG-13, 1989). It has a lot of comedy, such as Edward's reactions to their 1950s style life. It also has some romance, in a slightly forbidden and unlikely manner. It has well-placed action sequences just when the tension builds up. Then, of course, there is the fantasy part. The real reason I enjoy this movie is how creative, origional, and uncanny it is. Who else could have thought of an old, kind-hearted man who tries to make a man, but leaves him unfinished eith scissors for hands, than Tim Burton? What about the dark, brooding side of the story, when, you really feel for Edward, and then the pleasant tingling you feel in your body when the cheerful, colorful scenes come in? Only Tim Burton has the sheer individuality to create this vision.

-Music: Oh, yeah. Danny Elfman. My favorite composer for movie scores and winner of multiple Academy Awards, he really brings life into this movie. It seems that he could do probably any type of movie music. If it helps, he composed the music to Batman, Batman Returns, Big Fish, Spider-man, Spider-man 2, Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas (in which he also sings), and more.

-Features: Now to talk about the actual DVD content of this movie. This Anniversary Edition contains many features, like Cast and Crew interviews, an Easter Egg (secret content),and  theatrical trailers, but there is more. Also, the video and sound quality is rich and flavorful.

  If I were you, I'd buy this instant classic as soon as possible, but if you don't trust me, then just rent it first to see if my review met all of the things I wrote. Feel free to post another review concerning mine if you have a question, comment, correction, or you just have a bone to pick with me. Thanks for your time.",1098057600,2,2351,4.801980198019802
1187831,5,B000005QLO,"EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, Tim Burton's masterpiece metaphor about a humanoid creation with scissors for hands is a wonderful statement about how society tends to take the unusual and unique and, after a brief period of acceptance and curiosity, misunderstands it, vilifies it and then hastens to destroy it out of fear and ignorance.

Johnny Depp stars as the star-crossed creation who wants nothing more than to fit in and to help all those that he meets.  Depp's acting versatility shines in one of his finest roles.  Wonderful supporting roles include Diane Weist as the Avon Lady who discovers and befriends Edward and Winona Ryder as the spoiled teenager whom Edward comes to love. Vincent Price is wonderful in his cameo appearance as the eccentric inventor who gives Edward life but dies before he is able to complete his creation.

Tim Burton's creative genius comes through in spades in this wonderful movie. Danny Elfman's striking score is the finishing touch.

THE HORSEMAN",1096934400,5,980,5.1
1187832,5,B000005QLO,"This wonderful fantasy tale stars Johnny Depp as a not-quite-real teenager who was built by an eccentric inventor. The old man died before he could finish him, so Edward has knife blades where his fingers would be. A well-meaning Avon lady (Diane Wiest) finds him living alone in his crumbling castle, and brings him home to live with her family, which includes daughter Kim (Winona Ryder). Edward is naive and timid, but so sweet and helpful that he soon becomes the darling of the neighborhood. He is smitten with  Kim, which angers her bully of a boyfriend (Anthony Michael Hall).

Diane Wiest is perfect as the ditsy and always-cheerful mom. Ryder is convincing as a selfish and spoiled teen.  Hall is the villian you love to hate.  The star, of course, is Johnny Depp. As Edward, he is painfully shy and lovelorn; his performance is so heart-wrenchingly delicate that you ache for him in every scene. Covered with white make-up and with only a few words of dialogue, Depp proves he is a very talented actor. The wonderful and quite frail Vincent Price, as Edward's loving creator, will surely bring a tear to your eye.

This completely unique film blends comedy, fantasy, and romance to make a sentimental fairy tale that both teens and adults will enjoy. It is a heart-breaker; bring your hankie.

1187833,4,B000005QLO,"Yes, that's right. Tim Burton is twisted. But in an incredibly delightful way. And Edward Scissorhands proves that. Who else could take a story about a boy who was created with scissors for hands who is taken by an Avon lady away from his lonely home to live with her and her family? Just the ""Avon lady"" part is wonderful enough to make this movie premise crazy, but Burton did it. And did it well.

 Tim Burton's direction of Edward Scissorhands places a world of loneliness and darkness into a world of brightness and ""cheer"" in a cliched (oh so cliche) replica of a suburban neighborhood. The combination of Edward's dark demeanor (it's almost as if he belongs in an actual black and white movie) with the colors of the houses and cars and outfits of the suburban people was wonderful and appreciative to the story.

 Johnny Deep proved long before any of his other movies that he is an excellent character actor. His portrayal of Edward was subtle yet very touching. Diane Weist was - I want to say cute - as the quirky suburban mom who naively takes in Edward to join her family. Her chemistry with Johnny Depp was wonderful. Depp's chemistry with Winona Ryder was also great. Although they share only the ending of the movie the most together, it's awesome. The ice sculpting scene is one for the books, and that one line - ""Hold me."" And Vincent Price's last performance is found here.

 I definately have to note Danny Elfman's score. In my most recent viewing of the film, it played a big part in almost each scene, and was orchastrated beautifully.

 The DVD's transfer is great, but not too great as to enjoy that 90s feel of the movie. The supplements satisfied this fanboy. Edward Scissorhands won a place in movie history, and in my list of movies to love forever.",1095724800,4,1779,4.572327044025157

1187836,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton could never be accused of pandering to Hollywood studios by producing bland, mainstream, blockbuster films. He is known for his quirky, weird and individual style of film making. Edward Scissorhands is a typical Burton film in its originality and is probably one of the best he has made to date.

The story centres around Edward, an isolated, shy and socially naive young man who was created by a scientist (Vincent Price). Unfortunately his maker dies before he has completed him and so Edward is left with scissors for hands. For years he lives alone in an old house on top of a hill. Edward's isolation is interrupted by the local Avon lady (Dianne Weiss) who decides he needs to be taken under her wing and promptly moves him into her home and attempts to integrate him into the local community.

Initially all goes well as his 'novelty' appeals to the locals who flock round to have their hair cut or hedges made into fantastic shapes by the wonderfully artistic Edward. As the film progresses however, things turn ugly as the locals turn against this all too different young man. Burton takes a magnificent swipe at middle class suburban America in his portrayal of the neighbourhood (identical houses, cars etc.)where everyone acts the same in an effort to belong and anything new or different is rejected.

Edward is brilliantly portrayed by Johnny Depp who demonstrates a tremendous ability to show his thoughts and emotions without speaking. His confusion and hurt at what is happening around him are so palpable and his doomed love for the daughter of the house (Winona Ryder)is heartbreaking.

This film is a magical fairytale for adults and will make you laugh and cry in equal amounts. Highly recommended.",1093392000,3,1730,4.8941979522184305

I can never get enough of this movie. Its a great Christmas movie, telling you how snow was made, but it also is a great all around movie, perfect for families, except for one scene and a few bad words.

Johny Depp made the most powerful artistic performance about a unknown and never created before character . Heaccepted the role and won by far .

Also, Johnny Depp did a GREAT job acting.  He doesn't have many lines, but his facial expressions are...I don't know how to describe them.

1187866,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton's films are arguably the 20th/21st century answer to Grimm's fairy tales.  Each of his films are at once entertaining, mesmerizing and thought provoking, giving the viewer an askewed but vivid portrayal of life through the images he so masterfully captures.
Edward Scissorhands is a prime example of such a film.
It is the story of an inventor and his invention, a ""Pinocchio"" fable if you will, about a man who creates life though his craft, though in this instance, the inventor (Vincent Price), dies before he can complete his invention; namely, Edward (Johnny Depp), a man built from the pieces/parts of the inventors many fancy machines.  Instead of being whole, Edward is left with menacing ""scissor-hands"".
Peg Boggs (Diane Wiest), an AVON saleswoman, ventures to the home of the inventor after failing to sell any of her wares too her usual customers, the housewives of her small community.  When there, she discovers an enchanted old mansion, with beautiful sculptures cut from the tress and bushes that adorn the gardens.  Braving the dark of the immense home, she seeks out its owner, discovering Edward in the process.  When she sees that he is there alone, stricken with the ""infirmaty"" of his condition, she befriends him and takes him home with her.
The neighborhood women, nosey-busy bodies, catch wind of Peg's discovery, and it isn't long before Edward is the gossip of the day.  Edward, dark and mysterious, is a stark contrast to the bright, vibrant, colorful ""cookie-cutter"" neighborhood of pastel homes and yards, and the families that occupy them.  It isn't long before the neighborhood gossips, led by Joyce Monroe (Kathy Baker) invite themselves over for a cookout, and begin to exploit Edward for his many talents, including his gardening abilities and his inane talent to provide the women with elaborate hair-cuts.
The story advances when Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) returns home from a weekend camping trip.  He is at once taken with her, though she is repulsed by his differences, his outward deformity.  Unlike the others who immediately embrace him, she is repulsed by him.
And it is here where the story really unfolds.  Burton, whose films might be considered bizarre and cartoonish at the front, makes a couple of very poignant points about acceptance and love in this film.  Edward and Kim, through a series of events, are drawn together, and Kim learns that Edward's beauty is an internal one, and that, despite any physical abnormalities, he is far more beautiful than anyone she knows, save maybe for Peg, who defends Edward when the neighborhood turns on him later in the film.
Tim Burton's casting, direction and cinematic flare are never more poignant than they are in this film.  If a director has a signature piece, than Edward Scissorhands is Burton's, and it shows. Audiences will be touched by the tender performance Johnny Depp, whose portrayal of Edward is both moving and completly believable, a task that must have been doubly challenging considering the amount of prosthetics and make-up he underwent to get into character during each day of filming.
This film is a must have for any Burton fan, and a good film for the whole family.  Though there are moments in the film that might be slightly inappropriate for younger audiences, the film as a whole is a tender and touching love story and a story of acceptance despite diversity.
Danny Elfman, whose scores have become synonymous with some of the most popular television and film programs ever (The Simpsons, Tales from the Crypt, Batman), scores this film beautifully, and his soundtrack is haunting and tender.  The acting in the film is first rate, with an array of first rate actors (including those listed above): Alan Arkin and Anthony Michael Hall round out the cast.
Though the DVD does not offer as many extras as some films released in this format, it does provide the widescreen edition of this film, along with a director's commentary on the film, which provides many insightful glimpses into how the film was produced.  The film itself is digitally mastered, giving the sound and color a brilliance even more vibrant than provided in the theater.
This is a must have for any DVD library and a great film for all ages.  It is a film that, once seen, will be watched over and over again.

1187868,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton was born in 1958 & raised in the suburban city of Burbank California. Burton was a recluse & very shy.  He loved to draw and actually had a sketch of the little boy with the scissors for hands, now, Edward Scissorhands DECADES before his character became a feature film.
The character of Edward is uncannily, MUCH like Tim Burton.  The wild, black hair, the lonliness, reclusiveness, not really ""fitting in""... That, plus the 1950's & 60's portrayal of the suburbanite homes and nuclear families in the picture and you can see why this particular Burton film makes you feel just a bit more wonderful, sick & sad all at the same time for the world and the people that live in it.
Incidentally, Vincent Price cast as the doctor (in one of his last roles of his long, successful career) is Tim Burton's lifelong IDOL.

The town portrayed in the movie is a caricature of the appalling normalcy that, it seems, is the only acceptable way for things to be. And then there's Edward Scissorhands - not even a man, yet more human than actual people. Someone who can only appreciate inner and outer beauty, not ""right"" or ""wrong""; someone who sees beauty in the unusual, the one thing that humankind hates so much.
A movie about how people see others as mere pieces in a grand game of chess; everyone has a certain position and is treated according to their position. Beauty? Fascination? Just masks and more masks to conceal that they've never felt anything they didn't intend to feel, never thought anything they didn't intend to think. There's no ""themselves"" behind the masks.

The situations he's put in are sometimes sad, most of the time funny though, see that's what also is good about this movie, lots of comic relief, so it isn't nothing but sad sad sad, it's also just a beautiful movie, the music is so amazing, and the character's are beautiful (not literally, i mean... they were all just the perfect fit for the movie.)

It`s not very surprising once it shows its main premise, showcasing the innocent and naive outsider entering a new and ""beautiful"" world. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is just another movie about an outcast who doesn`t quite know how to connect because he`s ""different"". Director Tim Burton presents a captivating and well-crafted atmosphere here, surreal, oniric and gloomy enough to catch one`s attention. Johnny Depp provides a solid performance as the fragile and curious protagonist, and the rest of the cast is good as well. Overall, this is a poignant and absorbing offbeat effort, one that proves Tim Burton`s uniqueness and creativity.

The neighborhood is very nosey and Peg has neighbors like a VERY religious woman and a whore...

1187888,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton brings to life a rare combination of elements that create a wonderfully poignant story that brings tears to my eyes every time I watch it.  On the surface the story is the tale of Edward Scissorhands, created by inventor Vincent Price in one of his greatest roles.  ""Edward Scissorhands"" could have been another story completely, a horror story, or science fiction, or a comedy.  Instead, Tim Burton creates a beautiful fairy tale set in an idealized suburbia of the 50s.
Edward has lived in a Gothic house that is intended to evoke Frankenstein's castle since his creator died.  Edward's house sits perched above a stereotypical suburban neighborhood, and one day the local Avon lady, Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest), comes calling.  Peg gets Edward to come home with her, where he immediately becomes the darling of the neighborhood's housewives, and the bane of all the neighborhood men, because of his skill with topiary and hair styling.
Of course the manly men of suburbia are not going to put up with the women of suburbia heaping their affections on Edward, and soon tensions begin to arise.  Eventually Kim Boggs (Winona Ryder) boyfriend Jim (Anthony Michael Hall) comes to blows with Edward, leading to a gorgeously sad and beautiful ending that clinches the fairy tale theme.
""Edward Scissorhands"" plays on so many levels.  As the alien outsider Edward is confused by the rituals of suburbia, which director Tim Burton has taken to excess to ultimately highlight the hypocrisy and paranoia of suburbia in a unique way.  At first Tim Burton indicates that his suburban neighborhood is perfect and the epitome of the ""middle class way.""  Once the illusion is established, Tim has the women attracted, yet repulsed by their own attraction, to the less-than-perfect Edward.  There comes a point where the women of the neighborhood want Edward, but since they can not truly possess Edward, they join in helping to cast him out.  Jim becomes the tool that allows the women of the neighborhood to do what they can not, cast him from their midst.
In the midst of the irony, Edward and Kim Boggs develop an innocent and beautiful love for each other.  Edward represents innocence, beauty, and perhaps the potential we all have.  Kim sees all this, and wants it, and her decision becomes the ironic capstone of this story.
Tim Burton has created a tale with an ending that causes my eyes to water every time I see it, in spite of the many times I've watched this movie.  I suspect it always will.  The contrast between the world as we think it should be, and the world as it could be, will always provide fodder for our art.  In this case Tim took that fodder and created cinematic and emotional gold.",1079654400,4,2706,4.799568965517241
1187889,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands is one of my favourite movies. Johnny Depp gives a brilliant performance as the vulnerable Edward. His facial expressions are so cute and heart wrenching that you just want to go up and give him a great big hug! The other actors do a great performance as well, and what can I say about Tim Burton? The guy is an imaginative genius!
This movie manages to be very comedic. Not exactly Im-gonna-pee-my-pants funny, but its the little quirky things that make you giggle. Edward Scissorhands is very touching as well, and you really feel strongly for Edward.

It is really not just about the deep wonderful character that Johnny Depp plays but also about humankind and our inability to accept differentness and individuallity.  At least that is what it struck me as.  Everyone is just so mean to Edward.  The PG-13 rating should be ignored but certain things should be fast forwarded over.

Also, for all the people out there who thought that it was ""dark and gloomy meets the Brady Bunch"", its called ""symbolism"". The modern, everyday, happy suberban meets the abandoned artificial man...who brings curiousity and in a way ""adventure"" to the town. Its supposed to be HAPPY LITTLE TOWN versus DARK AND GLOOMY, due to the fact Burton was trying to bring out real messages through unlikely situations. The first time I saw this movie I was about six years old, and since then i thought this was an incredible film. True, the special featueres on the DVD are not somthing to die for, but I am not judging that. i am judging the quality of the story, which in my opinion was MAGNIFICENT!

1187893,5,B000005QLO,"Tim Burton is definitely the most inventive director out there, and I have gone back to watching his older movies again after seeing the incredible ""Big Fish"". ""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of my all-time favorites of Burton's, because it is such a strange story created into a modern fairy tale, with his usual cleverness. Johnny Depp is great here as Edward, the odd man built by the now deceased Inventor, who, obviously, has scissors for hands because he was not yet complete when his creator died. He is brought into the typical suburban neighborhood by an overzealous Avon lady, and he is forced into a real life there with her family and oddball neighbors. At first Edward is accepted and revered for his differences, but things inevitably go sour, and this movie is a tale of acceptance and understanding of one another. And Burton is smart about this. He does not force this theme down our throats, but allows us to feel the grief of Edward ourselves. We really care for this character, because he is special, and he is different. Winona Ryder is also good here, and Alan Arkin is amazing as the often dazed and confused father of the family Edward lives with.
Burton really captures our imagination with his gothic world of surrealism, making us believe that this could have actually transpired somewhere, sometime. Or a story just like it.
This movie is excellent. It is funny, sad, heart-warming and romantic all at the same time, and it should be cherished as the classic that it is.
I do wish that more effort was put into the DVD, because this is the 10th Anniversary edition of this movie. There is only a small featurette and the origianl trailers, but nothing much else. I would have liked to see them do interviews with the cast and crew now, ten years after this remarkable film was released.",1076112000,2,1811,4.69811320754717

He assembles a fine cast, which is what really makes this movie work with their razor sharp performances.  They play beautifully off the ridiculous theme he creates. Part Pinnochio, part Frankenstein, Edward Scissorhands seems an Andy Warhol-inspired creation, played impeccably by Johnny Depp who is virtually unrecognizable in the role.  The sad-faced boy, as my little daughter calls him, descends upon the suburb below (thanks to the Avon lady) and soon turns it on its head.  Kathy Bates, at her vampy best, quickly seizes on this prized new object of affection, but it is Winona Ryder who steals his heart.  The movie's strength is in the personal relationships it sets up.  The action is a bit weak-kneed and doesn't resolve itself very well.  I was surprised to find that my 3-year old daughter loves the movie, I think in large part to the compelling nature of Scissorhands himself who is one of the most memorable movie creations of all time.",1075852800,4,1105,4.940540540540541

While the film is visually stunning and worth seeing just for the scenery, it's really Johnny Depp's performance and Danny Elfman's amazing score that grab you and don't let go. Add a lovely young Winona Ryder and a host of hilarious supporting characters, and you have a modern fairy tale classic (akin to The Princess Bride) that I find myself watching over and over again.

The pastel stereotype Suburbia is so interesting, the characters are complete stereotypes and yet they are all unique.  All of them immediately accept Edward and don't seem phased by his deformity.  Kim is the only one who really reacts to him.  I expected the classic beauty and the beast story but it seemed completely opposite.  The visual aspects and the music blend together perfectly, I think this is Tim Burton's best film (and also probably my favorite Depp movie as well, though I've seen Benny & Joon a thousand times and love it to death so it's hard to tell).  I really don't think any movie can match the music of the Nightmare Before Christmas on Danny Elfman's part, but this comes close, especially for a less muscial movie.

Overall, this movie is magical.  It's something you can watch again and again.  The characters are interesting and Depp's performance is beautiful.  One thing to keep in mind if you haven't seen it is tha this is not a dark movie.

Johnny Depp (who is simply fantastic in this great film) plays Edward, the lonely, caring, and artistic man(depending on opinion) who is found by an Avon lady one day in his dark, gloomy home. She brings him to her warm, colourful neighbourhood and integrates him with the family. As a viewer, you'll hope that Edward lives happily but with his scissor like hands, the likelyhood of him being 'normal' is slim. Is he accepted? Does he find love? These questions can only be answered when you watch this film.
The film unravels itself to be a great piece of cinematic work as it uses bright colours and characters to portray the environment that Edward is living in.
The film counts on the actor who is playing Edward to deliver a magnificent performance and Johnny Depp just does that. I can't imagine anyone else playing him. He is more than just looks, he has undeniable talent and if you have doubted him before, you'll change your mind when you watch this film.

Things that would be absurd in other types of films (What is such an out of place castle doing looming over a hilariously cliche suburb?  Why aren't people as utterly terrified of him as they would be in real life?) instead help to transport you to this world where such innocence, such a pure desire to simply love and be loved, can be embodied in one beautiful young man.

1187940,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands is a masterful piece of work. The screenplay itself was pretty well-written, but Burton did a perfect job in directing the world and Danny Elman composed a musical score that is a wondrous work of art on its own and lends a beautiful touch to the film. The actors seem to have been made for the roles they inhabit, creating one of my favorite movies of all time.
Edward is a creation of an old inventor who lived in a castle on a hill. However, he died before he could complete Edward, leaving him with scissors for hands. Edward lives alone up there until Peg comes calling as the Avon lady and takes Edward home. Edward is first loved by the neighborhood, then despised, then hated. He wins the heart of Peg's daughter, but earns the ire of her slimeball boyfriend.
Burton does an excellent job in showing the contrast between Edward's dark world and the bright pastel suburbia. He keeps the pacing going at all the right moments. He knows exactly which parts are funny, moving, and saddening, and he portrays them perfectly. Johnny Depp, known for his acting in kooky roles, plays the childlike innocence of Edward to the letter, and the other actors do a great job of playing their own unique personalities. Danny Elfman's musical score sets the mood for each scene and compliments the film beautifully. I don't know how many awards he may have recieved for the score, but I know he doesn't have enough of them.
On the whole, this movie will make you laugh, cry, and most of all, feel. It sets a perfect stage for showing how poor, innocent Edward cannot fit in a society that preys on innocence. A man untainted by the world cannot survive in the world. The colorful suburban neighborhood seems like the American Dream, but this movie masterfully shows the corruptness of it's denizens and the dark rivers of ignorance that flow beneath it. The residents should know better, but they choose not to. The love story is actually believable and the ending will make you cry, regardless of how big or tough a guy you may be. This film is definately worth owning. This is a great film, and it's a shame Hollywood can't make more like this.",1065052800,2,2158,4.607792207792208

The inventor passes away suddenly one day, before Edward could be finished and so Edward is remained with hands of sharp shears.
One day, an Avon lady, Peg, finds him in the castle where he was all alone, and so takes him back to her home in Suburbia.  There, he is welcomed by the townpeople as he did their gardening (made wonderful figures from the trees) cut their dogs' hair and the people's hair.
However, Peg's daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder), was the only one who found him odd and scary at first. Edward,however, fell in love with her the first moment he saw her picture.  When Edward appeared on a television show and got shocked when he accidently cut the microphone wires, it was the first time she appeared concerned for him.  Her boyfriend, Jim, seemed like an obnoxious jerk when he laughed at the situation.  After Edward helped her, Jim, and other friends break into Jim's place and was the only one who got caught and took all the blame, she started to have feelings for him. He would have done anything for her, for when she asked him if he knew it was Jim's place, and he said yes, and then asked why he did it then..he replied, because she asked him to...
With the break in event, saving Kevin (Kim's bro), from almost being hit by a van but accidently cutting him with his scissorhands in the process, made the townpeople feel threatened by him..
Kim tells him to run away when police sirens were heard, and so he runs back to the castle. Kim follows him and also her now jealous ex-boyfriend, Jim, who thinks he lost her to a non human thing..(since he saw her before dancing in the snow that Edward made when making an angel out of a huge block of ice)..
A fight ensues and Jim is killed and Kim tells Edward that she loves him..and it's the last time they see each other...
The old lady, from the beginning is actually Kim, and so says that before Edward came, it never snowed, and after, it did...

It's hard enough for Edward to adapt to the real world without living in a neighborhood of nosy women and Peg {the Avon woman]'s beautiful daughter Kim.  Of course, Edward goes from celebrity to being feared in about three seconds and back and forth. But there are so manys scenes that shouldn't be beautiful that are.

You're the closest to heaven that I'll ever be
And I don't want to go home right now.""
--""Iris"", from the City of Angels soundtrack
In Edward Scissorhands, Tim Burton delivers a devastating slam against a conformist, superficial society, and even as we might snicker at the vacuous, gabbing neighbors, this movie forces us to ask some difficult questions about ourselves.  ""Don't ever let anyone tell you that you have a handicap,"" one of those neighbors tells Edward towards the beginning of the movie.  In the end, however, the acceptance turns out to be all show and no substance.  How often do we give lip service to tolerance, but hold bigotry in our hearts?  Only one character, Kim, succeeds in (literally) embracing difference.
The world of ""suburbia"" is just as devoid of life as the ""desert of the real"" seen in The Matrix.  It may be painted in bright colors, but in the end, it is still a desert.  Although all the characters in this movie are caricatures, it's a great irony (and masterstroke on the part of Mr. Burton) that the most unusual-looking character is in fact the most real in a different sense.  It is poor, confused Edward with whom the viewer can truly make a connection.  Marooned among empty shells of people, this artificially-constructed boy seems at times to be the only one who genuinely has *soul*.
Johnny Depp does a mindblowing job of bringing Edward to life, perhaps even injecting something of himself into the shy, awkward artist, if his rather nervous conduct in the ""Sound Bites"" section is any indication.  The greatest part of his acting is nonverbal, far beyond the few words he softly speaks.  For instance, it was clear to me that Mr. Depp had studied the movements and facial expressions of virtuoso artists who are in their element.  In the scene where Edward begins giving haircuts, he reminded me of a soulful concert pianist, in how his surprisingly gentle movements were each charged with emotion.  Another interesting nonverbal aspect--and one that may even cause the viewer to misinterpret Edward for a moment, just as the neighbors do, is the way he nervously twitches the blades of his ""hands"" at times.  Although it can appear threatening, once you look in his eyes it's clear he's simply fidgeting in the same way as one might tap their fingers on the table.
But to me (besides the touching scene where embraces Kim), one of the most poignant moments was when Edward flinched away from the Avon lady's touch, when one would *think* that of the two characters, he was the least threatened.  In the end, Edward seems to have had the correct measure of the situation.  It is tragic that his exposure to ""what we call reality"" resulted in such great pain to Edward and Kim.  Although the court psychiatrist comments that Edward's grasp on reality is tenuous, I came away thinking that only Edward and Kim were in touch with the substance behind the illusion everyone else confused for ""real"".
""And I don't want the world to see me
'Cause I don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who I am.""

1187971,5,B000005QLO,"I have a friend who is convinced that `Edward Scissorhands' is a metaphor about the way the media treats celebrities. My mother says that Edward represents anyone who can be considered ""different"". A lot of people think that the point of the movie is to display the way people will love something one second and hate it the next. I had a teacher once who told me it was about what it's liked to be loved for the things you do but hated as a person. My six-year-old cousin thinks it's about how sad it would be to have scissors for hands.
 I honestly have no idea what Tim Burton's masterpiece of a movie is ""really"" about. It seems to me that it is very open to interpretation, as there is no real basis to say that any of these ideas are just plain wrong (Can you really say that my cousin's observation that it would be sad to have scissors for hands is way off base?); however none of them really feels right to me.
 Here is what I have to say about Edward Scissorhands: This movie makes me sob; I mean I just bawl my eyes out every time I watch it. Only God knows why, but for some reason there is nothing sadder than a monstrous looking loner who is misunderstood and taken advantage of. I know it sounds like a specific description, but the idea is just so universally poignant that details and all it has been done numerous times (the most notable being Gaston Leroux's ` The Phantom of the Opera' and of course `Beauty and The Beast').
 Then there's the whole other story of Johnny Depp's performance. There are a lot of actors who are considered ""good actors"" but we never really think about what their limitations are because we only see them in roles that they can play well (which, of course, would be the reason they're playing them). I am fairly confident that not a lot of actors could have successfully played the part of Edward, so when you consider how successfully Depp did play it that says something. One of the interesting things about the movie is that its title character has what seems like two lines in the whole thing, which made Depp's job of doing a decent job even harder - he never has a weak moment, not once.
 I do not know what Edward Scissorhands is a metaphor for; however, I do know that this movie successfully makes people feel, whatever it is that they feel when watching it, more than any other movie I know of. It is surprising but telling that a movie that seems so strange could succeed in making so many different people care about the same thing: the fate of a lonely misfit who somehow comes across as far less fictional than it seems that such an obviously imagined creature should. Therefore provoking the question: exactly how much of this ""fantasy movie"" is truly fiction?",1059004800,17,2723,4.418326693227091

When Edward moves in, he is simply trying to fit in with the rest of society.  This relates to the writings of Edgar Allen Poe and Nathaniel Hawthorne.  It talks about a nonconformist trying to fit in with a conformist society, as well as lost love and anger.  The main problem with the movie was how the ending went.  It lacks a general idea why Edward is like what he is today as well as a good explanation why Edward doesn't come back to the town anymore.

In fact, I have never cried harder during a movie.

Tim Burton, the best director ever, (look for his other films) creates the perfect cast, setting, and plot in this movie. The soundtrack by Danny Elfman,( look for the soundtrack) creates the most beautiful music ever in a movie. You can hear the drama and comedy flowing through the music.

1187976,5,B000005QLO,"1990: Tim Burton's introverted film is touching and tragic. The music by Danny Elfman is appropriately haunting and the acting is  even Oscar worthy. Tim Burton's most personal film, Edward Scissorhands is an extension of the director himself and his feelings of alienation from society, his not fitting in, as we have all felt or feel many times as people governed by a regulated society, a society of people who are biased and judge others before getting to know their soulful humanity. Edward Scissorhands is a great commentary on outsiders, foreigners and people who are not mainstream- it can be applied to different cultures and races, people of different sexual orientation and people of different religious faiths.
Edward is the invention of an eccentric, lonely scientist (played by Vincent Price) who lives in a Gothic castle which looms on a great hill over a small, suburban 50's idealistic town. Peg (Diane Weiston) is the local Avon lady, who is married with a husband and kids (her daughter Kim is played by Winona Ryder). She sells her cosmetic products to bored housewives that live in pastel houses whose husbands go to work in a synchronized order. She meets Edward Scisshorhands and takes him in as her house guest. He begins to win people's affections at first, especially because he has great talent with his scissor, especially making lawn statuary and great haircuts.
But eventually, when Edward falls for Peg's daughter Kim, the town turns against him, not wanting to welcome this still very strange man. The modern fairty tale is moving, appropriately scored by Danny Elfman's chilling, haunting and romantic style of composition. This film is worth watching and worthy even of some Oscars. I don't recall whether it won anything. That year, Silence Of The Lambs or Misery won the Best Picture.",1049241600,3,1820,5.026490066225166

(She also wrote the script for ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and is, I'm convinced, responsible for the better jokes in ""Addams Family I"") So many reviews here mention ""the story""...without a script there would have been no story to film.

  Although parts of the movie tend to go unexplained(in the Ice Dance scene,where did Edward get the big block of ice??), the pure creativity makes up for them ten times over.
  Symbolism reigns. Watch for hearts and cookies;they play a huge role in the story and pop up again and again. Also, the contrasts between what is arguably the world's most perfect neighborhood and the castle and Edward are dramatic, and highlight the character's desire(and failure) to belong in a colorful world of happiness and heartache.",1046476800,,760,5.007936507936508
1187979,5,B000005QLO,"""Edward Scissorhands"" was the Inventor's (Vincent Price) last experiment he didn't get to finish. As an outcast living in a gigantic castle above a 1950's suburb, Edward met a woman named Peg (Dianne Wiest). This overly kind Avon lady brought him down to her home to enrich his complexion and get rid of his ghastly scars that covered his pale face. He had scissors as hands and that brought plenty of attention from the local housewives. A religious woman thought that the devil had summoned a demon to walk among them (poor Edward). But the others discovered a raw talent in him after he had cut some shrubbery in Peg's backyard. His artistic flair sprouted as he cut women's hair, dog hair and constructed ice sculptures. Fame called his name as he appeared on a television show and a barbershop would open just for him. Peg's daughter Kim (Winona Ryder) had fallen in love with the isolated ""man,"" but they could never be together for society had turned against him. He had been framed for breaking and entering into Kim's sadistic boyfriend's house. Years had passed after the psycho boyfriend was murdered and Edward was in seclusion once again, but still sculpting Kim's angelic features with his hands. This is a magical fairy tale movie that will leave anyone crying for weeks. Kleenex boxes never ran out so fast. It'll feel like a flash flood had run amok in your house.

1188000,2,B000005QLO,"Here is a review that lends credence to viewer/reader theory.  The first time I saw Edward Scissorhands, I saw it as an allegory.  Viewed within this framework, it is a film with nothing but the clichs of the Hollywood far-left worldview: the misunderstood, outcast artist unable to communicate to the world except through his art; the ultra-Brady Bunch peasantry to whom the artist tries to communicate; the nearly insane religious element.  As an allegory, it was really pathetic stuff: one star.
The second time I watched it, years later, I saw it as satire.  Could Burton be witty enough to parody the Hollywood elite this way?  Does he recognize and lampoon the anti-religious bigotry so prevalent among his colleagues?  Are those who don't see it really the numb-brains who live in the pastel-colored rubber-stamp suburb?  Viewing Burton's creation from this framework significantly improved the picture - three stars.
I give the film the mean of the two scores.",1045526400,31,968,5.0886075949367084

1188004,4,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands is the archetypical tale of transformation, and of the transforming power of love. A ""mechanized"" young man has scissors for hands because his inventor (played by the late Vincent Price) dies before he is able to complete his work.  Subsequently he lives over an extended period of time in the darkness and isolation of the castle in which he was created, until one day a kind woman from the suburban community below visits in the hope of finding new clients for her Avon business. Struck by his isolation and unkempt appearance, she takes him  home to her family in an effort to care for him. The adventure begins. The young man discovers he has the capacity for love as well as the hate love can generate. His love for the woman's beautiful teen daughter, Kim, flowers. As their love painfully progresses, they mature, she from a somewhat self-centered girl into a caring young adult, and he from an underdeveloped  inexperienced humanoid into a more mature, caring creature. The viewers discover that his incompleteness resides not in his hands but in his heart. This, however, is remedied through Kim. The transforming power of the love he has for Kim manifests itself in his art, in the explosive beauty of his ice sculptures, and the attending snow flakes he produces as he carves the forms he cares for. Kim, for her part, is transformed into an elegant ballerina as she dances thru the falling snow. In the end, the suburban community rejects his presence, primarily because he cannot be formed into its image. He flees back to the castle where he is destined to remain from then on. His return to the castle can be seen as less of a retreat than as an acceptance of his place in the scheme of things, evidence of his transformation. The castle then becomes a place not of isolation, but a place where his physical limitations are transformed into gifts, where he continues generating his sculptures while showering the community below with snow.  The love between Kim and him is sustained in a timeless manner as is revealed at the beginning and end of the tale. In the final analysis, Edward becomes more human than many of his human counterparts in the community . If anything is incomplete, it is this: this wonderful tale demands a sequel where Kim's granddaughter, introduced at the beginning of the film, matures into her 30s and becomes a New York CEO. Her rising career is suddenly  interrupted one day after glimpsing a small newspaper clip on the back page of the local paper reporting that  snows have stopped falling in her hometown. In defiance of her scepticism and disillusionment over her hometown's narrowmindedness and gossipy proclivities,  one of the reasons for her departure to New York, she returns to seek Edward in the castle, seeking the truth of his existence and should he exist, to help him if she can. She fears that if he does exist, he might be breaking down. She wishes to confirm to him her deceased grandmother's love for him, as revealed in a secret diary.  She finds him somewhat rusted and immobile, in a dark corner. They become friends. He questions her about death, and whether or not he has a soul. She replies that she doesn't know, but that if he does, she is sure he will see Kim again.  The granddaughter attempts to save him from breakdown by secretly calling in a robotics expert. Unfortunately, he cannot help because Edward's inventor left incomplete records of his work. In the end, Edward asks for one thing, to be given hands. The expert in an attempt to be of some help succeeds in this endeavor. Edward soon thereafter stops functioning. They place him in a box which they bury in  the garden grounds. Some days later, on Christmas day, the granddaughter decides to return to her busy corporate life in New York, but as she departs her parent's home to catch the taxi for the evening flight , it begins to snow. Moved to tears, she begins to dance as her grandmother once did. She immediately decides to quite her job, to remain and convert the castle overlooking the community into an art museum in memory of her Grandmother and Edward. Story ends. P.S.  Johnny Depp must return to play this last role.",1040688000,,4187,4.714090287277702
1188005,5,B000005QLO,"I've known about ""Edward Scissorhands"" for as long as I can remember (I was an infant when it came out) but I never had any interest in seeing it. Then last week, I was watching the FOX special, ""Greatest Christmas moments of all time"" and they included some parts from this film. I realized that I really HAD to see it! The only knowledge I had of it was my mom telling me that when my older brother saw it in the theatres, he came out very quiet. When she asked him how it was, he just said, ""It was sad"".
 As soon as the movie started, I was a little hesitant. There showed an old woman tucking her granddaughter into bed. The granddaughter points out that it's snowing outside, and asks why. I believe they live in California. The old woman replies it's because of a man named Edward. Somehow I could already tell it would be very sad. She continues, saying that long ago there was a scientist who tried to create a person. Very much like Frankenstein, I guess. The person he named Edward and he had sharp shears for temporary hands. But when the scientist dies suddenly, Edward is left alone, still having the strange scissorhands.
 Thus continues the story. It cuts to an Avon saleswoman walking up to a pastel house to try to sell make-up. After having no luck, she decides to try and make a sale at the big gloomy mansion at the top of a mountain, where Edward lives of course. Though she is frightened by Edward at first, she soon realizes that he is very innocent and shy. And she takes him home with her.
 The rest of the movie is what happens when Edward meets Suburbia in the early 60's. This includes waterbeds, dogs, nosy neighbors, jealous boys, and the teenage daughter (Winona Ryder) of the woman that took him in. Edward himself is a very sweet character. He's just so innocent, but he's not by any means stupid. He can talk, though he hardly ever chooses to. Johnny Depp does a wonderful job as playing him. In one part of the movie, Winona's character whispers to Edward whom she loves, ""Hold me"". He trys to wrap the scissors around her without harming her, but answers very quietly and simply, ""I can't"". Just looking at the cover of ""Edward Scissorhands"" with that depressed look on his face makes me want to cry. The night after I first watched it (just last month), I sat up in my room thinking, ""Why couldn't they just give him hands?"" and then after thinking over some scenes in the movie, I thought just for a split second,  ""Wait, maybe I could go to that town. Edward would still be in his castle!"" and then remembered it was just a movie. There ISN'T an Edward. Edward is Johnny Depp in a wig and make-up. That castle isn't real either. But yet, I felt all of the character's emmotions so strongly! Especially Johnny Depp's with his awkward movements and odd appearance. This movie made me a big fan of his. Depp sheads all of his ""normalness"" and BECOMES Edward. He ""becomes"" all his roles, and I shudder to think what this movie would have become if Tom Cruise played Edward instead. They were actually considering him!
 This is film is a rare wonder. It has a few jokes, but it's mostly a drama. The acting is wonderful by everyone, especially Depp (as I said before) and Ryder. It's very sweet and touching. Tim Burton, like always, brings great directing and visual scenery to the movie. I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I reccomend it to people over 12 though, because it does have a dark mood to it. It's just astonishing and beautiful.",1040342400,4,3483,4.452978056426332

Edward Scissorhands is a must see for everyone. It was kind of hard to see Anthony Michael Hall as a villain but he does a great job from going from the geek in Sixteen Candles to the bully in Edward Scissorhands.

1188026,5,B000005QLO,"TO sum it up in a few words, I believe this is Burton's best film. And I think it's definitely one of Danny Elfman's best aswell. The score really MADE the movie. Seriously, without that special score, would the movie have been all that great? Maybe, but for sure not as touching. Tom Cruise was originally going to play Edward, and thank God he didn't because Johnny Depp captured it perfectly. The DVD is awesome, if only because of the Burton-Elfman commentary over the film, like they did in Peewee's Big Adventure. ( but i'm not sure if they did it seperatly or not).
SPECIAL FEATURES INCLUDE:
*Audio commentary by Tim Burton and Danny Elfman
*Concept Art ( Edward was an original drawing Burton had done way back in the Cal Arts days)
*Original Theatrical Trailer
*TV Spots
The Special features don't blow you away, but the movie should compensate for that. Danny Elfman is personally my favorite composer, and I'm happy that it all just came together for him and Burton alike. God bless, good tidings, and fairwell - Jeffro",1022112000,2,1030,4.696132596685083
1188027,5,B000005QLO,"...Edward was by NO means merely a caricature; his personality runs deep, and possibly even deeper than many of the ""socialized heroes"" out there... social hero, pff... I see Edward Scissorhands (the film as a whole) as an allegory as well as a satire, not just of Tim's personal life (maybe), but of everyone: Edward is an artist enveloped high up on his lonely ""mountain"" that is comprised of misunderstanding, his being ""different"", a pure view of the world, and the feelings that result from those things. Edward comes down, timid and awkward, in an attempt to experience this seeming beauty of colorful suburbia that only seems wonderful from afar (as edward soon finds out...)
""Even if he lived in a more hospitable world, however, it is hard to tell what satirical comment Edward would have to make, because the movie makes an abrupt switch in his character about two-thirds of the way through. Until then he's been a gentle, goofy soul, a quixotic outsider."" Sure Edward goes through a character change. It is not that abrupt though. He began as a gentle soul and left as a gentle soul; the difference was that he began the film reaching into suburbia with a longing for beauty, love, acceptance, and understanding. He dared to reach out of his high mountain and try for acceptance in this place that seemed so beautiful from afar. Unfortunately, along with the ideal love that he found, he also came to the realization that (to use the old adage) ""you can't judge a book by its cover""-- though the suburbians were accepting of this fearsome-looking (but gentle at heart) creature at first, their facade of compliance wore away fast as their true bitterness (jealousy maybe? unhappiness?) melted with edward's realization of particularly that. (there i go making sense again, ha )...
That is also where the satire lies. ES pokes fun at those who are living a lie-- their personalities run only skin-deep (or perhaps air deep, teehee), and underneath lies this ravaging monster who wants to tear innocence apart-- just look at the ""mob"" at the end running after edward- their hairdues suggest horns, of sorts, and they make edward, who looked outlandish at the beginning, look quite tame. And where does he end up? back on his mountain, being once again misunderstood by the shallow masses. but he is not alone; his bold and desperate reaching into communication brought back true love and acceptance, who here, we may call kim. His plight was worth something, and Tim gives the artist, who feels completely alone in his world of emotion and creativity, someone to hold on to, a glimmer of light to serve as his once source of happiness.
the SET, needless to say, and the music, exemplified the story and character of edward immaculately. Beautiful, graceful, empty at times, strange, and yet... fulfilling when looked at as a whole. Suburbia, on the other hand, when looked at as a whole, might as well be a pit of vipers (with the occasional mouse struggling to escape)... ummmmm yea anyway...
but
In a way, Edward is an everyman-- he has basic feelings, of which he experiences nearly every one ~love, anger, jealousy, bereavment, joy, distrust, loneliness, and completion (etc etc etc). Though these are everyday and seemingly simple emotions, they can run deeply, passionately, and beautifully through us, yet ultimately become either our downfall (in jim's case), or they can climax in an emotional whirlpool of happiness that serves as possibly the one moment you'd want to look back on in life, even after it is long gone and nearly forgotten...",1021075200,,3560,4.88595041322314

1188051,4,B000005QLO,"Welcome to Dullsville, USA. It is an early 1960's suburban community of cookie cutter houses (distinquished only by their colors) and postage stamp lawns. Husbands drive their vehicles to work leaving their wives to fantasize about having an affair and gossiping about one another.
  What a wonderful and safe community, that is until Edward comes in. He creates a sensation. He's male (great potential for sex), dresses funny and has an entirely different perspective. His only peculiarity is his hands. They are made up of sharp knives, scissors and other cutting implements. Who cares? After all what could possibly happen with him in this great town?
  Quite a bit! Edward Scissorhands is a marvellous comedy spoofing the lives and values of a myopic community. Diane Wiest does a great job in her role as the Avon lady who brings this weird ""monster"" into the community. Somehow the Avon lady misses seeing that Edward is different. Unlike the others in the town, she accepts him for who he is.
  Johnny Depp gives us a stellar preformance as Edward, the creative, quiet and reflective young ""creation"" who is slowly emerging from his years of isolation. His openess for change and need for acceptance will touch your heart. This video touches all of those weak spots in the community. We witness their hypocrasy, lack of meaningful lives, peer pressure and the inability to appreciate the gift that Edward brings to them.
  You will throughly enjoy this film which will touch your heart and make you reflect upon what are the true ""monsters' in our lives.  Are they the Edwards or ourselves? Find out in this splendid tale.",1014854400,,1629,4.916058394160584
1188052,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands is Tim Burton's classic modern fairy tale that features not only some of the director's best work, but a great cast (including Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Diane Weist, and Vincent Price), and a fantastic score by Danny Elfman.
The story revolves around the misadventures of Edward, a strange and lonely young man, created by an eccentric old inventor who lived in a dark mansion, high on a hill overlooking a twisted suburban ""Everytown, USA"".  We learn that Edward was left unfinished, having only scissors for hands, after the inventor dies unexpectedly, and leaving his creation to live a quiet and isloated life, far from the town below.  In a quirk of fate, he is eventually discovered by an over-zealous Avon Lady from town when she comes calling at the lonely mansion and decides to befriend Edward and take him back to live with her family.
Edward Scissorhands is a classic tale of fantasy and love, hope and sorrow.  Tim Burton gives us a truly caring and sympathetic character in Edward.  He is a kind, yet naive innocent who wants to help people and is often taken advantage of by the locals of the town, as well as duped and assaulted by the macho bully boyfriend of the girl he falls in love with.  In the end, Edward finds that he simply doesn't belong in the harsh reality of the real world and escapes back to the sanctuary of his mountain hideaway.  Burton also gives us a scathing and harshly warped view of suburban life, showcasing the shallow superficiality of 'The Burbs' with it's tacky identical cars, neon-colored houses, overdone lawns, bored businessmen and gaudy floral-print clad housewives.
Edward Scissorhands is a fun and entertaining film that I highly recommend.",1014163200,,1715,4.876288659793815
1188053,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands is quite simply the best fairy tale never told. This is Tim Burton in his eccentric prime, and his presence is palpable in every arena of this beautiful and personal film. The inventive art direction is perhaps the most memorable aspect of that presence, most notably in the pastel palette that covers everything from the ingenius solid-color costumes to the quaint neighborhood/town our characters inhabit.
The genius of this movie is more far-reaching than that. Everything fits seamlessly together--from Danny Elfman's quirky score to Stefan Czapsky's meticulous camera work to an entire cast full of nuanced performances... the list goes on and on. While this film's acting gem is Diane Weist in the role of the sweet and overly altruistic mother, Johnny Depp plays the titular role in a beautifully understated performance. Similarly, Winona Ryder wonderfully (and blondly) embodies young beauty and Alan Arkin turns in a comedic yet touching performance as the sometimes-overbearing father. The ensemble cast is flawless, complementing the quirky but ultimately realistic tone.
Perhaps the best aspect of this movie is that it achieves its goals with amazing subtlety--the overt themes of ""being different"", family, and (let's not forget) love are constantly driven into clich these days, but Edward Scissorhands accomplishes it all with a snip, not a stab.
This 10th Anniversary Edition DVD is everything this movie deserves--insightful commentaries from Tim Burton AND Danny Elfman and an interesting featurette, along with the concept art, trailers, TV Spots, and scene selection we've all come to expect. (The Interactive 3-D Menus are priceless!)

As a huge fan of Time Burton AND Johnny Depp, it is my completely unbiased opinion that this is (perhaps) one of the most underrated Christmas Love stories of modern times!!  But wait, you say, LOVE STORY??  How can that be??  Isn't this a Horror/Fantasy/Fairy Tale??
No Way!!  Edward Scissorhands is definitely a love story!!  It is the story of the love between a father and a son and a son and his father.  It is the tale of love between a boy and girl...the classic forbidden love as in Romeo and Juliet.  I can't believe it but I really must say that once again, I have to clap for Winona Ryder in this one (along with BeatleJuice).  Johnny Depp also provides great character development without speech.  And the dry humor is rampant throughout the film.  And the IRONY!!  Oh, the irony of it all.
The pastel suburbia, the Avon lady, waterbeds, and Chevy vans.  Topiary Gardens, sedans, and backyard BBQ's.  Even the story of why it now snows in the old home town.

The Making-of is one of the dullest I've seen on a DVD.  it takes the interview footage that I spoke of before, and inercuts it with scenes from the movie you just watched.  So that was bad also.

""Edward Scissorhands"" is an incredible take on the fairytale of a boy who just wants to fit in, who wants to have a life like others around him, and wants to find his true love to spend his life with. Johnny Depp shines as the fragile, yet uncompleted creation of The Inventor (Vincent Price). Edward can appear frightening to those who don't know him, fashioned like a monster from 1930s Hollywood cinema. But to those who get to know the real Edward, he is just as human as anyone else, gentle and wanting to share in the love of the world.
Tim Burton creates ""Edward Scissorhands"" in a funny, comically creative, yet very moving way. The closing scene between Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder is enough to bring anyone to tears.

Finally,this film was in general_looking interesting with the scenes of the grasses or the statue of the girl from ice, and can be enjoyed by both fantasy lovers and non_fantasy lovers alike.",977356800,15,694,4.650406504065041
1188105,5,B000005QLO,"""Edward Scissorhands"" is Tim Burton's masterpiece.  Beautiful, funny, sad, and enchanting.  What a remarkable film we have here.  I'm sure it needs no introduction or explaining-- if you haven't seen ""Edward Scissorhands"", go see it now!
The DVD is rather neat.  The menus are 3-D models of the inventor's castle and are very cool looking.  There are excellent commentary tracks from Burton and Danny Elfman (music composer) that are both entertaining and insightful.  There's a brief featurette that is somewhat intriguing.  There are also the trailers, and then TV-spots (two of them being from Spanish channels).  But what you'll cherish is the anamorphic widescreen, the Dolby Digital sound, and those commentary tracks.  If you're a Burton fan, you already have this.  If you aren't, buy this, and you soon too will discover the magic of Tim Burton and his best film.",977270400,2,872,5.120567375886525
1188106,3,B000005QLO,"In the beginning of the film, when Edward appears, I said myself ""How may I watch such a film?"" But as I watch a little more I noticed that this film was a really excellent film, which is full of psychology. It was about Edward, who is not a real human, I think. The mysterious old man in the old building probably produced him. After she brought him to her house the neighbors loved him. Also he loved everybody especially the young girl. Nevertheless I think these happened very fast. No adaptation could be seen. Only the girl was frightened when she saw him, but she loved him very fast, too. There was also comedy in the film. I think the scenes, which Edward was cutting the neighbors' hair, were only for fun. May be the scenarist wanted to find a reason for people to love him. The scene in which the friends of the girl make Edward a thief was very strong. But the dishonesty of the boys made the film more similar to the normal films, I think. But I am sure that the most electrifying scenes were the last scenes. I mean the scenes after Edward started to be angry. But it can also be said that it was too emotional. Finally I think the design was actually good. Since Johnny Depp was perfect it was impossible for this film to be wonderful. I can watch it several times.",977184000,9,1281,4.297520661157025
1188107,4,B000005QLO,"Normally, I am not concerned with films like this one. So when I first see the film, it looked very strange to me just at the beginning but,I can't stop myself to see the whole film.  It is a fantastic story about a man suffering from his scissorhands. In the society, when he does whatever people want, he is considered as a good,clever even a genious guy. His difference attract people. But,in fact people never adopt him as the way he is. They never mind his problems and his feelings. So when their pragmatic purposes come to an end they simply rejects him. In this period of time he falls in love. The whole story is set on a good atmosphere and also the music express the idea and emotion of the scenes very well. However, there are some awkwardly prepared scenes, for example the scene in which Edward saves the little boy from being hit by the car. Of course he doesn't want to hurt the boy but he does it because of his scissorhands. Here there is some exaggeration I think. He must not have used his hands very much in that case in order to convince the audience that he really does not want to hurt anybody.  Generally it is a very good film based upon a fantastic, amazing and fascinating story. The idea is excellent.",976752000,2,1230,4.366812227074236

1188110,5,B000005QLO,"""Edward Scissorhands"" stands as Burton's most sincere and striking films to date.  He goes far beyond the screen in this work however, into creating a mythic cycle for the youth cultures of 90's and on.  His focus on the outsider motif and archetype is extremely clear and vividly portrayed, set on a story that is at times both whimsical and filled with an existential fury.  Edward has become a powerful symbol in the minds of those youths lucky enough to view this film during the turbulent time of adolescence this film portrays.  Edward embarks on the accidental Hero's journey, down ""into the dark"" of middle class suburbia, and returns essentially beaten, but hardly defeated.  The story of Edward could be the story of Prometheus, if Prometheus had been a geek.
Overall this movie is like having Camu and the brothers Grim speak at the junior high.

Edward Scissorhands is a serious yet playful look at suburban living, and what can happen when a new factor arrives unannounced. Being 'rescured' from his decrepit mansion home by an overly helpful Avon lady, Peg Boggs, Edward is brought into their community. He quickly makes friends with all, through the amasing artwork in hedges and hair. All is not well, however, as Edward becomes nothing more than a symbol to the neighbors and ""friends"". He is used to bring the strange and unusual into their lives, and then tossed away like a used paper cup. Burton weaves this beautiful story next to Danny Elfman's musical score, possibly the best of his career, and the two are a perfect match. After an incident on Christmas Eve, Edward is chased back to his castle where Kim (who has in turn fallen in love with Edward) follows him... and so does Jim, with a gun. Edward and Jim scuffle, but when Jim hits Kim, Edward has had enough and throws him out of the window to his death. The brillant portrayal of Edward by Johnny Depp will soften even the most stony heart, as Depp conveys millions of emotions with few words.

1188114,5,B000005QLO,"A young girl, asking her grandmother why it snows on a winter's night. The grandmother's tale....of a castle on a hill, of the insane inventor who lived therein, and of the man he crafted but who was left unfinished when this inventor died. For years, Edward lived alone, in the castle atop a hill, until the day that society introduced itself to him in the form of a well-meaning and kindly hilarious Avon lady, who, seeing a cause in him, took him home to the strange and wonderful land of Suburbia. In Suburbia....the downward spiral that is often called a ""loss of innocence"" began for the fair Edward, for he is regarded merely as a novelty, something new to exploit, expend, screw, and use until he becomes no more a novelty and it is time to rid the town of this horrible threat. Isn't that the way it always goes, though? How true that this tale should be set in Suburbia; the birthplace of the consumer culture. But, as this film could not possibly end in such a bleak way, not with the magic of a new snowfall, the finish is sweet, and true, and even very sad. The score by Danny Elfman is one of, if not the, best he has ever done, and it too should be bought. Burton is a mad genius, we know that already, but the life and beauty he brings to this is impossibly heartbreaking, and the working chemistry betwen him and Depp is incredible - these two also teamed for ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Ed Wood"" - as is the chemistry between Depp and Ryder (which is, actually, very authentic - at the time these two were engaged - ). One interesting note is that this film makes me think immediatley of the song ""Weep For Jamie"" - one line especially; ""Weep for Jaamie / For the bones that tear / at the flesh inside /Weep for Jaamie / For she lives in the land /where her father / Died""  I know that may be a strange reference, even an unknown one to most of you, but it is the only thing which has given me the same feeling as this film. Well, ""Benny & Joon"" (also with Depp) did somewhat of the same ilk, but that is different.  The point to this ramble? See the film. Buy the film. Laugh. Cry. Give your dog a haircut (why not?!). Ponder humanity. And remember the magic that the first snow holds. Peace on earth, good will to all....",971913600,,2234,4.278959810874705
1188135,4,B000005QLO,"When I heard that this film was coming out on DVD for its 10th Anniversary, I was overjoyed.  This is probably Tim Burton's best film to date- IMO.  And with a stellar cast- Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Dianne Wiest, Alan Arkin, Kathy Baker, and of course, Vincent Price- how can you go wrong?
The story is fantastic, brilliantly acted out by all the cast.  Such an innocent person introduced into a world of such bad things.  Of course they except him, but when he does something that is not his fault, they immediately disregard him.
As for the DVD extras, well, when I first heard about this DVD, I thought that it would be loaded with them.  Apparently not.  The two commentaries by Danny Elfman and Tim Burton are great, but unfortunately, from there it goes downhill.  I expected much more concept art than is shown, as is the case with the featurette.  Basically all that is, is the stars answering a few questions.  I expected an half hour program and was looking forward to seeing some info on how the hands were made.  The Soundbites could have been put into the featurette to have made it longer, but trailers and TV spots were a cool- always a welcome sight
The only reason I have not given it five stars, is because of the disappointment in the extras.  IMO, it would have been nice to have had ""Vincent"" in there as well.",971481600,,1333,4.466942148760331

1188137,4,B000005QLO,"The concept of holiday films as become a cliche over the years and one I've grown long tired of.  Holiday films peeked in 1990 with two of the best and most drasticly different of their gere.  While John Hughes decided to go the way of slapstick with Home Alone, Tim Burton took his artform to a new level with Edward Scissorhands.  It transends the holiday movie and has become a kind of contemporary classic complete with an excellent performace by Depp and one of the most unforgetable scores by Danny Elfman (who aides Burton in the DVD comentary track).  Depp plays Edward, a kind of Frankenstein whose left with scissors for hands after the man who invented him dies.  He lives alone without human contact until one day Diane Wiest's avon lady comes calling and introduces him to a whole new world.  It's both strange and exciting for Edward whose initially excepted as the eclectic towsfolk use him as a hedge-trimmer and hair-stylist.  Use is the appropriate word because once his usefulness runs up, a call to lynch him goes up in town.  At the center of all this is Winnona Ryder whose tender relationship with Edward will tug at the heartstrings of even the most cynical of critics.  It's a dark comedic fable, at times very abstract with it's messages but all the better movie because of it.",971049600,,1303,4.655021834061135

1188139,5,B000005QLO,"It is difficult to find another film that has captured the essence of the fairy tale better than this one. Wrapped up in a young girl's question of why it snows in the winter, the film tells a simple fable of a person created by an old inventor. Slowly this person was put together, but tragically the inventor dies before he is finished, leaving the person with scissors for hands. The strange man is brought into a new, strange world - our own - and thus begins our story.
Fairy tales are pure style in themself; in films, fairy tale style and delicacy are difficult to capture. I can't fault this movie for running out of plot steam at the end, because the genre demands such simplicity to the tale. Within the tale, Tim Burton says a lot through striking visuals - from the pastel-colored, gossipy world, to the quirky world of the inventor. Like many of the best fairy tales, there is subtle parodies of society invoked, and you may laugh at a few of the concepts.
But what's really striking about this film is the tender outsider story, the heart of the film. Outsider stories are common in Hollywood movies, but few (dare I say none) display such empathy and innocence. Tim Burton's outsider, as portrayed by Johnny Depp, struggles to fit in with the world, but is too innocent to do so. It is this - the innocence and heart - of Johnny Depp's character, that makes this movie incredibly powerful.  Danny Elfman's delicate, dream-like score (his best so far) further enhances the effect, with beautiful layers of boy's choir enveloping the most striking visual elements.
This is one of my favorite films. I don't think everyone will get it because of its outsider fairy-tale nature - its not for everyone. But its definitely one of the best films of its genre - certainly one of the most enchanting.",970099200,10,1806,4.608695652173913
1188140,5,B000005QLO,"""Edward Scissorhands"" reminds me of nothing so much as one of those fantastic Caribbean meals that blends flavors, colors, and textures you'd never think of putting together -- but, prepared by the artful chef, becomes an eating experience to be retold for years. The characters are its pungent ingredients: Johnny Depp's innocent Edward, Winona Ryder's ethereal Kim, Alan Arkin's crusty Bill, Dianne Wiest's sweet Peg, Anthony Michael Hall's brutal Jim, Kathy Baker's man-hungry Joyce, and Vincent Price's cadaverous, fatherly Inventor. Edward's world gives color, from his black and white castle, to his eerily green gardens, to the pastel-mint kitsch of his neighbors' houses. The story brings the meal together with chew and crunch -- and Edward's and Kim's romance finishes dinner sweetly.
Of course, when your chef is Tim Burton and your server is Vincent Price (in one of his last performances), the lights are dim, the tablecloth black, and the candlesticks cobwebbed. Though told as a children's fable -- which, like Rocky and Bullwinkle, is a special treat for the grownups who ""get"" what the kids don't -- this might not be for young ones who still fear the darkness under the bed. But for anyone older, set aside an evening. Start with jerk chicken, roll ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and relive it all over a rich coconut pudding.",969753600,3,1336,5.13302752293578
1188141,4,B000005QLO,"Every director probably has one movie that he pours part of himself into.  For Spielberg, it was ET, Lucas had American Graffiti.  Here, Tim Burton poured into the soul of Edward Scissorhands the world of an outsider, a creation of an old inventor (wonderfully played by Vincent Price) who passes on before he can finish Edward(wonderfully played by Johnny Depp).  Edward is one day discovered by Peg Boggs, a curious Avon lady, who takes Edward home to suburbia, a community of multi-colored houses that could only come from the mind of Burton and production designer Bo Welch.  Danny Elfman delivers probably his most moving score in this picture.  The DVD looked like it would be incredile with what was announced, but it would have to lose starts for what I thought: 1)Audio commentary by Burton and Elfman: Both of these guys do not talk all the way through the film, (though it does sound a little better than Devlin and Emmerich on ID4's DVD & Barry Levinson and Tommy LEe Jones on Men In Black, who chatter on like inane movie theater patrons).  But most of the time I found myself wondering when they would speak again.  Burton probably speaks 12-15 times through most of the movie, but it sounds more like he's having little afterthoughts.  Elfman's audio plays after certain music segments are done (his background music plays over the dialogue so we hear outright how it sounds). 2)Tim Burton concept art: after seeing The Tarzan Collector's Edition, this was a letdown, with only about 7 pieces of art (5 concepts of Edward, 1 of the Inventor, and 1 of Edward's place in the mansion's attic). 3)The featurette talking about the film is also a letdown, as there is nothing that was reall notable (I was really looking forward to hearing how Stan Winston Studios made the Scissorhands props).  The only cool notable is the interactive menu, made like a pop-up book of the mansion Edward is found in.  If you are looking to find a great movie, get this DVD.

otherwise the DVD  menu is wonderful. the audio clips were way too short, depp, ryder, burton  and a couple other people only had about 30 seconds to 1 minute interviews,  which were definitely cut way too short and pieced together  wrong.

1188156,5,B000005QLO,"I absolutely love this film. I remember seeing it 5 times, at least, when  it came to theaters. One of the most beautiful things I remember was how  Burton bookended the film with the story of a Grandmother explaining to her  grandaughter why it snows. That was truly one of the most emotion provoking  scenes I can remember in any movie.
I don't know why this movie hits me  so hard, but it will always be one of my favorites. Many of Burton's  creations leave me wanting or just leave me period, yet this movie has  stayed in my heart since the first day I saw it.  Johnny Depp does a  remarkable job conveying the duality of his role. Winona Rider is beautiful  and unreachable as well; however, in the end perhaps not so unreachable as  Edward would have believed. I have no doubt anyone who has had an  unrequited love will be in tears many times in this movie. ""Ice  Dance"" is one of the great scenes and the music alone still brings  tears to my eyes even today.
All in all, this is a movie I have seen so  many times I don't even remember. But, each time it elicits the same  response. Compassion, brotherhood, sadness, happiness and many other  emotions come and go as the movie ebbs and turns.
""Edward  Scissorhands"" reminds me of ""Tsuki no Tragedy"" or in English  ""Tragedy of the Moon"" which is the ending theme from several  ""Tenchi Muyo"" episodes. It relays the sadness of a love which is  never returned and as the credits end RyoOhki ( a cute rabbit/cat mix long  story ) ,listening to the song, sheds a tear. That song and this movie have  much in common as they both bring forth the same emotions, one using both  visuals and a haunting score, the other with some of the most beautiful  lyrics ever written. I can imagine Edward sitting in his room and singing  that song to himself--especially the last verse:
""I love the warm  emotion you bring, though there is pain I don't complain.
How you can  inspire me, whenever we're together.
Everytime it's like a new song. You  move me so, I think you know
I won't even say a word. In your arms or far  from sight, I'll be your light
...like the lonely Moon.""
I like a  great deal of movies. I truly love only few. This is one of the few. Every  film buff, no, every person who loves a good story must own this film as it  is the very definition of ""fairy tale"".",968112000,,2325,4.320185614849188

1188158,5,B000005QLO,"It had to be a difficult pitch, even with the brilliant blockbuster director of ""Batman"" and ""Beetlejuice"" attached: a  fairy tale-like romantic-dramedy about an unreal man with scissors for  hands, who is taken in by an Avon lady with expectedly chaotic results.  However Tim Burton convinced the studio moguls to produce this film, it has  been for the benefit of movie lovers everywhere. ""Edward  Scissorhands"" is the most hauntingly, strikingly original and  beautiful film to come out in decades, and we still have not seen anything  quite like it since.
I have already exposed as much of the plot as I am  going to in this review. A straightforward recantation of the story would  not do justice to the complex thematic elements, the incredible imagery,  the perfect score, or the once-in-a-lifetime performances given by Johnny  Depp, Winona Ryder, and the rest of the amazing cast.
I say ""complex  thematic elements"" because that is exacly what this film is full of.  Many may laugh this off, thinking that the film is nothing more than a  strange love story made for a mainstream audience. To truly appreciate this  film, however, you have to examine the undercurrents of discrimination,  small-town politics, ideals of society and modern culture, and of course  exclusionism.
The visuals are nothing short of amazing. My favorite is  the obvious yet perfect contrast between the neon colors of the  neighborhood's cars, houses, and people and the pure black and whites of  Edward. You will find many other interesting visual ques obviously, such as  the ""BANK"" and the castle. Consistently side-by-side with these  visuals, the music is simply breathtaking. No other film score come close  to matching the brilliance of Danny Elfman's music, and no other score  complements a film so well. And for the performances, let's just say that I  believe this film to be the height of the careers of many of the stars,  particularly Johnny Depp, who has never quite achieved this level of  quality since.
Do not believe that just because this film was made by a  major studio with major actors and a major director that it can be passed  off as mainstream fluff. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of the most  underestimated and understated films of the decade. It is sure to gain the  recognition and understanding it deserves in the near future.",967680000,,2344,4.979328165374677

1188176,5,B000005QLO,"I distinctly remember seeing the trailer for this film in the movie theater and a person near me said loudly ""won't be seeing that movie."" It's not for everyone - But it has since become my favorite  fantasy film. Straight from Tim Burton's subconscious vision he paints the  tale a sensitive, isolated stranger who is brought into the realm of  Day-Glo suburbia by an Avon lady with the best of intentions. The story  unfolds as the Main character is perceived as both creative and destructive  by the denizens of this pristine, ordered world. The consequences are  always grimm - but bittersweet, beautiful, visual storytelling takes this  classic theme and elevates it to the highest artform a film can acheive.  Edward is Frankenstein's Monster as the artist in society. The outsider who  is appreciated for what they produce - but abhorred as a personality by  those who worship their art. This should have been out on DVD much  sooner!  With commentary by Burton and the soundtracks composer Danny  Elfman. I can't say how much of a treat this will be for fans of both. So  to quote a classic episode of Seinfeld featuring two Italian Barbers ""  Edwardo Scissorhandsa, He maka me cry..."" I am it it is me and so  on.

tragic movie about a very lonely man, living in a  wickedly haunting house on top of the hill. he leads a very sad life, as  can be shown by the many scrapes and scars on his face where he has tried  to wipe away tears..... he finds true love, but can not be with her because  of his ""deformity""....society judges him of course, as we do with  anyone who isn't ""normal""...and he goes back to live in isolation  for the rest of his life...while filled with fun moments, especially the  lawn sculptures, it really made me empathize with his lonliness....",961718400,2,697,4.528
1188180,5,B000005QLO,"I, first off, am a very big Tim Burton fan. I have been sinceNightmare Before Christmas and Beetlejuice. His art concepts and styleare unique and each of his films speak volumes about what it's like to be the outcast. We have all felt like that at one time or another, and it's obvious that it's a feeling that is continually manifesting itself within Tim himself. That is why all his works are so genius. He lives his art and work. It is who he is. And Edward Scissorhands is such an example of how he feels. Shut out and hidden from the rest of the world, including a small suburban neighborhood filled with nosy overweight women, Edward hides in his creator's castle, until Avon calls. Diane Wiest sweetly portrays the Avon lady who graciously takes Edward into her home, introducing him to her family and neighbors. They all don't know what to think, until his scissorhands prove useful to them, as he trims dogs' fur. All the neighbors are lined up to have Edward trim their dogs. A side plot to the film is the brewing friendship between Edward and the teenage girl he's living with, played by a Tim Burton favorite, Winona Ryder. 'Edward Scissorhands' is a sweet and accurate story about not being accepted, then being accepted, then being rejected by all except those who really matter to you.

1188193,5,B000005QLO,"I am a huge Tim Burton fan, and love all of his movies and own them, have  watched them at least 10 times each, and each one is really special to me  (I know how dorky that sounds) but this is the one I am the most emotional  about. I can't think of any other movie that has made me cry as often  during the course of the movie, or as hard.  When I saw it in the theater,  I wasn't just tearing up, I was sobbing by the end. During the scene where  Vincent Price (God I miss him) perfectly cast as ""The Inventor""  tells Edward he has a special present for him and hold up a pair of perfect  hands, only to slip away at the last moment, I looked around the 3rd time I  saw in the theater, and literally everyone in the theater was choked up if  not outright crying, including grown men. If I ever want to cry on demand,  all I have to do is simply *remember* the last scene of the movie, and the  last few lines uttered by the storyteller, and I tear up. Just pulling up  the image of Ryder, spinning around in the 'snow' dreamily, can still bring  tears to my eyes 9 years later. I think this is the only movie I've seen  where I actually had to sit there all through the credits trying to pull it  together because I couldn't stop crying. My friend and I were still  sniffling walking out of the theater. Other women out there: this is not a  movie to watch when you have PMS, not unless you want to totally break down  in a sobbing, emotional heap.
There's so many great things about this  movie-- Tim Burton is a genius, plain and simple, and the art direction is  brilliant. His vision of suburbia is great, with rows and rows of  identical, colorful 50's style tract houses and flawless green lawns. The  imagery will stick with you long after the movie is over; for instance, the  shot of the little girl, getting told a bedtime story (the film's framing  device) in a huge, oversized bed, almost buried in all the quilts and  pillows, or the inventor's workshop, with an assembly line pumping out  gingerbread men. Elfman does do his best work (other than Beetlejuice).  Winona Ryder and Johnny Depp were a couple at the time the movie was made,  deeply in love, and it shows. It actually hurts to look at them, and Ryder,  even with a horrible blonde wig, is stunningly beautiful and radiant. Just  the way they look at each other, the longing in both their eyes, the  tenderness when she says, ""Hold me"" and Edward replies sadly,  ""I can't"", so Kim (Ryder) lovingly wraps her arms around him  instead-- it gets me every time. All the casting is great (Vincent Price,  especially -- obviously, Tim Burton got his dream cast for this one).  Anyone who has ever felt like an outsider, or lonely, or longed for someone  they know they will probably never end up with, will be touched deeply.  (Starcrossed lovers always get to me). Yeah, I know. This all sounds very  corny, but this movie is really in a class by itself. Period.",959904000,34,2934,4.3119266055045875
1188194,4,B000005QLO,"This is director Tim Burton's first cinema pairing with the excellent actor Johnny Depp - a partnership that's still going (on and off) to this day (see also 'Ed Wood' and 'Sleepy Hollow', which are both excellent  films).  'Edward Scissorhands' is 100% fairy tale, with a lonely hero  trapped in a dark gothic castle.  The difference is that the hero looks  like a villain - his spiky black hair very reminiscent of The Cure's Robert  Smith (does anyone else recall the running Scissorhands / Smith running  joke on 'The Mary Whitehouse Experience'? - one sketch included Edward  Collander-hands, I remember!).
One thing I love about this film is the  all-pastel fifties village overlooked by the castle - very 'Pleasantville',  but even more 'pleasant'.  Also, there's a funny parallel between Tim  Burton's ""Edward Scissorhands"" and Edward D. Wood Jr's ""Plan  9 From Outer Space""; Burton's film features the horror great Vincent  Price in his last serious role; Wood's film stars the horror great Bela  Lugosi in his last (albeit very brief) role.  Burton later made the film  ""Ed Wood"" as an homage to the late director (and Depp plays  Edward Wood, having previously played Edward Scissorhands!) - I wonder if  Burton will be paid a similar tribute decades into the future?

1188195,5,B000005QLO,"This wildly imaginative movie is Tim Burton's best, because it seems to be completely real to him as a filmmaker.  From the gorgeous opening credits, set to Danny Elfman's candy-coated but melancholy musical score, to the  swirling finale, this movie captivates, amuses and stirs the heart.  Johnny  Depp is exceptional in a role that might have been slapstick with no heart;  he is tender, appealing, funny and oh so sad in the role of a creative  misfit.  Dianne Weist is also that perfect balance of cartoon and real  human; she evokes a maternal warmth that adds balance to the neighbors who  seems more one-dimensional.  This movie has some insightful and warmly  realized messages to convey as well.  Look for Vincent Price in a perfect  final role; it is both a tribute and a legacy of his career playing  off-kilter madmen.  Most of all, though, this movie has a Christmas heart,  and the sweetnees in its innocent romance, its sad story of misfits, and  its pop-art scenic design captivate all of your senses.

1188196,5,B000005QLO,"This is a highly imaginative tale of a young man whose over the top,  unusual gifts make it impossible to fit into a very narrow minded community. Johnny Depp is heartbreakingly different and creative in a role  that is difficult to pin down. Is it about racism, being unusually  creative, or just about trying to fit circles into squares? Perhaps it is  about just being different. It seems to me that the most poignant cross to  bear would be to not have anyone to share your view of the world with.  Edward Scissorhands has absolutely no one who can truely understand his  existence and special gifts.. His expressions demonstrate, to me, a deep  void. We are ultimately alone, and to find a soul mate, who you can share  your joys, passions,  gifts, and self with is something highly creative  individuals yearn for, and what I believe this film portrays. I can almost  see this character thinking: ""Is there anybody who can completely  appreciate  and unconditionally love who I am? Is there anyone who I can  tell my secrets to?""

1188202,5,B000005QLO,"Edward Scissorhands appears (on the surface) to be a fairytale that as many reviewers have written describes what it's like to be an outsider.  Well that's only part of the story.  The film is a masterful social  commentary about racism and how it affects its victims.
If you notice  all of the characters are white and all of the houses appear colorful.  Yet  Edward is dressed entirely in black, lives in a dark castle and most  poignantly his entire demeanor is in stark contrast to the films other  characters.  Edward is quiet and shy while all the other characters are  brash and often borish.  Yet when he does speak his words reflect deep  introspection and caring.  None of this is to say that this is how blacks  are perceived today in a predominately white society but merely to  illustrate the contrast between the two apparently different worlds.
As  the film unfolds however Edward's humanity is revealed.  Of course that  humanity is already apparent to Dianne Weist and Alan Arkin but they are  the only characters who have genuine feeling for Edward.  The other  characters only view him as a curiosity without seeing the real person  inside.
Edward yearns to be 'normal' like everyone else.  What he doesn't  realize though is that he is the greater creature and that others should  endeavor to be more like him.  He sees the beauty in that 'other' world but  no matter how hard he tries he just isn't accepted.  In the end he is  driven to violence and ultimately forced to retreat into his own world but  not because of his own inadequacies but because society just won't accept  him for what he is.
  Tim Burton is to be commended for crafting a film  that teaches fundamental lessons about humanity and what american society  does to many of its' 'citizens' who fall outside of the mainstream.  His  true genius is that no reviewer yet has really seen the film for what it  really is yet the majority recognize and are moved by its fundamental  truths.",951350400,,1974,4.67741935483871

One thing i'd like to ask, just in case any one  who reads this knows, why is Edward Scissorhands considered a  ""family"" movie? if i had children I most certainly wouldn't let  them watch it.

This is a genuinely  moving film, with great acting, incredible production design, and, best of  all, music. Elfman's score is so gorgeous and intense, bringing out the  innocence in Edward and the cynicism in society. This is an extremely  emotional film, not because of the grand facade, but for the smaller  moments. Kim dances in the snowflakes from Edward's ice sculpture because  that is the only real way they could love eachother. Edward gently touches  his would-be hands, then cuts them to shreds when his master dies. Peg sees  that Edward has cut his face in the mirror. The steps taken to bring out  the feeling in the viewer are very skilled, the film is made on an  elaborate chessboard. At first funny, then mocking, then downright serious  and tragic, this film in the end helps us all discover the more unusual  side to our natures.
