8400131,4,B003M780FA,"The title suggests a routine wartime espionage caper, or perhaps a mad-scientist B-movie (the intelligent Lamarr, moonlighting with composer George Antheil, had patented her radio-detection torpedo innovation just two years prior). Instead, with its title derived from Hippocrates, this is an exceptionally stylish Jacques Tourneur gaslit melodrama, midway between the voodoo medicine of I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE and the great shadowy noir OUT OF THE PAST. Here George Brent and Albert Dekker--frequently typecast as medical men--play doctor and sculptor, both circumstantially sucked into the upscale, wayward lives of the very Gothic couple played by Paul Lukas and Hedy Lamarr. As in ZOMBIE, the story is told with spectacular visual flair (Tourneur's DP was Tony Gaudio), and as in the Mitchum noir the storytelling is purposely oblique and retroactive, with flashbacks and a long backstory divulged through biographical manuscript and diaries.

The gaslighting theme, repeatedly copied from Thorold Dickinson's superior UK original, is minimized here, and Tourneur's 1944 film has more in common with subsequent films, including LAURA, Lamarr's Ulmer film STRANGE WOMAN, Sirk's SLEEP, MY LOVE and Siodmak's SPIRAL STAIRCASE (Dr. George Brent again). The lavish RKO sets were partly repurposed from MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, and Tourneur stages this film in a cozily snowbound 1903 Manhattan. The stylistic gimmicks are abundant, including the spiral staircase, weird shoes on the good doctor's stalker, Lamarr's fabulous jade necklace (and her less than fabulous portrait), a strange aquarium gallery begging to be smashed, a wonky gas furnace and a fully exploded brownstone mansion.

Lukas, Brent and Dekker underplay their roles, Lamarr is passively and very glamourously victimized, and Tourneur flaunts creative directorial flourishes with actors, decor, light and shadow, also with the crabwise progression of the storyline, not fully resolved at the sunny finale. Many viewers prefer this more stylized and novelistic gaslighting drama to the stagebound Dickinson or Cukor versions of a familiar story, and Tourneur's sideways exposition of the story arc, accompanied by such baroque visual flair, makes the film worthy of repeat viewings. RKO was an ideal artistic haven for Welles, Val Lewton, Tourneur, Mark Robson and Robert Wise, and Tourneur in particular thrived on these lesser, derivative projects, making every programmatic studio assignment visually distinctive and stylistically unique.",1471737600,4,2505,5.78590785907859
8400132,1,B003M780FA,"This movie made me uncomfortable...and confused.  Sure Allida is young and beautiful.  But does that explain why every man she meets tries to hit on a married woman?  What is that last scene with the detective about?  He has guessed that the dead man in the house - burned beyond description - was Allida's husband and not the butler.  But, when she whines about the future of her son, he says, ""Oh.  Never mind!""
I can't understand anything about Nick.  He killed his young rival and his sister.  Did he want to kill himself from the ship or in a fire in his home?  Why?  Did he want to kill his wife and child?  Why?  Was he the guy with the weird shoes?  If so, why didn't Hunt recognize him when the dropped coin hit Nick's shoe and Hunt picks it up?  How did Nick find Hunt's secret bathtub hiding place for the books without disturbing anything else in the apartment?  Why would retrieval of the books by Nick be necessary at all?  Was it Nick who was following Hunt?  Why?
Brent (Hunt) is simply too chunky to be a good mate for Lammar (Allida),  Why would a psychiatrist fall in love with a patient?  Why would Hunt's friend tell Hunt that Nick is with him at the club when Nick is, at that moment, turning on all the gas valves in his home?  Why would Nick throw away the yellow roses Allida ordered for the dinner table in the staircase which everybody uses to get to the baby's room?  Why would Nick say that nobody would hear the pistol shot when Nick killed Hunt?  Why would you have such a long-winded conversation with a man you intend to kill with a pistol?  Likewise, why was Nick having such a long conversation with Allida's young lover before Nick ran him over with a carriage?  Why would Nick want to kill his sister?  Why would Nick's sister refuse to stay in Nick's home?  After arguing with him in Nick's home, how did Nick manage to get Allida's lover to stand in the middle of the street so Nick could run him over with a carriage?  I can't recommend such a sloppy movie.",1451347200,,1997,4.3126684636118595
8400133,5,B003M780FA,"I came upon this movie on the late show many years ago, catching it after it had started.  I was intrigued, not only by the story, but also by the cinematography, the art & set decoration, which received an Oscar nomination, and the incredible beauty of Hedy Lamarr.  I called the tv station to find out what it was and they told me it was Experiment Perilous from 1943.  At that time, the movie was not available on VHS or DVD so I went to eBay and found a copy of the book on which it was based by Margaret Carpenter.  Upon reading it, I discovered the movie was a pretty faithful adaptation of the book, which is great in itself.  When Warner Archives finally released it on DVD-R, I was able to see the complete film.  It's now one of my favorite of the period and I highly recommend it!",1442102400,5,791,4.2052980132450335
8400134,5,B003M780FA,Great movie and I can stream it to my TV.,1438646400,,41,3.2
8400135,4,B003M780FA,"This movie is the fill in Lamarr did after missing out on ""Gaslight"" and in many ways is a similar story.  Hedy plays the wife tormented by a demented controlling husband looking for revenge over a past ""could be"" secret.  Brent is the sympathetic and naturally entranced psychiatrist employed to help the situation, but you are kept guessing the motives until near the end.  There are some remarkable special effects scenes for the time and as usual Lamarr is the visual focal point.  A good movie but not a classic.  It is one of Hedy's better acting roles and Paul Lukas is great as always.",1423180800,2,593,4.609523809523809
8400136,3,B003M780FA,"I'll watch anything that has Hedy Lamarr in it.  Happily this is a nicely restored rendering.  The movie is mostly a bore, but I buy these DVDs just to stare at Hedy, keeping my drool cup tucked under my chin.",1381708800,4,209,4.2
