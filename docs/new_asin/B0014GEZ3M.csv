8255663,5,B0014GEZ3M,"The Day of the Jackal, 1973 film

August 1962 was a stormy time for France. The OAS hated de Gaulle for giving independence to Algeria. They attempted to assassinate de Gaulle, but luck was still with Charles le Grand. The conspirators decided to hire a professional who is unknown in France. It is possible to assassinate de Gaulle, the trick is to get away to spend the pay-off. No notes must be kept, the OAS leaders must be carefully guarded until the job is done. The assassin begins to study his target, who will always be in public. This Jackal will create a valid but false identity using a dead person's name. We see his preparations for the job; we see the French Secret Service shadowing the OAS high command. The OAS planted a spy on a high-level Minister in Paris. ""Duggan"" arranged for another set of identity papers, then visits Paris to scout for a room on the top floor. August in Paris is vacation time; ""Duggan"" buys French clothes for his disguise.

The French Secret Service captured the OAS messenger and interrogated him to get information. But they only learned the outline of the plot, not the details. The French need to identify the person who visited the OAS leaders for half an hour two months earlier! They contact foreign police for their informal cooperation. The film shows them investigating leads while ""Duggan"" continues his preparations. The film shows what is happening there is often little explanatory dialogue. ""Duggan"" figures how to find a place where his papers won't be checked, and how to disguise his white car. This stress takes a toll on ""Duggan"". The best-laid plans never allow for human error or the unexpected. The murder of Madame now makes this an ordinary crime of murder. But ""Duggan"" knows of a trick or two; he will not stay in a public hotel. The police are able to figure out the new identity, and identify the Minister who leaked the information. ""Duggan"" silences another person who helped him. August 25 is the celebration of Liberation Day in Paris, a major French holiday. De Gaulle will appear for a speech and award medals. The scenes of a French parade reminds me of the parades of yesteryear.

""Duggan"" reinvents himself disguised as a one-legged French veteran of the Resistance. He is able to pass the barriers for the public and enters an apartment house to go up to the top floor, then enter an empty apartment to prepare for the assassination. Detective Lebel checked with the police guards, and learned of the one-legged man. He takes this gendarme up to the top floor where they prevent the assassination. This film was a big hit for its dramatic story. The parallels to the assassination of JFK are obvious but unstated. Like other fast-paced films, you won't think of the implausibilities (the dependence on being able to pass a police barrier!). Would Detective Lebel take part in the search unarmed? [You can compare this film to the earlier book to see how they changed and simplified the story.] It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun. How did this killer escape before his last job?",1520640000,,3087,4.691881918819188
