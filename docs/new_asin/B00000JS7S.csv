1238365,4,B00000JS7S,"Sakura Wars... a great anime, a great game. But... only 4 freaking episodes? The ending to the thing was horribly abrupt. But, that's the only backfire. So otherwise... enjoy!",954806400,,175,5.068965517241379
1238366,5,B00000JS7S,"I have heard the negatives of Sakura Wars and I have heard the positives. I for one think it is a wonderful video. The soundtrack by Kouhei Tanaka is one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of hearing and I have a most  extensive collection of over 150. After ordering the soundtrack CD from  Japan and listening to it at length I find I enjoy this DVD more than ever.  Without a doubt it sports one of the best opening songs ever (at least as  far as the get you up and going factor) and the track used for the big  ending battle in the 4th chapter is truly a work of art. It is a great  piece that is woven expertly into the fight. An excellent arrangement which  brings home the strength and power of the series. I recommend the  soundtrack most highly as well as the DVD. That battle in the 4th chapter  would make an excellent demo of an audio video system as well. The story is  also great. Granted it is not always the smoothest thing going and yes it  does have its silly moments as well, but it is a compelling story which is  presented well. One caution though-do NOT listen to the English dub! It is  horrific and changes what are decent lines and sometimes really good lines  into fodder for toddlers. Here is an example from the 4th chapter,  ""Let's get those evil nasty Demons. They are bad."" Ugh! Bear with  the subtitles and you will be much happier for it. It is sad that companies  feel they have to dumb things down for American audiences. I love Anime and  it physically hurts me to see such great movies like Mononoke and Windaria  as well as this one ripped from the guts by English lines that are  infantile or delivered with the enthusiasm of a rock. Passion is an  ingredient in many Anime movies and it is one often removed in the English  edit-not always (Grave of the Fireflies) but often. As long as you don't  listen to the sometimes insultingly bad English dialog this will pan out to  be a wonderful movie to watch. Get it! I love it!",950313600,13,1971,4.264864864864865
1238367,5,B00000JS7S,"It love this movie. I enjoyed how they kept the songs in Japenese with subtitles. The fighting  moves were spectacular. There is a character for all personalities. Great for kids, I think. A Plus for All ages",944870400,2,208,4.621621621621622
1238368,4,B00000JS7S,"A lot of people who reviewed Sakura Wars said it was pretty bad - mostly because it was impossible to follow and the fight scenes were too short. Well, the OAV's still have a lot to offer; some pretty good steampunk  visuals, attractive character design, and (with 2 notable exceptions)  fairly attractive character personalities, too. I'd say it would be better  if it were LONGER, mostly because there's a lot of good material left  untapped here. Definitely worth the price if you're into shoujo anime.",943920000,2,505,4.905882352941177
1238399,5,B00000JS7S,"The Imperial Fighting Troupe is called again to defend Tokyo against demons. However, this time, the Douglas-Stewart Company is selling a superior fighting machine that will revolutionze Japan's defense and make the Flower Division obsolete. However, the girls suspect something wrong when the members of their team begin to vanish!",1127865600,,332,5.66
1238400,5,B00000JS7S,"Once upon a time there was an extremely pair of Japanese video games entitled Sakura Taisen, which told the story of the Imperial Flower Combat Troop - a group of young women who are actresses by day and demon killers at night (I might have that reversed).  Their struggles to defend Tokyo and an incredible plot that mixed magical girl, combat, demons, and Shakespeare in way no normal mind could predict caught on like wildfire, and it was only a matter of time before the video games were redone as a TV series.  Preparing the way for the series was this delightful OVA which introduces the plot and characters to the small handful of people who didn't know about the games.

The story unfolds in a 1920's 'steampunk' version of Tokyo.  Traditional clothes and mundane street scenes are a background for gothic machines that puff and clank impressively.  Having fought off one attempt by alien looking demons, the mood is tense as everyone waits for the next wave of evil.  Gradually, the Flower Combat Troop is brought together:  Kanzaki Sumire - obnoxious grand-daughter of the man who has invented the spiritual armor the troop uses; Maria Tachibana - first captain of the team; Iris Chateaubriand - a very young and powerful psychic;  Kirishima Kanna - the tough warrior; Ri Kohran, the team's mad scientist, and Ichiro Ohgami - one of the few men who can move Oubu (actually Koubu) armor.

And last, but hardly least, there is Shinguji Sakura.  Her father fought and died during the previous Demon Wars as possessor of the power to seal evil power.  She has inherited that capability, as well as the Spirit Sword Arataka.  Her first struggles are to awaken her ability to use the sword.  That done, she comes to the Flower Division where she must overcome her clumsiness and difficulty with machines as she becomes an important part of the team.

'Team' is an important word here.  While the plot is either about acting or the killing of demons, the real story is the relationship among the members of the Troop.  In the final analysis it is their abilities to transcend their own natures and open their hearts to each other that makes a fractious group of talented women into a fearsome mecha team.

Graphics, animation and music are excellent, and the success of this OVA paved the way for the TV series which captured hearts everywhere.  The healthy and upbeat nature of this set makes it a natural choice for almost any age group and one of the better introductions to one of anime's most popular forms.",1122854400,,2515,4.729357798165138
1238401,2,B00000JS7S,"For $10, you get a single 24-minute episode that has a lot of sad looks and tearjerking scenes. Nothing happens that you don't expect...

Anyway, though Sumire is gone, the excellent Paris Kagekidan series (""L'Ecole de Paris"") continues the Sakura Wars OVA series. (And maybe we'll have another OVA with the New York Kagekidan in the future.)

I imported the Japanese limited-edition version of this. It cost US$60 after all the costs were added together. In retrospect, it was an idiotic purchase. (At least the Japanese version came with a replica of the purple shirts you see in the episode.)

If you really love the character of Sumire, and if you understand Japanese, I would recommend purchasing the Kanzaki Sumire Retirement Performance DVD set from an importer or auction site. You get over four hours of live action performance by the Japanese actors and actresses of the Sakura Wars series, plus backstage film, interviews, and a really nice book that contains the script for the performance.",1120089600,3,1002,5.024096385542169
1238402,5,B00000JS7S,"Based on the original Sakura Wars OVA and Television Series comes Sakura Taisen. Sumire Kanzaki, the inventor of the Kobo is loosing her powers to control the spirit armor.

This short one episode DVD (only 24 minutes) sets up the remainder of the story line to come.

Originally a ADV film release (Sakura Wars OVA and Sakura War TV)this story line takes place shortly after the Sakura Wars (The Movie) (a Pioneer Entertainment Release).

This group of stories is released by Funaimation Productions. Several of the voice actors who have become so familier in the original Sakura Wars OVA and Television DVD's return to bring a close to their characters.

Sumire, who is now in her early twenty's has lost the ability to control the Kobo and she feels she has lost the ability to perform on stage. In an effort to retire gracefully we are treated to scenes from her past. Those who have the entire series on DVD will be in for a treat as some of these scenes have never been seen before in the United States on DVD.

Sumire performs one last time on the Imperial Stage and it is a bit of a surprise for some her fellow members to whom she wants to pass the ""torch"" to.

Sakura Shinguji.

Still clutzy and falling over her two feet, we are treated to an older Sakura now approaching her very late teens. Well worth the purchase and for the follow up DVD's that are to follow.",1100476800,4,1375,4.476
1238403,4,B00000JS7S,"From the acclaimed television and OVA series comes the full length movie of Sakura Wars. The animation is much better in this movie and when you watch the Oobu being loaded on the transporter bullet engine you are in for a wild treat.
Some characters may appear to be flately drawn but this is a more somber and darker movie.
If not familier with the characters do not get this first but buy the TV series then the OVA series followed by this movie. It is then that you will understand the characters. I would have given it a 5 star, but the extended CGI loading and launching of the bullet engine was a bit distracting from the story line.",1083628800,6,640,4.341666666666667
1238404,3,B00000JS7S,I didn't really like this movie. The dubbing on it was not really good. The tv series dubbing is excellent but the dubbing on the movie is terriable to me. This movie was kinda of boring but cool.,1070928000,,196,4.184210526315789
1238405,4,B00000JS7S,"""Sakura Wars - The Movie"" is a creation that builds upon every aspect of the four games which it is based on. For someone who has played these games this movie is a fun experience because all of the characters have already been fleshed out and the parts of the story that the movie doesn't explore have already been explained. It's nice because one doesn't have to listen to a bunch of introductions for characters that they already know, but unfortunately for someone who hasn't played the games this movie must surely seem very disjointed with incredibly shallow characters (and a whole lot of them ^^;). This is a movie for fans, and if you are new to the world of Sakura Taisen this isn't the place to start.
Having played all the games, I have to say I really enjoyed this movie. The animation is a little different from the games (the characters look a bit smaller-eyed), but is absolutely lovely. You can almost understand why the Ecole De Paris OVA and the TV series' animation was so mediocre after watching this, because this is expensive high-quality stuff. They must have spent all their money on it ^^; The backgrounds are especially notable, and the Imperial Theater seems to have gotten a revamp. It's very pretty ^_^
As always, the voice acting is top notch. I can't comment on the english dub because I haven't watched it, but the original will bring back every cast member from Sakura right down to the Baragumi. Lachette's actress is also very good, but even though I have heard she is some sort of professional, I can't stand her singing voice. During the ""Subete wa Umi e"" song performance it's very grating and drowns Sakura's voice out completely.
The story isn't anything special, but it isn't bad. It follows the usual fare... A man named Brent Furlong has brought in a new type of robots, the Jakphiels, that will make the Koubu obsolete, but his real plans are an economic takeover with some city-destroying evilness thrown in. He has a minion named Patrick, blah blah blah... The formula will seem familiar. It is.  Also, an original character, Lachette, is introduced, but there are already eight members of the Hanagumi, and the large focus on her seems silly.
The other characters all have their moments, and there's a lot more character development for Reni than usual, which is nice. Also, Kanna's lines don't consist of only fighting with Sumire. This brings up another point, which is that the characters are actually in-character. The anime endeavors for this game have a tendency to take the most stereotypical trait of a character and just run it into the ground... Over and over again. This movie is a really refreshing change from that. Thank goodness...
The music is by Tanaka Kohei, as usual, and is mainly themes from the game that have been redone. He did a really good job and everything seems very polished, especially the new version of Kiseki no Kane, which has to be 200% better than the original.  There is a rewritten version of ""Subete wa Umi e"" sung by Lachette and Sakura instead of Maria and Sakura, but the lyrics are poor compared to the original and Lachette sounds absolutely horrible... Please, someone bring Maria back... She did a much better job ;_;
In conclusion, because this review has gotten really long (sorry ^^;), if you have played the games you will probably enjoy this movie. If you've only seen the OAV or TV series, or have no knowledge of Sakura Taisen at all, you probably won't like it. This is a total fan movie, and it doesn't really aspire to be more than that.",1069718400,3,3542,4.683788121990369

 this film has all Action fun and beautiful pictures !!!!
No matter you are a Sakura Wars Fan or not Each Anime fan must have seen this film and the Extras on the DVD is wonderful
But there is a mistake in the Limited Edition (not on the DVD)the mistake is on the Mini-Pencil Board Set !!!

1238407,4,B00000JS7S,"This is a pretty cute show. It has excellent animation, a good story, and good music. My beef with it is that the show ends after a couple of episodes--it just stops.
This is an OVA, and the Sakura Wars TV series comes after it. And both come after the game.
I think I should have had a little knowledge of the games before I watched this, since it just picked up with the Demons. It didn't give ANY background on the Demons at all, which had me lost for the first episode or two. But as it went along I stopped worrying about how and why the Demons existed/were there and focused on the show itself.
The dubbing in both versions is top notch. I personally prefer the English version. Since the girls are from various countries, not just Japan, they cannot be expected to speak Japanese all that well, and without an accent. But in the English, we get to hear the girls in their ""native"" tongues and with ""native"" accents. What I mean is this: The French girl *sounds* French (and she even speaks in French when we first meet her). The Russian Maria has a definitive Russian accent, which comes across very well even though we never get to hear her speak in Russian. And the Chinese teenager talks with a Chinese accent, and also speaks in Chinese.
So, watch this. You won't regret doing so, but you might want to watch the TV series just to get a little better idea of what is going on. Or get (or at least see) the games.",1046217600,14,1423,4.29368029739777
1238418,4,B00000JS7S,"With the Sakura Wars video game coming next year, the Sakura Wars 2 OVAs coming out in October, this Sakura Wars DVD was released awhile ago in the USA. Actually, this charm is the Sakura Wars 1 OVA. This will make more sense when the game comes out next year. ^____^ (Get the game!!!)
This DVD is a real treat for us Sakura Wars fans with rich animation (unlike the Sakura Wars TV episodes) and loveable characters. The first 2 or 3 episodes take place before the game and the last two episodes take place somewhere in the game's course. This is why people are like ""what the heck happened?!"" between each episode. This DVD dragged me into the Sakura Wars fandom...which I do not regret! ^_^v Get the second OVAs in October, you won't regret buying this DVD or anything else Sakura Wars, believe me.",1031356800,4,800,4.486301369863014
1238419,3,B00000JS7S,"I orginally brought this DVD because I had heard about it, and was curious about the show. When I watched it, the animation looked great. The colors are very vivid, the characters and settings are beautifully drawn. I mean, the backgrounds were one of the best parts of the show! I enjoyed a lot of the show except for one MAJOR thing: The plot was too weak. Every act left a gaping hole in what had happened. It left me wondering what happened between the eposides. I felt that the plot needed to be developed more, and they needed to be more through with the eposides.
If you enjoy beautiful animation, and awesome settings, then this would be great for you, but if you crave a more through story development, then this wouldn't be right for you. Hope this helps!",1027209600,5,765,4.4714285714285715
1238420,5,B00000JS7S,"Sakura Wars is I find it quite funny in the story but also has brief storyline. I like how the characters all have their own nationalities (Japaneses, Americans, Chinese, Russians,French just to name some)and each character has it own ability of battling because of where they were brought up from and then they use their technic in a mecha. I think it's a good anime in my opinion.",998611200,,382,4.632352941176471
1238421,2,B00000JS7S,"Short review:  Sakura Wars has some of the most beautiful animation that I've seen in an anime series.  I was really struck by the use of color and detail in this anime.  Unfortunately, that's where my enjoyment of this anime ended.  I found the story to be very tired, and the characters about as interesting as drying paint.  Too fluffy for my taste.
If you like ""You're Under Arrest"" then this might be along your line of anime (...but maybe not).  If you like Eva, Lain, and Bebop; then you probably wouldn't get much our of Sakura Wars.  I recommend renting it before committing your hard earned cash.",993600000,3,606,4.555555555555555
1238422,2,B00000JS7S,"""Sakura Wars"" had potential, but ended up being kind of a drag.  The idea behind it is quite cool (steam powered mecha fighting demons in 1920s Tokyo) and I like most of the mecha designs and the character designs, though the demons were embarassingly derivative (Geiger could sue).  The first episode, in which the intriguing background is laid out and we are introduced to some of the characters, is good, but its all downhill from there.  The pacing of the show is glacial; very little seems to happen for long stretches of time while the viewer is subjected to  general chatter which does little to illuminate the characters or make them interesting, plus some tedious training scenes.  (When the characters from Evangelion or Tenchi speak to each other it is funny or insightful, but these people mostly yammer tiresomely.)  Another problem is that there seem to be too many characters, and each one has his or her own seperate story which is not integrated with the stories of the other characters or the main demon-fighting story.  While training scenes and chatty scenes are interminable, the fight scenes are brief, and the first big battle (which is in episode 3) between the mecha and the enemy (some boring knight costumes; the girls fight the Geiger demons in episodes 1 & 2 without the mecha) doesn't even make any sense, as far as I could tell-- the viewer has no idea where the mecha are in relation to each other, each girl is surrounded by lots of enemies who just stand there and get killed.  Despite the ""wars"" moniker this is not an action-oriented anime; I think more time is spent on traditional Japanese dance and theater than on warfare.
Some people seem to really like ""Sakura Wars"", so I guess it is probably worth a rent on the chance that you might be one of those people, but I wouldn't recommend anyone buy it unless they have rented it first.",987984000,,1874,4.674772036474164
1238423,2,B00000JS7S,"Ok, was I the only one who noticed the terrible job that ADV did of mixing the dub in with the music and sfx?(perhaps only on the DVD version)  At times, just to hear what was being said, I had to turn this one up so loud that the music damn near deafened me when it kicked on.  Other than that, not bad, but a little too cutesy for me.  Somewhat interesting twist on the mecha type anime, but if it's mecha you're after, get Evangelion or Gundam way, way, way before you pick this little stinker up.",978393600,,500,4.081632653061225
1238424,3,B00000JS7S,"Sakura Wars, based on a series of Japanese games, is entirely uninspired--which is not to say it's bad.  It just is somewhat bland.  It's a steampunk story--high-technology created with steam engines.  There is also supernatural powers and demons thrown in.  The story is a little opaque; it may make more sense to someone who has played the games.  Essentially, there was a big war between demons and humans (in place of WW I in our world); the demons were beaten back, but now they are returning.  Tokyo is (as it is in so many anime) the key to everything, and the humans create these ESP- and steam-powered robots to defeat them.  The pilots are a bunch of girls who also perform plays in a theater which serves as their base.  It's perhaps a little less odd than that sounds, but some parts of it are never explained and a viewer (such as me) who knows nothing going in is rather left hanging.  There is also no conclusion to the story in this disc; whether or not there is a second disc coming I do not know.
The disc itself looks fine, if not gorgeous.  The character designs are actually pretty nice, but the characters themselves are rather generic: the cutesy little girl, the tough martial artist, the clutzy scientist, etc.  The English dub is what you expect from ADV: nothing wonderful, some liberties taken with the script, but nothing terrible.  That sums up Sakura Wars itself: it's not bad, but it's not something you're likely to return to again and again.",974851200,5,1475,4.609195402298851
1238425,5,B00000JS7S,"One year has passed since when I bought the volume of this series. And you want to know what? I still watch on a near constant basis^_^! But with a crack team of production members, what is there not to like about this  series?
 From my standpoint, nothing(if you are watching the sub  version, dub is just makes it slightly worse). The character's are  beautiful both from a artistry standpoint and the personallities of the  characters themselves(what do you expect when they come from the capable  pen of Kosuke Fujishima, my personal favorite manga author. Never are they  dull, boring, annoying(well, Iris dubbed can get kinda grating...) or my  personal favorite lecherous. They don't try to go to the ""next  step"" with the male lead because in no way would it further the plot  line or character development. As the series contiues, you begin to notice  one of the strongest points of the series, the music! Never have heard such  beautifuly composed music in an anime(well, execpt for maybe Escaflowne).  The music is just so amazing to me, its just so friggin' hard for me to put  it into words! EXTREMELY WELL COMPOSSED seems like an understatement. The  Direction of the series is also one of its major strong points. The action  is always clear and there is never a question on what is going on. During  the scene's where Sakura is in her homeland, you can see the passing  seasons as time goes by. What else can I put here? Oh, the backrounds are  extremely well crafted. The mecha battle scenes are short, but well done.  But the one thing that truly makes me love this series is the intercast  conflicts. With a series thats based around fighting demons, its kinda of  hard to accpoplish this when everybodie's at eachothers throat. This in and  of its self makes the series very enjoyable from my standpoint.
 But it  if there is one flaw to the series  that if you walk into it blindly(I had  some backround info on the series before hand), is that the plot line WILL  no doubt be confusing(knowing of the game, character releationship's helps.  Well, that and as usual the dubbing is just sub-par, but still  tolerable.
So in the end, what are you left with? A true sleeper hit!  Sure, it won't reach Escaflowne or Evangelian(EW! NASTY) hit status, but you  will(or should) walk away pretty statisfied. Plus, if we are lucky, maybe  we will see the second ova series in the near future(or the movie, or the  TV series).",960163200,4,2437,4.656470588235294
7913444,5,B00000JS7S,"Unfortunately, Amazon has combined the reviews of several unrelated Sakura Taisen and Sakura Wars DVD's; this first is a review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sakura-Taisen-Sumire/dp/B0000C7PSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sakura Taisen: Sumire</a>.

Whenever an actor or actress decides to retire from a long running franchise, it poses a difficult choice.  Do you try to continue with a replacement or do you retire the character as well?  What makes this so extraordinary is that I've never heard of anyone doing this before: creating an OVA in which retiring voice and stage actress Michie Tomizawa voices the retirement performance of her Sakura Taisen character Sumire Kanzaki.

The plot premise is that Sumire has reached the age where her Spirit Energy has faded to the point she can no longer operate her koubu, and thus can no longer fight demons so rather than hang around merely as an actress, she decides to retire while she's on top and go on to other things, probably working on koubu improvements at her father's company since a wealthy life of leisure holds no appeal for her.  The result is a predictable weep fest for her colleagues and an only somewhat surprising attempt on her part to encourage Sakura to step up as her replacement in the spotlight.

Frankly, I never understood why a bunch of spirit warriors would want to pass as a troupe of actresses in the first place, other than the fact that the creator Hiroi Ohji wanted them to, but this beautiful farewell provides a lot more justification.  Of course Michie Tomizawa only retired because she was getting married, not for health reasons, so the chances of her and her character returning in more limited ways in the future are actually pretty good, but the spotlight has certainly been passed.

Note: This is a VERY short DVD!  The main feature is only 24 minutes long and the Special Features, most of which are Ohji and her fellow voice actresses singing Michie's praises, are only 14 minutes long.

It starts earlier than the TV series, which means you get to watch the creation of the Flower Division Combat Troupe,  It also explains why the girls were asked to be dancers,  singers, and actresses: to increase their spirit power.  It also better explains the reasoning behind wanting a male commander of the girls.

Defects?  Yes, the complete lack of anything resembling an ending.  After a couple of battles against the demons and a couple of successful stage productions, the story just ends.

We're looking forward to purchasing any upcoming Sumire-free disks.",1145404800,2,166,5.148148148148148
7913452,4,B00000JS7S,"pretty expensive for one episode.  doesn't add anything to the plot, but its good to have closure on one of the fun characters.  id say the best parts are the extras.  you get to see how close knit the cast was.  there is a real story behind that.",1142985600,2,247,4.083333333333333
7913453,3,B00000JS7S,"By ""knowledgable"", I mean folks who have at least played the games (not that those are easy to get in North America!) or watched the OVA or (much preferably) TV series - the latter has MUCH more in the way of character and story background.  In fact, I believe that the intended target audience for this movie was just that - the people in Japan who've played all the games so far and watched everything on TV and therefore are completely up to speed on who's who and what's what. I watched the new 5-DVD set of the TV series, which I've reviewed elsewhere, before I saw this movie, and in consequence I found the movie much more enjoyable.  I do agree with the other reviewer's comment that the movie's ending was rather muddled; to me, it seemed rather tacked on. Also, there was no real effort to introduce the ""new"" characters outside the ones that would already be familiar to most American viewers, but again that's a side effect of the fact that the movie seems to have been intended for a more ""knowledgable"" audience than most anime fans in the U.S.

In short:  If you're already a Sakura Wars fan and have watched the TV series, you'll probably enjoy this.  Otherwise, you're better off watching the OVA or TV series first.",1141171200,2,1233,4.511210762331839
