8662774,5,B00KZ1WD6S,Fantastic documentary. Extensive interviews of passengers and crew left me crying in some cases. Beautifully photographed interview clips humanized their harrowing and sometimes heroic experiences. Highly recommended!!!,1473724800,,219,7.148148148148148
8662775,1,B00KZ1WD6S,"This was a very disappointing documentary.  Of course, they staged the crash, with water filling up plane, and people yelling, and having various personal problems; there are several interviews of the survivors from their point of view, but nothing spectacular in their telling.  What was sorely missed was this:  an interview with the real pilot, his feelings, his reactions, his thoughts.  Instead, they interview the co-pilot.  Messed up.  They do not describe, as other aeronautics documentaries do, a simulated flight of this plane from take off and finally into the water.  They do not explain how the pilot successfully maneuvered the plane into the water; they do not show the cockpit and the instruments that would have to have been used by the pilot.  Overall, there wasn't a scrape of professional information about this whole event.  Just screaming passengers eventually standing on the wings waiting for rescue.  Basically, the plane goes up, and then into the water, with a lot of theatrics. That's about the size of it.  I didn't learn anything relevant about how this professional pilot did what he did.  They interviewed the co pilot; but they had an actor play the part of the pilot.
Don't buy it.",1447286400,8,1215,4.990049751243781
8662776,5,B00KZ1WD6S,"I watched this movie on the NG Channel and enjoyed it so much I'm going to buy it. Would have wanted a more in depth profile of the pilot, but understand the recognition for his heroic actions came later. Highly recommended.",1413590400,3,224,4.487804878048781
8662777,5,B00KZ1WD6S,"I'm not much for watching reenactments, but knowing the ending made it worth while. Having been in a few rough circumstances myself, I found a number of lessons to learn from this catastrophic episode.

The addition of the actual passengers, most of the flight crew, and the rescuers gave some good perspectives, rather than having a writer fill in the blanks with ""originality"".",1403654400,3,379,5.015873015873016
