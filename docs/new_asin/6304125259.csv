8571700,5,6304125259,"As a certified self defense instructor I whole heartly recommend the Keyeye video tape for child safety. We are planning on using this tape as a foundation for a child safety program in our community. The tape teaches kids how to use the most effective self defense weapon, THEIR BRAIN! We cannot protect our kids 24/7, no matter how hard we try. Use this tape, and talk with your kids about abduction & sexual abuse. Communication, It's the only way we will ever stop the nightmare. If we save ""only one"" it it not worth our time?  Sure some of the acting is a little ""corny"", but they make their point straight & true. It's also done in an a way that well not only educate, but amuse you as well.  If you care about your kids, buy this tape. Sit down and watch it together as a family. I am betting your kids will not be the only ones to learn something.  Thanks",972000000,,864,4.2560975609756095
