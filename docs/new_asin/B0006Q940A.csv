2191296,5,B0006Q940A,"My 16 month old daughter is not supposed to watch anything, so critics and doctors say, but she is absolutely in love with Jo Jo and Goliath. She doesn't watch television, and doesn't have the desire to, from what it seems like, but she wakes up talking about Jo Jo all the time. Great video!",1123113600,3,292,4.327272727272727
2191297,4,B0006Q940A,My 2 year old daughter absolutely loves both this Jo Jo video and the take a bow one as well.,1122940800,,93,3.7
2191298,5,B0006Q940A,"My daughter loves this movie. It has four episodes, plus a bonus Higgleytown Hereos. If your child is under 6 and has access to the Disney Channel this means a lot to you.  The songs are catchy and the messages are good.  I have seen this DVD about- oh a million times- and it is still watchable.  I would recommend this to any parent with children under 7.",1120521600,13,357,4.220588235294118
2191299,5,B0006Q940A,My daughter loves JoJo and I was so happy I was able to get her this replacement for her old one that started to skip.  This one came quickly and the price was reasonable,1391990400,,170,4.0

2191301,5,B0006Q940A,Jojo's circus was one of my grandson's favorite shows but it wasn't on tv when he wanted to watch it so bought him the video.,1375228800,,125,4.04
2191302,4,B0006Q940A,This is a very great series for children. My son loves to watch this on Disney junior and was very ecstatic to receive this in the mail. It came very quickly.,1372032000,,158,4.129032258064516
2191303,5,B0006Q940A,"Yes, lots of dancing and fun to spur on imaginative little minds!
My 3 yr old dances along to the ""snake dance"".",1369872000,,112,4.136363636363637
2191304,3,B0006Q940A,"If your kids like Jojo's circus then it's great...I personally can't stand them. But, I must say that the color is great and at least the character doesn't have an annoying voice like others i've come across.",1362528000,,208,4.648648648648648

2191306,5,B0006Q940A,"I'm just so upset that there're a total of just two DVDs in this series, the present one and ""Take a Bow."" Great voice acting, lovely animation, and fun and wholesome themes make Jojo's Circus one of the best video programs for young kids. I just don't understand why Disney stopped making these. I'm sure if they had gone to Steve Jobs, one of Disney's board members, and begged him to donate some money to support children's programs, he might have helped. But then, maybe not, given he didn't even want to support his own illegit children. I digress, and may he RIP! My kids love Jojo's Circus and we all wish there had been more.",1344211200,,633,4.4655172413793105
2191307,5,B0006Q940A,I really enjoyed watching this with my child. I own the Animal Go Go and The Take A Bow dvd if any one is debating which one is better. I think The Animal Go Go is better of the two.,1315353600,,182,3.575
2191308,5,B0006Q940A,"We bought this for our almost-3 year-old daughter.  She immediately fell in love with it on the first viewing, and it has become one of her favorites.  I appreciate that there's honestly nothing in this video that I have to censor for toddler eyes and ears.  The characters are cute and respectful toward one another, the songs are catchy but not annoying, and the lessons are really useful.  This particular DVD teaches things like listening to instructions and taking care of your teeth, among others.

My husband and I both like it, too.  I mean, we aren't watching it on our own when the kid's not around.  But when she does watch it, it's entertaining for us.  We appreciate the gentle humor (like the farmer clown who raises rubber chickens, or JoJo's mom growing squirting flowers in the back yard).  It seems to have high production values, too.  The art is really bright and engaging, and nicely animated, and the voice work is really well-done--not like some other children's videos where kid voices are obviously adult voices trying to sound cute.

It's just a really nice program that I would gladly buy again.  I look forward to seeing more.",1290124800,,1154,4.743718592964824

2191311,5,B0006Q940A,I purchased this DVD for my niece for her birthday.  She loves clowns especially Jojo.  The DVD arrived quickly and my niece loved it.  This is a great DVD for kids.,1246752000,,165,4.258064516129032
2191312,5,B0006Q940A,My 2 year old Daughter LOVES THIS SHOW and everything about it! We were in the car one time and she was throwing a major fit and the only way to get her to quiet down was singing the Snake Dance song from Jo Jo's circus! We also own the CD songs too! This Movie has saved my life and Entertained my child FOR HOURS!!!!!!! :) IT'S DEFINATELY WORTH SPENDING $ ON!,1244937600,,361,4.027777777777778
2191313,5,B0006Q940A,"My 2 year old daughter Emerson absolutely loves JoJo.  It started when she saw JoJo on Playhouse Disney's ""Feeling Good with JoJo"" 5 minute short series. So, my husband and I decided to purchase her a few DVD's we could keep on hand at home.  We are glad we did!  She loves this DVD as well as ""Take A Bow"".  I find her imitating the various animal movements and dancing to and singing along with all of the songs.  She even does this after the DVD has ended.  It is the cutest thing!  If you are looking for a DVD that keeps your child ""active"" throughout and not just staring into space, then I highly recommend this.",1220745600,,619,4.239316239316239
2191314,5,B0006Q940A,"I love JoJo!  It's cute, hip and fun.  My daughter has been grinning at her from day one.

2191316,5,B0006Q940A,"My 3 year old cannot get enough of JoJo.  I had a hard time finding any videos in the store and when I found this, I was thrilled! She wants to watch it all day every day.  I can't complain, JoJo is a good role model and teaches as she entertains.",1186617600,,247,3.823529411764706
2191317,5,B0006Q940A,"I've owned this movie for two weeks, and I would guess we've seen it over 30 times. My 2 year old daughter loves it and begs to see it constantly. Then, as soon as it is over, she begs to see it again.",1168473600,,201,3.697674418604651
2191318,4,B0006Q940A,"My 2 year old daughter loves Jojo's circus like crazy. So I bought this DVD for her.  The only disappointment is that this is actually just a collection of the ones shown on Playhouse Disney on TV (although I haven't seen part of it). With that sad, my daughter never gets tired of it and we can just play it again and again. And she has learned alot from it (new vocabulary, jumping and dancing etc).

Great DVD and we are going to get the other Jojo DVD",1168300800,,455,4.159090909090909
2191319,5,B0006Q940A,"We have two Jojo DVD's- this one and Take a Bow. Our girls love both and so do we. Jojo has the cutest songs and gets your children involved with body movements. If your child likes Jojo, definetly buy the DVD.",1167782400,,210,4.146341463414634
2191320,5,B0006Q940A,"I rented this DVD from our local library and my 2-year old loved it!  I enjoy it as well--the colors, characters, and music are excellent.  I also appreciate that each episode tries to teach a good life lesson.  My toddler is a bit upset that we had to return the DVD to the library--I guess that means I'll be purchasing it very soon.

Oh, and sometimes the songs are a bit too catchy.  I often find the tooth brushing song (""Brush your teeth, little lion.  Brush your teeth."" on continuous replay in my mind.",1161475200,3,510,4.372340425531915
2191321,5,B0006Q940A,"We bought this for our [...] daughter - she loves it!  Mommy and Daddy love it too!  We found she is now more eager to brush her teeth, just like Jo-Jo and we also change the wording and sing ""Go to bed, little Lion""  & ""Go take a bath, little Lion"" etc. and it makes other ""chores"" seem fun to her!

We also like it because they incorporate a cute song asking Jo-Jo what she learned during the day ie:  listening to Mommy & Daddy, etc.",1154908800,,436,4.023255813953488
2191322,5,B0006Q940A,My 2 year old daughter is totally into Jojo and her friends. This DVD didn't let us down. It's been nice to take Jojo along on our trips and put it in our portable DVD player. This DVD has saved us many times!,1154736000,,209,3.883720930232558

He still calls Jojo when he wakes up or when he is brushing his teeth. It is an adorable clown, ideal for this age...",1142294400,,343,3.8450704225352115

2191325,5,B0006Q940A,"My 2yr old loves JoJo because she has songs in every episode and does different actions to each song. This is an adorable DVD and each episode features some sort of animal. It has one with Goliath brushing his teeth, a farm episode and others. My daughter will watch this many times over (and we can't brush teeth without singing Goliath's brush your teeth song now).",1129507200,11,367,4.575757575757576
2191326,5,B0006Q940A,"My 17 month old son loves Jo-Jo and Goliath.  This dvd contains ""flower shower"" ""uncle flippy's funny farm"" ""try these on for boing"" and ""brushing up"".  The cartoons are cute with good messages for children but are not too overly sappy like Emily Elizabeth and Clifford the Big Red Dog.  Jo-Jo's Circus is also good because there's a lot of music, dancing and singing that your little one can follow along to.",1126483200,10,409,4.652777777777778
2191327,5,B0006Q940A,"Since our almost 2 year old granddaughter has shown some interest in watching Jo Jo's Circus on TV,we bought this DVD for her. She has watched one to two of the four episodes on this DVD,but still likes Dora the best. I think Jo Jo looks and sounds more like a boy than a girl,though.[...]",1125964800,,289,4.2727272727272725

I ordered these on the evening of the 10th and received them on the 13th (which was a Sunday!!!!)  I opened the box and let her take out the goods and her eyes lit up and immediately said ""open mama!""
