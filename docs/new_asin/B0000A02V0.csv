7994717,3,B0000A02V0,"First things first: only one of the three movies on this DVD (""The Young Master"") actually stars Jackie Chan. The others where either had action choreography done by him (""36 Crazy Fists"") or have a short cameo (""Fantasy Mission Force."")
""Young Master"" is an enjoyable movie, similar in tone and style to his relatively early ""Drunken Master"" period. The first half has its lulls, but the second half picks up with some terrific action and comedy.
""36 Crazy Fists"" actually has footage of Jackie doing choreography tacked on at the beginning, adding sleaziness to this hilariously bad epic. Obviously intended as a rip-off of ""Drunken Master,"" this is truly awful, but it's entertaining in an odd sort of way.
Chan apparantly did ""Fantasy Mission Force"" as a favour to Jimmy Wang-Yu, who helped get him out of a contract. This is a completely wild, insane movie, full of Amazon women, odd references to American movies, a singing hobo, and even vampires! It's wonderfully stupid in every conceivable way, although, truth be told, the final battle between Jimmy Wang-Yu and Chan is relatively exciting.
Like most DVDs that try to cram three movies on them, this looks pretty atrocious. ""Fantasy Mission Force"" and ""36 Crazy Fists"" are both panned-and-scanned, and they look very claustrophobic. ""Young Master"" is in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, making it the best looking of the bunch. It still, however, looks smeary, faded, and fuzzy. As an extra feature, there is an average Jackie Chan biography, as well as some ""film facts"" in the form of liner notes.",1090713600,22,1561,4.984674329501916
7994718,3,B0000A02V0,"Okay, first of all, I was tricked by packaging when I first started my Jackie Chan collection. Trying to own every movie he's ever made in the shortest amount of time (I have since learned better), I bought 36 Crazy Fists because it touted Jackie as actually being in the film. NO! Jackie is NOT in the film, he was the action coordinator. Do not fall into the trap I fell into. The main actor, though, Tony Leung Kar Fai, I believe, did act rather Jackie-esque in the comedy department and the stamp of Jackie is vaguely on the film, but he's not in it. As for Fantasy Mission Force- well, in Jackie's own words about the premise: ""If it sounds ridiculous, that's because it IS."" He did the movie a favor to someone who had helped him out. Big mess that included the Triad. Yes, this is one of those movies Jackie would rather not have you see nor really admit he's been in. He shows up halfway through the film and somehow turns into the hero of the film, even though he's an overalled bumpkin. But he knows how to fight! There are Nazis, vampires and zombies, I think. It was all very confusing. You'd be better off injecting LSD directly into your eyeballs; you'd get the same effect. Horrible, awful movie. So do Jackie a favor, learn from my mistakes and wasted money and just skip this one altogether. Of course, if you're doing what I'm doing, which is to collect ALL his movies no matter how crappy they are, then you'll eventually have to bite the bullet and this to your collection. Hold off as long as possible. As for Young Master... well, that one was really good. I definitely recommend Young Master. Some great action in that one. Also features Yuen Biao. Vintage Jackie. **Three stars ONLY because Young Master in included**",1085011200,15,1741,4.495268138801261
