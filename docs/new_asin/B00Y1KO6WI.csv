8717379,5,B00Y1KO6WI,Great edition to The Ring and The Grudge collections.  A much needed return to scary Sadako after the Sadako 1 & 2 with its little girl and mutant sadakos.  In this two friends watch the cursed tape.  When they finally resort to professional help against Sadako the medium decides they must visit the cursed Grudge house.  The only way to survive is to pit Sadako against Kayako.  Absolutely incredible ending.  I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!,1481846400,,430,4.821917808219178
