Now he is obsessed with anything blue angels.

This video as another reviewer noted is very technical for a 3 year old- but my son doesn't find it boring or frustrating. When I took him to an air and space museum recently I was shocked at how much he had absorbed from the  video and he was so excited to tell me all the knowledge he knew about the different air planes.",1294876800,,514,4.34375
8058284,3,B0009836UE,"... though a good DVD. Just wasn't the top selection out of the three bought for Christmas. Maybe if they didn't stray off the path too much, i.e. not put so much in.",1231718400,,166,4.0606060606060606
8058285,5,B0009836UE,"Last Christmas, we bought our Grandson the Firefighter George Firetruck series because he loves firetrucks. He hasn't stopped watching them, so we were encouraged to ""please buy something different so we can stop watching this video""! I figured we would get the same result with the firefighter Airplanes and we were right on. We also purchased one of the train series with the same results.

These videos are not only quirky and high energy for a child's attention, they are extemely educational. If your child loves airplanes, this is a must for you.",1231200000,,552,4.935483870967742
8058286,5,B0009836UE,"My 4 1/2 year old son loves this video, there is action, children, a lively commentary and lots of information.  The safety features are a true bonus.  enjoy.",1218931200,,158,4.607142857142857
8058287,5,B0009836UE,"My grandchildren LOVED this DVD.  They are 7, 6, and three four year olds.  Each of them, boys and girls, sit captivated by the Blue Angels and stunt pilot and, especially, the evacuation from a Delta plane into the water. They are mesmerized by all of the action.  I liked the way safety for the children is highlighted and the fact that Firefighter George emphasizes diversity.  He shows women in traditional men's roles, as well as having blacks and whites in both the child actors and those in leadership positions.  You'll be very glad you bought this DVD for your children and grandchildren...I sure am!  Over 40 minutes of peace every day since it arrived...and they continue begging me to let them watch it again and again.",1118534400,12,731,4.716535433070866
