8494252,5,B00670ZGKQ,"I am a fan of Hyun Bin.  He is a great actor and definitely carried the role in this drama, strong where he had to be while being patient and loving in dealing with a bratty and priveledged young women whose character at times was beyond annoying until he broke down all barriers.",1427241600,,280,4.283018867924528
8494253,5,B00670ZGKQ,This is a very poignant story with excellent acting by Hyung Bin and Sung Yu-Ri.  Both actors received the KBS awards for best actor and actress for their work in this drama.  They also received an award for Best Couple in a drama.  The story is based on a classic story by Hans Christian Andersen and adapted very well for this drama.  Well worth seeing.,1390262400,,355,4.415384615384616
