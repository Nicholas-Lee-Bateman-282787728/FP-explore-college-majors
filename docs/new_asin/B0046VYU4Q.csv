8417492,5,B0046VYU4Q,"Excellent DVD its in three parts. The first is stocking your pantry, second beans and grains and third salads. Be warned after you watch the first section credits roll for the film, I thought it was over. After the credits it takes you back to the main menu so you can pick sections two and three. The DVD content was excellent as was the chef. The chef gave a lot of VERY helpful tips from using a food processor to how to thicken salad dressings.",1461801600,,448,4.2823529411764705
