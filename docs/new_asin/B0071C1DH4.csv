5047281,5,B0071C1DH4,"Now I normally do not get all excited about a. . . documentary. At all. But this was one that's really been long in coming for those who are part of the Broken Hearts Club.

If you have an hour, and want to know more about the gay community, and why it's so difficult to find a date, or be in a monogamous, long-term relationship; why gay men  have been so shallow, or even why it's just so difficult to connect with others (besides the fact that they're shallow), this will probably give you a lot of answers to those questions.

All in all, it's really refreshing to see purely gay men being open and honest about the long-term relationship scene in the gay world, and providing the answers to help correct that. (I was also surprised by some of the statistics they have, such as only 1/3 - 1/2 of gay men are in relationships, and only 50% in relationships are monogamous.)

If you're looking to better your life, or your prospects for finding Mr. Right, then I highly recommend this video.

It's only an hour, but it's got a strong yet very relaxed message, and I think everyone should watch it.

(And there's tons of eye candy, too!)",1381968000,10,1138,4.395238095238096
5047282,4,B0071C1DH4,"I commend the producers and willing participants in this ""how-to"" guide to healthy gay/lesbian relationships. The emphasis here is on gay men, but the principles of finding and working-out relationships of all kinds, are the same regardless of the coupled gender mix. I really appreciated the emphasis here on the analysis part of gay male relationships. The film spends time analyzing why gay men in relationships often fail. It is partly gender, partly psychosocial. Nonetheless, the primary message that cannot be overemphasized and which the film's therapists and participants repeat is: ""KNOW THYSELF."" It won't be easy work, but know yourself and be aware of the impact that growing-up being rejected and judged has had on your self-esteem and value as a human being. While there are other layers that affect an individual's development (i.e., political and cultural matters), familial dysfunction is probably the primary influence and the most convoluted and challenging to 'unpack'. Familial dysfunction is the norm in American families (and international families also). The PBS popular family psychologist, John Bradshaw (not in this film) once commented that 98% of American families are dysfunctional and the other 2% are in denial, in other words, you are not alone. In the case of families with gay children, the dysfunction may increase exponentially (or so it seems) and impacts the gay individual in ways that are delayed in terms of their emergence and the ability of the individual to confront the issues. My own belief is that the damage of familial dysfunction never goes away--the pain, with all of the attendant symptoms (e.g., broken relationships, isolation, addiction, etc.) will emerge unless the individual goes through intense therapy either on their own or with the help of a licensed professional. The individual must be aware of this and how it could impact any potentially long-term committed relationship. Given that the familial dysfunction (in my opinion) never goes away, the individual must seek healthy ways to find solace and comfort. A long-term relationship, may be a means of providing that solace and comfort, HOWEVER, both individuals need to be aware of each other's history and know that it is going to be serious work. If the two people involved are not aware of the dysfunction in each other's past, the relationship could be tantamount to a co-dependency, in which the two individuals do NOT provide validation, support, sympathy and love, but only judgment, criticism, blame and discomfort. In this latter instance, the relationship is no better than drug addiction, alcoholism, sociopathic sabotage, eating disorders, etc., etc. None of these provide the healthy solace and comfort dysfunctional individuals need. Younger gay individuals rarely appreciate this important step and find themselves going from partner to partner, thinking they want a relationship of substance, but unaware of the ways to begin the process. This film posits that the process starts with the individual. Know yourself. Get therapy, if you need it, but do not inflict yourself on anyone else till you've fully vetted your familial history and your past and the impact it is having and will have on all your life, including your relationships.",1380672000,11,3272,5.2942307692307695
5047283,5,B0071C1DH4,"This documentary reminded me of the 80's classic teen movie, ""The Breakfast Club"" but with less neon and more gayer.  Also, no one put lipstick on with there breasts.  It portrayed different personality types and their struggle to find love in a not so accepting world.  Just like the struggle a lot of us had with our identities in high school and the ""gay-world"" can sometimes seem like never-ending High School.  You have the never-satisfied ""princess"", the self-defeating ""jock"", the buckle-under-pressure ""geek"", the rebellious ""rebel"", and the self-explanatory ""freak"".

5047284,5,B0071C1DH4,I thought this documentary was very relevant especially for myself who was brought up in a time when little was discussed about gay relationships let alone how one's development as a child and youth affected these relationships as an adult.

What the film would have benefited from was comments from older gay men who could offer their lived experiences.  This is the problem with gay culture in general; it's focused on the pretty young thing.  (I came out in my early 20s and believe me, the years have flown by so fast so that now I still am a single, gay man of 60 who isn't looked at twice very often and who could've used some kind of ""gay education"" on love! Now, I think it is true that youth is wasted on the young.) <<sigh>> To all you younger men, remember that ""life isn't a dress rehearsal""!

5047320,3,B0071C1DH4,"PROs
(Most are common sense)

Match expectations with reality;
We all look for someone who we feel is just a little bit out of our reach because that is where attraction starts;
Be flexible in what you are looking for;
Look past the physical if you want it to last (DUH!);
Make yourself happy first and be who you are;
Avoid at all costs, criticism, defensiveness, contempt or talking down to someone or name-calling, and stone-walling that is an act of aggression;
Work on your friendship and on staying connected;
Co-create.

One comment made was ""Loving someone means taking on their problems in addition to your own."" I think it is important to add don't become codependent; that is, don't look to your partner to ""fix"" you and don't try to ""fix"" your partner. Accept each other as is.

I liked learning about the couple at the end who described how they ""opened"" their relationship but realized that was not going to work because one of them noticed that the other was becoming more intimate with others in addition to just having sex so they decided to stop the ""open"" relationship.

I also liked how they realize that arguments are ok as long as no one placed blame on the other and ""You have to have a willingness to be hurt and be there for one another when it gets ugly.""

CONS

Watch the first 10 minutes and skip to the last 20 minutes because:
What on earth does a description of hookup sites like Grindr and Manhunt have to do with finding REAL love?
Way too much attention is given to facebook and other online sites and ""sending messages to 100 strangers in hopes of receiving 10 replies, one of whom MIGHT turn out to be ""the one;""
The USA of ANT guy says that ""usually the flamboyant guys are looking for the ones that are masculine."" Blatant generalizations like that need to be edited out.

True that you have to be aware of how your past influences your behavior but way too much time was spent on coming out struggles, growing up gay, family history, church hell, suicide attempts, getting a therapist and take several sessions to deal with ""baggage.""  Be very careful in choosing a therapist who concentrates NOT on wallowing in your past from week to week but relays to you the tools to live in the present and be true to your feelings. A therapist who helps you learn good coping strategies so that when you get dumped you do not internalize it; realize it is more about them than you and do your best to learn from it and move on.

I workout too but throwing just a few ""average"" guys into numerous clips of buff, mostly muscular and hairy bodies partying detracts from the topic of ""Finding Love.""

Finally, scattered throughout are subtle mentions of the interviewed therapist's book titles and even the producer's dating website that does not exist. If I wanted a book, I would have bought one.",1399680000,7,2823,4.550295857988166
