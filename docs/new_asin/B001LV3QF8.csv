8319866,5,B001LV3QF8,"I heard about Dr. Effie Chow from a podcast by Dr. Nieters, ""The Balancing Point"", to which I have been listening for several years and which I highly recommend also.  Dr. Chow has quite a long and extensive career in health care in geneneral and Qigong in particular.  The thing about Qi Gong is that, especially for the beginner, it is important to have a live instructor.  That said, these videos together with her book are the next best thing.  If one has some experience with any form of physical culture, (martial arts, Tai Chi, Yoga etc...), then one will hopefully appreciate and pay attention to the safety tips interspersed throughout the methodical, easy-to understand, guided instruction.  Another thing about Qi Gong is that there are some that can actually be dangerous if one is just embarking on a study.  The most dangerous are the internal forms which are only for the more advanced student.  That is another reason why the Dr. Chow Qigong healing system is so good.  I have found it to be safe and effective in that its internal componant is really there but secondary to the learning of the external forms presented, so that only the benefits are gained.  If you live in California and can visit her and study with her I envy you.  I am stuck out East in NYC so haven't had the personal instruction yet although benefiting from the practice alone.  I plan to study with her the first chance I get.",1401148800,5,1417,4.628

Effie Chow is one of the leading alternative healers in the world, as well as an award winning doctor, and Qigong Master. I was really happy to finally get her videos, and the book which she co-authored with Charles McGee; ""Miracle Healing from China-Qigong"". The book and DVDs are available from Amazon. In addition, Dr Chow also has a Qigong meditation CD which isn't available through Amazon, but can be purchased through a link on her site which is the East West Academy for the Healing Arts - [...]

I became interested in Dr Chow after fracturing my spine and suffering from severe chronic pain, as well as being diagnosed with fibromalgia and chronic fatigue. I believe the latter stem from numerous accidents over the years. My body finally said enough is enough! When western medicine didn't offer any real and long lasting relief, I turned to alternative methods of pain relief. Combining the two - Eastern and Western medicine has been much more helpful in relieving pain.

Dr Chow and the East West Academy offer many intensive programs to learn their Qigong method of healing as well as shorter classes and seminars for those who would like to learn how to heal themselves. The more intensive 100 or 400 hour program is for anyone who would like to learn the complete method, but mostly for people who are learning to become Qigong healers themselves. Dr Chow teaches throughout the world each year and also offers private consultations at the East West Academy in San Francisco.

Chow Qigong is a powerful system where one can learn techniques of health assessment using energy concepts, skills in touch healing, acupressure, energy manipulation, traditional Chinese massage, relaxation skills, as well as Qigong exercises which boost your Qi in order to maximize stamina, wellness, and disease prevention. The above is augmented by methods of visualization and meditation specially developed by Dr Chow.

Dr Chow's 100 hour training program is an integral component of a more extensive 400 hour training course. Dr. Chow's training program is based on the model developed at the East West Academy of Healing Arts by Dr. Chow with the cooperation of the University of California, San Francisco Extension, Division of Nursing Continuing Education. It has been implemented in Kalispel, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Seatle, Spokane, Washington D.C. and the Canadian cities of Edmonton, Vancouver, Ottawa, Toronto, and Waterloo, as well as many other areas. Dr. Chow combines the ancient and modern, Eastern and Western theories and practices, as well as her own original theories and practices utilizing Energy Principles. The Chow Integrated Healing System is dynamically effective, as well as cost effective.

Dr Chow was a Presidential Appointee to the White House Commission on
Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy. She's had 40 years of Qigong and TCM training and practice. In addition, she also has a Ph. D. and a Masters in behavioral sciences and communication, as well as being a skilled acupuncturist, and public health and psychiatric nurse",1235174400,10,3157,5.108527131782946
