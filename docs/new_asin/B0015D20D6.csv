3143679,3,B0015D20D6,"It is not often that a high quality film production comes through the Cajun country to capture the scenery and locale so eloquently. Filming locations were around Little Chenier and numerous parishes surrounding. The absence of destruction is because the film was made just prior to Hurricane Rita. There is no link for the Blu Ray title of this so I will mention it briefly.

The Blu looks incredible for the scenery and vegetation captures. Every time a boat goes through the water channels everything looks so flawless. No special features are included and the sound was mixed down to 2.0. The DVD is worth the purchase for local fans though.

The story is quite simple yet manages to convey a sense of importance for the players involved. A tale of love, betrayal, tragic death and intertwined stories while the simple life passes by in the Cajun country. Two brothers ebb their existence by selling fish bait from their small dock, whilst being watched by the local sheriff for crimes they may or may not have committed. Their best friend, played by Clifton Collins (who is awesome in Dirty - a must see for fans of his) adds the slightly comedic element and semi-protector of the group. Lines are crossed, beautiful topography imagery is interlaced, and locals get their 15 minutes. Performances are forced and the accents slip quite often, but the background is what holds it together.

If you live outside the filming area, this film would still be worth the watch just for the scenery. The DVD has a few deleted scenes and a drastically different alternate ending. Another selling point would have to be the music options. They have transferable songs from the DVD and extra cuts from other artists for download to your computer. The movie is listed online as 120 minutes, but the running time is 100 (110 with deleted) so not sure what was cut.

Be sure to watch the pics of where they filmed immediately followed by a shot of the after effects of Rita - heartbreaking (just prior to credits). Speaking of credits, they are very detailed - and more representative of filming spots than I have seen in any other listings. I wish all films were that precise, kudos to the locals who got their boats and homes listed by name.",1215129600,22,2232,4.7153846153846155
3143680,5,B0015D20D6,I saw this movie at Lake Charles Cinemark 3 tims.  I just couldn't get enough of it! I cried and I laughed! It is amazing to have a movie filmed from where you are from.

I'm not sure someone who isn't familiar with the Cajun way of life would understand it. But we enjoyed it. It's a low quality ""B"" movie, but cute.",1438819200,2,312,4.491228070175438
3143701,1,B0015D20D6,"After reading the superb reviews, I decided to give this film a shot as I came across it when looking for a Blu-Ray copy of ""Of Mice and Men'. Oddly enough, this film is a direct rip off of the film and a poorly executed one at that. I have no idea how this film has the amount of 4+ star reviews it has other than the production company must've paid people or had their family members write them as this film was just horrible. Visually it was beautiful however, everything from the acting, writing and dialogue was just bad. This film was as slow as molasses, boring beyond belief and the direction was just bizarre as the film consisted mostly of wide shots. Conceptually I can appreciate the effort in trying to re-imagine ""Of Mice and Men"" and giving it a Cajun theme by having it set in Louisiana, however it doesn't take long to realize why this film went straight to DVD. Most people more than likely haven't heard of this obscure film and may stumble across it such as I did. Nevertheless, try finding someone who owns it and borrow it instead of wasting your money. You may find it worth your time if you watch it for free however, if you actually paid for it, well I'm sure it will end up in your personal stack of neglected DVD's.",1427673600,,1242,4.334763948497854

3143704,5,B0015D20D6,"This was a powerful story and the acting was superb.  Having lived in Louisiana for several years, many of the scenes here are very reminiscent of what I remember of the Cajun community.  For example, it is very common to hear both American English and Cajun French being intermixed during a conversation.  One of the things I really appreciated about the movie is that, except for Chris Mulkey, I was unfamiliar with any of the other actors; that made it even more believable to hear them speaking as Cajuns speak.  Another thing about this movie that I really appreciate is that it would be a perfect movie to watch after watching another great movie about the Cajun people--""Belizaire the Cajun"".  That movie gives a wonderfully insightful historical look at the Cajun community in Louisiana in the 1800's, while ""Little Chenier"" is a modern look at that community.  I cannot recommend a movie any more highly than I do this one, but it does make me regret that ""Belizaire the Cajun"" is so difficult to locate these days.  That movie should be re-released, and these two sold together.  Oh, and I could not finish this review without noting the incredible job that Fred Koehler did as Pemon in ""Little Chenier"".  His potrayal of Beaux's younger brother is brilliant!  Note, also, that the subtitle is only slightly misleading--the ""story"", or plot of the movie, could be cast in any setting; it is not a ""Cajun"" plot per se.  However, it is set within the Cajun community and within that context, it is very ""Cajun"".",1418601600,2,1519,4.759541984732825
3143705,5,B0015D20D6,"I absolutely LOVED this movie. It is cute, funny, sad and has a great story line. The acting in awesome.

3143714,5,B0015D20D6,Great movie! The actors did an amazing job even though they're not from La. It gives you a taste of the REAL country side of Louisiana instead of that drawn out over exaggerated movie set in N'awlins.,1373846400,,200,4.4324324324324325
3143715,4,B0015D20D6,"An engaging story about two brothers: the strong, elder big brother taking care of his mentally-challenged younger brother while their alcoholic, woman-chasing father takes off for long stretches of time.  Beau has carved out a simple yet good life for Pemon and himself, selling bait out of the back of their pier.  Throw in his best friend, T-Boy, who wears a sidearm and wrestles alligators; a sympathetic sheriff and his envious son (who has stolen away Beau's girl and married her) and you have one atmospheric swamp tale that entertains over and over again.  Repeated viewings draw you even closer to the characters' meanings and intentions.  This IS the definition of a true sleeper film.  I'm a northerner who has a deep affinity and affection for the South and I've seen this film approximately 20X and have not grown tired of it.  When you walk away after viewing this film, you will have felt that you have spent time in the bayou with truly, original characters.  In it's own humble, straightforward approach, this film is so much better than any pablum Hollywood churns out on a monthly basis.  All the actors, too many to mention, are wonderful in their own roles as if they were hand-picked.  Jace Johnson (co-writer, actor) and Bethany Ashton (co-writer and director) deserve the most credit.  It's obvious they are close to the subject of life on the bayou and their story is proof because they deliver the goods.  The soundtrack is a perfect fit, Lucinda Williams, nuff said. I'm watching it again today, my wife loves the film also.

My heart goes out to the people who actually lived there.  Three weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana, Hurricane Rita hit the city of Lake Charles and the various parishes used for filming. All of the sets and locations used in the film were destroyed, leaving many locals homeless. The film is believed to be the only known footage of the area. Director, Bethany Ashton and her family set up a non-profit organization called Rita Remembered to rebuild the communities and help those in need, who were largely left out of the eventual help offered to victims of Katrina. The charity is unique in that Ashton and the fellow creators invite people to correspond directly with them to find out exactly how their contributions were used. Bethany Ashton is a special woman who made a special film with a heart, soul and a pulse.  Don't miss this one...",1362268800,,2407,4.810679611650485
3143716,5,B0015D20D6,the only problem i have with this movie is that it ends! i want to know what happens to the characters after. i wish this would of been a tv series or something because i feel that they could of done so much with them.,1361232000,,218,3.8666666666666667

3143718,5,B0015D20D6,"I received this as a gift and have to say I was intrigued because we live in this area of Louisiana. The families portrayed seemed a tad bit 'type cast', but all in all the story held our interest throughout. If you're looking for a 'different' form of entertainment than the normal 'Hollywood' style - give it a try!",1358035200,,317,4.389830508474576

3143720,5,B0015D20D6,"I bought this because I was looking for an interesting and different movie at a decent price, and because Tamara Braun (General Hospital) and Chris Mulkey (Twin Peaks) were in it. A success on all fronts! After only seeing Braun's GH role of Carly and Mulkey's Hank Jennings on TP, I was very surprised to see them play against those types, almost entirely opposite characters in both instances (Mulkey's sheriff is a hero and Braun's character is a meek anti-Carly, like the rest of the cast once or twice difficult to understand with a thick Cajun accent). The other actors I had never heard of, but now I want to see everything they're in, especially Johnathon Schaech and Clifton Collins, Jr.

The movie tells the tale of a man (Schaech) who basically raises his 20-year-old mentally handicapped brother (played by Frederick Koehler, so amazing that I actually wondered at times if the actor was handicapped; I remember him now from the final season of Lost so I know he's not). His past flame (Braun) is now married to the sheriff's son, who develops a fierce vendetta against Schaech's character and takes it out on the handicapped brother. This had potential to turn into clich with an evil cop and a love triangle, but the backdrop of Cajun country made me feel like I had never seen these characters or this story before, causing me to be on the edge of my seat as I watched, a truly unique feat.

I've read some of these other reviews, where they complained about the accents or how the movie unjustly depicts real life in Louisiana. Having only been in that state once, as a youth, I can't speak to that, although at one point I wanted to yell at a guy, ""Call them on your cellphone! Oh, wait...."" But suffice it to say, they sold me.

According to the box, the movie's Rated R for brief violence (gunplay and alligator wrestling), but there are also some instances of bad language and what the industry would call ""sensuality"" (not sex or nudity). Nothing to get into a twist over unless you're sensitive to those types of things.",1330214400,2,2042,4.619834710743802

This movie did a better job than most, although it would have worked better set in long-ago days.

However, the plot had all the elements of a good story - interesting characters, satisfying ending.

I especially liked the dedication. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina,the victims of Hurricane Rita (and now Ike) were all but overlooked.

Jonathan Shcech is more than exercising his acting chops. Seems he has decided to become a character actor instead of a ""pretty face"" who can act. Job well done. The relationship between Schech's character Bo and his brother Peboan was touching and done very well. One of the things I love about low budget ""regional"" films like this is they tend to concentrate on the characters more than the action, murders and sometimes even the story. Several characters were sympathetic, like Bo's best friend and the hooker , who fell for Peboan. Some of the stroy is a redo, but it was done very well. But the ending made up for any deficiencies.

3143740,5,B0015D20D6,"This movie is outstanding. It's a must-see. It's a must-own. It's a touching Cajun story that sings to the tune of ""Sling Blade"" and ""Of Mice and Men.""
It is truly amazing.

I think the most gripping part of it all is that none of what you see in the film exists any longer. The floating homes, the moss, the cypress, the nests of les gros bec - Rita took it all away. She took it away just one month after this film finished shooting. It could very well be the last footage anyone has of this sacred region before it was destroyed.

""Little Chenier: A Cajun Story"" offers a way for anyone to see what Cajun country used to be. It is also a fine example of who we are and how we live.

The story is superb. The film itself is a haunting reminder of this part of the bayou no more - this, the bayou we still love.",1217808000,6,812,4.031055900621118
3143741,5,B0015D20D6,"What makes me love this movie is that, unlike most movies today, this film actually tells a story.  How the lives in this small area are intertwined, and how each person's actions have such an effect on the others is beautifully portrayed.  I actually cared about these characters and their lives.  Maybe that is why it isn't an easy story to hear, especially if you watch the alternate ending, but it is so worth the time.  I'll buy this one because it is worth watching more than once, in part for the scenery, but also because there is so much there I'm guessing I'll find more if I watch it again.  Even if you're not up to buying this, at least put it at the top of your rental list.",1215907200,18,688,4.2615384615384615

I learned so much about the Cajun culture - about their passions and beliefs
The story is brilliantly written by Jace Johnson
It's a study of amazing characters, all totally believable, all totally real.
The acting by EVERYONE was superb
The ""fornication"" scene is one of the funniest and most well written pieces of dialog I have heard in a long time

No wonder Little Chenier won 15 major film festival awards

3378176,3,B0015D20D6,"It is not often that a high quality film production comes through the Cajun country to capture the scenery and locale so eloquently. Filming locations were around Little Chenier and numerous parishes surrounding. The absence of destruction is because the film was made just prior to Hurricane Rita. There is no link for the Blu Ray title of this so I will mention it briefly.

The Blu looks incredible for the scenery and vegetation captures. Every time a boat goes through the water channels everything looks so flawless. No special features are included and the sound was mixed down to 2.0. The DVD is worth the purchase for local fans though.

The story is quite simple yet manages to convey a sense of importance for the players involved. A tale of love, betrayal, tragic death and intertwined stories while the simple life passes by in the Cajun country. Two brothers ebb their existence by selling fish bait from their small dock, whilst being watched by the local sheriff for crimes they may or may not have committed. Their best friend, played by Clifton Collins (who is awesome in Dirty - a must see for fans of his) adds the slightly comedic element and semi-protector of the group. Lines are crossed, beautiful topography imagery is interlaced, and locals get their 15 minutes. Performances are forced and the accents slip quite often, but the background is what holds it together.

If you live outside the filming area, this film would still be worth the watch just for the scenery. The DVD has a few deleted scenes and a drastically different alternate ending. Another selling point would have to be the music options. They have transferable songs from the DVD and extra cuts from other artists for download to your computer. The movie is listed online as 120 minutes, but the running time is 100 (110 with deleted) so not sure what was cut.

Be sure to watch the pics of where they filmed immediately followed by a shot of the after effects of Rita - heartbreaking (just prior to credits). Speaking of credits, they are very detailed - and more representative of filming spots than I have seen in any other listings. I wish all films were that precise, kudos to the locals who got their boats and homes listed by name.",1215129600,22,2232,4.7153846153846155

3378198,1,B0015D20D6,"After reading the superb reviews, I decided to give this film a shot as I came across it when looking for a Blu-Ray copy of ""Of Mice and Men'. Oddly enough, this film is a direct rip off of the film and a poorly executed one at that. I have no idea how this film has the amount of 4+ star reviews it has other than the production company must've paid people or had their family members write them as this film was just horrible. Visually it was beautiful however, everything from the acting, writing and dialogue was just bad. This film was as slow as molasses, boring beyond belief and the direction was just bizarre as the film consisted mostly of wide shots. Conceptually I can appreciate the effort in trying to re-imagine ""Of Mice and Men"" and giving it a Cajun theme by having it set in Louisiana, however it doesn't take long to realize why this film went straight to DVD. Most people more than likely haven't heard of this obscure film and may stumble across it such as I did. Nevertheless, try finding someone who owns it and borrow it instead of wasting your money. You may find it worth your time if you watch it for free however, if you actually paid for it, well I'm sure it will end up in your personal stack of neglected DVD's.",1427673600,,1242,4.334763948497854

3378201,5,B0015D20D6,"This was a powerful story and the acting was superb.  Having lived in Louisiana for several years, many of the scenes here are very reminiscent of what I remember of the Cajun community.  For example, it is very common to hear both American English and Cajun French being intermixed during a conversation.  One of the things I really appreciated about the movie is that, except for Chris Mulkey, I was unfamiliar with any of the other actors; that made it even more believable to hear them speaking as Cajuns speak.  Another thing about this movie that I really appreciate is that it would be a perfect movie to watch after watching another great movie about the Cajun people--""Belizaire the Cajun"".  That movie gives a wonderfully insightful historical look at the Cajun community in Louisiana in the 1800's, while ""Little Chenier"" is a modern look at that community.  I cannot recommend a movie any more highly than I do this one, but it does make me regret that ""Belizaire the Cajun"" is so difficult to locate these days.  That movie should be re-released, and these two sold together.  Oh, and I could not finish this review without noting the incredible job that Fred Koehler did as Pemon in ""Little Chenier"".  His potrayal of Beaux's younger brother is brilliant!  Note, also, that the subtitle is only slightly misleading--the ""story"", or plot of the movie, could be cast in any setting; it is not a ""Cajun"" plot per se.  However, it is set within the Cajun community and within that context, it is very ""Cajun"".",1418601600,2,1519,4.759541984732825

3378212,4,B0015D20D6,"An engaging story about two brothers: the strong, elder big brother taking care of his mentally-challenged younger brother while their alcoholic, woman-chasing father takes off for long stretches of time.  Beau has carved out a simple yet good life for Pemon and himself, selling bait out of the back of their pier.  Throw in his best friend, T-Boy, who wears a sidearm and wrestles alligators; a sympathetic sheriff and his envious son (who has stolen away Beau's girl and married her) and you have one atmospheric swamp tale that entertains over and over again.  Repeated viewings draw you even closer to the characters' meanings and intentions.  This IS the definition of a true sleeper film.  I'm a northerner who has a deep affinity and affection for the South and I've seen this film approximately 20X and have not grown tired of it.  When you walk away after viewing this film, you will have felt that you have spent time in the bayou with truly, original characters.  In it's own humble, straightforward approach, this film is so much better than any pablum Hollywood churns out on a monthly basis.  All the actors, too many to mention, are wonderful in their own roles as if they were hand-picked.  Jace Johnson (co-writer, actor) and Bethany Ashton (co-writer and director) deserve the most credit.  It's obvious they are close to the subject of life on the bayou and their story is proof because they deliver the goods.  The soundtrack is a perfect fit, Lucinda Williams, nuff said. I'm watching it again today, my wife loves the film also.

My heart goes out to the people who actually lived there.  Three weeks after Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana, Hurricane Rita hit the city of Lake Charles and the various parishes used for filming. All of the sets and locations used in the film were destroyed, leaving many locals homeless. The film is believed to be the only known footage of the area. Director, Bethany Ashton and her family set up a non-profit organization called Rita Remembered to rebuild the communities and help those in need, who were largely left out of the eventual help offered to victims of Katrina. The charity is unique in that Ashton and the fellow creators invite people to correspond directly with them to find out exactly how their contributions were used.

3378217,5,B0015D20D6,"I bought this because I was looking for an interesting and different movie at a decent price, and because Tamara Braun (General Hospital) and Chris Mulkey (Twin Peaks) were in it. A success on all fronts! After only seeing Braun's GH role of Carly and Mulkey's Hank Jennings on TP, I was very surprised to see them play against those types, almost entirely opposite characters in both instances (Mulkey's sheriff is a hero and Braun's character is a meek anti-Carly, like the rest of the cast once or twice difficult to understand with a thick Cajun accent). The other actors I had never heard of, but now I want to see everything they're in, especially Johnathon Schaech and Clifton Collins, Jr.

The movie tells the tale of a man (Schaech) who basically raises his 20-year-old mentally handicapped brother (played by Frederick Koehler, so amazing that I actually wondered at times if the actor was handicapped; I remember him now from the final season of Lost so I know he's not). His past flame (Braun) is now married to the sheriff's son, who develops a fierce vendetta against Schaech's character and takes it out on the handicapped brother. This had potential to turn into clich with an evil cop and a love triangle, but the backdrop of Cajun country made me feel like I had never seen these characters or this story before, causing me to be on the edge of my seat as I watched, a truly unique feat.

I've read some of these other reviews, where they complained about the accents or how the movie unjustly depicts real life in Louisiana. Having only been in that state once, as a youth, I can't speak to that, although at one point I wanted to yell at a guy, ""Call them on your cellphone! Oh, wait...."" But suffice it to say, they sold me.

According to the box, the movie's Rated R for brief violence (gunplay and alligator wrestling), but there are also some instances of bad language and what the industry would call ""sensuality"" (not sex or nudity). Nothing to get into a twist over unless you're sensitive to those types of things.",1330214400,2,2042,4.619834710743802

However, the plot had all the elements of a good story - interesting characters, satisfying ending.

I especially liked the dedication. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina,the victims of Hurricane Rita (and now Ike) were all but overlooked.

3378232,3,B0015D20D6,"I only gave it 3  stars because so much of it was predictable. The ending was a welcome surprise that more than made up for it though. Jonathan Shcech is more than exercising his acting chops. Seems he has decided to become a character actor instead of a ""pretty face"" who can act. Job well done. The relationship between Schech's character Bo and his brother Peboan was touching and done very well. One of the things I love about low budget ""regional"" films like this is they tend to concentrate on the characters more than the action, murders and sometimes even the story. Several characters were sympathetic, like Bo's best friend and the hooker , who fell for Peboan. Some of the stroy is a redo, but it was done very well. But the ending made up for any deficiencies. I really give it a 3.5 stars. Worth the money.",1221955200,,819,4.46
3378233,5,B0015D20D6,I am from Southwest Louisiana where most of this movie was filmed.  I bought this movie for my husbands Grandmother.  She absolutly LOVED this movie.  The only thing is the accents were alitte off. Over all the movie has was very good.,1219881600,2,235,4.5476190476190474
3378234,5,B0015D20D6,Watch & form your own opinion. I'm biased since it's about town's I grew up around.,1218499200,2,83,4.25
3378235,5,B0015D20D6,"I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this film, considering I'm from Louisiana, where the movie was filmed.  It definitely tugs at your heart strings.  The story line was immaculate.  It teaches a lesson of how to treat and how not to treat those with mental challenges.  Just because someone is mentally challenged, does not mean that they can't experience all aspects of life like normal people.  Pemon's character portrays that very well.  Therefore, I suggest those that are interested, you have to watch this film.  Thank you.",1218412800,3,531,5.0344827586206895
3378236,1,B0015D20D6,"Having just seen this movie, I can only agree that the music is great and the scenery is fantastic! I love seeing anything shot in Louisiana. The story and the acting are what brought this movie way down... It's kind of like growing up and being told that two wrongs don't make a right. Accent is everything and too many times I thought to myself wow, that doesn't sound right. Having read other reviews, I realize this may go against the grain, but I can't ever reccomend this movie to a friend if I would want them to see southern Louisiana or a great movie.",1218240000,2,560,4.3428571428571425
3378237,5,B0015D20D6,"This movie is outstanding. It's a must-see. It's a must-own. It's a touching Cajun story that sings to the tune of ""Sling Blade"" and ""Of Mice and Men.""
It is truly amazing.

I think the most gripping part of it all is that none of what you see in the film exists any longer. The floating homes, the moss, the cypress, the nests of les gros bec - Rita took it all away. She took it away just one month after this film finished shooting. It could very well be the last footage anyone has of this sacred region before it was destroyed.

""Little Chenier: A Cajun Story"" offers a way for anyone to see what Cajun country used to be. It is also a fine example of who we are and how we live.

The story is superb. The film itself is a haunting reminder of this part of the bayou no more - this, the bayou we still love.",1217808000,6,812,4.031055900621118
3378238,5,B0015D20D6,"What makes me love this movie is that, unlike most movies today, this film actually tells a story.  How the lives in this small area are intertwined, and how each person's actions have such an effect on the others is beautifully portrayed.  I actually cared about these characters and their lives.  Maybe that is why it isn't an easy story to hear, especially if you watch the alternate ending, but it is so worth the time.  I'll buy this one because it is worth watching more than once, in part for the scenery, but also because there is so much there I'm guessing I'll find more if I watch it again.  Even if you're not up to buying this, at least put it at the top of your rental list.",1215907200,18,688,4.2615384615384615
3378239,5,B0015D20D6,"What a truly beautiful film
I learned so much about the Cajun culture - about their passions and beliefs
The story is brilliantly written by Jace Johnson
It's a study of amazing characters, all totally believable, all totally real.
The acting by EVERYONE was superb
The ""fornication"" scene is one of the funniest and most well written pieces of dialog I have heard in a long time
The scenery was breathtaking
As was the film itself
No wonder Little Chenier won 15 major film festival awards
Including 9 Best Picture awards
An absolute joy and pleasure to watch over and over again",1215648000,20,580,4.696078431372549

8258035,5,B0015D20D6,"I wish there was a better way for Amazon to sort reviews between the purchase experience and the product experience. Notice that many of the lower reviews relate to a purchase process, not to the movie itself. I mention this because this A CAJUN STORY is simply one of the best movies that I've ever seen, which is why I bought it to own forever. The acting, the plot twists, the cinematography, the music -- everything is exactly right. The depiction of Pimon Depuis by Fred Koehler is sweet, sad, touching and perfect -- a memorable performance in a movie full of spot-on acting. (Clifton Collins as T-Boy is also hard not to love.) Little Chenier has created a world drenched in watery, deep-South beauty that serves as a backdrop for human nature at its best and worst. Highly recommend! Be sure to watch until the very end -- the scene before and after Hurricane Rita is haunting.",1505260800,,885,4.6075949367088604

8258037,5,B0015D20D6,"In 2008 I was pregnant with my son and my daughter, husband and I were watching this movie went I went into labor and delivered him the next morning.  Fast forward to last week my daughter was pregnant with my first grand baby and we got this movie and watched it Wednesday night and she went into labor Thursday night and the baby was born Friday morning.  We love this movie, we are from Louisiana and the accents make us laugh and the plot is ok but I guess it has sentimental value for us.",1502668800,,493,4.178947368421053
8258038,3,B0015D20D6,"The product itself was amazing!!! I love this movie and this was the only place I could find it - even online! However, it was a difficult process to purchase it. I bought 2 copies going to 2 addresses; one for my mom and one for myself. I used the same card as payment and ordered them at the same time. I needed to update my card, and I did so. Several times. It finally took, or so I thought. Somehow it took payment for my mother's copy and she got hers no problem. However, my copy was cancelled because I ""hadn't updated payment"" even though I obviously had. I tried to reach out to customer service and got an extremely unhelpful reply that wasn't even polite. I re-ordered it anyway because I just could not find it anywhere lese but it was pretty silly for a site like Amazon to be so difficult and unhelpful.",1494892800,,818,4.25
