2983646,5,B000WMA754,"This is a rare collection for Browns fans. DVDs of Browns games are few and far between at best, so it's best to grab one when they come around.  This is a great set of games.

A 3-DVD set, each contains one game in its entirety.  They are:

DVD #1: 1980 Browns vs. Packers,10/19/80.
Dave Logan catches an amazing 46-yard touchdown pass to give the Cardiac Kids a win over the Green Bay Cheeseheads.

DVD #2: 1989 Browns vs. Steelers, 9/10/89.
The Browns destroy the Steelers 50 - 0 on Opening Day.

DVD #3: 2002 Browns vs. Falcons, 12/29/02.
William Green helps the Browns smack the Falcons 24 - 16, putting the Browns in the playoffs.

Brian Sipe is the quarterback on the first DVD, Bernie Kosar in the second.

If you've got a Browns fan in your house, this is the gift for them.",1197158400,19,783,4.3517241379310345

I was about to order it on December 9 when I realized that no matter which shipping option I chose, it could not be here before Christmas- even if I paid $40 to overnight it!  What?  It must be a problem with the store.  Do not choose this store if you need an item in any reasonable amount of time.

Also, I had to search several other websites to find out which games were on this set.  They might want to note that, as it's sort of important.  Chalk this lost sale up to not enough information and slow shipping.",1197158400,3,566,4.090909090909091

2983676,3,B000WMA754,"This is a warning as much as a review.  The 3rd disc in this set is NOT the 2002 Browns vs Falcons game, it is another copy of the route against the Steelers 1989.  It is labeled as the 2002 Falcons game but that's not what's recorded on the dvd.  So, you get 2 games on 3 discs.  Aside from that, if you do not have games in the old Browns Municipal Stadium and the Steelers Three Rivers Stadium, you may like this set. They are definitely nostalgia packed, for me, as I grew up with these older stadiums having seen them on TV sometimes every week during high school (1976-80).  I don't even mind seeing Pittsburgh getting routed, just love to see Three Rivers again.  But, I digress. The NFL is now releasing full-edit games for us to see, which are edited badly in some cases, and the quality control is obviously not good considering the botched 3rd disc in this set.  The Falcons 2002 game is part of the reason I bought the set (the rest was to see the old stadiums again).  The game footage is a little squibbly also in the Browns/Packers game 1980, the VHS was probably bad, but it gets better as it runs.  Not the greatest effort by the NFL.  I will try to return it and see if the Falcons game was included in later released sets (I doubt it).  Not sure if its worth the $$ or not.  Good Luck.
UPDATE TO THE ABOVE REVIEW: I sent back the set in hopes of getting the Falcons game, which would have made the set worth buying, and I actually got the entire set of three games on three discs!  So, if you get a bad set and do want this full set, try again at least once.  Also, at least screen each disc to be sure you got all three games.  My 2nd Steelers 1989 game was labeled Falcons 2002.  It sounds like there are various configurations of mistakes in the production of this set, so I think I got lucky on the first return (how would Amazon know if they are sending me a complete new set or not?).  I considered trying twice, if need be. Good Luck.",1324771200,,1960,4.156498673740053
2983677,5,B000WMA754,"i just got this set, and I love it! It's always great to see vintage NFL broadcasts, even of your rivals. I'm giving this to my father as a Christmas present (we collect Steeler games from the years they made the playoffs, regardless of score), and I'm sure he'll enjoy the gift, if not the result. (For those who may not know, the Browns crushed the Steelers 51-0 in the game featured here). Still, a worthwhile edition to any football fan's video library.",1291420800,3,457,4.518072289156627
2983689,2,B000WMA754,"OK I am a steelers fan so I think the drive, the fumble, and red right 88 should be on here. As well as the 1994 and 2002 playoffs vs the Steelers. LOL

Ok all kidding aside, most of the Browns greatest games happened before color tv. LOL. But I think the 1986 playoff vs the Jets should be on here. 1987 playoff vs Colts. 1989 playoff vs buffalo, 1994 wildcard win vs Patriots. Other suggestions, 1986 win at Pittsburgh (the broke the jinx to my dismay). 1999 win at Pittsburgh. 1986 win at Cincy to win AFC Central. 1980 win vs cincy to clinch division. 1989 win vs Denver and Houston. 1976 win vs Steelers (turkey jones game).",1275436800,,629,4.285714285714286

The Browns haven't even smelled a championship since 1964 when they beat the Colts for the NFL title--before the Super Bowl was invented.  In the early days of the franchise, the Browns were dominant, year after year.  I'd much prefer to see games from that period.

If the truly greatest games were imcluded, we'd see Jim Brown, Otto Graham, Milt Plum, Gary Collins, Marion Motley, Bobby Mitchell, Lou Groza, Mac Speedie, Horace Gillam et al., not the relatively meaningless games in seasons that were scarcely memorable.

Yes, and of course anytime the Browns destroyed the Steelers would be great, but please they don't even have the score correct, it was 51-0.  If they wanted three greatest games how about these, the upstart Browns from the ""Cream-puff League"" kick 1949 NFL Champs Eagles butt 35-10 in the opening game of the 1950 season?  Then there is the ""blizzard bowl"" with the Giants in 1950 after both teams tied for first place and after losing their only two games of the season to the New York Team take a 8-3 victory over them?  And number three, the 1950 NFL World Championship game when the ex-Cleveland (now Los Angeles and highest scoring team in NFL History)Rams and the Browns fight tooth and nail at the ""Old Gray Lady"" on the lake and the Browns of Otto Graham (four td's 22 of 33)win the game when Lou ""the Toe"" Groza boots a 16 yard Field Goal with 28 seconds left then seal the victory with an interception of a Norm Van Brocklin pass, 30-28.

The quality is ok, but not great (the Pittsburgh game is probably the worst) but in truth I wouldn't describe these as the Browns' 'greatest games'. Greatest games doesn't necessarily mean you won them and my own personal choices would be the 2 heatbreaking losses to Denver in the AFC Championship games and the double overtime playoff game against the Jets. Nevertheless, it was great to see some of the old players appearing on my screen again, particularly people such as Bernie Kosar, Frank Minnifield, Webster Slaughter, Eric Metcalf and many others.

It's a shame though that the NFL haven't producd a history of the Browns as they've done with many other NFL teams - I guess that might be because we are still searching for that elusive superbowl win.",1199145600,3,1011,4.64245810055866

Winner gets to host the same other team in the following week's wild card game. And the game even has an incident where an end zone cameraman gets knocked over a snowbank, stopping the game while medics tend to him. It was eerily similar to another (fictional) Browns game in which Jack Lemon is a sideline cameraman similarly knocked over a tarpaulin roller by a Browns running back in the film ""The Fortune Cookie"". I am a Bears fan but I loved watching this game because it reminded me of what watching the NFL was like in my youth (1960s). I even turned down the color on my TV to watch in black and white for a while. Luckily I saved the game on Beta and later transferred to a DVD. Much better than a boring blowout.",1516838400,,856,4.290123456790123
