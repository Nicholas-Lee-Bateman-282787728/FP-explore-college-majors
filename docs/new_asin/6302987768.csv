If you liked ""Girl 6"" or ""Showgirls"", then this may be something you'll want to see.  But know in advance that it is full of bad acting, fake fights, stock characters, and predictable plot turns.  The main reason to see this is to see Sonny Landham, an Adonis-like Native American actor and author.  Seeing him trying to lift up women and protect them from a dangerous environment was touching and titillating.  Unfortunately, this character has the same plight as most of the characters he's played throughout his career.",1133654400,3,612,4.62962962962963
