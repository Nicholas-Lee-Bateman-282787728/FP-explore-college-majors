8706954,3,B00UIK6O2K,"Hi, here fantasy combines with real life. The Son of Hercules ( RogerBrowne ) comes to Earth to win a battle and saves a princess from death, they both will fall in love since the very beginning, but the bad guy ( Massimo Serato ), that is trying to get the whole power, will not put things easy for our hero and his loved one. The princess is sent to the Temple as a priestess and will be accused of murder and condemned to be thrown to a  voracious moster plant, but the S.O.Hercules will fight with the bad one, who at the end will be the next meal for the monster, and at the nice last scene we will see the couple on a cart with horses going to Jupiter's heaven  such as Elias did at the Old Testament. An entertaining movie with a clever bad guy that plays a perfect Cain's role.",1436918400,,785,4.090909090909091
