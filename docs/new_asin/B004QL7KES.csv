8438269,5,B004QL7KES,"THIS IS NOT YOUR MOTHERS BOLLYWOOD... THIS FILM DEALS WITH ADULT TOPICS OF DRUG TRAFFICKING AND THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR IT. This is suitable for teens 14 and up.

If you like realistic ,gritty, stylishly well made and well produced films ala the Untouchables, then this ones for you. Extra added bonus the sound track is incredible minus a tiny point off for not being subtitled during the songs (see youtube for that).

PLOT: Drug trafficking in and out of Goa is destroying the tourism and a special police task force is appointed. Heading this up is Abi Bachchan whose portrayal of Kamath is imbued with the tortured cop persona similar to Mel Gibson's Lethal Weapon character Riggs. Smiles and sarcasm with a death wish. Kamath hand picks his staff by gut instinct and proceeds to clean the town of all the known drug dealers. Think Karma killer of actual believable proportions . Send in the unexpected loose cannon and shake the trees till the rotten fruit falls off. Each character is manipulated, lied to and betrayed by pride , dreams and ambitions. They will have different faces but with similar outcomes.  A mid-level gopher/mule helps his gorgeous girlfriend ( Bipasha Basu) get hooked up to his mafia boss for a job. She will pay the ultimate price over and over. If your a Mafia boss of epic proportions ala Deniro with a baseball bat, had to go there, then your the top. So where do you go ? Down of course. How you will get to the bottom of all this is a perfect ride to hell, Rohan Sippy driving. His accelerations, pauses and driveby's are breath taking and fierce. He has the ability to take the audience through the narrow rear  mirror of the obsessive bent on his goal. The only way I can get what I need is what someone is waving in front of me. The cop trying for redemption, the star crossed lovers, the families all paying the price for their loved ones with shame and seperation. We are tied and bound to them with the perception of power and oblivion via the criminal life. Have the guts to watch.

There are a lot of new faces in this one, fantastic sound track, surprise ending and a redemption of sorts.",1337644800,,2143,4.512886597938144
8438270,5,B004QL7KES,"This movie is awesome. The way it is filmed (saturated colors, really creative camera work) is enough to write home about with out taking in the great dialogue and superb acting (especially by Abeshiek as basically the Indian punisher) Also (especially for a Bollywood movie) this movie has some cajones, kinda shocking to see stuff that the US would censor to hell and back getting shown in a more conservative country.

Anything else I can say would be giving too much away so take it from me that this movie is really good, and definitely worth the watch at least once.",1336780800,,572,4.663366336633663
8438271,4,B004QL7KES,"DMD is a return to direction after a hiatus for Rohan Sippy, who had earlier directed the watchable ` BluffMaster"". It is also a refreshing change from the usual cops and drugs drama in the manner the narration unfolds and the anti-climax before the climax. It can be said that this is film-noir set in Goa.
  ACP Vishnu Kamath  Abhishek Bachchan) has been given an assignement by his boss to go and clean up Goa from the drug peddlers. AB chooses this gig only on the condition that his rules apply and there will be no referees. In Goa, he encounters a variety of characters, who have all been affected by the drug trade, a DJ  Rana Dagubatti), Bipasha Basu and an innocent  Prateik). Behind all their fates and holding sway over the drug trade is Biscuita  Aditya Panscholi). Biscuita is just a front, all clues point out to Michael Barbossa. Who is he? What's his identity?
The film is a good watch and time  2 hours 21 minutes) go by fast. It has good direction, good music and has been shot very stylishly. Abhishek is a natural and seems like he was born to play the rogue cop roles, he is immensely likable and I wonder why has not enjoyed success like his contemporaries? Rana Dagubatti is wooden but has a screen presence, Bipasha and Prateik are plain OK. Panscholi is the villain but did not seem to be viscous and he has tried hard. I loved the songs and they have been presented well and blend well with the natural beauty of Goa, Deepika Padukone gets a chance to shake a leg to Dum Maaro Dum but it was just blah for me.
Overall, this movie is good for a watch....4 stars....10/27/2011",1319760000,3,1601,4.425170068027211
