But, really, could they really top this?  I don't think so.  Just enjoy  this one because IT'S THE BEST in all respects: script, supporting  characters (almost TOO RICH), action, music, suspense, etc.  This will  always be one of my favorite movies regardless of category.

320821,5,6301221486,"Always been a fan of DeNiro and Grodin. Saw this movie years ago and it's still a favorite!

DeNiro plays Jack Walsh, an ex-cop from Chicago now working full time as a bounty hunter. He's good at his trade, but down-on-his-luck as he still misses his ex-wife who left him for a crooked cop. When his bail bond employer played by Joe Pantoliano asks him to go get the Duke back in 5 days time, Jack says no. The Duke, played by Grodin, went on the run with millions of dollars he took from a Chicago mobster (You'll love what he does with most of the money too). DeNiro doesn't believe the Duke is worth his time, but when Pantoliano offers him 100k, Jack says all right.

Also in the fold is the mob, who want the Duke dead or alive, and Marvin, a fellow bounty hunter also competing with Jack. The movie is full of funny quips, great scenery as they travel from LA to NYC, and back to LA. Yaphet Kotto is a federal agent who wants the Duke too, and can't stand burnout cops like Jack Walsh, but Jack is good at his job, and when he captures the Duke and begins the journey back to LA, the laughter begins as Jack and the Duke form a bond that sets the motion for funny and exciting chase scenes.",1509494400,,1196,4.1731601731601735

320921,5,6301221486,"This is a totally hysterical movie starring Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin in the most outrageous cross country chase adventure imaginable. De Niro plays Jack Walsh, former cop turned bounty hunter. He is hired to go after a mob accountant named Jonathan Mardukas (Charles Grodin) known as ""The Duke"". Mardukas got arrested for embezzlement and jumped bail. Walsh has to find him and bring him back to Los Angeles before the FBI, the mob boss who's money he stole and a rival bounty hunter get to him first. Sounds easy? Well it's not, as many unexpected dog leg turns lie ahead. The FBI needs Mardukas as a witness against the mob, the mob wants his dead and Walsh is likely to kill the Duke himself if he doesn't shut up. I highly recommend this movie if you like great comedy.",1488758400,2,782,4.553191489361702

Veteran actor Yaphet Kotto was great in his role as the frustrated FBI agent & I absolutely loved Dennis Farina as Jimmy Serrano, the mob boss who had 2 bumbling idiots working for him.

321082,5,6301221486,"BOTTOM LINE: MIDNIGHT RUN is a non-stop comedic cross country chase film, taking us from New York to the Chicago suburbs, thru the back country of Arizona, and finally the glitz & glamour of Las Vegas. If you like smartly written comedy, lots of action or are fan of either of the two stars then this Blu-ray is a must-own. Only real 'downside' is the harsh language, (for those with young kids and/or an aversion to cursing). Wonderful on-screen rivalry & chemistry between the two leads. Big bellylaughs + excellent action = a high replay value. 5 STARS

THE STORY (contains spoilers): De Niro plays Jack Walsh, a former cop now making a living as a bounty hunter, but looking to get out of the business and retire. He sees an opportunity to do just that with his latest assignment: the apprehension & return of Jonathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas (a perfectly cast Charles Grodin), a former mob accountant who jumped bail and is worth a cool $100,000 to Jack IF the man can be brought back before his bond defaults. For a man of Walsh's skills, finding ""The Duke"" is easy... returning him on time and in one piece is another matter altogether because brutish Vegas mobster Jimmy Serrano, (the Duke's former employer, who also has a complicated past with De Niro's Walsh), wants Mardukas torpedoed for what he did and for what he knows about Serrano's operations. On top of that, the Feds will do anything to capture Mardukas because his invaluable testimony would send Serrano & his goons up the river for good. This job will set Walsh up for the rest of his life... or end it.

THOUGHTS: Prior to this film, who knew Robert De Niro was so damn funny? MIDNIGHT RUN helped launch a second career for the well-established big screen tough guy, whose previous work always seemed to be lethal mafioso-types and/or creepy heavies. Ultra-dry Charles Grodin proves to be the the pitch perfect foil for the gruff, loutish De Niro, who also receives occasional visits from FBI Agent Alonso Mosely (an eternally frustrated Yaphett Kotto). Mob boss Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina), has perhaps the two stupidest flunkies this side of Moe Howard; both of whom spend the entire film's running time bungling one assassination attempt after another on Walsh & The Duke. Also figuring heavily in the plot is Joe Pantoliano, as weaselly, apoplectic bail-bondsman Eddie Mascone. Lastly, we can't forget Eddie's back-up bounty hunter, the not quite so bright Marvin Dorfler, wonderfully underplayed by John Ashton (Beverly Hills Cop). Terrific casting, excellent acting all around and a smart script to work from make this film a delight to watch. Honestly you could just watch De Niro & Grodin sitting around talking for the whole film and it would still be entertaining. They play off each other that well. Too bad they didn't do more films together. Additionally, when the two aren't at each other's throats they're caught up in some pretty terrific big screen action sequences that are energetic, logical within the context of the story and very well staged, with more than enough explosions, shootouts and car chases to satisfy even hardcore 80's action junkies.

THE BLU-RAY: For this new hi-def release from Shout! Factory the film received a 2k scan from the film's interpositive element. Resultant audio & video are both pretty strong BUT there is noticeable crush (video noise), and some pixelation in low light scenes. Not enough to detract from owning this, but you should be aware. Audio is clear, clean and mostly level. The Blu-ray comes loaded with some decent extras, including new individual on-camera interviews with most of the main cast, a vintage ""Making of"" featurette and a copy of the film's theatrical trailer. All-in-all a very respectable release that should please MIDNIGHT RUN fans, of which I am one.",1475798400,7,3806,4.906832298136646

321110,5,6301221486,"This 1988 film is without obvious parallel being an unusual combination of an action movie, a comedy movie and a buddy movie where the buddies are essentially on the opposite sides. The script is slick and tight and this is matched by the cast with snappy lines frequently delivered with deadpan manner which heightens their comic effect. Much depends on the casting of course, and in this the choices are spot-on. Interestingly. even when the events spiral out into almost surrealistic fantasy the film is easily able to carry the viewers with it.

This is a very engaging film which easily copes with repeated viewing and that is reflected in its long-term popularity and the option of a Blu-ray choice for purchasers. However, this review is not intended to discuss the merits and demerits of the actual film as by now it will have both its supporters and detractors. Entering into those conflicts is not the purpose of the review which is aimed squarely at the many supporters of this film.

Essentially, for all of those who are keen supporters of this film and who have bought the previous DVD version of this disc, the only issue of vital importance will be whether the Blu-ray offers an improvement technically sufficient to justify the additional expense.

For this reviewer the answer is a clear affirmative. The upgrade offers a clear advance on both image and audio quality with the imaging being a marked improvement. The colours are firmer and there is an increase to the perceived depth of the imaging. The whole film simply becomes more 'real.' The film, which is so concerned with close characterisation, benefits considerably from this enhancement of reality. The action elements are equally vivid and enhanced accordingly.

The degree of improvement experienced from this BD will also inevitably depend on the replay equipment used. The following technical information is intended to be a guide to aid in assessment.

The screen used for this review is only of moderate dimensions being a 40 inch television screen. However, the television is a high performing 4K unit which delivers a compensating positive effect. The moderate screen size lacks the impact of larger screens but is less critical of film faults.

However, the contributing player is, unusually, able to separate the audio and visual HDMI signals before they leave separately to the television and pre-amp. That feature enhances both the visual and audio elements of the output. The audio delivers an unusually wide-ranging and revealing performance. Its precision is equally revealing of dialogue and action sequences.

Readers with alternative equipment will have to interpret this review bearing in mind their own equipment and its comparative advantages and disadvantages.

The disc offers purchasers with suitable replay equipment a substantial improvement over the previous DVD.

In summary this BD is a transfer from good quality 1988 film stock and has responded well to the upgrade and well worth considering. This Blu-ray option should be very tempting and rewarding for all those supporters of this very popular film.",1474675200,,3113,5.148514851485149

Bounty hunter Jack Walsh has got a new assignment, one that could set him up for retirement. He's just got to get bail-jumping accountant Jonathan The Duke Mardukas back to L.A. by midnight on Friday. But he's not the only one on his trail. The Duke's just embezzled $15 million from the mob who want him dead, trying to get him first are the FBI who wants him to testify, five minutes in his company and Jack just wants him to shut up. It's going to be a long journey from New York to L.A.!

With a razor-sharp script and performances to match, Martin Brest's cult road movie sees Robert De Niro give one of his greatest comic performances, equally matched by his co-star Charles Grodin.

FILM FACT: To research for his role, Robert De Niro worked with real-life bounty hunters and police officers. As Jack Walsh un-cuffs Jonathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas on the train, the latter says, ""Thanks, 'cause they're starting to cut into my wrists.'"" In fact, Charles Grodin has permanent scars resulting from the handcuffs he had to wear for most of the film. The scene where Jonathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas falls off a cliff, this was shot on location in the Salt River Canyon in White Mountain, Arizona and the conclusion, taking place in rapids, was shot in New Zealand because the water was too cold in Arizona. Martin Brest was impressed by Charles Grodin's audition with Robert De Niro, however, feeling that there was a real chemistry between the two actors.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In 1988 Universal released MIDNIGHT RUN, as a high-profile action comedy. It contained several elements that were unusual for a film of its type and genre and now is finally available on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK of this seminal action film. For starters, Robert De Niro was the lead. The idea of this brooding method actor playing it light was virtually unthinkable at the time, especially with ANALYZE THIS a decade. It found great success at the box office, though perhaps its inevitable the result ended up as more of a cult offering, never quite getting the critical attention it deserved. As it rolls into town on Blu-ray, theres never been a better time to reappraise the production as one of the most underrated buddy films of all time.

Jack Walsh [Robert De Niro], a cop-turned-bounty hunter, who is given an easy assignment, the midnight run of the title in escorting former mob accountant Jonathan The Duke Mardukas [Charles Grodin] across country after he skipped a sizeable bail. Jonathan The Duke Mardukas ran off with millions belonging to the fearsome Jimmy Serrano [Dennis Farina], giving the money to charity and becoming a national hero of sorts in the process. A smooth operation goes pear-shaped when Jonathan The Duke Mardukas [Charles Grodin] tells Jack Walsh [Robert De Niro], he cant fly, and from there on in everything that can go wrong does go wrong, leading to an epic road trip packed with pitfalls such as raging rivers, a rival bondsman and bullet-spewing helicopters.  Everyone it seems wants Jonathan The Duke Mardukas captured or whacked before Jack Walsh can turn him in and collect his own reward.

The main thing to say about this action packed film is that despite of its high octane antics it has an easy-going likeability other films would kill for. This is down to the offbeat chemistry between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin, a masterstroke of casting from director Martin Brest and his team. Jack Walshs tough guy exterior gets the slow burn treatment from a laconic but mischievous Jonathan The Duke Mardukas, and gradually he is worn down until the pair become friends. The other factor is George Gallos excellent script, which bursts at the seams with memorable lines, like Is this Moron No. 1? Put Moron No. 2 on the phone? is a particular favourite. Every character talks like a screwball comedian, but under Martin Brest there is grit and an intimacy that makes it all seem natural.

Because you have Robert De Niro and Dennis Farina in the frame, it also means the serious scenes carry a mighty punch. The scene where Jack Walsh is briefly reunited with his wife and daughter, who he lost contact with following a bribery scandal at his former job and is beautifully-played and Serrano and Jonathan The Duke Mardukass fleeting scene together is a sliver of ice among the pratfalls. The biggest surprise is perhaps Yaphet Kotto as Alonzo Mosely, an FBI agent who falls foul of Jack Walsh early on, enduring humiliation after humiliation. This is a great film about hard men losing their dignity, from Serranos exasperation over his lackeys incompetence to the stripping of Jack Walshs rough-house shell by Jonathan The Duke Mardukas.

Danny Elfmans rock-blues soundtrack is an absolute triumph and a shock if all youve never heard from him with his thundering strings like he did for Tim Burton films. Theres a bit of distortion on the opening music for this 1080p transfer, but despite this minor quibble, it still is an absolute triumph. What is also brilliant about this Blu-ray release is the spectacular vista of visions of the dusty life on the road, which took place in a location shoot in New Zealand, and the neon signs of Las Vegas look even crisper and spectacular.

Maybe the biggest compliment you can pay is that when its time for the journey to end, you feel genuinely sad that these guys have to part. The door was open for a sequel, and TV series follow-up were made without Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin being involved. But its probably it was best that this remained a one-off. Think 1980s films about mismatched buddies are old hat? Stick this in your Blu-ray player and prepare to be totally amazed, especially of the comic interplay between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin in MIDNIGHT RUN is a delight as well as pure gold. Two more stand-out performances come from Yaphet Kotto, as FBI Special Agent Alonzo Mosely, and John Ashton, as rival bounty hunter Marvin Dorfler and when the FBI chief steals Marvin's cigarettes again, he quips: ""Why don't you quit? It'd be cheaper for both of us."" MIDNIGHT RUN builds to a dramatic and satisfying conclusion, with a wonderful closing line. A timeless treat!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Second Sight has released MIDNIGHT RUN a really good stable 1080p encoded image transfer and a serious step up all round. The image itself is spotless, the picture rock solid in frame, the sharpness and picture detail crisp and the colour largely naturalistic. The contrast is punchy throughout and when the lighting is favourable this results in a really pleasing image, but in darker scenes this can result in some of the detail being sucked in to get those solid black levels, though no more so than on Universal Pictures previous inferior DVD. On the whole, this is a very fine job all round. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Second Sight has released MIDNIGHT RUN with two alternative audio soundtracks, which consists of 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio and 5.1 DTS HD-Master Audio, and the 2.0 LPCM track is the closest to how the film was originally shown in the cinema. Surprisingly, I much preferred the 2.0 LPCM Stereo track, which has a brightness and clarity that feels a tad subdued on the 5.1 track, where a little too much to the lower frequency sound ended up in the subwoofer. But if you do prefer to view it with the 5.1 track, a word of warning, as the lip syncing is totally out sync and is very unncomfortable to watch, but most importantly the dialogue and music come across particularly well; though neither have quite the dynamic range of more modern studio features.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: We Got the Duke  Interview with Charles Grodin [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [12:24] Here we find Charles Grodin who is much older and really shocked me, but is much slimmer wearing a baseball cap. The still instantly recognisable Charles Grodin, and there's something about that voice and remembers how he landed a role that plenty of actors wanted and Paramount Pictures apparently wanted Cher to play his part in the film. Yes, you read that right, Cher the singer turned actress who was flying high at the time off the success of Moonstruck, can you imagine, and so when Martin Brest would not do what they say, Universal Pictures took up the rights to the film because Martin Brest and George Gallo wanted Charles Grodin.  Charles talks about his unconventional first marriage and his current long-lasting one and reveals that his favourite exchange in the boxcar scene and the aforementioned comment that was a sexual put down comment that is too extreme to reprint here and one was the result of him being asked by director Martin Brest to improvise an exchange that would allow the two characters to re-bond. I particularly liked Charles Grodin's comment about when he was in a Broadway play entitled Sometime Next Year and Sir Lawrence Olivier came to his dressing room and because the way you see him talk in this interview, he spoke the same way to this English actor, and got told off the way he spoke to Sir Lawrence Olivier, but he says he could not understand the negative comment. We also hear that Charles Grodin also does a lot of directing and also loves doing One Man Shows. Charles talks specifically about that specific scene in the film where Robert De Nero and himself were going down the dangerous rapids and says it was in Arizona and the water was freezing cold and if they had stayed in too long, they would have ended up seriously ill, so eventually they finished the rapid scene in New Zealand and the water was much warmer. As we get near the end of the interview, Charles mentions that he has just watched MIDNIGHT RUN again, and feels it was a brilliant film to be in and was very proud of his work on the film and was also proud of all the people he worked with. Director: David Gregory. Producer: Carl Daft. Executive Producer: Chris Holden. This was a Severin Films, Inc. Production.

Special Feature: Moscone Bail Bonds  Interview with Joe Pantoliano [14:24] Adorned in a jacket, a beret and a silver neck chains, the ever so slightly bohemian and a much older looking Joe Pantoliano and recalls how he got into acting, how he landed the role of Eddie Moscone of the Bail Bond establishment and informs us that director Martin Brest was initially not convinced he would be right for the part, because being too young and too slim for the role as originally envisaged, and reading and working with Robert De Niro. Joe Pantoliano outlines the importance of nailing the audition and too many came in and just gushed at Robert De Niro, and has the highest of praise for Charles Grodin, who he also informs us that he was ""a genius comedian,"" whose performance he claims is the glue of the film. We find out that Joe Pantoliano in his early years grew up poor and had dyslexic with attention deficit and was encourage to go into acting. Joe praises George Gallo for producing a brilliant script that was a rollercoaster type film with lots of twists and turns and was really proud of being in the film. Interviewer: Josh Johnson. Director: David Gregory. Producer: Carl Daft. Executive Producer: Chris Holden. This was a Severin Films, Inc. Production.

Special Feature: Hey Marvin!  Interview with John Ahston [17:27] Sporting a flat cap and a sizeable cigar, the hugely entertaining and good natured John Ahston who provides some brilliant anecdotes about the making of MIDNIGHT RUN and the interview is also surprisingly moving, and even poignant as John Ashton sincerely explains why he became an actor, and he never looked back. John also talks about remembering landing the role of Taggart in film franchise Beverley Hills Cop, and being prompted to adlib by director Martin Brest, but after the third film felt he had got into a rut and through circumstances found out about the role in MIDNIGHT RUN and auditioning with Robert De Niro and his story confirms Joe Pantoliano's claim that your acting career can depend on what you do in that few minutes you spend in the audition room. John Ahston claims that had he not got into acting that he'd probably be dead by now and says, ""I was a bit of a juvenile delinquent"" and reveals that Dorfler was a real scumbag in the script and was originally killed off, but a rewrite was forced when it was realised that he was becoming so likeable. The funniest bit has John Ashton recalls that he and Robert De Niro's use of what he calls a very over the top expletive swear words, to judge whether they were overdoing the excessive swearing, and he gets surprisingly emotional when he talks about why he became an actor. John also gives great praise about screenwriter George Gallo and felt it was the best script he had ever read and also gives great praise about the director Martin Brest. Like just about everyone else interviewed here, he has nothing but fond memories of the shoot itself and regards it as ""the best film I ever did, best film experience I ever had, bar none,"" even thought it was a 6 month shoot and a 14 hour a day shoot. I must say this is one of the best interviews I have ever seen and John Ashton is a very funny man and was filmed at the Verrado Golf Club, Buckeye, Arizona. Director: David Gregory. Producer: Carl Daft. Executive Producer: Chris Holden. This was a Severin Films, Inc. Production.

Special Feature: Midnight Writer  Interview with Screenwriter George Gallo [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [24:44] Here we have a fascinating interview with the screenwriter George Gallo, and we find out he was either 21 or 22 when he wrote his first script, and felt it was the only way of getting into movies. We find out that the thoroughly engaging George Gallo covers in some detail how MIDNIGHT RUN came to be with regards to Bounty Hunters, and confirms that Paramount Pictures were pushing Martin Brest hard to cast Cher as Mardukas, whereas ""Paramount Pictures wanted the star for the movie,"" and suggests that Martin Brest's refusal to give in to this was what led them to take the project to Universal Pictures instead. George discusses his working relationship with Martin Brest, his dizziness at being a 31-year-old newcomer and hanging out with Robert De Niro, and reveals that a key sequence in the film stems from his own fear of flying, one that came close to losing him the gig when he refused to travel by plane with Martin Brest from Chicago to New York and the whole project was very draining, but also very enjoyable at the same time, as he put his heart and soul into the project. All in all this was another brilliant interview, especially the fact that George Gallo is a very likeable person and was very interesting to listen to. Director: David Gregory. Producer: Carl Daft. Executive Producer: Chris Holden. This was a Severin Films, Inc. Production.

Special Feature: I'm Mosely!  Audio Interview with Yaphet Kotto [2015] [1080p] [1.78:1] [7:36] The wonderful Yaphet Kotto [Alien and Live and Let Die] is interviewed by phone and remembers how refreshing it was to get a comedy script after a slew of screenplays for would-be Alien clones had landed on his desk. He fondly recalls working with Martin Brest and Robert De Niro, and describes Mosely as the black Inspector Clouseau and ""was completely and absolutely out of his fricking mind."" This was a Severin Films, Inc. Production.

Special Feature: Original Making Midnight Run Promo [1988] [480i] [1.33:1] [7:26] This Universal Pictures promo is a very typical of its 1980s period, but nonetheless it is a valuable inclusion promotional feature made at the time the film came out, especially with its brief interview bites from Robert De Niro, Charles Grodin, John Ashton, Yaphet Kotto, Yaphet Ashton, Dennis Farina and also some of the other cast, and we also get to see director Martin Brest and a young George Gallo [screenwriter], plus behind-the-scenes footage, and a couple of shots that didn't make it into the final film.

Finally, it is easy to tell that British distributors Second Sight Films wanted to have a really nice sparkling Blu-ray release of director Martin Brest's MIDNIGHT RUN, and is helped that they included some really excellent exclusive new supplemental features for this Blu-ray release. MIDNIGHT RUN, is still one of the most sublimely written, performed, directed and scored comedy-dramas of the 1980s and one of my all-time favourite mismatched pair to appear in this particular road movie. It features Robert De Niro's first and finest comic performance, Charles Grodin at his on-screen finest, a pair of pitch-perfect turns from Yaphet Kotto and Dennis Farina, and oh yes, it is just totally funny and utterly terrific film. Second Sight Blu-ray is a huge leap over the previous inferior DVD release in every respect, and thus I have to concur that this is a highly welcome release. With any luck this excellent package will bring this unsung gem to a new audience, and if you were one of the people who wrote it off back in the day then this is the perfect chance to give it another go as it is easily one of the most enjoyable comedy thrillers to have come out of the 1980s, having aged a lot more gracefully than most of its contemporaries. MIDNIGHT RUN is again is a very funny and exciting and the actors often improvise their dialogue, but the film is always under control, never over-acted, never ingratiatingly sentimental, and is never played for easy laughs. Highly Recommended!

The great original soundtrack. The background score in the entire movie gives you the feel of mischief and naughtiness and gels amazingly with the awesome screenplay.

Robert De Niro is simply amazing as the bounty hunter and Charles Grodin does it superbly as the irritating accountant or bounty. I also loved the character of Alonzo Mosely.

The movie's direction, editing and acting by every single character makes it so real that you actually start believing all of the chase and deceit is possible! It's a classic and deserves to be in everyone's all time favorites list.",1451347200,2,880,4.9391891891891895

321487,4,6301221486,"One of the key ingredients for a successful movie is chemistry that evolves between actors playing particular characters. In the case of Midnight Run, Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are unlikely bedfellows as a bail bounty-hunter and his bail-jumper accountant who used to keep the books on a mobster who runs drug rings in Chicago and Las Vegas (where else?). Jack Walsh (De Niro) has been hired by a sleazy bail bond firm in Los Angeles to bring back Jonathan ""the Duke"" Mardukas (Grodin) in 72 hours or everyone turns into pumpkins. His bounty is worth $100,000, partially because the firm put up nearly one half a million dollars for the bail. If Grodin isn't brought back in time, the courts will keep the bail money and the firm will be out of business.

However, it turns out there are other parties involved who also want Mardukas. The mild-mannered accountant had been keeping the books on the mob for several years but didn't realize he was doing it for Jimmy Serrano, one of the most notorious drug king-pins in Chicago. Before the events of the movie, Mardukas, upon realizing his involvement, embezzled millions of the mob's drug money but made the fatal mistake of sending postcards to Serrano bragging about how he was using the money to fund charitable causes. He was arrested for being party to the mob but later skipped out on bail.

The story begins with De Niro being hired to track down Mardukas to bring him back to Los Angeles, although the mob might try to assassinate him before any kind of legal proceedings. Grodin still has in his possession all the ""goods"" on the mob, their racketeering, etc. So the mob decides they want Grodin before he is returned to custody. Then add to the mix the FBI who also gets into the act decides they need Grodin to help build their case against Serrano. If that isn't enough, the bail bond firm, distrusting De Niro, hires yet another sleazy bounty hunter, Marvin, who also wants to get Grodin for the payback money.

Walsh finds Mardukas at a mundane New York apartment with his wife. The original plan is to take him to LA via a plane, but Mardukas claims that he suffers from a fear of flying and forces them to take a cross-country trip. ""Midnight Run"" is essentially a cross between several genres: a cross-country chase movie, a comedy, a buddy movie, an action movie. Not unlike the road movies of the 1940's, the two characters end up in all kinds of strange locales across the United States, from Chicago suburbs to the Arizona desert. They go by passenger trains, stolen cars, even a cargo train.

Aside from the essential plot, which is a bit fantastical in retrospect but plausible enough to suspend your disbelief during the course of the movie, the real gem is the relationship between De Niro and Grodin. I don't think these actors had ever played in a film before this pairing and yet they seem strangely natural together. De Niro as Walsh is the cigarette-smoking hard-talking urbanite who looks like his clothes were laundered last in the 1970's. By contrast, Grodin is the soft-spoken suburbanite accountant who thinks in terms of practical decisions, the complete opposite from De Niro. During the entire film, Grodin needles De Niro about his habits and eventually his relationships, including his ex-wife and daughter. At first the two dislike one another, particularly De Niro towards Grodin, but by the end something has changed.

A really fun movie, a bit mad-cap in places, but the real treasure is the chemistry between De Niro and Grodin. Throughout the movie, there are several ongoing jokes, but the one that stands out is ""maybe in the next life"", meaning that De Niro and Grodin could have been friends under different circumstances. Although I wouldn't go as far as to say this is a terribly deep movie, it's almost perfect escapist fair.",1433808000,,3835,4.760902255639098

MIDNIGHT RUN: Like ""48 HRS."" or ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" the contentious relationship between the two central characters is central to the story. And these two guys are mirror images of one another. Jack is rabidly sarcastic; Jon, the voice of serene reason. Jack is overtly obnoxious; Jon, covertly obnoxious, full of disdain for Jack's lack of responsibility in all areas of his life. Yet this ""Odd Couple"" opposition is only the surface of the mirror: Beneath their opposing styles, they discover a shared integrity and history. On their crosscountry jaunt they bicker, question, confess, commiserate, and eventually develop a begrudging respect for one another--all the while engaged in a cat-and-mouse game of capture and attempted escape.

Grodin holds his own against DeNiro (no easy feat) and the two have a real chemistry. It's a canny, deftly directed action flick with a sharp script, expert chase scenes, smart plot twists and delightful dialog--as well as Farina as a Mafia don with the most creative threats in cinema history.",1421712000,,1295,4.9631336405529956

1. A cop (Robert DeNiro) turns bounty hunter because of corruption in the Chicago Department in which he had been working (not a part of the movie).
2. He picks up a white collar criminal who stole from the gangster that chased him out of Chicago.
3. Said white collar criminal tries to escape several times.
4. There is also a second bounty hunter that was put onto DeNiro's trail by the bond broker, and that leads to some amusing misadventures.

Verdict: This movie is great. It's worth the price if you want to see it on demand and worth the time that it takes to see it. (It happens that I bought this movie for a coworker whose characteristics exactly resembled those of a character in the movie.)",1401494400,,734,4.511278195488722

322020,5,6301221486,"This is a surprisingly little known, brilliant, intelligent comedy about numerous criminals, two bounty hunters, one accountant and one FBI agent. It is also about cigarettes, sunglasses, aviaphobia, counterfeited money and real money. To say long things short, this is a MASTERPIECE of humour!

Bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) is enlisted by a bail bondsman to bring accountant Jonathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas (Charles Grodin) back to Los Angeles. Mardukas supposedly stole $15 million from Chicago mob boss Jimmy Serrano (Denis Farina) before skipping the $450,000 bail that was posted for him. If Jack can bring Mardukas in during the next five days, he will get $100 000. But Mardukas is also being tracked by another bounty hunter, a brutish and mean but slightly dim guy named Marvin (John Ashton). Mob boss Jimmy Serrano and FBI agent Alonso Mosley (grandiose Yaphet Kotto) want the renegade accountant too...

What follows is a brilliant comedy which takes us on 126 minutes long the incredibly entertaining odyssey through of most of continental Unites States by almost every way of travelling that is humanely possible. During all this time the seemingly defenseless and harmless Mardukas will submit the seemingly tough like nails bounty hunter Jack Walsh to a treatment which can only be described as psychological waterboarding - there will be moments when the poor bounty hunter will WISH to be dead!

Locked in a mutually abusive relationship, Walsh and Mardukas will also have to run from the hired killers, the FBI agents and last but not least from Marvin, who, albeit not very bright, will still manage to make their life very interesting in numerous occasions...

I saw this film at least six times and every time I loved it even more, as I still discover some new jokes and goofs at every viewing. The number of gags, both verbal and situational, is purely unbelievable and Robert De Niro and professional comedian Charles Grodin are simply UNBELIEVABLY GREAT! This film has also considerable charm, is quite heart-warming, never really sounds vulgar even if there is some strong language and finally, the ending is particularly good.

I must admit that towards the end I grew very fond of ALMOST ALL the characters (including some of the mobsters!) and I was really sorry when this film ended - but in this time the obsession with sequels was not as strong as today and, Praised Be The Lord, nobody even tried to make a ""Midnight Run 2"".

Bottom line, this is an EXCELLENT film, one of my absolutely favourite modern comedies. To buy, watch, keep and re-watch. Enjoy!",1391731200,,2596,4.983833718244804

I love this movie because it's a total romp - the script is smart, funny and touching with not too much violence, which is amazing considering it concerns the mafia.

Robert De Niro plays the hard as nails bounty hunter perfectly off of Grodin's resigned accountant to the mob, lamb to the slaughter lovable and long suffering bad guy you have to love. Yaphet Kotto is so much fun as well.

My one complaint - the incessant and loud use of the word of which R ratings are made. These actors are so far above relying on a single word to convey anything. If they'd dialed it back, this could have been fun for the whole family. The dialogue was otherwise brilliant. Why ruin such a good thing?",1382918400,,673,4.471544715447155

Great to see two fine actors like Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin whilst at their peak. They appear to be having much fun. The plot offers enough complexity to be interesting , while the expletive laced dialogue throughout the movie; perhaps harsh for some, provides realism. Solid performances from the supporting cast is another movie plus. Mix all this in with just enough humor and it all adds up to a very good movie experience. I have to add that I was awestruck noting the shear numbers of cigarettes consumed in the movie. The De Niro character smoked relentlessly as did several others. At least the Grodin character protested (to no avail).  Highly recommended.",1373500800,,778,4.762962962962963

Charles Grodin is the accountant who embezzled $15 million and gave it to charity; he now has a vengeful mob boss to avoid while also trying to escape De Niro's custody. Further complications are an FBI agent (Yaphet Kotto) De Niro made look foolish, and a second bounty hunter hired to snag Grodin away from De Niro.

Grodin is certain he'll be ""hit"" once back in Los Angeles but De Niro's only concern is the payoff that will allow him to open a cafe and thus escape a job he hates. As the two head west by train, bus and car, they have several run-ins with the feds, the mob and the other bountyman, sometimes simultaneously. Through these ordeals, a hostile friendship develops between the men.

Robert De Niro's next role was the Vietnam Vet title character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JACKNIFE/dp/B000K7UBO8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JACKNIFE</a>&nbsp;(1989).

322265,3,6301221486,"I had ""Midnight Run"" on VHS tape some years ago and either lost it when I moved across country or threw it out, so I was glad to get a new copy.  I have to say though, two of the other movies on these two disks are pretty much a waste of time.

I don't see the problem as being the fault of Chris McDonald. He could only work with what he was given.  On both ""Another Midnight Run,"" and ""Midnight Run Around,"" the story/script was pitiful.  The Jack Walsh that was portrayed by Robert DeNiro in the initial Midnight Run movie would never have behaved like the ignorant person of the later films who repeatedly allowed his ""prisoners"" to escape on the most flimsy pretenses.  Once I got around to ""Midnight Run For Your Life,"" I was thoroughly annoyed.  However that movie, while not up to the standard of the first film, was at least not as bad as the 2nd and 3rd stories.  I almost felt sorry for McDonald because the Jack Walsh he was given to portray was truly a pitiful person, and he probably did the best he could with disastrous scripts.  While I will probably watch the DeNiro film now and then, I doubt I'll ever be tempted to watch the other three again.",1358726400,4,1164,4.28310502283105

His luck changed with this buddy road movie which perfectly pairs him with the dead pan droll Charles Grodin--they're a match made in heaven!!  I hopefully doubt that there'll be a remake of this '80s comedy because this film is a riot thanks to this duo and also director Martin Brest who has lost his touch recently with ""Gigli"" and ""Meet Joe Black"" has perhaps made his best movie to stand alongside ""Scent Of A Woman"" with Pacino.

It is hard to find anything positive to say about any of the 3 TV films.  Another Midnight Run (1st TV film) was watchable, but flat and slow moving.  The con artists were initially entertaining then they just became very annoying.  Midnight Run Around (2nd TV film) was just plain terrible in every regard.  Midnight Run for your life (Last TV film) was better than the 2nd film, but that is faint praise.  I did like the hired killer.  The original DiNiro version will get a lot of viewing, the other films will just gather dust.",1333670400,,655,4.355371900826446
322324,5,6301221486,"""Midnight Run"" is an action comedy genre film with a narrative that focuses on bounty hunter Jack Walsh's (Robert De Niro) cross country escapade with convicted creative accountant Jonathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas (Charles Grodin). It is a journey of self-discovery for hardnosed Walsh, as The Duke reintroduces him to compassion, and a chance meeting with a daughter he hasn't seen in years. The steel heart of Walsh is continually eroded by the gentle and at times sneaky Duke, and their death defying adventure certainly brings out the best in both of them.

322325,5,6301221486,"Of course, the original Midnight Run is a classic.  It is in my opinion, one of the best ""buddy"" movies of all time.  Both Deniro and Grodin are in excellent form, and they were well matched in casting.

Many have criticized the Midnight Run tv movies.  The criticisms are not well founded in my opinion.  I found all three to be good solid comedies.

In the first movie, the acting is a bit over the top, as the cast tries to find their place in the roles, but the stories in all three films are solid and the acting gets better and better as the films roll along.

What makes the tv movies work is not necessarily the Deniro character (though Christopher Macdonald does his best and actually gets better as the movies progress, so that by the third film, he is comfortable in a role established by one of the finest actors of our generation).

No, it is the bad guys who make the movie work.  In the first one, the con artist couple were hilarious.  In the second, the country boy bad guy was wonderful and the supporting cast were just as good.  and finally, in the third movie, the girl who is trying to ""off"" herself was very compelling.

Grodin and Deniro work perfectly off one another, that's what actually makes it so good.  I would love to see those two reunite in something if Grodin is still doing movies.

Watching the film too is a great time piece of our culture.  We still use all the words in the movie (or at least I do sometimes), but it was interesting to be reminded of all the smoking that we used to have... planes, trains, airports, diners, bars...

As an ex-cop bounty hunter with good intentions, De Niro takes a potentially flavorless role and shapes it into something deeper, adding personality and character where it's clear none was hinted in the script. Director Martin Brest deserves credit for allowing his cast the chance to ad-lib, as the film enjoys a much more honest, believable central relationship as a result. While the plot bears more than a passing resemblance to ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" it's more straight-laced than that and never completely steps across the line into full-on comedy, though it does test those boundaries once or twice. An overachieving, tenuous buddy film in the same vein as ""48 HRS"", it maintains a quick pace on a winding path without throwing its passengers.",1309305600,4,944,5.019108280254777
322331,5,6301221486,"Recently in the past, I began an investigation. To track down the Midnight Run movies that starred Christopher McDonald as Jack Walsh.

What I wasn't prepared for was the five-year-long battle I had with the internet.  Time had completely forgot about these movies that apparently were ""not so good."" The three ""Universal Action Pack"" movies were great.  I was able to track them down in a small video rental store somewhere in Great Britain. They were not released on VHS here in the States.  Finally, Universal has decided to release them with the De Niro classic on DVD.

""Another Midnight Run"" is a decent flick but McDonald's Jack Walsh is basically a complete moron.  Not the best in the bunch but still fun to watch at 3 A.M. when there's nothing on TV and you can't sleep. Cathy Moriarty and Jeffrey Tambor are funny and welcome in the film as Walsh's con-artist bail-jumpers.

""Midnight Runaround"" was much better but, unfortunately, still had a bit of Walsh's elements of stupidity from AMR.  The sinister Oklahoma town who united to prevent Kyle Secor's arrest quickly turns silly and the film runs out of gas just in time to save it. In ode to the original film, Walsh befriends his young bail jumper but the magic from the De Niro/Grodin friendship is, unfortunately absent.  In the end, this was an entertaining sequel.

""Midnight Run for Your Life"" was, IMHO, the best of the three McDonald films. Written by Shaun Cassidy and co-starring the lovable Melora Walters, Walsh heads to Cabo San Lucas to track down an accused murder who's being chased by a hit man, the police, and a drug dealer and must bring her back to L.A. alive. The silliness from the first two films are still around but doesn't kill the film's somewhat serious atmosphere. Walter's character is both fun and serious when she tries to kill herself multiple times. MRFYL is well written and well acted for a TV movie. It was great fun.

If you are a die hard fan of the original film, DO NOT expect much from the sequels.  They were produced for TV during MCA's Action Pack program which had a lot of made-for-TV sequels and spin-offs that included four ""Bandit"" films...or sequels to ""Smokey and the Bandit.""  Action Pack's Midnight Run films were not as big as the De Niro film but entertaining action comedies.",1298160000,21,2297,4.7125

Real comedy works best when the characters don't have to act funny - they just play exactly who they are and the casting of DeNiro and Godin is right on the money.  Also making this fly are John Ashton as the rival bounty hunter and the classic Dennis Farina plays his wiseguy role with little work.

This was a sleeper road movie - action comedy hit that hasn't been bettered much.  I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to remake this.

322396,4,6301221486,"MIDNIGHT RUN is an action/comedy/road picture/buddy film with a twist: these ""buddies"" despise each other.

Robert DeNiro is an ex-cop bounty hunter who can earn 100K if he safely transports a former mob accountant from NYC to L.A. before a certain day and time. Charles Grodin is the accountant who embezzled $15 million and gave it to charity; he now has a vengeful mob boss to avoid while also trying to escape DeNiro's custody. Further complications are an FBI agent (Yaphet Kotto) DeNiro made look foolish, and a second bounty hunter hired to snag Grodin away from DeNiro.

Grodin is certain he'll be ""hit"" once back in Los Angeles but DeNiro's only concern is the payoff that will allow him to open a cafe and thus escape a job he hates. As the two head west by train, bus and car, they have several run-ins with the feds, the mob and the other bountyman, sometimes simultaneously. Through these ordeals, a hostile friendship develops between the men.

322397,5,6301221486,"Wow! How we LOVE this film to pieces, and I scratch my head at those who don't get it. I never saw this lovely gem back in the `80s, ""But I was just a kid..."" My dad took me to see ""Roger Rabbit,"" and that was my main interest. I actually do remember seeing a theatrical TV spot for ""Midnight"" at the time. ""These guys have 5 days to get from New York to Los Angeles..."" For years; I pondered what film that commercial was for. I'd skipped many syndicated viewings of ""Midnight"" over time (probably best I missed the edited `cut' anyway), until a couple years ago. My sister & mother had tuned-in on of the 100+ movie channels, and I sat in for the latter half. Both the ""In the next life"" & ""The desert run chase"" scenes were what clinched it for me. I also scratch my head as to `how?' this film escaped me for 20 years.

As of this date; I am a total devotee to ""Midnight."" I recently won a vintage `Advance' poster off E-Bay, which was put out right before the movie was released. I've nicknamed it ""The White Poster."" It's 27X40, and has this same pose (from an actual still) of De Niro & Grodin fleeing. The day-by-day taglines are listed above the picture. Sorry; this poster seems to be one-of-a-kind. Good news is that the Nostalgia Factory has ""Midnight"" press kits/stills available, for those of you hunting merchandise. I bought the soundtrack album from an Amazon seller as well. If you Google ""Erasing Clouds - Midnight Run,"" you'll find a nice little article about the film too.

I don't own the HD version, but my thanks to those of you who've written reviews. Hopefully; Universal will put out a Blu-ray copy in the future? Like most of you; I hold great hope for a future commentary track + those deleted scenes we all know exist. I'd love to hear Martin Brest's own story about his ""baby."" For those of you who see the ""Rain Man (Special Edition),"" check out the commentary tracks by both Barry Morrow & Ron Bass. They will give you some insight into Brest's involvement in both ""Rain Man"" and ""Midnight.""

""The tough bounty hunter & the sensitive criminal"" are definitely at the heart of this film. It's a true labor of love from the creators/crew & all the actors. They're what really make this film a lasting gem! The icing on the cake are Danny Elfman's score, and also Grodin's facial expressions. I can't help but think about ""Midnight,"" whenever I see a package of Chorizo at my supermarket.  That's still on my taste-test list.

The byplay between DeNiro (in his first comedic role) and Charles Grodin is just precious -- Grodin as the carping accountant-on-the-lamb who drives bounty hunter DeNiro crazy in their cross-country jaunt.  The dialog is snappy, the action first rate, and the supporting cast (Joe Pantoliano as the sleazy bail bondsman, Yaphet Kotto as the frustrated federal agent, and John Ashton as the competing bungling bounty hunter -- oh yes, and Dennis Farina as a truly nasty mob boss) could not be better.

After DeNiro's first 150 utterances of the F-word  (all in the first three minutes), its sheer reflexivity neutralizes the shock value. (Though the bleeped-out TV version I've seen once or twice is just as funny.)

BRILLIANT writing: not a false note in the dialogue, nothing that strains credulity or bogs down the story. Too many unforgettable lines to list. My favorite might be the exchange, toward the end, between DeNiro's Walsh and the FBI agent Mosely who's dogged him most of the movie.  DeNiro's bloodied-but-unbowed cockiness and the total unexpectedness of Mosely's (grudging and quickly revoked) hint of a smile is one of the better moments in film history.

Alonzo Mosely: ""What should be of paramount importance to you right now....is the fact that you're gonna spend 10 years in the penitentiary for impersonating a federal officer.

Jack Walsh: 10 years for impersonating a fed, uh?

322405,3,6301221486,"I was looking forward to replacing my DVD of Midnight Run because of the ""matted"" format used on the DVD.  Needless to say, the HD DVD is presented in the 1080p/24 standard, and the quality easily exceeds that of the DVD.

However, compared to other titles, Midnight Run is hardly a great measure of HD DVD.  I admit, the quality issue could be due to the degradation of film until it was digitized.  I have seen a limited number of other titles taken from film that are 20 years old, but it seems the studio could have done a better job, even with old film.

This movie was not about the fine cinematography, so I have gotten past the issue.  My rating is for the poor transfer to HD DVD, not the movie itself.  Just understand you will not enjoy the finer points of HD DVD with this purchase...the movie, of course, is as funny as ever.

322445,4,6301221486,"After starring in loads and loads of serious movies in a row, Robert Deniro needed to do something light and felt that Midnight Run was just what he was looking for. Originally a Paramount project, the suits wanted to team him up with Cher for some sex appeal (oh, dear GOD no!) but director Martin Brest (teehee) vehemently opposed this idea and the project ended up at Universal.

The role of Jonathan Mardukas ended up going to deadpan Charles Grodin (though a young Bruce Willis auditioned) since Martin Brest (teehee) felt that he had the best chemistry with Deniro. I'm glad he didn't make that compromise. Can you honestly imagine Midnight Run with Cher??? Deniro is Jack Walsh a tough, ex-cop bounty hunter who is offered $50, 000 by a shady bail-bondsman to capture crooked accountant Jonathan 'The Duke' Mardukas and escort him from NY to LA for a court appearance. The Duke embezzled millions of dollars from crime boss Jimmy Serrano (the always great Dennis Farina) and gave it all to charity so it's not just California justice who wants to get their hands on him. The FBI also want The Duke for their own purposes and The Duke is a clever and cunning enough to chuck as many spanners in the works as possible. So it's not just a simple matter of hopping on a plane...or an easy Midnight Run.

With Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton) another sleazy bounty hunter after them too and loads of double crosses Midnight Run becomes a sort of action/comedy Planes, Trains and Automobiles character drama with enough F-words to give TV censors a nervous breakdown. Back in the stinkin' early 90s the stinkin' BBC dubbed out every stinkin' swear word with the most hilariously awful stinkin' choices. Why? Honestly, this kind of thing makes me wonder what the hell is going on the minds of these censors. Do they honestly think that they're making the world a better place by not exposing full-grown adults to an ancient Anglo-Saxon word for making love? But that's a separate rant altogether.

Those familiar with Brest's (teehee) previous mega-hit Beverly Hills Cop will find a lot of Midnight Run's pacing and cinematography familiar. He is the kind of director that only makes a movie every five years or so but I have a feeling that Gigli has ended his career for good. Don't let that tarnish your feelings toward this film though. Even if Midnight Run didn't have a clever and funny script the chemistry between Deniro and Grodin is worth it alone. We've seen odd-couple buddy/buddy types before but they do it with class.

Although it's nearing 20 years old, Midnight Run seems timeless in way (despite the very liberal 80s attitude towards smoking), mostly because it knows it's nothing but pure entertainment that, for once, isn't dumbed down for the lowest common denominator. These days we get crap like Epic Movie and Talladega Nights. Where did the R-rated comedies go? What grim times we live in.

Not sure about Danny Elfman's score though. Totally the wrong choice of composer, my only complaint.

The HD-DVD sports a 1080p 1.85:1 image that is not entirely perfect. While the daytime scenes surely sparkle, the darker scenes can seem a bit too grainy.

On the journey,(The Ride Back),they are confronted with one threat after another which force them to co-operate with one another just to survive the trip back.

He is hired by an hysterical bondsman to find and bring back a former Mob accountant called Jonathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas (Grodin) who has stolen $15 million from the Los Angeles mob, given the money to the 'unfortunates of the earth.'

DeNiro quickly captures the 'white-collar criminal' in New York, and is given five days to bring him to Los Angleles, to collect his $100,000 fee...

Unfortunately for DeNiro, the fugitive accountant is too neurotic to fly the distance... The embezzler's ex-boss wants him badly for knowing all his financial transactions, and agent Yaphet Kotto warns Walsh not to interfere with the FBI's plans to bring the 'Duke' into federal court... And if this isn't enough, there is some third-rate bounty hunter (John Ashton) who is intrigued about DeNiro's special deal...

In an extended cross-country chase, the two men's personalities and relationship develop...

DeNiro shows how to catch talents of improvisation... His cheeky schoolboy look certainly supplies some of the film's lighter moments... He delivers some of the best punchlines, when he replies: 'Well if you don't cooperate, you're gonna suffer from fistophobia.'

Charles Grodin is perfect as the prisoner who gets some of Serrano's records on computer disks, figuring if things got too rough, he could always trade them for his life... He continually gets on DeNiro's nerves, and with his soft and ironic tone of voice he advises Walsh that a restaurant is 'a very tricky investment.' He easily dips into Jack Walsh's life ('Don't you want to be loved?'), wandering about his broken marriage ('Did she hurt you, Jack?'), his habits ('Cigarettes are killers. Put the cigarette out.') and whatever he can think of...

Whenever I need to get in a better mood, I can usually feel better by scening ahead to the ""Where are you?"" scene on this movie, where DeNiro explains to his bail bondsman employer exactly why he's giving a convoluted answer as to his whereabouts. This is the movie I put on just before I take a road trip so I can fully appreciate how comparatively easy I'll have it, flight delays or not. Robert DeNiro, playing ex-cop Jack Walsh, is assigned the seemingly easy task of finding and retrieving John Mardukas, an innocuous accountant who, until recently, was keeping the books for a mob boss - until he discovered who his employer actually is, upon which discovery Mardukas promptly relieves the Mob of 15 million dollars and goes to ground, skipping bail in the process. Walsh, a savvy detective, has no problem locating the accountant, but that's the last time in the movie he's free of problems - everything goes that way. Not only are there three other agencies after Mardukas - the Mob wants to kill him, the Feds want him to testify, and the bail bondsman has sicced another, stupider bounty hunter on the guy also - travel options become an increasing problem, and Walsh slowly begins to appreciate that his quarry is remarkably clever as well. As played by Charles Grodin, hands down one of the all time best comic actors for playing close-to-the-vest stonefaced characters, the accountant Mardukas is wickedly sharp at throwing monkey wrenches into Walsh's plans and in just generally driving him nuts, continually badgering him about smoking and asking him why he isn't a Chicago cop anymore; the interaction between the two, as they gradually gain a respect for each other, is as good a character development as any movie I've seen. Added to the mix are stellar performances by Yaphet Kotto, as an FBI boss beset by incompetent lackeys and frustration at Walsh's ability to remain one step ahead, and Dennis Farina, as the mob boss in the same boat, having to deal with two particularly laughable hit men. No matter what role Farina takes, though they're pretty much the same, good guy or bad guy, he's always entertaining to watch. The hapless accountant, at the center of all the insanity, views events with a blank incredulity until an opportunity arises for him to affect the plot, when his expression changes to a crafty consideration of his options. A caveat to the sensitive; once I attempted to count the number of times the ""f"" word was used and gave up; I admonished my mother to pay no attention to it and just enjoy the story. (For the record, she got over it.) Language these days is not so much of an issue, but for those who might turn away from this funny movie because of it - I'd offer the same advice.

Moscone agrees to pay big bucks to Walsh for bringing back mob accountant and bail jumper Jonathan (The Duke) Mardukas played by Charles Grodin.

322475,5,6301221486,"Sounds blasphemous when you consider we're talking about the man who's still considered the best actor in America.  But the truth is that in recent years Robert De Niro has appeared in dozens of lousy movies he must be doing to cash in on his credibility.  Maybe he has his eye on a happy retirement paved with Hollywood dollars.  If so, fine, more power to him, but a shame he has squandered his talents so profligately.  MIDNIGHT RUN from way back in 1988 was nearly the last time I can remember him playing well in a good picture.  He was on a sort of streak, having just come off of BRAZIL, THE MISSION, THE UNTOUCHABLES and ANGEL HEART-not all of them classics, but movies with a certain ambition and striving for something far beyond MEET THE PARENTS.  After MIDNIGHT RUN there would be STANLEY & IRIS and GOODFELLAS, and then the catastrophic drop off into near-total mediocrity.  Although to be fair HEAT, JACKIE BROWN and RONIN have their partisans.

And talk about drop off points, what happened to Charles Grodin?  Grodin was always going to be harder to cast than De Niro, that's not his fault, but in MIDNIGHT RUN he matches De Niro so perfectly, note for note, scene for scene, that it's exhilarating to watch him.  He does the kind of thing someone like John Lithgow became famous for, only he does it with the stagy hamminess Lithgow does it with.  And yet Grodin hasn't made a movie in ten years or more, and that was probably better than some of the schlock he was doing, the ""Beethoven"" movies for example, or the execrable I MARRIED AN AXE MURDERER.  Or how about the inexcusable ""The Muppets Go To Walt Disney World""?  Maybe there's a graylist going on right now where real talent is given the silent squelch.  Seems like Grodin can't even get a part in MEET THE PARENTS, really much more his kind of movie than De Niro's.

322478,5,6301221486,"Unless you've got a serious allergy to foul language, movies really don't come any better than 1988's ""Midnight Run"".  George Gallo's script is intricate and ingeniously detailed, and the top notch cast including Robert De Niro, Charles Grodin, Yaphet Kotto, John Ashton, Dennis Farina, and Joe Pantoliano really go to town with it.  Of course, director Martin Brest of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" fame did an incredible of a job as well (he makes a cameo appearance in the movie as well).  There are so many little details that perhaps seem irrelevant at first, but the way things end up coming together is uncanny--it's the kind of movie you could watch 5 times and still notice a detail that previously went over your head.  The pairing of De Niro as the tempermental Jack Walsh with Charles Grodin as the deadpan Jonathan Mardukas (aka ""The Duke"") is uncanny, and Dennis Farina, formerly of the Chicago Police Department, is characteristically brilliant.  Even the soundtrack is cool and meshes brilliantly with scene after scene.  With the great drama, suspense, and hilarity (including a number of classic one-liners) that run throughout this cross-country romp, this is an action-adventure-comedy of the best kind; hell, it even works great as a thriller.  Grodin's 'big moment' here is the hilarious ""Litmus Configuation"" scene which fondly recalls a similar scene with him in it from 1972's ""The Heartbreak Kid"".  I also want to point out that, with the surprisingly bittersweet ending, the relatively low amount of violence, and the fact that none of the 'good guys' die, ""Midnight Run"" ends up being a borderline feel-good movie.

This DVD release is very nicely done--thankfully, it's in widescreen format, and also features the theatrical trailor which contains some bits left out of the finished movie, and a very entertaining and insightful ""Making of 'Midnight Run'"" as well.",1117152000,3,1883,5.127450980392157

322481,5,6301221486,"I really can't suggest anything that would make this film better.  The acting is top notch, not just from DeNiro and Grodin, but from the entire cast.  Each character is well defined and believable. I especially liked Dennis Farina's parody of the tough-talking Mafia boss (""Shut up or I'll shove this pencil through your heart!""), and his two flunkies (Moron #1 and Moron #2). The dialogue is great, and the film is laced with humor--the best kind of humor, situational.  There is even a tender awkward moment (when Jack, DeNiro, visits his daughter whom he hasn't seen in years, and she offers to give him her babysitting money, which he feels he shouldn't take, although he needs it).  The action is non-stop, and if you have to suspend your disbelief at times, it is a small price to pay.

The evolution of the relationship between DeNiro and Grodin's characters, as has been mentioned, is the core of this picture. It is done magnificently and is the reason the film is so great. There are so many great scenes: when DeNiro and Grodin are eating dinner on the train, when they pretend to be from the Treasury Department in order to relieve a bartender of his ""counterfeit"" 20 dollar bills, the scene in the diner when Grodin, really hungry and broke, asks what's the special today, and the waitress says chorizo and eggs (dig the look on Grodin's face). DeNiro says they can't afford it, and Grodin counters ""How about your cigarettes?"", and DeNiro says, ""I need these.""  The film is chock full of these delicious scenes--I really can't think of a dull one.

322504,4,6301221486,"This 1988 film directed by Martin Brest ('Beverly Hills Cop') and a script by George Gallo brings the talents of Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin in a mob-action movie that is sprinkled with the right dosage of humor and wit.

Robert DeNiro is a bounty hunter who's tired of his high-risk/stress job; he wants to retire and open a restaurant. His hopes for the future never seem brighter when a sleazy bail bond agent gives him the go-ahead to find Charles Grodin's character, an anal-rententive/oversentimental accountant whose embezzlement of mafia money makes him a valuable witness and a liability to the mob.  DeNiro's neurotic paranoia simply doesn't jive with Grodin's excessive preoccupations and the two can't get along at all.  With the mob, the FBI, and competing bounty hunters coming after them, both have to set their differences aside until they reach their destination.

A good comedy with a great script carried through by the amazing talent of Grodin and DeNiro. The pair really works well in this film to make it a laughing adventure to watch many times over.",1091750400,2,1078,4.972222222222222

It features some of the most genuinely stupid and amusing tough guys in the history of cinema, and a tantalizing slow burn by Deniro, a shortchanged ex-cop, who just wants a peaceful little coffee shop as payment for his decency and integrity. The comic chemistry between Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin is top-drawer. Surrounded on all side by ethical infants, these two characters at least know the difference between virtue and vice, and are ironically the moral backbone of the film.
Comedies that don't wallow in their humor are twice as much fun, and Midnight Run maintains a swift pace throughout. Situation-wise, it's a dynamo of action. I found the denouement to be quite moving as well, at the very least it provokes thought.
If you're looking for a comedy with depth, bite, wit and excitement, then catch Midnight Run. The DVD's spiffy special features quite simply reinforce my recommendation of purchasing this one, not just renting.",1081296000,53,1048,4.926553672316384
322506,5,6301221486,"The story focuses on a man that has jumped bail named Johnathan ""The Duke"" Mardukas ( Charles Grodin). Mardukas is the ex-account of a Las Vegas mob boss named Jimmy Serrano ( Dennis Farina). The Duke embezzled millions of dollars from Serrano and gave it away to charity before being arrested. Eddie Marcone (Joe Pantoliano)is the bail bondsman that bailed The Duke out of jail. Marcone only has 5 days left, before the bond is forfieted and he is out $100,000. So he sends bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert DeNiro)to retrieve The Duke and bring him back. Unfortunately, Jimmy Serrano wants The Duke dead, and sends two hitmen to kill him. Not to mention the fact that the F.B.I. want to be the ones who bring The Duke to justice. If things couldn't get any worse, there is also a rival bounty hunter named Marvin ( John Ashton)who is trying to bring The Duke in himself. Now it is up to Jack to keep The Duke alive and in one piece, while avoiding Marvin, the FBI, and the two mafia hitmen that are hot on their tails. However, with The Duke constantly trying to escape Jack's custody, Jack begins to realize that he is in for much more than he bargained for.
Midnight Run is without a doubt the best ""buddy"" film ever made. The reason is because Jack and The Duke's friendship takes the whole movie to develop. Nothing about their relationship is cut and dry. The Duke will do something to make Jack like him one minute, and then upset him the next with repeated escape attempts. The film also features the perfect mix of action and comedy as well. There are certain points in the film that are extremely funny and entertaining. The dialogue in this film is first rate. Then you are also drawn into the film because there are so many obstacles Jack and The Duke must overcome on their way to L.A.. There are tons of close calls in this film. The two mafia hitmen, the FBI, and Marvin the bounty hunter are all equally close to catching up with them. Robert DeNiro has had a lot of great performances. However, I still feel after all these years that his performance in ""Midnight Run"" is one of the best he ever gave. Charles Grodin manages to be just as good, and even better than DeNiro at times. DeNiro and Grodin's personalities are so different, that they end up making the perfect pair.
After all these years, ""Midnight Run"" is still a favorite of mine. I have seen the film many times, and it seems to get better after each viewing. Overall, the film features first rate laughs, an action packed story, and great performances from DeNiro, Grodin, Dennis Farina, and Joe Pantoliano. This is definately a must own film.

322508,4,6301221486,"Remember the days when Robert De Niro doing a comedy was considered an anamoly? It's scary to think that there is a whole generation of filmgoers who are going to only known this great actor from generic comedies like Showtime and Analyze This. I guess it's all George Gallo's fault. He wrote the awesome screenplay for Midnight Run, which I'm sure is what attracted De Niro to the film in the first place.
This is one of those super rare comedies that remains funny even after you've watched it a zillion times. The running gags (De Niro impersonating Yaphet Kotto's FBI agent) are never overused and even the minor characters (the two lunkhead gangster thugs who pursue De Niro and Grodin cross-country) are fully-realized and have their own scenes to shine.
Of course, the number one reason why this film works so well and holds up to repeated viewings is the chemistry between De Niro and Grodin. At first, De Niro's hardened, jaded bounty hunter can't stand Grodin's anal-retentive, annoying accountant. However, as the two travel across country and escape from death several times, they begin to bond and almost become friends. The many scenes that De Niro and Grodin share are so good because they are given time to flesh out their respective characters and develop their relationship so that you actually care what happens to them. Yes, there are the requisite car chases and shoot-outs but not as many you see nowadays where it's all wall-to-wall action sequences with little to zero attention paid to character or decent dialogue.
This was also Martin Brest's last great film. Since Midnight Run he's been absorbed by Hollywood and been the victim of several compromised films (Meet Joe Black, Scene of a Woman, Gigli) where his original vision was butchered by a studio that thought they knew better. Oh well...
This DVD is good but could've had more extras added instead of the slim selection we get. Still, it's great to get a letterboxed copy of this film that had been long out of print on DVD. Do yourself and a favour and check this movie out. De Niro's never been funnier and Grodin's never been better. A comedic masterpiece.",1062460800,4,2144,4.813008130081301

Good choices, one and all. But how about something a little less obvious?
I give you, ""Midnight Run."" No, it's not one you'd first think of, and in fact was overlooked during the AFI's recent celebration of Robert DeNiro's work. But ""Midnight Run"" IS a classic. Funny, intelligent, witty, this is a film for individuals whose sense of humor is matched by their i.q. and appreciation for perfect timing - something that DeNiro and co-star Charles Grotin display time and time again throughout this gem.
Director Martin Brest perfectly tempers comedy with action in the tale of bounty hunter, Jack Walsh (De Niro) and 'white collar criminal,' Jonathan Mardukus, a.k.a. ""the Duke"" (Grotin), as they travel across the lower 49 in an attempt to get the Duke to his bail bondsman (cunningly portrayed by Joe Pantoliano). Brest avoids the pitfalls of creating a slap-stick, low-end comedy and pulls off a major win. He allows Robert DeNiro and Charles Grotin both shine as each other's foils.

""So what?"", you may say, and you may be right, but I watched ""Midnight Run"" today after recently seeing the Japanese film ""Ringu"", where the exposition was handled by having one character conveniently endowed with psychic powers so that the screenwriter could have his protaganists magically find out things the viewer needed to know to understand the movie.

Charles Grodin is a masterstroke of casting.  As other points of film (writing, directing, et al) are ""as good as it gets"" (no pun intended, as the tone of ""Midnight Run"" can favorably compare with ""As Good As It Gets"").

Those who've seen it would understand the reason for sure.  Those who haven't seen it before, would feel the same after experiencing this gem out of 80's.
Nothing would be more admireable to me than that feel which caught me right after the film came to the end when I saw it for the very first time.  Well...I know Jack(De Niro) said goodbye to Duke(Grodin). But hey! I don't wanna say goodbye to 2 of them and all the other loveable guys!  This is why I always come back to this movie even though I know it wouldn't be the very same as the first time.  This piece still can be as vital as possible.  Yeah, it's like water and food to me.
You'll find many of tips that let you feel that this is the film made in 80's.  The existence of this film is an evidence that 80's was never the lost decade.  The contents is ageless.
After knowing this excellent piece of film, I've been fighting with desire to tell anyone I know that all the living people should take a bite despite I'm well aware that I can never force them to do so.
Of course, I can't force you to do the same neither.
I, however, would for sure force my child and grand child to do so.",1012953600,2,1197,4.133620689655173

Now at the grand old age of 34 and a million action films later...  I stand corrected!!!
But language aside it was a great film!!!

This is one of the funniest comedies of all time, but it also has a poignant, true feel to it.
Also features great supporting performances from Yaphet Kotto at an FBI inspector and Dennis Farina as a mobster.

Brest's directing is superb - just as it was in *Beverly Hills Cop*.  The movie was very well written by George Gallo.  And the often-bluesy music score by Danny Elfman goes so well with this film.

A rival bounty hunter, mob goons and FBI agents are also after him.  The way in which these various elements cross paths and converge for a suspenseful finale is just one of the marvels of this well-constructed script.  The interplay between DeNiro and Grodin is even more wonderful.  There are no jokes here, but the two characters are so well-drawn and mismatched that the laughs are inherent in the situation.

322550,4,6301221486,"Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin star is this action-packed suspense thriller with a touch of comedy in between. Bounty hunter Jack Walsh (De Niro) is in pursuit of a hypochondriac-type accountant named Jonathan Mardukas (Grodin), whom Walsh gains custody and must return Mardukas from New York to L.A. in order to collect a $100,000 reward. The two men encounter intrigue and danger on this journey, and switch to various modes of transportation to keep the F.B.I. off their trail. Although the writers of the script tried to make this picture into a comedy, the action and suspense overshadow the few comedy scenes, so they (the comedy scenes) don't come out too good in the wash. Even though the intrigue keeps ""Midnight Run"" moving at a rather slow pace, there's somewhat of a climactic build-up toward the end that may keep you on the edge of your seat. De Niro's straight character combined with Grodin's introverted comedy character give the film's script an even balance, although in various scenes Grodin's character proves to be just as straight as De Niro's. If you like your movies with an overabundant ""cops and robbers"" feel, then ""Midnight Run"" will suit you just fine. Add it to your must-have video library!",977529600,,1225,4.9227053140096615
322551,5,6301221486,"If you merely read a dry plot description of this film it would seem to be just another in a seemingly endless parade of buddy buddy fish out of water formula action genre pictures.
You got your bounty hunters, mob guys, feds, car chases, shoot-outs, and characters spewing out profanities like  East Coast dock workers directed by (the guy who helped make Eddie Murphy a huge star with Beverly Hills Cop,)Martin Brest.  (And take note, the film features lots of profanity.)
What makes this a genuine 24 karat hit among the fools gold of its genre is its actors.  Robert DeNiro and Charles Grodin you expect to be pretty good of course, but their chemistry together is that rare cinematic commodity when two seemingly incongruent stars mesh perfectly playing off each others strengths and weaknesses in a comic dance that only a few comedy teams (Laurel and Hardy for instance) enjoyed.  DeNiro never steps out of character or alters his timing to get or milk a laugh.  While Grodin could be accused of doing this in a few scenes, it remains remarkable he more than holds his own literally handcuffed to Robert DeNiro for most of the films running time.
Together they bring scenes to life and get laughs in remarkable ways.  A great example of this is in a scene taking place in a bus-station.  DeNiro is trying to put a bus ticket on his credit cart (which he doesn't realize has been cancelled).  When the credit card doesn't work, he gets angry at the lady behind the ticket counter and tries to use the FBI badge he borrowed to get him a ticket.  But the lady of course realizes the badge is a phony.  Charles Grodin as Duke who is handcuffed to DeNiro, doesn't say a word.  Yet while DeNiro gets frustrated and almost verbally abuses the woman behind the counter Grodin is able to bind with the woman by some sympathetic facial gestures which almost immediately makes the woman behind the counter trust him completely..  It's a classic scene. . . yet it's classic only because of what the actors' are doing, playing off each other.  Later Grodin takes command to scam some money from a small tavern so they can eat.  He's masterful in the scene though leaves ample room for DeNiro to be an integral part of the humor of the scene.  But the actors are working as a team, not trying to top each other at all.
Now I could stop right here and you'd probably agree it sounds pretty promising.  But there's more.  Every single supporting actor in this film is near-perfect.  While a couple of the characters are written as buffoonish henchmen type, even the actors portraying these wise guy low-lifes add a dimension you wouldn't believe possible.  Let's give some quick kudo's to Joe Pantoliano (once upon a time of Hill Street Blues, and recently of The Matrix), Dennis Farina, John Ashton,and Yaphet Koto.  Even Phillip Baker Hall shows up well cast as mob boss Farina's legal counsel.
The reason everyone seems to be at the top of their game has a lot to do with director Martin Brest, who consistently lets his actors `breathe' and have moments and pauses to add bits of nuance to their performances.  He really did a wonderful job of this in Going in Style and even succeeded in turning what easily could have been a chaotic mess, Beverly Hills Cop (since it was originally written for Stallone), into an enjoyable action comedy.  Just look at the failed sequels without Brest at the helm.
As a screenplay, 1988's Midnight Run is almost formula `high concept' stuff.  There's a nice set up and some well written lines from writer George Gallo (which is nothing to sneeze at) , but mostly it's the actors, director and film editor that give the material all of its juice.  It helps that you've got some great get boogie- blues theme music from Danny Elfman, which is used to get some additional laughs.
 Robert  De Niro plays bounty hunter Jack Walsh, an ex-Chicago cop who negotiates a $100,000 fee from  a Los Angeles bail bondsman (Joe Pantoliano)  if he can bring in Jonathan `the Duke' Mardukas (Charles Grodin), an accountant who ran off with $15 million belonging to  mobster (Dennis Farina) within 5 days.
Almost immediately Walsh knows this isn't like any case he's every taken before.  He has a history with Chicago mobster which somehow ended his police career in Chicago.  There's also the FBI who suddenly know he might be trying to find the Duke, and they want him to turn the guy over to them if he finds him.  F.B.I. agent Alonzo Mosely (Yaphet Kotto) tries to scare Jack Walsh a little bit, which ends in Walsh borrowing Alonzo's i.d.
Walsh cleverly and very quickly tracks down Mardukas (Grodin) and tries to take him on an airplane to Los Angeles. Two mob goons (Richard Foronjy and Robert Miranda) show up and offer to pay Walsh off to hand over the Duke.  Walsh will have none of this and gets the Duke onto the airplane safely.  But the Duke starts acting odd, telling Walsh he has a problem with flying.  When he begins to hyperventilate, they are booted off the plane.
Waiting for the plane in Los Angeles are the bail bondsman and FBI guy Alonzo Mosely.  However Walsh and the Duke aren't on the plane..  The bail bondsman hires another bounty hunter (John Ashton) to track him down, the FBI rush off following a lead.
What follows is a succession of chases by  train, helicopter and  automobile in which the mob goons, bounty hunter, and F.B.I.  try to catch up with the pair.
As Walsh and the Duke rush to get to Los Angeles and avoid everyone who is after them, the Duke constantly whines and needles Walsh for personal information which he might somehow be able to use to manipulate Walsh and escape.  A bond is formed between the men, and a respect slowly grows between them.  None of this aspect of the film should come as any surprise, since it's part of the formula of the standard buddy picture.  At first the two `buddies' hate each other and then learn to accept each other, and then come to respect each other. Grodin and DeNiro manage to play very real and quite endearing characters, finding a natural humor in their situation and relationship that is infectious.
What is surprising is how funny and even warm this exciting action comedy actually is.  Midnight Run is a film that should be on your list of must-sees.  Don't miss it.

Unfortunately for him though, not only his bounty ann incessant pain in the ass but he's also got the mob, the Feds and another bounty hunter all trying to stop him collecting his pay check. Midnight Run is a rare gem, a top class action comedy with one of the most unusual screen ""buddy"" partnerships in cinematic history, which has sadly been somewhat overlooked by the majority of people and that's a great shame because it boasts great characters, great comedy, great action scenes, a wonderful plot and a brilliant script with stand-out performances from Dennis Farina, Charles Grodin and in particular Robert De Niro who proves what a great comedic (as well as character) actor he is. Expertly directed by Martin Brest, who directed Beverly Hills Cop (and Scent Of A Woman), this is in my opinion a much better movie than the much lauded Eddie Murphy movie and a must see, particularly if you are a fan of Robert De Niro. In fact it is so good I'd give the movie five stars if it weren't for the lack of extras on the DVD but (especially at a budget price) this is definitely one well worth adding to your collection.",973814400,17,1262,4.5394736842105265
322554,4,6301221486,"I went to see ""Midnight Run"" in the theatres when it first came out in 1988, and wondered to myself: ""Who is this funny man, this Robert DeNiro?  He's a hoot!""  I was 13-years old, and probably hadn't had much exposure to his most recent work (""Angel Heart"", ""The Untouchables"", and ""The Mission"" being a little over my head at the time), so what did I know?  Well, it's 12 years later, and I still think that ""funny man"" DeNiro gives a great performance here as a bounty hunter ex-cop at the end of his rope, desperate for the big payoff.  He meets Charles Grodin's ex-mob accountant who, in a contrived plot twist, is afraid of flying.  So they must drive across country to collect the bounty.  And like every good movie road trip, the two men learn to work together, and even to like each other.
Hmm.  Reminds me of a parallel-universe ""Rain Man"", no?
All that being said, this is a very funny movie.  Grodin and DeNiro are the quintessential (to beat to death a tired phrase) odd couple.  Grodin, the fussy shnook and DeNiro the wizened and weakened curmudgeon.  They play off each other (with the help of a great script by George Gallo) extremely well.  The comedy even manages to overcome the frequent moments of mayhem and destruction.  It all balances well.
The supporting cast is quite good.  Yaphet Kotto as a beleaguered FBI agent tracking the pair exhibits cool authority.  John Ashton as a shotgun-toting rival bounty hunter is manic and bullheaded and quite funny as well.  And Dennis Farina plays the mob boss, whose desperation is almost as palpable as his frustration with his incompetent underlings.  They are all pawns here, moved around the board expertly through plot twists and double crosses, helping to create a very entertaining movie.",970617600,3,1760,4.721311475409836

There's something happening every minute in this  cross-country caper, and the cast--which also includes John Ashton, Yaphet  Kotto, Dennis Farina and Joe Pantoliano--cannot be faulted. Yet it is the  constant bickering banter between tough guy De Niro and prissy Grodin--who  split the difference between Laurel & Hardy and Butch Cassidy & the  Sundance Kid--which makes this movie truly outstanding.",968803200,4,785,5.413223140495868
