8284300,5,B00077287O,"This collection is incredible. Lots of rare footage and TV appearances/performances, an entire concert documentary, the majority of The Rat's music/promo videos (unfortunately does not have the video for ""Living In An Island""), and my personal favorite, footage from the 1977 Music Machine performance. The incident where a concert goer went onstage during ""(She's Gonna) Do You In"" and punched Geldof in the face, sending him flying as the rest of the band watches in horror. Geldof recovers and like it was nothing, finishes the song. I've seen photos of this, but I had no idea actual video footage of it existed, and I'm glad it does! Geldof is without a doubt the absolute coolest. This DVD is so awesome, I payed $40 for it and even before I finished watching the entire DVD I knew it was well worth that much money.
Do beware: the region 2 PAL so unless your DVD player is region 2 it won't play on your TV's DVD player, However, since it's PAL it will play on newer computer DVD drives. This DVD is amazing and a must have for any fan of The Boomtown Rats. Geldof is THE master, and the Rats are truly the greatest band of all time. I'll defend those statements to the death.",1422057600,,1183,4.5327102803738315
8284301,4,B00077287O,"The Boomtown Rats, an originally 6 piece outfit from the suburbs of Dublin, rode the crest of the punk/new wave era in the late 70's to become the first new wave band to hit the upper echelons of the British charts with the single ""Rat Trap"" in 1978 closely followed by the song they became most identified with ""I Don't Like Mondays"" (which was actually banned by most U.S. radio stations at the time).

By the time the group disbanded in 1986, their commercial successes were long behind them and frontman Bob Geldof would take his repulsion at famine-striken Ethiopia to pop culture heights with Live Aid, his own subsequent solo career and a bestselling autobiography. What is largely forgotten about the group however, is that they were at the forefront of the pre-video explosion in the late 1970's and created some of the most innovative and compelling videos at a time when the medium itself had barely come to life. While David Bowie's contribution to music videos is unparalleled, bands like the Boomtown Rats created stimulating and stirring visual recreations of their music well before the advent of MTV.

""The Boomtown Rats on Film 1976-1986"", released to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the band's formation, succeeds in bringing the group's visual ouvre to a new generation while at the same time vividly recreating a historic period in pop culture in Britain where the punk movement created a vivid and often disturbing counterculture to the sacharine sounds of disco. Classic conceptual videos like ""I Don't Like Mondays"" and ""Bannana Republic"" counter brash performance pieces like ""Someone's Looking At You"" and ""Diamond Smiles"", all of which were top 20 chart successes in the U.K. at the time. More conventional videos of the mid-80's follow but the real gem of the DVD are the extras including the band's television premiere on the late Mark Bolan's afterschool pop music preview show in 1977 where the group performs it's debut single ""Looking after No. 1"" in all it's brash,punk, to-hell-with-authority smugness. And for anyone who ever questioned the Boomtown Rats as an effective live act, the group's final performance at the Self-Aid benefit concert in Ireland in May of 1986 performing ""Joey's On the Street Again"" (including a brief nod to Woody Guthrie's ode to the unemployed)rounds out the DVD on a positive and memorable note.

The Boomtown Rats never achieved a fraction of the success they enjoyed in the U.K. in the United States and yet without them, other Irish acts like U2 might not have achieved their degree of fame and fortune. ""The Boomtown Rats on Film"" is an excellent evocation of an era in which both music and video came together in new and exciting ways. For anyone interested in the new wave and what it meant at the time, the DVD is an indispensible addition to that understanding while at the same time it contains truly unique and compelling videos that were complety ahead of what most other acts were doing. Highly recommended",1156896000,2,2986,4.932405566600398
8284302,2,B00077287O,"I would've given this DVD 5 stars for the ammount of videos & TV appearances on it, but you cost me 3 cause of the fact that you lied to me about the NTSC format description.

I ordered it from my small-chain record shop & it came in.

I found out it matched the description of the Ebay searches: PAL, region 2!

So next time, check your forieng DVDs twice for default formatting before posting them on this website.

& if Universal Music USA issues this here in a NTSC All Regions version, I""ll definately be able to give it 5 stars cause I'll be able to play it on my home theatre system.",1149206400,3,590,4.149122807017544
