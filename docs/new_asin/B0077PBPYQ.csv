5061740,2,B0077PBPYQ,"I was looking forward to a very different type of approach to the secrets of the manor houses - a bit more of the actual historical secrets, of which I'm sure there are many.  To me, it felt mostly like a criticism of the way of life of the Edwardian society. Totally different from the ""Treasure Houses of Britain"" which takes you on tours of these wonderful historical houses and takes the time to show you the treasures in each one of them.  Not my cup of tea!!",1349049600,25,464,4.261363636363637
5061741,4,B0077PBPYQ,"The span of social elements attempted in this DVD is impressive. Unfortunately, sixty minutes is insufficient to really provide detail. The viewer comes away with many questions. Notwithstanding that, if you want an entry level primer into British society that references pre-Edwardian periods and is relatively inconclusive on post-Edwardian periods, this may be for you. Well narrated and beautiful country house footage - it just attempted much and was edited down to a beginner level.",1336348800,29,488,5.52
5061742,4,B0077PBPYQ,"""Secrets of the Manor House"" hops on the Downton Abbey train with a detailed look at life both upstairs and downstairs during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The stunning houses featured are enough to convince those well-versed in the period (like me!) to add this to one's DVD collection, and for those new to the period, the documentary is a great visual intro to Edwardian social history. This is an excellent companion to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-of-Downton-Abbey/dp/1250006341/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World of Downton Abbey</a>, and is likely to whet one's appetite for more Edwardiana!",1335312000,51,666,6.25

5061746,5,B0077PBPYQ,This documentary explores the world of the wealthy and their servants around the turn of the century up to WWI. It's fascinating and gives the viewer a chance to hear the factual story of how this world functioned as opposed to the filtered version of TV and movies. Loved it!,1395619200,,276,4.54
5061747,5,B0077PBPYQ,"This documentary is very enlightening about the oligarchy that ruled England and Great Britain for centuries.  As Americans we tend to equate our nation and freedoms with England, and that is not justified. Theirs is not a complete democracy but rather a rule by the aristocracy which is still powerful, though perhaps less than centuries past.  The common Englishman or Scot was brainwashed by the culture to be subservient to the landlord class and the oligarchy and to make no demands.  This shows in clear layers of a hierarchy from the lowly kitchen maid through the ranks of the service class to the top of the pyramid. Actually this documentary is a necessary tie-in to dramas that glamorize the lifestyle of the very rich and downplay  how downtrodden the servant and laborer were.  It is a must see for educators and students of history, government,  and literature.  The positions of authority were the privilege of the upper classes alone for centuries.  Even today---as the documentary shows---the structure, wealth, and land ownership of the elite is great.  Laws and culture protect their privileges.

5061748,5,B0077PBPYQ,"This also gives a fascinating insight into how our ancestors the commoners lived in large manor houses. There were separate doors and hidden staircases inside some of the houses so that servants could not be seen or heard, even going so far in one manor house as to construct an underground passage leading from one part of the building to another, all again, for the purpose of servants going about their daily chores unseen. There were separate staircases for male and female servants, and they were strictly segregated. Anyone caught fraternising could be instantly dismissed. And they were paid a poultry 50 ($82.90) a year! Mind you, that bought alot more than it would now.
 If an owner or family member or guest came into one of the rooms and a servant was around, the servant had to move out of the way so that s/he could not be seen. You can see where some fabulously rich people and dictators got some of their ideas from when constructing their own mansions and in treating their staff! A great watch for curiosity value and an interesting commentary on social history of the time up to 1914.",1390867200,,1103,4.656410256410257

5061751,4,B0077PBPYQ,"This was enlightening.  I love all things British.  I learned watching this and was amazed at how
these landowners needed rich American wives whose fathers were more than eager to oblige.
Fascinating stuff.",1384300800,,206,5.212121212121212
5061752,1,B0077PBPYQ,"I was very disappointed with the obvious bias of this documentary.  Yes, the wealthy were very wealthy and there was a big gulf between the classes.  But, the film made it look like everyone who worked ""in service"" was angry and bitter about their lot in life.  It kept playing doomsday music and showing over and over one photo where the servants looked just short of insane.  In fact, the people who worked in service had plenty to eat, clothes to wear, and a good roof over their heads, which many poor people at that time yearned for, as evidenced by how many parents sent their children off to work at the manor houses.  What I had hoped to see was information on how the house was managed, how they kept those huge estates in such good condition without electricity and modern tools, and how their supply chain functioned.  I'm definitely sorry I bought this waste of time.",1375488000,18,879,4.531645569620253

5061768,4,B0077PBPYQ,Nicely done documentary about life in the manor house back in the 1800's and turn of the century. Explains why things were the way they were back then. I enjoyed it.,1362268800,3,165,4.354838709677419
5061769,5,B0077PBPYQ,"Found it very interesting. as my mother was in service in the late 1920's in England she was a house maid and made about 5shillings a week of which she kept a shilling and would have to send the other 4shillings home to her mum and dad she only had one half day a  week off, all the help worked very hard as there was no central heating and no electric,it's very hard to imagine how you would run a big house from scratch guess thats why they had so much help almost slave labor compared to work conditions today But she never thought she was hard done by cause they did eat well",1358985600,27,579,4.078947368421052

5061771,5,B0077PBPYQ,"PBS has a well deserved reputation for doing documentaries right, and that certainly holds up here. This concerns itself with the manor house lifestyle primarily in the Edwardian era. It examines the period through the social, political, and economic aspects, giving plenty of background on the aristocratic system in England and the life of the servants who kept such places running, stressing the rigid status that had to be adhered to. The documentary also explores the reasons for the decline of the manor society in the wake of monumental change. Highly informative and well worth having a look.",1356652800,10,600,5.13265306122449

8511799,5,B0077PBPYQ,"Manor houses were built in the country and largely still tied to the land. British manor houses boomed in the 1800s, with their heyday in the Edwardian era, up to WWI. ""Secrets of the Manor House"" is about the downstairs, the upstairs, and the seas change that was to come with the advent of manufacturing jobs and the losses of the Great War.

Because, of course, a manor house was run only with the help of many servants. By 1912, there were over 1,500,000 manor servants in England. That's in the house only, and doesn't include gardeners and grooms. As I learned from this show, the decline of the manor house fortunes actually started in the late 1850s, as the balance of financial power started shifting to bankers and financiers. What temporarily staved off the decline was the great wealth coming in from the colonies. After that, there was the huge influx of funds from marriage to American heiresses. One thing I never thought of, the big reason this last was possible was because America did NOT practice primogeniture. If it had, those wealthy fathers could not have showered such huge sums on their marriageable daughters.

Commentators in this show include Dr. Elisabeth Kehoe (author ""The Titled Americans""), Lawrence James (author ""Aristocrats Power: Grace and Decadence""), Geoffrey Dymond (Manderston House butler), The Right Honorable Lord Palmer (4th Baron, Manderston House), Lady Palmer, Professor Jay Walker (history, Yale), Katie Taylor (National Trust, Dunham Massey), Dr. Sarah Richardson (professor history, U of Warwickk), Dr. Matthew Hughes (professor history, Brunel University), Judy Herbert (Petworth House), Mary Gledhill (once 3rd maid to the 3rd Duchess of Westminster), Tarka Leslie-King (Castle Leslie), Captain Sir John Norman Ide (4th Baronet of Glaslough, Castle Leslie) and Gavin Weightman (author ""Children of Light"").

""Secrets of the Manor House"" is mostly about people, but you also get to look inside some beautiful homes. Manderston House, for example, has the Silver Staircase, a stairway with an elegant wrought silver banisters.

This episode in the ""Secrets of the [a big British place]"" series first aired in 2012. It runs 56 minutes and English subtitles are available
 if you buy it on disc. ""Secrets of the Manor House"" is just one in a series. Five of the series' episodes can be purchased in a 5-DVD set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Secrets-of-Iconic-British-Estates/dp/B00KX44RNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Secrets of Iconic British Estates</a>.

I've read a lot of British history and own quite a few books on its palaces and great houses. And I still learned interesting stuff from this video. One last sobering thought, most of the British soldiers who died in WWI did not have the right to vote, because they weren't landowners. Another reason for change.

8511800,1,B0077PBPYQ,"This was not a movie, which I thought it was, (I confused the CD title with movie The Old Dark House, with Boris Karloff, which I really wanted to see), and I was totally disappointed.

8511804,4,B0077PBPYQ,"First, this documentary provides an interesting look at some of the nuances of Edwardian life, from the perspective of landed gentry and the servants who worked for them. HOWEVER, the social dynamic is limited by the simple fact that it is not 1900 any longer. The people who play the parts of gentry and servants are volunteers from the twenty-first century. As such, their behaviors are modern -- they challenge authority, leave their jobs when they get too difficult, blow off work, and challenge their employers. This simply wouldn't have been done. To lose your job without a reference would be to face starvation at worst and public shame at the least. That said, the program provides a window into how hard life was for servants, how unfair it could be for women, and how unloving it could be for well-born children.",1421971200,2,823,4.802816901408451
8511805,1,B0077PBPYQ,"What an odd show.  First things first, the title has absolutely nothing to do with the content of the show.  Yes, there are some photos of some manor houses mixed into the commentary but there are photos and film clips of virtually everything that took place from 1870-1920 in Britain.  Very little of it had much to do with the manor houses that are ostensibly the stars of the show.  We get a useless detour into the Titanic, where we learn that the rich and poor travelled in different classes.  There's a random discussion of imperialism and the British Empire, which the narrator tries to tie back into the central story by somehow saying that the great landowners of Britain became the great landowners of the colonies as well, which is absolutely not true.  And it ends with a long discussion on World War I, with some professor telling us that the war caused great damage in Europe.  And then suddenly, it's over.  Somehow the war caused the end of the aristocracy and the manor houses all go to rot.  Is it because they all died in the war?  No, the show just decides to tie the two together and say goodbye.  Not one mention of taxes, or the economy, which were the real culprits.  And the entire show is marred by doomsday music that would be more appropriate in a horror flick.  Lots of rich vs poor stuff but it's all so superficial that really you'd need to know virtually nothing of history to find this remotely educational.

The show was also obviously put together on a very small budget and tight timeframe.  The same photos and clips are used again and again, the same talking heads reappear to say things that are blindingly obvious.  And the events and places that are used to tell the ""story"" are so random.  There's a section on Americans marrying into the aristocracy which is a real phenomenon.  But the only example they had was some American woman unknown to me marrying a baronet living in a comparatively sad little house in Ireland.  It seems like they had access to a handful of actually relevant people, interviewed them, then padded out the show with stock history footage of soldiers, suffragettes and coal miners until they got an hour long show.

If you want to hear again and again that the rich lived better than the poor, and you knew absolutely nothing about this phenomenon, this show might be of interest to you.  Anyone who knows anything about social history will find this dull and repetitive.  And for those poor souls who actually wanted to watch a show about manor houses and how they were run, don't be deceived by the title, there's nothing to see here.",1421452800,4,2604,4.578833693304536
