This film is what indie filmmaking used to be all about! It is funny, heartfelt, disturbing, and highly entertaining. I cannot recommend it enough. The only negative thing I can say is that once you watch this film, you will want to watch others like it...and, I hate to break it to you, but, there is nothing else like this film. Yes, it is that unique.

As wild and off-the-wall as this film gets, Kris Canonizado still manages to handle the subject matter so delicately, that it gives the film a massive, beating heart.

Highly recommended!
