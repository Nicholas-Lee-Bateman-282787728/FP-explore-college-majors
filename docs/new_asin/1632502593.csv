7800736,3,1632502593,"I did learn how to do CRAW.  This was definitely a very basic beginner DVD, which was good, but the price is way too high for the content.  Twenty dollars would have been much more reasonable.",1444694400,,192,4.305555555555555
7800737,3,1632502593,"For the very beginner. I've only been dabbling in CRAW (Cubic Right Angle Weave) for about 6 weeks and I didn't really pick up any new hints or tricks. I was hoping to learn more about shapes - I'd already made a circle and a square, don't really have a use for ellipses (I don't make earrings.) Had to figure out on my own how to make a heart (BTW, works very well with a count of 14 ""side,"" beads and making two right angle turns in the same direction.) At least I found out I already had acquired the skills needed to do more exploring of color combos on my own. A video that I do recommend is Jill Wiseman's  Beaded Ropes (same series as this one.) I learned much more from this DVD.",1442275200,,687,4.088888888888889
