The second half is definately an improvement over the first, but not enough for me to really recommend it. The movie is sort of a cross between Misery and Fatal Attraction, with very little originality. Also the character of Alice is both stupid and nuts.",1237766400,,382,4.632352941176471
8251022,5,B0013HQLLG,"I enjoyed this film.  It was a slow-burn horror film.  I  thought the acting was incredible.  The camera-work was well done and the lighting was good.  The story was troubling and dark.  I watched this film in anticipation of the next scene throughout the film.  Yes, it was predictable but honestly, what horror film isn't these days?  The story was a bit of a retelling of May and Misery, but enough differed to make it worth watching.  For those who like their films full of zombies, werewolves, or fast-moving slashers with high body counts, this film will bore you.  But if you like variety in your horror you'll find this cerebral film different and much more enjoyable than any of the remakes and reimaginings done on budgets far greater than Nobody Loves Alice.",1231372800,3,769,4.714285714285714
8251023,5,B0013HQLLG,"I loved this film....it had me on the edge of my seat. The story was unique, thrilling and suspenseful which made me all the more impressed when I found out that this was Roger Scheck's directorial debut. I highly recommend this film and look forward to seeing more of these actors in the future.",1202083200,4,296,4.5
