7927116,3,B00004YA6R,"Americana,"" set in San Francisco, is a thriller about facing the consequences of an ugly past. Two years after alcoholism and depression drove Avery Wells (David Call) from his home and career, the film editor finds himself back in the city, sober and pressured into finishing a cut of a new film  Americana. Avery takes the job due to his connection to the films star  his sister Kate (Kelli Garner)  and the enthusiasm of the films producer, Caleb Andrews (Jack Davenport).

The cut is a mess, but the talented editor can salvage it, all while striving to stay clean and reconnecting with his family. Soon, though, he starts receiving menacing calls from a stranger threatening to reveal his darkest secrets  threats impossible to ignore when tragedy strikes, and Avery, stricken with grief and shame, falls off the wagon.

Though the movie eventually turns into a murder mystery, it primarily hinges on Averys alcoholism and desire for redemption from a terrible accident caused by his addiction to booze. First-time director Zachary Shedd shows skill at balancing Averys personal struggle with his desire to turn snippets of film footage into a cohesive, watchable movie, not a skill anyone can master. The San Francisco locations and first-rate cinematography give the low-budget movie a rich look, and the performances, particularly Calls, are uniformly effective.

There are no bonus features on the unrated, widescreen DVD release.
Americana is also available on demand (VO",1490745600,,1481,5.197478991596639
7927117,4,B00004YA6R,"i saw this one when it came out, then again on tv so i was happy to find it here. im drawn to characters of such introspection and quiet composure. Carradine makes inroads here that will be traveled by many who have felt the devastating gravity of life's fast lane.",1402617600,,265,4.32
7927118,4,B00004YA6R,"Searching for self and values describes the story line.  This is a glimpse of a typical small USA town of the 1970's:  poverty, few jobs, lack of values, no appreciation for the returning Vietnam Veteran.  The carousel represents an America that is long past and only the soldier cares enough to try to resurrect that past. No one else seems to really care much about anything.  It is a good, but sad, story.  There is something terribly wrong with the sound which makes it difficult to hear some of the dialog.",1293408000,,511,4.571428571428571
7927119,4,B00004YA6R,"Made on a shoestring, dircected and starring David Carradine, it's about a Vietnam vet (possibly shell-shocked) who attempts to start up a dilapadated merry-go-round in a small redneck Kansas town, just ""for something to do."" The town can't understand what he's up to, of course, and makes life miserable for him; but he succeeds in the end. Carradine employs a lot of long, quiet introspective scenes (a la the Kung Fu things he did for TV); most are pretty effective. But it's so low key the movie seems incoherent at times. Despite that objection, the movie is a good one and keeps us watching right through to the end.",1126828800,,622,4.715596330275229
7927120,3,B00004YA6R,The sound is terrible! I think the affects channel is on the right and the dialog on the left. The video quality is worse than VHS! How could Rhino do this to such a classic movie?,978739200,,180,4.027777777777778
7927121,4,B00004YA6R,"If you liked Tender Mercies, you'll like this one. Americana is a surprisingly effective movie about a man's quixotic quest for peace and wholeness. Beautifully understated writing and acting. The cinematography is definitely of its time(early 1970's), and the audio sounds like fake stereo. Not letterboxed, so it feels kind of cramped at times. That said, I still recommend it to anyone who likes minimalist movies like Two-Lane Blacktop, Tomorrow and Stranger Than Paradise.",976492800,,477,5.45945945945946
7927122,4,B00004YA6R,"I saw this flick years ago and remember it as an interesting  and sort of sad movie about David Carradine as an ex-Vietnam  loner in a small town. I  think it must be worthwhile if you liked the series Kung-Fu and you are  over 32 years old, you'll like this mellow movie.",967852800,,272,4.173076923076923
