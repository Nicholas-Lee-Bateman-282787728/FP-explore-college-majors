8321921,5,B001MVIJVI,"Craig Boddington is the leading American writer on hunting in Africa.  And this DVD is his masterpiece!

There are two DVDs.  The first DVD is a series of several hunting scenes.  Some are better than others, depending on the situation and the cameraman (his skill or luck).  The best are thrilling and some are just ok.  The second DVD contains the basic information regarding hunting elephants (proper shot placement, where to hunt elephants, etc.).  In a nutshell, the DVD is both entertaining and informative.

This is the best DVD on the market on hunting the African elephant.  I recommend it to anyone interesting in hunting elephants.  And I also recommend it to anyone that is into hunting in Africa.  I bought the DVD for my brother-in-law even though he has never hunted in Africa because the quality is so good that it is of general interest to any serious hunter.

The commentary from Professional Hunter Ivan Carter adds a further level of information and detail that is hard to find elsewhere.",1324166400,,1008,4.830409356725146

8321923,4,B001MVIJVI,"Good video of the hunts. I also own Boddington on Leopards and Boddington on Buffalo and I think both of those do a better job of looking at the firearms and gear but Elephants has better hunt footage.

I enjoyed it.",1237939200,2,216,4.2682926829268295
