6991011,1,B00SJOO5GO,I didn't see that the DVD set was region 2 so I had to return it.,1444780800,2,65,3.125

8698650,1,B00SJOO5GO,"This honestly feels like a scam. Its advertised as being for regions A/B/C. So you watch the first season and everything is fine. Then you try to watch season 2 and suddenly the disc isn't compatible with your player. Of course, at this point when you contact the seller, you get an indifferent response about how you're not within the 30 days of your return policy. In conclusion: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! It is a huge waste. However, I can say that having seen this series before this unfortunate experience, the show itself is great. Just, for your own sake, buy it from another seller.",1520812800,,591,4.584905660377358
8698651,2,B00SJOO5GO,"Season 2 cannot be watched.  It says, this blue ray disk can be played on region B players only.  Season one was fine.  Season 2 in the same box cannot be played!",1519430400,,162,4.0
8698652,3,B00SJOO5GO,"I LOVE Black Sails, but Season 2 won't play on my PS4 because its country coded. Season 1 is fine though. Majorly disappointed cause I had to go back and order Season 2 separately.",1517961600,,180,4.323529411764706
8698653,1,B00SJOO5GO,"I wish i could give this less than 1 star because the product listing is misleading. It is advertised as a Region A/B/C DVD set. Season 1 works fine, but season 2 is strictly Region B. If you live in the US DO NOT BUY this product. Don't be fooled like myself and many other buyers - I now have 4 dvds that will not play on any player, and cannot return them because the seller doesn't accept returns for this reason",1503360000,,416,4.085365853658536
8698654,1,B00SJOO5GO,"Season 1 played without any problems, but Season 2 would not play in my player  They were apparently miss marked and set up for another region.  Very disappointing.",1498521600,,164,4.821428571428571
8698655,1,B00SJOO5GO,"Extremely disappointed...
Season 1 was great...
Season 2 was for Region B Blu-Ray players only!
Absolutely Effin USELESS ",1498435200,,121,5.722222222222222
8698656,5,B00SJOO5GO,I am happy with this deal,1490486400,,25,3.3333333333333335
8698657,1,B00SJOO5GO,What good is buying two seasons and you are unable to watch the second season because you do at live in the right country? This should have been disclosed! I just read I had to have a blu-Ray player. Now that I got through the first season it's too late to return it!,1489968000,2,267,4.056603773584905
8698658,1,B00SJOO5GO,The initial description says Region A/B/C which is deceptive!!!  It states you must have a Blue Ray player but it does not say that it will not play in Region A which is the United States!!!  If you keep going into the product description and the ASIN number it tells you it will not play in the U.S. They should not advertise all Regions on the home page or advertise that it will not play in the U.S.,1488672000,2,402,4.141025641025641
