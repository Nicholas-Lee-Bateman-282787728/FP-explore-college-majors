7996691,3,B0000ADXFF,"An air traffic controller is forced to face the challenge of her life when she has to attempt to guide a dis-abled airplane to a safe landing, not knowing that her hubby is on board.",1204675200,6,182,4.228571428571429
7996692,5,B0000ADXFF,"I saw this film years ago and was so excited to see it finally come out on DVD. The acting is good, plot makes sense, story flows smoothly. An air traffic controller snaps after a close call. He tells his wife, who also works for the same airport, that he needs to get away by himself for a while. She's concerned but lets him go. Meanwhile you see the problems this airport is having with it's antiquated equipment. When hubby takes a commercial flight home, he finds himself under pressure once again. That's the basics and as far as I'll go with the plot. Is it ""Oscar"" material?....probably not. But I've seen a lot of ""Oscar"" films that weren't nearly as good as this one!",1181520000,3,677,4.424
