The plot is simple but with a huge hole which I cannot understand. Alain and Romy are on vacation in the South of France in a superb villa with a great swimming pool. They are having a great week until Maurice Ronet arrives and is invited to stay for few days. Maurice Renee is Romy's old boyfriend. He brings his daughter (Jane Birkin). For approximately one hour and 20 minutes not much is going on except the superb acting of all the three protagonists. Alain Delon is great in building the plot...and the tension is building. Jane Birkin is just a decoration in the entire movie, a tiny voice in the background with no energy (she was never a good actrice and was always promoted because of her father).

Suddenly, everything explodes. And someone dies. However, the plot doesn't make any sense is: why change clothing? Let the body float in the pool with the clothes on! Go to bed. He felt in the pool and drowns because he was drunk. Period.

Great movie, but I wish they wouldn't mess up the plot. They tried to make it PC, Hollywood-like. Maybe they thought at that time that it will sell better in US. What a pity...Make it realistic!

On another note this movie is to be shown in acting classes.",1358640000,,1430,4.57421875
