8031008,3,B0002S64HI,"This Platinum dvd features four entertaining classic B westerns from the 30's and 40's. The main attraction is, Rawhide,1938, starring baseball legend Lou Gehrig in his only movie role, making this a treasure for collectors. Gehrig was still active as a player at the time and retired in 1939, after being diagnosed with ""ALS"". Gehrig left the game with a .340 lifetime batting average and a record 2,130 consecutive games played, of course the great Cal Ripken surpassing this record in 1995. - One notable scene in Rawhide, Gehrig displays his throwing arm in a barroom brawl, rocketing pool balls at the greedy outlaws who are trying to steal his ranch. Just to see Lou Gehrig on the screen makes this film worthwhile.  COLORADO,1940, starring Roy Rogers, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, and Milburn Stone, ""ol' doc from gunsmoke"", sets the stage for Civil War action where two brothers are on opposing sides in this spy mystery. THE CARSON CITY KID,1940, starring Roy Rogers, ""Gabby"" Hayes, and Bob Steele, a masked outlaw on the run seeks revenge for the murder of his younger brother. MAN FROM HELL'S EDGES,1932, starring Bob Steele and ""Gabby"" Hayes, a man wrongly accused of murder escapes from prison and plans to set the record straight to find the right wrongdoer. All these films are old and vintage, so the quality of the tranfers are not great, the sound is good, 5.1, black and white, at a cheap reasonable price.",1235692800,4,1418,4.859504132231405
