8398929,5,B003KT1IRW,"Yes, I'm sure there are a lot of fantastic books available on hydroponics. But books require a greater investment of your time and even if they include illustrations of various hydroponic setups, I think seeing the process in action in a video is more helpful. So wherever you take your hydro research from here, this DVD is a perfect place to start.

Jorge Cervante's DVDs are also very helpful, but focus more specifically on growing cannabis.

Also worth buying in my opinion, if you are interested in growing cannabis or like hydroponics videos in general.

And lastly, if you are interested in mycology, there's a great DVD set called ""Let's Grow Mushrooms!""
Not sure if it's on Amazon or not.",1297814400,2,946,6.105263157894737
