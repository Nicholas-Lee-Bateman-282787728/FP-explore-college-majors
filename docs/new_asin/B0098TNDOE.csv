5277399,1,B0098TNDOE,"I just skimmed through this set to check the picture quality and it's abysmal. My expectations were in check since the maximum space for a movie would be less than 2GB AT THE MOST on a 50GB blu-ray. Many of these films pixelate so badly they were unwatchable on my 5 year old 40 inch TV. I was just hoping for the quality of a VHS rip that you find in so many budget dvd sets, but this set looks worse than any DVD I've seen. It's lower than VCD quality. Don't bother with this set unless you are hardcore collector and this set contains a holy grail for you. If you are a casual spaghetti western fan you are better off getting The Grand Duel/Keoma double feature blu-ray from Mill Creek or Django and Django Kill! from Blue Underground.",1359244800,10,738,4.2785714285714285
5277400,4,B0098TNDOE,"Yes, all the complaints are true. The movies are in good quality, not great, but if you are like me you've gone through many a cheap DVD of spaghetti westerns that looked terrible, at least these movies all look pretty good. Yes, unfortunately it is true that two of these movies are in Italian with no subtitles, a bummer for sure. Other wise this is a cool collection of not often seen movies and the price is unbelievable. If you are fan of Italian genre fare and/or the spaghetti western, this is a good buy.

5277401,4,B0098TNDOE,Nice little blu ray set here including twenty five films for your viewing pleasure. Good quality lots of entertainment for you money.,1357948800,3,133,5.090909090909091
5277402,2,B0098TNDOE,If there inside it looks fine. Every scene in every movie thats outside looks terrible. It constantly de-rezzes and blurs. 2 of the movies are in complete Italian --no subtitles. Get it on dvd it will look better,1357862400,6,212,4.605263157894737
5277403,4,B0098TNDOE,"No this isn't the ultimate Blu Ray for spaghetti westerns and the audio does switch once in a while from english to Italian. The only thing Blu about these is the case. There is even a complete movie in Italian but I found all movies watchable and mostly obscure and the few exceptions were better copies than previous releases. Almost every spaghetti fan knows finding them in any watchable condition is the hardest part, All in all, if you want to see some spaghetti that you probably haven't seen before at a cheap price (you can find this set for less than 10.00)then this is well worth it.",1357430400,23,594,4.5092592592592595
5277404,1,B0098TNDOE,"This is poorer quality than found on any of Mill Creeks sets. One movie that I also have  on DVD was unwatchable on this ""Blu-ray"". Yea it's cheap for 25 movies, but i'm still trying to return it.",1355788800,10,196,4.157894736842105

  Now- beware that there is all kinds of artifacting on the few that I quickly looked at, because... all 25 flicks are crammed onto ONE Blu-ray disc. The menus are static screen-shots of all 25 films (including misspellings- ""REVEGNE""? ""FORST""? REALLY?); 5 to a page. And, for some reason, at least one (""LOLA COLT"") has an annoying right-corner ""bug"" from ""IRIS Mediaset"" and the movie flips back & forth between Italian & English dubbing- not the way to lead off a set. Also, all the titles seem to have the same US video burn titling over the original language titles...

  I watched ""LOLA COLT"" (see above) and ""DJANGO SHOOTS FIRST"" and ""FIRST"" is of a decent, clean & quite viewable quality. The others vary, but that's what you get in this kind of budget set...

  The nice thing is, if you are buying this collection for just having some of these films (a lot aren't included on the multiple PD sets out there); 50 cents per flick isn't a bad deal.",1354492800,74,2400,4.600478468899522
5277406,4,B0098TNDOE,"Especially now that the price is down to $8.50.

Yes, the quality of the movies is not up to Blu-Ray level or High Def.  These are basically good to acceptable DVD quality transfers of old movies, some of which are transferred from old video masters or high quality consumer VHS tapes.

But the idea of using the extra storage capacity in a BluRay to store additional movies on one disc, rather than one movie in much higher quality, cannot be underestimated for the convenience factor.

I have bought a large number of those 20 or 50 movie packs of old public domain movies from Mill Creek and other suppliers.  And having 25 movies accesible without having to get up, take the disc out of the sleeve (or maybe the disc even got misplaced from the plastic box) is a great form factor.  I would love Mill Creek to start doing this in the future.  I might even buy copies of the same old tired movies AGAIN as an upgrade for the convenience factor alone (are you listening, Mill Creek?)

I haven't even really commented on the quality of films themselves; writing, acting, etc.  Euro westerns are an acquired taste for some, and like any genre, quality can vary.  There are some dogs here mixed in with some well written, well shot films.  Acting is a little harder to gauge when the movie is dubbed from another language.

23 movies for 8 bucks is also a good bargain.  That used to be the price of one movie on a VHS.  No, not 25 movies, since two of them on this disk are in fact in Italian with no subtitles, so, for me, pretty well useless.

But overall, I love this disk and would purchase more like it if they were available.",1395446400,3,1631,4.39
5277407,2,B0098TNDOE,I am baffled why the manufacturer of this would want to cram 25 movies on one disc thus degrading the picture quality to VHS level. Why not do 3 volumes of 8 movies and get better quality. I am sure most Spaghetti Western fans would have been happy to buy 3 volumes and get something watchable. It's really too bad because there are some good and obscure titles on this that Would be fun to have if they were in watchable condition. Head scratcher..........,1384819200,5,457,4.4523809523809526
5277408,5,B0098TNDOE,"I picked up this collection solely for the inclusion of LOLA COLT FACE TO FACE WITH THE DEVIL starring Lola Falana but found it to be running over with titles that while obscure were no less entertaining, each in their own bloody and vengeful way. I found the playback quality to be well within the parameters of casual watchability and would recommend it to any fan of the pioneering Italian Western not expecting Criterion quality from a budget-priced disc. I am totally satisfied with this one and would not hesitate to invest in similar compilations from its source.",1379548800,,570,4.826530612244898

5277413,1,B0098TNDOE,"The poor image quality was already described by others, though calling it poor is almost an understatement.  VHS tapes have better quality!  Most films look like a poor youtube download.  What's worse even is that sections of some films are transferred in fast forward to save space on the disc.  The only thing this disc is good for is to get a sense of what films may be worth ordering from Amazon in Germany.",1362096000,5,411,4.513513513513513
5277414,5,B0098TNDOE,"I purchased this recently because it contains a lot of spaghetti films I didn't have, I now have viewed every film on this set and yes the video and audio quality fluctuates but overall it is not that bad for 25 films packed on a single disc and alot them don't look bad at all,most of these films are not available anywhere else and if your a true fan of these types of films come on this is a bargain,all I can say is im ready for some more these releases because I cant get enough of this genre,for those responsible for this release  thank you.",1359936000,6,548,4.169811320754717
5277415,4,B0098TNDOE,"So far, Amazon customer comments for this Blu-ray have been split down the middle. People either love or hate this disc. Personally I love having this Blu-ray in my collection... but I'll admit that some people won't. Your view on this Blu-ray will depend on your opinion of the spaghetti western DVDs put out by Mill Creek Entertainment and Echo Bridge Home Entertainment. If you have no problem with the quality of those movies on those companies' discs, then you won't have a problem with how the movies on ""Westerns Unchained"" appear. Sure, the movies don't look their absolute best, but think about it for a bit: You are getting TWENTY-FIVE movies for one low price! With the price I paid for this disc, that averages out to less than sixty cents a movie! I'm more than satisfied with this Blu-ray.",1359590400,5,803,4.702127659574468
