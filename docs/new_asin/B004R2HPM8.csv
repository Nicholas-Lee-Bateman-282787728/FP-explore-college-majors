8438678,3,B004R2HPM8,"Laila is a story of two con girls. They seduce the riches and blackmail them. It's episodic covering various spheres of Indian society. It involves a politician,doctor,professor,god man, film star,film producer etc. There is a detective who is after a mysterious girl named Laila. The trap laid by him is filled with twist and turns. It shows the naked truth in a naked way. Payal is hot and acts o.k. Laila is quite engaging. The story flows at fast pace with oodles of steamy stuff. It's kinda sexual satire. It's funny. The film drops due to bad actors,lousy background score and tacky action scenes. But Hey i enjoyed it. Coolest B grade stuff. Its a good watch for a lazy weekend. Don't miss it.",1304035200,,700,4.653225806451613
