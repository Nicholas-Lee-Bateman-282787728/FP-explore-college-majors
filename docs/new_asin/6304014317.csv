It begins with a rider being chased by five others. There is shooting. The lone man rides down a steep hill. He removes his saddle and hides in a ranch. The five search the ranch. The Sheriff questions the people there. The sought outlaw appears in the barn when offered coffee. Jim Smith drinks it and talks. He is offered a job as a cow hand. There is a $1,000 reward for the Oklahoma Cyclone. Smith is told to leave Carmelita alone. Smith sings and plays the guitar. Carmelita asks for a song. Then Carmelita sings. Jim has been meeting Carmelita secretly. Out on the range Jim plays a harmonica. Rawhide picks a fight with Jim and loses. There is a party for Carmelitas birthday. Jim does not attend in case he might be recognized by the guests.

Slim advises Jim about Rawhides actions; be careful. Slim will be leaving. Its time to change pastures. Jim talks about his past, he is overheard by Carmelita. The foreman orders the men on a job. Jim visits Carmelita to say goodbye. There is a place across the border. Five men enter and take over the place. They go upstairs to talk to a wounded lawman, then back down for a celebration. Jim goes back upstairs to talk to Henderson and explain his past! But he is caught by the Black Diablo. There is a fight. Slim helps Jim. Then there are shots! Slim is wounded and falls. The law arrives to capture the gang. And so it ends.

The movie seems to have been edited and other scenes removed. The ending seems shortened. It is an interesting story about an undercover operation but this is only revealed in the last minutes. This is an early Bob Steele movie, the later ones are better. This story of an undercover operation was repeated in other Western movies; its the obverse of the story or a respected citizen who is the secret head of an outlaw gang.",1510012800,,1840,4.454005934718101

As dubbed from a 16mm TV print, audio on this antique oater includes background noise that's similar to a slow rainfall. There's a serious unbalance here between music and action. Ideal moments for fisticuffs or shootouts are squandered by a talky script, especially during a saloon confrontation, while songs appear at every turn. Jim Henderson, aka the 'Cyclone' (Steele), performs a few, and when not spewin' 'baccy juice all over the floor, his new buddy Slim (St. John) renders an intentionally fey vocal on ""The Lavender Cowboy."" (Note: this is Al's first western of any length.)

Heavy Mexican accents make understanding Jimmy's girl, Carmelita (Rey) and her father the Don (Sarno) simply impossible. Don Pablo isn't aware that his ranch foreman, McKim (King) is also Black Diablo, leader of a bank robbing gang. In Jim's search for his missing father, Sheriff Henderson (Burns), he poses as the outlaw Cyclone and joins up with Diablo's outfit.

Slim and 'Cyclone' talk one late-night and become friends; the rest of Diablo's men hate the newcomer in their midst. After they pull another bank heist the gang heads to their over-the-border hideout, which is also where they're holding the imprisoned lawman. Jim blows his cover by reuniting with his dad, then has a fistfight showdown with Diablo. When it looks like his new pal will lose, Slim draws both pistols to keep the other gang members at bay, an act of loyalty that has tragic consequences.

Bob--who was rechristened Bob Steele at FBO--soon made a name for himself, and in the late 1920s, 1930s and 1940s starred in B-Westerns for almost every minor film studio, including Monogram, Supreme, Tiffany, Syndicate, Republic (including several films of the Three Mesquiteers series) and Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC) (including the initial films of their ""Billy the Kid"" series)

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, that ""new medium"" television had many hours to fill and few dollars to fill them --- They re-discovered the B-Western, still a popular mainstay of Saturday afternoon matinees and many cowboy stars thrilled a new audience --- Taking advantage of this rebirth in popularity, publishers brought to the marketplace comic books featuring these western heroes of ""Bob Steele"" Westerns --- These bimonthly issues were copyrighted in February and April of 1950 by Fawcet Publications --- His career which included nearly 200 feature films, serials and TV appearances --- Steele in his twilight years at the age 59 when he got the part of the cantankerous ""Trooper Duffy"", in the western comedy series ""F Troop"" (1965), who at the drop of a hat would give his rendition of fighting ""shoulder to shoulder with Davy Crockett at the Alamo"" --- Steele retired from the screen in 1973 --- Bob's long career, spanning more than 50 years came to an end in 1988 when he passed away.
