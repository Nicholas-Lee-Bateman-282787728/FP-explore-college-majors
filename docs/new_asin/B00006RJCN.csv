7972781,3,B00006RJCN,"The first time I heard about the Firesign Theatre was via a well worn LP borrowed from a military library back in 1968.  I thought they were the best comedy troupe around.  I thereafter bought several of their early albums, which I no longer have.  But I remember one routine that drove me crazy.  It involved an elevator and some very weird dialog (""Is there anyone on this elevator?"" ""No"". ""Well, what about you?"").  I had hoped that it might have been on this DVD.  The best part of the Firesign Theatre was the imagery that they conjured up while listening to those old albums.  Seeing them in action on this video of a live performance left me cold.  Watching them hop around the stage and change costumes was very distracting to the enjoyment of the material itself.  I am so much older now and do not find the same humor in their work as I did when I first heard them.  Perhaps we should just let sleeping dogs (and memories) lie.",1379548800,,937,4.395348837209302
7972782,5,B00006RJCN,The item was received on time and as described. It was packed for shipment in a careful and protective manner. I recommend this vendor.,1351036800,,135,4.666666666666667
7972783,1,B00006RJCN,"I would like to start by noting that I haven't grown up with ""The Firesign Theatre"". I don't have an entrenched emotional relationship with Firesign and now wonder whether a previous connection to the group was an important prerequisite to enjoying this DVD. I'd only read a few articles and reviews on Firesign and thought what the heck, give Firesign a go.  After all, I'm curious about comedy, improvisation and theatre, and as a H.S. Drama teacher, I'm always on the look out for good DVD performance resources.

However, I must apoligise to any dedicated ""Firesign"" fans (like Robin Williams) whom I may offend but I found ""Weirdly Cool"" surprisingly cumbersome and damp. There were a couple of sound moments that really worked well but on the whole, I was extremely disappointed by their worn routines and lame jokes. The stagecraft was only adequate. I actually found that watching ""weirdly cool"" became increasingly more torturous the further it went on.

Now,this DVD does provoke some thought on the nature of comedy and how much humour can be lost through cultural and/or generational gaps. How different are the British / Amercian / Australian / German / etc senses of humour?  I really doubt that I could even show one ot two moments from this DVD performance to my students as an example of playbuilding or comedy.

I guess weirdly cool is intended as a remembrance and must have some sentimental value to somebody who was there. However, as far as I'm concerned...

Anybody interested in a cheap almost new copy of ""Weirdly Cool"" for sale?",1191974400,3,1554,4.867424242424242
7972784,5,B00006RJCN,"Much of the Firesign Theatre's work requires close attention to understand it; it is simply not background comedy. The literary references alone are enough to keep most people scratching their heads and wondering what all the brouhaha is about.
That said, when I watched this video with friends, I was pleasantly surprised to see that even the people who had never heard of them were enjoying the performance a LOT. The reason, I think, is that the 4 or 5 are enjoying themselves so much here that it is quite infectuous. And the material is (as it often is) brilliant; and the ad libs bring it into the present and make it all fresh again.
If you are new to the Firesign Theatre, you could do worse than to start with this video. If you already know them, well, it's all here: brilliant, stupid, superficial and deep. Enjoy.",1042588800,14,825,4.581081081081081
7972785,5,B00006RJCN,"First, this one is not for everybody. If you want humor that requires your brain to be in neutral, then it's not for you. But, if you want humor that stretches your powers of thought, if you enjoy humor that has more than one banal level, or if you thought the Firesign Theatre died out in the 70's, then you're in for a real treat here. Originally produced for PBS as a pledge drive premium, it's a compilation of some of the best material that this group has ever produced, performed in such a way that laughter is automatic and uncontrollable. Stretch your mind, enjoy something that makes you think, order this one NOW!",1037232000,15,623,4.473684210526316
