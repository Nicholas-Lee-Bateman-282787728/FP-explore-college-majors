7090192,2,B00VHAG0NI,"Like Donnie Yen but what an awful movie...acting was bad, fight scenes were bad.  Wait until it goes down in price before you rent this one if you must.",1436745600,2,152,4.241379310344827
7090193,5,B00VHAG0NI,"This is one of finest Kung Fu / Martial Arts film I seen in a long while. The action, fight scenes, acting, story telling were top shelf. To further make this movie a class act was how they honored all those who make Martial Art movies. The many men and women who do the acting and fighting and others behind the camera. This is Donnie Yen's best film since he did IP Man one and two. Sometimes I would go back to catch up on the English subtitles because of the fast pace of the movie and staying up with the film. A fun movie for anyone who likes Kung Fu / Martial Arts action packed movies from the opening scene to the last. A well told and directed movie that even the whole family can watch.",1436659200,14,697,4.094890510948905
7090194,5,B00VHAG0NI,"An excellent movie from start to finish!  Great scene transition, viewer immersion qualities, outstanding audio and video, good English captioning for Cantonese language, lots of emotion and traditional movement. Very evident that nothing was spared in the budget including caliber of actors, directors, cinematographers, computer technicians, etc. It's true these days that movies have more than their fair share of computer-generated imagery and action shots but I was not disappointed by the work done here. I am a big fan of Hong Kong Cinema and Donnie Yen movies in particular and have been told by my friends that I'm often overly critical when it comes to this genre.  However, I was definitely pretty stoked by everything I saw during the course of the film.  I'll watch again in a few weeks to pick up what I may have missed, highly recommended!",1436313600,3,854,5.042553191489362

Donnie Yen plays Hahou Mo, who once ended up in a jail by accidentally killing his opponent in a fight. Three years later, while investigating the first murder in a series, Detective Luk Yuen-Sum has been contacted by the prisoner Mo who described her the killer and predicted the next victims...

This plot is tense and stunts are amazing. In fact each single fight was a pure well designed art. The final battle is an all-time best fight ever filmed.",1436227200,13,1872,11.22875816993464

7090198,4,B00VHAG0NI,"The story was interesting but the scenario was predictable (the woman cop kills the virile villain) but the overall movie with Donnie Yen is good and has push and pull between a man's aggression and women's non-aggression. For the heavy it plays out in one way, in Donnie Yen, it plays out in another and not all the aggressive players are men so there is a dichotomy. The pacing alright and the story shows how a very skilled and determined man can handle man lesser skilled policemen. Donnie Yen is over 50 now but plays into his strengths with very terse, in close fighting rather than high flying acts like he used to do in the 1990s. I recommend this as a modern martial arts movie, even with the predictable woman cop character that I knew was probably going to be the one finishing off the heavy early on.",1516579200,,812,4.456375838926174

7090202,4,B00VHAG0NI,"I saw this movie on a projected surface and of course it wasn't the best projector, but oh my!  Keeping up with subtitles was hard I found, given even the slow scenes seemed to forebode intense action.  Fans of weapons will appreciate this movie; no ""gun scenes"" or ""super weapons"" wherein the good guy plainly executes a room of guys with a hail of gunfire, or flying into the room with a flaming sword.  ..However much I do occasionally like that!  XD  That's so cheap, right?  The fighting is realistic-seeming, at least moreso than many of the mainstream Kung Fu films, and I always applaud that.  The bad guy seemed fairly worked into a police procedural with perhaps an ending that lacks satisfaction for some, but easily overlooked.  A great 2014 action movie!",1499126400,,767,4.714285714285714

He was a small skinny dude with a funny looking face. I couldn't take him seriously despite his decent performance. Kungfu Hustle main villain was a small, funny looking guy but he delivered. He had special skill and he can be scary when he wanted.

7090291,4,B00VHAG0NI,"Kung Fu Killer (also known as Kung Fu Jungle) marks the star Donnie Yens comeback to the traditional martial arts action film. Directed by Teddy Chen (Bodyguards and Assassins), the film is also homage to the long history of the Hong Kong action movies.

Donnie Yen plays Hahou Mo, a former police officer and martial arts now in jail for accidentally killing his opponent in a fight three years ago. When martial arts masters are found dead in the city, Hahou Mo knows that someone killed them in a combat and only he can prevent the murderer from killing another fighter.

The story is contrived, but the fast-paced film gives us enough thrills with bone-crunching action scenes that feature Donnie Yen and Baoqiang Wang who almost steals the film. It is also amusing to find many cameos including Raymond Chow, founder of Golden Harvest.

King Fu Killer may not be as intense as Donnie Yens hit Ip Man and its sequel, but is still very entertaining.",1445385600,,952,4.72289156626506

When a high profile murder occurs of a Kung Fu fighter, Hahou offers his services to capture the killer as he names the next victims. When one of those names becomes the next victim, Hahou is sprung and helps out.

The serial killer was done orderly. There were no real twists, although the film could of had one, it simply isn't in the nature of the Chinese film makers. The fighting was realistic as compared to the silly grunt style and anti-gravity style of other films. The film asks the question of martial arts being outdated for killing.

The only real question left unanswered was why does UPS model its uniforms from Chinese prisons suit?",1442880000,2,747,4.567164179104478

Following some major stinkers (looking at you, Iceman), Kung Fu Killer finally brings back some of the Don Don gravitas we know and love. That said, this movie is certainly not without its flaws and shortcomings. Despite being a central character, Yen really only has two big fights scenes, the latter of which is nearly ruined by some of the worst CGI I've seen in recent years. But only nearly; it's still easily the best fight in the movie. There's a fair amount of wire-fu in this movie, but it fits the storyline nicely. This is also some of Yen's best acting since Dragon.

7090386,5,B00VHAG0NI,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Dont let the corny title of KUNG FU KILLER fool you; it is actually a top notch martial arts action-thriller.  I admit the title almost dissuaded me from watching the film, however Im glad I didn't let it.  With a riveting storyline, massive levels of intensity, and some brutal fight scenes, this is one film Im definitely glad to add to my collection.  If you are a fan of high adrenaline action, this film is for you!

Donnie Yen just keeps getting better and better.  I am continuously impressed with his work.  If he can keep this type of momentum going, he will be a household name, much like Bruce Lee.

KUNG FU KILLER is shot well and looks great from a production standpoint.  But the story itself is what sells this film.  It pretty much grabs you from the start, and it never lets go.  I found myself enjoying it just as much as the action sequences.

The acting is very good, with the afore mentioned Donnie Yen headlining a great cast.  Yen delivers his drama just as powerfully as he doles out punches.  Joining Yen this time is Baoqiang Wang, who seems to quickly be making a name for himself in martial arts flick circles.  Wang does a great job portraying a cripple who has overcome his disability with deadly fighting skills.  I hope to see more of him in the future.

The fight scenes in KUNG FU KILLER are pure joy, and I have to admit they are some of the best I have seen this year.  They seem to be more brutally realistic than some, filled with cracking bones and smashed skulls.  I think this realism makes the intensity higher, which in turn makes for a more immersive film experience.

KUNG FU KILLER is a major win for me, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a thriller with some excellent action.  The film is available now in a variety of formats, so check it out.",1437609600,12,1872,4.368115942028986

I also loved the dedication at the end, honoring all of the action heroes of Hong Kong cinema, who had been making guest appearances throughout the whole film.  Really well done. Am going to watch it again just for the fight scenes.  Amazing how he gets older, but just keeps getting better-and still youthful looking!",1533427200,,374,4.828125

8710131,5,B00VHAG0NI,"Great movie, one of Donnie Yens best. It's got a mystery element to it, and unfortunately you can't figure it out bc the characters aren't really known in advance. It's all revealed little by little, as this Kung Fu Killer kills several different masters of Kung Fu. Yen helps the police with a little reluctance, and also aids to keep his love interest safe. The climax is good, the fight scenes are top notch, and Yen once again portrays a man who does what has to be done when a lesser man couldn't or wouldn't. This is why I love Donnie Yen on the big screen :) Everybody nails their part and it's a great cast.",1529107200,,615,4.310344827586207

8710137,5,B00VHAG0NI,"If you love genuine kung fu and like Donnie Yen, you'll probably love this instant classic. Not your typical cop thriller action movie.

Like others of Donnie Yen's movies, kung fu practitioners can actually watch the kung fu artistry and appreciate everything that is beautiful about the Chinese martial arts.",1519084800,,310,5.2
