1891707,4,B00009W35O,"This is a horribly shortened version of the original .
Having said that, the battle scene at the end is one of the best ever.
I wish they'd release the complete movie just as it was shown in 'road show' engagements.",1414195200,,215,4.2682926829268295
1891708,4,B00009W35O,"I enjoy action adventures....particularly the ones that came out in the late 1960's and early 1970's. This movie is FUN to watch. Sure, there is a formula here....you get the character studies of a group of ""n'er do wells"" thrown together in a French Forign Legion Regiment commanded by an American....Gene Hackman...and its FUN.
It doesn't hurt to having Catherine Denueve for good measure and a FINE performance
by versatle Max Von Sydow. The story is also atypical of this genre of film. The Legionaires are ordered to defend an archeological dig site which has enraged the locals....Why bother defending it? The drama and action are balanced with some good studies of the individual soldiers themselves. It is a Pleasure to watch.
What can you say about Gene Hackman? I truly enjoy watching Gene's Work. This film is no exception. What a treasure! If you enjoy Hackman films this is Very underated.
A nice addtion to any collection.

1891709,3,B00009W35O,"March or Die was one of a number of massive box-office disasters that nearly brought Columbia to its knees until CE3K rescued it from the brink. On the surface it belongs alongside the trilogy of mid-70s adventure films that Sean Connery made for the studio, with Gene Hackman's embittered Foreign Legionnaire reluctantly leading his surviving men to protect Max Von Sydow's archaeological dig. It's a perfectly workable premise for an adventure but it never really works. It's a schizophrenic film at best, and not just because of the usual international co-production vagaries: Gene Hackman is starring in a bleak, revisionist drama while Terence Hill is starring in an old-fashioned swashbuckler, and despite John Alcott's strikingly subdued photography neither strand quite works - not enough panache or too much depending on whose turn it is in the spotlight. The final (and only) battle scene is a particularly odd affair, with Hackman's character behaving very oddly indeed, depriving the audience of the expected climax in a way that seems more bizarre and just plain wrong than innovative. Heavy pre-release cutting probably didn't help (the original US TV broadcast, which many wrongly assume was given a theatrical release in Europe, included a number of deleted sequences, including an additional battle scene), but this is more an interesting failure than a successful reinvention of a subgenre it all but killed off for good. It certainly managed to kill of director Dick Richards' career.

The UK DVD is a decent fullframe transfer of the same theatrical version released both in the US and Europe with no loss of picture area: for the original 1.85:1 widescreen version you need to track down the Australian DVD. There are no extras on either issue: a shame, as it would have been interesting to see the deleted scenes, and the film's trailer was a very good example of wildly overhyping a film (it pitched it as an experience that would become one of the most important of your life!).",1157155200,8,2002,5.066666666666666

I was thinning out my old VHS collection and came across a very crappy copy that I recorded from TV (it was t even from cable back then).

1891755,4,B00009W35O,"For decades March or Die has lived in relative obscurity, a cinematic artifact lost to the sands of time, like one of the archeological treasures buried in the Moroccan desert which are featured in the movies plot. Neither a critical or commercial success upon its theatrical release in August 1977, the movie showed up on NBC in the summer of 1979 (with additional footage added and an ending different from the version which appeared in theaters) and then virtually vanished, rarely appearing, as far as I could tell, on late night TV or on cable movie networks such as AMC or TCM. Its few home video releases were barely above bootleg quality. Now, ITV Studios/Hens Tooth Video have released a restored DVD version of the original 1977 theatrical film, and fans of March or Die have an edition they can confidently add to their home video library.

To be sure, even fans of March or Die, such as myself, have to admit the movie is not a lost classic by any stretch of the imagination. But then not every movie has to be an all-time great  to be enjoyable or entertaining, which, I believe, March or Die is, especially for fans of action adventure movies set in exotic foreign locales in the romantic past. The plot features a company of Legionnaires ordered to protect an archeological expedition in the French Moroccan desert in the immediate aftermath of the First World War. The site in question is believed to hold the jewel-laden tomb of the Moroccan Joan of Arc but is deep in the heart of hostile Arab territory. One previous expedition has already been completely wiped out, and French government and cultural officials believe a second, successful expedition is a matter of national pride, not just a scholarly exercise, even if it means breaking a promise to the Arabs that there would be no further archeological digs in Morocco.

This is not a bad premise for an adventure movie, indeed, its a really good one. If March or Die had been made in the 30s, 40s, 50s, even the early 60s, it probably would have become a classic of the desert action genre. However, March or Die was made in the late 1970s, a time when it was virtually impossible to make a major mainstream motion picture that could be interpreted as endorsing Western colonialism in the Two-Thirds World or supporting militaristic beliefs. The filmmakers had to figure out a way to a French Foreign Legion movie that worked as a period adventure movie while also incorporating modern anti-war values, and one gets the impression that they never quite squared the circle. Critics at the time derided the movie for being static and featuring wooden performances, another way of looking at it would be to call the movie schizophrenic.

Gene Hackman (whom, I heard in a radio interview years late admit he took the role because it gave him a chance to go to Morocco) plays the commanding officer, Major Foster, an American who joined the  Legion after, it is hinted, he was forced to leave the U.S. Army in disgrace. At the start of the movie hes returning to Paris with the remnants of the Legion forces he led into the European trenches, and is unwilling to join in any Armistice celebrations (later in the movie there are hints he is suffering form what we would today call PTSD symptoms). When hes assigned to lead the archeological expedition, hes openly disdainful of the mission, but follows orders anyway, up to a point. Hes both protective of his men, yet also adheres to the rugged Legion codes of training new recruits to the breaking point  or letting them die where they drop.

Terrence Hill, perhaps best known for his role in spaghetti Westerns, plays Marco, a Gypsy jewel thieve and cat burglary who enlists in the Legion in order to avoid a prison sentence. He retains his romantic, rebellious, free-spirited nature, leading him into an ongoing battle of wills with Major Foster, yet who also comes to adopt himself the demands of a Legionnaire. Catherine Deneuve plays a depressive war widow both Major Foster and Marco become attracted to, although (or maybe because) she has quiet contempt for such values as duty, honor, and patriotism, pillars of the Legionnaire way of life. Ian Holm as the Arab leader El Krim and Max von Sydow as a stuffy Louvre official who accompanies the expedition round out the main characters.

Movies like The Dirty Dozen showed it was possible to integrate anti-war, anti-authority values into a genre picture, but it takes a commitment to the story and the genre  that March or Die seems, at times, to lack. As it stands, at 107 minutes (this DVD has the same running time as the running time listed in the original 1977 New York Times review) the movie never drags, but it does seem choppy at times, with scenes seeming to end abruptly and hints footage was edited out here and there, perhaps by a nervous studio after poorly-received advanced audience screenings. Unfortunately, this DVD version contains no deleted scenes or extended footage (such as the footage which appeared in the 1979 NBC telecast). For those wishing to know more about the story, the characters, their histories, and relationships to each other and how that impacts their actions, I recommend seeking out the 1977 paperback novelization of the movie.

Still, for all its shortcomings, I still find March or Die to be an entertaining popcorn movie, if not on the level of Beau Geiste or Lawrence of Arabia. The filmmakers do make great use of the Moroccan locales and in the final third of the movie, set in the desert, the film really gets into action movie gear. The climatic battle between the greatly outnumbered (but not outgunned) Legionnaires and the desert tribes, now united under El Krim, is truly spectacular, and demonstrates the great  movie March or Die might had been, if the filmmakers had more firmly embraced the films B-movie roots.

In terms of technical quality this DVD version is fine, the studio did a great job restoring the sound and picture quality. The cinematography, whether set in an oppressive and smoky Paris train station or in the wide-open Moroccan desert under a blazing sun, is one of the movies strengths, as is the sweeping-yet-intimate Maurice Jarre score, both of which are well-served by todays home theater equipment. If this DVD package falls short, it is in the features department. There are none. While, honestly, I often skip DVD features, this is one movie where lost footage or several interviews and commentaries from the cast and crew would have been appreciated. Im most disappointed by the lack of the films original theatrical trailer. I still  remember seeing it the night my parents took me to see Star Wars, and, to be honest, the trailer made more of an impression on me at the time than George Lucass hip space opera.

Im charitably giving this DVD release of March or Die four stars, because I found the movie as still entertaining as I remembered it after viewing the NBC telecast so long ago. Im recommending it for fans of French Foreign Legion films in particular and fans of action adventure films form the 1960s and 70s in general, the kind of movies that are celebrated in magazines like Cinema Retro and are referenced by contemporary filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino.",1427414400,27,7238,4.798555377207062
