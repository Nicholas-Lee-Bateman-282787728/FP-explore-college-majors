8249147,5,B00134D11C,"This DVD shows Ren Creemers and Wim de Vries, both drummer and Dutchmen as ""The Drumbassadors"". Stylistically they combine European, African, and American grooves, sounds, and melodies in their own unique way. An essential requirement of their repertoire that it must consist of 'songs'. Melody, no matter how simple, is key.

Besides using different kinds of sticks Ren and Wim use their fingers, sing and rap words with only one goal in mind: to feature the drum kit as a musical instrument with unlimited possibilities. That's why this Drumbassadors DVD sounds like a global jouney rather than a drum show-off. Their musical, creative and virtuoso approach to the drumset is clearly perceptible on this DVD, therefore Volume 1 is a must for all music lovers.
