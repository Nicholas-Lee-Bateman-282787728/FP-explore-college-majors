6068800,5,B00GAXASLC,This set was a great addition to my collection. They are great to watch over and over again. You have wit and mystery and that's a good combination for a night at the movies. Of course you have to have Popcorn and that's a given.,1311292800,4,229,4.111111111111111
6068801,5,B00GAXASLC,"Finally, the Agatha Christie Hour is being put on DVD for us to watch.  It's a really great series, such fun.  This particular DVD is PAL, European, so you have to make sure your TV is compatible.  Or you can watch it on your computer, which is okay, but they are all being converted to U.S> versions, and there are two separate series out already on U.S. versions, so try those first unless you have PAL conversion.

6068804,4,B00GAXASLC,"Good collection of Christie mysteries. Particularly enjoyed the Mr. Parker Pyne episodes for their humor and thought provoking situations.
They range from quiet and proper investigations into what life is all about to fast-paced and criminal investigations.
Character driven and well produced vehicles for the up and coming and established actors of the time.

6068826,2,B00GAXASLC,"When you see Agatha Christie as the author of anything, you think of a wonderful story with surprises along he way.  Not so here.  I have only watched the first two of the first disc, but have already shelved it.  These are not like anything else I have seen attributed to her work.  I don't know if these were a collection of works when she first started writing or something someone else put together after her death.  Either way, I just could not get into them.  The price was alright, but buy something else like Miss Marple or the man--""Hercule"" to transform you to another place and time for suspense and fantastic entertainment.

6068838,5,B00GAXASLC,"We have seen all the Poirot, Marple, and most of the movies. We love Christie. So we went ahead an purchased this set because we needed more Christie. We enjoyed these shows a lot. it's not typical of a lot of Christie TV stuff. It's quirkier, more out of generic form. These are the lesser known stories, lesser known leads. The production value is very 70's/80's BBC TV quality, but if you're a Christie fan you'll probably love this kitsch aspect. Somehow it adds to the older Christie television experience. It relies on story and character and actors, rather than production tricks. There are a few in here that I certainly like a lot, but all are watchable. The set is certainly rewatchable. If you're like us and have seen all the other stuff, you can go ahead and get this set confidently. There are a few gems in here. We enjoyed it.",1402272000,8,842,4.509803921568627
6068839,5,B00GAXASLC,"Some people don't have a lot of use for short stories, but when it's Christie, that changes everything.  I was very interested when looking over a profile of an actor, to find a mention that he had appeared in one of these.  It was the first I had heard of the series.  Thus, a rush to search lists to find it.  These are largely sound stage productions, again, not a downer to an avid fan. For me, I not only appreciate but welcome adaptations of some of her lesser known and more atypical stories.

One of the extras on a disc mentions pre-Poirot elements found in the Parker Pyne stories (of which two are included). I have the stories in print and had not registered the ""Miss Lemon"" introduction -- you know, Poirot's future super efficient secretary. Another interesting element is that Adriane Oliver makes her debut in the Pyne stories, the same later appearing in some of Poirot's books.

Overall, these are interesting stories and well made adaptations with quality casting.",1402185600,6,984,4.691860465116279

6068857,3,B00GAXASLC,"The info that these discs were not Region 1 was hidden in the ""editorial review""--I can't play them on my dvd player",1391299200,,116,4.318181818181818
6068858,5,B00GAXASLC,"Agatha Christie has done more for British Mystery than any other writer. It's not Poirot, but some of the Poirot characters first appeared in these stories. Mysteries  take place in the 1920-30s period, and provide a look at a bit more of Christie than perhaps Poirot displays. There is more to Agatha Christie than just mystery.

The true question for this series is not Will Christie's stories be good?; but Will the acting be up to script level? Are the actor's worthy? They are. The series is cast with several British members of high achievement and fame. 10 episodes give interesting mix from romance to crime. They come alive, enchanting at times, suspenseful at other times.
SUBTITLES for all episodes, and it's a great set.

Complete episode details:
""Case of the Middle-Aged Wife"": London's Parker Pyne (Maurice Denham), 'Dr. of Happiness' is engaged by a cheated-upon wife. Does it help, Mr. Pyne, to reverse the cheating participants? What's good for the George is good for the Maria. Claude is played by Rupert Frazer(The House of Eliott)

""In a Glass Darkly"": A murder 'vision' is seen by a party guest causing him to suggest to the fianc that she not go through with her wedding. After serving in WWI, he returns & the prophecy takes on new meaning.

""Girl in the Train"": International intrigue involving a broker, a blonde, and an encounter on the train to Portsmouth--England not Massachusetts. Mystery, comedy, romance, and adventure; Agatha Christie style.

""Fourth Man"": Riding the train together from London to Scotland was a doctor, a lawyer, and a clergyman. Sounds like a joke--but not when the 4th man joins the train compartment. John Nettles (Midsomer Murders), very young, is the 4th man. Fiona Mathieson also gives a great performance.

""Case of the Discontented Soldier"": Parker Pyne gets another client in this series. An ex-soldier misses the excitement and danger of the military. His life in an English village is a bit droll--but oh so beautiful. Great place to visit. Wm. Gaunt plays the Major.

""Magnolia Blossom"": Marriage trapped Theo (Claraia Madden-Sense and Sensibility)is the lady caught in the middle of 2 men who desire her in this 1920's love triangle. Husband Jeremy (Richard Darrell) vs lover Vincent (Ralph Bates-Poldark). Should Theo choose freedom or loyalty? Romance or duty?

""The Mystery of the Blue Jar"": Great! Law student, Jack (Robin Kermode-Wilde) hears a woman yell 'murder,help murder' on the fairway. Great golf scenes with vintage togs, clubs. Then lovely French Felise (Isabelle Spade-Rue des Plaisirs & other hot Fr. films) hears and dreams of the blue vase. She, Jack, and ""Doctor of the Soul"" (Michael Aldridge-Love for Lydia), psychic, set about finding the answer to the mysterious voice. Fun Christie Mystery style end.

""The Red Signal"": Another psychological mystery & murder. Uncle/doctor (Alan Badel-The Woman in White; this performance aired after his real death) is shot after a seance foretelling death-'red signal.' Nephew & heir, Dermot (Richard Morant-Dorothy L. Sayers Mystery;Day Night Day Night) and lover Claire (Joanna David-Lillie;Pride and Prejudice;Bleak House)look guilty...but how? who? Jack Trent, Claire's spouse, Jack's friend, is played by Christopher Cazenove (Dutchess of Duke Street) and the psychic is Rosalie Crutchley.

""Jane in Search of a Job"": Jane (Elizabeth Garvie-Pride and Prejudice) look-alike to Grand Duchess of Ostravia (Amanda Redman-Little Dorrit) impersonates at risk to her life for $$. Cop Nigel (Andrew Bicknell-New Adventures of Robin Hood) fears danger. Ambush? Kidnap? Death? Conspiracy? Princess Anna (Stephanie Cole-Doc Martin).

""The Manhood of Edward Robinson"": Fiancee to Maud (Ann Thornton-Hope and Glory), a geek and meek Edward (Nicholas Farrell-Chariots of Fire) buys sleek car and heads on a Christmas adventure, starting with gorgeous diamond burglar Noreen (Cherie Lunghi-Secret Diary of a Call Girl). A life-changing encounter & romance. Maud's mom is Margery Mason (Love Actually). Also Rupert Everett (My Best Friend's Wedding.)

As you see, exceptional casts, the world's best books adapted well, beautiful period settings, and mystery mixed with crime and romance.",1387497600,100,4201,5.346969696969697
6068859,5,B00GAXASLC,"Very good product,no one like Agatha Christie,she is the best,fast service and good price,a must have for all mystery buffs",1386633600,,123,5.2
6068860,3,B00GAXASLC,"Dame Agatha Christie wrote several wonderful mystery gems in the 1920's and 1930's before concentrating far more on literary detectives Hercule Poirot and Ms. Marple.  It wasn't until approximately thirty years ago that British television produced ten fifty-minute, video-taped adaptations from Christie's extensive collection of suspense tales.  Watching them is something of an unique experience, as they are produced far more like live stage plays than filmed television episodes.

We will rate each one separately from one to five stars (five stars as best, etc.)

1. ""The Case of the Middle-Aged Housewife""  (a Parker Pyne story)  **** 1/2

2. ""In a Glass Darkly"" (war-flavored melodrama)  ***

3. ""Girl on the Train"" (thoroughly amusing!)  **** 1/2

4. ""The Case of the Discontented Soldier""  (a second Parker Pyne story) **** 1/2

5. ""The Fourth Man""  (not entertaining and rather disturbing)  * 1/2

6. ""Magnolia Blossom"" (unappealing, melodramatic love triangle)  **

7. ""The Red Signal"" (classic seance-leads-to-murder mystery)  ****

8. ""Mystery of the Blue Jar""  (the original story is much more intriguing with fewer details)  ** 1/2

9.  ""Jane in Search of a Job""  (OK viewing, but a more appealing lead actress would have done justice to the humorous concept)  ***

10. ""The Manhood of Edward Robinson""  (starts off slow but becomes increasingly appealing)  **** 1/2

While none of the ten stories are five-star gems, half of them are fairly close and well worth viewing at least once.  Part of the difficulty watching ""The Agatha Christie Hour"" is separating what (or, more specifically, who) one visualizes in reading the short stories vs. the actors appearing in these extended, often very dry adaptations.  Case in point: Maurice Denham, the elderly actor portraying Parker Pyne here, is competent, but his portrayal of Pyne lacks the amused, gleam-in-the-eye charisma necessary for entertaining viewers.  Sometimes, these productions are pretty much spot on (i.e. ""Girl on the Train""), but then there is ""The Fourth Man,"" which is simply dreadful (the problem isn't the actors, it is the storyline's unappealing flashbacks).

Overall Rating: 7.5/10 (There is more than enough here to give this DVD set a chance, but one should rent it, if possible, first).",1360886400,40,2276,5.300561797752809
6068861,4,B00GAXASLC,"Like the earlier series ""Wodehouse Playhouse"" -- which focused on lesser known stories of P. G. Wodehouse (i.e., no Bertie Wooster or Blandings Castle) -- the ""Agatha Christie Hour"" steered clear of Poirot, Marple, and Tommy & Tuppence.

The stories are hit and miss.  A few are not mystery or adventure stories at all.  ""The Mystery of the Blue Jar"" (about a man who hears cries for help on a golf course that no one else hears) and ""The Red Signal"" (which is treated like an old-fashioned movie mystery and has a phenomenal cast) are the closest to being typical Christiesque mysteries.

Many of the others are fun adventure stories.  ""Jane in Search of a Job"" and ""The Case of the Discontented Soldier"" and ""The Girl on the Train"" are all tongue-in-cheek adventures that do not stint on the chase or on the fun.  Some of the rest, like ""The Fourth Man,"" are not very interesting.

Though this was made around the same time as ""Brideshead Revisited"" this show looks like most British tv at the time.  Many of the scenes were done in one take, and on videotape, with filmed exteriors.  This makes some of it look cheap and chintzy.",1341273600,28,1132,4.592039800995025
