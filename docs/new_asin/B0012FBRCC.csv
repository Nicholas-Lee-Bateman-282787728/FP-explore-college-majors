8245799,5,B0012FBRCC,"This is not a perfect film, and it's not full of special effects or big hollywood stars .. but it is a great idea, a great scrip, well executed and on a super low budget its definately impressive.  it was shot in Dallas, Texas in Deep Ellum.  I have personally worked with the director.  His shirts and production company logo and motto is  GO BIG OR GO HOME!",1357516800,,359,4.235294117647059
8245800,5,B0012FBRCC,"""The Long Shot"" is a remarkable achievement.  It stands with Alexander Sokurov's ""Russian Ark"" as cinema's only other full-length production filmed entirely with one shot - no editing.

The clever premise of ""The Long Shot"" is an evening inside a tavern filled with barflies and bawdy humor that becomes a stage for acting out the comedy and drama of relationship turmoils.  The alcohol-fueled philosophies and conflicts among patrons are entertaining and oftentimes insightful.  It's definitely worth spending 89 minutes on a barstool watching the fun.",1231891200,,553,5.470588235294118
