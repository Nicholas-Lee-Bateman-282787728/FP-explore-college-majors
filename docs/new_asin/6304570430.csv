7876290,5,6304570430,"Super Bowl III remains, for many New Yorkers, the pinnacle of sports events. I can well remember seeing the game at the Black Orchid Bar, on Shrewsbury Street in Worcester, MA. The patrons, it seemed, were Holy Cross students or Mafiosi. This tape will take the viewer back to that wondrous 1969 Sunday afternoon in Miami when the underdog New York Jets upset the highly favored Baltimore Colts.  If there was ever an ""establishment"" in sports, it was represented by the hideously ""big business"" NFL Commissioner, Pete Rozelle.  And if there was ever an ""underdog,"" it was ANY AFL team going to the Super Bowl. A trivia question: Wasn't this the first time the phrase  ""Super Bowl"" was used? Viewers will immediately appreciate not the Jets vaunted passing attack, but their solid running game. The big backs Matt Snell, Bill Mathis and Emerson Boozer run LEFT, not the traditional power sweep to the right. . Did the Jets have secret intelligence about Colt cornerback Lenny Lyles tonsillectomy? What about defensive end Ordell Brasse's bad leg? Is that why the Jets concentrated their attack to the left?  We Jets fans are reminded how the finger of fate was on our side that afternoon. 5 times in the first, the Colts drove into the Jets ""red zone"" and came away with NOTHING due to 2 missed FGs and 3 deep interceptions; by Randy Beverly, Jim Hudson and Johnny Sample. I always thought the Colts threw in the towel at halftime. Super Bowl III features the biggest 7-0 halftime lead of all time. Everyone I knew thought the Jets had the game at that point. There is crisp commentary on the key plays by Curt Gowdy, the '60s voice of the AFL.  We hear form Joe Namath, Johnny Sample and Coach Ewbank of the Jets. Coach Shula and RB Tom Matte share the Colts viewpoint. The colors are sharp and clear in this first class 73-minute production. By the 4th quarter, we see the sweat and grass-stained uniforms! Buy the tape and relive that epic winter afternoon. This is pro football from the old pre-free agent days. This is pro football from when there were 2 distinct leagues. This is pro football with no soccer style place kickers. This is pro football from when the grass was green. 5 stars all around!",998092800,2,2206,4.660668380462725
7876291,5,6304570430,"Super Bowl III. The BaLtimore colts versus the NY Jets. The NFL vs. the AFL. Broadway Joe vs. Johnny U.{though an aging Unitas was injured}.White shoesVs. High tops. The 17-21 point favorite colts, having waxed the cleveland browns in the NFL champoinship game, were lookingfoward to squashing the Jets. This tape brings that game and time together very well. Namath,being young arrogant{and probably having a few in him at the time} guaranteed victory before hand. He almost got into a fist fight with Lou michales, the colts place kicker a couple of days before the game. Everyone,every sportswriter of the time predicted a colts victory{except for Dave Anderson of the NY TIMES}.What happened was the greatest single game upset of a team sport in professioanl sports . Namath, playing disciplined , ate up the colts and the clock. Weeb Ewbank, the underrated head coach of the Jets{who had coached the colts to victory in 1958, th other most significant game in football history}badly outcoached a young Don Shula,who, in viewing theis video seems INCREDULOUS that this was happening. 30 years later, many of the colts still cant belive that this happened. Watch this tape. It expains it very well. Namath became an icon of the young after this game, and probably certified his place in the hall of fame with this win. Sweetvengance for ewbank, a sour day for Shula, the colts and the old AFL. Good fun, a great tape,evoking wonderful memories of a time when, for a little while, NY was FUN CITY and Braodway Joe owned the town.",985219200,,1531,4.869731800766283
7876292,4,6304570430,"Number III was the one that truly made the Super Bowl the biggest game in American pro sports, thanks to the media coverage following Joe Namath's  'Guarantee' of an underdog Jets victory. It also proved that the youthful  American Football League could contend with the veteran NFL on the playing  field.
But the other team, the Baltimore Colts, had plenty of  opportunities to take the game far away from their opponents. There's Tom  Matte's then-record-setting 58-yard run that set up... an interception.  There's a couple plays where Colts QB Earl Morrall didn't see a wide-open  receiver to throw a scoring toss to, one of those missed opportunities  ending in an interception. There were also the two missed Colts field-goal  attempts. Baltimore basically lost on offensive miscues and mistakes, and  the Jets took advantage of them at every opportunity. Baltimore wouldn't  even score for nearly fifty-six minutes of regulation time. And the Jets,  surprisingly, used a conservative ball-control offense to wear the Colts  defense down.
Even thirty years later, Super Bowl III is, quite possibly,  the biggest upset in American pro sports history.
