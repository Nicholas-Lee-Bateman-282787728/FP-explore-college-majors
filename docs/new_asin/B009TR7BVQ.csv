8544250,1,B009TR7BVQ,"I had seen this movie as a child after seeing the original Fly movies.  I didn't remember much about it, except that I knew it was bad.  Fast forward many, many years later, and I took a shot at the .099 version that was on Prime Video.  It was not worth the .099.  It was absolutely horrible, and the parts that I remember being bad as a kid, were worse seeing it as an adult.  The video quality is poor, the only tie-ins to the first two Fly movies are the names, who are now relatives of the original characters.  The makeup, the video quality, the acting all add up to a terrible waste of time.  This is worse than a B-movie.  Just for further info, I actually ordered the DVD at first to complete the collection, but the DVD was in PAL format ans wasn't stated in the description so the vendor took it back without issue.  I believe the price was around $11.00 or so, but the .99 cent rental off Prime wasn't even worth it so it all worked out in the end.  This movie isn't even in the ""I'm curious to see it"" category when there is absolutely nothing else to do.  Watcher beware.",1528848000,,1085,4.168269230769231
