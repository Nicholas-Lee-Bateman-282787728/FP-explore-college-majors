2897815,4,B000TGKXKM,"I saw this on the Create PBS Channel, but I missed about 2/3 of the episodes.  Hungry for more, I purchased this and loved it.  I ran it through an up-convert DVD to my big 61"" Sony HDTV and it blew me away.  Trouble is, I want even more episodes.  i would like to see them carry on with this concept in other locations with other composers.  Good, educational narrative by the hosts, OK choices of the music selections and spectacular scenery.",1224806400,7,444,4.365853658536586
2897816,5,B000TGKXKM,"I recommend this DVD to all classical music lovers, and armchair travelers as well.
My only regret is having visited some of the cities/countries featured here, and not having watched this DVD before! The photography, commentary, and music selection are wonderful!
I hope they'll soon put out Vol. 2, etc.
Thanks.",1221868800,4,313,5.1568627450980395
2897817,5,B000TGKXKM,I watched this show by accident on PBS. I tried to tape a few of the episodes but couldn't wait and just bought it instead.,1218240000,2,123,3.96
2897818,4,B000TGKXKM,"This wonderful collection of music and beauty is truly amazing. The music of course speaks for itself, and the locations are truly the most beautiful places on earth, as the absolutely superb narrator Simon Callow tells us at the beginning of each episode. The helicopter pilot and his cameraman should be given the very highest awards possible.

The problem is with the two dreadful Australians that keep popping in and out of each ""destination"". Their ugliness, truly awful dress sense, and dreadful accents really lower the tone of every single scene they appear in. Why couldn't the producers have just let Simon Callow take care of things?

If however, someone out there is thinking about making a documentary about the music of the Outback, then Niki Vasilakis and Matt Willis might be just the people you are looking for.",1203206400,12,828,4.9496402877697845
2897819,5,B000TGKXKM,"Being a music teacher, and having travel numerious times in Europe, I was fascinated by these DVDs.  The presentation and photography was excellent, and the history and background of the various composers was engaging and compelling.  I have used these as teaching aides in both my middle school and high school music classes with good results.  Highly recommended!",1197590400,29,365,5.258620689655173
2897820,5,B000TGKXKM,We saw one episode late one night on our PBS HD channel and loved it.  The DVD set is marvelous and we'll enjoy it for years.  The sound and picture quality are magnificent.,1196294400,24,173,4.212121212121212
2897821,5,B000TGKXKM,"I have been waiting several months for this DVD to become available and was ready to pay several times the Amazon price (get it, it's a steal).  It is a wonderful journey of sound and sight.  If you love classical music you will absolutely adore this DVD.  Guaranteed.",1190592000,14,268,4.541666666666667
2897822,5,B000TGKXKM,"A friend told me about this DVD set. It is an outstanding history of the major composers set in their European cities with an accomplished violinist playing their music. As a classical pianist, I feel it is a must have for any who appreciate the composers of that era.",1189123200,28,268,4.489795918367347
2897833,1,B000TGKXKM,"I was totally wowed by the original PBS broadcasts. The photography and sound were just stunning, not to mention the program content and excellent narration by Simon Callow. I missed a few episodes however and, as I didn't want the program to be permeated by ads as well, I thought I would check out the DVD. Ok, I knew I wasn't going to get the quality of the original broadcast on a 'normal' DVD (as opposed to BluRay) but I was expecting something a LOT better than this.
Disappointment is putting it mildly. The picture almost looks like something transferred from a VHS recording with fuzzy imaging and 'lines' around the fine detail. You can even see some graininess and pixellation of sloping edges (480 res.) which makes me wonder if I have an inferior copy, or if it is the transfer from the Australian format (region 4) that is to blame. Either way, it is nowhere near as good as it could or should have been, given that this is not a BluRay recording. I have seen much better picture quality on normal DVDs. And the sound, unless you use Dolby 5.1, is also poor, lacking stereo spread and detail. I have three machines, one of which is BluRay and it was poor on all three, so I know it's not the fault of the machines. Nor my TV as, like I said, the ORIGINAL'S picture quality and sound was incredible.
I hope they DO release a BluRay of this wonderful series soon as the breathtaking photography certainly deserves it. I got the feeling I could actually BE there watching the TV broadcast in HD it was so good. I feel cheated having purchased this grossly INFERIOR transfer and would strongly urge all you potential buyers to WAIT until the BluRay versions appears, whereupon you too will be blown away with the magnificence of the sights and sounds contained therein!",1404432000,2,1780,4.548286604361371
2897834,5,B000TGKXKM,"When I miss European travel, I play this, and then I don't feel so bad.  Callow's commentary and the scenery as well as Australian violinist is not to be missed.",1386633600,,161,4.366666666666666
2897835,5,B000TGKXKM,I travel a lot and saw a portion of this video. The photography is beautiful and watching it brings back wonderful memories.,1384387200,,124,4.681818181818182
2897836,5,B000TGKXKM,"beautiful to the eyes and ears. Interesting and well researched. I'm enjoying it and using it with my students. They are enjoying it too. Far from a dry boring biography of a composer. You visit the city, see the sights, and get to know the composer and his music. A good buy.",1318723200,,276,4.326923076923077
2897837,4,B000TGKXKM,"For those of you who love classical music and travel this series should be required viewing. Host Simon Callow and his team take us on a whirlwind tour of the great cities of Europe where great composers such as J.S. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Tchaikovsky and Vivaldi lived and worked. Classical Destinations is beautifully filmed and, although each episode is less than 30 minutes, includes an impressive amount of information on each locale while keeping the focus on the lives of the composers. I have a good knowledge of classical music and felt that I still learned something new. More than that, I want to visit each and every one of these glorious destinations for myself!

As much as I enjoyed this program, there are a few minor reasons why I did not give it five stars. First of all, it would be even more informative if the music playing in the background were identified. And as much as I enjoyed the theme, it did become something of a mind worm after a while, and I would prefer hearing more music by the composers themselves.

Having traveled to Leipzig last year, I was also surprised that the Classical Destinations crew did not film the stunning pink and green interior of the St. Nicholas Church, or include the famous Magnus portrait of Mendelssohn that hangs in the composer's home. But this is just me being picky.

All nitpicking aside, this is a wonderful program worth every dollar. I eagerly look forward to seeing Classical Destinations II!",1312502400,12,1465,4.75984251968504
2897838,5,B000TGKXKM,"Folks looking to learn a little European history with a strong emphasis on the composer's lives while enjoying their wonderful classical music will be happy with this video.  It is interesting to learn what inspired the great composers to create their music.  Many of them socialized together (and sometimes competed with each other).  The video brings their lives into perspective and one will learn that the great composers were just ordinary people trying to make a living doing what they knew best.  Anyone who has traveled in Europe will be familiar with many of the locations and enjoy it as a bit of a travelog.  The theme song created for the video is quite nice, but one gets a bit tired of hearing it multiple times in every episode.  I am hoping Part 2 of this series becomes available in the United States sometime soon.  Simon Callow is very knowledgeable, articulate, witty and worth the price of admission.",1270512000,5,921,4.791139240506329
2897839,5,B000TGKXKM,"The DVDs are very relaxing to watch and help unwind after a long day at work.  The European scenery and classical music are beautiful! Combined with the information about the different composer's, it is a great way to learn about classical music.",1260835200,2,246,4.857142857142857
2897840,5,B000TGKXKM,"My Tivo just happened to record this program one day on it's own and I decided to watch it, not expecting much.  I expected it to be another one of those dry documentaries that I'd watch about 2 minutes of and then delete off my Tivo. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the narration, the interesting storyline, and most notably, the spectacular photography. The camera work is gorgeous and was one of the main reasons I got hooked on watching this series. I was also very impressed at how musically talented Niki Vasilakis was, especially for someone so young. I hope they decide to eventually extend this series and produce more episodes in the future.",1239580800,4,673,4.703389830508475
2897841,4,B000TGKXKM,"This is helping me to plan a musical tour of Europe. Wonderful to see the landscapes, landmarks, buildings, gardens, etc. alongside the music.  My husband gets irked because they don't always play the pieces they are discussing, but I'm perfectly happy with the presentation. A very pleasant, relaxing viewing experience - and I'd say you are likely to learn something.",1231372800,3,369,5.15
2897842,5,B000TGKXKM,"The pictures of those old, beautiful buildings are unbelieveable. We don't see that kind of workmanship today. Just imagine these buildings were done with very primitive tools and material and, yet they withstood all these years. Today every thing is done in a hurry and at a great cost for something that won't last. This DVD is an absolute must have.  I can't praise it enough.",1226361600,4,379,4.742424242424242

8209029,5,B000TGKXKM,"As I fully enjoyed watching this series on TV, I was delighted when I found it on DVD.

The wonderful locales and photography significantly enhance the wonderful music.",1485734400,,277,4.872340425531915

8209034,4,B000TGKXKM,Good photography. Wish there was more music included with the stories of the composers. However it just motivates you to listen to more of the classical works. This is my second copy of the broadcast. The first was never returned to me. I wish it was released in Blue-ray.,1424649600,,272,4.571428571428571
8209035,5,B000TGKXKM,"Any lover of classical music will surely appreciate this DVD that covers the biography of classical composers and the places they live. Simon Callow covers the personal lives of classical composers and takes you to the various locations where they lived and worked. There is also a season 2 of this series, but I could not find it available in the NTSC video format. The season 2 DVD is available in the PAL and area 2 European video formats from Australia and Great Britain.",1413158400,,475,4.666666666666667
