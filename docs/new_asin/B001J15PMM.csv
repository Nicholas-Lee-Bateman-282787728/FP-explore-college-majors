 It is an excellent piece of didactics film making with a warm flavor of cultural pride; an elevating spirit of celebration, and a fine sense to tackle critical issues in the struggle for survival and agency of African people in the Diaspora.
 The sensible mixture of Maya Angelou's poetry and narration, with pieces of interviews, statements and academic snapshots by distinguished African American intellectuals and activists; the blend of archival materials and lively reports of several community organizations underlined by an outstanding musical sound track, all reflect the serious and committed research conducted by M.K. Asante, Jr. not only in America but also in Africa, Europe, and the Caribbean.
 The music by Nnenna Freelon and Derrick Hodge and the script written by M.K. Asante, Jr. himself are also excellent and inspiring. The Black Candle is a document of celebration of African people and should be viewed by everyone committed to truth, history, and memory. The Black Candle should also have a place in every African home and in any institution concerned with cultural understanding as an extremely important piece of scholarship towards African resurgence.

No longer is this the case.  The Black Candle, a marvelous movie about Kwanzaa, narrated by Dr. Maya Angelou, directed by M.K. Asante, Jr., and produced by Ben Haaz tastefully celebrates Kwanzaa! This powerful film is supported by the moving insights of engaging voices like poet icon Amiri Baracka and hip hop's own Chuck D; seasoned by the musical scores of jazz musicians like Derrick Hodge and carried upwards by the vocal wonders of  jazz vocalist Nnena Freelon.

I really got a greater understanding of how Kwanzaa came to be and the civil rights pathos that
it grew from by viewing this piece.",1358208000,,209,4.526315789473684
8311699,5,B001J15PMM,"The sounds of drums called the community to the Rich Theater of The Woodruff Arts center in Atlanta; they were showing The Black Candle.  So, I took my daughters to see the movie.  While we waited for the film to begin an attendant passed out popcorn. Shortly thereafter, the presentation began; Maya Angelo introduced all of the inexorable principles of Kwanzaa through the images of people of African descent.

Additionally, more recognizable contributors should have been included. Still, it was a good historical piece.",1264377600,4,277,5.95
8311702,5,B001J15PMM,Kwanzaa is a very special holiday and this DVD is a very nice beginning to understanding it. I really enjoyed The Black Candle and look forward to something more about my favorite holiday. I feel they did a wonderful job covering the topic and I also enjoyed the old footage too. This movie allowed me to research other topics by having a lot of different facet in the movie. Thank you for the information it was very enlightening.,1233532800,2,431,4.538461538461538

8311704,5,B001J15PMM,"You must have this DVD to show during your Kwanzaa celebration.  It is important for those, as I had been, who have never celebrated Kwanzaa before and even more so, for those who are born after 1970.  These young people generally have little idea about what had been happening in the country at that time, and what ""the Struggle"" means.  It is a powerful, eye opening film.",1231718400,2,374,4.552238805970149
8311705,5,B001J15PMM,The most powerful word I can come up with is Awesome!!  This was a beautiful documentary that not only speaks to Kwanzaa but the Black Power Movement as well. I thoroughly enjoyed it and plan on showing at our local Kwanzaa events. It is very educational and should be included in the study of the History of kidnapped/sold/bought/enslaved African people in relation to their journey here in North America. The quality is excellent. I applaud M.K.Asante Jr. for this work. Keep it Up!!,1229817600,9,485,4.843373493975903
