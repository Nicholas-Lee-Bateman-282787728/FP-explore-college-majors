8142944,2,B000I0RUSM,"I only bought this to see Madhuri Dixit. So I shouldn't, and I won't, complain that here, in one of her earliest roles, Madhuri is only part of the supporting cast and doesn't get to show off her dancing to any great extent. She and her character are fine as far as they are taken.

But what I mean by the title of this review is that, if you go on over to IMDB, you'll find glowing reviews of Swati. I presume that's because of its ultra-feminist position-which is exactly why I *didn't* like it. Not that I'm opposed to equality for the sexes, at all. But in Swati, Meenakshi Shesadri's eponymous character, especially at the start of the film, is made to be so rigidly and self-righteously equality-obsessed that she wants her company's operations manual renamed, to be a ""womanual."" She goes about with that perfectly self-assured conviction of absolute rightness that youth often has, lecturing people on how they ought to sort themselves out. It's not as if they don't need lecturing, either; it's just that Swati's self-righteousness is so damned irritating. It's perfectly appropriate, I suppose, that she meets her eventual life-partner in a Communist revolutionary want-to-be. Fortunately he turns out to be one of the nicest and most dependable people in this movie. (But I couldn't help but think that another perfect mate for her would have been Shashi Kapoor's equally rigid and self-righteous Ravi Verma, from ""Deewar."")

Swati's mother is a pip, too. Sharmila Tagore plays her with all the simpering faintingness of the woman exclaiming, ""Ohh! Ohh!"" in the old PBS ""Mystery"" frontispiece, with the Edward Gorey art. Completely apart from being told all her life that her father had deserted her mother, leaving the mother stigmatized as unwed and the daughter as a bastard, I could begin to understand Swati's ire when prim, self-pitying ol' Mom says things like, ""Learn to accept your fate as a downtrodden woman in this society."" That's not an exact quote, but trust me, the sentiment is certainly there.

The movie's pace is, well, ""languid"" would be kind of how to describe it. There's one song where things turn very colorful, where Meenakshi Sheshadri turns Odissi dancer and dances very nicely, but where the camerawork is like a bad combination of an amateur wedding film style, and the kind of film work they used to use in the 60s and 70s to emphasize how ""oooh! cool! groovy"" and psychadelic everything was. Otherwise, though, events just... happen. Maybe it's a ""realistic"" style or pace that will appeal to some. For me, though, I somehow kept wanting to prick myself (since I couldn't reach into the film and prick the characters!) and say ""Get ON with it!"" Said better, I suppose, I think that if the script had been tighter, providing more constant dramatic tension, the viewer's concern for the characters may have been increased, with a concomitant upgrade in the satisfaction achieved from experiencing the story.

I won't go over the plot, or how the story ends. Frankly, after watching for about half an hour, I stopped caring. But I'll say that Meenakshi Sheshadri, Madhuri Dixit, Akbar Khan, Vinod Mehra, Sharmila Tagore, and Shashi Kapoor all do well in their roles. Raja Bundela as Madhuri's boyfriend was a complete idiot, and not worthy of her... but that's just the way things went.

In the end, for me, ""Swati"" has early Madhuri Dixit and a chance to watch Shashi Kapoor as middle-aged man. I don't usually like Shashi at all in his young-man roles. But when he has to play middle-aged men, or films where he actually IS middle-aged, I find I like him perfectly well. I've read a lot about how admirable Sharmila Tagore's work in alternate cinema has been, but I saw no evidence of it here. In fact, the more I saw of her character, the less I wanted to see of her.

 I enjoyed Vinod Mehra in his small part; I'll try to remember to look for him in other films.

As a message film, though, ""Swati"" left me cold. For all Swati's femino-revolutionary talk, in the end all things are resolved along traditional-very traditional-lines. The only real change that may have occurred is within Swati's own character-that the viewer may, if he or she chooses, think that Swati has come by her experiences to have a deeper and mellower humanity than was present in her early, bloodless idealism. If that, indeed, was intended to be the real point, then maybe the film succeeds. But that's not the denoument I was looking for, and it's not the one I thought the film was pointing toward as it began. Hence my overall disappointment.

 But as I said, don't go by me.",1331856000,,4599,4.7808564231738035
