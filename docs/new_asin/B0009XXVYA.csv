8190206,5,B0009XXVYA,"Five stars! K.K. would have loved it! Story line, acting, cinematography, all without fault. If you loved Veronique, Decalogue, Three Colors, you will love this film. Not to be missed!!",1228003200,,185,5.2
8190207,4,B0009XXVYA,"Continuing in the tradition of Krzystof Kieslowski, this is another interesting movie that is thought provoking, metaphorical, humorous & emotional. The stories though separate have been split masterfully and seem interwoven to an extent that you'll be tempted to think that they are offering alternate & what-if paths.

I was particularly impressed by the depiction of vulnerability of love (something we take for granted). In one of the scenes the army officer loses the love of his life in a moment by lying about her to the Russian consulate. It is so easy to lose real love and so very difficult to get it back.

You'll have to keep your antenna up all the time lest be confused to no end. Very good stuff and masterful acting by Jerzy Stuhr.",1178496000,,747,4.7384615384615385
