7920071,5,B00004COTT,"Based on a George Simenon's play the central nervous turns around a couple with more than twenty years of being married. Somewhere across the line the love became mutual loath and he adopts a pet cat as emotional substitute.

The masterpiece of Pierre Granier-Deferre (The veuve Couderc) is incisive and the visual metaphor around the surroundings in which we may watch a crumbling city, where the houses are replaced by huge buildings is more than eloquent.

The pleasure for watching both monsters of acting like Signoret and Gabin is more than rewarding.

A sublime French masterwork, from 1971 and that deserved for both the respective Awards as Best actors in the edition of Silver Bear in Berlin 1973.

Available on DVD format in Amazon France.",1314057600,2,750,4.976
