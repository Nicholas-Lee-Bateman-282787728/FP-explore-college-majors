8046811,1,B0007CNXYG,"This series takes place roughly after the first episode of the Day the Earth Stood Still series.  Although it is nice to see some of the characters that die in the above series alive again, this is played more as a parody.  Don't get me wrong, I love parodies, but this one just isn't that funny.  Plus the series seems to be unsure if this is supposed to be a parody or serious so the result is largely uneven.  I would avoid buying this.",1158624000,3,439,4.190476190476191
8046812,5,B0007CNXYG,"Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot was my favorite tv show when I was a kid. Although I was a bit disappointed with the confusing story line of the animated Giant Robo (only saw VHS version, heard DVD dub makes more sense), I thought I'd get this video.

I'm glad I did. I especially enjoyed the first two episodes (the ones with huge robots fighting). It was an interesting glimpse into the lives of some of the characters outside of work.

Be sure to play it with the English subtitles on. The dub and subtitles are slightly different translations.",1144713600,2,549,4.5353535353535355

The oblivious Ginrei, however is more concerned about the disappearance of her favorite dress. This movie has great animation if you loved Giant Robo then get this.",1133481600,2,295,5.166666666666667
