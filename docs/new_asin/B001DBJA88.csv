We watched it asap and enjoyed reliving memories at the Shamu show.  And now me and my husband want to be Shamu trainers.  Loved the DVD!!!",1248825600,2,283,4.403846153846154
3528175,4,B001DBJA88,"I have a daughter with Cerebral Palsy who dreams of becoming a whale trainer at SeaWorld, ever since her grandparents took her there this last summer. She loves this movie, especially the bonus features where she can see the trainers interact with the whales. The music is catchy, and well done. This gets played often at my house!",1231113600,3,331,4.724137931034483
3528176,5,B001DBJA88,"Personally I'm a SeaWorld fan and Believe is one of my favorite shows in the park. I got the soundtrack album of the show and, as soon as it came out on DVD I got it too. I got it for only 15 bucks since I'm a passholder of the park and besides I got it in the 4th of July 2008 and they had some special discounts that day. It has some special features besides the show, like the making of the show and a behind the scenes special presentation. I just love it, what else can I say. Shamu Rocks!",1221523200,4,494,3.8529411764705883

8292613,5,B001DBJA88,my grandson Looooved it!  He was watching it on line but now he is so happy to have his own DVD.  He loves to go to Sea World.  Living in FL makes it easy for him to go as often as his parents want to take him.,1319587200,,210,3.425531914893617
8292614,4,B001DBJA88,"If you've been to Seaworld since '06 when they first started the 'Believe' themed show, you've probably seen this live.  The CD doesn't compare to it obviously, but does a good job triggering those memories.  Very good video.  Even better than the DVD, is the soundtrack if you can find a copy of it.",1275091200,,300,4.518518518518518
8292615,5,B001DBJA88,"I saw this performance in person and was Amazzzed!!!  I didn't buy the DVD at the park (should have) and wanted it after.  I found it for sale through AMAZON and ordered/purchased it...
I felt as if I was Right There in my seat Again!!! No Lie!  If you have seen this production and didn't buy the DVD, You Should... You won't be dissapointed!!!  Get wet again, and share the MAGIC with everyone who watches...  One of the Greatest things that I have ever seen in my 50 years of life!!!  My COMPLEMENTS to ALL those involved in Imagining and Creating and Producing this Wonderful Experience of the connection between Man and the Top Predator of the Sea... It will touch your Heart and bring tears to your eyes... Buy It!!!
Update... Now that SeaWorld no longer allows their trainers in the water with the Orcas, this DVD will possible become a Collectors item.  Also, my Condolenceses to Dawn Brancheau Family...  She Truely Loved what she did for these animals and gave the Ultimate Price, Her Life...  I never knew Dawn, but Her Dedication to what she ""BELIEVED"" in Will be and Inspiration to All who Love the Ocean and All of it's Creatures.",1260748800,,1144,4.568627450980392
