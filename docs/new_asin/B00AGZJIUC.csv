8551526,1,B00AGZJIUC,"I saw this old serial by Columbia Pictures on the Turner Classic Movies channel and it caught my attention, brought back memories. Finally, I found it available via GoZillaFlix and ordered it.  Immediately after receiving the DVD, I checked it out. I was very disappointed in the picture quality to the point I tossed it back in the container after viewing two chapters. The TCM presentations reflected perfect quality for such an old film.  I didn't return the ""item"" to GoZilla. Instead, I simply tossed it in the trash. Obviously, more efforts should have been made to enhance the film before making it available to collectors.",1427500800,,630,4.933962264150943

8551528,5,B00AGZJIUC,"Cause I'm old and when I was around 8 yrs old I would go to the theater in Holyoke Mass. and sit on the edge of my seat for that week's serial... how wonderful it was... now days it has a ""make you smile look""... given that Robin looks older than Batman and the Bat Car is an old convertible.. still it charms me .... and I still love it to this day. P.S. I already own it, I'm buying it for a friend.",1395532800,5,401,3.7857142857142856
