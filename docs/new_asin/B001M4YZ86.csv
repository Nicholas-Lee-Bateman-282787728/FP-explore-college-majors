3692240,3,B001M4YZ86,"Flashing back to the glory days of gory days, ""Gutterballs"" reworks a classic 80's teen-slasher formula and drops it into a bowling alley. Shot with a cast of unknowns, crappy lighting and cliched dialogue, ""Gutterballs"" looks and feels like it was flashed forward from 1982.

However, there is one notable exception. ""Gutterballs"" amps the sexual violence way past the norm with a near eight minute graphically sadistic gang rape that sets the rest of the movie into motion. It will repulse you and frankly, it sets ""Gutterballs"" close to a level of grindhouse porn. But then again, one of the first things you see is an eventual victim bending over in her oh-so-short skirt and exposing her camel-toe. The film does have 'gutter' in the title, and it more than lives up to its name.

Like all z-grade horror, there's a batch of (over the top) teens in some sort of conflict, and this time it's a pair of bowling team o'teens set up for an after-hours grudge match. Our hottie gets attacked before everyone shows up, but has something more in mind than calling the cops. When the opposing sides are gathered, suddenly the bowling alley is mysteriously chained shut and the grisly body counts and naked bodies start to mount. There's plenty of inventive murder effects to be had in ""Gutterballs,"" with one of the first being a couple smothered during (again, borderline pornographic) 69 in a restroom.

If it weren't for the fact that the action is so far past the pale, ""Gutterballs"" would be an utter failure. The cast rates barely past high-school improv and the script - well, my guess is the only things really plotted were the rapes and kills. Otherwise, there's about a page or meaningful dialogue to be cobbled away from the inane spewing of profanity and sex. There's probably more f--ks blurted out in ""Gutterballs"" than there was in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scarface/dp/B000GGSMB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scarface</a>, and that's saying something.

Is ""Gutterballs"" cheap and cheesy, slick and sleazy? Heck yes. Although I must admit, the ending did catch me off guard by about one third, so maybe pure gorehounds might get a kick from the naked boobies and the sexual violence. I can even say I liked this more than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hostel-II/dp/B000UJ48P4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hostel II</a>, so if you thought those were too tame, then ""Gutterballs"" is up your alley.",1231545600,57,2497,5.346055979643766

3692244,3,B001M4YZ86,"Well, this is a B movie that is written all over the movie. Yes it is a B movie.
The dialogue is all B type, the acting is pretty bad, the nutidy, rape shots are not all necesarry that are just for audiences sake, the brutal slasher shots are truely corney and are Peter Jackson's unwanted child all right.

Some people call it a horror film, some erotic film I call it just a B movie with all mixed up bag that is just for those who wants a movie for pure laugh and fun - I mean those who are ready for cult film's sake who have watched this kind of B type movies a lot. Those who enjoys Hollywood type of movies only that are released in the theater- good student type- should skip this one.

From the beginning there are unnecesary rape scene, nude scene.
And then there is bludy revange, cut off of the head, stab if the eye, medically cutten peanutes, stabbed ass with a bawling bal blood all over, chopped head, and so on.

But none of them are all serious.
You cannot compare this movie with one of the really serious horror like <INSIDE><THE WOMAN> and <FRONTIRES>,
There are totally from a different tree.

If you are a woman, you will feel a bit insulted somehow how the man treat women. I hated them too.
They shout, they tell women things to do in bad manner like telling the servants or slaves. Males rape things that moves as if doing to a sex toys. they curse like they speak daily words.
They all deserve to die which they will at the end.

If you want to see a slasher - a good corney one with a lot of blood, sexuality involved but nothing serious, this is the right movie.

Directed By: Ryan Nicholson
2008; Running Time: 95 minutes

Two groups of teens are allowed to hold a tournament after-hours at a bowling alley.  A brawl erupts, and all the kids are thrown out and told to return the next night to finish their game.  One girl forgets her purse, goes back inside, and is raped by guys from the opposing team.  Everyone (including the rape victim) returns the next night to continue the bowling tournament.  The teens notice a mystery player's initials on the scoreboard, and shortly thereafter, they're picked off one by one by a killer wearing a bowling ball bag (!!!) over his head.

The acting in this movie is terrible.  The whole cast is hard on the eyes, shrill and annoying--there wasn't one likable, sympathetic character in the whole film!  I'm no prude, but the near CONSTANT dropping of ""F-bombs"" got old really, really fast!  There is lots and lots of nudity (male and female), a graphic sex scene, a torturously long and brutal rape scene, plus buckets of blood and extreme violence.  Oh yeah, and an only mildly-surprising 'twist' ending.  All this is guaranteed to be a draw for some, but don't take that as a recommendation from me.  I say, avoid, avoid, AVOID!",1452556800,3,1268,4.792626728110599

Comparisons can be made as well to schlock kings Troma Entertainment and the Friday the 13th films.  So if you like all that stuff chances are you'll ""get"" the vibe ""Gutterballs"" is shooting for.

It reminded me of the good days of the 80s, lots of gore, nudity and just plain fun. This movie has ALL of that in spades. It feels like an old grindhouse/exploitation movie. The characters aren't the best(or brightest)out there but work for the sake of the movie. A brutal rape at the start sets in motion a bloodly trail revenge(and mutilated male body parts). Not for the faint of heart but gorehounds(like myself), horror/slasher/exploitation fans will LOVE this movie. I can say there was not a slow or boring part(in my opinion)at all in this movie. Once the killing starts its just relentless. Theres a few twist in the end also which i won't ruin and some of them were unexpected which is good. If you miss the old days of GOOD horror watch this and you will see there might still be hope for the genre. I will eagerly look forward to any other horror films this director makes.",1289865600,3,1046,4.453125

I loved the diffrent variations of kills that were preformed, and really enjoyed the cheesy grindhouse feel.

3692273,4,B001M4YZ86,"Gutterballs (Ryan Nicholson, 2008)

I grant you, Gutterballs is only going to appeal to a limited demographic. Probably a very limited one. But for those of us who get it, Gutterballs is a fun, albeit extremely mean-spirited, romp through our nostalgic pasts, yet it does something so few movies like this even attempt, much less pull off: updating the nostalgic for a modern audience. As such, you can't really call Gutterballs simply an homage; it is more than that.

The story, as you may be able to tell from the title, takes place in a bowling alley. Time: the eighties. And I will pause here to warn you that the soundtrack to the film is dead on, especially if you lived in Canada at the time (Chilliwack were a one-hit wonder down here south of the border). If you are under the age of twenty, you will never hear that much Loverboy concentrated in one area again, but believe me, as a teenager in the mid-eighties, I can attest it's accurate. In any case, two rival teams in a tournament come to blows. There is backstory to this, and much of it seems to have to do with Steve (Trapped's Alastair Gamble), the captain of the team of what we'll call the bad guys, having previously dated Lisa (Nicholson regular Candice Lewald), who dumped him for Jamie (Finder of Lost Children's Nathan Witte). I believe he's the team captain of the team we'll call the good guys. There's nothing subtle about this, by the way; the bad guys are all jocks (save the token nerd), while the good guys are ethnically and culturally diverse. Go figure. In any case, the owner of the alley (Retardead's Dan Ellis) chases them out, telling them they can finish the tournament the next night after closing. All is well and good, save that Lisa has forgotten her purse and needs to go back in to get it. She is ambushed by Steve and his cronies and brutally raped. The next night, the teams converge on the alley to play their game as promised, but they are not alone in the bowling alley... a killer who calls himself BBK is in there with them, taking them out one by one.

First and foremost, a warning for parents (like me) who let their kids watch horror flicks: there is a gorenography scene in this flick. As in hardcore. (And no, it's not the rape scene, at least.) Be aware before letting the kiddies watch this unsupervised. You were wondering what I meant by ""updated""? Yeah. I'm not sure the idea of gorenography had even occurred to anyone back in 1985. Okay, strike that. I'm positive it had, but before the advent of widespread direct-to-video, I'm not sure anyone pulled it off. I mean, think about it; horror flicks, especially during the eighties, are cesspits of nudity, sometimes bordering on the softcore. You know where they wanted to go, and these days, a few directors are doing it. Ryan Nicholson is one, and I think that had he continued on making this a serious gorenography flick, he might have come up with the best one to date. But no, it's just a single brief scene (and you know what happens to people who have sex in slasher movies).

The rest of the movie, well, it's got a lot of detractors. And they're right about everything they say. What none of them seem to understand is that everything they're ragging on is, for those of us who couldn't get enough awful eighties horror flicks back in the eighties, exactly what makes us want to watch the movie. The acting is terrible because the acting in eighties horror flicks is terrible. The score is cheesy because the scores of eighties horror films were recorded cheaply using cheap equipment. Etc. Where Nicholson spent his budget, aside from nostalgia items (you'll howl at the ball-waxer), was on the best-quality effects he could get for his buck, and they are miles beyond what you would see in, say, The Boogens or Satan's Cheerleaders (from 1982 and 1977, respectively, and having watched both in the past two weeks, I can guarantee this to be the case). That's the other part of what I meant about updating the movie.

Like I said, vertical market. But if you're in the vicinity of forty and had a love affair with bad horror movies when you were a kid--or if you still have a love affair with them--this will be right up your alley. I loved it. *** ",1285027200,12,4226,4.54664914586071

If any one of the following offend you then DON'T even bother with this film:

1. An EXHAUSTING/MERCILESS rape scene.
2. Extreme vulgarity.
3. An over abundance of obscene language.
4. Brutal gore/Decapitation by a shotgun blast.
6. Explicit sex.
7. Genital mutilation.
8. Sodomy by ? (Don't want to ruin the film!)
9. Nudity (Not just T & A, this goes a bit further!!!)
10. Bad acting/Corny jokes

You will read mixed reviews on Gutterballs and personally I thought it was very entertaining. This film is 80's camp with some modern day filth. Over bloody, over gory and at times quite hardcore. To Fans of slasher flix, rape/revenge flix and gore hounds: Gutterballs delivers a STRIKE! A great comedic, blood bath that should have you in hysterics. If you are a mild/mainstream horror fan or any of the above seem a bit unsettling then this film will most definitely catch you off guard and probably leave a sour taste in your mouth. 4 solid stars for an obviously limited budget and PLEASE, PLEASE keep the relentless spatter-trash coming!!!",1277337600,27,1084,4.817204301075269

3692279,4,B001M4YZ86,"About five minutes into this rape-vengeance-slasher you'll know whether this movie's for you.
If you last more than fifteen you'll actually be surprised at how much gore, camp, sleaze,
sex, rape, creative deaths, & undesirable characters can fit onto one disc.
I (an admitted gorehound) thought it was totally sick, way over the top, & campy in every way, shape, and form.
The very definition of shock-schlock.
I had to walk out of the room during the bowling pin penetration scene, while my wife stayed & watched with disgust.
(yes, you read that correctly)
It's definitely a throwback to bad 80s theme-slashers the likes of William Lustig flicks,
(whose movie, Maniac, they spoofed on the back cover)
with a hint of Joe D'Amato.
But it was also pornographic at times, not erotic either - sleazy,
Like Divine from Pink Flamingos sleazy.
If I found out that this was released by Troma (it wasn't ) I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.
I will say the sound was waaaay the heck off,
like they had one microphone, and everyone was trying to shout into it at once.
(I understand the reason behind it, but it's a throwback that should stay buried in the past)
The characters were so annoying you couldn't wait for them to die.
I wanted to bash that one guys face in myself,
he kept smiling that real irritating smile, like a mentally-deranged squirrel.
The fun part is every character is so undesirable, that when they die.. you cheer.
And rightfully so as gore is the real star here.
You can see they were trying to be creative with the deaths,
while still maintaining a certain level of shock.
As such every death is bowling/sex themed.
But as this was a rape/vengeance tale in a bowling alley you can understand why every death was bowling/sex themed.
The bowling shoe scene being the most retarded,
and the ball waxer scene being the best!!!!
This was actually a step back from the overly gory Live Feed, Nicholson's previous effort, which felt more professional, and restrained.
But it was a step back I found myself enjoying a bit more.

There is absolutely nothing I even remotely enjoyed about Gutterballs whatsoever. Two minutes into this movie and I wanted every single character to die because of how insanely annoying they were. The ""killer"", while at least original, is cheesy and just plain stupid. The dialogue and acting are on par with some of the worst I have ever seen in my entire life.

The movie goes a lot like this - Bad acting, bad acting, nudity, rape, rape with a bowling pin, bad acting, death, nudity, death, nudity, bad acting, etc., roll credits. I'm sure fans of Gutterballs are gonna think that I just ""don't get it."" That may be true and thats fine, I don't want to ""get it."" As a matter of fact, I don't ever want to ""get"" a movie this bad again. With that out of the way, on to my other point of view. This is what Eli Roth would be making if not for the backing of Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. The only difference between this and a movie like Hostel is about 30 million dollars and 2 big name friends in the movie industry. Gutterballs follows the same formula, ""Shock"" people with loads of naked women, buckets of blood, and painful scenes involving certain parts of the male body. If you like Eli Roth and Hostel-like movies, you might actually enjoy Gutterballs. I personally don't like either, this movie really makes me wish we could give zero star reviews.",1257984000,8,1726,4.430817610062893
3692281,4,B001M4YZ86,"""Gutterballs"" is a massive improvement on Ryan Nicholson's  weak, ""hostel"" wannabe, ""Live Feed"" and completely delivered.

If you hate gore drenched, nasty, sick, twisted, exploitative flicks then simply don't watch.

But if you fancy the idea of a well made (technically dubious dialogue recording aside), truly BALLS-OUT exploitation flick done with a fan's enthusiasm and a 70's/80's retro sensibility, topped off with wonderfully inventive kills and superb gore FX then here it is.

The acting is also not 'bad', as some reviewers have said.  It's amateur for sure but that does not mean bad.
Although (of course, NOTHING AT ALL EVER COULD BE) not up to the glorious standards of John Waters' movie acting it does have that same fun, go for it, heart in the right place amateur appeal for the most part.
Even the expletive filled script works in the context of the film and it's characters.

Exploitation can fans rejoice, while all others can pass on by and do themselves, and the rest of us all, a big favour.",1249430400,,1015,4.872093023255814
3692282,5,B001M4YZ86,"I'm very into weird and twisted horror and Gutterballs really does it. It had all the cheesy acting of a teen slasher film, plus the extremely brutal violence and graphic sex that you don't see often (enough?) in the genre. A few of the scenes are HILARIOUS, a few are incredibly shocking, a few are cute, and a few are so terribly acted that you can't believe you're watching the film.

I watch a lot of extreme movies, and I'm always looking for something that holds up to my desensitized brain. This hit the mark.

Also, Gutterballs isn't rentable on Netflix, so I bought it. I'm glad I did.",1242172800,5,594,4.440366972477064

The following murder scenes involve multiple scenes featuring genitalia violence. There is also a uncensored 69 scene, a porn scene! This movie should be xxx and not sold here on amazon.

3692285,3,B001M4YZ86,"Directed by Live Feed helmer Ryan Nicholson, Gutterballs is pure trash in every sense of the word, and is meant to be nothing more.  Obviously inspired by 70's/80's era grindhouse gore flicks, Gutterballs revolves around rival bowling gangs who get in way over their heads when a killer begins taking them out one by one with a bowling pin the night after a brutal gangrape take place inside the bowling alley.  That's about it for the story, and the characters are so annoying and over the top that you'll be praying for their bloody deaths, and that's just what you get.  The violence is brutally over the top, the sex is surprisingly graphic (and close to being pornographic), and the tone is very nihilistic, but there is some fun to be had for gorehounds with Gutterballs.  While the buckets of gore didn't bother me at all personally, the seemingly never-ending rape scene is what made me cringe the most.  While Gutterballs is an exploitation-esque homage of sorts, I found fast-forwarding through this scene was the best course of action.  Other than that, if any of the aforementioned sounds remotely appealing to you, then Gutterballs is definitely right up your alley.  If none of it does however, avoid.",1237939200,3,1215,4.840579710144928
3692286,5,B001M4YZ86,"WAHOO!!!!  70's grindhouse is reborn!  If you are a fan of over-the-top gory, horribly sleazy, demoralizing, shockingly offensive, just flat-out wretched cinema--THIS IS FOR YOU!!  It will most likely decompose every conscious thought from the haughty, feeble-minded movie snobs, but as for me...I marinate in the repugnant juices!!!

GUTTERBALLS is one vile exploitation/slasher/revenge flick.  Early on there is a completely jarring rape scene, one that will violate even the most soulless of scumbags.  It's hard to watch.  The trespassing sperm seem to be paying homage to Jodie Foster in THE ACCUSED, as the gang bang action starts off on the pinball table.

This terrible event sets a dark, uncomfortable tone that sticks with you for the rest of the movie.  Why would anyone want to witness this?  Well, first off, it's not real.  I am fascinated that the cast could delve into such a tough scene.  It would require a great deal of courage.  Plus any movie that can elicit such severe emotion, good or bad, has served its purpose.  Not for everybody though.

Fortunately the violence does gets more surreal, cartoonish, and gorily fun.  The bad guy sports a bowling bag on his head as a disguise, and goes on his ruthless killing spree.  The murders are super unique, highlighted by a death by 69.  Yeah, you read that right.  Not sure if that is actually possible, but it's must see(stuff).

This movie has gallons of blood and guts, bad acting, and more F-bombs thrown out than there ever was in Green Bay(F-avre bombs, get it?).  Plus it has full-frontal nudity, both the male and female variety.  Cheesy dialogue too, it just doesn't get any better at the bowling alley!

GUTTERBALLS is a combination of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, THRILLER:A CRUEL PICTURE, PINK FLAMINGOS, and maybe a TROMA/FULCI flick.  The greatest bad movie to come out of America in probably thirty years!

Anyone interested in taking it off my hands?  ""FREE OF CHARGE"" I'll even pay the shipping.  I actually bought this movie based on a couple of reviews.  Most likely the positive reviews came from narrow minded idiots who think any type of gore,(no matter how bad it is )makes a great horror movie.

It got so annoying when all you heard was the F word every second.  I've never seen a movie that had so many F bombs.  It seems the script was written by some punk high school kid that doesn't know how to create dialoge.  So, they just litter the movie with F bombs.

3692289,3,B001M4YZ86,"there was a lot of hype in the horror community over gutterballs. even i found myself scouring ebay for a a copy of this, several times almost dishing out upwards of $100 just to get this movie a few months before it's re-release.

while i did enjoy the movie and will no doubt pull it out from time to time for future viewing, i'm left feeling a bit unsatisfied. i'm quite possibly being unfair to the film and the filmmaker. this movie could quite easily be the victim of it's own hype thanks to the gushing praise on various message boards.

things of note:

* all the characters are annoying (purposely, i'd imagine). you will more than likely find yourself cheering their deaths. why? because once they're dead, you don't have to listen to them talk anymore.

* the 'f' word is used, literally, 516 times throughout the film, which barely breaks an hour and a half.

* one of the first scenes involves a girl in a short skirt sans underwear bending over quite a bit too far.

* two of the characters are snuffed out via a popular sexual position. the scene so graphic, you'll probably ask yourself if video stores keep this movie in the room blocked off by the big curtain.

* there's a nearly 10 minute gang rape scene that is extremely difficult to watch. no punches were pulled in filming this, and my hat's off to the director for that. in an otherwise comedic, 80s throwback horror flick, this scene is extremely brutal.

the acting is porn quality at best. dialog is knee-slappingly bad. still better than the director's other piece of crap, ""live-feed"" though. the fx and death scenes are pretty great, especially when this movie's budget is taken in to consideraton.

overall, a cool idea for a movie executed with varying levels of success. definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the 80s slasher.
