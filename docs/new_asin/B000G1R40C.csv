2599455,3,B000G1R40C,The only thing that really impressed me was the last stunt. He has been known to set up the people and everything else but I gave a three star rating just for the last one.,1213747200,,172,3.942857142857143
2599456,5,B000G1R40C,This was a great gift for the family. The things he can do just left us speechless. Great work!!! (But not for the faint of heart)...:),1196294400,2,135,4.230769230769231
2599457,5,B000G1R40C,"It was incorrectly stated that this was a waste of money is you owned Season 1. For those that want three episodes that are NOT included in Season 1, then it is worth getting. This was taped during Season 1, and they were left out of the Season 1 DVD package. It includes an hour-long Halloween Special and two half hour specials of highlighting the season. In those episodes were deleted footage that didn't make it previously into the shows for Season 1, as well as an extended two demonstrations that had to be shortened. Criss commentates in between the clips, and it is definitely a must for anyone who enjoyed the first season.
