Movies included in this set are: (1) The Big Trail, (2) Red River, (3) Legend of the Lost, (4) The Barbarian and the Geisha (first time on DVD), (5) The Horse Soldiers, (6) The Alamo, (7) North to Alaska, (8) The Comancheros, (9) The Longest Day and (10) The Undefeated",1368057600,8,510,4.425531914893617

5093795,1,B007KFZ7Y2,"I am not going to review the films in this set, it has been done by many others (better than I could have done) under each film's title. This review is for the package design. Once again I bought a new set of dvds that had all the discs jammed into cardboard pockets that are not lined with anything to protect the data side and all discs had some sort of scratches or scuff marks. When will the STUDIO HEADS that control package design listen to their customers? Bought this set to get the Barbarian and the Geisha and it had more scratches than any of the others. Also there is no information on the box or inner sleeves to let the buyer know which films are widescreen or which films have any extra features. The only good thing with the package design is the 7 nice pictures on the cardboard pages of the disc sleeves. Amazon should have posted an image of what the inside packaging looks like, showing the discs in their pockets, to inform potential buyers. At present I am watching the Barbarian and the Geisha and so far it has played just fine, and it is in widescreen, with good bright colors and a clear picture ( not fuzzy or grainy- but I am watching it on a small screen. If this film plays all the way through with no problems I will keep the set, I already have most of the others in some form or other, if it does not play then of course I will have to return it.",1343779200,135,1379,4.18796992481203

5093811,5,B007KFZ7Y2,"This is a really fine boxset with a couple caveats. The Longest Day has some DNR in it. It's not completely wasted but it's close. The other films range from decent to excellent transfers.

Excellent clarity and grain structure: The Comancheros, The Undefeated, North To Alaska, and The Barbarian and the Geisha.

Mediocre to decent transfer: The Big Trail, Horse Soldiers--The Big Trail at least was never in great condition to begin with.

Needs major improvement: Sadly, The Longest Day comes from the time of the first version of Patton, where studios were experimenting with DNR. The image has decent detail, but the grain is gone and the film looks too soft and plain. A 4K transfer here would make the film look amazing. Way too many pasty faces in this one.

Overall a fine set well worth your money. It's on sale for 20 dollars at times. Whenever they do remaster The Longest Day I will just put it in the case I guess.",1480982400,6,928,4.606060606060606

5093834,5,B007KFZ7Y2,"I grew up watching Western Movies and have been addicted to them for ages. John Wayne (Marion Mitchell Morrison) movies were always a favorite as you always knew that when good vs. evil the outcome was always (well, mostly) for the good. The white hat vs. black hat thing. Obviously there are much better movie critics out there!
My point is that I even (still) enjoy his old B movies and now have this collection in our DVD Movie Library.
 But the packaging is horrible. Fortunately, I have a DVD, CD polisher that took out most of the scratches caused by the cardboard packaging. I then put the DVDs into paper sleeves for long term storage.

While having these films on Blu-Ray is nice, the transfer leave a bit to be desired.  Granted they are superior to DVD, they are not up to current Blu-Ray standards.  The worse of the bunch is ""The Longest Day"".  The movie was digitally cleaned and any semblance of film grain is non-existent.  The movies is reduced to a cartoon-like image.

As others have noted, I've never seen Red River before but ""Wow!"" , it is one of the best movies I've ever seen old or new.

This meant that my three new disks had already suffered scratching from the movement inside the box set in transition. Was not at all pleased. I was excited to have such a nice collection of his films, but I would recommend thinking twice to purchasing this set as I have seen others have had similar results.

However, I might order a different set because I already have the Longest Day on a separate DVD.",1527638400,,333,3.911764705882353

The inclusion in the set of the Longest Day was the main reason I made this purchase as I already owned three other Blu Ray discs of the titles included.  Very, very disappointed.  I would not recommend the purchase of this item or any other Longest Day Blu ray disc.  This problem was not the vendor/sellers fault.  The price, condition and the speed of delivery were very satisfactory.  I would consider buying from this seller again.",1517961600,2,593,4.4953271028037385
