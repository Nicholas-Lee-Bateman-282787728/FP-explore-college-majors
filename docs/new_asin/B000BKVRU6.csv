The Battle of October 6th 1968 was to be sure of that. In that time however there were some films that were to make people forget such hard times, and Churibusco was where those films were made from.

La Princesa Hippie was a film that did such a thing, and it was one of many Rock and Roll anthem films that were made by the Stduio. The film was like The Prince, and the Pauper where two Babies were seperated at birth and later on reunited but had thier lives transformed as one took the identity of the other. In the end a girl who did not want to be Queen becomes a simple girl living a simple life in Ciudad de Mexico, while a girl who wanted to find a Prince and live a Princesses life, got her wish, thus proving that Fairy Tales can occur.

The Film was made with Enrique Guzman and two twin actresses who were Mili y Pili, as well as both Chabelo and Chespirito, in which the twins play the sisters seperated at birth, and Enrique Guzman plays the love interest of the one girl who does not want to be Queen. Chabelo plays a Rebel leader who tries to kill the supposed Princess and Chespirito plays one of the assasins; where all plans fail and the Rebels are destroyed.

The tale is with many good songs of the time, and with sceenes of a Ciudad de Mexico before the horrors of all out Smog and Crime as well as the aftermath of the Quake of 1985 and the Depressions of 1975 and 1995.

I love the films innocence and I also love how the film is one that gives such a great feeling of escape from a time that was troubling. I fully recomend it.",1150675200,9,1688,4.137195121951219
