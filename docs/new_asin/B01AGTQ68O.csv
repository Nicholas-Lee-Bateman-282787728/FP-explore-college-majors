8747347,5,B01AGTQ68O,"ReelClassic DVD is  truly a grassroots company. Owned by former film collector Mark Roth, he distributes DVD's directly from film transfers. NOT video sources.  I purchased this great set a few years back, and I can honestly say it's the best transfers of any silent Felix shorts. The musical score is appropriate, with some shorts being scored by Ben Model.",1470268800,11,358,4.95
