1423845,5,B00005BI90,"Placido Domingo is rightly considered a reigning Otello of the late 20-th century.  He has the voice, the looks, and the acting ability to bring the tormented warrior to life.
I have to recommend this full opera house version over the celebrated film version.  The main reason for it is that the latter has several frustrating cuts, including the Willow song and Otello/Iago duet ""Si per ciel"".
The supporting cast is very impressive.  Te Kanawa looks and sings an ideal Desdemona, even if she's not a mover and shaker in this role as Tebaldi in the past or Fleming currently.  Speaking of Fleming, when will we finally see or hear the MET ""Otello"" with her, Domingo, and Morris, conducted by James Levine?  It was broadcasted over the PBS, so I can't see why it can't be made commercially available.
The Russian baritone Sergei Leiferkus is an unusual Iago.  His voice is light and ""tenorial"" so to speak.  Thus, he sounds somewhat like Otello's darker alter ego, which is an interesting twist that makes a story more believable.
Solti, of course, provides a marvelous, brilliant sound, and the chorus work is very good.  The picture quality is almost perfect.
Don't hesitate; this is an ""Otello"" to treasure.",1048723200,10,1210,4.839805825242719
1423846,5,B00005BI90,"This is, and by far, the best Otello available on DVD. It is far superior to Karajan's with Vickers in the tiltle role and mainly technically where the movie's picture rarely follows the sound.
Also, we have here a much better Iago (seguei Leiferkus) who is far superior to Glossop's Ugly Iago. Glossop is vulgar in both singing and acting. Leiferkus is far from being great. He overacts very often (""L'o vidi in man do Cassio"" is desastrous)but is over all acceptable.
However, the main reason for owning this version is Domingo's Otello. Arguably, he is the Best. He has a weaker voice than Del Monaco (that is not necessarily bad) and he has a smaller voice than Vickers but he surpasses them both in the understanding of the role and in showing vocally Otello's power, rage and jealousy. And, very objectively he has a much more beautiful voice than both his ""rivals"".
Also remember that this is a DVD and we have to confess that No one acts as good as Domingo...
Solti's conducting is the other amazing feature and unlike Karajan there are no cut in the score.
Te Kanawa's Desdemona makes finally the perfect cake for this version...",1033948800,27,1138,4.666666666666667
1423847,5,B00005BI90,"I'm a big Fan of Placido Domingo I think he is the best Dramatic Tenor of our time. He is not only a great singer but also a great actor and that you will prove when you get to see him in this caracter. I am also a great fan of Kiri Te Kanawa and in my personal opinion I think if she is not the best lyric soprano of our time she is defenetly one of the best that we can get to hear. Her vocal technic is just perfect and for those who may think that she can only sing Mozart, Straus and Puccini you will have to think again when you get to see her as Desdemona, is the best I have seen. And I personal love this production because at the end you can get to see Princess Diane clapping and charing specially when the Diva Kiri's comes out to salute the public of the Covent Garden.

1423848,5,B00005BI90,"Otello has always been among my favorite operas. The first time I heard it was as a boy listening to my parent's Toscanini recording. While I am aware that there are those who regard this as a reference, I will withhold comment since I have not heard it for decades. However, in addition to this DVD, I have the Von Karajan film on DVD, and on CD, the first recordings of Domingo and Vickers, both on RCA, and Von Karajan's 1960s Decca recording with Del Monaco and Tebaldi. What for me separates this recording from the others is that it possesses a truly gripping sense of theatricality from all the principals involved. In contrast to the other recordings I have mentioned, this is a live rather than a studio production, and although I would not argue this automatically makes it better (assuming, of course, a comparable level of quality in vocal and instrumental execution), there exists the potential to reach a more transcendent level of intensity and involvement over what is generally achieved in a studio setting, and that potential, I feel, has been abundantly realized here.
More specifically, I feel that both Domingo and Te Kanawa sing beautifully while, at the same time, very effectively convey the pathos and suffering of their characters, and, I would add, that for Domingo, this is what distinguishes his performance here from his RCA recording (for a more stentorian approach, try Del Monaco with Von Karajan).
As for Leiferkus as Iago, I would disagree with those who regard his portrayal as undercharacterized. Perhaps his voice is a little bit on the light and dry side, and he avoids obvious theatrics. He does, however, convey Iago's evil and malice, just in a more subtle and restrained manner, all the more chilling and believable as a result, for Iago is supposed to be an insidious villain, not an obvious one.
Finally, Solti's conducting conveys true dramatic thrust and burning intensity. Only Von Karajan, I feel, in his Decca recording comes close.
If you want to see and hear how effective Otello can be in a superior live setting without paying the elevated ticket prices for actually being there, do get this one!",1021766400,51,2150,4.861035422343324
1423849,5,B00005BI90,"Of all the productions I have seen of this work, this is the one I keep coming back to. Domingo and Kanawa really get into their roles as Otello and Desdemona.  Their singing and acting  are first rate and become even more appreciated with repeated viewings. Sergei Leiferkus' Iago is not quite up to the elevated heights of his two victims, but he is anything but a weak link.  I prefer the less obvious suggestions of evil in his singing and in his acting, as that adds to the verisimilude of the opera as a whole--afterall, if Iago's evil designs were  transparent he would not succeed in destroying Otello. The singing is first-rate by all members of the cast, the Royal Opera House Orchestra plays beautifully under Georg Solti, making for an extraordinary production of  Verdi's penultimate opera. The entire final act is as good as opera gets--it is a revelation whose many nuances must be heard as well as seen. This Covent Garden production of Otello will  be the bench mark for all future Otellos on DVD for many years to come. The sound and the picture are both of the highest standards. This production will surely please both lovers of opera and those new to the genre.",1006041600,11,1182,4.631578947368421
1423850,3,B00005BI90,"To be honest, when I bought this recording, I expected more, but it turned out to be pretty week performance. The only bright point of that night appears to be Kiri Te Kanawa, who is outstanding Desdemona and nothing is new about it. But my dissapointment starts and ends with Domingo's Otello. He is not the greatest in this role, his voice is so sweet and gentle, he can not be the moor! Especially, I feel it in the second act, which is for me the best movement in the opera, it demands power and volcano type voice (as Del Monaco's) which Domingo certainly lacks.  However, his love duet with Desdemona in the first act is wonderful.
So finally, I think if you want to listen to Domingo's Otello you should try the other VHS, with Cappuccilli and Freni (in La Scala), it appears that that particular night Domingo's voice was much better than the night in Covent Garden. For the ""Otello"" lovers I recommend Del Monaco, Tucci, Gobbi recording, which is the best so far",1003881600,8,971,4.517045454545454
1423851,4,B00005BI90,"Shakespeare lovers should really become acquainted with the Verdi/Boito masterpiece. The drama has been not reduced but compacted to its essentials and recast in musical terms ... quite a feat of musical and literary genius.
I have seen and heard excellent Otellos, Mr. Domingo's certainly the best around today. It is destined to join Martinelli, Vinay, Vickers and (arguably) del Monaco in the top rank of Otello's in the twentieth century. Each one brought individual qualities to the part and made the role their own in their time.  My personal favorite has been Vickers .... for passion, musicality and heartbreak; the timbre of the voice and his ability to inflect it, seem to me qualities particularly suited to deepen this essentially introverted role.
Domingo is very good here, arguably better than in any other of his videos. Leiferkus is an excellent and most musical Iago .... a true believer in his creed. Solti conducts very well but does not reach the heights of others in this opera. Te Kanawa is in gorgeous voice, but throughout her career to this day she remains one of the most boring singers on the operatic stage. The voice is pretty but uninteresting, she follows her stage blockings correctly but, as Desdemona, not for a minute did she portray the incomprehension, anguish and final sense of injustice of the cataclism falling upon her. Dame Kiri for me is an excellent vocalist with a beautiful voice but not much of a vibrant opera singer. For Domingo and as a record of a fine live performance of Otello, this DVD is well worth the purchase. As a great performance of the opera it doesn't make it.",1003190400,,1626,4.827956989247312
1423852,5,B00005BI90,"My wife and I were in the audience at this performance, for this Royal Gala Performance of Otello on Tuesday 27th October 1992 with the video preset to record it for watching when we got home.  So you may be forgiven for thinking that I couldn't give a subjective review of this wonderful evening.
In the programme The Prince and Princess of Wales (although of course we didn't know it at the time it was actually their very last official public appearence together) wrote, ""As Patron of the Royal Opera we are delighted to join you this evening to celebrate the 80th birthday of Sir George Solti ... we wish you all an especially memorable evening.""  To us Brits, this is an even more poignant message because our dearly loved and much missed Princess and Sir George both tragically died in the same week.
So now reliving that night again 9 years on - well all the magic is still there.  My goodness what a fabulous performance this is.  Sir George gives an electrifying portrayal of this, arguably Verdi's finest score.  In fact, as a comparison we saw this production only a couple of months ago with Jose Cura and although it was a wonderful account of this fabulous score somehow Sir George has every nuance correct.
As of course does the exemplary performance of Placido Domingo, here he is the noble gentleman caught up inexplicably in unrolling tragic events.  I have seen his Met videos, courtesy of friends in NY, and I think at the Met he is a more effective and dangerous beast - but he was actually quite ill with 'flu during this run in London.  Still it is a wonderful performance - come on New York, isn't time you commercially released the two telecasts you have of Domingo's Otello.
Te kanawa is a gorgeous Desdemona - perfect in fact.  I never quite warmed to (if one can ever warm to this epitome of evilness) Sergei Leiferkus' Iago - the Daily Telegraph described his voice as ""needing some getting used to"" - I am afraid I never have, but my wife loves him.
This is a wonderful performance - as I write this it is the best selling opera DVD - so the viewing public must agree.
One final poignant moment from me - my mother in law was in the audience with us too that night, it was her last visit to Covent Garden before a very disabling stroke.  She is talking about the possibility of trying to visit the house with us this coming season - so in all for my wife and I, this was quite an evening.  I hope it is for you.",996451200,2,2441,4.404444444444445
1423892,5,B00005BI90,The music and the singing is exceptional.  Iago is particularly villainous.  Acting is Domingo and Te Kanawa  at their best.,1368748800,,124,5.1
1423893,5,B00005BI90,"what can you say?  Verdi wrote the most beautiful music ever and Domingo does it justice and then some.  The opening of this opera was my inspiration for the beginning of my doctoral thesis, so it has a special place in my heart.",1363651200,,229,4.3023255813953485
1423894,5,B00005BI90,"I received this performance by mistake. I had ordered a different version of Otello. This was fortuitous because this is a better performance that the one I thought I wanted. This performance stars the older Domingo. By the time of this performance, he had been singing Otello for 15 of his 25 year reign.  His voice was never as large as his competitors in the 1970s and 1980s. Jon Vickers and James McCracken both had large dramatic voices. Both very intense actors. Domingo stands out by the sheer death of his characterization . His voice has grown since he did the 1979 recording, but the individual sound and the soft grained velvet is still in evidence. Vocally, he is in good voice but for the botched high b natural in the "" Esultate"" entrance.  By the time he  reaches ""Gia nella notte"" with Te Kanawa, he voice is in full flower and the most beautiful duet Verdi wrote is presented sumptuously. The emotional vacillation of Otello is handled well and the contrast he brings in the final scene send chills up the spine. This is his best total performance on video.

Sergei Leiferkus is an interesting choice for Iago. His voice is not small as has been stated by others. It just happens not to be ""dark"" in the way we have come to expect from such as Sherrill Milnes, Justino Diaz, Merrill, Gobbi and others.  He gives us an Iago who's definitely over showed by Otello. His bright vocal color adds to his second banana status. His Iago cuts through the orchestra like a back-stabbing knife, and , for me, the contrast in his color with the text of the Credo adds to the sinister character of the music. He has all the tools and his acting is adequate to the production. I like him in this role.

Kiri Te Kawana is simply marvelous as Desdemona.  Beautiful, with creamy tone and her low key presentation is great counter balance for the fiery Otello.

Solti's reading of the score has no surprises. He is one of the best and he supports the singers wells. The hall at the Royal Opera House is smaller than the Met. This probably contributes to the consistent balance of singers and orchestra throughout the performance.

The production is a tradition setting in the proper time period. No time tripping here. I have seen several productions of Otello in the house and in video, but this one will be one of my favorites",1363132800,,2327,4.561151079136691
1423895,4,B00005BI90,"I saw Domingo sing Otello at about this time. This DVD is a wonderful souvenir of him in the role at that stage of his career.  Although the voice was smaller than some of the other famous Otello's, it carried through the house and had a baritonal timbre in the lower register that made him very effective vocally.  As for many tenors, his entrance, Esultalte, is an act of will to meet its demands.  All the other big moments are effected wonderfully.

His acting vocally and visually is superb wonderfully transitioning from swagger and impatience, through anger, to despair.  His ""Dio! mi potevi "" is spellbinding.  I have memories of the live performance during this aria in which my wife, then new to opera, sat leaning forward in her seat transfixed.  All in all one of the great Otellos that no one today can match.  I will look forward to seeing the Vickers, Met DVD for another interpretation.

Kiri Te Kanawa is also excellent.  Vocally she is quite good, and I found her acting credible--bewildered by her husband's anger and cruelty and resigned in the end.

The vocal weak spot is Leiferkus as Iago.  The voice is light  for Verdi and has a grainy sound.  That having been said, what one loses in not having a true Verdian baritone is in part compensated for by his superb acting.

Solti leads a well paced performance.  Stage direction is good though I prefer Act 4's ""a kiss, another kiss... to really be kisses rather than Otello crawling towards Desdemona as he sings them.  The staging is Covent Garden grand.

In summary, if you can accept Iago's voice, this is an excellent production and  preservation of a performance by an Otello who was a true presence in the role.",1265932800,4,1689,4.64527027027027
1423896,3,B00005BI90,"As I accumulate a library of Operatic and Ballet performances I am especially attuned to the technical aspects of the recording, such as audio mix, lighting etc. This performance has a less than perfect audio mix. The orchestra is well represented but the singers sound distant. Microphone placement maybe? It is one of the reasons many live performances that are recorded do not sound as good as the film version. The people who put a film together seem to be very good at getting these things right. I have to agree with the reviewer who praised Kiri and panned Placido. His acting is very good but this opera seemed to test his range. But this too may have been related to the mike placement. The lighting was also minimal in many scenes.",1220486400,10,741,4.621212121212121
1423897,5,B00005BI90,"I have known and loved this OTELLO for nearly ten years now, having first watched it on videotape.  The Elijah Moshinsky production for the Royal Opera, Covent Garden, taped live in 1992, features what could be Placido Domingo's definitive version of a role he began singing in 1975.  As I have Domingo's 1978 recording of OTELLO (co-starring Renata Scotto and Sherrill Milnes and conducted by James Levine), I can't help but compare his performance on the CD to that on the video.  His '78 account was wonderful from an interpretive standpoint, and vocally he was in his very prime.  But in '92 nearly every phrase, every utterance, was more intense than before, while his voice, fully mature and bronze in tone, was in excellent condition if not quite as free and ""giving"" as in '78.  However, his legato at the start of the Love Duet was still a marvel;  and his acting was brilliant.  As Iago's poison works in him, this Otello suffers the agonies of the damned, expressed physically (he clutches at his head when distressed, reminding us that Shakespeare's Othello is an epileptic) as well as vocally.  The climax of it all is a ""Dio, mio potevi scagliar"" that is greatness itself.  Surely Domingo's Otello was seldom any better than this.

Slender, blonde, and fair, Kiri Te Kanawa is visually an ideal Desdemona.  She looks beautiful in pale sea green and peach blush-colored dresses, designed by Peter J. Hall.  Those who know Te Kanawa's birth-year (1944) might be concerned she would have passed her vocal prime by 1992.  Not to worry:  she is in radiant, youthful-sounding voice here.  Her singing is passionate and emotionally involved.  As far as her acting is concerned, she is a worthy partner for Domingo.  The drama gains by her underplaying of certain moments (""Guarda il prime lagrime,"" for example).  One's sympathy is with her Desdemona throughout the opera.

I have mixed feelings about Sergei Leiferkus' vocal suitability for Iago's music.  One could hardly imagine a better voice for the CHARACTER of Iago:  a cold, heartless voice, poison as sound.  But it is not truly a Verdian instrument.  First, it is on the small side; this makes for an underpowered ""Credo.""  Secondly, Leiferkus cannot or will not use much mezza-voice, which means that his ""Era la notte"" lacks insinuation and nuance.  Yet this is an unforgettable Iago.  The usual approach (by both actors and operatic baritones) to this famous villain is to be affable and charming in the ""public"" scenes.  To Otello, Leiferkus shows a man utterly lacking in charm, who has but one saving grace:  total, even brutal, honesty.  Of course, this ""honesty"" is a pretense -- and to the audience Leiferkus shows a man with no saving graces whatsoever, an evil person to his core.

Covent Garden tenor Robin Leggate - always a lively singing actor - is present as Cassio, a role he made very much his own.  Bass Roderick Earle also stands out, as a sonorous Montano.  Mezzo-soprano Claire Powell is dramatically involved if occasionally hooty as Emilia, Desdemona's attendant and Iago's wife.

This is something of a minimalist production, not as sumptuous as one might like in certain scenes - the Act III assembly, for one.  Otello, who might be a sub-Saharan African or a Moor, is here made up as the latter.  The stage direction includes one moment in particular that symbolizes the cultural ""distance"" between Otello and his wife.  During the Love Duet, Otello, praying for the permanence of his newfound bliss, begins to face Mecca, arms extended; for her ""Amen risponda"" Desdemona gently brings his hands together, as if to form the traditional sign of Christian prayer.

Sir Georg Solti, the great Wagnerian maestro, conducts what is in some ways the most Wagnerian of Verdi's scores.  Predictably, his tempi are generally swifter than Levine's, and there is a bracing account of the ""storm chorus"" (""Dio, fulgor della bufera..."").  This first scene, it must be said, does not come over well on video, being too cramped and darkly lit.  But that and the aforementioned reservations about Leiferkus' voice are the only drawbacks I have found in this magnificent OTELLO -- a performance for the ages.",1202947200,4,4184,4.93839541547278
1423898,5,B00005BI90,"This is one of Domingo's best role, and

1423899,4,B00005BI90,"Verdi's ""Otello"" is one of the greatest 19th century operas. If in ""Regoletto"" the revolutionary idea of music drama was still in its initial stage, then in ""Otello"" Verdi, at seventy-three years of age, had fully realized the idea. Shakespeare's drama Othello couldn't be a better subject to develop a music drama, and Arrigo Boito's libretto was created for Verdi's miraculous music power. The grip is on right from the extraordinary beginning storm scene, and continuously the drama goes non-stop till the last note of the opera. Little will you hear the enchanting tunes that were abundant in earlier Verdi operas. In ""Otello"" music embraces the libretto as a whole, vitality and power emerges from within.

Domingo has been the world's leading exponent of Otello for over two decades! Comparing to other Otellos - Jon Vickers', for example - it was Domingo who realized every aspect of Othello I had in mind! This live recording of ""Otello"" from Covent Garden, with traditional and simple sets, conducted by Sir Georg Solti, would be a five-star production if with a stronger Iago. Serfei Leiferkus' baritone sounded too light for the role, although not lacking the nuances required for the character, his voice was a un-match to Domingo's warm and dark toned tenor. The vocal weakness marred the effectiveness of this villain character. Kiri Te Kanawa sang and looked an exquisite Destemona. She and Domingo made a great pair on stage. The camera might be a bit carried away at times that some close-ups were unnecessarily close.",1119744000,4,1535,5.043307086614173
1423900,4,B00005BI90,"This is a rather traditional, if spare, presentation of Verdi's masterpiece with a superb cast.  Domingo and Te Kanawa are at their peak and both sing and act magnificently.  The real surprise for me was Leiferkus, whom I have seen in person in the past and have not enjoyed; here, however, he is absolutely marvelous.  In short, you can't go wrong with this DVD, which should make a fine companion piece to the later film of Domingo and Fleming at the Met. And how poignant it is to see Lady Diana applauding from the audience during the curtain call.",1105833600,6,552,4.555555555555555
1423901,5,B00005BI90,"There are so many wonderful facets to this version of Verdi's Otello, and once you see it there will be no doubt in your mind that it's easily the best production out.

First, the cast.  Placido Domingo was THE Otello of the last thirty years or so, and he shows it here.  He has the age and experience to be Otello, but his voice seems to not have gotten the memo---his high notes ring with clarity, and his low range is just as secure.  Kiri Te Kanawa as Desdemona isn't the monumental Verdi role that you'll see in some of his other operas, but she holds her own and provides some intense moments with Domingo and complements him in their duets.  Sergei Leiferkus (as you can see from the other reviews) is somewhat of an offbeat Iago, but by no means inferior to any of the other recordings on DVD.  He has somewhat lyric qualities to his baritone, which most won't want to see in Iago, but his voice is at the same time clear, powerful, strong, and convincing as the villain.  All three act superbly, especially Leiferkus, who although at first glance most wouldn't pick as their Iago of choice, has become mine after watching this production only twice.  They blend well on stage, know when to recede and let the more important character shine, and carry the opera on their backs---all things difficult to find on the operatic stage.

Even the less often seen characters in this opera shine; namely Georg Solti, the ROH Orchestra, the production crew, and the transfering job.  Solti generally keeps in stride and status quo with his tempi, and lets the principles guide him when he knows they are ""feeling it.""  He lets himself be known, but doesn't force the issue.  The sets are generally traditional, and the camera shots are never eerily unneccessary (i.e., some Bayreuthe productions).  The best part is the tranfer from video to DVD, though---this could easily be the best musical recording of the opera as well if you wanted to simply close your eyes.

Solti, Domingo, Te Kanawa, Leiferkus, Covent Garden.  Amazing acting, wonderful staging, wonderful sound and a quiet audience.  What more could you ask for?",1089590400,7,2123,4.712737127371274

Solti's conducting is riviting: Kiri's Desdemona's innocence and love are effortliessly depicted: Placido's Otello leaves one satisfied with his singing, however his acting leaves me wishing for better. Now for Leiferkus's Iago. His voice, which has an unusual timbre, has a menacing quality which gives me goosebumps. He does not overact. Villains don't go around advertising their menace by being obviously dangerous. So too with Leiferkus. He is subtle allowing his voice to indicate his villainy while at the same time pretending to be solicitous of Otello's marital happiness. As a final note, I have not heard Iago's Credo sung as exciting as Leiferkus sings it. I have heard other fine artists sing it and they do it well, but they do not make me shiver while listening to Iago's evil befief system with such menacing satisfaction. I say to Leiferkus, ""Sing on and bravo.""",1417737600,5,1041,4.988505747126437
