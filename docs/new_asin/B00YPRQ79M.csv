I'm so glad I did =) While they did deviate from the anime a bit, it didn't take any of the essence away from it. I only wish they had subbed some of the news paper articles.",1458604800,,310,3.6417910447761193

8718737,5,B00YPRQ79M,"Really well-done adaptation.  Got me into reading the manga, with a truly unique premise.  The lighter aspects were reminiscent of the first Death Note movie, which I also liked a lot.",1447113600,,184,4.903225806451613
8718738,5,B00YPRQ79M,"This is apparently an all-region bootleg, meaning it's likely to be poor quality with bad English subtitles. Instead look up the Hong Kong blu-ray, which is region-A compatible with professionally done subtitles, and is the most superior quality. A well-done entertaining movie like this totally deserves that much.",1444435200,4,315,5.583333333333333
