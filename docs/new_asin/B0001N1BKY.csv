8014903,5,B0001N1BKY,"I have been a fan of SOS since the first album and I wanted to see some videos and this title fit the bill. It contains the best of the first 3 albums plus a bonus from ""The Living Return"" (1994).

The clips all have a story that fit the mood of the song from funny and whimsical (""Am I the Same Girl"") to dramatic (""Blue Mood"") but of course the majority of the music is fun so the pictures express that.

Lead singer Corrine Drewery gets the most face time (as she should) but Andy Connell shows up a lot and even former member Martin Jackson appears in the clips from ""It's Better to Travel"" (1986).

The picture and sound quality is excellent and I didn't see any issues with the copy I bought.

One interesting note is the song ""Twilight World"". The video is directed by Nigel Dick. He has since worked with Cher, Guns and Roses, The Corrs, Oasis, and host of other big name acts. To be able to see some early work by him was an extra treat.

Of course I wish I could see some clips from SOS's later albums and I hope that someday a DVD is issued from a live performance. Until then this video compilation will satisfy you as much as did me.",1118188800,11,1146,4.1441441441441444
