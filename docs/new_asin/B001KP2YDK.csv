3667807,5,B001KP2YDK,The kids and I have been watching this collection for days.....who doesn't love the old school cartoons?!,1397520000,8,105,5.235294117647059
3667808,2,B001KP2YDK,"Quantity overwhelms quality in this mostly familiar collection of public domain cartoons. However, once you get past the made-for-TV junk such as ""Clutch Cargo"" and ""Colonel Bleep,"" you will find six Fleischer Screen Songs from 1929-30, the Terrytoons classic ""Billy Mouse's Akwakade"" (1940) and Harman-Ising's underrated ""To Spring"" (1936). Occasional gems from Van Beuren, Ub Iwerks, Warner, Famous and Jam Handy emerge amid the dross. Loses a star for the ridiculous abridgement of the Popeye two-reeler ""Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp"" (1939).",1363219200,16,547,5.682926829268292
3667809,5,B001KP2YDK,"My child was so happy to get this video of his favorite cartoons.

You won't be sorry when you buy this product. I was pleased.",1361145600,10,182,4.083333333333333
3667810,5,B001KP2YDK,I used to watch some of these cartoons with my sons when they were young !  Now this one is for my grandson to watch !  The same cartoons as was on TV; now on DVD !,1340841600,3,164,3.4054054054054053
3667811,3,B001KP2YDK,"If you've bought any of the Mill Creek DVDs before then you should know that this 4 DVD set has a slight advantage over them mainly because they don't edit any of the cartoons or add their name to them. However, about 75% of the set consists of boring and mediocre cartoons (namely Mel-O-Toons, the Famous Studios Popeye cartoons, Clutch Cargo, and some weird cartoon series with a baby that turns into a superhero) and the rest being seen on other sets before it. There are also only 3 Looney Tunes on the whole set so if you're looking for those I'd recommend getting the Cartoon Craze or Toon Factory DVDs if you can find them. Another thing that brings this set down is the fact that 3 cartoons appear twice! (The Fresh Vegetable Mystery and 2 Mel-O-Toons) The title menu of the DVDs leaves a lot to be desired, also. There are a few upsides to the set, being that if you haven't obtained the Ub Iwerks DVDs there are quite a few of the ComiColor cartoons included, and if you love Betty Boop there are a lot of her cartoons (albeit as a costar in the majority of them) here as well. One other plus is all the Gabby and Hunky and Spunky cartoons are also on here. If you can get this set for less than $2, it may be a decent buy, otherwise spend your money elsewhere.",1331596800,39,1271,4.278008298755187

3667837,2,B001KP2YDK,"Guess all they had to deal with was 'public property' because most of what I've seen so far is REALLY OLD and not very well done.  I'm nearly 70 and remember a lot of these.  More of the better and less of the 'public domain' would have been nice.  If you want to see what entertained we old farts, this would be some of it.  If you want to see the better cartooons I'd recommend checking out 'lable specific' cartoons from the manufacturers and not a hodge podge of a variety of antiques.",1422662400,,489,4.225806451612903
