8192588,5,B000PMLJ1M,this was a great movie and I think it would make a great gift to give to some one and I would recommend it to some one,1375228800,,118,3.4074074074074074
8192589,5,B000PMLJ1M,"A must watch for car and racing enthusiasts. I'd recommend seeing First Stage first though as the characters will then be more familiar, however, I didn't feel the Second Stage lived up to the high bar the First Stage set. Instead it kind of felt like a ""filler season"" between First and Third Stages, while Third Stage felt like a bridge between 1st and 4th Stages, though I'm yet to see the 4th stage. That said there still are some important points visited for the overall plot of Initial D.

I'd say the Second Stage is the least important of the series but it's still plenty good enough to watch.",1315353600,,601,4.463636363636364
8192590,4,B000PMLJ1M,"Initial D. Stage 2.  Although not as strong as the first season of the series, stage 2 of Initial D is an enjoyable box ride.

The box set includes all 13 episodes of the second season of Initial D plus an OVA 60 hour long movie focusing around the female racing team of Impact Blue.

Disc 1 and 2 --- A new street racing team known as the Emperors' invade the prefecture of Gunma attempting to defeat all of the street racers in the area.  Team Emperor is arrogant, smug, cockey, and abrasive in their approach.  Driving Mitsubishi 4WD Land Evos the emperor's are lead by Kyuchi Sudo, a former stock racer and graduate of a top tier racing school in Japan.

The Speed Stars, Night Kids, and Red Suns unite to fight off this new threat.

The second half of stage 2 centers around Takumi and his development as a street racer.  Throw in a romance for Itsuki and the breaking of the relationship between Takumi and Natsuki and you have yourself a nice back story in between the racing.

OVA -- The OVA is about Impact Blue and the first half of the OVA is about Mako's psychological recovery after the events that unfolded between herself and Iketani.  A pair of Team Emperor races arrive in their town of Usui, thus Mako and Sayuki suit up in their Nissan Sileighty to fight off the challenge.

The second half of the OVA is about Sayuki and Shigo of the Night Kids attempting to 'set up' Mako with a new boyfriend.  It is a nice story that is more about relationships and the Mako character then it is about street racing.

Nakazato (Who develops a crush on Sayuki) and Shingo of the Night Kids appear in the OVA.

Overall Stage II and the OVA of Initial D is a good box set.  Once again Funimation does an excellent job with their dubbing.  The sound track for the OVA is pretty nice, and if you are a fan of the girl racing team then this DVD is a must buy.

I enjoyed Stage II for the most part.  The main matches that take place include...

Seji (Team Emperor) vs. Nakazato (Night Kids)
Seji vs. Takumi
Takumi vs. Kyuchi Sudo
Kyuchi Sudo vs. Ryosuke Takahashi.
Waterou vs. Takumi.",1307750400,,2084,4.352331606217617
8192591,3,B000PMLJ1M,"I began my Initial D experience with Live-Evil & Ideology's translation and reproduction of Fourth Stage.  It was near flawless in my opinion.  Every added subtitle and other translation (signs, etc) looked like it belonged there.  I'm not sure who produced this version, but the placement of the subtitles is horrible at times, i.e. placed so that you can't read it, and acceptable at others.  For example at the begining of a new episode when you see the Kanji title, the English title will often be right on top of it in the same color, so you can't read the title of the episode.  The subtitles also look like they are written in a low grade font, the letters are not smooth at all and look like they were added afterwards instead of looking like part of the cartoon (i.e. Live-Evil's version).

This version of Second Stage is on two discs.  The chapters are set up so that each chapter is an episode, as opposed to Tokyo Pop's versions which begin each chapter at a commercial break.  It means that if you want to see a particular battle in some episode, you have to fast forward.

I love the story of Second Stage, and while the animation is of course dated, it is better than that of First Stage.  Second Stage is short, having only 13 or 14 episodes, but the battles are memorable, and there is significant character development.  For example, you see Takumi go from this kid who knows nothing about cars and isn't interested in them, to having his head under the hood working on the 86 at the end of the season.

Overall, I don't regret this purchase, and I still pop this DVD in to watch some of the better battles.  Though, I really wish it was done better.  I would pay twice what I paid for this season if I could get a version with none of the production flaws that this version has.",1247011200,,1798,4.409090909090909
8192592,5,B000PMLJ1M,"I love the series. I'm a die hard anime fan and for a time was a street racer. So when I stumbled upon Initial D I was instantly intrested and once I started I couldn't stop. I bought each of the 14 disks Toyo Pop released of the series as they came out.

My only quesiton is does funimation have any more episodes in these sets than I have in my toyko pop dvd's? Someone please let me know.

Thanks",1234742400,,399,3.975
8192593,5,B000PMLJ1M,"Wow, I have not seen this one for more than ten years ago. Time sure flies. When I see this product in stores, I was a bit hesitating because I have seen the trailer in english dubbed and music changed. Once I have heard from friends who rented or owned it, they said the japanese versions were kept in tact. You know, they were right!. That made me happy. I tried to give english version a chance, but I cannot surpass the music, the new given names, and the new special effects during the race. It just not the same! Just to be fair, I will only review only the original japanese version. The picture and the sound are really clean for a TV series. The contents are kept intact. I do not recall any scenes have been edited out. It also include ""Extra Stage"" to complete the series. This is a surprising add on which I almost forgot about. I recommend who enjoys classic sport cars do battle and remind how good the cars in their time.",1202601600,3,936,4.264044943820225
8192594,4,B000PMLJ1M,I love initial D and drifting as a whole.  This box set even has extra stage included.  Second stage was good but it was too short compared to first stage.  If you like the series or street racing in general check this out.,1201219200,,223,4.1395348837209305
