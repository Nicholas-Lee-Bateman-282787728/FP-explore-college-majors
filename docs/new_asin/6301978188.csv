415898,4,6301978188,"Road to Hong Kong was the last Hope - Crosby Road film.  Dorothy Lamour only makes an appearance in this film.  Joan Collins is the love interest in the film - a beautiful spy for the top secret spy group The First Echelon.

Harry and Chester are a couple of con artists.  When Chester loses his memory in an accident, they are sent to a Tibetan Lamasery.  En route Chester is accidentally slipped a rocket fuel formula. While at the Lamasery, they find out about a rare herb that increases memory capacity.  The boys know this will make a great mentalist act for vaudeville and still it.  They steal a bottle and return home.  As a test, Chester memorizes the formula.  This sets the remainder of the film.  The First Echelon wants their formula and will do anything to get it.

This being the final Road film, lots of guest stars including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, David Niven and an early performance by Peter Sellers.

This is the most polished of the Road films.  Written by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank, who have collaborated on a number of his films including their Oscar nominated Bob Hope film The Facts of Life and Frank's best solo film, A Touch of Class.  Just sit back and enjoy.

415899,3,6301978188,"The Bob Hope/Bing Crosby/Dorothy Lamour ""Road"" pictures were the most successful film series until someone named James Bond came along. The Road To Hong Kong was a belated final entry - a nice idea but one executed on a miserly budget when the stars were somewhat past their peak. The script roughly follows the dependable formula of the earlier films and, while not as funny or as charming as the classic Road To Morocco, still provides a fair amount of amusement. It is certainly not the overcooked turkey that some people claim.

Cheaply filmed in England in black and white on cardboard sets and with special effects of rocket ships that would have made Ed Wood proud, the film relies a lot on the audience's affection for Hope and Crosby. The interplay and patter of their double act, so finely tuned over the years, is still a major attraction. Poor Dorothy Lamour is reduced to a guest star spot while the female lead is given to Joan Collins looking amazingly fresh and extremely sexy. One of the main embarrassments of the film is the love scenes between a visibly aging Crosby and the svelte young Collins. But, apart from that, she works quite well with the old troupers. And Robert Morley has a fun turn as a Dr No-type villain.

For me, though, the real star is Bob Hope in his trademark role as a professional coward with delusions of being a great lover. Whether tossing off a succession of quips or performing slapstick (with the aid of an obvious double) he breathes more life into the film than it possibly deserves. One of Hope's best scenes is with a pre-international stardom Peter Sellers who plays an eccentric Indian doctor. It is both fascinating and funny to witness this encounter between comic geniuses from different generations.

Yes, yes, yes...I know the film is creaky and looks older than it actually is. But it is also a lot of fun and has its heart in the right place. It's certainly no worse than any of the British ""Carry On"" films which have somehow been elevated to cult status. To paraphrase another fun film of that era - Hope and Crosby may have been past their prime, but what they had left over was more than most film comics started out with.",1094083200,33,2188,4.605128205128205

True fans will want this for their collection, and I agree that Hong Kong is not as bad as it is often portrayed.  In the era of Austin Powers, this film actually picks up some points for kitch; it was arguably the first spoof of the '60s spy thriller.
But there is one very unfortunate flaw in this DVD version.  Even though this is the first release of this movie in widescreen, this DVD is not optimized for widescreen televisions.  So if you have a wdiescreen TV this movie will appear letterboxed on all four sides, the frame of the picture will not fill out your widescreen from left to right.

415902,5,6301978188,"most often left out of lists of the popular ""road to. . ."" movies is road to hong kong. many people don't like it, but it is my favorite, it actually has a plot! (until the very end where it gets kind of odd) the story is about harry turner and chester babcock, con artists who, when the film begins, are on the eve of their newest scheme. they have hundreds of paying investors into an innovation that is supposed to use this rocket space suit thing and cause someone to fly. when the ""brave native"" that was supposed to demonstrate the suit backs out, turner and babcock have to come up with a plan. turner forces babcock in the suit and chester ends up flying through the roof of the warehouse where the demonstration is being held.
poor chester.
next we see harry visiting babcock in the hospital discovering that chester has lost his memory. he doesn't remember what girls are and what he did with them, what money is and what he did with it, and he can't even remember his own name. The former two seem to be of great concern to him.
harry feels terrible and takes chester to the best doctors he can find. a few of them tell him about a monestary where a memory herb is used. harry and chester find that this story is true and go to the airport. it is at the airport that they meet up with diane, a secret agent for a group called the third eschelon. she thinks that chester is her contact and gives him a secret formula that is needed to send a rocket into space. this third group apparently wants to beat russia and the u.s. to space and threaten to drop bombs on them unless they don't accept rule under their force.
at any rate, i won't reveal too much, but it is a very very funny film -- especially the bannana scene. i laugh so hard each time i see it. to me the chemistry of hope and crosby is at its finest. if you love the other road movies, then maybe you will not like this departure -- but there is so much more of the ""real world"" woven into this pic, you cannot help but love it. also, peter sellers' cameo is fabulous as an insane doctor, so buy this film or rent it today.

415903,3,6301978188,"This is the last Road movie made by Hope and Crosby. Both were around 60 and Crosby in particular looks stricken by the sophomoric playacting and the effort of simulating attraction to Joan Collins. Hope tries to jolly  him through their scenes together and manages to scare up a laugh or two,  especially in the pre-credit sequence. But it's only during Dorothy  Lamour's too-brief guest appearance that the old magic returns. At 47, she  looks younger than ten years earlier in ""Bali,"" but she was too  old for Hope and Crosby -- one of the sadder examples of male movie star  vanity and a sour note to end a great series on.

415988,4,6301978188,"In May 1962, theatergoers saw two movies about the space race and secret organizations intent on world domination. One was the first James Bond film (Dr. No), and the other was The Road to Hong Kong, the last Road picture with Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour.

Ironically, Hong Kong, the first of the Road pics to make it onto Blu-ray, is also the weakest. My 17-year-old son watched this black-and-white comedy with me and was surprised to hear that. He gave it a solid B.  It had some stupid parts, he said, pointing a finger at the ending, especially, but it was also pretty funny.

Hes right. While Road to Singapore (1940), Road to Zanzibar (1941), Road to Morocco (1942), Road to Utopia (1945), Road to Rio (1947), and Road to Bali (1952the only one in color) are all better, The Road to Hong Kong is still entertaining.

Comedian Bob Hope and crooner Bing Crosby struck gold in the 40s playing a pair of vaudevillians slash con artists who somehow got involved in dangerous situations, with Crosby always duping Hope and the two of them always running into the singing siren Dorothy Lamour along the way. In each installment there were corny song-and-dance numbers, plenty of jokes and one-liners, at least one opportunity for Crosby to sing, and running gags about how Crosby always gets the girl and the best of his partner.

Hong Kong was the equivalent of a reunion show, and Crosby and Hope have clearly lost a little of their comic edge. In fact, a younger Peter Sellers doing a cameo as an Indian doctor reminds us that the two stars used to be much faster and glibber with their banter. Yet, they weren't that old. Crosby and Hope were 59 at the time the movie was made, so its more likely that the 10-year-hiatus since they last worked together was responsible for the jokes not being as rapid-fire as usual. And while previous Road pictures were largely ad-libbed, this one felt mostly scripted.

Is that bad? No . . . unless you're Dorothy Lamour, who was relegated to a cameo nightclub scene. Instead, then-hot Joan Collins was given the female lead. She does a decent job, but the chemistry just isn't the same as it was when Lamour heated up the screen . . . and both of her co-stars.

In Hong Kong, which spoofs 60s spy films before many of them had even been made, Hope and Crosby play a couple of cons selling do-it-yourself interplanetary flight kits that ends up giving Hopes character amnesia. They go to a monastery for a cure, but along the way they end up mistakenly picking up a suitcase from a Third Echelon agent and are mistaken for the spies who are to give them a Russian rocket fuel formula. The plot thickens when Hopes character receives a memory boost at the monastery and he can rattle off the entire formula from pages that his partner sticks in front of him as a test. The result is that they soon become entangled with a Third Echelon agent (Collins) and end up at the secret underwater base where the Third Echelon leader (Robert Morley) and his chief scientist Zorbb (Walter Gotell) are preparing to launch a rocket into space carrying chimps. But what better way to dispose of an inconvenience than by substituting them for the apes?

A space gag about forced feeding of the apes goes on a bit too long (which will make it the only funny part for very young viewers), and yes, if you don't know the history of the Road pictures and how they break the fourth wall with almost every ending, the finale can seem hokey. But as a spy spoof and a Road reunion, The Road to Hong Kong does a pretty decent job.

And Olive Films, which has been producing a nice catalog of oldies on Blu-ray, did a very nice job on the transfer. It looks super, and sounds super. FamilyHomeTheater.com",1425600000,5,3732,4.541666666666667

416034,3,6301978188,"The last of the seven ""Road"" films, The Road to Hong Kong (1962), features long-time screen partners, Bob Hope and Bing Crosby involved in another zany adventure.  This time they are grabbed by enemy agents, and put on a rocket ship to the moon.  The final chapter in this long running collaboration features Joan Collins as co-star, and includes an appearance by Dorothy Lamour, who co-starred with Crosby and Hope in the six previous Road movies, beginning with The Road to Singapore (1940).  The movie also includes cameos by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, David Niven, and Peter Sellers as an Indian neurologist.

Diane (Collins) is a spy, who works for an organization called The Third Echelon.  She mistakes con-artist Chester Babcock (Hope) for a courier, and entrusts him with a secret rocket fuel formula.  Because of this error, Babcock and his partner Harry Turner (Crosby) fall into the hands of The Third Echelon, who plan to use the formula to take over the world.  Chester has acquired a photographic memory, and the rocket formula which is locked in his brain, pops out when least expected.

After failing to acquire the formula, the Leader of the Third Echelon (Robert Morley) has the partners replace a pair of apes on a rocket bound for the moon.  Acting as test subjects, they are force fed bananas, and after nearly crashing into the moon, return to Earth.  The boys escape from a captivity and are in Hong Kong on the run from the baddies, when they get some timely help from Dorothy Lamour, who is performing on tour.  Her one musical number with Crosby and Hope, is a bright spot.  After this, things conclude with a rocket ride to an alien world with Diana along for the closing song ""Teamwork"".

Paramount Studios released the previous six films, but United Artists produced The Road to Hong Kong, which came some ten years after last Road picture, The Road to Bali (1952).  With Bing Crosby and Bob Hope a bit older, Dorothy Lamour relegated to a bit part, and a screenplay that is somewhat below par, the film lacks energy of its predecessors, and unfortunately isn't that funny.  Joan Collins tries hard, and can even sing a bit, but she doesn't have the stature of a Lamour.

While inside jokes, and poking fun at various contemporary situations were a part of the previous Road pictures, after a ten year gap, switching studios, and a new leading lady, there's just not as much material to work with here.  While not the finest outing, this final effort is still recommended to fans of the Road films.",1327449600,,2529,4.737442922374429
416035,1,6301978188,"Wow, does humor from this era not age well. I remember watching these Road movies on TV as a kid, but they now seem so dated. I defy anyone in the 21st century to watch this and find any laughs at all. It's all cornball humor and bad innuendo (then again there's no explaining why people flock to Adam Sandler movies now) plus the typical Hollywood (i.e., Mickey Rooney in Breakfast at Tiffany's) tradition back then of having white guys play Chinese dudes.

The highlights are seeing a young Joan Collins and a great cameo by Peter Sellers (OK, now HE was mildly funny foreshadowing his work in The Party in his one scene) but other than that, not much here.

Also, the HK sets only really show up in the last 20 mins. Much of this movie is set in India and the Himalayas (actually it was all shot on London soundstages) so the ""Road to"" part of the movie holds true as it's mostly on the road to HK. When Bing and Bob get to HK, the depiction of that city is bizarre. Why are the street scenes so quiet? Did HK only turn to noisy chaos when color hit the big screen?

And did people sure did have different tastes in beauty back then as who in their right mind thought Dorothy Lamour (and she was only 48 in 1962!) was beautiful? I'm sorry but body aside that face is nothing to write home about especially compared to the incredibly hot 29 y/o Joan Collins.

The movie came out in 1962 but despite the ""going to the moon"" '60s theme seems more in tune with the 1930s. Bing and Bob were both 59 when this came out and they were looking every bit their age then.

Other than the movie itself, all you get on the DVD is the theatrical trailer as an extra. Not really worth spending even a penny on this Road pic. Hopefully, the earlier ones are much better and sharper with their humor.",1321920000,2,1786,4.241176470588235

416037,5,6301978188,"Having been around when Crosby began his reign as one of the Kings of Radio, Records and Film, (if not exactly cognizant of that fact at the time), and some years later, when Hope joined him in that status for Radio and Film, this is a sentimental journey. The last film in which Crosby starred (he did a few more in supporting roles and as an MC) and the time in which Hope moved to center his career in TV with an occasional film to help pay his taxes, this outing was essentially a reprise not only of their Road pictures but also of the many times on radio and TV in which they appeared together.  In other words, this is little  more than an extended comedy sketch like so many they had done before. The viewer should expect no more of it, should enjoy it as one last time to see two guys who were at the very top of the entertainment world in the second quarter of the twentieth century.
Approached in that manner, with no more expectations for it than I would of a Bob Hope or Bing Crosby television show, I found the film entertaining. Bing resting comfortably in his role of the Old Master (though both were still a bit shy of 60) who, more than anyone else, had created the dominant vocal style for pop music sitting between the eras of Rudy Vallee, earlier, and Elvis Presley,later, tossed off his one solo ditty commandingly, while he and Bob did their duets as stylishly as ever. Both handled the comedy efforts with ease and the brief love-making with Joan Collins with, I'm sure, awareness that they were too long in the tooth for it to be taken seriously by anyone. Joan Collins looks good fulfilling the few requirements imposed on her (none requiring more than rudimentary acting skill) while Lamour handled her cameo competently.
The music, script and filming did what needed doing without too much fuss or creativity.
How all this comes through for a post-Crosby/Hope crowd I don't know. For the rest of us it is a chance once more to see two guys who were up there when we were growing up.",1317081600,,2010,4.42972972972973

416041,3,6301978188,"This 1962 release of ""Road To Hong Kong"" marked the last appearance and ""Road"" picture the two legendary entertainers would ever make. While this film may not be as sharp as some of their original efforts of the 40s,it is still a quite enjoyable jaunt and worth seeing.
This United Artists film was shot in England at the famed Shepperton Studios. Melvin Frank,who was to become involved a short four years later in  one of my favourite comedies ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"",produced it. Toronto born Robert Farnon who conducted the Canadian Band of the AEF during WW2,does the honours in the music department;along with composers Van Heusen and Cahn.
The film opens with a song and dance routine of ""It's Teamwork"" on a vaudeville-like stage with a scenery back drop listing of all their past Road movies. The story starts in Hong Kong where a desperate Joan Collins, who works for an unspecified foreign power("" the third echelon""),is talking to American security people who are baffled hearing Amercian voices in a space ship going to the Moon(an obvious nod to the then heated space race between the U.S. and Russia).The story then desolves into events which led to that moment. We find Chester and Harry with yet another get-rich scheme in Calcutta,India with a flying device. Chester of course gets roped into flying it with disastrous results. He ends up in the hospital with no memory. A doctor played by Peter Sellers(who does a nice comedic turn) recommends he go to a monstary in Northern India to regain his memory. At the airport they bump into agent Joan Collins who mistakes Chester for another agent and gives him secret papers by mistake. The boys get to the monstary where Chester regains his mind with an unknown substance in a bottle,which they take with them(Watch for a cameo by David Niven).
Back in Hong Kong they discover the secret papers which they burn,but not before Chester memorizes the contents. Collins gets the two to come to Hong Kong and the secret underground facilities of her boss to give them the formula. Unable to get his recognitive powers back they put the boys on a rocket which is going to the moon and back,instead of two chimps that were scheduled to go. During the flight the gag scene from Chaplin's ""Modern Times"" is redone,where machines that are supposed to feed them automatically go haywire. Of course the food is bananas and milk.
When they return to Earth Collins learns that they boys are to be dissected after they have revealed the forumla. Having taken a liking to them both she helps them to escape. At this point we are regaled by a brief walk on by the boys old pal Jerry Colona. 77 1/2 minutes into the picture we finally see Dorothy Lamour,dressed in her trademark sarong. When the boys beg her to help them Chester says""Hey,you can't forget all those pictures we did together"",and she responds with""Neither can anyone else,that's why I'm working over here!"".She incorporates them into her stage show with some funny moments and about seven minutes or so  later Dorothy is gone from the film.
Chester and Harry return to the underground facilites in an attempt to stop them,now with the aid of the American security forces. They end up on the rocket with Collins and land on the planet ""Plutonia""(?) from whence they can never return. They of course vie for Collins' attention while doing their closing""It's Teamwork"" number,when suddenly Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra appear,for a brief moment. The picture ends with Harry getting the girl(as usual) and Chester floating up and away.
It's quite the ""plot"" to be sure but the story isn't the main thing here,it is Hope and Crosby;and neither disappoint. The usual bantering and one liners that made these pictures especially dear to their fans years before are here in abundance in this one too. It had been about 10 years since their last ""Road"" film but both Crosby and Hope jumped back into their characters like they had never been away from them;a testament to the pros both these talented men were.
Like all Road pictures before,there is no lack of music in this one either. As stated they did an opening and closing song and dance routine,about 35 minutes into the film they sing ""Road to Hong Kong"",at about the 60 minute mark Bing sings a nice number to Joan called""Let's not be Sensible"" and finally when Lamour makes her entrance we even get a song from her. None of them intrusive and all flow nicely in and out of each scene.
Technically this film has been transferred quite well and is generally clean and crisp black and white,in its' original widescreen 1:66:1 ratio. Other than the original theatrical trailer this DVD has no other special features,so it is pretty much a plain Jane kind of release.
In conclusion I do recommend this film for all fans of the ""Road"" franchise. Crosby and Hope are still on their marks and their famous zingers are still to be found in abundance throughout. Lamour makes her appearance(but late and too short)and there are cameos by many famous stars to boot. All and all a pleasant diversion and not a bad ending to a wonderful franchise that starred two of the most talented men in showbusiness,Bob Hope and Bing Crosby.",1244332800,6,5207,4.765227021040975
416042,5,6301978188,"In some measure, and regardless of subject matter, every motion picture is a product of its time.  The character of contemporary society creeps
in to script and inform the action on screen, shaping visual and verbal language.  Possibly overlooked by viewers of the ""Road"" pictures is the fact that each, in a reel and a real sense, was a parody of itself, and in turn, of the preceding films.  They were a gentle jab at an industry prone to take itself too seriously.  Revelling in their ability to glib and adlib their way from start to finish, Crosby and Hope always put on
a real-time performance, a passing glimpse at what they and their world were at that moment.  Amid the gems of repartee, some unseemly slurs at
misunderstood and maligned members of society emerge.  Not funny.

For what it's worth, there is one scene in ""The Road to Hong Kong"" that exhibits that classic comedic timing that left audiences rolling in the aisles.  A rollicking ride into space, strapped into seats designed for chimpanzees.  Use your imagination.  Crosby and Hope did.

416043,3,6301978188,"Released in 1962, ""The Road to Hong Kong"" was the final cinematic journey for Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and (all too briefly) Dorothy Lamour. Cheaply filmed in England with Bob and Bing past their prime, this uneven escapade proved no match for the previous entries. Hilarity does occasionally ensue, but replacing Dorothy with Joan Collins was a big mistake. In a memorable four-minute cameo, Peter Sellers steals the show as an eccentric Indian doctor. Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen contribute the film's best song, ""Teamwork.""",1226188800,3,527,5.1395348837209305

The old vaudeville schtick that worked with the first film in 1949 feels really out of place in 1962. There's a great cast with Bing and Bob (of course), Joan Collins, Robert Morley, Peter Sellers, David Niven, and Dorothy Lamour in a cameo appearance as well as a fine title sequence by Maurice Binder, who went on to design the intros of most of the Bond films. It predates the interest in spies and secret organizations that would become a mainstay of thrillers in the 60s-80s. Worth getting if you're wanting the whole set as I was. Sadly, this will only be watched once in my house.",1483488000,,740,4.408759124087592
7819870,4,6301978188,"This final Hope/Crosby ""Road"" picture was made a decade after their prior one, and in this one, they interact mostly with then-newer stars, with Dorothy Lamour only appearing toward the end. The movie begins with the vaudevillian song-and-dance number ""Teamwork"" where the stars prove they can still sing, dance, and interact like they did before.

But this story is different from their past ones. It begins conventionally where they run a scam in India, but Hope has an accident and loses his memory, and Crosby ends up taking him to a lamasery to get an herb to cure his partners amnesia. Mistaken for secret agents at an airport, they are given a rocket fuel formula which the cured Hope memorizes-and when the spies discover what happened, Hope and Crosby are taken to the headquarters of ""The Third Echelon"", and end up being placed into a spaceship and sent into outer space. Quite the road trip.

The song-and-dance numbers are fewer but still good, but as indicated above, the story is crazier than their previous ones, including the ending. Still reasonably entertaining otherwise.",1476576000,,1091,4.989010989010989
