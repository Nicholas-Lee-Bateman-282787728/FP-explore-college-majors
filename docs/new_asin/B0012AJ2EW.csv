3086210,5,B0012AJ2EW,This is by far the best instructional video on Shotokan Heian Kata's I have ever seen. Ertl and Bendickson are amazing teachers. Professionally produced and easy to use.,1200355200,3,169,5.071428571428571
3086211,5,B0012AJ2EW,"This DVD is absolutely excellent. If you are a student of Shotokan, this DVD will help you perfect your Heian katas. It is sometimes hard to learn a kata from the instructor alone; some people just have a hard time visualizing the steps, much less what each technique is actually portraying as far as practical self-defense techniques. This DVD makes each step of the katas clear, showing eacg from different angles and also showing the practical applications for each technique. I found that the lines which are marked on the floor were also very helpful. The demonstrations are great and provide the student with excellent examples of how the katas should look when performed correctly.

The quality of the DVD is wonderful and seems to be much more professionally filmed and edited than many of the other martial arts videos on the market. Overall, I highly recommend this, as well as the other DVD's by Joel Ertl and Anita Bendickson. Over the years, the high quality videos from these two instructors have helped me perfect my katas, as well as helping me better explain and teach these katas to my students. I absolutely can find nothing negative to say about these DVD's at all. They are top of the line and if you are a student of Shotokan karate, I urge you to get your own copy; they will help you on your quest to earn your blackbelt in Shotokan - bottom line. 5+ Stars!

Senseis Ertl and Bendickson are clearly dedicated to the spirit of traditional Japanese Shotokan karate.  Their dedication is obvious in the quality and completeness of this (and their many other) instructional DVDs.  I'm one of those people who has a hard time remembering katas, even after I do them many times over.  Along with my 3-4 hours per week in the dojo, I used this DVD regularly during my first two years of karate training in pursuit of my orange, green, and purple belts.  Other reviewers have mentioned the exceptional high quality production of this DVD, but I'd like to add that all of the video footage is shot, edited, and produced by the Senseis themselves in their St. Paul, MN dojo, which is the same place I and many dozens of diligent students worked our way through black belt any beyond over the past 30 years.",1203984000,7,998,4.584269662921348
3086220,5,B0012AJ2EW,"I've run a traditional Japanese Karate dojo in San Jose for almost 50 years. In a search to find a tape/dvd to help my students learn their kata better and faster (and motivate them to practice more at home), I reviewed every tape/dvd I could find on the subject. Joel Ertl's Heian 1 - 5 was the best, on many levels. It's not only clear and comprehensive in its presentation of the sequence of steps within each Heian kata (making it great for beginners), but also offers realistic versions of the bunkai (or self defense techniques hidden within each kata). Plus, it was obviously produced with very professional equipment, unlike many of the others, which are poorly edited and appear to be shot with hand-held, low-resolution camcorders. I highly recommend it to all my students. It is so good, in fact, and has sped up the progress of all my students who have bought it, I may require all of my new students to purchase a copy. I couldn't recommend it more.

8244939,5,B0012AJ2EW,Excellent!  This is a great video and very well produced!  I have bought a few Shotokan training videos and this one is the most comprehensive and useful.  I will get more...,1420243200,,174,4.548387096774194
8244940,5,B0012AJ2EW,"After several injuries, I cannot attend my dojo anymore. I was greatly saddened by this, but found an alternative in your videos. Though I will never progress, I can still maintain a certain level of my karate skills. Thank you!",1409529600,,228,4.725
8244941,3,B0012AJ2EW,"acquiring material on the dvd. 1st thing...the katas are well presented, as well as explained. I would recommend it for a beginner. That being said, there are some frustrations to contend with in re to navigating the dvd...real frustrations. Perhaps because the material was originally in VHR format and was not updated properly when it was translated to DVD. If it had been properly updated, I would have given this 5 stars...4 stars if they'd kept the original formatting but dropped the price 15 bucks or so.",1400284800,,511,4.885057471264368
8244942,3,B0012AJ2EW,Not sure where I went wrong on this one. Other reviews said this was good for beginners and it is not. A week into my karate classes and I need a DVD that I can practice the basic steps and blocks at home.  This DVD doesn't offer that. The chapter on step by step doesn't show the feet or legs at all. Just arm movements while the sensei is moving around through the steps. If you are far enough along where you can recognize the names of the steps/blocks/punches and know how to do them than this may be a good reminder on what comes next for each move of a kata but it's useless for anyone who is trying to put a name to a movement or just trying to learn a movement. I wasted 30 dollars on this one. Maybe it will come in handy in another 6 months or so.,1379635200,,757,3.947712418300654
8244943,5,B0012AJ2EW,"Cannot say enough good things about the material here. This is JKA style kata, and the instructors have taken great care to present the material well.",1377907200,,150,4.8076923076923075
8244944,5,B0012AJ2EW,"My son started karate 8 months ago and, being a squirrely little guy, had a hard time remembering his kata when there were other people with different colored belts practicing their own kata around him.  Since parents aren't allowed in his dojo, I was frustrated with how to help him practice at home when I didn't know what he was supposed to do and his little five year old self couldn't remember.  This video was perfect.  He loves looking at the application portion of the video and learning the ""why"" of memorizing kata and how it could be used.  We usually start practicing the ""move by move"" and ""breakdown"" so that I can see what he should be doing and help him correct things like turning over the wrong shoulder.  I love that I'm learning the correct terminology to converse more accurately when my son gushes over what he's learning in karate. By practicing and helping him learn the sequence at home allows him to get more out of his time in class with his sensei. When he's struggling with a new kata and the breakdown seems tedious to practice, going through a kata he's already mastered builds his confidence.  He loves racing the  video instructor during the ""speedwork"" portion.

The two things that I don't like in this video is that sometimes in the breakdown, the camera will be so focused on the upper body that I can't see the legs and so when my son asks if he should have a front stance, back stance, or horse stance, I can't tell (""ask your sensei"").  The other difficulty is that the camera switches from front to back depending on which direction the video instructor is going, which can be confusing for a little guy who doesn't understand that part way through the kata the instructor that was going the same direction as you is now a mirror image going the opposite way because the camera changed position.",1331078400,5,1836,4.573170731707317
8244945,4,B0012AJ2EW,"I found this to be a great instructional video. We purchased the video because it was recommended by my daughter's karate instructor for home training/practice for the kata. I gave the video 4.9 stars only because of being dated. Otherwise, the kata and the moves helped my daughter get her yellow belt. The video has a breakdown of the moves and there is a section where you can work through the moves quicker for more advanced practice. Great video. Easy to follow.",1314057600,,467,4.7073170731707314
8244946,5,B0012AJ2EW,"After taking a 30 year break from practicing karate, I found this DVD invaluable in helping me relearn the Heian katas. This well-produced DVD goes well beyond a kata demo, providing excellent instruction by showing each kata in three different ways. The video is clear and the accompanying commentary is very helpful.",1282089600,,318,5.134615384615385
