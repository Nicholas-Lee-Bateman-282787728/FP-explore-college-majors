6335492,5,B00J5LXS4U,Best Appleseed to date. Wish there was more like this!,1405555200,5,54,4.5
6335493,5,B00J5LXS4U,"great Movie Shirow's masamune best creation really glad to see more appleseed production and this was a great story and prequel to the rest of the story and yes we I have seen the film long before its blu ray release and no offense but to ask if we seen it before its disk release is dumb, to see things now a days before disk release or even theater is obviously easy to do you just really need to know where to look online but please support and buy original release.",1405555200,2,469,4.164835164835165
6335494,5,B00J5LXS4U,"this 3d anime is epic, the best appleseed i've seen to date, its certainly worth watching, its one of the most beautiful animated movies ive seen, the back ground is just epic. This is the kind of movie that inspired me to take up 2d and 3 animation courses and 1 day I hope to help make something just as wonderful.",1405468800,6,316,4.19672131147541
6335515,2,B00J5LXS4U,One of the greatest 'looking' 3D animated movies I have ever seen. Also one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.  This is a reboot no one asked for and adds nothing to the series with its existence. I know Dunan Newt is the star but they could at least try to do something interesting with Biareos? He is a tank that walks like a man but he's more of a glass canon in this film.  Appleseed Ex Machina has the best portrayal of him so far. Go watch that movie instead. It is more entertaining (my opinion).,1516924800,,512,4.11
6335516,4,B00J5LXS4U,"This appears to be part of a series that I have had no other experience with.
This is an animated high-tech military-oriented adventure with some sort of background.
It was enjoyable enough to cause me to put the rest of the series on a list of films to be seen ... someday ... if available.
Which, BTW, is high praise. Very few films reach that level.",1515628800,,352,4.348484848484849
6335517,5,B00J5LXS4U,I really enjoyed the prequel. And the post apocalyptic scenery was great. Briareos is definitely a favorite character of mine.,1509408000,,126,5.35

6335521,5,B00J5LXS4U,"I had seen it before and it blew me away. Shinji Aramaki never disappoints with the visuals and 3D art work in this anime. When I first watched it, I actually had a hard time distinguishing if Dunen was CGI or real. As for the story, I enjoyed it. Telling a pre Olympus origin story fills out the relationship between Dunen and Briarios brings life reality to the destruction of the world that man has brought upon itself.  However there is the conflicting question of when Bri became a hecaten cyborg in this telling and the Appleseed movie. But aside from that, if you are a Appleseed fan or just an anime fan of quality anime, then, this blue-Ray should be in you library. You won't be disappointed.",1503273600,2,702,4.484375

6335540,3,B00J5LXS4U,"The character animation was very well done but the plot adaptation was kinda weak.

6335561,4,B00J5LXS4U,"The movie soundtrack is off cue and misplaced.  The film isn't as good as the second movie as that was a John Woo masterpiece with great animation, action, direction, voiceover, and the IDM styled soundtrack.  It is interesting how they try to take us back to Olympus, but it is not as innovative as the first or second films.

Anime fans and fans of the franchise will be entertained.  However, for those of us that can remember the first two installments in the franchise, it is a disappointment.",1477526400,,498,4.625

6335574,4,B00J5LXS4U,"Intended as a prequel to the 2004 Appleseed movie, Alpha is CGI-animated film directed by Shinji Aramaki who also did the other two Appleseed movies, not to be confused with the late 80s OVA one-shot, or the Appleseed XIII remake.

 Before they were big shot officers in the utopian cyberpunk city of Olympus, Deunan Knute and Briareos were survivors of WWIII and operating as mercenaries in the ruins of New York City. Deunan is an attractive busty blonde, and her partner Briareos was a human given a fully cybernetic body which has little resemblance to a human. The two of them are currently under the employ of a cyborg gangsta named Two-Horns, while on a job for him encounter two fugitives being gunned down by gun mechas. Iris and Olson were sent from Olympus, which at this time is considered a myth, and assigned to deactivate a giant mechanical gun turrent. However, a rogue agent from Olympus named Talos and his followers plan to use the weapon to wreck what's left of New York. Deunan and Briareos set out to stop the revolutionaries, and save their city.

 This movie works as a stand-alone feature which doesn't require watching any prior material in order to enjoy it. There is some good CGI animation, although its seems the Appleseed: Ex Machina movie was better movie over all as it was directed by action great John Woo. It's worth a look as a decent post-apocalypse action flick, but not up there on the level of Mad Max.",1463011200,,1443,4.669291338582677

6335586,3,B00J5LXS4U,not as good as part one or two and Donan looks nothing like the original. Its an Ok stand alone story.,1461283200,,102,3.9047619047619047

6335612,5,B00J5LXS4U,I can't say enough about this and the first of 3 - Appleseed. And also the flick Vexille. The second Appleseed was good but first one and this one are my favorite of the trillogy. It was pretty awesome seeing what I think was the first of the mobile fortresses that were so freeking awesome in the first one. This is the way CG should be.,1444176000,,338,4.136363636363637

It's set a either a prequel or a reboot to the first Appleseed movie and the story is engaging.  It's a little difficult to tell how long this story is supposed to be before the first Appleseed movie, and I always got the impression from the first movie that Deunan hadn't known about Briareos becoming a cyborg before the events of that movie.

6335709,4,B00J5LXS4U,"If you haven't seen (or read) any of the Appleseed movies/comics, you can enjoy this computer graphics animation as a stand-alone film. Appleseed Alpha is about two ex-SWAT mercenaries Deunan Knute and Briareos Hecatonchires in the ruined city of New York in the post WWIII world of the 22nd century. They have heard of Olympus, a utopian city, but are not sure if it really exists.

And they don't have much time to think about it, when they are hired by a local gangster Two Horns to destroy the war drones and get the parts. Their latest mission takes an unexpected turn when they encounter two fugitives Iris and Olson running away from a certain group of heavily-armed cyborgs.

Instead of making another sequel, original series creator Masamune Shirow and film director Shinji Aramaki decided to continue the Appleseed series by rebooting it with a prequel. It is not a bad move focusing the main characters Deunan and Briareos, but the main story is a bit too thin for us to keep interested, and the two supporting characters Iris and Olson are underwritten.

The CG visuals of the deserted city and landscapes, as well as the weapons are probably the most impressive part of the film. The visuals are beautifully done mostly, with Briareos mechanic body that looks so real, but some movement of vehicles and humans during the action sequences look very awkward. Entertaining and much better than director Aramakis recent Starship Troopers: Invasion (I haven't seen his Space Pirate Captain Harlock), Appleseed Alpha still needs improvement.",1422835200,,1548,4.992248062015504

CGI was spectacular but the story is a little boring.  Nothing really good happens until the very end.  Plus I just couldn't get used to the English voices.  Sorry but anime MUST be in Japanese to me.  I never watch it dubbed.  I realize that the producers did this in English because the story takes place in New York and it makes sense but it just seemed weird.  This was made even worse by the fact that the English voice actors sucked!  The girl who played Deunan was OK and I like the guy who did the voice for 2-Horns but everyone else was bad.  Especially the guy doing Talos!  That guy needs to get another job.  His performance was the worst I've ever heard by an actor.

The voice actors are a little stiff, but the Two Horns and Brie characters are both good and fit their character well.

6335794,4,B00J5LXS4U,"I watched this in English since that was the default, which may have affected my review since I did not compare it to the original Japanese with subtitles. Sometimes the English translation has to make slight changes, and perhaps some parts of apparent bad writing may just have been bad translation or improve.

As a movie, its average, it has some decent parts and I truly enjoyed the Two Horns character, who as a side note seems to have been based on the Sokaku character's artwork from the original manga(who I wish will someday make an appearance in one of these films). There are moments of bad writing, and typical clich for science fiction movies. For anyone who wants a well written movie, I think this falls short.

If however you think of the movie as an animated art book, with the characters interacting purely for the sake of demonstrating the character models, it is excellent. Anything mechanical in particular was beautifully rendered. A certain massive mechanical machine makes an appearance, that has been featured in most of the movies in some form, and it is absolutely glorious to see in motion in this particular film, when somehow in previous incarnations it wasn't quite as stunning. Its a little hard to get used to the human characters who previously were rendered closer to an ""anime"" style in previous tittles like the Appleseed 13 miniseries and Ex Machina films, but that aside they are also well designed, save for the emphasis on a certain exposed area on Deunan.

Overall, I think most people would feel like this was a bad buy at full price, as a film should typically be great because of the writing and not the artistic aspects of it. As for my 20 bucks, I do not regret this purchase, everyone else out there, especially those not buying this ""Because its Appleseed/from Shirow Masamune"" may want to wait for it to hit a bargain bin, though even fans of the series like myself may feel a bit disappointed.",1414022400,,1944,4.711764705882353

This is a full motion capture animation and it looks gorgeous. Deunan and Briareos come to life as never before. Since this is a prequel it starts at the end of the world war and has Briareos and Deunan trying to survive in a ruined New York City. Deunan dreams of Olympus but doesn't know if it's real. Briareos is just trying to get by. They work for another cyborg called Two Horns. This is a new character voiced by Wendel Calvert. In many ways Two Horns makes the movie. The plot is relatively simple but the action is gripping (there are echoes of Star Wars too). I found that I preferred this to the original Appleseed since the characters are better resolved and more sympathetic compared to Appleseed and the plot and dialogue are more coherent.

6335842,5,B00J5LXS4U,"Just finished watching ""Appleseed Alpha"" released by Sony.
With breathtakingly releastic computer animation that mimics reality, ""Appleseed Alpha"" continues the story of Deunan and Briareos as they reluctantly agree to do one more mission for Two Horns - after their last one to deliver a vaccine - goes horribly awry - of course it didn't help that they were set up to fail.
How hope can be reborn is the essential ingredient in this part of the Appleseed story arc.  Briareos is suffering from mechanical failure that threatens to shut him down permanently.  Deunan's dream of finding Olympus - the fabled city where humanity is rebuilding anew - is fading into the glare of brutal day-to-day existence.  Their hopes are reborn when they resuce Iris and Olson - two citizens from Olympus who are on a mission to destroy a leftover doomsday weapon from the last war.
""Appleseed Alpha"" is an excellent entry into this science fiction dystopian future series.

The whole timeline laid out in the original movie was completely ignored.  Plus I did not find the movie that interesting, nor did I like the characterization of Deunan and Briarios.

The movies get closer('04, Ex Machina, Alpha) with each release, but have yet to capture that completely. Then again ...I'm a pretty hardcore fan of the manga(comic book) series. Almost more than Ghost in the Shell's manga. The CGI was awesome though! Shirow was always pushing the boundaries of animation in his manga, glad to see his animated movies continues to push the cutting edge boundaries.",1407628800,,774,4.827067669172933

I call this movie a reboot because of the glaring continuity issues that make it difficult to call it a prequel. The biggest being Deunan not meeting Briareos as a cyborg until she had reached Olympus.

That aside, the story is pretty weak and relationships seem forced. Appleseed: Alpha is more campy action than sci-fi. Not entirely unwatchable, but it's not as interesting as previous releases.",1407369600,,494,4.951807228915663

Only one character was actually entertaining and that was the minor villain Two Horns in the beginning. With the best voice over and the most personality I think he was the most thought out even though he didn't play much of a big part. CG aside there isn't much here and I'm would have been better off keeping my money.

Edit: After watching appleseed ex machina I realized that It had better a better opening better directed action scenes that are fun to watch, even if they maybe over the top. The music was much better though I suppose the music in alpha reflexed the devastated planet that was earth and personally I like the cell shaded look. Even though ex manchina was similar story to the first one, ""save olympus"" it was more entertaining then stumbling apon a plot to save...something.

I do like the fact that the voices are similar to those from appleseed exmachina. I would have liked to have seen a continuation, but this revamp was okay too. I will admit that detail was epic in this one. I'll be waiting to see Alpha II or Beta, whatever they name it as they do not find Olympus in this version. I have to also admit that I did prefer Briareos in Exmachina as his armor is upgraded to resemble more of a human and the look of the armor (to me) resembled a high tech body suit which helped to lend the character a more humanistic appeal.

6336042,1,B00J5LXS4U,"What happens when you give an American studio and the ""God of War"" writer access to a cult favorite Japanese property? I was hoping for something good, really. The first two ""Appleseed"" movies are much better than some people give them credit for, and I'm always sure to recommend the first one to those looking for a fun, futuristic thrill ride. It looked, from the trailers, like the prequel was on track to have an interesting set-up for the franchise coupled with some beautiful animation. Still, there were warning signs, like Deunan's absolutely moronic costume change to the unfortunate choice of generic, dated dubstep. I held out hope, and was promptly shot in the foot.

Without any exaggeration, I believe that I could fairly assert that ""Appleseed: Alpha"" is one of the worst things to happen to a great franchise since ""Metroid"" got hit by the speeding semi that was ""Other M,"" or when George Lucas thought Jar Jar Binks would be a genuinely worthy character addition to the ""Star Wars"" lore. Without trying to come across as a bitter nerd here, I'll keep details on why this is a bad ""Appleseed"" movie to a minimum, and try to focus on why this is just a bad movie, period.

First off, the plot, or what little there is, is one of the most contrived pieces of drivel to be churned out by a writer this year. We see the world in ruins after World War III, and series protagonists Deunan and Briarios are travelling through a ruined New York, running errands for a black stereotype that also happens to be a robot with devil horns. Off to a great start, I know. They're searching for Olympus, this fabled Utopian society that viewers of the previous films will be all too familiar with. Somehow, they get embroiled in a conflict stemming between a mysterious pair of androids and a young girl who is apparently the key to some nefarious scheme they're hatching. Will our heroes save this young girl in a suit seemingly made of latex? Will Briarios get the help he needs to repair his cybernetic body? Can this movie get any more cliche?

You probably know the answer to all three of those questions. Yes, this movie is comprised of some of the worst tropes to grace science fiction since its inception, and it doesn't use them in any original way. No unique twist or spin, just regurgitated archetypes and plot points that can be and have been executed in a far more compelling fashion. None of this is aided by the positively awful script and patently bad direction, both of which work in tandem to give the film an abundance of awful tough guy dialogue and stilted scenes rife with awkward pauses. From a narrative standpoint, this movie is positively broken down its very concept, and not at a single point did I begin to think this was a story worth telling.

To add a bit of a nitpick here, the characterization of Deunan here is downright awful. Here we had a character with an excellent personality who was unafraid in the face of adversity and handy with a gun. She had practical clothing for the battlefield, and stylish clothing for going out on the town. Brash but bold, caring yet tough, she was one of the best female anime leads of the mid-2000's when the first CG ""Appleseed"" film hit. Here? She's the stage nag to Briarios, who is actually the lead here, spewing macho lines and talking with a grizzled voice about the war. Deunan barely does anything except for act as a caregiver, fire off a few rounds, and then become emotionally overburdened at the drop of a hat. This is not the character fans know and love, and while I wasn't expecting good female characterization from the writer who brought us the ""God of War"" series, this isn't mediocre. It's bad. It's flat-out bad. But hey, at least we get a scene where she cooks, and the hilarious joke is that she, in fact, is terrible at cooking! Aren't those jokes still hilarious in 2014? So fresh!

Perhaps the only thing that ""saves"" this movie is the animation. I'm not going to lie here, it's what prevents me from giving this movie a flat ""F"" and going about my merry way. Make no mistake, this is a beautiful film. The characters are expressive, and the environments are very,very pretty. And on the rare occasion there's an action sequence that isn't botched by terrible direction or pacing, it can get moderately exciting for a few moments. Unfortunately, the budget sunk into it was squandered, as even the decent action sequences are very trite and worn, nothing like the high-flying, dizzying spectacles I've come to expect from this series. It's all very pretty, but very soulless and repetitive. Oh, yes, and Deunan's new costume is utterly stupid.

Also utterly stupid is every aspect of the sound design here. I don't have very much to say about it, other than it's basically sewage. The voice acting is tepid and bland at best, atrocious and grating at worst. It's all uniformly bad, and the more minor the character, the worse it sounds. But honestly, it's nowhere nearly as atrocious as the music, which is a completely disorganized mess. One second it's awful dubstep, the next it's a symphonic score, then trance, then rap, and then... you get the picture. And while variety is the spice of life, there's something to be said for knowing how to blend different things together in a seamless fashion. This film does the polar opposite and suffers gravely for it.

Ultimately, your enjoyment of ""Appleseed: Alpha"" will depend on how little you care about plot-to-visuals ratio. If you're the type of person who plops down money to go see a Michael Bay movie for the technical wizardry, or buys new games based on their graphical fidelity, you might enjoy this. There's nothing wrong this. I'm not one of those people, though, and that makes me the polar opposite of the type of person Aramaki and company wanted to pull a fast one over on. Banking on franchise good will and hoping to get away with just having pretty visuals, this movie falls apart the moment one begins to try and pay attention to the garbage plot, listen to the atrocious soundscapes, or expect any sort of interesting action.

The bottom line? ""Appleseed: Alpha"" is a bad apple in a franchise of ripe, juicy ones, and there's no reason to give it your time. Even if it does look shiny and delicious on the surface.

6336045,4,B00J5LXS4U,"It was (for me) the more enjoyable of the three movies by far. Fairly generic plot (with lots of the usual peculiarities typical to the Appleseed universe), but the dialogue was clever and the voice-acting was better than before.

The one thing to me, however, that are two glaring plot holes---made even worse by who wrote the script and who directed it.

This is supposed to be a prequel. In the FIRST Appleseed movie, we learned that (unless something really significant was lost in translation) Briareos was still 100% human while he and Deunan were together DURING the war. When they were separated, and she continued to fight, she had no knowledge of Briareos being injured to the point where the only way to save him was to make him the hulking cyborg that he is today. That makes their reuniting in  ""Appleseed"" so tragic. In ""Appleseed: Alpha"", Briareos is a full-on cyborg, and the war has been over for an unspecified time; still a long enough time for the war's end to be frequently alluded to as at least 10 or more years in the past (re: the young character Iris' statements that she doesn't remember what it was like before the war). ""Appleseed"" also states that the war has been over for a while, but ""Appleseed: Alpha"" seems to try to push it back even farther.

Umm... Huh???

Nevertheless, I think it's a shame that this movie has come out when it did. I think the rest of the Appleseed movies would have been better crafted had they started off this way, and worked forward towards their discovery of Olympus.",1405987200,9,1529,4.606617647058823

6336047,1,B00J5LXS4U,"Last week while I was getting my van serviced so it could pass the state emissions test for tag renewal in an abandoned parking lot of Sears store. I overheard that Glenn Becked fella on the radio. He was going on and on about how our border on the United States side to Mexico were unsecured. What a burden to our economy this fiasco was. So much so, that people were just crossing the border by the truck and train loads in unaccountable numbers. It seemed as if it was some coordinated invasion from an unseen mastermind.
Knowing Mr Beckett, I can only imagine who he was referring to.
Most of those people were unaccompanied minors. He went on how we should feed and clothe them to help them feel welcome here in America. That in itself would be cause for alarm for most people, especially their parents. Where were their parents in all this?
Indeed, where were their parents?
Years ago, my grandma and I had trouble with raccoons digging through our trash at night. It wasn't until we turned on the porch light or left the sprinklers on all night that they stopped coming around. After seeing an old black and white Disney episode of Davy Crockett, I realized that I wanted a coon hat like his.
That night I left the porch light and sprinklers off.
The next day, I went to church with a fresh new coon hat.
In what was initially considered an annoyance, became an opportunity.
The next day, I took my van down to the border and sure enough, groups of ten to fifty people were making their way across the border. It was difficult to hold back tears of joy knowing they would soon be citizens of this good nation and vote Democrat by right of passage.
Then, I spotted a group of kids and called them over to my van. I offered them employment on the modest plot of land  near my grandmother's trailer. There was a small partially underground tool shed they could sleep in to stay out of the Texas heat.
As we headed north, one of the kids wanted to drive. He must of been ten or twelve. In his broken English he said he had been doing it for years.
I believed him and he did prove to be quite the driver, albeit very slow. Sitting in the back of the van with the other kids, I put in this movie. I thought it would be an inspirational instructional farming video similar to what the Disney Johnny Appleseed was. This movie was far removed from being that. It was just a bunch of foreign mumbo jumbo and things blowing up unnecessarily. Beyond that, it was difficult to get past the lead girl and her crossed eyes.
We never finished the movie, but we still managed to enjoy the ride home.

6336048,4,B00J5LXS4U,"Appleseed Alpha is the prequel to Appleseed, the long running, post apocalyptic series that focuses on the characters Briareos and Deunan. Formerly SWAT members, and who would eventually become ESWAT members in the eutopian city of Olympus, this tale focuses on their adventures previous to their lives in Olympus. Taking place in the ruins of New York, the two work as mercenaries, primarily paying off a debt to crime lord Two Horns by doing various jobs for him. However, they find their true calling when they encounter Iris and Olson, two others on a secret mission.

To start off, this is easily the best animated of the series. Starting with the film in 2004, these have all been CGI animations, including the 2011 series. The CGI animation here is incredible and Deunan and Briareos have never looked better. Likewise, the action here is fantastic, wonderfully choreographed and entertaining. The two characters themselves are well developed and the fact that Shinji Aramaki himself returns once again to direct is very much welcome. The other characters here are decent, the standouts being Iris and Olson who prove to be a great matching pair for Deunan and Briareos. My main complaint lies with the villains, primarily the main villain who seems to be about as cliche as they come. His motivations are typical and he is typically evil, flanked by evil henchmen obeying his every order. The movie also spends a lot of time getting to it's point, where we tag along with our main duo at least a third of the film before we get to the meat of the story. Two Horns ends up over staying his welcome and becoming a needless part of the story with a twist that seems somewhat unwarranted.

While the story isn't quite as polished as it could be, leaving some to be desired, the action most certainly is. Unlike Ex Machina, the sequel to the 2004 film and the previous film to come out, Alpha doesn't try to make the action a centerpiece to the film. Ex Machina even brought in John Woo as a producer, which was evident in the way the action seemed to be an aside from the story. Here, it's fairly natural and fits right in with the story and characters. While the characters and story do certainly take center stage, the action is incredibly entertaining in the kind of way only a well done CGI film could be. None of it feels too flashy or there simply for the sake of being there, which is the mark of a great action film.

Overall, while not completely polished the way it could have been, Aramaki once again proves how to handle this series well. Strong leads, entertaining action, and a story worthy of the Appleseed name make this a wonderful fit and great primer for anyone who might be interested in this series.",1405900800,27,2724,4.647302904564316

8648404,5,B00J5LXS4U,"Not much else to say. Masterfully animated and everything is in high definition. The best 3D animated Appleseed available yet; all others, despite having their own style and charm, are lacking in comparison. It was the right decision to give everything more realism and an update to photo-realistic textures.",1519344000,,308,5.3061224489795915
