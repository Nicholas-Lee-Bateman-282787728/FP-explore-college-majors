2517524,4,B000EGDAN4,"The ""Dog Whisperer"" is a fine educational tool, as well as good entertainment.  Cesar Millan has succeeded in packaging his ideas and services for TV and landing a prime venue on the National Geographic channel.  I recommend the ""Dog Whisperer"" as a good introduction to understanding dog behavior.  There are certainly other excellent techniques, training tools, and programs that one can find to supplement and go beyond what is portrayed in the ""Dog Whisperer"" .

Cesar's methods primarily use ""energy"" and ""attitude"" to convey control and behavior messages to dogs.  His attempts to modify and control dog behavior may upset those who are not accustomed to controlling or training dogs.  Some owners just let dogs do what ever they want ... and the result is usually not good.  I don't see any negative aspect in Cesar's behavior modification methods (for both dogs and owners).  Change usually involves some level of discomfort, and in my opinion discomfort or inconvenience is the extent of what most dogs perceive.  Healing the situation in each of the human / dog families illustrated in the ""Dog Whisperer"" is a lesson in tact and psychological dynamics.

As Cesar says at the beginning of the show ""I rehabilitate dogs, I train humans"" ; the training of the humans is where the real issues are and it's excellent that Cesar shows us how we can be better humans for our dog's sake.",1197763200,6,1390,4.901709401709402
2517525,5,B000EGDAN4,"My daughter has two little Boston Terriers, so I bought this DVD for her.  She enjoys his show, but sometimes he comes on too late at night and she does work everyday, so as not to miss any of his shows, this was a perfect gift for her.",1181174400,4,236,3.9166666666666665
2517526,5,B000EGDAN4,"CelticRaven7 obviously has NOT seen even one of Cesar's shows - Cesar Millan uses 'dog psychology' and when you think about it, it makes perfect sense. It makes sense to the dogs too.  He can take dogs that other trainers have said were dangerous & needed to be put down, and in a matter of a few HOURS has completely changed the dog's behavior.  He does NOT use fear, or pain, or any other negative reinforcement, nor does he use treats, clickers, or other tools.  He has spent his entire life watching dogs (he grew up on a farm) and he has them completely figured out.  I merely TOLD one friend how Cesar 'rehabilitates' dogs who pull at the leash and charge other dogs, and with just ONE walk she had her dog broken of his bad habits. Which goes to show how thoroughly Cesar understands dogs, and how well dogs understand Cesar's psychology.  I don't have dogs, but I bought this for my girlfried with a pet sitting business, because she doesn't have cable. (if you still have doubts, check out his website, and see for yourself).",1178496000,15,1034,4.4787234042553195
2517527,4,B000EGDAN4,He is amazing and I wish I had these when my dogs were puppies!,1175817600,3,63,3.5714285714285716
2517528,5,B000EGDAN4,I found this DVD very informative and really enjoyed watching it.  I have loaned it to some of my family members who also enjoyed it.  I would recommend this DVD.,1173398400,4,162,4.366666666666666
2517529,5,B000EGDAN4,"I have read other reviews and done different training techniques.  I know from my experience, after watching the Cesar, it basically changed our dog life.  We have three dogs.  We have been through clicker training and individual obedience training.  They listen to us.  They are not food aggressive with us.  However, with three dogs the reality is there are pack issues.  They do have to be fed in order, they do have to be given attention in order. It is a known fact that especially same sex dogs can have aggressive problems between them because they are establishing top dog status.

Cesars methods are amazing.  What he does is basically show you how to redirect your dogs energy with a slight tug.  He has used everything from a gentle leader to a leash used as they do in Eukanuba Tournaments.  A slight jerk--not militant style--just a flick of the wrist and you are on the way to redirecting your dogs energy and attentions.  A small noise--no yelling, no aggression.  Nothing.  I have seen how phenominally it worked on my dog who I was told had anxiety problems.  As soon as I started using his techniques she began to use me as her beacon--if someone was at the door she looked to me for answers instead of becoming fearful or aggressive. He doesn't use choke collars or spike collars, just a basic leash.

The point is that to say that dogs aren't pack animals is completely off base.  Get a group of dogs together and they all run together, unless trained to stay with their owner.  And if its neutral territory they play happily.  Walk by a fence and look how a dog guards its territory.  Clicker training was really great for the basics and creating a well-behaved dog, but Cesar takes you beyond that to a very happy very stable dog.  It is just amazing.  There is no aggression, it is assertiveness.  It is saying I am your leader follow me, when the dog fights a flick of the wrist and a quick noise brings them back.  Can you imagine being able to walk three dogs behind with no pulling, tugging or fighting for first place?",1172102400,15,2046,4.527322404371585
2517530,4,B000EGDAN4,"Knowing your dogs alittle better can always help in happier dogs, and this dvd just opens the door in understanding what your role is with your dogs.",1170979200,,149,4.555555555555555
2517531,5,B000EGDAN4,"I have watched cesar millan for a long time. Someone, who apparently has not seen him, has issued a review saying that he inflicts pain and ""bullies"" the animal to show them who is boss. What nonsense. He empowers dog owners to take the leadership role in the owner/pet relationship. He is the most loving owner of animals that I have seen and his animals adore him. He takes throw away animals (he has about 40+) and has them in his dog compound. He exercises them and runs on the beach with them and they have a better life than many children in this country.

His expectations of owners and pets are high. Anyone who follows his advice and works with their animals like he advises will have a happy experience with dog ownership.",1163980800,21,732,4.462686567164179
2517532,5,B000EGDAN4,"Cesar has an amazing way about him.  He is calm, assertive, and completely rational, no matter what the dog is doing.  People often treat dogs as the person would like to be treated, as opposed to how dogs want and need to be treated.  In each and every case, it is the human creating or making the issue worse.  Cesar begins by training the human, which enables the dog to begin to lead a wholesome life.  Disagree that it is the human with the problem? Then why are you thinking of purchasing a dvd for a human to watch and learn from?

It is Your Actions, the Human's Actions, that will make the difference in your dog's life.  Cesar lets you know that you have the power to help your dog with whatever problems it may have.  He isn't a fluffly, new agey type of person, despite the title of the show.  He gets things done, and he does it with compassion, intellect and the strenth of his personality, which he passes on to the people he trains.

Contrary to an earlier review, I have never seen Cesar cause any pain, emotional or physical, to any dog in any of his instructional vidoes or episodes.  In fact, in one episode he works with a chronically ill woman who has almost no upper body strength, and is basically a fragile human being.  Despite all that, she quickly and easily rehabilitated her dog's aggressive behavior, with no further worries that she will have to physically restrain him.  She was able to accomplish the training without any help besides verbal instruction from Cesar.

Any of his episodes or instructional videos will help you understand dogs and what they need, and how you can give them a good life, therebye giving the dog owner a happier life in return.",1161907200,39,1689,4.495081967213115

8109079,5,B000EGDAN4,"He is so wonderful with not only animals but with people.  He has helped so many and I love his show on Animal Planet.  Have the DVDs though, I can watch him over and over.",1358380800,,172,3.8857142857142857
8109080,5,B000EGDAN4,"The debate between ""force"" training and ""reward"" training has been going on at least since the 1980's when I began teaching dog obedience. Force training is anything that makes a dog do something. Lightly pushing on his rear so he will sit is considered ""force"" even if it is not hurtful at all. On the other hand giving a dog a treat (reward training) is not ""bribery"" and if used correctly the dog is weaned off the food treats in the training process. Both methods work on dogs. In my experience it is the person that has to decide which method to use, because different people are not able to or want to use certain methods. Again, in my experience a combination of ""force"" and ""reward"" work best, but many dog trainers see the world in Black or White and insist everyone use the same method. Too bad.
Cesar is able to explain many ideas and actions in ways that pet owners can relate to without making them feel like idiots for the mistakes they are making. And he rightly tells people that not giving their dogs enough exercise and mental stimulation is often the root cause of dog behavior problems. But, many of his techniques are not practical for the average dog owner. Also he often doesn't actually effect a permanent behavior change. Often months later the client will mention that their dog is ""making progress."" That is not the same as being done. There are many books and DVDs that will walk a person step-by-step through many obedience tasks. Classes with an actual teacher work best. In the best case scenario the experienced teacher can see your interaction with your dog and teach in a way that is best for both you and your dog.

The DVD itself is clear and clean and the episodes are very interesting to watch.
There are only three episodes but it will leave you wanting to watch more. The three titles are: Harry and Brooks, Sueki and Coach; Gus and Ava. If the seller had put these titles in their description they wouldn't have gotten so many 1* reviews.
All in all, I enjoy watching Cesar's DVDs.",1356480000,,2022,4.53972602739726
