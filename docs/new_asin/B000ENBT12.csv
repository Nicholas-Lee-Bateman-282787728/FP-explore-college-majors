8111576,5,B000ENBT12,"This is an approach to playing/improvising in guitar where John Abercrombie encourages you to forget much of the theory you may have already absorbed and simply think a phrase then try to play it,concentrating on what you feel inside rather than visualizing a fingerboard. Part of this is having you play on just one or two strings,play just two notes to the bar a bit like a bassline(to make your note choices stronger),inventing a motif and re shaping and refining it to how you want it to be. It can seem a little abstract compared to being spoonfed five tunes via a tab book,but this is all about flying without a net to catch you,how to fall and how to create tension via rhythmic emphasis. You have to think and fell to play like this and,to an extent,teach yourself;John is as much a guide as he is a teacher. It's a beautiful disc and the performances bear repeated listening-it's a bit of a shame these two guitarists didn't record a duet,there are some tasty grooves being cooked on this recording.
  I'm a finger style player trying to wean myself away from just trotting out party pieces and this is possibly one of the best purchases I could have made,short of a series of quality one on one lessons with a master improviser. As another reviewer says,it aligns well with the Mick Goodrich book and much of it harks back to the gospel of Jim Hall.  Highly recommended.",1470182400,,1380,4.578947368421052

While John Abercrombie is an extremely accomplished guitarist (I especially enjoy his trio work with Dan Wall), he is not on the same level as a teacher.  If you are looking for jazz guitar lessons in the sense of licks or concepts broken down into sizeable chunks, I suggest:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joe-Pass-Jazz-Lines/dp/B0001UZI1U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joe Pass Jazz Lines</a>&nbsp;or Vick Juris&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guitar-World-All-That-Jazz/dp/B0047YHMOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guitar World: All That Jazz</a>.

This is not the place to start if you are beginning a Jazz guitar instructional DVD library.  However, what this video does well is allow you a glimpse of the path a highly accomplished jazz guitarist has taken and where it has led him.  John discuss the processes he uses to improvise and compose and gives some encouraging words.  It is more abstract than immediately actionable.  This video feels an awful lot like an informal meeting with a guitarist who has internalized a good amount of Mick Goodrick's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Advancing-Guitarist/dp/0881885894/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Advancing Guitarist</a>.",1310947200,2,1368,7.107142857142857
8111578,4,B000ENBT12,"John Abercrombie does not know what he is doing?
I guess that's in spite of his 40 + year professional Jazz recording and performing life.
Maybe its YOU that does not know that they are doing?
So, let's hear your music.  What CDs do you have available?  What label are they on.  What Jazz festivals and clubs are you playing at?  I'd love to check out someone that does know what they are doing.  I can't believe that I've loved Abercrombie's music so long and never realized that he does not know what he is doing.  Thanks so much for setting me straight.",1217980800,4,556,4.349514563106796
8111579,1,B000ENBT12,"I have several ""instructional"" DVDs and all of them are awful. Nobody can teach someone their own theories and approach about guitar. I don't care what other people say, you can't be taught improvisation. Sure, a person can run through chords and scales and show you how to finger them, etc., but I'm sorry improvisation cannot be taught and it doesn't help when you have a jazz guitar master like John Abercrombie showing you all of these notes and phrases and doesn't explain what he's doing. The bottomline is he doesn't even know what he's doing!

The icing on the cake to a truly terrible DVD is the guy who's sitting next to Abercrombie the whole time, John Basile. What's this guy sitting there for? And this Basile guy asks Abercrombie one stupid question after another.

Don't waste your money on buying instructional DVDs, because the truth is no one can teach you improvisation, because improvisation is something you learn after you learn to play the guitar. All of this reminds me of the old saying ""Those who can do. Those who can't teach.""",1183075200,,1054,4.7228260869565215
