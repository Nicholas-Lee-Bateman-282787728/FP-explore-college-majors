I am a big fan of kung fu movies and

3060118,4,B00114UU9U,"Ti Lung plays a poncho (!) wearing swordsman baaaaadaaaaasssss by the name of Fu Hung-hsueh with a deadly cool in this ""spaghetti Eastern"" directed by Chor Yuen. That's enough back-of-the-cd-case info for you - let's answer your question ""is this worth buying?""

YES. Buy this. Buy it so hard.  Moving on...

THE MOVIE

Ti Lung's Eastwoodian performance (hard not to make that comparison, especially with the poncho) is nicely balanced by Lo Lieh's, as he portrays a formal rival who enjoys the finer things in life who accompanies Fu Hung-hsueh for most of the film. The two enemies are brought together in the first moments of the film for a rematch of a duel; however, party-crashers show up intending to kill Lo Lieh's character Yen Nan-fei, which doesn't sit well with Fu Hung-hsueh, on principal. The two decide to take off after the one who hired the killers and settle their business later. Along the way they meet a colorful cohort of villains, including a girl with (literally) killer poetry, a mad monk, and a gamesman who plays a living chess match with our heroes. Stealing the limelight from the rest of the rogue's gallery, though, is the unforgettable Devil Grandma. As Lo Lieh says, ""Devil Grandma's really nasty."" (easily the best subtitle of the movie) Nasty or no, she'll steal your heart. No, I'm serious.

Our heroes, the villains, and the requisite Damsel in Distress (played by the achingly beautiful Ching Li)vie for film's macguffin, an ancient Chinese nuke, more-or-less, called the ""peacock dart,"" through a serious of good to great action sequences, culminating in a faceoff between Fu Hung-hsueh and a mysterious mastermind who would have made a great Bond villain, Yu Kung-tzu. Who IS Yu? Well, if the movie had been in English, originally, his name would have been a clever pun. I won't spoil the surprise but the ending gives you some nice lite philosophizing.

THE THING ITSELF

The movie is mostly dark - I'm not speaking metaphorically. It helps the overall tone, but the limitations of the restoration process show. The interlacing doesn't help, either. That said, the image quality isn't bad at all. It's quite a bare-bones package - the extras are, as usual with the Image Shaws, just some trailers. No complaints - the worst that can be said is they didn't package it intending to ""wow"" anyone.

On the whole, THE MAGIC BLADE is a great ride. Gritty enough for mild abrasion, but with enough Saturday Morning Appeal to satify almost any audience (some nudity and suggestive situations keep it out of ""for the whole family"" territory). This would be a good intro to wuxia for the first-timer - it has enough western action tropes that it won't be outlandish or confusing to those raised on American and European action films while still maintaining a distinctly Hong-Kong-ian flava*.

Over the course of the film, if you have any doubts as to the identity of Fu Hung-hsueh, there are repeated reminders: ""Fu Hung-hsueh is...Fu Hung-hsueh!"" That's right, viewers, THE MAGIC BLADE gots itself a catch-phrase! And a pretty good one. And a groovy, too-cool-to-be-seduced-by-naked-evil-hotties, pistol-gripped-sword-wielding hero who can shuffle around his internal organs (you'll see what I mean). Put this one on your short list of movies to watch.

On mountains old, the pine and bamboo grow.

The prolific Chor Yuen (Intimate Confessions of a Chinese Courtesan (1972)) whose work covers many genres was an important director with The Shaw Brothers, but today his oeuvre is known less than Chang Cheh and Lau Kar-leung. The genre that I am most familiar with from his films are the wuxia adaptations from the Gu Long novels including this one which was taken from a popular novel (the Chinese title of the film is the same as the novel). While his direction was usually fine he had a habit to trying to fit in an overabundance of plot turns and characters that can be typical in adaptations of literature. I felt this was a hindrance to many of his directed films such as Bat Without Wings (1980), but in this movie it worked quite well. So far, and I have many more films that I would like to see of his with most not available on R1, this is easily my favorite movie directed by Yuen.

The Magic Blade is a consummate wuxia adaptation in the jianghu universe (jianghu literally means lakes and rivers but has come to mean the fictional world these fighters inhabit). The best wuxia films have hearty heroes, sundry and plentiful villains, diverse powerful weaponry and a complicated plot that I will eschew discussing too much about in this review. This film has all of that. We start with the solemn hero with an absolute code of ethics bemoaning a lost love because of his quest in becoming the number one martial artist. Who better to play this than the stoic Ti Lung as Fu Hung-hsueh? He resembles Client Eastwood in the Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name trilogy* in attire while his character is much more chivalrous. Every wuxia badass must have a sublime and deadly weapon and Fu has his unique titular sword in tow. It is a blade that can swivel like a tonfa and looks like it would work well in mowing down your lawn as well as your enemies.

To be number 1 in the jianghu universe it helps to have spent years dedicated to becoming the best swordsman possible. It also helps to obtain a weapon that is so incredibly powerful that it can be used against those swordsmen who have wasted years learning their art to be number 1. What is a sword compared to the powerful Peacock Dart which can kill everything in range except your own fighters? How the device knows that I am not sure but I liked it much more than the spider weapon in another Chor Yuen film The Web of Death (1976). It does have another issue where it can only be used a few times, but we will ignore that as well. The Peacock Dart has been safely hidden away for many years at Peacock Mansion but a rising antagonist the mysterious Master Yu wants to obtain this magnificent weapon. Fu is entrusted with this weapon as it is no longer safe at the Peacock Mansion, but that now makes him an even bigger target than before. Will Fu survive the onslaught to finally face Master Yu (whoever he/she is)?

There is so much to like in this film. Tang Chia's (Shaolin Intruders (1983)) and Wong Pau-gei's fight choreography is excellent. While each fight tends to be short (Dr. Craig D. Reid notes that there are 22 fights for a total of 14 minutes and 8 seconds of action in his fun compendium The Ultimate Guide to Martial Arts Movies of the 1970s) the variety of weapons and situations employed are awesome. One of my favorite fight scenes is the human Chinese chess game where Fu gets caught up in the schemes of mini-mastermind Ku Wu-chi. The characters, especially the bad guys, are diverse, plentiful and quite memorable. My favorite is Devil's Grandma (Teresa Ha Ping who has been in at least 243 films) a cackling elder, who has a penchant for human pork buns, can do complex martial arts and would probably poison her son. But there are many other characters from bad guys who would rather play chess, an effeminate swordsman, a sympathetic Lo Lieh character (or is he) and countless others who will be introduced and then dispatched with quick efficiency by the hero (for example: here's a bad guy who gets a Chinese title on the screen, you think he must figure prominent in the story, wait now he is dead, never mind). The story while somewhat complicated but not overly complex like Chor Yuen's The Duel of the Century (1981) is full of plot turns and interesting scenarios with my favorite being the town of the dead (Yuen would repeat this scene in Bat Without Wings).

I easily recommend this to fans of wuxia. I am not sure how well others take to this because there is a fantasy element to these films that some people have trouble connecting to (not sure why when there are so many sci-fi and comic book hero films that skew reality) and the plot is one you do have to pay attention to and a second viewing does help. But this is a brilliant and fun film. The cinematography by Wong Chit is beautiful (he had already been working 20 years), the sets are ethereal and beautifully crafted and the fights, scenes, characters mentioned earlier help form one of my favorite Shaw Brother's films. Now taste my thunder bullets.

The movie has a sequel named Pursuit of Vengeance (1977: Chor Yuen).

The Image R1 release I reviewed is good though it could have been clearer in the transfer. It also does not translate signs which can be annoying for films from this genre where they are prominent and important. There is an English mono dub as well as a Mandarin mono dub. For extras there is a Production Stills Gallery, 16 new Shaw Brothers trailers at a little over 17 minutes and incredibly under Other Titles You Might Like a total of 13 Image Asian trailers that is over 46 minutes long. Unfortunately, and this upsets me, the IVL R3 release has interviews with Chor Yuen, Ching Li, Yuen Wah and Jade Leung. It also has a commentary with Bey Logan.

* Another western influence can be seen from the beginning with a tumbleweed blown in a windy deserted Phoenix Town leading up to a duel between Yen Nan-fei (Lo Lieh) and Fu (Yuen Wah doubles these leads for the more difficult martial art scenes).

The Magic Blade directed by Chor Yuen is a heavily action driven, kung fu film with lots of sword play and fantasy elements. It tries to squeeze in a little bit for everyone; evil characters, romance, small amount of nudity, and even light lesbian action. At its core, the film is a straight up action flick, but the ending attempts to make sense of all the chaos with its main theme that isn't fully realized until the epic showdown by the end.

The action scenes are pretty much what is going to hook most viewers and they are plenty. They occur almost after every single character interaction. The choreography is splendid during the one against many showdowns and some of the battles consist of your basic wire-fu, with people performing super human feet such as jumping up to 30 feet or so. There is also some variety in the weapons, so not all of the characters are using swords. Some of them attack by using throwing darts, and there's even a little hand to hand action.

At times the combatants are also women whom are wielding daggers, and one uses a long scarf to ensnare the heroes. There are also some good moments of acrobatics and decent stunts here and there. Although it isn't really over the top, the gore is plenty and it mainly consists of blood running from someone's mouth or very bad slashes.

Production values are pretty high, even though I do think some older Shaw Brothers films are quite better. The special effects are primitive by todays standards but I guess they get the job done. I think the set pieces are pretty good, and some of the battles take place in small buildings, as well as restaurants with the right amount of lighting being used, and this also goes for the darker segments.

I don't recall any type of background music for the action scenes, but the lack of music made them no less entertaining I think. The sound effects are the over-exaggerated yet hilarious blows that we all know and love. Despite the small misses in translations, the English dub really isn't that bad. In addition, the sub is very good because the words hang around a little while even for the slowest reader to catch, to include they're in big white words that are very easy to see. The picture on this particular 2008 release is very good with no grain to it. Outside of the somewhat bad editing once in awhile, there's really nothing to complain about.

Fu is pretty much the only one whom is developed, while a majority of the cast are present to fill their roles. The viewer gets to know the calm and deadly Fu whom is constantly aware of his surroundings. He begins as a stoic wanderer focused on his goal. However, through at least one character interaction he shows a different side of himself; but the biggest attraction happens to be his sword, which appears to be a blend of a thick machete and a night stick, that he sometimes twirls around during his quick paced battles.

The plot begins to develop when the mysterious Master Yu's motive is made clear. Both sides are after a deadly weapon called the Peacock Dart which is said to be very powerful, and the viewer is treated to displays of its power. Even though the story is very straight forward, there are plot twist added to enhance the story. Most of them are very easy to predict but I don't think they damage the overall story.

The acting is very good yet I can't really think of any stand outs. This also rings the same for the characters, as they all prove to be competent martial artist. They move with grace and very good form. The women also seemed to hold their own as well, and I don't remember any of them looking sloppy while performing their attacks. Also, the women provide the necessary eye candy and they were quite beautiful in their traditional chinese outfits.

The Magic Blade is a film that won't appeal to everyone that's for sure. Even though I enjoyed the action scenes, I found it to become quite repetitive as the character ran into plot related elements only to engage in more action scenes. Some of the non action segments were a little boring. It was a good thing they didn't last very long though.

At the end of the day, The Magic Blade is for the die hard action fan, whom will more than likely come away feeling his or her time was well spent. Don't come into this searching for anything real deep because you won't find it. The film has a 97 minute run time.
