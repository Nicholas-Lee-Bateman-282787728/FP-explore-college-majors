With that out of the way let proceed to the missleading cover as another review stated Michael Madson is only in this movie fror a very short while as is John Savage the film revolves around a father and son . the father must be uncertain as to what his son's name is as he calls him boy almost the complete film thats when on the odd occasion he calls him Casper. Film start off with boy wanted one of the best set of teeth that i have almost ever seen dad says that its not due to come out for several days how he figures that out is beyond me. They come across a scene , we the viewers are not certain what we are looking at be are assured that for some unknown reason they have all killed each other. In closeing the price that its offered for is far to high even the one cent plus post being offered by sellers is no low enought for you to wste the time to watch this garbage only reason that I watched it was that in Australia I had payed with the low exchange rate and the high rate of postage from the USA and the hope it was not going to get any worse two redeeming features are the opening scene brief that is was of the beautifull countryside and the highlight of the film the closing credits this is a real shocker.

Most of the film is consumed with the relationship of Roger Hazzard(Kirk Harris) and his son Casper Hazzard(Ryan Ballance) as they go prospecting in California in 1871 following the death of the mother (Yvonne Delarosa). Roger has some mental issues that get worse as the film progresses. There is mention of a bad guy known as ""Father Bill"" who robs and sometimes kills prospectors of their gold. Symbolically, Casper finds himself between a rock and a hard place as he climbs toward the freedom of the light.

The film moves slow. The dialogue has religious overtones but is not really developed, i.e. written by someone who has heard about the Bible, but never read it. Native Americans are referred to as ""Redskins"" and can't tell the difference between a man coming out of a cave and an earth spirit.

This production is far from ""action packed"" and being a ""thriller.""

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. One SOB. Not much in violence that commands an ""R"" rating.  Originally released under the title ""The Sorrow"" which was as about as meaningful as the current title. How about ""Hazzards in the Mountains?""",1368230400,5,1384,4.7740585774058575
