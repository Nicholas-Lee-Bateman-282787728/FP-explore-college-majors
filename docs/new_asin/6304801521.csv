The characters are sweet, the storyline is engaging, there's a lesson to learn and always a happy ending.",1288656000,,266,4.911111111111111
7877295,5,6304801521,"Our family loves this whole series.  Though there are some continuity problems, little kids don't notice this part.  Both my 5 year  old and toddler love Huckle and his friends and ask to watch the shows over and over.  This story with the history of a tradition, we felt was not only fun but educational.  The animation is also top-notch, as are most of the programs from CINAR.",1069372800,2,379,4.514705882352941
7877296,1,6304801521,"If you loved Best Busypeople, Best Learning Songs, Best Counting, Best ABC, & Best Mother Goose, you will hate this as much as I my son and I did. Terrible sound quality, a story that takes place 1,000 years ago in  Bohemia with accents so thick you cannot understand what the characters are  saying. The other two stories are strange; one is about the  ""reality"" of the Easter Bunny (those that would enjoy this would  not even entertain the thought) and the final story finds Huckle taking  care of a family of lost baby birds. He sneaks them into his room and lies  to his parents when they walk in after hearing the birds! Each story is  broken up by what are called ""music interstitials"" aka music  videos featuring Huckle and the gang either rapping or rocking out to heavy  metal. It is truly unbelievable - and sickening - to watch. This, along  with the other Cinar/ Polygram Videos (which I think were produced after  Richard Scarry's death in 1994)are not worth the bother, and are more than  disappointing.",948326400,20,1018,4.625698324022347
