8465577,1,B005CKI7LM,"Ridiculous, shameless propaganda that was loaded with generalities and the same inflated, vague statistics used by today's media  machine (apparently- Ephedra was still legally sold in medications OTC when this was released!) to 'educate' the public and raise 'awareness' for the sheeple that are easily influenced by such garbage. As if that young black kid ever committed an ARMED ROBBERY while high on Sudafed! Really, Now...? Did he teach pigs to fly too?",1419897600,,459,5.287671232876712
8465578,5,B005CKI7LM,"A very good way of bringing awareness to the viewing public on how easy accesses our children have in getting drugs. The sadness of it is that our children's justification is that either the doctor prescribed it or these can be purchased over the counter, so this is their way of justifying getting high on the drugs. It's like thier ""safety net"" if you will.",1410652800,,359,4.538461538461538
8465579,5,B005CKI7LM,The second program of new dimension I've seen and I really like the way they present information! Very good program to watch!,1399593600,,125,4.7272727272727275
8465580,1,B005CKI7LM,The film is too general.  Few details are provided.  It might be OK for a middle school class but is useless above that level.,1347062400,2,126,4.208333333333333
