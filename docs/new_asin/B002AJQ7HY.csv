8359523,4,B002AJQ7HY,"This documentary is valuable insofar as it does a good job of informing the viewer about a 20th century Tibetan intellectual named Gendun Chophel, who began his life as a monastic but rebelled against rigidity and stagnation in Tibetan Buddhist and Tibetan political institutions as they existed  just prior to the invasion of Tibet in 1949 by Chinese communists. As a monk he was reputed to be unsurpassed in debate, yet one wonders how someone so well-versed in the teachings of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni and those followed could so ignore those teachings (especially those on renunciation of worldly pleasures). Yet it took such an ""errant"" monk to expose the corruption and hypocrisy that apparently pervaded the very closed Tibetan political system prior to it's ""liberation"" by Mao Zedong and his People's Army. Chophel was obviously an important figure in 20th century Tibet.",1440028800,,889,5.216783216783217

However, it's been a while since I looked at it, and so I can't give you specifics. I remember that I was impressed.",1385510400,,253,4.644444444444445
8359525,3,B002AJQ7HY,"Oh know not another movie on Tibet. I could only do 45 minutes before I feel a sleep. It seemed to be 2 movies in one .Movie one is about a monk which if you add it up is about 5 minutes . The other is about  china taking over Tibet and Tibet's as it is now. One thing you never here about is Tibetans in china killing chines which they did way before china occupied Tibet But who's counting.  If  one went  back far enough you would see that every culture was at one time a slave and at other times a  oppressor of some other culture. Even in Tibet there is the Bon much like Witchcraft, pagans and native Indian religion in the US and of other parts of the world .You might think differently about Tibet Buddhism if you were raised Bon .
it is important to know that's what man dose Takes over by what ever way possible whether thru pen or sword . And so with this understanding it would I think if the movie told about a monk and less of who did what to who .If your going to talk about China they should also talk about what Tibet did to China too. Nothing is pure not even Buddhism .Its only how you look at it kids or don't*
  I gave it some stars for its over all ness  but too sleepy some tits would be nice",1358812800,,1215,3.9508196721311477
8359526,5,B002AJQ7HY,What appealed to me about the CD's topic was that it wasn't just the Buddhist philosophy but insight into disenchantment with the thinking and lifestyle in general.  I felt it was helpful to see what could make someone become disenchanted with such a wonderful way of living life.  After watching this CD I feel that I am right on tract in pursing a Buddhist way of life.  Good for the opposite point of view.,1299283200,5,409,4.5
8359527,5,B002AJQ7HY,"An overlooked corner of modern Tibetan history is revealed in Luc Schaedler's Angry Monk, the fascinating story of Gendun Choephel, regarded now as one of Tibet's leading intellectuals of the 20th century but once reviled and imprisoned for daring to dream of a society open to democratic development.

Disillusioned with a culture that worshiped tradition and feared innovation, Choephel left the stifling regimen of monastic life in 1934 in the company of Rahul Sankrityayan, an Indian scholar of Buddhism and communist activist for Indian independence. Traveling to India, Choephel stepped into a world of wonders, a land criss-crossed by trains, peopled with merchants and businessmen engaged in trade with the outside world, and united in throwing off British imperialism. Enraptured and eager to experience it all, Choephel shrugged off his monastic habits and began an inner exploration of sensual pleasure through tobacco, alcohol and women. All the while he was writing in his diary, painting, sketching, completing the first ever Tibetan translation of the Kama Sutra, publishing a pilgrim's guide to the sacred Buddhist sites of India, contributing reports on the outside world to an emigre newspaper, and beginning work on a non-religious history of Tibet.

Arriving back in Lhasa, Choephel found his reputation had preceded him and was promptly thrown into jail, tortured, and left to rot until being released only months before the Chinese invasion of 1950. With any hope for reform crushed by the arrival of Mao's army, Choephel entered an intense period of inebriation from which he never recovered, passing away in 1951 at the age of 48.

Swiss director Schaedler works matter-of-factly, tracing the travels of his subject from his birthplace in eastern Tibet through to India and back to Lhasa, weaving together interviews with Choephel's surviving contemporaries with voice-overs describing his own journey. Anyone interested in modern Tibetan history should not miss this film, especially as it is the only document about Choephel's life currently available in English.

The film is also available on DVD direct from the director's website.",1263340800,13,2160,5.419642857142857
8359528,5,B002AJQ7HY,"Gendun Choephel was a true Mahatma and visionary ahead of its time. This film reflects on his mystical explorations, daring travels, and spiritual challenges. The documentary is superb, yet fails to demonstrate how the Communist Chinese unjustly assassinated hundreds of thousands of innocent Monks while forcing them to perform inhumane atrocities!! Where is the UN and the Vatican on this?

Unfortunately, Tibet will never be free again as the US and Britain failed to assist the spiritual center of the world during their turmoil invasion. Forthe record, this marvelous nation is also known as Shangri-La. Sadly, the US has now entered into a ""Covenant with the Enemy"" Chinese nation and this harm will bring due Karma at its destine time...",1261440000,3,744,5.2
