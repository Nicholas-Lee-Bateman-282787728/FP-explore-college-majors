See, while the art was pretty, I just couldn't bring myself to like any of the characters. I can't explain it--there just wasn't any magic there. There were all just standing around, trying to decide what to do, rather than taking any form of action. Some of their voices annoyed me as well.
All in all, I recommend that everyone watch this at least once. Maybe you'll like it better than I did.",1080172800,,620,4.048780487804878
7949021,5,B00005OLB4,"I have only seen El Hazard OAV and El Hazard II and I figured that I would like this one also (the wanderers) and boy was I right!!  I love it!!  At the end of every episode, there is always something going on or something said that will just make you bust out laughing!  Also 7 episodes on 1 dvd (175min worth) is a great deal for under 30 dollars.  Try getting that for Evangelion or Ranma 1/2.  Impossible!
For an anime that is funny throughout and have very likable characters, the Wanderers is a good value!",1012867200,,512,4.237113402061856
7949022,4,B00005OLB4,"This series is the TV remake of the Magnificent World OAV set. The Wanderers takes a differant turn in the beginning by having Jinnai Sabotage Makoto's machine thus sending the cast to El Hazard. In addition to the opening story change, they changed the personality of Iferita, and created a love interrest between Mikoto and the princess. The other major change is the deletion of the princesses sister who makes up some of the funniest moments of the OAV set. Also one major note, the Alternate world set takes place based on the Magnificent World set and not the Wanderers. This set is good to get only to see the alternate version of how it started, but is worth it, for its own merit.",1003017600,3,689,4.564516129032258
