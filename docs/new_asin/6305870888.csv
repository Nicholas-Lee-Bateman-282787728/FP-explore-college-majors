7896466,3,6305870888,Been watching many volumes of the Twilight Zone recently. Bought a couple sets recently including this one. The episodes are average so buy other volumes first.,1493337600,,160,5.1923076923076925
7896467,2,6305870888,"""Twilight Zone"" is my all time favorite TV show. I love or at least strongly like most of the episodes from the series. I have been writing reviews here on Amazon on the different volumes in the DVD series of the ""Twilight Zone"". Volume 27 quite possibly is my least favorite from the series of DVDs. The stories are OK but I don't find them all that interesting.

First story on the disc is ""He's Alive"". Starring Dennis Hopper he plays a young man with fascist ideals. His aim is to spread his beliefs to everyone who will listen to him. But even with help from the few followers he has most people see him as a racist nut case. Then a mysterious figure appears and starts giving advice to Hopper what he needs to do to get his message out. This is an hour long episode from the fourth season. The story itself isn't too bad and Dennis Hopper gives a very good performance but the plot is a little bit predictive and drags. This might have been a better story if it was only a half hour in length.

Next up is ""From Agnes -- With love"". This is one of the few comedy episodes starring Wally Cox, best known as one of the celebrities who appeared regularly on ""Hollywood Squares"". Some others may remember him as the voice of Underdog on the cartoon series of the same name. This however is one comedic story the ""Zone"" could have done without. In it Cox plays a computer programmer in charge of the worlds most powerful computer. A problem has occurred however that Cox is not aware of. Working day in and day out with the computer apparently has developed human emotions for ""Agnes"" and she has fallen in love with Wally. He is not aware of that nor that Agnes is trying to sabotage any chance he is trying to make to get to know a young last who works in the same building. Wally Cox was a great comedic actor but this episode just doesn't work. At least not for me.

Last on the DVD is ""Spur Of The Moment"". A young last, played by Diana Hyland, is out riding her horse when she sees a figure dressed in black chasing her in horseback. Hyland gets away but wants to know who is following her. The figure she sees is herself in the future and her future self is trying to tell her something. Will she listen however?

For anyone not familiar with ""Twilight Zone"" and looking for some volumes to get from that show skip this volume. There are a lot better volumes out there, like volumes 2 or 3 just to name a couple, that would make better introductions to the series. For the serious fan like myself you will want to add this disc to your collection just so you can complete having all the volumes but I would bet you won't watch this volume all that much.",1407369600,,2661,4.273809523809524

7896469,5,6305870888,"I guess I must be biased but I have always believed ""Twilight Zone"" to be one of the best, if not the best, TV series ever. The ones in this collection are all great. Thanks.",1319500800,,174,4.0
7896470,5,6305870888,"I primarily purchased this volume for the ""He's Alive"" episode starring a young Dennis Hopper.  I believe Rod Serling himself penned this tale warning a post-WWII world that hatred, bigotry, and prejudice were still ""alive-and-well"" even after the defeat of the Nazis and prosecutions at Nuremburg.  I highly recommend it for educational discussions regarding prejudice and racism.",1307836800,,381,5.666666666666667
7896471,2,6305870888,"I purchased this to show to a group of friends.  The first part was too long, so we saw the second part and it was fine.  Tried to show the 3rd part and it was garbled as to sound and picture.  It was unusable",1300406400,,209,3.7045454545454546
7896472,5,6305870888,"`HE'S ALIVE' is a good study of Fascism and Nazism and how it can affect an essential weak individual who carries strong inner hatreds which are probably aimed at himself but manifests that hatred towards others aided by the vision of Adolph Hitler. Denis Hopper is excellent as the figure with a spine of clay that elicits advice from his vision of Hitler played by Curt Conway. The choice of Conway was criticized for his lack of resemblance to Hitler. However, Conway's performance was right on target full of energy and conviction. He had Hitler's gestures down to a science. This is a very interesting episode written by Rod Serling and often overlooked. Vividly photographed. It fit the hour-long format perfectly.  `SPUR OF THE MOMENT' contains some very frightening images filmed in broad daylight. The sight of a pursuing Diana Hyland on horseback dressed in flowing black are Freudian in nature and remain indelible to the viewer. Freely written by Richard Matheson but one of the most visually effective episodes.  `FROM AGNES - WITH LOVE' is a lightweight episode but very appropriate for Wally Cox. You either like this one or you don't. Written by Barney Scofield and directed by Dick Donner! It was enjoyable to see so many actors from 1960's television on this DVD such as Wally Cox, Ralph Taeger, Dennis Hopper, Diana Hyland and Roger Davis.",982108800,9,1358,4.925764192139738
7896473,3,6305870888,"These DVD features one the best episodes in the series and one of my personal favorites: ""He's alive"". It stars a 27 year old Dennis Hopper in a very interesting role: a young fascist emulating Hitler.  Hopper's performance really shows things to come in his career, and the  story written by creator Rod Serling is -tragically so- scary, and most of  all a sad reality still among us... Two more episodes are included.",962928000,6,419,4.712328767123288
