8060497,5,B0009GX2FK,"Acclaimed USA documentary film maker Arthur Dong has released his first DVD project - a 3 disc boxed collection under the significant title ""Stories from the War on Homo Sexuality"", comprising three feature length films ""Coming Out Under Fire"" (1994), ""Licensed To Kill"" (1997) and ""Family Fundamentals"" (2002). All are digitally remastered and include added features, extended scenes, music selections and detailed liner notes. The films deal respectively with: gays and lesbians who served in World War 2; the convicted killers of gay men; and families in which openly gay and lesbian children have parents who campaign actively against homosexuality.

""Stories from the War on Homosexuality"" is a highly accessible, powerful and empowering resource for anyone working toward social reform and LGBT acceptance. Great value lies not only in the high quality of craftsmanship, but also in the entertaining and compelling presentation and the respect and compassion with which Arthur treats all of his contributors.

""Stories from the War on Homosexuality"" gives us a detailed perspective on the experiential gap between how we view ourselves and how others may see us. Young people need to know that homosexuals do have an ongoing and integral role in society...and older persons need to know that we can't afford to rest on our laurels.",1193961600,12,1337,5.331753554502369
