8756498,5,B01DO9K0XA,"This is another one of the great courses from the Teaching Company. I love these courses because they make the knowledge of some of America's top professors so accessible to the general public. This course on medical school grand rounds is particularly interesting for people who want to learn a little bit more about the medical profession without getting too deeply into its technical aspects. The material in this course is very accessible, and I (who don't have any formal medical training) was able to learn from it without much difficulty. Definitely recommended.",1464739200,,569,5.129032258064516
8756499,5,B01DO9K0XA,"I purchased this book/dvd combo for a friend in pediatric practicums for a practitioner's certification.  He was very impressed with the selection of cases and the simplicity of the information.  As a student, he found it an excellent source for considering differential diagnoses.  The DVD is an excellent accompaniment to the book.  Note that the book has a free access code to download the entire text on a smartphone or tablet.  Based on his feedback, this is a great product for a student.",1463011200,,494,4.903614457831325
8756500,5,B01DO9K0XA,"As a stay at home mom, with her first child, I have felt the need to constantly go to the doctor over every little thing. Even though I have done that in the past, my daughter has consistently been sick. There have been two separate instances where it took months in one case and years in the other to get the correct diagnoses for her. As a mom, I just want to learn how to see the signs doctors can miss, since they are not with my girl as much as I am. Great courses has been an amazing way to better myself without even having to leave the house. I am so thankful to have a means of learning that is this user friendly, and I can not wait to delve into it further. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",1463011200,,741,4.013513513513513
