It holds their attention, and is also great for group discussions, increasing social skills. Young children become fascinated through a fun learning experience. Educational, and highly recommended!",1458086400,,340,6.25531914893617
8488641,5,B005XH26YS,I use this video for my first grade class during rainy recess days.  I like to put in something educational when they have to stay indoors.  The kids love the African animal footage.  It relaxes and entertains them and the best part is they walk away learning some new Spanish vocabulary.,1412899200,2,288,4.607843137254902

8488643,4,B005XH26YS,"I used this in my Spanish class (high school) to introduce them to animals before we began the unit.  It is not challenging, but it was a fun way to start.  Gave them a worksheet to write down the names of the animals and some important words.",1370390400,4,243,4.148936170212766
8488644,5,B005XH26YS,"I absolutely love this video.  The spanish is simple and applicable. It covers very useful vocabulary.  I love that it's entirely in spanish and isn't translated, but the way that it's presented it doesn't need to be.  One of the best features is that it will dim part of the screen so that if it's saying ""nose"" then the nose is highlighted.  A great learning tool.  We'll be buying more in this series.",1323302400,10,404,4.47945205479452
