4315101,5,B004BBHVHO,"I have watched both (Astro) Turf Wars and the updated version The Billionaires Tea Party and BOTH of them are excellent! They tell the true story of how the top 1% of America's richest companies & residents create and use fake front groups to subvert our government and as many disinformed people as they possibly can to get what they want. These are must watch documentaries if you want to know how our country has been bought, paid for and controlled by a very small group of people who hide behind citizens that they convince to do their filthy work for them. Watch and wake up, it's past time to know what is really happening!",1303257600,14,630,4.48695652173913
4315102,5,B004BBHVHO,I wish more people would watch this movie and understand the persuasiveness of special interest groups. It's truly a bit frightening.,1302480000,,133,5.380952380952381
4315103,5,B004BBHVHO,"The Koch brothers' bankrolling of Tea Party candidates is as active as ever; their intrusion into Wisconsin politics led to the election of the most abhorrent governor the state has known, and they're now funding attack ads against the less partisan of the two state supreme court justices.  The best and perhaps only way to battle the Koch propaganda is to educate.  We're living a country with a failed media system; documentaries like (Astro) Turf Wars are critical viewing to help balance the misinformation.",1301875200,10,512,5.083333333333333
4315104,5,B004BBHVHO,"It's about time the truth about the TP was told. Most of these hard working American TP members have been fooled into thinking this a real ""grass roots"" movement when nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is that middle class Americans have been convinced to vote against their own best interests and have been turned against their own friends, neighbors and family members by the billioniare corporate interests that fund the TEA Party.

Railroad baron Jay Gould once stated: ""I can hire one half of the working class to kill the other half."" Jay Gould is long dead, but the Koch brothers have picked up his standard, pitting one middle class family against another in the interest of the billionaire and millionaire class.

Sadly, too many Americans have the ""Lottery Mentality"" in that they support the lower taxation of the billionaire class because they believe they will somehow win the ""success lottery"" just like so many millions of Americans buying lottery tickets believe they will be that one-in-fifty-million ""everyman"" that becomes the next Bill Gates.",1301011200,9,1078,5.050561797752809
4315105,5,B004BBHVHO,"This is one of those documentaries, like food inc., that every American citizen should watch. It exposes the methods and practices of corporate politics. When the viewer see those practices first hand, he can start developing a healthy skepticism and self resistance to those brainwash technics.

Everyone knows that money plays a big role in US politics. I knew that too. But after watching AstroTurf wars, I'm starting to realize how big.

I also loved the simple & naive style of the movie and the subtle humor.

Watch it and tell your friends about it. This is the kind of film that commercial media wouldn't be eager to promote, as it targets some of their REAL customers - their advertisers. Only people like me and you who may actually care about the future of our kids can spread the word about this very important film. So let's do that.",1291680000,25,846,4.6644295302013425
8421848,5,B004BBHVHO,I have seen a huge change in ameriucn society but I never realized how influenced the peons of certain parties can be by their corporate masters. Truly an excellent film done by a non-biased Australian that encountered tremendous obstacles to get the inforation conveyed.,1379980800,,271,5.181818181818182
8421849,5,B004BBHVHO,"This should be required viewing for every American. Exposes the power and money behind the Tea Party and how the membership is being manipulated by powerful corporate interests. Makes it clear that if you go to a Tea Party rally, you are doing the bidding of big oil, the insurance industry and others who do not care about your liberty- they only care about their profits. Watch with an open mind.",1379721600,,398,4.619718309859155
8421850,5,B004BBHVHO,"The film exposes the professional enabling of the Tea Party by agents of Billionaire David Koch. It shows Dick Armey speaking with Republican House members flanking him and David Koch speaking at a convention of conservatives for budget cutting; also obviously professionaly painted tour buses, pavillion tents, signs.",1362268800,,318,5.645833333333333
8421851,5,B004BBHVHO,"If people only knew how they are being manipulated, they would be appalled.  This documentary tells it like it is.",1359417600,,114,4.7
8421852,4,B004BBHVHO,"right away you get a brief interview with a Kentucky Tea Party organizer (a young patriotic woman) who is calm and collected in why she is involved. I enjoyed this doc. for it's exposure of peacful protests, ofcourse the producers are biased but i expected that. Same guys behind this film back the left, and other movements and organizations that are against Capitalism and right wing movements. So for those of us in the middle atleast you can think for yourself by the end of it.",1355702400,,482,4.616279069767442
8421853,5,B004BBHVHO,We watched this movie online the first time.  This is very well done and provides a concise view of the influence of corporations in our political lives.  We are trying to buy DVDs for friends who all say they want to see it.,1354579200,,225,4.209302325581396
8421854,5,B004BBHVHO,This video was very informative. It explains a lot about the political events that have been happening in this country. Every American should see this.,1353888000,,151,5.08
8421855,1,B004BBHVHO,"Watching movies like this reminds me a lot of people of different religions critiquing other peoples' religions. They THINK they understand what is going on, but they just don't. I watched this movie in an attempt to understand the mindset of the people I disagree with politically. I wouldn't say the documentary is complete rubbish, but the makers of the film are playing up some things while completely disregarding others.

First of all, let me explain how the tea party started. It did not spontaneously start after Rick Santelli's rant on CNBS. That is not what happened. Allow me to explain as someone who's been in the Tea Party since its inception. As everyone knows, when a new president comes into office, they attempt to use the early part of their presidency to get as much of their agenda passed into law as possible. Obama was no different in this goal, but the scope of the changes he was trying to make were much larger than previous presidents. From massive stimulus to cap and trade, health care reform, and immigration reform, even the most ardent Democrats should be able to admit that Obama's agenda was fairly aggressive.

Knowing that Republicans did not have the legislative power to stop the Obama agenda, people on the right were pretty reasonably frustrated. What did Democrats and the left expect us to do? I would like to point out that besides the Obama agenda being publicly pushed, all kinds of other crazy ideas like mortgage debt forgiveness and a national sales tax were being floated around. While Rush Limbaugh repeatedly denies that he started the Tea Party, it was him who repeatedly and often advised his listeners to get out to town hall meetings and let their congressman know they were diametrically opposed to the ACA.

That is how the Tea Party started. I fail to see how corporate America or the Koch brothers manufactured the movement. When you have a mass movement, existing groups who support what that movement is doing are going try to organize it to ensure that the movement is effective. That is not only common sense, but claiming the groups who moved in created the movement to begin with is just dumb.

The Tea Party is the logical response to 50% of the country trying to impose its views on 100% of the country. If you look at what the typical conservative believes in, you'll see they really aren't attempting to impose their views on people at the federal level since we believe in federalism. So in the conservative utopia, the people in the states determine the proper level of government. To people who think that way, federal dictates are insufferable. In that light, the tea party is the LOGICAL response. There is no conspiracy.",1351555200,,2695,4.776824034334764
8421856,5,B004BBHVHO,"Especially shocked about the filming in Pittsburgh PA. I think it was downplayed here, because I never saw THAT on the local news! 1984?",1338940800,,136,4.708333333333333
8421857,1,B004BBHVHO,"As someone who attended the rally in DC on 9-12-2009 and as someone who is quite tired of the propaganda thrown around by the establishment in Govt, it doesn't surprise me how the mantra of astro turf gets thrown around like ""projection"" onto the truly grassroots uprising of individuals when the actual manufactured movement called Occupy Wall Street is described in the media as some spontanious movement.
History will be told by the victors. Let us hope sanity and reason prevail.",1324512000,,483,4.9753086419753085
