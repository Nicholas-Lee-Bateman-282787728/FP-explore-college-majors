In the book, the heroine, Andy, gets fed up with Miranda, the boss from hell and then some, and tells Bossy Boots off in a well-deserved, profanity-laden tirade in Paris. She goes back to New York, where she loses her boyfriend because of her job, sells all the clothes she got from the job and gets $40,000, and finds another boyfriend.

In the movie, Miranda winds up being this vulnerable, sympathetic character after she loses her job in a corporate takeover Andy doesn't think Miranda knows about, but Miranda does, and her husband divorces her. Andy also gets involved with a guy who, as it turns out, is commandeering Miranda's ouster. So if the ouster never happened in the book, then she never dated this character, because he wasn't in the book.

Miranda's top assistant, Emily, who hates Andy, gets hit by a car - which isn't in the book. Andy also ends up giving all her new clothes to a grateful Emily. Didn't happen.

And finally, Andy and her estranged boyfriend work things out.

Oh, and Miranda gives Andy a good job reference.

HUH??

Did the producers even BOTHER reading the book??

I don't mind minor differences, and I know about creative license. But I was aghast watching this movie.

And the movie just never seemed to take off. It didn't get off the ground. It was dull and irritating most of the time.

It deserved a Razzie award. Bad. Very bad. What a waste of acting talent.",1491696000,,1541,4.615384615384615
