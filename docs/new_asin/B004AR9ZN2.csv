8420757,4,B004AR9ZN2,"The first 1/2 of this DVD is WW2 documentary about the infamous ""Memphis Belle"" B-17. It's in color, actual footage from the war, directed by William Wyler. The narrator sounds like Lee Marvin (it's not) & is interesting. Dated, yes, made to shore up civilian morale at a time when surviving 25 missions was rare. After the 25th mission, the crew returned back to the US to raise war bonds.

The part I enjoyed the most was listening to the vets discussing missions - the routine from wake up, chow, briefing, forming up (extensive & complicated process which you don't always get to read about in books) the missions. What was scary to some (fighters when the Luftwaffe still had planes) and later the flak. Guys that were busy did not have time to think much - the difference between a bombardier and togglier - subtle, but different. The deception plans, attempts to fake out German defenses - complicated.

And of course, the planes. Seeing massive formations of B-17's, trying to imagine what it would be like to see 1,000 of them taking off from all of those bases in England, flying over Europe, the vast distances at 25,000 feet. I don't think it's something you'd watch over and over again, but I did enjoy it and learned a lot of the small details that books don't usually get into. Serious buffs of B-17's , aviation, war bird lovers would enjoy this.",1313712000,,1362,4.62396694214876
