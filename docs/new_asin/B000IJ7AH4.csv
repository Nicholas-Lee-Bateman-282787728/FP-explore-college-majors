8145710,1,B000IJ7AH4,"I have either watched or owned four versions of ""Love Affair"". This one is BY FAR the worse ever produced. The film jumps in many places and the sound is imperfect. It was so bad that I stopped watching about 1/2 way through. I recommendation to anyone is to NOT buy this horrible version of ""Love Affair"". One really odd thing about the cover is the leads are not named. Four people who hold minor roles in ""Love Affair"" are listed. In addition, no mention is made of any of the actors in ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"". I did not watch ""The Last Time I Saw Paris"" and can not say anything about that. If you want that film I would suggest that you buy it on a DVD not produced by Marengo Films.",1205107200,6,693,4.102941176470588
8145711,5,B000IJ7AH4,Marengo Films is proud to announce the release of these two fine movies. The Last Time I Saw Paris is a beautiful Technicolor print. We put it through a scene for scene color correction and sound design and believe it is the finest print of this film on the market. Love Affair - an older print - is slightly soft - however Marengo put it through a complete scene for scene color correction and sound design and believe it too is the finest print of this movie on the market.,1165881600,5,475,4.288888888888889
