4710857,5,B005J47QQ8,"Been to the Mideast and Eastern Europe?  This is your chance to get the raw experience of both.  Read books about existentialism, socialism and marxism?  Here's a taste of their history and influence on modern life.  The ""Human Resources Manager"" works on many subtle levels, there isn't a lot of dialogue and it's certainly not talky like American films. Between spare dialogue and meaningful conversation combined with what is framed in a lens, a powerful story is told that crosses incomes, race, religion, politics, borders, into the spirit and soul of mans' search for meaning in the face of human folly causing tragedy.  The authors offer no simplistic answers to human pain except to keep living and loving one another.",1357603200,,726,5.016666666666667

4710859,3,B005J47QQ8,"This is clearly a 3+ Star foreign film based on the originality of plot, quality of acting. mood/ambience, exotic foreign locales, and social message, etc. However, the enjoyment level is severely compromised, since the English subtitles inexplicably vanish for long stretches of dialogue.  I've noticed this phenomenon in other Israeli films as well, and it is a serious disservice to the hearing-challenged community.",1344297600,,419,5.650793650793651
4710860,4,B005J47QQ8,"This movie is an overlap on a personal Venn Diagram for me.  I read and enjoyed A. B. Yehoshua's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Woman-in-Jerusalem/dp/0156031949/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Woman in Jerusalem</a>, the novel upon which this movie is based.  And, I'm a big consumer of Israeli movies with a great liking for the works of Eran Riklis (director of this film) and his compatriot, Eytan Fox.  Riklis directed the excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lemon-Tree/dp/B004GL6ZXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lemon Tree</a>. But it's his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Syrian-Bride/dp/B000EHQ7JC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Syrian Bride</a>&nbsp;that is among the best films ever made in my opinion (and, since I mentioned Fox, I'll add that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Walk-on-Water/dp/B0009YVBGO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Walk on Water</a>&nbsp;is arguably my #1 movie if I was forced to choose).

'The Human Resources Manager' - while a faithful adaptation of the book - isn't up to the stirring heights of the two previous Riklis works I've noted above.  It's a nice, small movie but - like the tank the protagonists procure to tread slowly through a nameless ex-Soviet republic - the action never moves out of its heavy, low gear.

That's not to say this isn't a film worth watching.  I really like the way Riklis shows the slowly developing relationship between The HR Manager (Mark Ivanir) and The Boy (Noah Silver).  [No one has names here - we have The Divorcee, The Widow, The Weasel (the reporter).]

And, I love how Riklis allows Ivanir to slowly warm to his task.  He thinks at first that he's set up to be the fall guy (a woman dies in one of the suicide bombings that swept Israel in those days, no one claims the body, The Weasel pins the callousness on the bakery where she toiled namelessly, the HR - picture and all - gets the tabloid treatment).  But, slowly, Ivanir goes from railing at the absurdity and pointlessness of the task to getting into the spirit and duty of a mission.  The difference? Learning about who she was, who her family was, her selfless move to Jerusalem to better their situation.

Of note, is the dynamic between Ivanir and Silver.  The Boy is abandoned and feral when we first meet him.  But there's a tender personality in there wanting to be loved.  By the end of the film, it's clear he's touched The HR Manager.  Words spoken between the two at the end make clear that the relationship will go on from here.",1339372800,4,2654,5.729591836734694
4710861,4,B005J47QQ8,"Let me state upfront that I am a big fan of Film Movement, which releases foreign and indie movies to the US on DVD which otherwise would never get a chance to find an audience here.

""The Human Resources Manager"" (2010 release from Israel; 103 min.) is a rather strange, but ultimately appealing movie. The initial story line, set in Jerusalem 2002, centers on the fact that a female employee of a big bakery, working in Israel as a ""guest worker"" from Romania, died in one of the many suicide attacks that terrorized Israel at the time. Turns out that the woman had been let go from the bakery some weeks before that, without the bakery's top management knowing about it. An Israeli reporter turns the story into one of ""inhuman indifference"" and the company's HR manager is asked to look into it. At that point it looked like the movie might have a political take on the suicide bombings. Eventually, the company decides to pay for taking the woman's body back to Romania for a proper funeral. The movie then takes a compltely different take, and it becomes a road movie on how the woman's body is eventually taken back to the village of her mother, deep into off the beaten track in Romania. I don't want to spoil how it all plays out, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

As strange as this movie was, I found myself somehow mesmorized as it kept developing. I picked this up, literally knowing nothing about it, but the ""Film Movement"" stamp of approval was good enough for me, and I was once again rewarded. Beware, this is MILES away from your standard Hollywood fare, but if you are into foreign movies and like to take a chance on some unheard of movie, I readily recommend this. You know who you are.",1335398400,9,1716,4.496794871794871
4710862,4,B005J47QQ8,"A Human Resource manager, only known to us by title, is pressured to deal with the death of a  woman who worked at the large industrial bakery.  Yulia Petracke, employed in the cleaning department is dead, and the victim of a suicide bomber in Jerusalem.  And, the newspaper is intent on breaking the story how an employee can be dead for over a week in the morgue, and nobody from the company knows about it.

The H.R. Manager, with his own personal problems at home, divorced and with a daughter he doesn't spend much time with, is sent to make amends to the family and  travels to Romania with the body, for burial.  The newspaper reporter/photographer eager for the negativity for the story, makes the trip along with the dead woman's ex-husband.  They soon reach the woman's 13 year old son, in all his bitterness and anger.  The brown casket sits atop the traveling van.  The journey has its catastrophes.

Billed as a tragicomedy or perhaps even black comedy, but you will not see much of anything deemed as humorous.  The mood is here, the sadness, the lack of compassion.  The viewer experiencess a cold feeling of how a woman can slip through the cracks through employment with the callous company who doesn't even know she is gone.  You will learn from her supervisor how this happened.

When the Human Resource Manager takes that journey for her hometown burial, we see a side of him that changes; his experiences differ, he appreciates his homelife as he travels with the dead woman.  And most important, he gains new perspectives about humans, etc.

There are no character names in the film, and the characters are only known as their title, or son, grandmother, daughter, newspaper reporter, driver, etc., etc.  This brings the dead girl as the focus of a moving, sad drama of an unknown woman.

Some people may not see the emotional aspect of the film, but it is there, developing slowly and giving the viewer a chance to feel the moods, sense the anxiety and unknown, and to gain insight into life's experiences and changes through unfortunate results.

The landscape is stark and cold, music fitting the moods.  Subtitles are yellow, large and clear.  Often, you will hear English spoke throughout the film.

As always, with Film Movement comes a Short Film Of The Month, labeled as a true story, called  Tell Your Children, a five-minute film from Hungary about a woman who is terrorized and assaulted twice by the Nazis.  ... Rizzo",1332806400,4,2451,4.739952718676123
4710863,3,B005J47QQ8,"When a female foreign worker of a national bakery is killed in a suicide bombing, the bakery is accused of indifference and the HR manager is sent to the victim's hometown in Romania to make amends. The HRM is estranged from his wife and young daughter due to his emotional remoteness. This is a quirky, low key movie that chronicles the HR manager and the people he meets on his trip. As the trip progresses, the HRM slowly acquires empathy and thereby regains the love and respect of his family.  There is not a lot of action, but the fellow travelers are colorful and the portrait of life under the Eastern European countries is stark. I enjoyed the movie.",1328486400,6,659,4.53781512605042
4710864,3,B005J47QQ8,This is a very slow-moving adaptation of the A. B. Yehoshua novel which was published in the UK under the title A Woman in Jerusalem. The bleakness of the post-Soviet landscape is beautifully conveyed but the metaphoric level of the book is inevitably lost as it always is in film adapatations of great novels. Still there are funny moments and the humanity of Yehoshua's work does come through.,1316563200,3,395,4.823529411764706

4710873,5,B005J47QQ8,An Israeli human resources manager finds himself very unexpectedly on an extended journey into the hinterlands of the former Soviet empire to return a body so it can be buried in its home country.  The sly humor in the drama and the cast of characters make this film well worth watching.,1374364800,,287,4.627450980392157
4710874,5,B005J47QQ8,"Based on A. B. Yehoshua's novel, ""A Woman in Jerusalem,"" this first rate film adaptation made some changes from the former Soviet Union to Romania. The cast is first rate including Mark Ivanir who played the Human Resources Manager. In this film, names are barely used as is in the novel. They are identified in the cast list as the son, ex-husband, widow, consul, etc. The film begins as her unidentified body lays several days in the Jerusalem morgue. When she is finally identified by her paystub from the bakery, the human resources manager tries to reconcile her death. She was a victim of a suicide bombing. He uncovers a woman he never knew and how her life and death would change his own life.

The human resources manager travels with the body to Romania where he is met by the Israeli consul in Bucharest. There he finds Yulia's ex-husband and son. Her son and minor wants to go to his grandmother, Yulia's mother, but the distance is far and the place is remote. True in the book, Yulia was a Russian Christian immigrant in Jerusalem, Israel while here she is Romanian Christian. The film is a character driven and soul searching for viewers alike. You can't help but watch and relate. You wonder how one person can make a difference even in death to complete strangers.

The quality is first rate on my dvd. There is also a special feature short entitled ""Tell Your Children,"" from Hungary about the Holocaust in a five minute short not to be missed. It would be appropriate for teachers who are teaching holocaust to younger students. Still I was happy to see the book turned into a magnificent movie.",1370649600,4,1614,4.63986013986014
