There was not much damage apparent and not enough to be distracting compared to other movies of this era.  This is a very moralistic story that, depending on one's personal beliefs, might be either inspiring or a bit silly. Gloria Swanson is young and beautiful, although she is made to look pretty beaten down at the lowest point of the narrative. The hand of Cecil B. DeMille is apparent in the polish and high production values throughout.  My only real complaint is the musical soundtrack imposed during the entire length of the movie. Each piece is repeated for a long stretch before it segues into another piece which suffers the same lot. The several songs are then cycled and repeated.  Next time I watch this movie, I will turn off the sound.",1524614400,,833,4.608108108108108
8718412,4,B00YIZWJDO,"I went into this movie very interested, but with pretty low expectations overall. In other words,  I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but I did think I would like it.  And, in that, I was right; and I was even pleasantly surprised along the way.

The story centers on a wealthy, disabled young man named David Markley and the daughter of the town blacksmith, Ruth.  David pays to send Ruth away to a good school, and when she returns three years later, he is struck by the lovely young woman she turned out to be.  Ruth and David make plans to marry, but Ruth meets and eventually falls in love with her father's apprentice, Jim.  Jim is younger, strong and agile, and has full use of his legs, which David does not.  David has a lot of feelings of inferiority regarding his handicap, and he does notice the attraction between Ruth and Jim, but he ultimately pushes these things aside and continues with the marriage plans, all the while believing Ruth still really loves him.  Ruth and Jim run away together to marry, at the anger of her father and the heartbreak of David.  The events that unfold after this are very interesting, rather sad, but also, well....something to think about....

Elliott Dexter (David) and Gloria Swanson (Ruth) give very good performances here, their emotions coming across very well.  Theodore Roberts is also very good as Ruth's father, Luke.  The cast's performances give this story a sensitivity that is not too overly-sentimental, or overdone.  The music score is nothing to write home about, as it is very repetitive, but it is generally appropriate and fits with the feel of what is happening at the time.

This film is from Alpha Video, and their prints vary widely.  I own a few videos from Alpha, and I must say that this is one of their better prints. There is no severe washout or blackout, and there is never a moment when you can't see what is going on.  It is certainly not pristine, but it is quite watchable.

This really was quite a good film.  Love, betrayal, God and Christianity, marriage, and hope and despair are all themes that run throughout.  It is not one of the epics that DeMille is famous for, but it is overall well done, and an enjoyable way to spend some time.",1472601600,5,2222,4.593908629441624
