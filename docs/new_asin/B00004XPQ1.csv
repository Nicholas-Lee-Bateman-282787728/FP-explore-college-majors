1369442,4,B00004XPQ1,I first saw this film on TNT and I liked it immediately.  I thought that the film had a lot of action and suspense which kept me entertained throughout the entire film.  I'm glad that this is being released on video.  I also thought that this film had a great cast.  I thought that their performances were convincing and effective.  I don't think that this film was weak or depressing at all.  I personally enjoyed it and I think that it's worth seeing.,980121600,8,453,4.397590361445783
1369443,4,B00004XPQ1,"This movie did not have much on characterization or a complicated plot, but it was exciting to watch (if you managed to successfully suspend your disbelief). Oh, poor poor daughter of the President! :)",973382400,5,201,4.9411764705882355
1369444,2,B00004XPQ1,"This was lame even for a TV movie.  The best part of the film was the first five minutes showing an assassination attempt on the President of the United States.  After that, the film goes into free fall.
Mariel Hemingway plays a secret service agent who is charged with guarding the President's self-absorbed teenage daughter on an outward-bound type trip of rafting, climbing and living in the wilderness for a week.  The bad-guy militiamen kidnap the brat and all the force at the disposal of the United States is coalesced to rescue her.
The entire story is so contrived and poorly presented that it is laughable.  How lucky that of all the places on earth these militiamen could have gone hunting, they picked the same exact wilderness that the President's daughter was frolicking.  Moreover, it was even more propitious that they happened to have all their high tech surveillance, radio and radar equipment with them while they were bow hunting.
It was also extraordinarily fortunate that Agent McGregor (Hemingway), who had never attempted rock climbing in her life before this trip, was so instantly adept at it that her next climb was a two hundred foot vertical climb without tether.  The ridiculousness they ask us to swallow continues unending.
The action sequences were only fair, and the special effects were a joke.  The music was awful and the film would cut to black for five seconds between certain scenes where the commercials would be placed.  I don't even want to get into the acting.  Dreadful.
Even action junkies will be disappointed by this film.  I rated it a 3/10.  Miss it.",973123200,4,1600,4.867158671586716

7926313,4,B00004XPQ1,"First Daughter, 1999 film

There is a party, Secret Service agents guard the Presidents family. The Presidents daughter wants to go to a club incognito, but she is refused. Outside a sniper tries to get a clear shot at the President. Shots are fired, people scramble for safety. A shooter launches a rocket at a car! The President is taken inside a room. There is more shooting. Helicopters arrive to rescue the President. McGregor is admonished for not following a direct order; she is off the detail. Two days later Federal agents move into an isolated farmhouse in Montana. It has a tunnel to allow the men to escape, but they are caught. Other men escape from another tunnel. The ringleader is caught; he planned the attempted assassination. [Isnt that actor too young to be President?] The President trusts McGregots instincts, and wants her to accompany his daughter on a trip.

This is so great! says daughter Jess. The daughter must wear sunglasses and a hat when in town. McGregor turns down a request to dance from a stranger in a bar. [Does this cause unwanted attention?] The next day they prepare for their rafting trip. The next week will be exciting. They wear flotation vests and a helmet for protection. Rock climbing is next, a safety rope is used. [Practical skills?] Next fishing in the river. The Presidents daughter talks to a to young man. Three hunters observe this group and the guns of the adults! That morning they find Jess is missing! She was with that young man, was getting acquainted, and has an attitude. Those hunters return with rifles. Shots are fired, the adults are hit! A cell phone saved Alex. Three men took Jess. Alex leaves the group, she is joined by Grant, who knows the area. They find an empty abandoned cabin. But Alex steps on something inside! There is an explosion, but they survive. The kidnappers send a video message to the press. They offer to trade Jess for Michael Smith, the leader of these freemen. Can they trace the call? The FBI has records on the kidnappers. Can the kidnappers be trusted?

The first daughter is watched by her kidnappers. Alex and Grant climb a cliff to reach a tower where they can telephone. The President wants his daughter saved. What is the risk factor? Grant and Alex make plans. The kidnappers will have no need for Jess after the exchange. Can Alex contact Jess with instructions? Yes. The helicopter lands, two men get out. Alex walks through the woods. One kidnapper is eliminated by an FBI agent. The exchange begins, but there is a surprise. There is shooting! Alex and Jess jump into the river, Grant arrives with his rubber raft. The lone kidnapper gets into his rubber raft to pursue them. Rough waters threaten the raft. They go over the falls. [A long shot hides the stunt doubles.] Alex and Grant attack the lone kidnapper, then there is help just in time. [But we all expected this.] The good guys are rescued for a happy ending. There is a report on the effect of that rocket attitude that justifies Alexs action. In the end Jess gets her driving lesson!

This is a good story in spite of some implausible parts, like the attack on the Presidents party in the beginning. The rest is like the usual action adventure story where the good guys are threatened by bad guys but triumph in the end. Its shows some scenery of the wilderness. Why would anyone want to travel there unarmed? Four-legged creatures remain a threat.",1485129600,,3420,4.676079734219269

7926315,2,B00004XPQ1,"This a movie that makes absolutely no sense. It starts of as your usual secret service agent uses common sense to save the President's life but didn't technically follow procedures so her boss wants her sacked. However the President likes her (not just professionally) and while she awaits her investigation for dismissal trial, he decides to send her with just two other agents to guard his daughter on a rafting trip to Australia. Of course the daughter isn't too thrilled that the agent trying to get into her dad's pants is one of these three. There are only three as even though he has just been attacked and you'd think security would be increased, its because his daughter doesn't like having lots of security around cramping her style. Meanwhile the terrorists, who have just escaped through a tunnel from their own wilderness hangout, with their leader being captured, have decided to also take a vacation to Australia where they can reenact their Daryl, Walking Dead crossbow carrying fantasies in the Australian wilderness.

Spoilers - Of course they happen while perving on some kids camping on the banks of a river through their binoculars, to realise it's unusual for three adult rafters in Australia to have guns and also that one of those kids with them is the President's daughter. Conveniently even though this is supposed to be a pretty isolated area, they can somehow journey back to their vehicle quickly which somehow with Australia's gunlaws is full of weapons they can use to make it back in time before the group has packed up, (helped by the fact the daughter is misbehaving) shoot the unsuspecting three agents and kidnap the president's daughter so they can use her as a bargaining chip to get their leader released. Of course like most poor quality written films the female agent isn't dead, and with the help of a guide who she's threatened, demeaned and bullied to get him to make concessions for her group, she will prove she's really worth keeping on the payroll.

I'm pretty sure the rafting trip is not supposed to be in Australia, but since Australian vegetation is so distinctive compared to American (and Northern Hemisphere) wilderness, it's pretty obvious we're in Australia. Also the fact most of the actors are from Australian soapies, also is a bit of giveaway. Dominic Purcell (the leader of the bad guys in Australia) may seem more American now but this film was made six years before 2005 would have him bulk up and play an American in prison for Prison Break). Heartbreak High, Water Rats as well as Home and Away were where viewers had seen him before this. Tempany Deckert (the President's daughter's best friend) was also in Home and Away at the same time. You'll recognise most of the other cast (well maybe you won't) from Australian television shows too. Like most made for TV movies, this one uses a big name from an American TV show no longer on the air to get financed and hopefully viewers, with Melrose Place's Doug Savant as the tour guide who has the personality clashes with the secret agent who of course has to team up with her to save the day.

This is one of those movies that has you yelling at the screen. Such as why aren't at the lodge before the rafting trip. When the three agents are hanging out at a picnic table outside the hotel, who is protecting the President's daughter? Why are the agents who you'd imagine are on duty drinking in a bar attached to the lodge? Surely you're not supposed to drink while on the job? When bullets start flying out in the wilderness why does the secret service woman Meercat style sits up and looks around to work out what is happening? This is also a movie where it's obvious they are in front of a green screen when they are climbing a cliff, or diving in front of an exploding cabin that for some reason the bad guys detoured their plans of kidnapping the daughter to take the time to rig up with explosives that they also conveniently must have had in their car, just in case one of the three people they planned on killing straight away decided to stop there for a while instead of pursuing them.

Ultimately there really isn't much action. Most of it is at the start, and even that is low budget, I would think the secret service would have better helicopters than the ones used. None of the characters are likable at all, except maybe the raft guide. The female agent is pretty old, yet is referred to as eye candy and things like this by other agents and characters. It's more entertaining because it's such a bad movie, rather than entertaining because of anything in the actual storyline.",1479254400,,4606,4.661746617466175
