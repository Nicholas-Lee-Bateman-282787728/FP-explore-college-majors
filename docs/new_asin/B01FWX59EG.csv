7752076,5,B01FWX59EG,Funny and entertaining... how would Freud solve a 'simple' marital problem - especially if it's a Vampire?,1481760000,,106,5.294117647058823

7752078,4,B01FWX59EG,"TRULY worth 4 stars. It was cute, funny, a little creepy, very sexy, and even innocent. This one goes in my personal library!",1475539200,,125,4.478260869565218
7752079,4,B01FWX59EG,"For anybody who's getting into the all-hallows-eve/autumnal mood, I recently watched a hilarious, foreign-language film which I'd highly recommend (available for rental on Amazon): ""Therapy for a Vampire [English Subtitled]"" 2016 by director David Ruehm. While I'm partial to lycanthrope films, for a comedy/horror(-ish) vampire film this is quite well-done and engaging. Lots of great word play, a smart plot, some new cinematic vampire tropes, and not overly violent or gory.",1473811200,2,477,5.732394366197183
7752080,4,B01FWX59EG,"""I'm not good at self-reflection,"" a new patient tells Sigmund Freud in the Austrian horror comedy, Therapy for a Vampire. ""I feel old and tired. I've seen everything. . . . I no longer have a thirst for life.""

A stylish, painterly picture that evokes classic horror films from the 1930s, writer-director David Rhm's send-up of genre films is about a vampire who is facing an existential crisis.

Rhm has an ear for the absurd that reminds one of Monty Python. But his humor is as dry as they come - Therapy for a Vampire elicits ironic smiles, not belly laughs.

It's 1932, and Count Geza von Kozsnom (Tobias Moretti), a lean, handsome, tortured soul, is tired of his aimless existence.

The love of his life, Nadila, died eons ago (""dervishes beheaded her in Constantinople""), and he's sick of putting up with the incessant complaints of his wife of 500 years, Elsa (Jeanette Hain). A sexy, monstrously narcissistic, black leather-clad mass murderer, Elsa is obsessed by her inability to see her own reflection.

What would any self-respecting, angst- and ennui-ridden denizen of Vienna do in the count's position? Make an appointment with Freud, of course.

Rhm's clever script plays on the misunderstandings that arise when Freud interprets the count's literal descriptions as symbolic ones.

When the count says, ""even food bores and wearies me,"" he's saying that he's no longer excited by the prospect of chasing down, terrifying, and savagely slicing up men and women for his dinner.

Things take a dramatic turn when the count meets steak-house waitress Lucy (Cornelia Ivancan), who is a dead ringer for Nadila.

Therapy for a Vampire doesn't have the comedic muscle of 2014's brilliant New Zealand import What We Do in the Shadows, which is hands down the best vampire satire in decades. Yet its premise and stunning photography help make it a compelling entry in the genre.",1468108800,5,1884,4.955555555555556
7752081,4,B01FWX59EG,"Clever, delightful, funny, good special effects. Manages to make the vampire concept new and entertaining.",1532736000,,106,6.133333333333334

7752084,4,B01FWX59EG,Very enjoyable and the female vampire's longing to see her reflection and how that ends up is very clever.  In fact the whole movie is clever and well scripted. Worth a look.,1531180800,,174,4.4375

7752097,5,B01FWX59EG,Great atmosphere with a charming humor. Highly recommend!,1517961600,,57,6.25
7752098,4,B01FWX59EG,"It's subtitled and not in English, but I didn't feel like I missed anything. It's a cute romcom with a vampire backdrop. There really is no gory scenes, but a small bit of blood. Freud is actually a character in the movie so there are definitely some jokes related to that. The plot is a bit slow and stalls at times, but the movie is overall cute and more like a series of bits. The bits are pretty good though.",1510704000,,412,4.1625
7752099,2,B01FWX59EG,"I'm sure it was a great idea, but it didn't work for me.
Basically, this is a French Farce (husbands and wives, older and younger, mixing and matching) with an attempt to put Freud in the middle.",1507248000,,195,4.297297297297297
7752100,5,B01FWX59EG,Hilarious!!! It's a keeper...,1500508800,,29,6.5

7752102,4,B01FWX59EG,The story line was good. I'm dyslexic so I have difficulty watching the movie and reading the subtitles at the same time.,1494806400,,121,4.545454545454546
7752103,5,B01FWX59EG,"Outstanding foreign language comedy horror film about a vampire husband and wife who have just been together for too long - over 500 years - and can't seem to get along anymore.  I believe the film is in German, but I don't speak German so I could be wrong.  The English subtitles work very well, though.  The film has a great, unique plot and great acting.",1494460800,,357,4.378787878787879
7752104,4,B01FWX59EG,"I'm not sure why some viewers couldn't understand it; there were English closed caption subtitles.  I thought the humor was good, but very dry.  If you expected something more slap-sticky, like Monty Python--wrong country.  This is a German or Austrian film.  They even take their humor seriously.  I thought the vampire needing therapy was subtly funny, and so was the wife he was so very sick of.  I don't think it was ever meant to be anything but light and amusing.  I was definitely amused.",1490227200,4,495,4.752941176470588
7752105,5,B01FWX59EG,"awesome, only wish it was in english, lol",1486252800,,41,4.25

7752107,2,B01FWX59EG,I thought this was supposed to be a comedy. It wasn't funny.,1485129600,2,60,4.083333333333333
7752108,4,B01FWX59EG,I started watching this simply by reading the plot summary on Prime. I thought it was hilarious!,1484179200,,96,4.705882352941177
7752109,5,B01FWX59EG,Normally I have little taste for foreign language films but this one was fantastic!,1482451200,,83,5.0
7752110,5,B01FWX59EG,One of my all-time fave movies now!,1481932800,,35,4.142857142857143
8761698,5,B01FWX59EG,"I loved this movie! How many other movies offer horror, humor, satire and evoke some of the great movies of the 1930s. The satire is very subtle. Example the Count & Countess' name is Hungarian for thank you - ""ksznm"". So thank you for your blood! My German is pretty good and the translation from German to subtitles captured the original very well.",1537401600,,350,4.571428571428571
8761699,4,B01FWX59EG,"Just a solid pleasantly enjoyable humorous vampire movie. Not a great movie, but well worth the time spent watching it. Just right for a lazy afternoon, especially if you like your movies a bit quirky. If you liked What We Do In The Shadows, you'll like this movie.",1535673600,,265,4.541666666666667
8761700,5,B01FWX59EG,"DO YOU WANT TO HEAR THE GOOD OR BAD FIRST? I ALWAYS SELECT THE BAD: THIS MOVIE IS IN GERMAN & IF Y9U'RE NOT INTO ENGLISH CAPTIONING THEN THIS MOVIE IS PROBABLY NOT FOR YOU. SO YOU HAVE TO DO A LITTLE EXTRA WORK - BUT IT'S ALL WORTH IT! THIS  IS A SLY, BLACK HUMOR SEND-UP TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEN & WOMEN TOLD WITH HUMAN & VAMPIRES. THE DIALOGUE IS SNAPPY & THE GRAPHICS & SOUND EFFECTS ARE A TESTIMONIAL TO A TRULY GIFTED DIRECTOR WHO GIVES US A THROWBACK  TO THE OLD MOVIES. DON;T MISS IT JUST BECAUSE OF THE ENGLISH CAPTIONING. IT'S A FUN THROWBACK TO A TIME WHERE QUALITY MEANT EVERYTHING IN A MOVIE. I'M GIVING IT 5 STARS!",1535500800,,634,4.104838709677419

8761704,5,B01FWX59EG,"Turned into a vampire and living for 500 years, a woman can see the changes in fashion go by, but can't see herself in a mirror to check her hair or makeup. For 500 years! This can make even the most beautifully-preserved woman get a bit, well, cranky and difficult to live with.  For hubby, also 500 years married, it gets to be just too much and he dreams of his original lost love. That's when it is time to visit a shrink. The arrival on the scene of a beautiful mortal girl who looks like his lost love sends everything into a comic tailspin.  A delightful romp with clear subtitles.",1534118400,,588,4.288288288288288
