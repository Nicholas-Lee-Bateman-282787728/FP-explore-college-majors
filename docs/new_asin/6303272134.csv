7843046,4,6303272134,"Or whatever her name may be now.  Aw, you know, the hot redhead!  With the brown eyes and curly hair?  Yeah, her!  I think this may be the only real ""movie"" she's been in (although she was in one called ""Life Without Dick"" on which I will not comment) and of course, it holds the distinction of being lampooned on MST3K.  I love reading reviews of movies that have been on MST3K.  Most usually go like this: ""tihs movee only good but Mysteri 3000 vershun!"" or some other type of misspelled jumble of junk.  Anyway, this movie ain't great, folks.  The plot is bad (why do stupid people love Leonardo da Vinci so much?), the acting (except the afore-mentioned Ms. Brannagh) is bad and the sets look like someone went through George Lucas' garbage after ""Willow"" and tried to create a ""fantasy realm"" from the scraps therein.  Still, it is a nice fantasy movie with a happy ending.  And Brigid Branagh.  I mean Brigid Brannagh.  Uh, Brigid Brannah?  Brigid Walsh?  Brigid Conley?  Anyway, she's in it is about 16 and makes me feel all dirty.  That's why I like it.",1105401600,2,1061,4.505263157894737
7843047,1,6303272134,"This movie is [weak] just because of the acting alone. I don't know whether this characters can act or not...or is it just that the script was [weak].  It was [weak] from the very beginning. On the whole plot, it was not even interesting. I thought it might pick up later but it never did...the movie got worse. Wait til u see the [imitation] sword fights in this movie. ... There are better medieval movies than this movie. ...",1052006400,,428,4.417721518987341
7843048,5,6303272134,"It might be a cheap production, but its a good film to sit down and watch. I would recomend this film to anyone that likes movies for what they are worth.",1021161600,2,154,4.0
7843049,3,6303272134,"Direct to video, with a starring cast of David Warner, David Warner, David Kriegel, Brigid Conley Walsh,
 and Corbin Allred (also in Diamonds (1999).
The quest is to at first stop David Warner from killing David Warner. David Warner is the good guy and he isn't, that is, he has duel roles.  The Quest is to find the lost store house filled with all sorts of neat stuff.  Note: the rip-off music from ""Empire of the Sun"" by John Williams, at the beginning of the film.

Other then that; it's an okay little movie, and I think your
kids might enjoy it. You might also like it, if you are able to laugh at badly made movies.",1014336000,2,622,4.2905982905982905
7843050,3,6303272134,"The correct title is ""quest of the Delta Knights""  not Delta Kings. I searched for the correct title and couldn't find it. By happenstance, we found the movie just by accident. If you aren't getting  any orders, this could be the reason!!!",923788800,,239,4.666666666666667
