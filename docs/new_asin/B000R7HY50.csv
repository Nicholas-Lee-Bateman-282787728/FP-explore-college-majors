2859233,2,B000R7HY50,"It isn't until you find yourself re-counting the plot of ""11:59"" to someone, that the significance of director Jamin Winan's ambitious feature film debut begins to dawn on you. The subject matter is heady and involved, touching on a myriad of issues, from the role the media plays in our lives to the importance of following ones instincts. Ultimately however, Winan's aspirations are grander than his achievements in ""11:59,"" yet we do get a glimpse of the potential to come from this film school dropout.

As with all Double Edge Film productions (Winan's and producing partner Joe Sekiya's Denver based film company) ""11:59"" is concerned with perception and purpose and the themes the duo have explored in their preceding short films, re-emerge here in broader more refined strokes.

The picture opens with a burst of nervous energy as a breaking news story unfolds. The camera hand held, the edits quick, the music lively. Winans is eager to draw us in but doesn't quite achieve sure footing until after the initial 15 minutes when the action settles down. The films strongest visual styles recall moments from two other indie darlings - ""Trainspotting"" and ""Requiem for a Dream"", of which the latter is the most blatant. Director of Photography Jeff Pointer frames the sequences well and Winans, not only writer and director, does triple duty as editor, saving the films mediocre performances with smart cuts that keep the pacing steady and engaging.

Raymond Andrew Bailey gives a committed performance in the role of Aaron Doherty, the Jimmy Stewart of the piece, who experiences a flash forward revelation which allows him to ultimately touch ground and reconnect with something more significant than his career ambitions have. Bailey is likable and very watchable in the role, however he brings nothing particularly unique to his character, other than communicating mild frustration in relation to the existential mire in which he finds himself entwined. The juiciest role of the enterprise falls in the hands of Liz Cunningham, an alum of Double Edge, who previously was lensed by Winans and company in the short film ""The Maze"". Here Cunningham gets to play an edgy high profile news producer who seems hell bent on her station becoming ""Colorado's News Leader"" but in fact has some dirty laundry. It is Cunningham who gets the best dialogue,although at times she comes across as caricature. In every scene she appears, she plays the same level of intensity. A more nuanced performance would have made a world of difference. Laura Fuller as Lisa Winders, reporter and sidekick to cameraman Aaron, comes across as mousy at times but does have effective moments. As with director Winans, these actors seem poised for future success.

The films imagery does linger in the mind. Perhaps the most standout imagery and finest moment comes near films end. Aaron is pushing himself to the limit in a race against the clock so as to alter a foreshadowed outcome. The scene serves as a fitting metaphor to this indie accomplishment,nearly five years in the making, which like our hero in ""11:59"" is sure to propel Jamin Winans into a fuller realization of an already purposeful career. - Thomas O'Connor",1188432000,4,3204,5.039622641509434
8199036,5,B000R7HY50,I feel this was a good film based on the complete film storyline. If your aware that most films like this have at least one well known actor or actress if this film also has that the positive following and reviews would be greater over all remake the same film with a better known cast and it would have been a classic.,1435622400,,319,4.161290322580645
8199037,3,B000R7HY50,"Surprisingly good plot makes this a low-budget film worth renting.

Aaron Dougherty (Raymond Andrew Bailey) is a photojournalist far removed from emotion. He has to be to tell stories, like that of two horrific child murders that rocked the city just before a hotly-contested election. But after getting the break of his career on Monday, Dougherty loses 24 hours of his life  with no memory of what happened, or how he ended up in a hay field hours from the city on Wednesday morning. Its career suicide for him not to show up to work  to miss the biggest day of follow up on the case of his career  but he has no idea what happened, and cant offer anyone a good explanation  or at least, one they will believe.

Aaron is reprimanded by hard-assed news director Adel (expertly played by Liz Cunningham), and now has a job doing traffic reports with his narcissistic reporter comrade Lisa (a cardboard Laura Fuller). As he works, a know-nothing assignment turns up a tidbit that relates to the child murders, and could prove that the man taken into custody is really innocent. No one wants to listen to him, and Aaron begins to believe the alleged killers claim that a conspiracy theory put him behind bars. As he puts the facts together, Aaron discovers that the day he lost is somehow related to the child murders case, and he has to figure out what to do with that information before its too late.

The concept of ""11:59"" is reminiscent of the Sandra Bullock film ""Premonition,"" except the two are reversed. In ""Premonition,"" the acting was good, the story needed work. In ""11:59,"" some acting was so-so, while the psychological plot offered up some great moments.

I was genuinely surprised that it was a good movie. Seriously, I was afraid it was one of those that offered up slick jacket copy and graphics, but no content. Its low budget. There are no major actors in this film, so I didn't have anything to go on but the jacket. Even with the so-so acting moments, 11:59 kept me interested. I wanted to know where the story was going. It wasn't all gore or ""CSI,"" but more psychological and I enjoy that; not all film goers do. For the most part, it moved at a brisk pace, save for a running scene at the end that really needed to be cut down. Im also still not certain where the title came from. I wonder if I missed something along the way that explained it.

In most cases, TV news is portrayed accurately. Tough bitch news director Adel is exactly what reporters deal with in newsrooms. Aaron is a photog who will do anything to get the shot  including chasing an alleged child murder. (Ive seen them run after a lot less in my news days.) It was at the end when they lost their grip on reporting reality. Lisa argues with Hastings attorneys about doing an off-the-record interview with no camera. A reporter doesnt look a gift horse in the mouth; she takes the opportunity and, all the while, figures out ways to put what she learns on the record later. She gets the story, doesnt piss off her sources and everyone goes home happy.

""11:59"" is worth a look as a rent. DVD contains interviews with Bailey and director Jamin Winans, photography, trailer, spin and a short film. There are also Spanish subtitles.",1423267200,,3221,4.555363321799308
8199038,2,B000R7HY50,"I have enjoyed Jamin Winans later work such as Ink and The Frame.

This film, however, was not nearly of the same quality. The script felt read/repeated by most of the actors and the music was lacking. Film quality was mediocre at best.

The story was intriguing at points, but ultimately fell short in clarity and momentum.

I enjoyed the overall message and had a a very well done/emotional scene near the end, but other than that I was severely underwhelmed.

It is, however, nice to see the progression of a great film artist like Jamin Winans",1417651200,,547,4.608247422680412
8199039,5,B000R7HY50,"The trailer on YouTube doesn't do the movie justice.  It exceeded my expectations.  Because it was Jamin Winan's first film, I wasn't sure how good it was going to be.  It's more straightforward than ""Ink"" and it has less fantasy elements.  However, in terms of quality in film and story, it's just as good.  It also has an interesting commentary about the news media and politics without picking a side.  For his first feature, Jamin Winans did not disappoint.  Now I can't wait to see ""The Frame""!",1409270400,,499,4.666666666666667
8199040,4,B000R7HY50,"This is a riveting, edge-of-your-seat thriller.  Thought-provoking too.  You will enjoy it.",1408320000,,91,6.5
8199041,4,B000R7HY50,"The acting was not 'hollywoodish',  and took some getting used to.  Overall, though, the premise of the film is fascinating, and by the end of the movie, I was rooting for the main character, cared about the outcome, and was profoundly touched by the idea of second chances and deeper motivations for self sacrifice.  Lovely film...wish Jamin Winans would continue to write and direct.  His work is thought provoking and spiritual.",1383523200,,431,5.028169014084507
8199042,1,B000R7HY50,"11:59 is as indie as independent films get and from the very beginning you could tell, this was not a film that had any kind of budget. The film is yet another take on Groundhog Day, as a man wakes up in a field, missing 24 hours. He goes about his day trying to figure out what happened, when miraculously he winds up back in the missing day and continues to re-live it. Being that this film had no budget, it was up to the cast to make it believable and worthwhile, unfortunately they fail miserably at it. I get that they were all newcomers, looking for their big break, but the performances here are beyond awful. The lead is played by Raymond Bailey, who has no personality. He actually had long scenes where he wonders around aimlessly, without saying a word, and just doesn't know what to do with himself. The rest of the cast was also terrible, ranging from boring to completely over the top. I've seen a lot of a bad movies and most didn't have the story to work with, that 11:59 did. I can honestly say never have I seen a cast of people who were less qualified to be on the screen. The low budget meant no special effects and no big named actors, but in order to make the film work, they had to give us something, but didn't! When I wasn't in shock over how bad the acting was, I was bored out of my mind, this movie was nothing but a huge waste of time!",1365897600,,1365,4.174242424242424
8199043,3,B000R7HY50,"Fantastic-looking film, with surprisingly high production values for a low-budget first feature.  The only failing is the script, which plays like a couple of high school kids' take on grown-up life, as seen by way of time travel and new-age mysticism.  This makes a certain amount of sense, as it's a story about grown-up life by way of time travel and new-age mysticism, written by a couple of high school kids.  It took them a few years to get the funding but the roots still show.  Still, an entertaining film if you like this sort of thing, and a great primer on making a low-budget film - most especially if you're working out of town.  This isn't nearly as good as their next film, Ink, but absolutely worth a look.",1361232000,,722,4.523076923076923
8199044,1,B000R7HY50,"To say that the script was written by a no talent bum would be a compliment to the script writer. And the director? Give a three year old a handheld camera and an editor on crack and you'd achieve the same result. Stay away from this huge, huge, HUGE piece of crap. The final insult is that ""11:59"" ... the title .... has nothing to do with anything.",1323820800,,350,4.161764705882353
8199045,2,B000R7HY50,"11:59 is a film with an interesting premise, but it's so poorly executed, it sabotages that premise.  Unbelievable gimmicks, no explanation for the title, or how our hero manages to go back and forth in time.  Add some inept performances from Raymond Anthony Bailey, Laura Fuller and Liz Cunningham and you have a reasonably inexplicable movie.  nice try, though.",1194220800,3,363,5.11864406779661
