He takes you through easy to follow instructions from several different camera angles. He offers many tips on follow and lead. I would definitely recommend this to beginner dancers and people wanting to teach.",1366416000,2,337,4.524590163934426
8159882,5,B000L2BTTI,"I have to admit, I was skeptical about the idea of learning to dance from a DVD but since my husband's work schedule didn't allow for us to take classes I thought I would give it a try.  The instruction is so clear and easy to follow we were dancing around our living room in no time!!  I would definitely recommend this collection to anyone looking to learn to swing!!!",1349481600,,370,4.271428571428571
8159883,5,B000L2BTTI,"This group of Swing videos is well worth the purchase price many times over!  I never knew how to dance until I started going to a country dance venue about 4 months ago and began attending $7/2 hour events once a week.  I was able to learn the primitive basics, but found myself getting left behind when all the fun moves were being taught, so I purchased the Shawn Trautman Swing Starter Pack.  The first video will get you enough basics and simple moves to hold your own in any club.  The material is very in depth, and easy to understand step by step.  By the time you make it through the second video you'll be one of the people that 9 out of 10 folks in the crowd wish they could dance like.  The way the moves are laid out and build upon each other make child's play out of dance maneuvers that I never imagined myself being able to do.  The third and final disc is just as good as the second as it throws even more moves at you along with combinations that will have you throwing around your partner from the beginning to end of each song with ease.  In the 2-3 weeks that I've been going over these videos I honestly think it would have taken me over a year to even learn half the material without a private instructor.  Keeping this review honest, the only bad thing I could say about these dvds would be that on a hi-def tv the picture quality loses a bit of clarity when the cameras change to the close-up view.  However, I still rate this set with 5 stars because the quality of the instruction and the way it was presented is what really matters, and I couldn't have asked for better.",1304899200,2,1598,4.2269736842105265
8159884,5,B000L2BTTI,The instructions are wonderful and the tips are great.  And you have enough time to practice the steps while they're still on screen showing you. (short but sweet),1243900800,,163,4.821428571428571

8159886,5,B000L2BTTI,"I bought the first of these three DVD's(Beginner 1) and found that to be an excellent DVD. It taught me the basics of right turns, left turns, and other basic turns.

I then got the other two DVD's and found that I had a great foundation as regards to learning basic Swing Dancing. I found it best to see the DVD's several times and master one move before learning the next. I liked the explaination of both lead and follow basics. This way no one is left out.

Also, the sections are well outlined so that if you want to practice one or two specific turns, there is easy access to that particular turn.

This was a very wise investment for me.

In addition, from e-mails that I have gotten from them, they really care about their students.

Thanks again for an excellent series.",1176422400,9,779,4.381944444444445
8159887,5,B000L2BTTI,"When I first bought from Shawn's DVD collection, it was so I wouldn't look like a fool at events. This time, I chose the swing pack since I love swing music and its really peppy, upbeat style. When I got the package, I immediately got to dancing. By that evening, I had already learned multiple dance moves and some new dance sequenes to dance to the next time I was out with friends. I really enjoyed the DVDs and will likely buy more.",1168387200,10,436,4.265060240963855
