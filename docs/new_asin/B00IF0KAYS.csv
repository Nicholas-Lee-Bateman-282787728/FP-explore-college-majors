6262053,5,B00IF0KAYS,"I saw Francis the Talking Mule movies when I was a boy in Toccoa, Georgia, and I have never gotten tired of watching them and having great laughs!!!  So, sit down and enjoy a good soft drink and a large and hot bowl of popcorn!!!!  Many thanks to AMAZON.com!!!",1399766400,2,260,4.285714285714286
6262054,5,B00IF0KAYS,A great comedy with a very calm animal at the center. with the use of salt to make the mule open its mouth. the action is done for comedy and Donald O'Conner was a new comer and a great job. The movies are just for fun.,1399593600,,219,3.782608695652174
6262055,3,B00IF0KAYS,of course they are very good movies but because there is a but I am French and I bought the box because there were subtitles ... but not all movies only on the first 4 and I had already ... so I'm frustrated because I do not speak English well enough to understand everything! What a pity for me!,1399507200,10,296,4.033898305084746
6262056,5,B00IF0KAYS,Being a child or the sixties I remember watching these movies as a youngster and loved them!! Until this set is delivered I have had access to the first Francis movie and watch it often! They are a great diversion and well loved! I cant wait to add the other six to my movie collection. Francis keeps the grandchildren enthralled and laughing!! I wish the new movies coming out had 1/2 the entertainment value!,1397088000,30,410,4.554054054054054
6262057,5,B00IF0KAYS,"Keenly waiting for this release of the complete collection of FRANCIS films. Wondering if I grew up on the Universal City backlot because what I remember most from my Saturday afternoon matinees at the local movie house are screenings of Abbott and Costello, Ma and Pa Kettle, Tony Curtis and Piper Laurie in the Arabian desert and of course, Francis the Talking Mule.  Thank you Universal-International, for catering for boys and girls of all ages during those so-called ""innocent"" days of the fifties.  Of these seven films, the first six were directed by Arthur Lubin and starred Donald O'Connor supported by the usual bevy of Universal-International contract players and wonderful character actors. Some of the up and coming stars to look out for are Tony Curtis, Clint Eastwood, Piper Laurie, Martha Hyer, Julie Adams, Mamie Van Doren, Gregg Palmer, David Janssen, Martin Milner and Paul Burke. Lubin was an interesting director who made the memorable 1943 version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"", ""Rhubarb"" (the cat), more or less discovered Clint Eastwood and created and produced the unforgettable MR. ED series for television. Mr. Lubin certainly made a career out of loveable animals which we should all be grateful for.  The series of FRANCIS movies were no classics but just highly entertaining fun flicks, full of corn and delight, helped enormously by O'Connor's likeability, the loveable mule and of course, the gravelly voice of Chill Wills. Incidentally the last film, probably the weakest of the series, featured a couple of significant changes: Mickey Rooney replaced O'Connor and Paul Frees became the ""voice"".  You won't be disappointed with these films.  Just sit back and enjoy them for what they are, just wacky, harmless entertainment for all.",1393286400,98,1766,5.182456140350877
6262058,5,B00IF0KAYS,"In my youth Donald O'Connor and Francis the talking mule set a comedy standard which no one has approached again..  Here  is a new beginning.  Donald O'Connor was becoming a big time star when they decided to make 'White Christmas"", Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney and Donald O'Connor and Vera Ellen"" The reality is Donald O'Connor came down with a mule virus and couldn't make White Christmas.  That is the last "" Francis"" movie Donald made.  Donald was at his best  in the Francis movies and the great musicals of the time.  When asked ""Gene Kelly"", Who was the most underrated dancer, he said ""Donald O'Connor"".  To bad Elvis came along and ruined musicals for ever after.

6262081,5,B00IF0KAYS,Brought back memories. Couldn't wait to get it to watch. Love the old B&W movies! The only negative comment I have is that the case was cracked when I received it and 1 of the discs was scratched. Of course I watched the movies on that particular disc to make sure they were okay. But I would recommend this seller use bubble wrap envelopes or a better means of package when sending his movies. Thanks for the memories!!,1518307200,,420,4.397435897435898

6262087,1,B00IF0KAYS,"I bought the 4 movie collection earlier and was happy for the old fashioned non violent themes. So when I saw the complete series at a great price I jumped on it. Everything would have been fairytale but I run into the occasional glitch in the sales process. See the unscrupulous venders will create a shipping label and tell the overlord that it's on its way, pay me. But in reality the item takes weeks to send, either through outright fraud or they'd rather ship once weekly instead of daily. Meantime the overseer takes your money and pays the huckster. This happens every day but most don't realize the scam perpetrated on them and wait and wait and wait for their purchase. It would be caught by normal business practices and reported as fraud. But the overlord has a vested interest in keeping status quo so there is faith in the system. Wouldn't want a panic in the masses causing loss of sales and/or profit. Much better to screw the occasional buyer and give free money to the scoundrel. Eventually the product gets to the customer. Why bother with keeping sellers honest.",1513555200,,1082,4.640625

The discs are new and excellent. I'm just amazed that in this day and time ANY THING would take an entire week to travel from sea to shining sea. . Much less from the center of the states to any edge. .. in any direction.

I liked this set so much, I bought a copy for my dad too, who ""corrupted"" us with this sort of entertainment when we were kids. Francis in the Navy is my favorite- with Jim Backus, and a VERY young Clint Eastwood. The scene of Francis landing triumphantly onto the beach in the DUKW is brilliant. Quality is good.

So why did I give it four stars instead of five?  The last movie in the series, ""Francis in the Haunted House"" was mediocre.  Mickey Rooney was his sidekick instead of Donald O'Connor.  He was okay, but I don't think he made as good a foil for Francis.

A cheerful B film that Mamie Van Doren co-starred in. In 1954 Mamie was under contract to Universal and did the films she was assigned. Hopefully more of her Universal ones will be released on DVD also. Like Forbidden, The All American, Yankee Pasha, The Second Greatest Sex, Running Wild, Ain't Misbehavin',and Star In The Dust. Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield have had film collection released, Why not Mamie ? She still has a slew of fans, and like me would buy them. I have met Mamie and she is so nice to her fans. I admire her stand on women's and gay rights. A living legend and one of the last stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood.

I don't know if it's a political thing or just to soften the calamities of war. Even though these are before my aged time, I remember seeing them rerun when I was a kid. I found them very interesting and funny. And now, although on the corny, far-fetched side, I still find them entertaining.

All 7 movies have a pretty good story to keep you engrossed along with decent acting and some good effects for the era they were originally made. And the transfer from film to DVD is really good showing much better picture clarity than I ever remember. The original sound was monophonic but the DVD has a slight simulated stereo effect.

Since these movies are not rated, I would consider the fact they are depicting war and violence and death before showing to younger viewers. Otherwise, if you're looking for (classic?) entertainment, these are an interesting choice. They may even be a conversation starter/topic for anyone. HEE-HAW!",1412899200,,1035,4.712707182320442

everyone's cup-of-tea... coffee... Coke...
7-Up! But, you CANNOT deny the price
IS better than it has EVER been... and I'm
telling you it sure takes up a hell of a lot
LESS shelf space.

6262352,2,B00IF0KAYS,"The two stars are for all seven shows at a great price. Unfortunately the manufacturing is less than great. I'm on the second of three discs and both of the movies stop about three quarters of the way through and the only way I could get them going again was to unplug the player to turn it off because the disc prevents any commands to the player. Once I get it on again I go to the scene listing as close to where it stopped and then fast forward to the faulty spot. The movies do continue from that point, but it takes out much of the enjoyment from the viewing.
If I have any issues with the third disc I will update this review, but I wanted to be sure other interested buyers know what they might be in for. This disc is acting much like the cheap Memorex blank discs most stores now carry but I will never buy again (I buy Sony which is a much more reliable disc.)

There is more going on under the surface than at first appears (no spoilers, but the Army is not as dumb as some would like you to think... 'nuff said).  The first move is a real fun romp and the rest of the series carries on, just don't expect singing and dancing.  I was a bit disappointed because I adore Donald O'Connor's singing and dancing, but these are straight drama/comedy, pre-Singing in the Rain days.",1405814400,,585,4.4485981308411215

6262366,5,B00IF0KAYS,"Francis the Talking Mule and Mr Ed the Talking Horse would have made a great team, like Abbott and Costello, Laurel and Hardy, Lewis and Martin or even The 3 Stooges, if maybe they could have got Champion The Wonder Horse to join them. But Champion was just an ordinary horse when compared to the other two, though he was the spitting image of Mr Ed and his TV series only lasted 1 year compared to Mr Ed, whose series lasted 5 years in the 1960's , if only Champion could talk, yet still he was The World's Wonder Horse .

Whether it is Francis, or whether it is Mr Ed, it is fascinating to watch their head movements and lips as they talk, because these films were done way before special effects were done, and the vocal effects are so perfect, it's hard to believe that it isn't an actual person inside a costume doing the talking. Both of these characters were  smart alecky and wise cracking and quite mischievous and were a delight to watch.

Mr Ed spent a lot of time in his barn, reading, watching TV, recording and singing love songs,, sometimes he would venture outside to try to pick up a philly, and in his ventures he got to meet with George Burns, Zsz Zsa Gabor and even Clint Eastwood. Francis, in this collection of 7 movies gets around in quite a lot of places, he goes to the races, he goes to West Point, he covers the big town, joins the WACS, goes in the Navy  and ends up in a haunted house, he also has a flair for the ladies and even ends up meeting Mamie Van Doren.

So if you enjoy this collection of movies, then you might also want to check out the Mr ED TV series, lots of horsing around, you don't see this brand of comedy produced anymore.",1404518400,10,1671,4.225705329153605

The last movie in the series though - well, you can see why it's the last of the series. For one thing, Francis is no longer voiced by Chill Wills and Donald O'Connor doesn't appear either.

The rest of the movies are good fun though and if you look at some of the stars, you'll notice appearances by young actors such as: Clint Eastwood, Tony Curtis, David Janssen, Martin Milner, Paul Burke, Jim Backus, Leonard Nimoy (yes! Spock himself!), and you'll never forget Zasu Pitts as the dottering psychiatric nurse, who appears in several of the movies!",1400457600,2,623,4.495575221238938

6262398,5,B00IF0KAYS,"This collection comprises all seven Francis the Talking Mule movies, and I must say that this release is fantastic. All movies are presented here on 3 single sided DVDs (3 films on one, two each on the others) and are excellent transfers. It brings me back to my younger days (well AFTER these were released originally..lol) when I would watch these late at night on TV, good old fashioned comedy that didn't require crude jokes, sexual innuendo or nudity to get a laugh.

This set also has English sub-titles for the Deaf/Hard of hearing on all movies. I like to have these on when watching a movie anyway at night so I don't have to have the TV on too loud. There is also French and Spanish sub-titles on all except "" In the Navy"" and "" The Haunted House"".

I give it 5 stars for the nostalgic enjoyment and entertainment of the films, the fact that they are on single-sided discs and have English sub-titles. It would've been nice to get maybe a documentary on the series, or maybe a commentary or 2 from film historians etc. but that was probably too expensive for the studio to consider.

 If you love comedies from this era, do yourself a favour and purchase this set. at less than $20 you get 7 fun movies, with plenty of memories and laughs.  Recommended.",1399939200,31,1263,4.473913043478261
