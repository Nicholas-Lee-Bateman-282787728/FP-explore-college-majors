8078394,2,B000AFPY6A,"The plot is basic but it also rip-off other shows like The Real Ghostbusters,remember the ghost-hunting tools that they were using that shoted out silly-putty? They also rip-off Scooby-Doo when They find out that the ghost is a villain in a monster costume. The jokes are still cheesy & phone in a mile away. The ending is predictable. I give this ""rent me"" a 3 out of 10.",1287187200,,372,4.485294117647059
8078395,3,B000AFPY6A,"The plot sounds like 1980's sitcom story. The jokes are cheesy & tried. The Prince is bland. The action is ok. Another ""rent me"" then a ""buy me"" I give this tape a 5 out of 10.",1287187200,,176,3.7837837837837838
8078396,3,B000AFPY6A,"The animation is ok. The story is hit-and-miss. The voice acting is not great but pretty good. The jokes are phoned in a mile away. The Amazons are nothing then female versions of the male counterparts. The Villans are forgettable and also phoned in a mile away. This video is more of a ""rent me"" then a ""buy me"" I give this tape a 6 out of 10.",1287187200,,344,4.073529411764706
