5944173,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"I too saw them five months later in the spring of 85 in Tacoma WA. This brought back memories of one of the finest shows I have ever seen. Yes Jon Lord's ""rocking"" Hammond B3 stands out as does one of the greatest drummers of all time, Ian Paice's drum solo. Sound quality is outstanding as is the video quality. It's just so sad Ritchie couldn't play nice with Ian Gillan in their short career's together. Could you imagine if they had? This is a concert video of a band of master musicians at the top of their game. And they belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!",1382054400,2,568,4.172727272727273
5944174,4,B00EUEWQ2W,"I may be the first review to have actually watched this DVD. Very difficult to review this product. On one hand you have a band who are trying harder than I have ever seen them try. (And I have seen them many times) The Director and the overall intention in filming this performance are another story. In some ways this has a slight ""budget feel,"" even for 1984. At times it almost appears as though it was filmed for the band only, as there is no crowd featured, no keyboard views ,and no behind the drums footage. During ""Child in Time"" the Director reacted like a fish seeking a lure, as everytime Gillan played percussion he couldn't resist the shiny bongos! This occurred at a high cost too, as many times Blackmore was just flying on solos. (but he kept cutting to the congas.) (A bit like the Denmark footage from the early 70's at times) Fear not though!!...even with this dynamic there ARE plenty of times when Ritchie is featured during solos! It just could have been ""smarter."" To be fair this was 1984 and a long way from home ,so perhaps I am being a bit too hard on the Director Camera choices?

This comment is going to upset people but this show was filmed at a time when Ian Gillan still had his voice. Gillan gave it his all and Blackmore reciprocated. It was only later that Gillan's drinking/smoking and all night parties cost him his voice (and subsequently Blackmore's respect. ""Come Hell or High Water) I know, I can see the comments coming on how Blackmore did this and did that. For me after seeing the band many times, Blackmore was right.

 The good news is that Gillan and Blackmore in particular are just incredible on this DVD! Of course the rest of the band are great too,..especially Paice, but it's the Gillan/Blackmore show on this night. What a shame there are no angles of Lords keyboard playing :( Again, what were they thinking when they decided to shoot this? Why no close ups on the keyboards and drums?

For Gillan fans this is also the last opportunity to see Gillan doing justice to ""Child in Time""- he just kills it!

To recap, the editing is a bit weird, the sound is ""good but NOT state of the art"" and there is no real lighting and or ambience. I would rate the picture a 6 or 7 and the sound a 6 or 7. DO NOT GET ME WRONG THOUGH! It IS worth having but it is a compromise production- wise. This DVD shows why Deep Purple were so highly regarded. Too bad it wasn't a bigger budget and with a Director who had a more systemic feel of Deep Purple's musical dynamics. This is a perfect companion piece to Rainbow ""Black Masquerade"" for the Blackmore fanatic. I MUST recommend it for serious fans of the band. You will not see Blackmore happier on stage. (He doesn't leave the stage as much and plays through songs more thoroughly than in later years) As a side note: One thing that doesn't get mentioned much is Blackmore's stage presence. He hardly looks at his guitar and seems to make his actual playing seem effortless. He is very theatrical in the way he uses the stage too.

The ""extras"" are what is called a ""Tour documentary."" It is basically what looks like second generation interviews from the reunion and a bit of studio footage from Vermont, which was some of the same imagery taken from the video of the song ""Perfect Strangers."" There is a new section I had never seen before which was interesting as it showed them jamming/ recording. The footage just sort of fizzles out in the end. Cool to have but not very well planned. This DVD belongs in your collection. *Anyone expecting ""state of the art recording and camera work"" should spare us the complaining by staying clear. Five stars for the band and perhaps two or three for the Director.",1381795200,89,3700,4.457902511078286
5944175,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"There is a Providence, RI show?? There is also the Rockpalast show from Paris, taped in July 1995, that circulates well throughout the bootleg world, because it has not been officially released. Because it's a Rockpalast show, the quality is damn near perfect. That is a complete show, as opposed to what has been written here. The Rockpalast show is not very good, however, since Gillan's voice was in very rough shape that night. I have a bootleg recording of this Melbourne show. Can't wait to get the real thing, snatched from the hands of bootleggers.",1381795200,3,556,4.802083333333333
5944176,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"This is a fantastic show.  I have been waiting to see this for nearly 30 years.  Now Eagle Rock needs to find the Providence RI show that was filmed in March of 1985 and get that out.  Plus MTV shot a documentary at the time that was never released.  And one Holy Grail for me is the complete 10 min video shot while the band jammed the instrumental track ""Son of Alerik"".  Let's get this stuff out now before we are just too old.  We could have been enjoying this concert for the past 3 decades.",1381536000,28,496,4.114583333333333
5944177,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"This was shot in Sydney Australia way back in late 1984, please tell me why it took till 2013 to finally see the light of day!!!!! Anyway, if you are even just a casual fan of Deep Purple, this is a must! It is the only known footage of a complete show from the Perfect Strangers tour, and the band is on FIRE! It does not get much better from the classic Mark II line up of Ritchie Blackmore, Ian Gillan, Jon Lord, (R.I.P.), Roger Glover, and Ian Paice.  All the 'hits' are here, but 5 tracks from Perfect Strangers are included, (as they should be), and sound just as good mixed with the classics.  The picture, and sound is superb! I purchased the set that includes dvd and double cd of this stellar show.

5944180,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"Great DVD. Shows the energy and enthusiasm Deep Purple Mach II had when they reunited.

5944186,5,B00EUEWQ2W,I saw this tour in 1985 in Houston TX and it was great. Glad to find a DVD of the show. I wish all the bands would release their concert films so we could relive the event.,1466467200,,172,3.675675675675676
5944187,4,B00EUEWQ2W,"I was a Junior in college when they got back together and gave us a very good new album in Perfect Strangers, followed by the tour that I thought would never happen.  I was fortunate that they came through Detroit for two shows, about a month apart.  I saw both of them, and was not disappointed.  They were terrific.  So of course I had to get this DVD.  I enjoyed this DVD, and it certainly brought me back to those two shows that I saw in Detroit.  Richie Blackmore is at the top of his game on this DVD, and really seems to be getting into his solo's and enjoying himself.  Ian Gillan always seems to enjoy himself on a stage, and that comes out here as well.  Ian Paice was always vastly under-rated, imho, and his immense talent is prominently on display during his solo.  Jon Lord did things with a Hammond organ that I had never seen, and haven't seen since.  His solo is certainly a highlight of the concert.  And I gained a new appreciation for Roger Glover by watching this DVD.  Unfortunately the concert here was early in the tour before they added some production elements, namely limited usage of a video display screen as a backdrop to the stage, and especially the use of laser lighting during Perfect Strangers and Difficult To Cure.  The animated laser Beethoven playing on the display screen during Difficult To Cure was a highlight during the shows that I saw, but unfortunately you won't see it here.  Also missing is one of their best songs, Woman From Tokyo, which was used among the encores during the Detroit shows.  I wish they had been able to use a later show for this DVD so that it would include these missing elements, but this must have been what they had available.  Still, I certainly recommend this DVD if you are a Purple fan.",1464652800,,1763,4.445482866043614
5944188,4,B00EUEWQ2W,"No, this isn't from the Glory Days of ""Made In Japan""..........but it's acceptably close.  The video isn't bad at all for the year recorded, and 5.1 DTS playback sounded mighty fine on my home theater system.  Yes, there could have some interesting crown shots, different camera angles, etc., but the band was in fine form, and while Ian Gillan's voice clearly was past it's peak, it delivered vintage Purple.  And while Ritchie Blackmore's biggest solo was a bit overindulgent with the beginning noise, he talent on guitar is indisputable.  Any player who can melodically web classic bits by Bach and Beethoven into his work is okay in my book.  It would have been nice had he participated in the media outings, but.......he's Ritchie Blackmore.
As far as the importance of video recordings to a band's historical catalog go, this ranks to DP as ""Sacred Fire - Live in South America"" ranks to Santana and ""Rush In Rio"" ranks to that band.  Which is to say, an important, historical and well-done piece despite its few flaws which I found relatively few in number:  the 5.1 DTS bass mix appeared low in my system, so I had to bump up the level of my Rhythmik FG12 subwoofer a bit, Ian Gillan's conga playing was virtually absent from the sound mix, and the different video angles were limited.  All in all, it's definitely worthy of inclusion in any music DVD library.",1461369600,,1368,4.718487394957983

5944190,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"This is a very good concert, but they were better when I saw this concert live in the Twin Cities.  As I remember Gillan was spot on that night and it was awesome.  Richie smashed at least two guitars, and Jon Lord really had his keyboards rocking back and forth.  Girls School got booed off the stage.  Awesome laser show for that time period.  Permanent Strangers is still one of my favorite Deep Purple albums.",1457913600,,413,4.453333333333333

5944207,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"Great concert.  It has every good audio and video quality.

Any good Deep Purple should be collected and this is perhaps one of their very best shows on available on disc.  Ritchie Blackmore actually tried to please EVERYBODY including the rest of the band which is a random stroke of good luck.  Indeed Backmore and the rest of Deep Purple have had notoriously toxic relations and both are at their best when in sync and harmony together so that makes Perfect Strangers a must have for their true fans.

I also have Deep Purple's Hell or Highwater  dvd and prefer this dvd to it because of band tensions but play both of them regularly.

I cannot get enough of Ritchie Blackmore either.  Blackmore's Rainbow concert discs Black Masquerade and Live in Munich 1977 are amazingly mesmerizing and the sound quality allows hard cranking distortion free.  I can bury the volume all disc long and it still sounds perfectly clear at over 100 yards away.

Rainbow is perhaps Blackmore's best artistic expression but I liked his better days in Deep Purple better because of the band.  I just wish he could have stayed in Deep Purple and done his solo work too.  I really love what he did with Ronnie James Dio in Rainbow.  A Dio and Blackmore tour in Deep Purple back in the day would have been nice like Hagar and Anthony with DLR in Van Halen playing toxic free.",1428364800,,1355,4.572614107883817

I've been a Deep Purple fan since my parents took me to New Zealand on holidays in 1972 and we went to the duty free shop in Sydney before going and I bought a push button cassette player and I looked up on the wall at all the cassettes they had and as a 10 year old I saw 'Deep Purple in Rock' and chose that one and have been hooked ever since. Having said that the 30 years in between until the digital age and DVDs etc meant I hardly saw or had access to anything other than the vinyl albums (soon to be CD's) that I owned so once that hit I was buying as much as I could, but to me, nothing ever compared to the Made in Japan double album (as far as live stuff goes) that I cherished and when I could finally buy a DVD copy of the black and white concert in Copenhagen just before they went to Japan in 1972, I thought that was as good as it was going to get as all the other concerts on DVD always lacked something or were not my favourite Mk 2 line up.... A couple of weeks ago while reading a review of another Deep Purple DVD/compilation/anniversary/etc etc product, there was a mention of the Perfect Strangers 'Live' DVD as I had only heard (and only twice listened to that album) so I read some reviews of this concert and bought the DVD (the fact that I live in Australia where it was filmed helped a bit) and seriously, from the second I put it on I was not only captivated by it (as well as wondering why it had been hidden away for so long) but was loving the fact that this was way better than anything by them I had seen previously. Anyone who has listened to all 3 Japanese concerts from the Made in Japan days (care of the latest 40th anniversary package) will know that they were pretty much exact with almost every song on each night and most rock reviewers would always comment that Deep Purple was one of those bands whose songs sounded as good and as exact live as they did on record....but on this live performance the same old songs were there (and some new ones) but there was a lot of spontaneous solos and riffing and positive banter etc that I had never seen in other concerts of theirs currently on DVD. Other people may not be the same but for me (apart from  the song 'Difficult to Cure'), listening and watching in one block Lazy, Child In Time, Space Truckin,  Black Night, Speed King and then finishing with Smoke On The Water...in colour, with Ian Gillan's voice pretty much up there, was a dream come true (and yes I have the 1972 New York in colour concert as well) and for all I know I could have been in Japan in 1972...and for anyone out there looking at the recent 40th anniversary selection of packages for the Made in Japan album, the DVD of the making of the album is the best of it's kind I've seen and it alone is a must have. A highlight for me would have to be seeing the original black and white footage that was shot from that concert that is there in all its glory.... Enjoy!",1404000000,,2981,4.146804835924007
5944240,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"and I believe that is was probably back in about or around 1985 and will never forget the laser light that was burned around Blackmore as he was playing a fantastic guitar solo so fast that it looked to me as if he has disappeared. It was at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas Texas. By far one of the best shows that I had ever been to. - Iron Maiden on the World Slavery Tour was my next one at 100,000 watts of power inside Reunion Arena.",1399852800,,432,3.9770114942528734
5944241,4,B00EUEWQ2W,"I wonder who on earth would sit on live concert footage of Deep Purple v. 4 line up for 29 years? I sifted through the notes and gleemed out this was recorded in Australia and it probably sat in some closet for the last nearly three decades. It is 5 by 7 full screen format which is no wonder since it is this old. The dynamics are a bit flat for today's systems but it is in wonderful DTS. What is really weird for me is that I own a DVD 1982 aniversary concert on which Richie Blackmore throws a complete temper tantrum on stage making a complete ass of himself but weirdly the concert still comes off ok due to the stoic performance of keyboardist Jon Lord. The comments of the band taken after the performance gives you the impression they would never tour with him again. He did cancel all his Asian dates which had sold out & cost the band a great deal of cash. Yet they forgive, forget, and forge out yet another whole album and tour. This is the Perfect Stranger tour and they do five songs from the new album.

5944242,2,B00EUEWQ2W,"I saw the band on the Perfect Strangers tour in San Diego which was obviously after this Australian date. In the DVD, Gillan was weak, coughing and took til the end of the show to get warmed up. Blackmore, well, I don't want to go as far as to say ""sloppy"" but undisciplined to be sure.
Highly disappointing. I was hoping to see a show similar to what I saw in San Diego.
That show was comparable in musical quality to the Made in Japan album! It really was!! Complete with light show.
Gillan can out and screamed all night, Blackmore was tighter than anyone has ever seen him. Blew me out of my seat on ""Difficult to Cure""

Only the Zeppelin concert in '77 was better, but not by much. I bought the DVD and have only watched it once. Don't know if I will watch it again.",1399161600,2,771,4.174496644295302
5944243,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"Wow. This amazing DVD showcases Deep Purple at the peak of their powers ( and their status as the Rock Gods they were). Their amazing album, ""Perfect Strangers"" was a huge early 80's hit and a sellout tour followed. Back then, live shows were recorded on 16mm or 35mm film stock and it captured the rich colors and added a better viewing experience than early 80's cheap-ass videotape which would 'bleed' when the camera had to move or pan and the stagelights would streak across the screen. Purple is in fine form and Richie Blackmore shows why he's a legend in his own right.  ( Richie, could you please, please make an exception and appear on That Metal Show? Even by Skype. Your fans would be overjoyed and we would love it so much!) This DVD is a must have for any Classic Rock fan or for any music fan.

5944245,4,B00EUEWQ2W,"I'll preface my review with some background:

1970 First heard Deep Purple In Rock
1972 First time saw Blackmore live 20 feet away
1976 First time met Ritchie on Rainbow tour
1978 Attended the Rainbow King Biscuit Flower Hour Performance in Atlanta's Omni (utube it!)
1978 First time received back stage / on stage access through mutual friends in Rainbow and Black Sabbath
1984 Saw Perfect Strangers Tour in Worchester, MA and Cincinnati
1987 Saw House of Blue Light Tour in St. Louis
since -  Light correspondence with Ritchie's mother-in law /  production manager Carole Stevens
next - Will see Ritchie in Alexandria, VA May 20th for the first time in 27 years...

This Australian concert is unique for many reasons:  the lack of documentation at that time; the genuine comraderie between performers (even though Ritchie didn't attend pre-tour press conference, touche man-in-black); and there are many special moments not ever heard before where the band was not just on, but had something new to offer and any true Purple fan needs as much of those moments as they can get in confirming that, when on, they were perhaps the best live act in rock.

This was much better than the Paris 1985 recording that is out there and better than Blackmore's farewell ""Come Hell and High Water"".  I have to disagree with some reviewers about Gillan, sorry folks, his voice peaked in - are you sitting down - in 1972/73, he knows it, Ritchie knows it and you should know it.  It is painful, at times, to listen to him even here in '84, but I'll be nice and stop there.  Paicey is consistent, one of my favorite drummers ever. Glover does his job and Lord was a legend in his field.  Ritchie had my eyebrows up several times and that did not happen many times in the 80s. I was pleased for him, that this may have been his last gasp of happiness with MKII.  I read soon after they had to do Smoke on the water without him on one particular show.

Ritchie Blackmore, taken as a whole, is the greatest rock guitarist of all time.  Malmsteen has mind-bending speed - too much actually, as it gets in the way of his ability to write a lot of great songs. Jan Akkerman of Focus fame possesses versatility and skill beyond comprehension and never gets mentioned in the press. But Blackmore is it, at his peak, when he had the killer instinct - early Purple 1970/72, and when he got it again with early Rainbow 1976/78. Any footage of Ritchie is treasured, it has the potential of the past in the blink of an eye.  If you truly want to hear perfection listen to his guitar tone in Mistreated at California Jam 1974, his studio guitar solo of Child in Time of In Rock 1970, and the last time a tear came to my eye while listening to music?  The second guitar solo reprise of Catch the Rainbow of Rainbow Live On Stage 1976.  And the most outrageously dramatic sound of all time - it's only on youtube now...The opening 2 minutes of Still I'm Sad from the Atlanta Omni BBC King Biscuit Flower Hour concert and I was there in person to witness it.

The reason to buy this DVD: only one, there will never be another Ritchie Blackmore.",1395187200,,3112,4.5088967971530245

5944247,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"I saw this tour in Hawaii, which was had a bonus included in the show: the band called Hawaii, which was Marty Friedman's band before he joined Megadeth.  Anyway... the lights went out, and the audience was already going nuts, and then we heard the instruments revving up for their opening number, the incredible ""Highway Star""; I just KNEW I was going to be in for a rare and historic treat!  They played song after song after SONG--and ALL HITS... stuff that we grew up with!  Even the stuff from Perfect Strangers, which many of us were still familiarizing ourselves with, were absolutely top-notched.  ""Child in Time"" has got to be my favorite Deep Purple song ever, and Ian hit the nail on the head!  Blackmore went as far as getting on his belly lots of times to slap hands with those lucky audience members up front.  And Jon Lord's solo... my GOD!  He rocked his Hammond back and forth, causing an intense and deafening reverberation!  It looked as if Jon might accidentally topple his keys!  It's too bad that Jon's no longer with us, however, because he was THE quintessential Hammond Organist who had ever lived.  Although Ritchie was the undisputed leader of Deep Purple, I don't think they would've gotten very far without Ian Gillan, and ""Child in Time"" PROVES it.  They did everything I wanted to hear, perhaps more if you throw in the Perfect Strangers stuff into the mix.  For those of you who missed this classic Deep Purple lineup, the fabled ""Mark II"" lineup, I lament your misfortune because with Jon Lord's celestial discharge, we shall never again be able to experience the power that was the legendary Deep Purple.  It's like watching the Who without Moon and Entwistle, AC/DC without Bon Scott, Led Zeppelin without Bonzo, or Pink Floyd without Richard Wright (may they all rest in peace)... it just wouldn't be the same.  The music is tight, the band is HAVING FUN, and it'll bring you back to days of your youths (if you're 55 like I am, you'll know what I mean), when Rock wasn't tagged ""Classic Rock.""  Back then, Rock was ROCK, and if it didn't make your teeth rattle, it wasn't Rock.  In the present era of meaningless drivel, it's satisfying to one's own self that knowing the DIFFERENCE makes us stand apart from the blatant lameness of today's ""music.""

5944255,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"Deep Purple is my favorite band and I have seen them many times in concert and own, pretty much, every recorded concert film by the band. There is always something worthwhile in the shows, even if Blackmore wasn't in the mood or Gillan was having a bad night.

But this concert is something very special.  As one reviewer noted, the band has a chemistry that was rarely seen in the post 1984 reunion era. I have never seen Blackmore smile repeatedly in a show like this one. And his playing is stunning on several tracks. One of the best versions of Smoke on the Water and Space Truckin' ever captured on film.

Gillan's voice is pretty much 1970 hey day quality, which is even more unusual. Gillan has gotten better in recent years at working around his current limited vocal range. He doesn't have to do any of that here. The rest of the band does there usual outstanding work. Paice/Glover form a fantastic rhythm section and the late great Jon Lord never disappointed on the keys. Plus you get a great video of Lord rocking the Hammond Organ back and forth...that is a great moment!

If you follow the current version of the band (with Steve Morse on Guitar and Don Airey on keys) you will know they are great! They seem to share the same kind of chemistry consistently that is demonstrated here. Morse and Airey are consistently good. And Gillan's vocals are OK.

But the current Deep Purple will never be able to touch the fire of the classic Mark 2 line up when they played like this. Along with t this concert from 1972 [...] No show captures this remarkable band better than this Denmark show...and this concert is right in the same wheelhouse.

Much like the Denmark show, the director of this show does a terrible job with camera angles and often focuses on the wrong things. Bongo drums were added to give Gillan something to do during long solos. Why do these directors find them so fascinating? And no close up of Paice or keyboard shots of Jon. Just wrong.

Sound quality is good, but not remarkable. Video quality is the same.

But if you are a fan you MUST check out this jaw dropping performance. And if you are not, check this out and ask the question (How can this band, with over 100 million albums sold and with live performances like this NOT be in the Rock and Roll HOF?",1388102400,,2294,4.471291866028708
5944256,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"I saw DP on the Perfect Strangers tour at the Spectrum in Philly in February of '85, my third concert ever at the age of 14. I've been wanting to see a video of this tour forever, and the Paris '85 bootleg I finally got a few years back was a letdown because of Gillan's voice. I think it's from August of '85, and he sounds like he was getting over a bad cold or sore throat, like they maybe should have postponed the gig, it's that bad. I'm not sure if he had this problem beyond that show, but nonetheless, the performance I remembered most from the Philly show, Child In Time, wasn't even attempted.
  Which brings us to this release, from late '84, with the tour's setlist in its entirety. The video and audio are great! The sound appears to be completely live without any overdubs from what I could tell. Kudos! And the picture looks awesome, clear and sharp. I am watching it on a 36"" dinosaur non-HD TV however. As far as the camera work, I was expecting worse based on other reviews. Yes, the camera isn't always on who's soloing, but most of the time it is, and when the camera pans away it usually only does so briefly. And since it seems this show wasn't filmed for a release, (in house feed?) I was expecting a limited number of camera angles, but there are a good amount. The obvious omissions are cameras behind Lord or Paice.
  As far as the performance itself, it's very good. Highlights for me here are Strangers, Back Door, Strange Kind Of Woman, Lazy and Child In Time. Black Night and Speed King are also great, especially because I didn't recall those tunes from the show I saw. By reading some other reviews, I was expecting blatant overuse of echo on Child, but again, I have to disagree. There is some, but no more than you'd expect on such a long, dramatic piece. Of course it doesn't compare to being there in '85, but Gillan delivers here.
  This might be the most talented rock band ever, so they're always gonna be good, and this show is really good, don't get me wrong, but Ritchie isn't having one of his more inspired shows, and this DVD does his immense talent no justice. No knock on him at all though, what makes him so exciting to hear is his willingness to take chances artistically, and sometimes it just doesn't equate to greatness in the context of a live band, and more than a few times, this is the case here. I'm surprised (happily) that he allowed this release (if he even had a say). Not as big a deal is Gillan's voice, which is a bit creaky in spots, but nothing like the Paris '85 boot. I don't really think the Perfect Strangers album deserved 5 tunes in the set, but on the other hand, that LP would never again be represented live this much again, so it's nice to have a document of this tour the way it was, uncut.
  My honest review of the show would be 4 or 4 and a half stars, the group being simply so great that even when their guitarist has an off night, they're still awesome to hear and see play. But I'm giving it 5 stars because I think the more we support these kind of releases the more we'll get. If I had to rank DP DVDs, I'd say 1) History, Hits & Highlights. 2) Copenhagen 1972. 3) Cal Jam 1974 and then this one fourth.

5944272,2,B00EUEWQ2W,"I am a massive Deep Purple and have been since first hearing ""Deep Purple In Rock"" back in the day. In 1985 when the Purple announced that they were touring the world, I snapped up my ticket for the Knebworth show. I remember it being a stellar performance, however after watching this 'Perfect Strangers' live DVD I wonder are my memories of the Knebworth gig more to do with a transaction I had with a local hippy, than their actual performance. Certainly this show recorded in Melbourne is a real disappointment. Put simply after the opening track, 'Highway Star' it is downhill vocally, as Ian Gillan struggles with pretty much every tune, coughing his way through several numbers and on a couple of occasions missing his lines. The anthemic 'Child in Time' just does not cut it as Gillan's vocal sounds like it is being run through  some sort of processing, in order to mimic the majesty of the original studio performance.

Regarding the bands overall performance, it seems to lack groove and cohesion. For sure Blackmore, Paice and Lord have their moments, but such moments hardly make up for what is an underwhelming performance overall. As a musician myself, I can certainly understand how a band might under perform when the lead vocalist fails to cut the mustard.

I cannot understand how this DVD has received so many good reviews. I ask anyone to simply listen to its soundtrack and compare it with  the album 'Made in Japan' (on vinyl of course!) recorded in 1972. Such an exercise will reveal a band that sadly had seriously lowered the bar for this performance. I cannot understand how this DVD has been released with Ian Gillan's blessing, as he was undoubtedly one of the all time great rock vocalists, though this performance does little to support such a claim",1384041600,3,1780,4.76948051948052
5944273,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"Deep Purple MkII back again and in full form. Nothing or nobody can touch this band when they are all on the same page. In this show, being back together after many years and many side projects proves just that. They were tight, happy and firing on all cylinders. Just like back in the 70's, Ritchie and Ian were once again working on the same page. Nothing can come clese to Jon and Ritchie colaborating and improvising. Watching these two musical geniouses at it again was nothing less then a night in musical heaven for me seing them live back in 85 in upstate NY and after all these years, on an official release on DVD. This is one treasure Ill be watching over and over again. It's just too bad that this line up, for whatever their reasons, cant get over their personal differences and keep doing what they are so brilliant at. Even though Deep Purple are still at it and making relevant music today, for me a Deep Puple without Ritchie Blackmore is really not Deep Purple.",1384041600,,980,4.45

5944276,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"Well, I won't do an extensive song-by-song review, but suffice it to say that this is positively the BEST Deep Purple DVD that I've seen yet...I saw them on this same tour, back in Feb of '85 at the old richfield Coliseum, and this DVD captures all the intensity and energy that I remember from that incredible night...

I remember the band blowing the roof off the joint that night, and this DVD MUST be played in it's entirety to be fully experienced and appreciated. The DTS 5.1 mix, magnificent video and audio quality, and high-energy performance will chew you up, spit you out, blow you away, and leave you wanting more...Lol! :)

...I kid you not.

This lineup's unique chemistry is clearly evident here, while they were still having fun togetherThe show opens with ""Highway Star"", or course, and the first half will keep you captivated, no doubt...Then the second half, beginning with ""Child in Time"", with the echo-delay and timed harmonizer vocal effects done just right lends an atmosphere to the song like no other version you have heard or seen...unless, of course, that you saw them on that tour, as I did...

From there, the intensity level and top-shelf musicianship, tightness, cohesiveness and brilliant showmanship is sure to impress, as it builds and builds and finally explodes in audio and sonic majestic magnificence...

The bonus features a nice documentary on the tour, along with some interesting interviews and video clips...

This is to DVD concert films what ""Made in Japan"" is to records and CDs. IF you're a Deep Purple fan, and don't have this yet, what the heck are you waiting for? You just aged another day, fer cryin' out loud, heh heh...This one is essential. If you're NOT a DP fan, you WILL be after viewing this one.

Get the friggin' DVD, crank up the volume on your system, and
enjoy.",1383350400,24,1826,4.7594936708860756
5944277,4,B00EUEWQ2W,"What a treat to be able to see this show from late 84. Great interplay between Blackmore-Lord and Blackmore-Gillan and yes, Blackmore smiles a few times. A negative, as another reviewer mentioned, are excessive shots of Gillan playing bongos (more of Paice would have been nice) which really didn't add much to the song. Snippet lovers will hear JC Superstar during Strange Kind of Woman, Wish you a Merry Christmas, Fur Elise and the Jaws theme during Lord's solo, and Burn along with Jingle Bells during Speed King. A letdown was Blackmore's directionless solo during Space Trucking. All in all though, a very good show to have.",1383091200,,630,4.897196261682243
5944278,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"""Put your hands together and burn with Deep Purple!"" Although that comes from another show and a different line-up, you might as well because the band is absolutely on fire. The new songs mix well with the old and everybody gives it everything. Even Blackmore gets stuck in and the trade-off between him and Gillan in Strange Kind of Woman is a pleasure to watch.
I saw this band first in '74 and then again in '85 at the Hollywood Sportatorium. I remember nothing about it except that the band was in top flight so it's really good to be able to fill in some gaps.
Infinitely better than the Knebworth thing; Blackmore's playing here is so crisp and clear and Paice, Lord and Glover rock. Gillan does sound a little raspy but, even so, what a performance. Buy this one. It's not just for the completists, it's a testament to a band whose collective heart and soul are in what they are doing.
The tour ""documentary"" is ho hum but that's not what I bought it for.",1383091200,,962,4.410112359550562

I was a Fan since 1970 when I was 7 but as to young to go to concerts so I never got to see them until this reunion. Gillian, Pace, Lord, Glover, and Blackmore just tear it up on this DVD. It looks wonderful and sounds great. Its a great concert set and all Deep Purple Purple fans must have this.",1382832000,5,531,4.105769230769231
5944280,5,B00EUEWQ2W,This DVD proves that Deep Purple are the greatest live rock band in history.

5944281,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"I was not expecting much with this video. Although Purple is my fave band, I saw this tour live and was not impressed. The band was sloppy and not enthusiastic. Granted, the venue was terrible for a hard-rock ( DP is NOT heavy metal, folks) concert, but still. But I have virtually all the DP concert footage available and wanted this one. Boy, was I wrong. This baby is amazing. First, you do need to know that it is not HD. At times, especially with far-away shots, it comes across as shot as a VHS recording. But most of the time the footage is tremendous, especially of.......RITCHIE BLACKMORE. This is, for me, the most incredible footage of the magic and mayhem of the original Purple guitarist. Time and again we are given close-up views of him tearing up his 6-string. He plays a solo during ""Child in Time"" that is frenetic. But, later he plays another one during  an extended version of ""Space Truckin'"" that is positively incendiary. I was literally holding my breath at the sheer verocity of his playing. Other highlights: a terrific drum solo within ""Lazy"" from the unmatched Ian Paice, and kickin' renditions of ""Under the Gun"" and ""Speed King."" And maybe the most delightful item about the whole concert; they are all having fun, with themselves and with each other, including the infamously temperamental Mr. Blackmore. There are smiles shared, laughter, teasing, and nods of appreciation. I have NEVER witnessed these particular five men enjoying themselves on stage to this degree. The bonus documentary is interesting. And, in a hugely wonderful development, the sound is very impressive. I wish I would have been able to attend THIS concert of the tour, rather than the one I did. If you are any kind of Purple fan, especially of the MkII line-up, you absolutely MUST own this triumphant celebration of Gillan/Glover/Lord/Paice/Blackmore at their mind-blowing apex. Since there is not really any good video of the ""Made in Japan"" era shows, this is your next best thing. Oh, and for pete's sake, TURN IT UP!!!!!",1382572800,18,2031,4.8530259365994235
5944282,4,B00EUEWQ2W,"Good stuff with this release. There were some other Deep Purple shows (and clips of shows) from the 1984/1985 Perfect Strangers reunion tour floating around out there for years, on both bootleg and offical releases. However, either the quality of the bootlegs left something to be desired, or (in the case of the offical releases i.e. Live and Rare) it was only a few tunes and was taken from shows in 1985 where Ian's voice was a bit knackered. Some of my appreciation is a bit nostalgic, since I saw the band on this tour in Providence, Rhode Island in 1985 (had to smile when seeing this was the case with another reviewer): easily the loudest band I've ever seen live. However, even beyond this qualification, this 1984 show is a fine release. It's early on in the tour, so Ian is in fine vocal form. The band is spot-on. It's still fairly early on in the reunion, so Ritchie and Ian haven't yet burnt-out on the sight of one another and subsequently Ritchie AND Ian are both (as yet another reviewer said) making a real effort here. It must be said that Lord, Glover and Paice were virtually always consistently great live, but the difference between a good Purple show and a great Purple show post-1984 always seemed to rest on if Ian's pipes were up to the job and if Ritchie decided to apply himself on a particular night or sort of phone his performance in. Well, thankfully at this show on the dvd all 5 of the band are charging full-steam ahead. It's frankly nice to have a pro-shot gig in full with a crisp, clear mix from this tour finally made available. If you're a Deep Purple fan, you'll want this in your collection. 'Nuff said.",1382486400,7,1646,4.49
5944283,4,B00EUEWQ2W,"Finally almost 30 years after the release of Perfect Strangers we finally get to see Purple in all their glory..the band hitting on all cylinders here...Lord and Blackmore at their finest and even though Ian Gillan didn't have quite the range he had 12 years earlier on Made in Japan his voice still held up well (a far cry from the Nobody's Perfect release 2 years later). For those of us that the opportunity to see Deep Purple in '84-'85 this is an enjoyable trip down memory lane. The interaction between Blackmore and Gillan was great..in particular Ritchie actually looked like he was having fun ( yes those were smiles from the man in black). Are there issues here? Yes at times the camera work leaves a bit to be desired, certainly camera angles make Ritchie's guitar neck appear bowed and during Space Trucking Ritchie is obviously having sound problems but these are minor and don't take away from a stellar performance. This is how Deep Purple should be remembered, not the cabaret act they have become today.",1382140800,,1020,4.735955056179775
5944284,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"Very happy with the DVD purchase and a real dream come true for this long time Deep Purple fan. The video has a dated '80's look about it, but still, the power, charisma and excitement is all there in it's hard rockin' glory. If I had one gripe, it's that there was no camera (on keyboardist) Jon Lord's fingers. Unbelievable! That must have been the big mistake that kept this concert in the vaults for thirty years. Other than that, a very satisfying concert warts 'n' all, from the classic mkII lineup.",1382140800,5,505,4.5

5944286,5,B00EUEWQ2W,"Oh how long I have been waiting for this show to be released...I've seen the bootleg tapes before, but never the complete show. It's absolutely fantastic, but in a very weird, Deep Purple kind of way. Let me explain:

- If you want musical perfection - go and buy the albums. The band is very loose in this show. Both Gillan and Blackmore are in excellent shape, but it's also one of the first shows of the reunion and after the new album. They are both a little...how should I put this...rusty. Gillan forgets the lyrics here and there (but compensates with fantastic screams) and some of Blackmore's solos are very questionable. In particular the one during Child In Time - I feel that he got lost halfway through it and couldn't figure out how to get back to the melody. His solo on Knocking At Your Backdoor is also quite poor (especially compared to the Paris 1985 masterpiece), and it sounded even worse when it wasn't professionally mixed. The solo in Space Trucking, as with all the rest during those years, is quite...abysmal. Ritchie is just making noise. (I've had this suspicion for a while that he felt threatened by the new boy in town - Yngwie, who was getting all the praise for being so fast, and Ritchie wanted to respond...well he failed. That's just not the thing Ritchie does best).

But in the end...it's Blackmore! My hero. Even I can't get myself to praise his playing during this show.

However, you may spot all these flaws and dismiss the show. On a pure song by song basis, it is nothing special. But - play it from beginning to end, and you will start to understand what the magic of Deep Purple is all about! It's meant to be a little improvised, a little off the cuff, a little experimental. And then there is the whole vibe - as a show, in its entirety - this is fantastic!

Highly recommended!....just ignore Gillan when he plays the bongos (I always wondered...why does he do that? He is no good at it, you can often hear the off-beat bongo sound during a song. Did he think Paicey wasn't bringing enough power on the drums? Silly Gillan...let Paicey do what he does best and you stick to singing)",1382054400,2,2131,4.498708010335918
