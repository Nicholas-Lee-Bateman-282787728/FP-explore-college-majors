3788023,5,B001T46TBK,"The twists are many in this noirish tale of a bad love affair between a rich girl and a diamond smuggler. Complications ensue when a third party gets involved. A times comic and at the end, extremely dark, this Danish thriller hits all the marks and leaves you satisfied. I haven't enjoyed a recent foreign film this much in a long time. Catch this.",1254700800,,349,4.46875
3788024,5,B001T46TBK,"The filming, the score, the performances - all make for a great film that I find difficult to fully explain. A sordid tale of love, deception, betrayal, and above all: amnesia. Or maybe it is all about temporary madness, temporary passion and telling the truth. The Amazon description tells it best without revealing too much. There are so many twists and plot turns, that I thought it would become unbelievable, but they kept writing this piece in ways to make it beautiful, fun, terrifying and altogether enjoyable.

An unknown cast (here in America) fills all the requirements to keep this Danish thriller alive, but especially that of supporting player Dejan Cukic, he had a great screen presence as the police officer/best buddy. What struck me as most memorable though, was the filming and quality of effects. The crash sequence towards the beginning rivals any non-cgi event I have seen.

The story follows a married CSI-type police employee as he ventures into the realm of an amnesia stricken woman with a mysterious background. Through the course of events, both sensual and saddening at the same time, everyone's lives that are touched by the main character's faulty decisions, begin to unravel and feel the consequences.

This is bare bones DVD, but the sound and picture quality are good. The DVD cover art shows way too much of the final scenes, but in fairness they do show the ending of the film as the opening salvo of love stories. If it were rated it would be R for nudity, sexual content, language and violence.",1241568000,12,1531,4.85823754789272
8340417,4,B001T46TBK,"""Beautiful girl and the unsolved mystery - good starting point for a noir film"", mentions to the everyman Jonas, husband and father, the hero of ""Just another love story"", one of his friends, urging him to think twice before  immersing into that mystery. And soon, the movie turns out  a thriller in the Hitchcock's and Coen Brothers traditions with the main character taking  the sudden choices in order to run  from the stalled relationship that lost its initial appeal, from unfulfilling job, from life that leads nowhere to a romantic passionate love  and exciting new possibilities.

Derivative - that's the word that majority of nay-sayers use when commenting on this film. But its writer/director Ole Bornedal does not hide throughout the picture that he has made a noir film, or, rather, Neo-noir: Danish style that characterizes by postmodernist  self-reflection and  consciously  refers  to the works of past and present. There are all ingredients here you would expect in a noir film: twists, turns, wrong or questionable choices the main character takes and where they would lead him.  There are mysterious young woman with a dark past and a sinister stranger in bandages, gloomy deserted landscapes and long corridors with flickering neon lights.  The scenes of killings and beatings are rather cruel and violent, erotic encounters - explicit, and the ending is thousands miles away from a Hollywood happy ending. But for Ole Bornedal, the writer/director of the Just Another Love Story, the most important message that he wanted to convey to the audience was that everybody carries a dream and the need for a self-fulfillment in life - that life very rarely offers. His dark, violent, moody noir reflects on the wishes, fantasies, desires that seem have been lost as time goes on but never disappear and only wait patiently for a sudden spark to ignite them and to start unquenchable, all-consuming disastrous flames.

The film is over the top in its second part but by that time you have been already so involved in the story and glued to the screen that you are willing to forgive whatever problems and deep holes the plot has and how many films and books Just Another Love Story freely refers to. It could be described as Talk to Her While She Was Sleeping but remember not to mess with the Chinese Triads because this is No Country for Old Men. Ole Bornedal's neo-noir also brings to memory the mystery novels by French writers, the duo Boileau-Narcejac and Sbastien Japrisot. The former are the authors of the novels Les Diaboliques and Vertigo. Before they became the classics of cinema, they had been and still are highly popular books. ""Trap for Cinderella"" by Sbastien Japrisot tells about a young woman who has lost her identity due to amnesia in the fatal fire accident and does not remember anything  that  led to the disaster including the truth about being a murderer or a victim or both. The common feature of all mentioned novels and their screen adaptations is assuming somebody else's personality.  But No man is an Island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the Continent, a part of the main. And giving up your identity, pretending to be someone else, and  thus  accepting their connections with this world however mysterious, sinister, dangerous those connections may be, inevitably leads to the devastating results. It is just a guess  whether Bornedal is familiar with these books but the theme of Identity is the most prominent in his film, which is a riveting thriller, an impossible love-story, a social commentary on the middle-aged angst, as much as  a philosophical meditation on the possibility/impossibility to live someone else's life, and accepting your own.",1455235200,,3712,4.975728155339806

This one is excellent and satisfying in the wake of all the CGI infested Hollywood films of today.  The film has already been adequately rated by other reviewers, so I won`t add my comments.",1397088000,,293,4.615384615384615
8340422,4,B001T46TBK,"With perhaps more graphic violence than needed for plot, JUST ANOTHER LOVE STORY is an updated spin on classic film noir with moments of splendid cinematography, and the usual elements of gripping characters, identity confusion, dark and rainy streets, and narration.

8340424,3,B001T46TBK,"This was interesting to watch. It's really ""just another movie"" but it's worth watching if you're a big movie watcher like myself. It would have been better to rent this instead of purchase, but I purchase many foreign films just because they're not so easily available in the US and have enjoyed several Danish films recently, notably Adam's Apples, Brothers, and Pusher Trilogy, which are very good movies.",1286668800,,408,5.014705882352941
8340425,5,B001T46TBK,"This movie is Danish with english subtitles.  I enjoyed this mesmerizing film noir from start to finish and highly recommend this movie if you enjoy suspenseful thrillers and don't mind subtitles.

The movie started with three tantalizing glimpses of love and then moves into the movie itself, just another love story...  The brilliance of this set-up is revealed later in the movie.  This movie is full of artful touches and beautifully filmed scenes that make it a great find.  I also found it to be an unsettling combination of sadness and suspense.

The story revolves around a middle aged man who appears happily married but upon meeting a young woman, whose current hospital bed ridden state he feels partly responsible for, starts to question his 2.5 kids & white picket fence existence.  The rich young woman suffers from amnesia and he temporarily assumes her boyfriend's persona. But things get out of control fast and as he is sucked deeper and deeper into the young woman's mysterious life, his own life begins to crumble around him.  Which life does he really want?",1281571200,3,1078,4.917127071823204
8340426,5,B001T46TBK,"Jonas is a photographer who takes snapshots of corpse, is married, and father of two. His life takes another turn when he causes a car accident that leaves a woman a mysterious stranger. Feeling that he owes the woman and her family a debt of gratitude, he plays her abusive boyfriend Sebastian. He has fooled Julia's family into thinking that he is the one for her. They are unaware of who he is, or that of her real boyfriend. Jonas impresses her family immediately because of his affection for their daughter. All the while, his relationship with his wife slowly disintegrates.
Just Another Love Story, although a psychological thriller, illustrates what is seen isn't always real. There are dark patches that humans fail to examine until tragedy strikes. For Julia, it took a loss of vision to know had been gone what needed to be restored. Jonas was trying to put the pieces of her puzzle together but at a cost to his marriage and work. He, too, failed to see that what he was doing would hurt Julia's family. Just Another Love Story keeps the viewer at the edge of one's seat to see what happens next and keeps them guessing.",1279670400,3,1132,4.608910891089109
