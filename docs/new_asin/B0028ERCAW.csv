8356147,2,B0028ERCAW,The entire race was edited down to about 35 minutes. I wanted the entire race without comercials. Not what I thought I was getting. Very dissatisfied  and disappointed.,1425340800,,168,5.0
8356148,1,B0028ERCAW,"The DVD played for about two minutes and then became jumbled and frozen.  I ejected it and tried to play the DVD in another playing and it would not even read the it.  I installed it back in the original player and left it in on play until it finally began to play the last 12 minutes of the program.  When it finished, the DVD would not eject so I had to unplug the DVD Player and power it back up to remove the DVD.  The cost to carry it to a UPS center was not worth returning the product.",1385078400,,492,3.89
8356149,1,B0028ERCAW,I know the race was in 1985 but this copy of this race is terrible.  Also its not the whole race.  Just some long clips.  I don't know if it said that in the description or not but i don't remember it if it did.,1380672000,,211,3.6444444444444444

8356151,1,B0028ERCAW,This was very disapoining to pay 20 dillars for 45 minutes of a 3 to 4 hour race. Then they add a race from 2009 on the DVD I guess to add minutes. Will not trust this company or buy any product from them.,1311120000,3,205,3.6818181818181817
