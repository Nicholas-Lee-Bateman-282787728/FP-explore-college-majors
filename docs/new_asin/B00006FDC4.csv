8414560,5,B00006FDC4,"This DVD collection is a definite classic. It contains most of Nas' hits and other gems which he featured on, not included in his DVD collection released by his record label. The quality of this DVD is pretty decent and no logos appear through out the videos and image is clear. Although it seems as though videos were perhaps transferred from a VHS, the quality is still 4 out of 5 and each video is in complete time length. For those of you who are music video collectors, this is a must have.",1484006400,,495,4.333333333333333

8414562,1,B00006FDC4,"I received this dvd BUT there are some MAJOR COMPLAINTS. while viewing this dvd it CONSTANTLY jumps &/or has black lines that run thruout dvd, i was happy to get Janet Jackson included but what good is a dvd that cannot be watched properly. so this seller gets a 2 (fair) for distributing faulty merchandise. To Seller:>  ALWAYS preview disk before shipping to customers.",1291593600,,371,4.796875
