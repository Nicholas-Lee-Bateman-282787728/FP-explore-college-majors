1064480,5,6305669414,"Desperate people in desperate situations abound in Rod Serling's four scripts presented in Volume 15 of ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD series.  In ""Escape Clause, "" David Wayne stars at hypochondriac Walter Bedecker, who strikes a deal with Mr. Cadwallader (Thomas Gomez), a.k.a. the Devil, to receive immortality and indestructibility in exchange for his soul.  Of course, Bedecker soon realizes he has gotten a raw deal.  ""Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room"" features Joe Mantell as Jackie Rhodes, who has been ordered by a gangster to murder the owner of bar.  Knowing he does not have the guts to refuse the order and that he will be caught if he commits the crime, Jackie looks in the mirror and discovers looking back at him a DIFFERENT Jackie Rhodes, who is the better man he could have been and who now wants out into the real world.  Lois Nettleton turns in a wonderful performance in ""The Midnight Sun"" as Norma, who is trying to survive in her New York City apartment as the Earth moves closer and closer to the sun.  Of course, there is an ironic twist at the end of this tale as well.  Finally, there is Patrick Thomas McNulty (Richard Erdman), a man who does not know when to shut up in ""A Kind of a Stopwatch,"" based on an unpublished story by Michael D. Rosenthal.  The whims of fate, in the presence of a strange little man named Potts (Leon Belasco), give McNulty a remarkable stopwatch.  Press the button and time stops for everybody in the world except him.  Unfortunately, the man is not the equal of the gift.  One of the better theme discs in this series, these are all above average episodes of the Zone.",991180800,16,1620,4.551724137931035

7893699,2,6305669414,"Volume 15 of THE TWILIGHT ZONE provides four episodes (Escape Clause, The Midnight Sun, Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room, A Kind of Stopwatch), all of them annoying and depressing.  ESCAPE CLAUSE trods a familiar theme found in the Twilight Zone, namely, that of a character who sells his soul to The Devil.  This theme is also found in Printer's Devil (one of the greatest of all of the T.Z. stories) and in Of Late I Think of Cliffordville, featuring the actor Albert Salmi (his voice is harsh on the ears).  THE MIDNIGHT SUN has a theme very much the same as in a full-length movie called, THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE.  The Day The Earth Caught Fire is one of my favorite sci-fi movies. It stars the abundantly yummy Janet Munro (who also starred in Darby O'Gill with Sean Connery).  But as I said above, each of the four episodes is annoying and depressing.

But please don't get me wrong.  I am a fan of the black and white Twilight Zone series.  In fact, it would be accurate to say that my ""religion"" is the black and white Twilight Zone series of stories.  Immediately below is a list of T.Z. episodes that I've watched at least 25 times each.  Without these particular episodes, I would not be me.  For some of these stories, I provide a reason why the episode is important for me.  And below these, I provide the names of other T.Z. episodes that are charming and engaging enough to watch once every year or so.

NECESSARY FOR LIFE.
(1) Kick the Can.  This story, along with Walking Distance and A Stop at Willoughby are the most nostalgic of the T.Z. episodes.  If I was required to watch Kick the Can every week for the next ten years, that would be quiet fine with me.  I love Kick the Can.
(2) A Game of Pool.  Stars Jonathan Winters.
(3) What's in the Box.  This stars William Damarest, Joan Blondell, and Sterling Holloway.  Damarest and Blondell are a married couple.  They fight with each other just like my parents used to do in the 1950s and 1960s.
(4) One for the Angels.  This stars Ed Wynn.  This movie is soooo charming it almost makes me want to cry.
(5) Nick of Time.  Stars William Shatner.  Don't miss the other great episode starring William Shatner, namely Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.
(6) Mind and the Matter.  This stars Shelley Berman.  This T.Z. episodes speaks my own opinion about noisy workplace arrangements, for example, noisy workplace arrangement involving cubicles.  For this reason, and for perhaps other reasons, I find that watching Mind and the Matter over and over is my religion.
(7) Steel.  This stars Lee Marvin.  More than any other T.Z. episode, this teaches the virtue of continuing and persevering, despite adversity.
(8) Thirty-Fathom Grave.  This stars Mike Kellin as the mentally-deranged ""Chief Bell.""  This episode also stars Simon Oakland as ""Captain Beecham.""  I was amazingly and stunningly and pleasantly surprised to learn, this year, that Simon Oakland starred in THE SAND PEBBLES starring Steve McQueen.  I have no idea why I like Thirty-Fathom Grave so much, except that I am partial to submarine movies, such as RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP, CRIMSON TIDE, 1941, ICE STATION ZEBRA, and U571.
(9)  A Stop at Willoughby.  This stars James Daly as the overworked advertising executive.  The story reminds me of part of my childhood.  In this T.Z. episode, James Daly has repeated dreams during his trainride commute of returning to a simpler time, to living in a small rural town in New England.  Perhaps that is why I love A Stop at Willoughby so much --  because I was raised in the outskirts of New Haven, Connecticut.  At that time, I had some experience riding the same type of commuter train as featured in A Stop at Willoughby.  The ironic ending in this T.Z. episode is among the very best of all the T.Z. episodes, and is equal in greatness to that of TO SERVE MAN and TIME ENOUGHT AT LAST.
(10)  Printer's Devil.  This stars Burgess Meredith, Robert Sterling, and Pat Crowley.  It seems that actors Meredith and Sterling have greater rapport in this film than rapport between actors in any other film, especially in the scene where Sterling signs away his soul.  This scene really cooks!!!
(11) Person or Persons Unknown.  This stars Richard Long in the character of ""David Gurney.""  His last name comes from the fact that the character is being committed to a hospital.  Get it?  Get it?
(12) A Piano in the House.  This stars Barry Morse as the cruel theater critic.  And who cannot fall in love with Cyril Delavanti.  What a delight is the Cyril Delavanti character in this T.Z. story.  Cyril Delavanti also plays a delightful character in A Penny for your Thoughts.
(13) A Penny for your Thoughts.  This stars Dick York.  Dick York has charmed millions of Americans with his starring role in INHERIT THE WIND, starring Gene Kelly, Frederic March, and Spencer Tracy.
(14) Time Enough to Last.  This T.Z. episode is so great that I quivver with humility at the thought that I might types few words about it.  It stars Burgess Meredith as the incompetent bank clerk, who had the luck to marry a nagging wife.  The nagging wife played by Jacqueline deWit.  This character is strident in the same way as the wife of Gunther Toody, in CAR 54 WHERE ARE YOU.  The ironic ending is one of the greatest of all ironic endings in literary history.
(15) The Fever.  This is about a man who initially harbors the notion that gambling is immoral, but who becomes converted to a gambling addict during a trip to a hotel that has gambling machines.
(16) Cavender is Coming.  This stars Carol Burnett.  This is one of the ""workplace situation"" T.Z. episodes.  It seems that I love the T.Z. episodes that feature ""workplace situations"" the most.  The ""workplace situation"" T.Z. episodes include, Stop at Willoughby, Mr. Bevis, Printer's Devil, and Mind and the Mater.

CHARMING AND ENGAGING.
(1) Walking Distance. Concerns nostalgia for childhood.  I have plenty of that, since my grandma was the best of the best of the best of the best of the best, and because I had lots of friends from the years 1955 to 1960.
(2) To Serve Man.  Although To Serve Man is one of the greatest of the greatest of the T.Z. episodes, for some reason I only watch it every three years, and not more often.
(3) The Shelter.  This stars Larry Gates who plays a doctor.  The plot is about a false air-raid warning about an attack by Russian missiles.  Larry Gates also performs in YOUNG SAVAGES.  YOUNG SAVAGES is one of the greatest films in history.  It stars Burt Lancaster, as well as Telly Savalas (Telly Savalas also starred in the T.Z. episode, Living Doll
(4) Third from the Sun.  This stars Edward Andrews, who was so delightfully creeping in another T.Z. episode, You Drive.
(5) You Drive.  Concerns a hit-and-run driver and the fact that he is haunted by his own automobile.
(6) Living Doll.  This stars Telly Savalas.  This is a great ""starter Twilight Zone"" episode that is suitable for introducing children of the age of eight or nine to the T.Z. series.
(7) Mr. Dingle the Strong.  Stars Burgess Meredith.  Not to be missed in this T.Z. episode is Don Rickles.  Don Rickles also has a part in RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP, one of the greatest of the greatest of movies.
(8-22) Okay, now I will just list the titles of the rest of my favorite T.Z. episodes.  They are, Sixteen Millimeter Shrine, Prime Mover, Mr. Garrity and the Graves, Might Casey, Caesar and Me, Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, Night of the Meek, Mr. Bevis, The Silence, The Dummy, Big Tall Wish, Night Call, A World of Difference, Judgement Night, Purple Testament, and Monsters are Due on Maple Street.",1512259200,,7602,4.638680659670165
7893700,2,6305669414,"This episode didn't just make McNulty annoying to the other characters, they made him too annoying to the viewers too. It was the wrong choice of type of character for a plot such as a stopwatch that stops everyone and everything except the watch carrier. McNulty was too unlikable to make his adventures with the watch really enjoyable. Everyone at his job and his local bar couldn't stand him, because he was such an oblivious to the extreme nonstop motormouth.  He did not know the difference between getting noticed and getting liked and was too hard headed to listen to anybody but himself. McNulty was more blabbering and annoying than the chatterbox in TZ ep ""The silence"" who had to remain silent in a room for a year. It would've been better if they'd used McNulty for that episode and the chatterbox from there here. But better yet, I'm not sure why it was necessary at all to use an annoying blabbermouth for an episode about a watch that stops time. Actually, it holds up and distracts the story.
The watch itself idea was a great idea though, stopping time so the watch carrier can move around and psych out those around him such as others in the room being baffled on how a man can suddenly change from one side of the room to the other in a split second. That, and many great ideas that can be used with such a watch. This could've been a great episode. But not enough good ideas were executed well here. They showed us McNulty stopping the watch, moving, but then walking back to the same spot before pushing watch and resuming time. They did show us a split second move from one place to the other side of the room when it was just McNulty and the bartender, but even that was played more quick and dull then it could've been. Other ideas, such as McNulty stopping the watch and moving a base on the baseball field saving an out for the home team, they should've shown us that, not just have McNulty tell us. McNulty had received the magic watch from a friendly heavy accented bar customer, and the only character in this episode that liked him.
SPOILER BELOW
Then the bank robbing idea, instead of them showing us seeing if McNulty could really pull off and get away with robbing the bank, they instead showed us McNulty dropping and breaking the watch and McNulty now freaking out because he couldn't get people moving again. In McNulty's case though with what everyone thought of him, it's probably a good thing that he couldn't.
The watch breaking permanently idea and the outcome of everyone permanently frozen is actually a good one though, they just should've had that happen after we saw the outcome of McNulty robbing the bank.  The watch dropping and breaking bit had a sort of similarity to the Twilight episode ""Time enough at last"" when Burgus Meredith dropped and broke his glasses.
This episode's plot was also a bit of a reference to Twilight episode ""Elegy"" with someone's reactions to frozen unmoving people.
I kind of liked the part when McNulty first started freezing things and we see several different pictures of streets, cars, horses, etc. stopping frozen. I know that they were each stolen from previous films. One I recognized, the jet skiing picture, was taken from the Esther Williams film ""Easy to love"". I own that film and watched it numerous times.",1510444800,,3297,4.624573378839591

7893703,5,6305669414,"David Wayne is excellent in ""Escape Clause"" from the First Season. Written by Rod Serling, David Wayne plays a man who makes a pact with the Devil for immortality. He tries cheating death several ways and it is always successful and gets unexpected results when he goes for a try at the electric chair. A bit of irony from The Twilight Zone.

""Nervous Man In A Four Dollar Room"" is a classic episode of sorts. Joe Mantell is very good as a man who faces his own demons in a mirror. It is from the Second Season written by Rod Serling.

Lois Nettleton gives a very moving performance in ""The Midnight Sun"" from the Third Season. Written by Rod Searling, the Earth has gone out of orbit and is being slowly drawn into the sun. There are devastating droughts, heat waves, and general panic as mankind is apparently doomed.

""A Kind of Stopwatch"" is interesting. This is from the Fifth Season and was written by Rod Serling. It is a bit of a fanciful episode as a man finds a watch that can stop all motion on earth.",1421107200,,1012,4.372340425531915
7893704,4,6305669414,"Volume 15 in the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series features four of the better episodes that any fan will want to add to their video library. Good stories and good actors makes for a good DVD.

""Escape Clause"" starts out the disc starring David Wayne as Walter Bedecker. Walter is a hypochondriac who is always sure he has what ever bug is going around and always calling the Doctor. Walter in fact is healthy as a horse but he won't believe it. Convinced he is going to die of some kind of illness wishes he could have immortality. Next thing you know there is the devil himself ready to make a deal with Mr. Bedecker to give him what he wants. Walter doesn't think about the consequences of making a deal such as that with the devil until it is too late.

The next offering on the DVD is ""Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room""  starring Joe Mantell as Jackie Rhodes. Rhodes is a scared little man who has been given an order from the local gangster to kill someone. Mantell doesn't want to do it. But he is too scared to tell the gangster no but also too scared to do the deed. What can he do in such a situation? Mantell will find the answer when he looks in the mirror.

""The Midnight Sun"" is probably the most well known of all the episodes on this disc. It is certainly a memorable one. The Earth has been taken out of its orbit and is now moving closer to the sun causing unbearable heat. It stars Lois Nettleton in a memorable performance. And just as it looks like the world is about to burn up a great twist to the ending.

The last story on the disc is  ""A Kind of a Stopwatch"". Patrick Thomas McNulty, played by Richard Erdman, is a man who loves the sound of his own voice. He never shuts up when talking to someone so people can't stand him. Then one day he meets a man named Potts, played by Leon Belasco, who gives McNulty a special kind of stopwatch. It can freeze time at any point McNulty wants to with the press of a button then unfreeze it. McNulty thinks this is the best thing he ever got but then he had never gotten anything before in the Twilight Zone.

If you have been collecting the volumes from the ""Twilight Zone"" DVD series this is one volume you will want to add to the collection. Would also make a good introduction DVD for anyone not familiar with the series.",1414972800,,2285,4.227064220183486
