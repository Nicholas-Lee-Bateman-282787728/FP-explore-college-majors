Every other dvd player in my house,including the blu-ray player,wouldn't play it. So I ended up having to get a multiple region dvd player for it. However this dvd has some rare drive-in movie trailers, which I couldn't find in some U.S. movie trailer compilation dvds,so that was another thing I liked about it. Unless you own a multiple region or region free player besides having a PC you will likely need to buy a region free player.",1363305600,2,599,4.454545454545454
8493728,4,B00666UF16,"I have grown a love for terrible movies.  But, some are quite unbearable to get through.  So, GRINDHOUSE TRAILERS CLASSIC 3 has some great little introductions to movies that you wouldn't normally see.  There is a certain flare and charm to these 2 minute odysseys, but to watch over 50 does get a bit numbing.  But, this DVD (PAL VERSION) has some cool stuff on it.  I enjoyed the entire series (3 in all) as I get these little nuggets and spared their FULL blown presentation.  Granted, there are a couple trailers that intrigued me to check them out in their entirety.  But, most not so much. So, if you like trashy TRAILERS then give this disc a spin.  My head is still spinning after what I witness.  Schlock!!!!",1362873600,,717,4.496124031007752
