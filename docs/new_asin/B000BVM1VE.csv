2442758,4,B000BVM1VE,I remember these from childhood and they are just as good as I remember. My daughter cannot get enough immediately after watching The Greatest Adventure Stories From the Bible: The Miracles of Jesus she asked to watch it again. I've found them to be very close to scriptures and even having the teenagers transported back in time doesn't detract from the stories. I only wish all the ones I remember as a child were available on DVD.,1345420800,,433,4.636363636363637
2442759,4,B000BVM1VE,Another video that is great for the kids and grandkids.  I can highly recommend it to parents and grandparents for this reason.,1343520000,,127,4.7727272727272725
2442760,5,B000BVM1VE,"My wife and I grew up watching this series, and we wanted to share it with a girl's orphanage in Haiti, so we purchased any we could find with French language or subtitles. The videos are now with the girls who love such Biblical cartoons.",1334188800,,239,4.333333333333333
2442761,5,B000BVM1VE,This video was exactly what I wanted. I remember watching these bible stories as a child and it helped me understand the written word the Bible.,1334188800,,144,4.576923076923077
2442762,5,B000BVM1VE,"I wish they would hurry up and do a box set of all these, or at least release all the titles in the series. ""The Greatest Adventures of the Bible"" is a series made by Hanna-Barbera for television many years ago. There are a ton of titles on VHS and only a few on DVD. Even though they are only 30 minute episodes, the studio chooses to release one title per disc. David and Goliath from this set is also really good. The premise of the series is that 3 young teens are on an archeological dig site in the middle east, when they discover a tomb door that sends them back in time. So they land in different biblical episodes and interact with people like Noah. It sound weird, but it is actually fun to watch the kids in the different stories and how it affects them. They do not always know what part of biblical times they are in until later in the story.  It may sound realistic but it plays well. If you think about it, if it happened what would you do? Learn and help out of course and that is what these kids do. In the story the teens meet Noah and his family as they are constructing the ark. They chip in and help out. It shows the pressures put on them by the local people that harass Noah during the project, and how that affects his own family. When the rains come, it shows the hard work of taking care of the animals and the ark itself during the flood, as well as the fate of the people who jeered at Noah when the flood hit.
The stories are entertaining, well animated, respectful and I recommend.",1266969600,25,1511,4.156996587030717

2442844,4,B000BVM1VE,"Yea they came out with a DVD of the movie.  The movie was good, not quite to what the word of God teaches.  God shut the door.  My students had learned that and so was a good lesson to always go back to see what the bible says and not take everything for what men teach us.  So was another way to train our students.",1382486400,2,316,3.8153846153846156

2442849,1,B000BVM1VE,"I bought the video to supplement my Sunday school lesson.  I was horrified at the inaccuracies of the story. The ark had 11 persons in it instead of 8,and it leaked terribly. That is contrary to the Bible story - I am so sorry that I was swayed by the reviews in buying this video as it cannot be used for the intended purpose.",1365811200,7,327,4.109375
