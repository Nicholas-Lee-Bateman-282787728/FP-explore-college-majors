8124611,5,B000FL7C96,"I used to watch this show around 20 yrs  ago with my elder brother in my old home after school...  God !  Will Smith became an instant idol....

He is this country kid who is sent to his aunt's (Bel Air) place by his mother 'coz of him getting into trouble in his hometown Philly.....The guy is truly a ikon and deserves his own show.....

The versitality , siulliness, humour  and the DANCE.... man !  you will love his dance.... in the few episodes in which he does dance...

You gotta love it !!!",1311984000,,499,4.23404255319149
8124612,5,B000FL7C96,I have always loved The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and now I can watch it whenever I want to.  I love these dvd's.,1292544000,,111,3.8260869565217392
8124613,4,B000FL7C96,"I've started watching Fresh Prince reruns on TV with my wife since she never got to experience this show when it first aired in the 1990s (she grew up in a developing country). While I liked the show as a kid, I'm loving it as an adult. One of the great things about the show is that it stays PG for the kids, but pushes close to the edge in subtle ways for adults. For example, the show has some goofy moments, which will appeal to kids. However, the show's funniest moments come from the more sophisticated jokes or references to pop culture that kids might not get (such as Will calling Carlton ""Arnold Schwarzen-negro"" right after the latter had pumped iron at the gym). Smith is a genuinely funny actor (in my opinion one of the best actors around), and the rest of the cast is superb. I can't wait for the rest of the series to come out on DVD.",1251936000,2,850,4.253086419753086
8124614,5,B000FL7C96,The first four seasons are absolutely hilarious. where are seasons 5 and 6???????????? if anyone can fill me in please do,1220918400,,121,4.809523809523809
8124615,5,B000FL7C96,"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is still funny and family friendly many years after the show's run on NBC.  It's worth it to own the seasons on DVD whether you are part of a Black family or of some other race.  Many family issues come up throughout the show's run - from a young urban man transplanted into suburbia and trying to adapt, to sibling rivalry, to teenage sexuality and dating, to school/academic issues and college application, to career choices and ethical dilemmas, to marital conflict and possible divorce - and it is great to watch the young teenage Will grow into  college student and ultimately a newlywed!  The show, of course, wasn't just about young Will, but the Banks couple, their extended families, Will's absentee father, young Ashley growing up, Carlton...even the butler -each and every character was the main subject of an episode at some point.  A SOLID INVESTMENT YOU WILL ENJOY FOR YEARS TO COME.",1215216000,5,921,4.840764331210191
8124616,5,B000FL7C96,"I think this show is amazing and it is very very funny.  Will Smith is very talented and since this show he has done serious acting and he is a good role model for the whole world.
The cast is superb and behind the mask of shallowness there is a great message hidden too.
And now...  I Quit, I Quit, I Quit !!!",1195776000,5,310,3.9047619047619047
