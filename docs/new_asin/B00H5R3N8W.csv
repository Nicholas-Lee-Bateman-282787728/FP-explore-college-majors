6133695,4,B00H5R3N8W,I really like this video. It was very enlightening. But I can also see why others say it's just about China. There's more information on Chinese culture then on the connection Chinese ppl have with Jewish people. But the information they do have is interesting.,1398211200,,261,4.822222222222222
6133696,5,B00H5R3N8W,"It's very interesting to watch this 30-minute documentary, at the end it relates original Chinese people with Jewish Lord by the way they created their original characters engraved on the oracle bones thousands years ago.",1397692800,,221,5.3428571428571425

6133699,1,B00H5R3N8W,"First half was educational. Second half prozelytizing. I did not like the fact that the video went from providing historical and caligraphical data for sudden propagandizing of af a physical being as a god of some kind. If that is the case why not worship trees? But, off course, that would be idol worship. Watch first half. The moment you hear names of dieties, close it.",1396396800,18,373,4.666666666666667
6133700,3,B00H5R3N8W,"There is so much to Chinese history that this video seems to fall short, merely by way of being under an hour long.
This will most likely be of greatest interest to Chinese peoples who are open minded about religion, and it is a moderately enlightening watch for anyone else.

I have absolutely no problem with the connection this film tries to make with the ancestors of the Chinese people and the Bible, however, I feel a documentary should show other opinions and ideas of origin, and that more time in the film should have been taken to cement their point. As it stands, it almost seems like quotes and factoids are cherry picked for use in this film, and that is the biggest reason for a 3 star rating to me. A longer film that covered more history and made a more detailed case for their point would have been much more worthwhile.",1395705600,4,837,4.435064935064935

6133728,1,B00H5R3N8W,This film is absolute garbage. It is deceptive. It starts out purporting to talk about the origins of Chinese civilization but really is just religious propoganda trying to show some connection between Chinese classical culture and the Bible.

6133744,5,B00H5R3N8W,"This is an evangelical Christian film, demonstrating how Chinese language and culture are related to biblical themes, events, and people. So, for me, an evangelical Christian, this was a surprising, wonderful movie. The first part of the film is secular in nature. In the latter part, however, the real message comes through clearly and eloquently. It is well-made but viewers who are not Christians or who are not interested in seeing a Christian film might be disappointed. The movie-makers should have identified the film as such in presenting it. Otherwise, some viewers will feel ambushed. Nevertheless, I hope all will watch the film. It's a good documentary that even non-Christians might appreciate if they have an open mind.",1445904000,6,733,5.220338983050848

6133746,4,B00H5R3N8W,"While I fully empathized with most of the reviewers who felt ""cheated"" into watching what they felt was Christian propaganda, but, is the fault entirely the producer's that this film is classified by Amazon as ""Chinese Movies""? I beseech Amazon to revamp its classifications!!! I stumbled upon this well-made docu-film, and also many Tai-chi, Qigong, medicinal cooking and Chinese massage etc etc instructional videos while searching for Chinese Movies!

Yes, the title of this film could be clearer, as suggested by one reviewer - ""Who are the Chinese? A Christian perspective"", but anyone who reads the synopsis and watches the trailer must expect religious content, read the first line: Is there evidence for ancient biblical origins in the Chinese culture?!; and last words: ...spiritual roots of the Chinese people. Also, with the length stated as 38 minutes, really, it is obvious that this is not a movie but a short film or documentary. I would call it a docu-film, since it did fall short of being an unbiased documentary.

It is also apparent that most of the viewers are not familiar with the difference between Chinese as Chinese nationals (as in the citizens of the country, China) and Chinese as a race of people. This docu-film is not about Chinese nationals seeking its roots and cultures, it is about Chinese immigrant descendants living in the Asia-Pacific region making sense of traditions and practices of the Chinese race that seem mythical and folklore-ish. None of the interviewees in this docu-film is a native Chinese. They are Chinese from Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Australia. If you know the Southeast Asia and Asia-Pacific regions, you would appreciate that the Chinese in these countries grow up and live in a confluence of Western education and culture, new national identities and the traditional practices and beliefs of their race. Seen from their perspective, it must be enlightening to discover how the Chinese language and traditional practices and beliefs could have been influenced by ancient historical events recorded in the Middle East, and how their faiths could be linked to who they are as part of the Chinese race.

I gave it 4 stars as it is well produced and researched, but not without factual errors. Good animations and original music, but the narrator did not pronounce the Mandarin words accurately, it is not easy to find a Southeast Asian who is 100% fluent in English and Mandarin (spoken Chinese) at the same time, as Mandarin is not so commonly spoken in Southeast Asia. (Hong Kong uses Cantonese, different from Mandarin/Chinese). The script should be tightened towards the last quarter of the film, clear portrayals of the interviewees finding linkages between their faiths and the traditions that have baffled them would have made this docu-film more complete, instead of simply recounting how they come to faith.

All said, do watch this with an open mind, and skip the testimonies if they bother you, but gain new insights into the Chinese, ancient and modern.",1443225600,,3048,5.09

Using a question about the origin of the Chinese to preach about  Christianity may be justified in the minds of some televangelists, but the end product (propaganda) will never justify the means (lying), as Confucius, Plato and Abraham would say. Certain missionary groups may not understand deception is manipulative and coercive and enjoy proselytizing with a Bible and a plunger.

I was just researching China for a unit I am writing for my students and this documentary started off with some great background information. Then suddenly it was trying to justify Christianity as the sole religion, which I found irrelevant to the content of the initial premise. I understand religion has a large place in history but these were first hand accounts of people of Chinese decent explaining their being saved and finding Jesus. It just didn't seem in keeping with description of the film, nor the information presented in the first half of the documentary. It lost credibility to me.",1426723200,,719,4.901639344262295

6133793,1,B00H5R3N8W,"If one could cut out the last half of the film, it might be shallowly acceptable as discussing perceptions, history timeline, inventions, and evolution of Chinese writing.

Then it goes berserk...

""Understanding how words were formed in Chinese script gives other insight into the ancestral roots of the people.""
This is illustrated by setting it against the backdrop of the bible, an ancient book written by the Jews three thousand years ago.  The Jewish people lived in the middle east with no external contact outside that region until the seventeenth century.  This meant that the Chinese and the Jews would have no knowledge of each other prior to that time.""

It totally goes away from Chinese history at this point into Judaism and Christianity and tries to tie in Christianity with China through examples of Chinese writing and references to Chinese wise men.  It makes a loose reference to DNA research of Chinese originating from Africa.

With the statement of the isolation of the Jews from the Chinese until the seventeenth century, at that point the film lost me.
According to Wikipedia:
1. History of the Jews in China: ""Jewish settlers are documented in China as early as the 7th or 8th century CE.""
2. Christianity in China:  ""Christianity in China has a history going back to the Tang dynasty (8th century).""
3. Silk Road:  ""...beginning during the Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD).""
4. Islam in China:  ""Islam in China has existed through 1,400 years...""",1407888000,5,1470,4.91497975708502

8630311,2,B00H5R3N8W,"This was a deceptive infomercial about Christianity.  The title itself gave Christians a bad name as non-Christians will claim how Christian missionaries are using this video to convert Chinese people to be Christians.  The film was a fine film in terms of how well it was put together and how someone decided to extrapolate Chinese characters to have Christian meanings.  The problem is that most people watched this film based on the title to learn about Chinese people, not of Christianity and the Bible which is what this documentary did.  Such deceptive behavior only makes people think that Christians use deceptive tactics to convince people to believe in Jesus.  One would think that Christians would be good people to not use deceptive behavior to convert people.  This was just plain wrong.  Any Chinese person trying to learn Chinese culture and history would find this film offensive, especially being that Chinese people are mostly not Christians and most Chinese religions do not believe in one God.  Chinese religions tend to believe in multiple gods/deities similar to the Greeks.

The first 10 minutes of this documentary was actually enjoyable as it had very good videos and narratives to explain various holidays of the Chinese culture and how far back in history the Chinese have written documents, and the evolution of various dynasties in the Chinese history.  It then transitioned into talking about the Chinese language and writings.  I got absorbed into it as it was very interesting to see how words are formulated like pictographs of the Egyptians.  Even when they linked the Chinese writings to Jewish bibles, it was okay.  However, then they started to go into the various parts of the Bible and using Chinese words as justification for how the Chinese philosophers were talking about Jesus without saying so; that's when it got ridiculous.  They then claimed that Chinese prayers uses three of everything, which has the Christian meaning of the ""three"" who bear witness in heaven: the Father, Jesus and the Holy Spirit.  Um, the reason why the Chinese uses threes in most religious ceremonies is because Chinese are very superstitious when it comes to homonyms, as the number three has the same sound as the word for birth and new, so often the number ""three"" is symbolic of such things and has a good luck feel to it that is used in religion often.  Chinese people bow three times to any god or ancestral spirits, and it has nothing to do with Christianity.

For a Christian, this film would deserve 5 stars.  To a non-Christian trying to learn about Chinese people, they would give this film one star for misleading viewers about what is expected in this film.  To someone who is trying to be open-minded about what was good in the film vs. what was bad in the film, I give it 2 stars.
