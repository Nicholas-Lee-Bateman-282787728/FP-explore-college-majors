8481176,5,B003Z3QEGS,"I have a librarian's sense of references reverence.  No other resource that I have found concerning (my ""retirement""-2nd career of) massage (I used-to-be-a-math-teacher)... has the grace and precision that this DVD has illustrated.  Paul Lewis - ""Registered Massage Therapist from Canada""... don't let the unconvincing credentials cause you pause, nor bring you doubt.  Canadian MTs have over 4 times the hours of training than most US MTs are required to have.  But not counting hours THIS IS the grace, the blessed healing touch, what we are striving for, the connections, the body mechanics, the rhythmic touch, you know your MT clients will open up to their healing potential under a touch based on this gifted teacher.  AWESOME.  I am so grateful for this DVD, I wish I could thank Paul Lewis personally.",1311120000,3,809,5.090909090909091

This video really helped me to see exactly how to work on someone sitting up without tiring myself out and getting great results for the client!,1236988800,3,299,4.60377358490566
