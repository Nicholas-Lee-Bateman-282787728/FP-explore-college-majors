8441928,1,B004UOHNB6,"The content I rate Maximum stars ****, however I give one star due to the packaging, which barely stacks all four disks on top of each other. The top disk barely fits on to the DVD case post. I had to purchase a seperate case holder, which holds four disks seperately, which of course adds to the over all costs in purchasing this product. As before with the Sony TOHO release, the company (this time Warner Brothers)pulled a ""fast one"" on it's customers. Any amount of money that you spend, no mater what the product or service may be, it is an investment.
This form of ""DVD holder"" destroys that investment quicker. The same can be said of the DVD holders which have significant areas missing (or punched out) in either the front or back (or both)of the case.  When a customer makes a purchase, that producing company receives money to invest back into it's enterprise so that it can make a profit. It should ""NOT"" do so in a disrespectful manner to it's customers. If I had known of the packing before hand I would ""NOT"" have made this purchase. I do ""NOT"" support either dishonest or disrespectful business practices. Such practices are not in the best & healthiest interests of our communities and our country (& our families). Yes, I do feel strongly on this subject. So, should ""YOU"" !
Buyer beware :(",1310774400,29,1308,4.56595744680851
