2816214,5,B000PC704M,"In 2007, a pair of television documentaries aired concerning the brilliant career and courageous battle for life by Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro.

This production by NBC Sports is narrated by Bob Costas. The documentary is split into seven sections and has bonus footage. It features full coverage of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes & Barbaro's five races that sparked his run for Triple Crown immortality.

The interviews are with the individuals who are most associated with the champion; trainer Michael Matz, jockey Edgar Prado, owners Roy and Gretchen Jackson and veterinarian Dr. Dean Richardson.

The nearly 13 minutes that closes the documentary - The Recovery and Barbaro's Legacy - clearly demonstrates why this story will continue to resonate amongst people who hardly follow Thoroughbred racing. The inclusion of letters to Barbaro is especially touching.

This is a wonderful tribute. Barbaro will remain forever's champion due to his will to live and the trust he placed in others, on and off the track.",1216598400,4,1030,5.262195121951219
2816215,5,B000PC704M,"Barbaro was a courageous horse.  He was a champion right from the beginning of his birth, and all the owners knew it.  He had that special winning vibe and appearance that people knew would make him a legendary horse, and a Kentucky Derby winner.

I want to say something else.  People always talk about Barbaro having the opportunity to be the first triple crown winner in 20-something years, but not being able to accomplish that because of his unfortunate leg injury.

Let me tell you something- more people are aware of the Kentucky Derby, which Barbaro won, and to me, that's more important than some extraordinary triple crown achievement.  It was wrong for my local news to put most of their attention on the triple crown aspect of Barbaro in the horse racing event, instead of the fact he won a really good race in the Kentucky Derby.  THAT is what we will remember Barbaro for, and we'll also remember him for his amazing ability to run past all the other horses on the track without breaking a sweat.  A truly talented animal.

What proved he was unlike other horses was when he realized he was injured, and instead of jumping around and being hard to control (like other horses) he just stood perfectly still and let the doctors examine his injured body.  Barbaro was almost human the way he acted.

Get this DVD to see what the big deal was about with this amazing horse.",1211587200,3,1383,4.58130081300813
2816216,3,B000PC704M,"NBC sports documentary on Barbaro from interviews with his trainer, jockey, owners and vet.  Factual and somewhat dry given the emotions generated by the tragedy of this beautiful racehorse.",1203206400,,190,5.551724137931035
2816217,5,B000PC704M,"I believe everyone loved Barbaro. We all were so devastated when he got hurt. And we watched his progress as he healed. But then he lost his gallant battle & we all mourned. This is an excellent DVD about Barbaro. Anyone that loved him, should buy this.",1199491200,2,253,4.404255319148936
2816218,4,B000PC704M,"I'm a horse lover & racing lover.  This movie nicely captures the spirit of Barbaro, the love of his owners, his struggle to beat the odds.  For those of us who have also lost horses we love, you can't help but tear up.",1194739200,,219,4.069767441860465
2816219,5,B000PC704M,"We continue to be completely satisfied with the excellent service we receive through Amazon.com and its affiliates. Everything is sent quickly (usually ahead of the estimated delivery date), cleanly, in excellent condition, and exactly as advertised. Thank all those involved with this process.",1181520000,4,294,5.8604651162790695
2816220,5,B000PC704M,"I had to watch this first by myself so I could get all the tears out of the way and then I watched it with my 8 year old daughter and STILL cried, as did she.  The documentary begins at the end, the day Barbaro died, at the press conference with the Jacksons and Dr. Richardson, explaining exactly what went wrong and why it was felt that it was just time.  Then Barbaro's story is told, by a host of people from those who were at the farm where he was born to his trainer, Michael Matz, his jockey Edgar Prado, other racing afficianados, and of course the Jacksons and Dr Richardson.  It also rips to shreds the rumors, spread by those who had no clue, that the motive for Barbaro's extrordinary care was strictly financial.  It shows the incredible love that his owners had for him.  A love that was not only shared by his owners, trainers, jockeys and those in the racing world but a deep love that eventually was shared by people all over the world.  This film gives you a sense of what Barbaro not only could have but in my opinion would had achieved had fate not interviened.  This is also shown in the bonus features of all five of Barbaro's races leading up to the Kentucky Derby. There is also footage of the Jacksons discussing the lithograph of the foxhounds in their living room that gave them Barbaro's name, plus a short snippet of his full brother, Nicanor, a yearling colt who will begin his career in 2008.  The only disappointment is that they did not tack on the footage of his new full brother, born April 20th on the DVD.  This was shown at the end of the version that ran on NBC May 5th after the Kentucky Derby.

  This is a MUST have for all Barbaro fans as well as anyone w/a love for horseracing and even those who aren't racing fans.",1179878400,24,1760,4.3
2816221,5,B000PC704M,"This is the first of two documentaries (the second is to air on HBO in June) that tells the bittersweet story of a horse that captured the heart of a nation last year. Even the casual ""once or twice a year"" horseracing fan has to admit that the story surrounding the 2006 Kentucky Derby winner tugs at the heartstrings.
We were astounded by his brilliant Derby, devastated by his subsequent Preakness nightmare, amazed by his sheer will to live, and lastly, heartbroken by the news of his death. The world rallied behind this champion the entire summer and fall and into the winter, and this is the story of those events.

It starts at the end, really - beginning with the day owners Roy & Gretchen Jackson and Barbaro's surgeon, Dr. Dean Richardson, explained why they couldn't go on, and the decision to euthanize was made. The story then goes into detail about the events that came together - the trainer's brush with death in a plane crash and the heroics surrounding it, his Olympic glory, the owners and the story behind Barbaro's name, the birth of Barbaro and his astounding feats on both turf and dirt leading up to the Ky Derby, and his unfortunate mistep in the Preakness Stakes.
It then switches gears to the story of his gallant battle to beat the odds - his lifesaving surgery and healing, the table-turning laminitis, and his deceiving progress which in turn ended up meaning the loss of one of the best horses the world has seen in nearly 30 years.

It brings back all the emotions of joy and fear, hope and sadness - that horseracing is so full of. Barbaro's courage and will to live captivated the world, and not just the horseracing community. It serves to remind us that fame is fleeting, horseracing is full of the highest highs and the lowest lows, and as Gretchen Jackson so rightly said- with love comes grief.  But when you have a horse so beloved as Barbaro, it is worth it.  So is this DVD.
If you are an avid horseracing fanatic, it will bring tears to your eyes, again.  If you are just a casual follower or fan, it still will. Trust me.

He could have done it. The caliber of Secretariat from my perspective. Such a sad loss for horse/racing fans.  I will watch it again.",1402704000,,296,4.267857142857143
8190526,4,B000PC704M,"This horse was a wonderful Champ. It broke all of us animal lover's hearts when he passed.
HBO did a much more indepth documentary. Much more on trying to save him. Much more on the people behind the horse. Much more moving of a film. But I am happy to own it.",1356307200,,260,4.019230769230769
8190527,1,B000PC704M,"I ordered this DVD thinking it would be the same one I had seen about a year or two ago.  This one was not the same!  The one I saw originally was much longer and went into much more detail.  I specifically remember seeing a scene where Barbaro's jockey was describing his last stretch of the Derby, and the line he said, ""OK,""les"" go!"" was not in this one!  I LOVED watching that one particular scene because Barbaro HAULED ASS!  It was simply magnificent to watch.

Several scene I remember from the first DVD were shortened or completely missing: the winner's circle celebration was much shorter, Barbaro's transit from the track to the hospital much shorter, the treatment at the hospital was not as detailed because I remember Barbaro being placed in a sling to get him into the whirlpool was not as detailed.

I suggest you skip this edition and try to find the COMPLETE edition with all the uncut scenes.  This was such a big disappointment.",1355011200,2,948,4.601190476190476

8190529,5,B000PC704M,We had been trying for ages to purchase this DVD and we are so glad we found it on Amazon.com. This is a fantastic DVD which shows all Barbaro's great races and his courageous fight for life after his tragic injury in the Preakness.

8190530,4,B000PC704M,"Barbaro was a horse with the heart of a champion. His win at the Kentucky Derby was spectacular, and captured the attention of horse racing fans everywhere. Two weeks later, when he pulled up lame at the Preakness and the decision was made to nurse him back to health, I along with millions began to follow his recovery. Through the first several months, I sought updates on his condition every day. As his condition improved and it seemed like he had a great chance for survival, I still checked in on him every week. Eventually things took a turn for the worse.

This film does a good job of chronicling Barbaro's struggles, as he cooperates with his doctors and trainers in an attempt to get healthy. Importantly, it also shows the love of his owners and everyone around him and how the decisions were made about continuing his treatment. It is unlikely any film can come close to fully representing all the feelings I had, or all the hopes and prayers of people around the world who sent him get well cards, made him posters and checked in online every day, but it did bring all that back in my memory. I don't think I could ask or expect more than that.",1287532800,,1158,4.462264150943396
