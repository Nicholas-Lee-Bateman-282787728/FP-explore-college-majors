8054041,5,B0007YLIW8,Love this movie! It is great for ages 6+ as a fun family movie. It follows the classical story with wonderful special effects and dancing scences. The love story is very light hearted and not mushy. Boys will like the manly Beast appearance and costume. Girls will love Beauty's costumes too!,1236643200,,292,4.745098039215686
8054042,5,B0007YLIW8,"I saw this movie on dvd at sams club and I just had to have it.  Beauty and the Beast is my favorite story.  Since I got it Ive watched it over ten times a day.  I just went and saw disney's Beauty and the Beast on broadway and it was nothing compared to the costumes, senery, music, and songs that are in this movie.  I promise you that all people of all ages will fall in love with the beast just as I did when I was three and a half.",1130112000,,436,3.7065217391304346
8054043,5,B0007YLIW8,"I showed this wonderful movie to my children about thirteen years ago  and tried unsuccessfully for years to find our own copy.  I was delighted to find it had been recently released as a DVD.  The best part of the movie is the final scene (20), where lovely Rebecca DeMornay and handsome John Savage, dressed in marvelous Renaissance wedding clothes, sing a perfect love song to each other, ""If You See with your Heart."" Savage's marvelous voice blends wonderfully with DeMornay's. This is one of my favorite songs of all time because of the depth and compassion of the lyrics, combined with a moving and memorable melody.  The lyrics are so outstanding and beautiful, that I had written them down years ago and still have them.  This is a delightful children's movie that I'm proud to share with my five chidren.  Thank you, John Savage, Rebecca DeMornay and composer and lyricist of the love song.  God bless you and your loved ones.",1128816000,,936,4.7407407407407405
8054044,5,B0007YLIW8,"OMG! I adore this movie. My parents taped it off tv for me way back when. I still remember the whole thing! Would someone please put all of the canon movie tales on dvd! They made the best faerie tale movies of the 80's! Of all time as far as I'm concerned. They had excellent acting, good plots, and catchy music that still sticks in my head even after years of not hearing it. Please! Oh Please put these movies on DVD!!!! I've met sooo many people recently that remember these movies well and we all want to see them again!!!!! Please put them on DVD!!!!",1116720000,3,557,4.264150943396227
