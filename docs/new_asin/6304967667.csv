8560740,3,6304967667,"This one's pretty good.  Ranma suffers a head injury via Akane's fists and has a change of heart.  He now thinks of himself as a girl, wears women's undergarments, treats Happosai like a human being, and gets excited by  clothing stores.  There are a couple memorable scenes, one of which  involves Ranma-kun (male Ranma) holding a brassiere up to his chest and  commenting on how cute it would look on him.  The second episode isn't  so great.  I didn't really catch its point.  Something about fighting  Happy's partner in lechery, or something.  Anyway, the animation is  good, the dubbing is mediocre, and the humor is, of course, wonderful.",944784000,,645,4.861111111111111
