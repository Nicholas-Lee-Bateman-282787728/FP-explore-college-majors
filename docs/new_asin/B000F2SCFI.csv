8116709,3,B000F2SCFI,"This dvd is WAAAAAAY overpriced for what it is, during the yoga exercises the actors in the films aren't actually doing the circuit with you. They literally start the position then pause the tape while keeping the music going, this may not matter to a lot of people, but personally i prefer it if the actors weren't as lazy as this. Now the music, the music during the routine is wonderfully peaceful and relaxing...the incredibly loud noise to indicate its time to switch positions however is incredibly annoying and makes it virtually impossible to truly relax during it. There are some good things however. There's a section on the main menu where you can practice the routines and it also tells you the translations, basic instructions on how to perform them, how each moves helps your body and what people shouldn't do them. If you have trouble doing the americanized versions of yoga (like my girlfriend) than i highly recommend this tape, if you don't, go buy something else. Seriously.",1376611200,,993,4.847058823529411
