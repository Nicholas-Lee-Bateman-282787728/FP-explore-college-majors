8008812,1,B00019JRJK,"Listen, I had the vhs of this from when I was a little kid and its pure unfiltered nostalgia to me. However this is horribly out of date because the game of course has changed dramatically in formats and newer types of cards that have naturally came WAY after this videos release, etc. So if you are looking to buy this as a teaching tool it is not the best way to say the least and if you are learning how to play just find a updated tutorial on youtube or somewhere else online as there are now many alternatives. Also if you do decide to watch this anyway you can probably find it streaming free on youtube. I hope this has help you and the best of luck with the game.",1386720000,,671,4.090909090909091

If you havn't purchased the first two of this series, SCHOOL OF DUEL-NEW DUELIST & ADVANCED DUELIST, I strongly suggest you do.
Though not mentioned above, this video instructs you how pick cards that will work and be in harmony with each other in your deck or, rather, compliment each other. I watched this once and must admit, there is so much information here I want to watch this over and over. Even if you think your an advanced player; ( Like I thought I was) there is something here for you to learn.
This is a great series That I'm so glad I purchased it.
