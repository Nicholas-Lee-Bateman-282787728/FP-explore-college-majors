6491531,5,B00LMBUR7W,"Love this season! My favorite season of all (apart from Mighty Morphin, before the power transfer) I wish this was it's own box set instead of two separate ones, but I got this for $12, so it was worth it!. I am waiting for the first part to drop down from $14.99.",1413676800,4,264,4.096153846153846
6491532,5,B00LMBUR7W,as the Rangers continue to search for Zordon Dark Specter the grand monarch of evil continues to drain Zordon's power and it all leads to one epic two part final battle of the Rangers and the universe vs the United Alliance of Evil. Can evil be stopped? watch and find out.,1412985600,2,273,4.372549019607843
6491533,5,B00LMBUR7W,"Like I sad on the Vol. 1 review, I'm not sure exactly what episodes are on here since there are 43 total, so I'm sot sure exactly where it continues off from the first volume. My guess it's the last 21 episodes of the season. As I stated in the previous review this is arguably the greatest season of Power Rangers ever, and this half of it may be the reason why.

There are 2 big things to in this half: The first is the Psycho Rangers saga. This saga is legendary for Power Ranger fans because this is one thing fans always wanted to see, real evil Power Rangers and this saga delivers above and beyond. The saga is takes up 8 episodes total and shockingly the Psycho Rangers saga even continues into the next season.

The other big thing is the ""Countdown to Destruction"" finale. This was not only the finale to the season but was the overall finale to ALL of Power Rangers up until this point. All of the forces of evil from all the seasons team up to try and take over the universe. And this is a very elaborate and dark invasion of Earth.

If you're not sure which seasons to purchase this will be one you will hear quite a lot from a lot of Power Rangers fans.",1405468800,6,1167,4.177777777777778
6491534,3,B00LMBUR7W,"This season rocks, but it is cheaper to buy the box sets then all the volumes. Time life is greedy. All they  want is your money. Do not fall into the trap of money hungry people.",1404864000,2,179,3.9722222222222223

8666634,5,B00LMBUR7W,One of the best Power Rangers series ever despite this is a very long season!,1505779200,,77,4.2
8666635,5,B00LMBUR7W,"""Power Rangers: In Space, Vol. 2"" picks up where volume one left off, with the Space Rangers searching for Zordon while Andros, the Red Space Ranger, learns that Astronema is his sister, Karone, and begins trying to bring her back to the side of good. Dark Specter ramps up his plan to take over the universe and launches the Psycho Rangers against the Space Rangers. All of this builds to the two-part season finale, ""Countdown to Destruction.""
This season was one of the most ambitious for Power Rangers and the second half continues to deliver. It features drama, romance, pathos and much more. ""Always a Chance"" brings back Adam, the black Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger and later Green Zeo and Turbo Ranger, to give Carlos, the black Space Ranger, some advice. It's a nice throwback to see him morph one last time. The two-part ""Dark Specter's Revenge"" is one of the most heartbreaking because of how the showrunners portray Andros' pain. Further, the way Dark Specter threatens the Earth with an asteroid is a far greater challenge than usual for the Rangers and really ups the tension. ""Carlos on Call"" explores what happens when a Rangers' identity is discovered. The season finale, intended as a series finale, not only wraps up the outstanding storylines from this season, but also from the previous five seasons of Power Rangers. Every past villain appears again, the Rangers face their darkest moment, and Bulk and Skull get to be the heroes they always wanted to be in a moment evocative of ""Spartacus"" (1960). It does not disappoint as the end of an era and the Rangers go out on a high note.
While Power Rangers continues to air to this day and is currently in its 24th season, this remains one of the best episodes and seasons of all time.",1505433600,,1753,4.73202614379085
