8740645,1,B017TK0GCU,"It is too bad truth in advertising does not apply to movie titles.  This movie would then more accurately have been named ""FLABBY UNATRACTIVE TOPLESS WOMEN ON THE MOON.""

It was recently discovered that the script was actually written by a twelve year old.  The male actors are in reality fourteen year old boys, with a ten year old's acting abilities, dressed and made up to look like adults.  The visual effects were produced by a couple of eight year olds.

VERY badly done photography and visual effects -- Even if they didn't have CGA when the movie was produced.  The color was so washed out in all of the outdoor sets (which is most of the movie), it was almost in monochrome.

This movie is a TOTAL waste of time and money unless you enjoy using DVDs for frizbees.  I'm sure I have seen worse movies, I just can't remember when.  The only reason it rated one star is because it was not possible to give it less.",1460246400,,919,4.390532544378698
