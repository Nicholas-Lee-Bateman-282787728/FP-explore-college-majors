8133785,2,B000GPPPOU,"In terms of substance, it's just like an audio book. The narrator tells the story from the beginning till  the end. The video clips are very brief. Each is about couple minutes long. Therefore, they don't show enough details about the Romans' clothes, armors, etc. The same problem happens to the Barbarians. The fighting scenes are very short too. They fail to give me a feeling of the battles. The video is blurry and looks washed out. It seems it was transferred from tape to DVD. Its shoestring budget is clearly exposed.
As another reviewer said, it covers the Romans' invasion of Britain. So the barbarians mean only the people living in Britain at that time.

This DVD has 2 advantages.

1. There are some maps which help me understand the story a little better.
2. They interviewed an authoritative person on this subject, Dr. David Chandler from Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. I guess that makes their information dependable.

In short, it's boring. I prefer to read a book with illustrations than watching this.",1344211200,,1025,4.873563218390805
8133786,4,B000GPPPOU,"The title of this video ""Romans and Barbarians"" is, perhaps, too grand for the scope.  (And perhaps too grand for a fifty minute treatment).

Principally the video covers the Roman invasion of Britain, and the barbarians of the title are the Celts who inhabited the island.

Visuals are good.  The principal ""interviewee"" is a professor of miitary history at Sandhurst and the video includes discussion of Roman military organization, weapons and tactics. The time covered is from the reconnaisance in force by Caesar through the invasion of Claudius, and up to the suppression of the resisting tribes.

Worth the money, as long as you understand the scope",1197072000,3,656,5.093457943925234
