5177531,4,B008P76XCY,"Although it may be one of the most popular works of contemporary opera, you aren't going to see too many productions of Gyrgy Ligeti's only opera, Le Grand Macabre due to its demanding nature and its limited appeal to a rather specialised opera audience.  So when the Liceu in Barcelona (with La Monnaie in Brussels and the ENO in London) decide to put on a rare production of the work and go as far as to make a world premiere video recording of it, you can be thankful that the challenge of finding an appropriate look for the all-important visual representation of this work has been given to La Fura dels Baus, the experimental Catalan production team perhaps most in tune with such an unusual work and capable of relating to its status as an ""anti-anti-opera"", which is not quite the same thing, as you might imagine, as just an opera.

Le Grand Macabre most certainly isn't ""just"" an opera, but it is one that fully exploits the full range of dramatic, musical and singing opportunities for expression that the medium is capable of.  Often dissonant and cacophonic, it's not however unmusical and indeed is made up of quite expressive musical passages and ""quotations"" that draw from a wide range of classical influences that demand a certain musical virtuosity, creating a complex soundscape of musical language and sonic textures.  The singing in particular is extremely demanding, full of flourishes and vocal gymnastics in near-impossible tessitura.  The difference between Le Grand Macabre and this kind of musical expression in other Ligeti compositions lies however in the visual and dramatic nature of opera, which is equally if not even more important for this particular work, and in that respect this extraordinary production, spectacularly imagined and directed by lex Oll of La Fura dels Baus with Valentina Carrasco, enables the viewer to experience the work in its fullest expression.

With its end-of-the-world theme, lex Oll appropriately seems to choose to set the production of the Liceu's Le Grand Macabre during the few seconds preceding the imminent death of an overweight woman - seen in a short video introduction - who has enjoyed the excesses of a Big Mac-abre junk-food feast and is lunging for that last pizza slice when she suffers a heart attack.  A huge model of this woman in her death throes dominates the stage, her face contorted in agony, those final moments and the excess that has clearly been part of her life, drawn out and encapsulated within the surreal and nightmarish situation depicted by Ligeti through the operatic medium.  The huge splayed naked body revolves 360-degrees between the four scenes of the two acts and is clambered over and dissected in a disturbing fashion, with a wiggling tongue, detachable nipples and other moveable parts and orifices that the characters delve into and appear from.  Costumes too are cleverly designed to suggest body parts, organs and musculature.  Technically, with the impressive use of projections, it's a theatrical tour-de-force by La Fura dels Baus, but more than just spectacle, it's a brilliant interpretation that adds further levels of resonance and involvement to a work already quite rich in symbolism and suggestion.

I don't think this work could be performed in any other way than with complete abandonment of any sense of propriety or dignity - and perhaps even comprehension - but it does demand extraordinary discipline on the part of the singers and commitment to the unusual methods of expression that Ligeti resorts to.  The English diction isn't always perfect here with some of the Spanish members of the cast, but it's hardly the most important consideration.  That's not a problem for Barbara Hannigan, but her challenges lie elsewhere in the vocal exertions that are demanded from her in the roles of Venus and Gepopo.  She not only handles these with astonishing facility, but also with verve and character, as difficult as the roles must be to play.  Similar commitment and flights up and down the vocal range are called for from Chris Merritt as Piet the Pot and Frode Olsen as the Astronomer Astradamors, but really, there isn't anyone in this cast who doesn't impress on a number of levels in how they rise to the challenges presented by this work.

Undoubtedly a production that it would be better to experience live in the opera house, Le Grand Macabre nonetheless comes across very well on the small screen.  It's very well filmed to focus on the details of the performance, while keeping you in mind of the larger picture that, in any case, would be hard to ignore.  The quality of the High Definition Blu-ray transfer is excellent, the 2-hour work fitting comfortably onto a single-layer BD25 disc, the image quality near-flawless, handling the darkness of the stage lighting well.  The audio tracks are a vital aspect of the whole experience and they come across well in both the PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 mixes.  The BD also includes a good in-depth conference-style Making Of feature that has all the key players in the stage production discussing the development of the ideas, influences and technical considerations behind the concept, and an interview with Michael Boder on the musical side of things.  The BD is all-region, full-HD, with subtitles in Italian, German, French, Spanish, Korean and Catalan.",1347235200,26,5351,5.003378378378378

I also thought the staging was vulgar. Why replace a fantasy landscape with a womna's vagina and bowels?

8529427,5,B008P76XCY,"Whew! I first heard this bizarre opera on the original 2 CD release. It is a stark and startling apocalyptic romp through an end-of-everything scenario. Now that I have seen this Blu-ray release, I am even more startled. The staging is just mind-boggling, with the main set including a giant naked woman from whose various orifices characters enter and exit. A warning...the language is frank and shocking, with some words I never heard used in an opera before! Jarring and a joy to watch, this is a worthy addition to anyone's modern opera collection. I highly recommend it.",1372723200,8,575,4.877551020408164

8529429,4,B008P76XCY,"Gyorgy Ligeti wrote his opera ""Le Grand Macabre"" in 1977 and revised it in 1996. It is based on the play of the same name by Belgian playwright Michel de Ghelderode. Essentially the title is also the main character - a ""grim reaper"" whose real name is Nekrotzar ('czar of the dead') figure who enters the town of Breughelland during its apocalyptic last hours - or so his grim announcement goes. As the narrative progresses, we see figures from the town who represent various forms of human debauchery; almost a complete roster of the ""Seven Deadly Sins""  Various characters illustrate drunkenness, sexual excess, greed, abuse of power and so forth.  The catch is we see - in what the playwright considered a satire - that the merchant of death may be deluding and fooling himself while mankind goes on (as is revealed very near the end.) In the opera, and in this performance, the roles that seem the most well sketched - nearly caricature - are a self absorbed but weak king, the town drunk and a lustful couple (in this case portrayed by two women....)  Musically this is said to be a turning point for Ligeti whose music I do admire but it is still angular, mostly atonal and complex; although not ""difficult"" to listen to.  This video production from the 2011 Liceu production is visually intriguing but I must offer a caution: This is certainly not going to please everyone. The first and second acts both begin with video of an uncredited female actress exhibiting some pretty slovenly behaviour and apparently getting violently ill. The actress submits herself and her body (dressed down to her underwear) in very unflattering fashion. Kudos to her for the courage to act degraded. The staging by Alex Olle (""La Fura dels Baus"") is wildly creative and shocking - the focal point of the stage is taken up by a gigantic nude female figure that closely resembles the actress in the video by Franc Aleu. Onto the giant body - that rotates at key points in the narrative - are carefully and artfully projected film footages of starry nights, visions of hell, skeletons and skulls, even sexual foreplay at one point. What the giant figure represents is not clear except possibly a larger than life canvas onto which can be shown apocalyptic visions and symbolism of debauchery but the most controversial and potentially offensive moments are the actors/singers climbing on her, entering and leaving stage through her mouth, her eyes, her anus and her vagina. Her entire backside is removed at one point and some secret police remove her entrails so that her body cavity can now be a scene' a bar at one point. It is actually visually stunning at some points as lights shine upward through the giant eyes while visions of a form of Purgatory are projected onto the body but all of this is bound to shock and offend some viewers (Make no mistake, this is visually and - occasionally, textually - an 'R' rated opera).  The performances really are good, most notably Brian Asawa as Prince Go-Go and Barbara Hannigan who must perform the most difficult of soprano gymnastics in a dual role.  Adventuresome viewers who do not get offended easily as well as fans of Ligeti who appreciate his role in modern music will admire the amount of work and talent went into this. Everyone else ..... be advised. (There is a very fine Sony audio recording of the opera with Esa-Pekka Salonen that I much admire and gives a very good ""view"" of the work itself minus the staging that I heartily endorse)",1352160000,23,3486,4.734761120263592
8529430,1,B008P76XCY,"With my keen interest in contemporary opera & as a long-time admirer of Ligeti's music, I looked forward to viewing & hearing this, his only opera.  I expected music that would challenge & excite me with the ecstasy & density that characterized the Ligeti music I knew, & was prepared for, as well, the grotesque & surrealistic qualities of, for example, his ""Nouvelles Aventures"" (a quotation from which he wrote out for me when we met & conversed during his 1973 visit to Toronto).

Well, ""Le Grand Macabre"" is certainly grotesque & surrealistic, but there's little of ecstasy or density to be heard nor, other than in the orchestral interludes, any sustained lyrical lines. Instead, we are presented with a series of crude, unfunny vaudeville sketches sung in choppy parlando fragments by a cast of mediocre vocalists (with the sole exception of the remarkable coloratura Barbara Hannigan).

Ligeti's libretto is based on an early example of ""Theatre of the Absurd,"" & the real star of the show, for better & worse, is the absurd but brilliantly-constructed set - a super-sized replica of (most of) a woman's body, from whose orifices (mouth, nipple, vulva) characters emerge and into which they exit. I could suggest all sort of metaphors for such entries & exits, but I think I've said enough already about this disappointing combination of uninteresting music & sophomoric theatrics.",1350086400,12,1389,5.056768558951965
