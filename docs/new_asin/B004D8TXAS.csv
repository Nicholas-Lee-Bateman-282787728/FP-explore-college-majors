8425003,4,B004D8TXAS,Interesting match. Everyone was for Siegel when it started and eventually came to realize Efren was the best. Unfortunately we get to hear Mike cursing in the background. I don't know why they let that stay on the DVD because it takes away from his stature as a professional.,1496966400,,275,4.63265306122449

8425005,3,B004D8TXAS,"This was a good match to watch for those wanting to see two champions in action however it was not one of  Mike speigal's best performances. In fact, he appeared a little nervious and was not shooting his best. I have much respect for Mike however this match really let me down. Even Reyes appeared not to be at his best. So I was not impressed with either player but it was nice to see two champs in action. You can probably watch all or some of this match on youtube and judge for yourself.",1306972800,,492,4.178947368421053
