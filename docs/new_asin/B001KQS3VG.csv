8315929,5,B001KQS3VG,My kids really enjoy this videos. This little guy is funny and the cartoon it's ok for different range of ages maybe from 1 to 4 years old. My 5yrs old kid it's not too much interested in Noddy as he was some years ago. The delivery was fast.,1373932800,,242,3.9591836734693877
8315930,5,B001KQS3VG,I purchased this for my three year old grandson and he really enjoys it. The stories are fun and there are many teaching moments. This is completely different than any of the other cartoon type movies he has. I think that as far as our three year old goes this borders on being a little to young for him. The animation is wonderful and the colors are so vivid. There is an entire series of these cartoons. I do highly recommend them!,1361318400,,433,4.2926829268292686

8315932,5,B001KQS3VG,"We were introduced to Noddy and Friends on the Sprout channel, which no longer airs the British show. Our then 2-yr old daughter fell in love the first time she saw it. Even our 8-month old triples (2 boys and a girl) take notice of the show when it was on the TV. We bought the set of 5 DVDs from Wal-mart, which did not include the book. The stories are ~ 10 mins long each and all are educationally based on social situations like sharing, good vs naughty behavior, cooperation, telling the truth, and even counting. The DVD sets also have a 3-4 minute segment in between each story called Say It With Noddy, during which the children are introduced to foreign languages and sounds not normally spoken in the English language. This helps with learning other languages later in life. The animation and colors are outstanding. The characters are engaging and easy for the young to identify with. We highly recommend this fun set - even the adults enjoy watching with the kids.",1278720000,,977,4.588571428571429
8315933,4,B001KQS3VG,"This Noddy isn't as fun as some of the others, Miss Pink Cat
is irritating as she makes Noddy drive her here and there
through toy town, I don't remember the other stories. It's
Noddy though if your kids like him.",1270512000,,213,4.219512195121951
8315934,5,B001KQS3VG,I ordered this for my nephew he is almost 2 and he just loves noddy I wasn't able to see him open it but I was on the phone and for a little guy that doesnt know my name he sure knows how to say noddy. He learns alot while watching noddy and I think noddy is his favorite person in the world.,1263168000,,292,3.6507936507936507
8315935,5,B001KQS3VG,"I very highly recommend all Noddy books and dvds. They teach desired attributes like honesty, caring, sharing, reliability, kindness, etc.",1258416000,,138,5.95
