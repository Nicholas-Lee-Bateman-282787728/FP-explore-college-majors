8503038,1,B002MPQIF2,"This ""DVD"" does not play on a DVD player.  My top-of-the-line Sony DVD player (in 1998) says to ""insert disc"" when this DVD is in.  Perhaps it's a ""burned"" disc and not a ""pressed"" disc.

  I had very high hopes in seeing this film once again as I had seen it on PBS when it was originally released.  It was, to me, a very interesting film and this DVD has left me disappointed.  -  Thursday  26 August 2010.",1282780800,3,408,4.128205128205129
