3503557,5,B001C19HNM,"A stimulating debate from two Oxford leaders in their field (Dawkins, biology, and Lennox, mathematics and philosopher of science).

However the style was too segmented, with little chance for lively ongoing interaction. Instead, the ""Judge"" opted for five minute responses on a particular theme from The God Delusion book, starting with Dawkins, then going to Lennox.

This kept leaving Dawkins exasperated - and trying to provide a response out of the five minutes he had for his next question. The fact that this production was also being broadcast to a TV schedule also made it a hurried procedure.

Either way, excellent arguments on both sides - though it can be seen that the argument Lennox puts forward is much weaker than Dawkins, despite what the BBC has to say on the matter.

Lennox rarely touches on why there IS a God, merely kept negating points about why Dawkins things there isn't. Denying the negative doesn't leave you with a positive.

Another side note: this whole DVD and production is actually sponsored by a Christian organization, although they are keen to point out they haven't been bias in it's production. Generally, great DVD - well worth the money.",1243382400,18,1180,4.969543147208122

3503561,5,B001C19HNM,"If you're interested in this product, chances are that you've read The God Delusion or are at least familiar with the work of famed Oxford Professor Richard Dawkins.  You may also be familiar with his precedent of not entering into any debates with opponents of equal status, stating that he does not want to give the opposition ""even the air of credibility.""

In this event, Prof. Dawkins has stepped outside of that precedent, though, which is what makes this DVD so utterly unique.  Nowhere else does Prof. Dawkins offer himself to the fire of opponents in the same way that he does here, and it makes for a very rewarding and intellectually stimulating experience.

Professor Dawkins and Dr. Lennox are both from Oxford and have both had lengthy and prestigious careers.  Both are well versed in their fields and have a great deal to say.  Though Professor Dawkins is the more widely known figure, I think Dr. Lennox is equally brilliant here.  That Prof. Dawkins underestimated his opponent is clear by simply looking at the notes each man brought with him - Prof. Dawkins brought a few sheets of paper while Dr. Lennox filled an entire binder.  As such, Dr. Lennox more than admirably holds his own in this debate, and I think the BBC tagline put it well: ""Darwin's rottweiler is about to get a run for his money,"" though it is usually difficult to declare a clear victor in a public debate.

If you are interested in the open and honest exchange of ideas, and want to see a very unique example of just that, there's no better place to find it than this DVD.",1217894400,79,1564,4.617328519855596
3503562,5,B001C19HNM,"I laughed when I saw a BBC comment on the front of the disk: ""Darwin's Rottweiler is about to get a run for his money..."" ;)  The debate is not long--only an hour and a half--and I wish it had been structured a little differently, but otherwise this is a worthwhile investment of time and money. Dawkins, of course, is the godfather of New Atheism, and the format obviously frustrated him because he had to go first and never felt like he could respond to Lennox's points. Both are from Oxford, and they had some real lively exchanges. Lennox held his own and didn't allow Dawkins to get away with very much. Was there a winner? Honestly, it probably was a draw. Again, the sit-down style taking turns responding to quotes out of Dawkins' book did not easily allow for exchanges, and perhaps a longer time period (questions from the audience) could have been allowed. Of course, I've seen several dozen debates in my lifetime--half a dozen or so live--and I probably could have critiqued each of the debates in this same manner. So, there's probably no perfect system, but just the exchange of ideas is worthwhile. And, as I think as naturalist/atheist would have to admit, Evolution and Darwinism is not just a slam dunk. Debates like this help to eliminate some of the stereotypical straw man presentations I'm sure Dawkins (and thousands of other professors around the globe) gives on a regular basis, so if nothing more, I'd recommend both sides seriously considering the others' viewpoints.",1215043200,40,1495,4.794573643410852
3503563,4,B001C19HNM,"Yesterday I finished leading three weeks of adult Sunday school based on the film The God Delusion Debate, a dialogue/debate between Richard Dawkins and John Lennox. Overall it was an engaging dialogue and Lennox made some good points. He also had what was undoubtedly the best line of the event. After the moderator quoted Dawkins appealing to John Lennon (Imagine theres no heaven) Lennox responded that rather than listen to John Lennon he should now listen to John Lennox. (The second best line also belonged to Lennox when he asked Dawkins if he had faith in his wife.)

But Lennox stumbled at a few points, though I doubt many people in the room would have noticed. The two main quibbles I had with him concerned his comments on epistemology and cosmology.

Epistemology

The first problem came when Lennox responded to Dawkins anti-faith rhetoric by insisting that faith is based on evidence. This implies a type of evidentialism in which every proposition one rationally believes requires some evidence. But this quickly runs into problems. Consider a simple example.

You need directions for a used book shop. So you stop a passerby and ask him directions. He tells you Three blocks east and then turn left at 21st ave. Its beside the flower shop. Based on those directions you proceed down the street three blocks east and turn left

You clearly had faith in the testimony of that passerby. But what evidence was the faith based on? After all, youd never met the fellow before. Perhaps Lennox could reply like this:

If Im going to buy a used car I start it up and look it over. If it idles smoothly and there are no visible problems then that is evidence that the car is reliable. It may not be first-rate evidence, but it is evidence just the same. Well the same goes for testimony. The fact that the passerby appears reasonable and honest  everything seems to be running smoothly  provides evidence that he is trustworthy. Granted he could be a liar and the car could be a lemon. But in each case there is evidence on which faith is based. Perhaps.

At this point we find ourselves grappling with the blurred lines of the concept of evidence. Evidence is that which provides a reason or ground to assent to the truth of a proposition. So when does something provide a reason or ground to believe something else is true? Does the fact that a person appears to be reasonable and honest provide a reason or ground to assent to the truth of what that person says? Perhaps we ought to trust that person, but is it proper to say that were trusting them based on evidence?

The bottom line is that we cant seek evidence for everything we believe. And any attempt to ground all our beliefs in evidence will end up defining evidence so broadly as to make the concept nearly meaningless.

Consequently it would be much better to say that in some cases it is proper to assent to the truth of a proposition even when there is no direct evidence for it. We need starting points from which we can begin to reason. These starting points are not indefeasible, they could be wrong, they are open to critical analysis. But we accept them unless we have a reason not to.

By presenting that kind of position Lennox would have an epistemology which is psychologically more defensible (i.e. it represents the way people actually reason), which does not render the concept of evidence vacuous, and which challenges Dawkins facile commentary on faith. Unfortunately he chose instead to take the lower road by accepting the same tacit commitment to unqualified evidentialism that is assumed by Dawkins.

Cosmology

The other big quibble I had came when Lennox argues for the authority of the Bible based on the alleged congruence of Genesis 1 and Big Bang cosmology. This attempt to equate Let there be light with T=0 strikes me as very naive. Imagine somebody defending the importance of Little Red Cap (the original Grimms version of Little Red Riding Hood). Out of one corner of their mouth they say It is a German folktale and shouldnt be read literally and yet out of the other corner they point to an ancient red cloak that was discovered deep in the Black Forest as evidence for the texts value. Which is it? Is Little Red Cap to be defended by identifying correlations with past history or not?

My point is not that the Bible is just a folktale. The point, rather, is that you have to be consistent to the genre of a text when you're seeking to defend its value to others. To say that Genesis 1 is an ANE cosmogonic creation narrative which is a theological rather than scientific account of the universe, but then add that it ALSO is scientific here or there is to talk out of both corners of the mouth.

On this point Dawkins had the third best line of the evening when he pointed out that there are only two possibilities: either the universe had an origin a finite time ago or it didnt. The fact that Genesis 1 may have got this right is thus no more noteworthy than calling a coin toss.

3503567,1,B001C19HNM,"I agree with Evan Carroll. I was very disappointed with this semblence of a debate. It almost appeared that Prof. Dawkins was being too polite and trying not to come across as a ""buster"" or as disrespectful. I will give Dr. Lennox credit for not being a typical fundamentalist. He was polite also, to a point, but very cagey. He agreed on all of the points that Prof. Dawkins made that anyone would agree were rational and that then gave him a semblance of being rational, himself. That, then enabled him to later spew irrationality and still be considered as rational.

Prof. Dawkins didn't seem to fight back or use any of the marvelous reasoning that is evident in his book and I don't know why. Dr. Lenox equating atheists with Stalin and saying that the Communists committed all of their attrocities because they were atheists, is ridiculous. It's a question of which came first; the chicken or the egg? The bulk of seriously abused Russian pessants BECAME COMMUNISTS AND ATHEISTS, not because they were atheists to begin with, but becuase they had been abused and stomped into the ground for centuries by both the Romanovs AND the Russian Orthodox Church. It is then no wonder that they attacked the Church once they gained power.

Atheists do not normally just blindly lash out at anything religious, but they will attack religious organizations that they perceive are harmful to society. It's just as Thomas Jefferson, who was neither a Christian nor an atheist, but a Deist, said: ""I have sworn upon the altar of god,eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.""

These areas cover evolution, creation, morality, religion's involvement in evil, Jesus, and the coherence of science and religion. Professor Dawkins' opponent is Dr John Lennox, a mathematician from Oxford Univeristy. This debate is lively but polite as both know each other well.

3503569,1,B001C19HNM,"This ""debate"" was supported by a christian organisation. The format is like this:
- A third person quotes a chapter of Dawkins' God Delusion
- Dawkins has 5 minutes (he has to look at his stopwatch every time, seems to be very strict)
- Then Lennox has his 5 minutes, telling his Christian views and generally absurd things (All of which can be falsified by those who read Dawkins book)
After that, next chapter. So no chance for a discussion. There is NO debate, the format doesn't allow it. A scam",1296950400,10,499,4.4945054945054945
3503570,4,B001C19HNM,"I'd give it about 4.3 out of 5 stars. Dawkin's is one of the foremost athiestic scientists in the world, but he found a worthy opponent in Dr. Lennox who works with him at Oxford.

Dawkin's presented less information per minute and found himself responding to Lennox attacks on his book. It was obvious Lennox spent more time in preperation for the debate.

Unfortunately, the judge was a weak moderator. He allowed Lennox to squeeze a few minutes extra out of the debate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minute by minute quality of the debate:

Lennox shot alot of holes into Dawkin's book and Dawkin's response lacked in most instances. For instance, Dawking's conceded the improbability that the universe would be tuned for life but invoked the possibility of billions of universes to allow for the possibility of a few fit for life. This ""moved"" the problem, but did not deal with it. In the end, he argued physics has yet to produce a ""Darwin"" to explain this issue.

Dawkin's claim that the invocation of God results in an infinite regress (i.e. the problem of ""Who Created God?"") was handily defeated by Lennox . As he noted, time began with the start of the Universe. If it was created the Creator would be timeless.

In one of his attacks against religion, Dawkin's pointed out many crimes committed in the name of faith but he failed to have an adequate counter to Lennox response regarding Stalin and Mao. As Lennox noted, Jesus told Peter to put his sword away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One Point I Wish They Touched On.

Dawkin's claimed Darwinianism accounts for all of life. Lennox pointed out the fact that it does not explain the origin of the first self-replicating cell. I wish this conversation would have continued!",1286236800,7,1853,5.272108843537415
3503571,1,B001C19HNM,"In the beginning the moderator says the format can be accredited to ""Christian charity""; sadly, I agree. The pretense is that Dawkins gets the first word on each point, and the last word at the end of the debate. After observing, this is clearly not fair. The explicit mention of ""Christian charity"" was spun with amazing intellectual dishonesty. I found myself deeply bothered by this debate, and the format is an obvious sham, this is what you should expect:

(1) An except from Dawkins's book is read by the ""moderator"", then
(2) Dawkins follows up ""explaining"" this excerpt, followed by
(3) Lennox making bold and often ludicrous claims
(4) Wash and repeat.

I believe there are seven points covering seven theses that the host picked from the God delusion. In honesty, the theses are presented in a fair fashion by the moderator.

With that said, the only good exchanges in this debate are when Dawkins breaks the silence imposed by the moderator and he gets a chance to have a direct exchange with Lennox. The vast majority of this debate is Lennox spewing nonsense in a totally unchecked fashion. In my opinion, Dawkins does a poor job in this debate. I  can't help but wonder why Lennox gets the protection from retort; or, why you would invite Dawkins to explain his book willynilly before being attacked by Lennox with prepared arguments -- might I add, all of which are disputed elegantly in the book that is the topic of this conversation.

Lennox came with knowledge of Dawkins's books and the intellectual substance Dawkins was going to bring to the table. It makes absolutely no sense why you would waste time having Dawkins paraphrase his own book before Lennox gets to read his prepared arguments. Why wasn't Lennox on the offensive at first, with Dawkins permitted a retort? Clearly, that would have been a better format. This isn't even really a debate. This is simply Dawkins providing a short verbal synopsis followed by Lennox's quite predictable and easily deflected commentary (under any other circumstances): ""Atheism is a faith"", ""Stalin and Hitler were Atheists"", ""Neither of us believe in that god"", etc (all can be found here).

although john lennox is an intelligent guy, his arguments are weak. i don't think he made any good points against dawkins, certainly nothing that i haven't heard from a christian apologist. lennox actually sounded like a moron in certain segments of the debate. also, when you start talking about miracles and the supernatural there is absolutely no credible argument that anyone can possibly come up with. i wish that religious people who believe in the supernatural would just admit that their belief makes no logical sense but that they, nonetheless, have faith that it is true. just leave it that and stop trying to ""prove"" the validity of ridiculous things in holy books. honestly, it gets tiring after a while.

dawkins makes several good points. in fact, it appears to me that dawkins was not challenged at all by lennox. dawkins had great answers and appeared to easily respond to everything lennox came up with.

lennox is a smart guy and his arguments are very appealing at first listen but dawkins pretty much destroys them with his answers. contrary to the caption on the DVD cover, lennox did not give dawkins a ""run for his money.""
