6824773,4,B00PVRQJ8O,"Don't be put off by the short running time of 75 minutes or the minimal plot, sparse dialog and being basically only a two character film as this German-language film is a surprisingly thoughtful and engaging film.
Student Marlo, whilst visiting a friend in Berlin, accidentally bumps into the moody and not very communicable Kirill while walking around the city streets.  Both see something of interest in each other and agree to meet again the next day which results in a deepening and eventually a sexual relationship.
Not a great deal of character development as such but this probably works in the films favour as it allows the viewer to engage more closely at what clicks between the two protagonists especially when considering they both have been previously involved with girlfriends.  This quiet, unassuming film gives a remarkably honest portrayal of two ""silent youths"" discovering common ground and a budding relationship through awkward and agonizingly insecure moments.
Sometimes less is more and this brief film works extremely well on this level.  Sensitive direction by Diemo Kemmesies and realistic performances by Martin Bruchmann and Josef Mattes add enormously to the films appeal as does the unusual Berlin settings.  This film won't appeal to all but this slow but quietly probing drama deserves viewing.",1424044800,24,1327,5.245283018867925

6824775,5,B00PVRQJ8O,"I really liked this film.  I agree with the other reviewers that it's very slow-paced, and therefore if you're the impatient type, you'd be better off skipping this one.  I found it very interesting how it slowly becomes clear that Kirill definitely has some kind of mental or psychological issues going on, yet Marlo doesn't run away in terror (or run away at all).  I really want to know what happened next.  I wish there was a sequel.",1432944000,4,437,4.564102564102564

6824777,3,B00PVRQJ8O,"This is described by the synopsis as two young men in Berlin who think they are never going to meet that `special one', suddenly brushing hands on the street and then finding that love can blossom in the strangest of places. One is Marlo who has just moved in with a girlfriend who does not know he is gay. The other is Kirill who has just returned from a less than successful visit to Moscow - and has some issues.

This starts off very well but then it becomes clear pretty fast that Kirill has behavioural and or mental health issues and Marlo - to his credit - bears with it. I think this is supposed to be about finding love despite the differences and the fragile nature that some of us become. However, there were so many long drawn out shots where very little happens. This includes walking, sitting, eating or just doing bugger all really. I just wanted something to happen. There are no bedroom `goings on' here either - in case you were wondering. I have seen more action in a detergent commercial to be honest.

Also this is only 73 minutes in length and did feel longer. I appreciate a `lyrical' delivery of a story but there has to be some `poetry' to keep it afloat and I felt that too was lacking. There was  a German film out a few years ago called `Harvest' and I felt that too was lacking, but a lot of people really liked it. If you found that one good then you may well find something here too; if however you preferred German offerings like `Freefall', `Balls', or even the excellent `Sumerstorm', then this will probably not be for you.",1430956800,5,1559,4.36896551724138

6824780,3,B00PVRQJ8O,"The title well describes this film --- it's 73 minutes focused on 2 youthful men who are rather silent most of the time. That said, it's not necessarily a bad film, it's just different, but it won't leave most viewers immersed either.

The story centers around 2 college age students who have a passing encounter which leads to a friendship (of sorts) which leads to some romantic embraces. There is some conversation along the way, none very deep, and that pretty much wraps up this 73 minute film.  There is but one provocative line, but you'll have to get to the end to hear it for yourself.

On the plus side, the characters are generally likable, and the story line is delicate (many can certainly relate to these 'first time' encounters).  The film quality and acting are good but at times I felt the production was more focused on the visual landscapes than actually telling a story.  If you're looking for a tender slow moving story of two young men coming of age, with little dialogue, limited depth and very little sexual energy, you'll probably like the film.

On the contrary, this was definitely one of my least favorite films, and I would not watch it again nor suggest it to friends as a must see (or even a ""you would really like it"").  There is not much of a plot, and there is very little depth to the characters.  The lack of dialog is frustrating, not artistic.  I can understand the 1-star review, though the 5-star ones are a bit too kind in my opinion.  I rated it 3 stars vs. 2 simply because it delivered what it advertises (read the product description  - it's accurate).

The statement ""awkwardly sitting across from each other not knowing what to say"" pretty much sums up my opinion after watching the movie.  To that end, the writers / producers / actors delivered what they promised.  However, I have seen far better coming of age films that while delicate had far more substance.",1427673600,,1910,4.579411764705882
6824781,4,B00PVRQJ8O,"This was much, much better than I expected. Definitely ""different,"" but the viewer feels all of the awkwardness, angst and confusion right along with the characters. With fairly minimal dialogue, very little action and basic plot, one might think that the movie would drag, but it was over before I knew it, and left me wishing for more. I would certainly recommend this one.",1427414400,5,375,4.875
6824782,1,B00PVRQJ8O,"Coma inducing boring. Picture someone following 2 skinny twinks around berlin with a shaky hand held camera with very little dialogue and no plot or story. 2 make out scenes with no skin or sex. Really bad picture and sound quality. This ""movie"" starts nowhere, goes nowhere, and ends nowhere. Period.",1427155200,2,301,4.921568627450981

8689482,1,B00PVRQJ8O,"My thoughts were that there have to be tons of other more interesting gay guys in Berlin to follow around all day and you don't have to settle for someone mental and slightly creepy (the character named Kirill, who must have some serious issues) that does not talk to you and does not want to cuddle with you. I wanted to ask the main character (Marlo), ""Why would you want to hang out day after day with this mental guy? Just because he lightly touched your hand as the two of you passed on a street?"" The single redeeming activity between the two main characters is when they go to the mental guy's apartment and shampoo each other's hair. Besides that three minute scene, it was just them silently walking the streets, silently sitting in a bedroom, and silently chilling out in various spots in Berlin. Yaaaaawn! Nothing tender, nothing to draw them into a relationship other than a chance touch as they pass on the street? Really?",1505260800,,935,4.571428571428571

8689488,4,B00PVRQJ8O,"I liked the story.  It played well with the 'Awkward pause' in the strained dialogue between the two young men. Both of them were cautious and tentative, but they did gradually draw together. The beauty of the story is that they were having a tough time making a connection, but overall, it eventually came to a promising end.  The film was a bit too short, but I think it is one of the better gay films I've seen",1442793600,,413,4.282051282051282

8689490,5,B00PVRQJ8O,"This movie was excellent.  The pace reminded me of a wonderful film by Julian Hernandez: Raging Sun, Raging Sky.  Silent Youth, on the surface, is a boy meets boy movie and that's it, nothing more. Usually I find real-time movies a bit dull, but this movie shows the inner turmoil of these two youths  with such sensitivity and awareness that it had me riveted to my seat the entire time.  The character of Russian decent is obviously traumatized, has PTSD, severe bouts of depersonalization (shutting down) and the things that he utters and does are off the wall if not a bit crazy.  The other character appears a bit more functional except for his attraction to the tormented young man.  The director Diemo Kemmesies creates a tension between these two characters that carries the entire movie. The tension is so extreme that I kept thinking something horrible is going to happen.  But it never does.  There are no sex scenes, no sexual exploitation, which in turn heightens the sense of turmoil and innocence.",1441756800,,1012,4.809248554913295
