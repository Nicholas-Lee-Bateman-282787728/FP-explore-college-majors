5424759,5,B00AHEJOVA,"I'll save you a bit of time before I start raving: I wholeheartedly recommend this program.  Buy it!  It is the Holy Grail of kettlebell systems.  Skip to the bottom for a brief pros vs cons summary.

A little over a year ago, Steve Cotter released his Extreme Strength program (http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Cotter-Extreme-Strength-Kettlebell/dp/B006MHH90O/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=1IRXRFE596A2I&coliid=I3UQYLANOS3X55).  I thoroughly enjoyed the program--well, as much as you can enjoy gruelingly excruciating workouts--but something was missing.  You see, though the addition of barbell work was welcome, the program lacked exercises that targeted the chest, back, and core as much as I would have liked.
Of course kettlebell movements inherently incorporate some of these muscle groups but I believe that the system's major failing was neglecting to focus on these major muscle groups which is why I couldn't give it a five-star rating.

Now, Mr. Cotter has released a program that addresses my concerns with his latest program--and with spectacular results.  The Science of Kettlebells: Push Pull Series recognizes that a major flaw in most kettlebell programs is a focus on movements that are primarily vertical (e.g. the press, the clean, the snatch etc.).  These movements are rightfully cornerstones in any serious kettlebell regimen.  However, the overemphasis on them can create weak links in trainees' bodies.  For instance, the deltoids and trapezius might be highly developed but the pectoralis major might, in turn, be underdeveloped.  This inevitably leads to imbalances in the physique but, more importantly to me, leads to underperformance in athletics and in daily living.

Mr. Cotter correctly posits that, for both ideal performance and bodybuilding, five principal movements must be trained: pushing, pulling (both vertically and horizontally), core (both stability and dynamic movement), hip dominant movements (i.e. hamstrings, lower back, gluteus) , and knee dominant movements (i.e. quadriceps, quadriceps, quadriceps).

The disks are primarily designed for follow-along use.  That is, you perform the exercises with Mr. Cotter (keeping up with him will be no easy feat--it never is!) using the helpful training schedule that accompanies the set.  However, what excites me the most is the emphasis on the principles of sound program design and not simply performing the workouts by rote.

You see, on the introductory sections, Mr. Cotter goes over every movement that he'll perform during the course of the workout.  The instruction is world class per usual and he covers fine points like not allowing the bell to migrate too far from your body and proper breathing patterns.  What I love the most is that he also goes over alternatives to the movements that can either challenge you more once you've peaked with a given weight or the exercises become too easy, make the exercises more tenable to newer trainees or to those working around chronic injuries, and, finally, suitable replacements for the exercise of the day.

For example, on the vertical push/pull day, you'd like to mix things up and don't necessarily want to do push presses and cleans that Mr. Cotter performs.  Not a problem!  Just replace the push presses with strict military presses and the cleans with pullups.

This highlights the brilliance of the program: the principles of the exercises chosen are key not the exercises per se.  In fact, over time you are encouraged to experiment and to develop your own program with exercises that suit your individual needs.  As long as you stay true to the movement patterns, you will ALWAYS see results.  Compared to a program like, say, P90X where you essentially perform exercises verbatim, this is revolutionary!  You don't necessarily have to use the disks ad infinitum--you can develop your own program once you understand how--a masterstroke on Mr. Cotter's part!

While it is recommended that you do the the full, five day per week program, Mr. Cotter realizes that people get busy in real life.  Sorry, workaholics, there's no excuse not to get into top shape: there are two whole-body series that incorporate all of the movement patterns.  One of them is for strength while the other is for endurance.  You alternate between the two for a few days a week as your schedule allows.  While these whole body workouts aren't as comprehensive as the specific ones, believe me, if you use them you will be in better condition than 90% of the population!

To wrap up, here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
-Effective, no-nonsense, hard work
-Strength building and cardiovascular (both aerobic and anaerobic)development are achieved with every workout
-Customization: Can be used by anyone--from newbies to seasoned practitioners
-Suitable for athletes and those interested in bodybuilding with kettelebells
-Encourages experimentation and using exercises and weights that suit your needs
-Thorough instruction on every exercise in the program
-Includes flexibility/stretching
-Includes a focus on core strength and stability that was missing from Extreme Strength
-Includes an abbreviated regimen for busy people
-Most workouts are 25 minutes or less--add in warm-ups and cool-downs and you can expect to invest only ~40 minutes a day

Cons:
-Does being humbled by trying to keep up with the nearly superhuman Steve Cotter count as a program flaw?
-The Core section might tire some trainees' shoulders as much or more than their abdominals.  (Being the kettlebell nerd that I am, I have Mr, Cotter's Complete Guide to Kettlebell Lifting and, depending on how my shoulders feel, will swap out the Turkish getup for a core move that's less taxing on the shoulders.)",1355443200,36,5712,5.357222844344905
8551570,5,B00AHEJOVA,"These 3 DVDs are well produced.
Steve Kotter takes lots of time to give context for the movements, building strength and taking care of yourself. He's extremely thorough, an excellent teacher, and does the workouts right along with you.
I'm just beginning the routines and I'm impressed and inspired with this series. Not sure if it's his martial arts background, but S Kotter is committed to his craft in a rare way.
Highly recommended.",1437436800,,437,4.918918918918919

8551576,2,B00AHEJOVA,"The dude talks forever about nothing before he gets around to his blah workout. It's so annoying that I could nit motivate myself to determine when he would actually start the workout. When I did finally decide to endure through to the workout, it was just plain boringly tedious. There are others out there who make DVDs that get you I to it while giving you a workout. Maybe someday I might not think this was a waste of every cent I spent on it, so I'll keep it. For a while.",1382140800,2,478,4.206521739130435
8551577,5,B00AHEJOVA,"This program is fantastic! Probably the best kettlebell program I have ever tried. Most kettlebell programs forget that the pecs are muscles at all and just focus on military press. This program is incredibly well rounded, it has it all.

This program is not for beginners. It is probably not really for intermediates. This is an advanced routine that is incredibly challenging. But it is a lot of fun.",1379462400,4,402,4.826086956521739
8551578,5,B00AHEJOVA,This is a great DVD!  The workout is very tough!  Steve Cotter is a machine!!  It is fantastic for strength development and core strength.,1377561600,3,138,4.666666666666667
8551579,5,B00AHEJOVA,There are many helpful DVD's out there on kettlebell lifting. Some - including others produced by Steve - go into greater depth in certain areas. However if a person was looking to purchase their first one - or if they were only planning on having a single DVD set on kettlebells - this would be my recommendation. It offers a complete workout program covering the most productive moves and comes with Steve's superb instructional style. It's easy to tell that Steve has devoted a lifetime to mastering his body and this really shows. His flexibility is superb and his presence inspires confidence. Technique and cuing is as first class and he intersperses the exercise demonstrations with just the right amount of verbal input. No background music or fluff - just serious training for serious results.,1373587200,9,802,4.948148148148148
