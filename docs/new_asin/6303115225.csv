7837821,5,6303115225,"Plot:  Another Galaxy-class starship, the USS Yamato, has contacted the Enterprise in the Neutral Zone, explaining that they are having problems with their computers.  Picard, naturally, wants to know why in the universe a Federation starship has been flying around the Neutral Zone.  The Yamato's captain explains that he had found some info that the so-called mythological Iconions (a species reputed with incredibly superior technology to the Federation) were far less than such.  Suddenly, the Yamato explodes, leaving no survivors.  As if things couldn't get any worse, a Romulan Warbird suddenly appears and demands an explanation for the presence of the Enterprise (and Yamato).  Picard says in respsonse that he will not leave the Neutral Zone until he is completely certain that the Yamato's destruction wasn't because of the Romulans (which they had denied).  After finding some clues on the Yamato captain's personal log, the Enterprise whizzes off to Iconia.  Of course, we can't have a good story without some woe falling upon the Enterprise.  The Enterprise begins to exhibit similar problems that the Yamato had until she blew up.  Geordi finally figures out the problem:  A probe had scanned the Yamato and had it was completely re-writing the ship's systems, causing a fatal malfunction in the warp engines.  But by downloading the log, the virus was now trying to do the same thing to the Enterprise.  So Picard must find out if he can solve the problem by going down to Iconia and checking if there are records on how to use the technology (like as in, deactivate it.)

Great episode.  While, yes, the solution of re-booting would seem nowadays to be like ""DUH!"" to us, when this episode was first aired, PC's, internet, etc. were pretty new.  So I think they can be forgiven for that.  As far as the problem of left over pieces of the Iconion installation are concerned, if you look carefully on the planet as the Romulan Warbird and Enterprise leave, you can see multiple explosion on the surface.  So, I think we can safely say that if there's anything left, it would have been quite useless for technological advancement.

Overall, a pretty good episode if one get's past the solution of the episode.  Plenty of action and it is well paced.",1158019200,,2263,4.936507936507937

Steve Gerber (creator of Howard the Duck) and writer Beth Woods wrote this terrific entry in the second season.  It's about the Captain of the starship Yamato and his startling discovery in the Neutral Zone.  He found a civilization that was long ago conquered but it's probes were still intact.  The probe tragically infected all the computer systems with a virus destroying the Yamato.  The same virus contaminated logs that were downloaded to the Enterprise!  The episode has some dramatic moments where Data is almost destroyed by the probe.
When Picard, Worf and Data beam to a site where the signal is located; we discover the conquered Iconians left a legacy of destruction and deadly weapons.  We see the gateway where perhaps the civilization escaped to preserve itself.
I was very surprised that Steve Gerber and Beth Woods, the authors of this story, were never called back for a sequel.  Not even a book in the new Gateways series.  I would have liked to have seen their version of what happened to this great civilization.",994982400,3,1047,4.875706214689266

This is a welly written episode about the Enterprise stopping the Romulans from getting their hands on a  new peice of Technology.  About 7 years later the Dominion on Star Trek  Deep Space Nine would also try to win control of this Iconian Gateway.  GREAT EPISODE!!!!",928972800,8,381,4.815384615384615
