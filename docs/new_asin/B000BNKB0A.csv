2429754,5,B000BNKB0A,"Pilates are hard!  You know those moments in a pilates class when you find yourself actively hating the person making you do these really hard painful things?  Well, she moves so quickly through the exercises that you can do them.  This is the first pilates tape I've bought that I feel exercised and competent doing.  I'm sore the next day, in that really great ""I did Pilates!"" way.  It's working and it's doable.",1203552000,,415,4.63013698630137
2429755,5,B000BNKB0A,"I love this workout. Even when I lack energy for a more energetic workout, I can carry this out and it warms up all my muscles and makes me feel great.",1167955200,,151,3.903225806451613
2429756,3,B000BNKB0A,"It's true, this is one workout, not two.  There are, however, two instructors to follow, making it both beginner and ""intermediate"" level.  The music is not auditorialy exciting, and the set is not visually exciting, but the workout can be tailored to be challenging, but not strenuous.  I give it a rating of average.",1167782400,,318,4.851851851851852
2429757,5,B000BNKB0A,"As someone who has been practicing Pilates for quite awhile now, I am always on the lookout for short Pilates workouts which are appropriate for my intermediate level; I also prefer my Pilates videos to be mainly abs-focused.  Happily, this 20 Minute Overall Body Workout fit the bill perfectly.  Although it purports to be a full-body workout, it actually concentrates mainly on the abs area, with some back work thrown in for counterbalance.  Also, as performed by instructor Amy Brown, this workout is definitely at an intermediate level (the ""Beginner's Workout"" referred to on the DVD case is simply Amy's assistant, Liza, showing modifications, not a separate workout).

The workout begins with Pilates breathing in a reclined position.  Then Amy moves on to what she calls the ""hundreds"" but which was a different version of this exercise than I've ever seen before:  she simply breathes with her legs in the air and her head up.  In fact, throughout this workout, Amy adds many unique variations to the traditional Pilates matwork, such as doing a twist while holding a teaser.  I also found the sequencing of the exercises to be very different from what I've come to expect with Pilates.  For example, right after the hundreds, Amy goes into the criss-cross, and rolling like a ball comes fairly late in the workout.  However, I thought the sequencing worked very well, especially Amy's tendency to balance out a series of abs moves with some brief back work; I liked this a lot.  There is only one side-lying move, but because I prefer abs work, I didn't mind this.

Another thing I liked about this workout was the pacing:  Amy does a higher number of reps than you will usually see in a Pilates workout, but the pace is never rushed.  On the other hand, this workout moves along steadily with no down time between exercises.  Amy concludes the workout with a few neck stretches, which I absolutely loved!  Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable, thorough Pilates workout, and I know I will get a lot of use from it.",1156377600,23,2033,4.765714285714286
2429758,4,B000BNKB0A,"as was said before, there is only one workout, and not two.

the instructur gives very clear instructions, which are also easy to understand since she is not speaking at the same time of exercising (the sound was added later).

the HOLY principles of pilates are not presented at the beginging of the workout as in other pilates DVDs that I've tried. However, she keeps reminding things like relaxing the shoulders and pulling the ""powerhouse"" in, which is good.

there is something which I'm sure some people will find quite disappointing..there is NO FUN. pure pilates exercise. an excellent pilates exercise, but nothing but that.",1141171200,12,633,5.0095238095238095

8089427,5,B000BNKB0A,I use this same one for abs. It's an enjoyable workout,1434844800,,54,4.0
8089428,4,B000BNKB0A,It's a pretty good workout. Only 20 minutes so it's great for days when I'm short on time. It can sometimes be a little difficult to follow. Especially when you're lying face down on the mat and she forgets to cue you. But it's certainly worth the $5 I paid for it.,1424908800,,265,4.115384615384615
8089429,5,B000BNKB0A,"Amy Brown is a very good teacher.  The 20 minutes is just about it for me but I do enjoy the ""class"".",1412380800,,101,3.590909090909091
8089430,5,B000BNKB0A,"Very to the point, not much to these DVDs. I'm satisfied with it. No wasted time on advertisement like other workout DVDs.",1377561600,,122,4.590909090909091
8089431,3,B000BNKB0A,"This workout is really all about the abs, especially your upper abs. It's all floor work. I resort to this video when I want to focus on my core, when I'm looking for something lower-intensity, and when I'm pressed for time. The ""rolling like a ball"" exercise is fun, but not all that effective. It starts out with some breathing laying on your back, which I feel could be omitted or shortened in a 20-minute workout. The cool-down is really brief and just involves some seated neck and arm poses. The most effective positions are the bicycle-crunches as well as the ""side-lying series"" where you can really feel it in your obliques. The video has a really serious, professional feel to it--would be better if they smiled once or twice. Some of the moves appear to require more flexibility, which the instructor certainly has, like touching your toes with your legs straight, something I've always struggled with. Interestingly, the pose on the DVD cover was never performed in this workout video.",1374537600,,997,4.83625730994152
8089432,3,B000BNKB0A,"I had a few issues with this sneaky Pilates workout. It is implied several times that there are 2 different workouts here. On the cover it says ""20 minute workout(S) and on the back it states that the DVD ""includes 2 workout levels"" as does the menu; Intermediate level and Advanced. In fact they are both exactly the same workout word for word, pose for pose.

My other issue is that this is advertised as an OVERALL Body workout while the actual practice spends 15 minutes working on your core alone, with only a couple of other exercises thrown in. Now while I definitely felt this in my abs it wasn't why I bought it, and I know that this DVD WON'T be helping me to ""strengthen my entire body"", ""trimming my hips"" or firming my butt"" like it says on the back.

Once you get down to it though the actual workout is quite good; taking place indoors with non descript ambient music and dubbed in voice instruction. Amy Brown shows the advanced moves and instructs while one other girl shows the easier modifications. Her voice instruction has been dubbed in but its clear, precise, chatter free and easy to follow.

We begin on our backs with; Hundreds, Hip Circles, Bicycle, Oblique's and Roll ups for a total of 8 min. Turning to our stomach for the swan (2 min) and returning for more ab work including; Teaser (roll ups), Rolling like a ball, Open leg rocker and Swimming. At the 15 min mark we do 3 (yes 3) push-ups before starting a quick side lying series. Amy ends with a brief (1 min) seated neck stretch.

So all in all a good ab workout, if thats what you're looking for but due to the sneaky and implied word placement I won't be purchasing anything else from Pilates for life.",1325808000,,1690,4.42443729903537
8089433,1,B000BNKB0A,"Bad quality DVD. No sound. Cannot use it. The content is not ""exiting"" Do not buy this DVD and do not buy anything from this seller. The seller did not respond to my request either.",1271980800,,181,4.2
8089434,5,B000BNKB0A,"This DVD has a good range of exercises, considering it's only 20 minutes long--it would be a great starter workout for anyone new to Pilates, as well as being useful for someone that's more advanced who's short on time. Amy Brown has a sweet way about her, and a pleasant voice--after a short introduction, she gets right down to business and doesn't waste any time. The workout is challenging but not too strenuous, and the beginner level Teaser variation is one I can actually do, after never being able to get the knack of the one featured on a different Pilates DVD I own and tried to do for over a year. I'm very happy overall with this workout.",1251676800,,650,4.470588235294118
8089435,4,B000BNKB0A,Easy to understand and follow along.  I do this everyday and it makes me feel great!!!,1218499200,,86,4.375
