7799044,3,157742249X,"The sequel to Molly: Happily Ever After deals with Molly still in casual denial about her parents' divorce, followed by her understandable outrage when her mother decides to remarry. Script-wise, it's on par with its predecessor, and I doubt anyone could improve upon it; however, the actual animation seems somewhat... scattered by comparison. There are multiple jump cuts that give snippets of Molly's point of view, but they feel jarring the way they're handled, as though they weren't specifically sure what they were going for from scene to scene, while ""Happily"" has a cohesive flow from beginning to end. I suppose it's as good as any coping aid for the child(ren) of an impending or ongoing divorce, as I certainly learned (painlessly!) about divorce myself from the cartoon. As an adult, though, it feels awkward and jarring to watch.",1384992000,,843,5.071942446043166
