1075941,5,6305812071,"Of all the occult thillers that I have seen, this one is my most favorite. Not only does this intelligent horror film deliver the goods for nightmares, it carries a large cast of some very fine characters. Martin Sheen, Jimmy Smits, Robert Loggia and Helen Shaver are exceptonally good in their performances. However, the one that will stand out the most is the little known Malick Bowens. Bowens gives the film's villainous role such a demonic prescience, that it could perhaps scare Old Ned himself. This is a great film for those who do not spook easily and/or those with strong stomachs. However, it would be wise to forbid anyone under 15 to view this film because as I said before, it does not skimp on the details of ritualistic murders and supernatural occurences.",1031529600,4,772,4.768656716417911
1075942,4,6305812071,"This is a pretty scarey movie! The fact that it is a little old does not detract because this could happen anytime in any decade.
In a nutshell; A Father and his young son deal with shattering events in their lives and then are pulled into terrifying dangerous world of cults and ritualistic murder. Will they both come through all this alive?
More, if the above looks exciting:
The father is a police psychologist and there are some strange killings with horrible cult like killings. The father is deemed thru his job to frame a profile of this killer so that they can catch the killer.
As the movie moves forward, things begin to happen that keep you on the edge of your seat and delve you into the strange freakish world of cults and sacrificial killings.  Soon this father and his son are pulled into the killer(s) world closer and closer and it will affect them both for the rest of their lives if they live through it!
Shocking surprise of an ending but I won't give any telling details of the movie away in case you want to see this and haven't yet seen the movie on cable or reg. tv. I would rent it before buying because it's a pretty disturbing movie but great if you like really freaky scarey movies.

Fast moving with very good acting. keeps you on edge. The boy does very good acting and the movie is very entertaining. Wanna get scared and have a good movie to watch on Friday night? Well this is it. Does not have all the blood and guts of a slasher movie. But plot moves foward at a good click and I liked it.

1075945,3,6305812071,"""The Believers"" is going to offend a lot of people, and with good reason. The movie portends to be about the ""cult"" of Santera and the dangers it poses to non-believers; what the movie shows has little or nothing to do with Santera. To give credit where it is due, one of the characters, on viewing the carnage, says that this is not Santera, it's brujera, which is Spanish for witchcraft; it's closer to the mark, but even brujera, as far as I have read, doesn't make a practice out of the ritual sacrifice of small children. Santera itself is a hardly a cult; it's a religion practiced or believed in by more than 100 million people in the Americas (it's closely related to Voodoo in Haiti and Candomble in Brazil); it's a syncretism between the Yoruba gods and the Roman Catholic saints, and it does not involve shedding human blood.

That said, ""The Believers"" is an intriguing film about a police psychiatrist who comes to New York City with his small son after the death of his wife in a freak accident. He is called by the NYPD after one of their own apparently goes berserk, raving about ""they"" have his badge and ""they"" can get anyone. ""They"" turn out to be a group of lunatics who think they can take over society through their own twisted version of what they call Santera, once they have achieved the ritual slaughter of three small boys by the summer solstice. They have already killed two; guess whom they are targeting as the third?

There's a lot of blood and gore as the cult proves very adept at inducing everyone who gets in their way to commit unpleasant forms of suicide; the psychiatrist finds to his horror that one of his own in-laws is deeply involved in the cult after having sacrified his own young son, and after managing to rescue his child from being the cult's third sacrifice, the psychiatrist leaves New York behind and retreats to the country, only to find that Santera has followed him. The ending is improbable, to say the least, but if you're interested in a movie with a lot of twists and turns, this one is fun to watch. Be warned, however, that its basic premise is flawed, and the film casts a serious and unwarranted slur on the religion of Santera.

1075946,1,6305812071,"I saw this video and was not really pleased, as I had read the novel, ""The Religion"" and it was so absolutely engrossing in it's content. I had hoped for the same to happen with the movie, as well.  I was dissapointed that the book was not followed very well, at all and other than it mentioning the fact, it was a screenplay, based on the novel ""The Religion"", there was not much in the simularity department--now, I would love to find someone who knows anything about locating the novel, as I can no longer find it, anywhere and would love to re-read it, as it is a novel that is perfect, for the person who wants to be kept up all night, just to finish it... if true, as it claims to be.  Therefore, the video was not very satisfying, as I had hoped-which surprised me even more, because of having Martin Sheen as the lead in it.

This HD restoration is a rise above the old MGM dvd for sure.

The film reveals the skull behind the curtain, watch for the fish tank scene.  I gave this film a 5 star because it gives the viewer an eerie feeling; like the people that made this movie are close to tampering with something they should have had more understanding and respect for; as this ancient religion witch evolved from African ritual that made its way to the forbidden island through slavery is still practiced by many who see it as the true light to the darkness.",1391644800,,790,4.635714285714286

Many of the Catholic European saints are matched with native animals or values. The religion is fascinating though the film is for the most part drama, it is without question a Primer on the subject. I am presently employed as a college instructor, but prior to my retirement from law enforcement, we actually encountered many who practiced this religion among those sent from Cuba during the Boat Lift of the Carter Administration, when Castro dumped thousands of Cuban criminals into the U.S. population.

1076470,4,6305812071,"Psychiatrist Carl Jameson {Martin Sheen} returns from his morning jog through the streets of an idyllic New York suburb to find deadly trajedy on that brisk dawn, while washing off in the shower, his wife is electrocuted by the coffee machine conducted by spilled milk at her feet. Hypothetically, all he would have had to do to save her life was to use a wooden broomhandle or an otherwise wooden tool to jar her from the current, and all would have been well. Instead, he and his son just scream as she convulses.

Now as a single father, he seeks the aid of a superstitious hispanic maid to help in keeping the house in order and babysit the child, but her meddling increases soon after she discovers Chris has come into 'possession' of a colorfully decorated conch shell found in Central Park at a bloody ritual scene including goat and cat victims*.

As an aside, some really nice shots of the Twin Towers, as well as a rock formation used in plenty of media spots, including the film Little Nicky.

After two mutilated human child sacrifices are discovered upon makeshift altars, Jameson decides to investigate Santeria & Voodoo, discovering the parallels of Orishas {Gods} masquerading as Catholic saints and deities, who were inregrated into these peasant religions during the slavery oppression to avoid further punishment. At the time, only they knew of their double-identites. Variations on these multi-cultural religions evolved according to race and tribe. In the movie, the script takes artistic license when a frightened character mentions ""Brujeria"", the Spanish word for 'witchcraft', more specifically in this context, 'dark witchcraft'.

Jimmy Smits plays cop Tom Lopez, who is tormented with the thought of the cultists acquiring his badge, a potent sympathetic connection, to which he degenerates to threatening other officers, paranoia and eventual suicide, when a remedy obtained at a botanica fails to alleviate his abdominal pain. A subsequent autopsy divulges serpents had filled his intestines as a direct consequence of a Palero {Witch Doctor} binding Lopez's shield with black cord and having a serpent slither upon it within a cauldron. Investigators target Oscar Sezine, the author of a book on these belief-systems, who now runs a children's center, who befriends Jameson, offering 'spiritual' help, and invites him to meet with some of his associates, inclusive of the charity's founder.

When Jameson walks in on the maid performing an exorcism on his son, he has enough and fires her, as well as smashing the holy bric-a-brac she began filling the house with. It is also mentioned that she had cast a love spell on he and Jessica Halliday {Helen Shaver, who incidentally, strongly resembles one Priscilla Barnes / Terri Alden from Three's Company; same actress different names?}.

The plot thickens when Jameson and Jessica Halliday attend a 'business convention' populated by prominant business people and socialites, inclusive most suspiciously, of parents of one of the children sacrificed! A telling clue to the influence of the cult which is confirmed when the Palero appears to perform the possession dance, selecting Halliday, of all people, transmitting orisha energy from his pale eyes into her. Eventually, Jamison is drugged and the nefarious plan unfolds which includes the sacrifice of his own son as well as his own introduction within the cult.** Fortunately for he and his son, a friend's forethought aids him in thwarting the murder, thus barely escaping with their lives, but not before a most impressive concluding scene wherein the Palero meets his demise after a long fall...

A final and most surprising twist reveals the pervasive presence of the dark orishas...

Probably inspirational to the subsequent film The Serpent & The Rainbow, The Believers is essentially a fictional cult movie displaying the psychology of 'true believer' fundamentalist types by whatever name, and its potentially criminal results.

* ""Sacrifice"" is uneccessary in the practice of Magic, and is not practiced in Satanism {see page 89 in The Satanic Bible}. The primary ingredients are mental directive, timing, and emotional force, not blood-letting. Although according to Vodoun tradition, the animal is often used to feed the congregants afterwards.

** In Judeo-Christian mythology: shades of Abraham's near sacrifice of his son Isaac to Yahweh {Genesis 22:2}, as well as Jehovah's successful sacrifice of his own son jesus. Not to mention the countless animal sacrifices.

1076472,5,6305812071,"John Schlesinger (Midnight Cowboy, Marathon Man, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Day of the Locust) delivers yet again in this suspenseful, hair raisingly chilling account of Devil Worship.
 True, it might have helped feed the frenzy of anti-Wiccan, look behind every repressed childhood memory for pentagrams and blood chalices evidence in numerous '80s court cases, but as cinema, it is a very powerful, scary flick. One can only empathize with what the parents, played by Helen Shaver and Martin Sheen, go through, in the course of the movie. Both are highly convincing in their parts and the script doesn't venture into the banal or the ridiculous, so we the audience are caught up in their dilemma. They are powerless over the forces of darkness, and it is that feeling of hopelessness and dread, which really digs deep into the viewer's psyche, particularly if one is a parent, him/herself.
It's an acuumulative ""you are there,"" ""imagine yourself in their shoes"" experiment in terror. The result is one of the best horror films of the decade.
To give away anything in the way of plot would be a huge disservice to potential viewers. Suffice it to say that the acting is uniformly excellent. You're in the hands of a director who knows how and when to build suspense. At no point do you have to strain to willingly suspend disbelief. Shades of ""Rosemary's Baby,"" but no wholesale lifting. Certainly a lot more believable than ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in the Devil Worshipping scenes. Belongs in every horror afficianado's collection.

It's like that saying, sometimes real life is scarier than fiction. Although, this is not one of those ""based on a true story"" type of movie, this movie was true to life in a lot of ways. Its' content reflected upon 2 very old religions that are very much alive and well in the U.S. and other parts of the world today.

7895101,5,6305812071,"This is an older film that still holds up quite well and puts a lot of the other 'horror' movies put out today to shame. The acting is excellent across the board, and there was a lot of thought that went into the story.  When you actually see the root of all this carnage that happens, and how the victims are selected, it just adds another layer onto an already effective 'sacrifice' thriller. Not too many movies nowadays in the horror genre put as much thought into something that could be both intelligent and fun at the same time. Lots of surprises and creepy moments, esp. Jimmy Smits and Robert Loggia, who become victims themselves in very disturbing ways. Best party dance scene too.

Don't let the 80's release date drive you away either. This is a horror film that builds and offers the viewer something smart and scary.",1481673600,,831,4.570469798657718
