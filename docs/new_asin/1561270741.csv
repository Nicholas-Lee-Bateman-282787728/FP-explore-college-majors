7796126,3,1561270741,"I use segments of this video for my World Music class.  Most indigenous cultures use music for their religious/sacred ceremonies, and this video captures that very well with god possession in Indonesia and a Tromba healing ceremony from Madagascar.  I also like the Hudson Bay Inuit ""throat singing"" when discussing the vocables of American Indian music.  Overall, lots of good stuff from around the world, featuring music in its indigenous context.",1111017600,,449,5.295774647887324
7796127,5,1561270741,"Personal and beautifully crafted. I was not expecting an instuction manual on how to manufacture guitars in the third world (see other review) and so this is not a disappointment. Indeed, for Mr Jeremy Marre's fans, this is a special treat as it is more authored than many of his movies.",999129600,,287,4.647058823529412
7796128,1,1561270741,"This is not an easy video to watch. I was expecting something along the lines of world studies in instrument making, usage and performance. What I got instead was the filming of people possessed by their sect's spirits during bizarre rituals and people dancing about with fake breasts attached to strange attire. Yes, one can see different types of instruments used througout the world, but their uniqueness and purpose is totally ignored. With some escoteric clips of the Bayreuth festival and its wealthy patrons, some unexpected nudity and a vague installment with the conductor John Eliot Gardiner, the video scrapes the bottom of the barrel.
In viewing the tape's third world music offering and even Bayreuth, the music making itself and its intrinsic value takes a back seat to the sensationalism producer Jeremy Marre affords the socialisms, rituals and bizarre costumes. Very poor offering about the ""nature"" of music.",981331200,5,926,5.221476510067114
