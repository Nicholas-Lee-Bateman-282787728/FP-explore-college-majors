8443358,5,B004VGGYM2,"I really enjoyed watching the DVD. If you like history and want to know how the Augusta National Golf Club and the MASTERS were created, you need to purchase this DVD. The stories told about the creators of this great golf course are told by people with first hand accounts who witnessed it being unfolding during that time.",1399766400,,324,4.603448275862069
8443359,5,B004VGGYM2,"This is a great documentary about the Augusta National golf course.  It is very interesting and a ""must watch"" for anyone from Augusta or anyone interested in the Masters Golf Tournament. My father-in-law is about as fanatical about golf as a person can get, and he loved it. He watched it during a weekend we had practice-round tickets to the Masters, so he got to learn about the course's history and then visit the course in person.",1370304000,,435,4.64935064935065
8443360,4,B004VGGYM2,"Based on books by local sports writer Stan Byrdy, this is an excellent video. Perhaps more interesting for those who live in the area as it covers a lot of history about the area itself. This is a ""must see"" for anyone who loves golf and wants to know more about the history of the Augusta National and The Masters.",1318204800,2,315,4.266666666666667
