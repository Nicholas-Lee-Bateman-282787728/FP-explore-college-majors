I bought the 3 DVD set from Stefan Grossmans Guitar Workshop right after I bought my uke in Kauai. The beginner DVD was very good, truly beginner stuff (at least for someone like me who has played guitar for many years), and I'm looking forward to eventually getting to the advanced DVD. The other reviewer complained that he doesn't explain things well, but I really don't agree with that. As someone who is learning an instrument and learning songs, you need to take some responsibility for working through the tab and replaying the parts where you need to. With practice, you'll get it. Highly recommended.",1397606400,,776,4.671532846715328
8543674,3,B009PR5U7C,"This is like having Fred sitting in the room with you playing stuff.  Unfortunately you can't stop him and ask him what he just did, he doesn't go into much detail explaining what he just did and there are no chord or other graphics that illustrate chords or techniques.  I tried looking at his hands but you can't see what he's doing.  I've been playing 'ukulele since 2007 so I'm not exactly a rookie, but I gave up on this about halfway through the DVD.",1368921600,2,456,4.341176470588235
