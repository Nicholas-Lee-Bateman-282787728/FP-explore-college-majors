The charectors are all maddening-I've never been so happy to see people die. The songs are better than you'd expect but they can't save this. There's a galaxy of difference between an unintentially bad movie like ""Glen or Glenda"" and a calculated,deliberately awful movie like this.

1242520,3,B00000K3B3,"'Nudist Colony of the Dead' is one of the funniest low-budget movies I've seen that was intended to be funny. Solidly in the B-movie range, it  nonetheless features a number of A-list laughs!
The film is at once a  parody of slasher-movies, zombie movies, musicals, and preachy After School  Special-type programmes. It opens with one of the funniest courtroom scenes  I've seen... the final battle between a group of nudists and a group of  Christians who want their nudist colony shut down. The nudists lose the  battle... and rather than put on clothes and move elsewhere they choose to  commit ritual suicide. Years later, the Christians have turned the camp  into a Bible retreat for troubled youth, but ""accidents"" keep  happening there, as the dead nudists rise to take gory revenge with each  visit. And all the killing and maiming is framed by pithy little songs! The  ""twist-ending"" required from this kind of horror film is also  pretty cute, all things considered.
There isn't any particularly  noteworthy singing or acting talent on display by any of the performers in  the film, but the lyrics are so hilarious that it doesn't really matter.  (The theme song is dippy but still very funny and it sets the tone for the  film that follows.) Some of the zombie antics are also pretty darn funny,  such as the scene where they kill a girl by pouring cement down her  throat... after putting ear muffs on her sleeping companion so as to not  wake her. However, there are some pacing problems--the film sags in the  middle (nearly as bad as those on the crusty old nudist who casts the curse  that causes the deceased to rise), and they're bad enough to make me knock  off a Star.
All in all, a worthwhile film, but somewhat lacking. If  you're not seeing anything else that interests you and you believe you have  a bizarre sense of humour, check this film out.",969321600,10,1870,4.700617283950617

1242545,3,B00000K3B3,"Nudist Colony Of The Dead sounds like it will be awful, and it is. However, its not what I expected, and its actually somewhat amusing. For one thing, its a musical. The songs are terrible, but the tunes are kind of catchy. Second, its a satire of late-1980s Americanized Christianty, along the lines of Saved (2004). Its not as funny as Saved, but they do try, and its definitely a step above painfully unfunny comedies like Bridesmaids (2011), Jack And Jill (2011), and Hot Pursuit (2015). Finally, I was surprised at just how little nudity there is. I was expecting a cringe-inducing, wooden parade of naked bodies, but theres more nudity on an episode of Game Of Thrones (the first season, anyway: I stopped watching shortly after Sean Bean died). So while I wouldnt call this a _good_ movie, if your expectations are as low as mine were, you might find it okay, or even mildly amusing. But its no Zombie Strippers (which is fantastic, aside from the tedious framing scenes at the beginning and the end).",1502755200,6,1008,4.700564971751413

1242549,3,B00000K3B3,"Nudist Colony of the Dead (Mark Pirro, 1991)

In my rulebook for movies, it says ""you can't go wrong with a movie called Nudist Colony of the Dead"". Yes, it does. Right there, scribbled in the margin of page 3,557. Not surprisingly, the rulebook is right. While this is an amateur production at best, with awful acting, fumbling direction, inconsistent sound and lighting, and every other defect you'd expect a no-budget piece of junk like this to have, I'm not sure it's possible to screw up a premise like this badly enough to make it entirely unwatchable. Simply by its very nature, it's going to be a hoot.

In the opening scene, a judge orders the Sunny Buttocks nudist colony closed down. While most of the members leave, a central group of hardcore nudists decided to drink the Kool-Aid(TM) in protest. (Yes, it's purple.) Fast forward ten years, and the head of the church who were behind the effort to get the place closed down is now using the land as a place to hold retreats for troubled teens. Problem is, the dead rest uneasy, and are apt to pop up whenever evangelicals come round-- though whether they intend to eat the victims or just subject them to bad song and dance is never certain. Because yes, Nudist Colony of the Dead is, among the many other things it is, a musical.

Many of the film's funniest scenes come from Pirro (who also wrote the script) skewering musical conventions here, and the songs themselves are witty, and clever in a way (if you have a really twisted sense of humor, anyway). The jokes are awful through and through, and very politically incorrect in a way few people would dare to do now, but as long as you're not easily offended by, say, redneck jokes, there's a good deal of fun to be had with this flick. Don't go into it expecting Orson Welles, of course. ***",1219190400,,1810,4.54601226993865

If you're looking for bad 80's rap, bad 80's synth music, jr high humor, blatant but not too harsh stereotypes, if you ever wanted to know what kind of things the people who made ABC After School Specials worked on after they snapped...why not?

Again, not much skin or gore in this. I've seen it listed as 'grindhouse.' Not true. Strictly Comedy/Musical with small amounts of skin and blood done in attempts at humor.",1191715200,2,618,4.327586206896552
