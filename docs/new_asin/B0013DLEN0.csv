8250420,4,B0013DLEN0,I enjoyed this video very much only wish it would have covered some of the other 'incidents' and also showed some of the area I served in a little better,1382227200,,153,4.133333333333334
8250421,5,B0013DLEN0,"As I visited North Korea, and am interested in the DMZ, I found this one of the best videos, on the DMZ, including the stuff on you watch on youtube.  I should say I am skeptical of the History Channel, because at times they are like ET. I was not going to order this video, but I was buying several books, so said what the hell.  Glad I did, it is not just ""The Forgotten War,"" this video shows it is the continuing war.",1362614400,,421,4.0
8250422,5,B0013DLEN0,"Few people, except those who were there and the families of the dead, realize that there were ongoing combat operations in Korea in the late 1960's involving American soldiers. The DMZ of Korea is a beautiful, yet dangerous place. However in the late 1960's over 100 American soldiers were killed there in ambushes, raids, and firefights with North Korean commandos who were attempting to infiltrate into and out of South Korea. Their intent was to cause an uprising in South Korea, whereby the South Koreans would overthrow their existing government and drive the Americans out of South Korea (similiar to what the Viet Cong were doing in Vietnam at the same time) and thereby unite with North Korea under communist rule (as eventually happened in Vietnam). This attempt at making South Korea communist did not succeed because the South Koreans hated the communists and they were enjoying the freedoms and prosperity which a capitalistic South Korean government was allowing to take place. In addition the American army stood with the South Korean military to defeat the North Korean attempts to infiltrate into South Korea. How this was accomplished is an interesting story, told in this documentary by John McCain, Henry Kissinger, historians, and by soldiers who were there. I was one of those soldiers. This is our story.",1323820800,3,1326,5.087155963302752
