8117115,1,B000F3Z6JM,"The vhs came to my house quickly, but was packaged in nothing more than a thin plastic bag.  When I opened it up the casing was obviously cracked and and video itself had no volume and the visual flickered on and off.  I could not use it at all and my husband eventually tossed it. I do not get online very often, and so did not try to respond immediately as to the condition or quality of the video, but I should have.  I think I would have loved the work out, had I actually been able to see and hear the whole thing.",1397088000,2,519,3.9711538461538463
8117116,5,B000F3Z6JM,"I am a big fan of Susan Powter. She keeps me wanting more and to stay focus. I wish the VHS was turned into DVD, however it never fails to give me a good sweaty workout. I like how she teaches control, focus on muscles, and instruction on how to perform to make it intense for your level of fitness. I have all the dvds and I switch them around to give variety. Love them all.  This DVD also includes a strength workout for a certain day of the week at the end of cardio session. You can use optional weights and/or chair to help make it more balanced and harder level. It's not too bad to fast forward to th a t day of the week. I just do them straight through for another half hour. So I get 1/2 he each cardio and strength. Like with all her tapes she has you focus your mind in a relax state to realize your fitness goal.  If you love her tapes (which I've used for years) you will also love Jane Fondas first exercise tape (which you cannot get on DVD as well) it's called Jane Fondas workout with Jane Fonda. Beginners section is about 35 minutes and the Advance section is about 95 minutes. Jane is fantastic and excellent in explaining the exercise and correct way to perform it. Check it out also..",1378080000,4,1207,4.153846153846154
8117117,5,B000F3Z6JM,This is one of my favorite workouts. I may try new stuff but I always go back to this one because it gets the job done. I loove Susan she is my favorite instructor. She is more focused on making sure that you actually do the movements correctly. Like Susan says she is not about jumping around like a lunatic and gasping for air. She is about teaching you how to move and breathe correctly so that you can actually get the benefits of cardio exercise. I wish it were on dvd but other than that it one of my go to's.  :-),1360281600,4,520,4.048543689320389
