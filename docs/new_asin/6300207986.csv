7804896,4,6300207986,"I always liked this mid-60's horror film.  Stars actors from the 40's and 50's, now past their prime but giving it their best to a definitely B-grade effort.  A group of folks gather at an isolated Caribbean island for the reading of a will.  Little do they know is that the deceased, who no one liked and liked no one, left some shocking surprises as his legacy.  I have the VHS tape but hopefully a good quality DVD will be released very soon.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre.",1423612800,3,488,4.377777777777778

7804900,2,6300207986,"Your standard assortment of victims arrive at an isolated island castle to attend the reading of the will of Korvik, an unscrupulous industrial baron and scientist.  The twist: Korvik felt that one of them was responsible for  the lab accident that caused his slow, painful death, and nobody inherits  until the others figure out who's the culprit.  The other twist: somebody  who looks a lot like the scarred Korvik is wandering around the castle's  hidden passageways and killing people. This is a pretty standard 40's  ""reading of the will"" murder mystery gussied up with some absurd  science-fiction elements, like a chamber which fills with a gas that  somehow reduces people to skeletons.  Starring Scott Brady and a very down  on her luck Virgina Mayo.",963705600,9,759,5.040322580645161
