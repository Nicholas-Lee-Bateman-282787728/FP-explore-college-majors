8238933,1,B0010X5J8E,"I ordered this hoping to find a biographical film covering R-K's life, featuring historical photographs, incorporating concrete information about the incredible Russian history that he witnessed through his life (and that shaped his life).  Instead, this DVD offered a brief, quasi-atmospheric progression that was fully superficial and based largely on clips of operas from Soviet-era productions, minus supertitles, btw., that conveyed a certain amount of music, but no real sense of the characters, plot, or the reason for the scene's significance. There were pretty, but overly long and dated, atmospheric scenes (a maid in folk dress wandering  through forest, a bubbling brooks, etc.) that were pointless.  The music is nice, but unless one just wants to drift while the video clips of R-K's music plays, don't buy this.  Don't buy this if you want any idea of his real biography or importance.  I was particularly disappointed since many Kulture programs are excellent.  I'd be leery of anything ""biographical"" in this particular series.",1349395200,,1044,5.41358024691358

8238935,2,B0010X5J8E,"The narrator mentions his parents, his wife, and the age of his death.  Still, this work is threadbare on the facts.  For example, they note that he wrote ""Sharazad"" (sp?) and they play a 3-minute clip of it, but that's all.

Too many docs on entertainers become boring slide lectures.  The creators here try to have movement.  For example, they show photos of Rimsky's relatives but they move the camera from the wall where they hang to a busy outside scene.  Old operas are shown with singing and moving performers.

This may keep your interests, but you won't learn much.  That's for sure.",1207785600,2,592,4.679611650485437
