8013417,5,B0001JXPIY,Es una alerta para aquellas mujeres que por amor soportan golpes e insultos deshumanizantes. A veces el amor ciego nos hace cometer estupideces y creer en la persona amada. Felicito al vendedor por su honestidad y eficiencia en el envio.,1313193600,,237,4.95
8013418,5,B0001JXPIY,"I enjoyed this movie, really, it's part of the human culture, the man feels that the woman is a property, then he can do anything without limits. As humans we should know that every experience is wonderful if we share and make some others happy but with this movie I realiced that human is looking for happines somewhere else.
She made me feel that sad and powerless that every abused woman feel all the world arround, not just in Spain, Mexico or America.",1207094400,,456,4.506024096385542
8013419,5,B0001JXPIY,"The typical aberrant behavior of the best known Latin expression ""machismo"" -that fortunately is decreasing- is shown with all the brutal realism.

The sudden transformation of a man who was in love, occurs precisely after knowing his happy wife is pregnant. The gradual tension will be increasing when the violence speech and the physical agressions become normal.

The levels of desperation and slow but effective arousing about the awful reality of this distorted situation will resolve violently. It seems that there is no way out.

Extraordinary script, and fabulous performances, specially in what Paz Vega, the raising and promising Spanish actress concerns.

A theme that securely, will be the cause of similar adaptations in the near future. It is time to open the closed respect this miserable way of behavior.

Bold film!",1132099200,13,832,5.2727272727272725
8013420,4,B0001JXPIY,"I was at the video store and picked this one up on a whim, recently having become an avid foreign film watcher. The movie focuses on a couple (Sergi Lopez and Paz Vega) and their stormy relationship. The two meet at the office where he works and she has just gotten a job. Things start off well. He gets along with her family and friends. She becomes fast friends with his coworker's wife (Elvira Minguez). She becomes pregnant with their first child. He sees that she has been smoking one day and hits her. This is the first signs of the violence that only escalates after the child is born. She confides in her friends and family, who initially play it off, but soon become worried when she starts to show bruises. The two get a divorce but he continues to follow her and, when she tries to get some justice, the court system fails her. She tries to make well with him but comes to the realization that she dislikes him greatly after all he's done,  leading to a climactic ending. Sometimes the melodrama is a bit cheesy, but you can feel her fear as she gets no help from the justice system and must take matters into her own hands. Lopez effectively portrays a man who seems to know he's done wrong, yet can't find a way to change himself. Good performances all around. Worth a viewing.",1092009600,34,1290,4.397489539748954
