5777333,4,B00D8MWW26,"I've been reading some of these reviews and I'm wondering if they are about the same movie I've just seen On Demand. My review may not be as fancy as some of the one's I've just read but I'm someone who likes ghost stories and I really liked this movie.

I first saw the trailer for this movie on You Tube last year and it really peaked my interest. You can imagine my suprise when it popped up On Demand under a different name. I did a little research and found out this is a real little gem.

It's hard to believe they made this movie for the budget they said. Maybe it's some Hollywood thing to create a buzz about how little or how much you spend. I thought the acting was as good as any mainstream movie I've seen. There is one special effect I'm sure cost more than what their budget would allow, it was that good. Did it scare me? I can honestly say I had a pillow up to my face more than once, and a yell or two came out. Someone else reviewed Blair Witch as better. I couldn't watch Blair Witch because it made me nauseous from the hand held camera. I didn't have any problem with this film.

I'm going to be following these guys to see what other movies they come out with. I've already ordered my copy from Amazon for my collection. I gave them a 4 out 5. Should I have given them a 5? The reality of it is, only Stephen King gets a 5.",1376956800,2,1346,4.033707865168539
5777334,5,B00D8MWW26,I liked it.  Gave me several good jumps!!  Acting was good. Ending was kind of predictable though.  Worth renting it.,1376784000,2,117,4.75
5777335,1,B00D8MWW26,"Friday night - excited to settle in for a good horror movie - start the movie annnnnnddd.....no - not a good movie.  I knew we were in trouble from the moment it started.  You can immediately get a sense of where a director is on a scale from how he chooses to employ or not employ music.  Whatever chance the movie had of building suspense of tension is repeatedly ruined by the drone of what sounds like a bad temp score that someone has decided to make more impactful by turning the volume up and down.  I have seen great movies shot digital for no money.  So, it doesn't mean much when someone points out how it was made for no money.  This movie looks as if there was no money and then it had not the talent or innovation to compensate for lack of money.  BLAIR WITCH anyone??  Great movie - no money.  It's nice that friends have stopped by to write nice things and be supportive, but I suggest to those looking for a good indie horror film to keep on looking...",1376611200,42,968,4.217391304347826
5777336,5,B00D8MWW26,"This is a really fun movie. The cinematography was very creative and kept the suspense building. A perfect movie to gather friends and family for on a dark night with some popcorn. I love 'haunted house' stories that don't rely on blood, guts and gratuitous nudity for shock value. This is good story telling and excellent camera work - by the end you'll be jumping at every twist and turn. I saw it in early July and can't wait to see future work from this director.",1375660800,6,467,4.441860465116279
5777337,5,B00D8MWW26,"I saw this film at Shriekfest in LA Oct. 2012, & everyone was on the edge of their seats.  Slow burn that builds to a fantastic ending.  Such creative practical effects that Derek Cole creates--so nice to see an indie that created very real, very intense practical special effects instead of watching another CG big budget eyesore.  Great writing & acting by Stephen Twardokus, & great performances also from Liesel Kopp, Jon Gale & Wendy Haines.",1375488000,4,446,4.842105263157895
5777338,4,B00D8MWW26,"An American Horror Story will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next! Normally, I don't love horror movies, but this one was a welcomed exception. I enjoyed the twists and turns within the plot, and had a good scare at the same time. I have not been able to say that about a film in quite some time, and I would highly recommend giving this film a try!",1374624000,,379,4.135135135135135
5777339,5,B00D8MWW26,Great film for the cost.  If you rent or buy. This is a 1970's 1980's flick. Not like Saw with everyone getting killed out of the gate.  Watch at night with a date. You will love it. Great Job.,1372204800,,193,3.923076923076923
5777340,5,B00D8MWW26,"This movie was awesome! It is highly suspenseful. Derek is brilliant in his editing, lighting, cinematography and the way he captivates his audience with his technic which creates a totally suspenseful phenomena!!! Cain brings in the comic relief and turns out to be more than just a supporting actor. A must see!!!",1372204800,3,315,5.076923076923077

5777342,1,B00D8MWW26,"I'm a fan of horror films. Some films in the ghost story genre that I feel are very effective (off the top of my head) are The Changeling (1980), The Others (2001), Paranormal Activity (2007), The Conjuring (2013) and It Follows (2014). I found An American Ghost Story film to be repetitive and boring and overly dependent on music stings to provide scares. The cinematography/lighting has little flair. The camera work is steady and in-focus and I don't recall seeing any boom mics drop into the shot, I really can't say much more than that. Overall the film is inoffensive but forgettable.",1469577600,,591,4.803921568627451

5777351,5,B00D8MWW26,"It gets good, so keep watching.  The movie is about a guy who wants to experience ghost by renting the house where a family was murdered (which is sick), but there wasn't any gore.  There weren't any R rated scenes and few cuss words, but if you let the kids watch this, they'll be sleeping in your room permanently.

I started watching and almost turned it off because the movie is obviously low budget, but I'm glad I didn't because I ended up really enjoying it.  The characters were curious about events and sometimes amusing, but not stupid (other than renting a haunted house).  The director was a master at building suspense and it had multiple creepy moments.  I sat there watching it and was living those creepy scenes.  It definitely had my hair standing up.

My wife and the kids were visiting grandparents for the evening, so the setting for watching this was perfect and it ended well.  When the main character got mad and tried to catch a ghost with a sheet, I thought, ""Oh no. Here goes the movie.""  It was funny until something happened.  You won't look at bed sheets the same.",1444780800,,1093,4.525510204081633

5777356,4,B00D8MWW26,"Looks like a lot of folks rating this were complaining the scares in this movie were too subtle, but I think that this was precisely what made it so frightening. My only problem w/this movie was that this guy didn't ever turn on the bloody lights. That's the first thing people do when something creepy happens at night.  Silly man deserves to be haunted. Also interesting that it was a man, I think that made it more frightening, something different than the typcial ""distraught female sees ghosts"" scenario.  Was fun. I even turned on a light or two.",1443571200,,552,4.622448979591836
5777357,3,B00D8MWW26,"Its OK! I have seen lower budget films with more camera effects. The acting was also pretty bad. I mean I hate saying it was bad, im sure it was a huge role for the people who got the role, just very beginner.

I WANTed to believe you, I really did... but you just refused to let me :(  Lastly, he was suppose to be writing a book, or did I miss something?

5777412,1,B00D8MWW26,"Full disclosure - I couldn't finish this awful movie. I am in shock that someone actually got money from another human being in order to film this. It is, without a doubt, the worst schlock I've seen in a long time.

The basic plot is so generic you'd expect to find it in a twelve-pack at Costco. It's so generic, in fact, that they don't really bother to give you things like motivation or personality of the characters. It's assumed that you know these things already. Paul is the generic writer character, looking for a ghost story. His girlfriend is the generic love interest, wanting to leave well enough alone and stop ghost hunting. She weakly and meekly suggests that Paul perhaps NOT decorate the entire house the way the dead family did. After that, she doesn't really get to have opinions. Of course, Paul ignores her, and the ghosts appear so he can write about them. But - oooo! - he gets more than he bargained for!

As others have pointed out, the actors woodenly deliver lines towards each others' faces, without any real feeling behind them. The movie is full of awkward pauses and too-close shots that linger. I honestly can't tell if this is due to the actors being so bad they didn't know their lines, or if the script actually called for it. Regardless, the movie pads out nearly thirty minutes longer than it should. Far from building tension in these lengthy pauses, the whole thing comes across as amateur in all the worst ways.",1433894400,,1453,4.6061776061776065

It is a mature, dark tale that keeps with an ominous tone through the whole film allowing for a tense apprehension for the viewer. The acting is somber, melodrama that draws you into the shadowy life of the protagonist as he faces the true error of his decision to move into the home. There is a black veil over the atmosphere of this movie almost from the start. No cheeky, campy, light-heartedness here! The story is a chilling, episodic nightmare that is executed nearly perfectly by the actors and director.

The film quality and sound effects in An American Ghost Story are pretty tight, even with the stripped down, lower budget nature that is utilized. The film proves you don't need a massive budget or fancy effects to pull off a good ghost story. There were moments that I jumped and moments I found myself holding my breath over what was coming next. It is a truly spooky, sometimes scary film. The story plays out in an almost somber, haunting way that allows for a natural build of suspense and intensity. The further into the film you get the more creepy and thrilling it becomes. I did find the ending a tad hokey, but really there is no real way to end a ghost story, horror film that doesnt feel a bit over-done and redundant. That being said An American Ghost Story ends with a dark, chilling finality that is almost not an ending at all, only a break in an ongoing horror saga-to be continued-maybe.

An American Ghost Story is an indie thriller that holds its on to any bigger budget supernatural horror film and well worth watching. It is a mature, well written story. The acting is above the standard for lower budget horror films and the sound effects fit perfectly. The atmosphere of the film is spooky and provides an eerie tone to the film. I enjoyed An American Ghost Story more than I anticipated and even though the film doesnt really add anything new to the sub-genre it is still a very good addition to the horror genre. I think any horror fan and especially fans of ghost stories will enjoy this film.",1432512000,,2387,4.523148148148148

There aren't many supernatural horror movies out there that have a genuinely scary moment without getting into the demonic/possession/exorcism area.  This one had a ghost that was genuinely creepy....especially *spoiler alert* when he slid under the sheet and looked up and there was nothing there.  I thought it was well done, just for that.

BUT, I was pleasantly surprised (or scared!). This was a really creative movie! There are NO, let me repeat NO cheesy CGI effects or stupid computer generated black masses with faces. It seemed like every scary moment was generated using real special effects! A trick that they did often that I really appreciated and kept me tense waiting for the next moment, was all of the teasing. They have obviously studied other horror movie moments and tried to replicate them in individual scenes, but...they never actually do anything. They just set up the shot, let you get scared, anticipating something jumping out at you, and then NOTHING HAPPENS. They do this over and over. The camera shots were creative as well, always catching natural reflections off mirrors, or pictures, floors, etc, that draw your eye...you're expecting to see something that's not supposed to be there...,and....then another tease! I love being teased, I really appreciated it! There were also no fake cheesy CGI shadows that have become so popular in horror these days. This movie wasn't overdone at all. *potential spoiler* The scariest bit for me was the flashlight scene. (You'll see what I mean). *end potential spoiler* It was just so well done!

For instance, since the film makers could not afford make-up or special effects, all the ""ghost"" scenes involved sheets. It was an obvious gimmick and not a serious plot tool as I hoped. But there are some shots where the sheets are effectively creepy.
And for super-low-budget thrills, my favorite scene is where a ghost takes a man's flashlight and starts playing with it. Sounds silly, and it is VERY easy to shoot... but in context it was the most terrifying moment of the film.
All I'm saying is, give it a chance. We liked it, but I can imagine a much more selective audience would grumble at the first scene and turn it off forever. Just try it.",1416355200,,884,4.496894409937888

The actors were not the greatest, but you rarely find truly great actors in the genre.  They were adequate.  The story was built slowly and leaned to.  Things happened over a three month period and developed much like the former tenant described.  Much of the time the scare would come after the disturbing part was over.  Example after the main character is following children's voices around the house.  He gets an email from his bud with the stupid jump scare that everyone has gotten in there own email.  There are complaints about bedsheets ghosts, but they were done effectively and were rather cool.  The only real annoyance was the ending of the ending.

5777552,5,B00D8MWW26,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. As an inveterate scary movie aficionado, I tend to set the bar pretty high for creepiness. At the start of the movie, I was immediately drawn in by the cinematography, the shot angles, the composition, the colors and textures, and the original score. They all contribute to the creepy factor in this movie. And creepy it is. From the beginning there is the typical anticipatory atmosphere. Anyone who is a fan of ghost story movies, (Paranormal Activity, Poltergeist, The Conjuring) knows what to expect. First the strange noises, then doors opening on their own and objects moving in the night, then the inevitable close encounter of the eerie, hair-raising kind with a heart pounding climax, followed by sighing relief that turns to one last scare at the very end. What makes this movie so special for me is the up close and personal aspect of many of the scenes. The main character, Paul (Stephen Twardokus) is very likable with an open, expressive face. We watch him make the transition from hopeful and eager to experience something life-changing and transformative to frustrated and angsty to, eventually, terrified and haunted. His dramatic rendering made me feel as though I was seeing and experiencing every weird, disturbing moment in that house with him. His was the stellar performance of the movie for me. The other actors were effective, but clearly only supportive to his lead. There was sufficient tension created by his responses to the menacing actions of the spirit to make me nearly jump out of my seat a time or two. I think the most sinister moment for me was near the end when the sheet-clad form slowly turns his head toward Paul. That most definitely gets a 10 on the creepy scale from me. Having said all that, I must admit, this isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen but it is truly a diamond in the rough. What it lacks in sophistication it makes up in atmosphere. I hope to see more from Stephen Twardokus and Derek Cole in the future.",1401148800,2,2008,4.756446991404012

A few tenants are scared out of the home which gets Pauls interest who then decides to move him and his girl into tje house so he can write a book on the hauntings.

The fun starts there. The name of the movie alone should have hinted that its basically a rip off of other scary movies (obviously a play on American Horror Story) . The sheet thing was most likely inspired by Paranormal Activity among other things such as ""day 95"" writyen on the screen to track how many days have passed.

I am not a picky movie watcher and even enjoy laughing at lame B movies.  But most of this wasn't even laughable it was just painfully boring until the last 10 minutes which were cliche and made un scary by the lame music.

Last but not least the acting was AWFUL! Very little emotion from any actor and any attempt at emotion is terribly over dramatic. Pauls face barely changes througout the movie.

5777560,5,B00D8MWW26,"For all its perceived weaknesses, An American Ghost Story succeeds where scores of other horror films  --  armed with computer-generated graphics, special effects and blood and gore  -- have failed: Namely, to produce a bona fide, spine-tingling, and scary movie.

An American Ghost Story has achieved this rare feat by skillfully employing film-noir techniques of light and shadow, a minimum of spoken dialogue that forces the viewer to follow the action in the movie, and elements of tricking the movie viewer.

The movie involves the story of a newspaper writer who rents a house where the grisly murder of a family occurred. The writer, the main character of the film, seeks to investigate rumors of the house being haunted and recording his experiences in a book. His girlfriend abandoned him early in the film, and despite small experiences of the ghosts, doggedly stays in the house until ""sometime big"" happens. That big climax indeed happens, with surprising results.

The producers of the film accomplish this genuine thriller with the simple technique of using sheets, furtive movements, and genuine suspense. Sheets for ghosts? You may say in this age of computer animation this might appear retro or rather lame. But as applied in this movie, you will be surprised how amazingly effective it is at scaring the wits out of you. It is cinematic equivalent of someone jumping out from the bushes and saying ""Boo!""

This is a perfect horror film. It is a small production, there is no blood and gore. Aside from the family who was killed before the action in this movie, no one else is murdered or slaughtered. There are no special computer graphics which end up looking phoney anyway.  Here, less is better, and it works very effectively.",1395532800,,1748,4.962328767123288

Being a huge fan of horror films in general, I remembered that I had come across it previously here on Amazon.  The reviews had started out badly but eventually there were some defenders, so I thought, hey, for under $2.00, sure!

I actually did enjoy this film.  I'm female and thought the lead actor was very cute!  :-)  Ha, but seriously...This is a pretty low budget one, yes.  No Ghosthouse Pictures/Lionsgate, no.  The plot, concerning a man and his girlfriend that purposely move into a supposedly haunted house and try to communicate with the spirits, was entertaining.  The film definitely has it's jump moments.  I have seen many, many horror films, and let me tell you, this movie actually had one of the BEST jump moments I have seen in a horror movie since the cabinet scene in ""Paranormal Activity 2""!!  It definitely ""Got Me""!  I totally didn't even see that coming!

But yes, there is a sheeted ghost, which I thought was extinct in film since the 1950s. When that part happened, it was actually creepy at first but then turned...funny!  Unintentionally I guess, but, heck, I was laughing, beer in hand, entertained the entire time!  So, I guess it depends on what you're looking for.  :-)

This is a plain and simple low budget ghost story. It was well scripted and directed. Stephen Twardokus who wrote and produced the film was weakest as an actor. They should of had someone else in that role. The story line is simple without any twists. The intent of the film is to scare, i.e. make you jump. It tries to this a dozen or so times, and actually made me jump once, something I don't normally do in the daylight and sober. Don't expect a great horror tale, just a good ghost movie for the sleep over.

What we know about the ghost: It can throw a basketball, but can't hit the rim. It can stack chairs, but can't decorate. It can turn on a radio, but has trouble changing stations. And it must be a male because it leaves the draws open.

From the reviews I read, this was supposedly a really scary movie. It didn't scare me at all. Oh sure, there were some cheap jump scenes, but cheap jump scenes do not make a movie. I understand that the movie was low budget, and didn't expect the frills of a well-funded film, which I often actually prefer. What I don't understand is how this could be labeled a horror movie at all. I could hardly sit through it. I also appreciate the type of film with a slow build-up and a smashing climax. This, however, was not one of those. The acting was terribly rigid and unnatural, and that goes for all of the actors in this film. The haunting scenes were far from haunting, the actors didn't really look scared, the dialogue was a huge yawn, and the story was not well developed. In the end we are left with a bunch of moving toys and formed sheets that did nothing to frighten me and more to make me lament my purchase of this rental.

5777584,1,B00D8MWW26,"Stunningly dull and thoroughly awful attempt at a Paranormal Activity film but without the camcorder gimmick.  Or the few minutes genuine suspense that each Paranormal Activity movie offers.  Or the competent acting and special effects.

The story concerns a young couple who move into a supposedly haunted house because the man wants to write a book about it.  If that sounds like the set-up for Sinister all I can say is that before too long you will wish this movie was a rip-off of Sinister--at least then there would be a plot and stuff would actually happen.

The woman flees the house after an amusing encounter where she backs out of the kitchen slowly, trying to look terrified as cabinets open around her.  Well, it's a haunted house--what did she think was going to happen?

The problem is that this leaves her boyfriend in the house alone waiting for something scary to happen.  Occasionally a title appears on-screen to remind us of how long he's been in the house with absolutely nothing happening.  The lead actor has a face for radio and no acting ability whatsoever but he also wrote the screenplay, which I guess explains how he got the part.

Eventually the filmmakers decided the boredom had to end so all hell breaks loose, more or less.  The one good effect the filmmakers came up with was a ghost rising from the sheets on the bed beside the hero when he wasn't looking and didn't notice.  The ""terrifying"" finale involves the ghost in the sheet chasing the hero around the house.  The problem is that the effect doesn't work--when the ghost is running around it becomes really, really obvious that it's actually someone under a sheet and it looks completely ridiculous.

It's hard to believe that it didn't occur to writer/star Stephen Twardokus to include any plot whatsoever--there's no attempt to figure out exactly who the ghost is or what it wants, if anything.  A family was murdered in the house--supposedly a murder suicide where the father killed his family then himself.  Is the father the ghost?  The kid?  Are there multiple ghosts?  Is it possible that the father didn't kill his family after all and it was really the shifty landlord who doesn't want to set foot inside the house?

None of this occurs to the hero who wants to write a book about the house but seems to have no curiosity whatsoever about what might be happening in it.

An American Ghost Story is boring and pathetically dull except for the couple of scenes that are unintentionally amusing. Avoid even if you like bad horror movies because this isn't a fun bad horror movie--it's too slow and lazy to feel like anything other than a vanity project that never should have seen the light of day.",1386460800,2,2698,4.71002132196162
5777585,4,B00D8MWW26,"I must preface my review with a statement:  AN AMERICAN GHOST STORY is not what I was expecting, and that is certainly a good thing.  After the first 10 minutes, I was expecting to hate it...the acting is not that great and the story sounded very generic.  BUT...I am sooooo glad that I finished it because this film is actually a top notch ghost story that made me jump on several occasions.  It is not a big budget picture, so the acting can be overlooked; but where it lacks in budget, it makes up for with innovative style and excellent scares.

I read several negative reviews about this film after I watched it, and I can see where some of those reviewers were coming from.  The actors are not of the highest caliber and the story is a bit slow in some parts.  But if you can overlook both of those, you're in for a real treat here.

AN AMERICAN GHOST STORY is shot well for a low-budget feature and has some nifty camerawork throughout.  Surprisingly, there is no gore in this film at all, however the rest of the special effects (specifically, the ghost scenes) are well done and very creative.  Whereas some films use CG or even regular animation to show the ghosts, director Derek Cole bends the genre mold a bit and decides not to show them...technically (you just have to watch the film to understand).  This, in turn, creates an even more haunting atmosphere in which to scare the audience.

And the scares are nice!  Theres a lot of tension built into the story and the character of Paul does a great job of fleshing it out.  His obsessive quest to interact with the spirits ultimately leads to bad things, which we get to see and enjoy.  The buildup is a bit slow at times, but once things start going, they don't really stop.

Unfortunately, I cant give AN AMERICAN GHOST STORY a perfect rating.  The acting in some aspects really is downright terrible.  I hate to point fingers at individuals, but Liesel Kopp does not do a good job in her role.  I feel like she spends more time trying to avoid eye-contact with the camera and less time acting.

But that is a mild downside for such an effective horror flick.  Look past the rough exterior and see the gem that lies within AN AMERICAN GHOST STORY.  I recommend giving this one a shot.  You will probably never look at bedsheets the same way again!",1385424000,2,2315,4.446555819477434

I agree that parts of the movie were unnecessary and actually disrupted the flow.  Yes, the the use of music to startle may have also been overdone -- but, it did make jump!.  And I also thought the sheet ghosts totally lacked subtlety and were cheesy . . . you saw too much of it and it detracted from the scare-factor.  HOWEVER, I found parts of the movie REALLY scary, moments that were almost unbearably tense ( I was watching at night) in a very subtle way! Maybe some of the reviews lowered my expectations, but I actually enjoyed this movie. No special effects, no gore, just old fashioned spooky what-will-happen-next stuff.

5777600,1,B00D8MWW26,"If this were on free streaming I would say maybe watch a few minutes and see for yourself, but since it is on paid streaming I felt that I should really explain how bad this movie really is. To begin I would like to make it clear that I am a fan of low budget films, and I think that certain allowances for them could be made, so my review will reflect this. This film is one of the worst films I have ever watched. It's one of those few films that fall into the black hole of being bad, but not so bad that it's enjoyable, which makes it a huge chore to watch. At best this movie is bland; at worst it's downright annoying. The background music is nothing but a constant repetition of the same few notes, only changing when the scene was supposed to be tense, therefore removing all tension from the scene, then culminating with a loud jump scare, which usually can't even startle.  The script is more a long string of outdated horror movie tropes tied together with wooden dialogue. As other reviews have stated, they used the chair stacking from Poltergeist, the ghost under a sheet from the Scooby Doo cartoon, and the random sounds from every uncreative horror film.

The movie seems to have been filmed with good cameras and microphones, but the lighting is excessively dark, seriously dark to the point where we stopped the movie and tried another movie to make sure our TV wasn't damaged.

This movie is very boring, and its running time has been extended with an inordinately large amount of lingering shots, and multiple views of a single scene, this movie could easily drop thirty or forty five minutes with proper editing.

I will conclude my review with the final and most grievous problem, the cast. I honestly didn't know who was the most bored, me and my wife or the cast of the film. The main actor delivers all of his lines with the vigor of an Ambien, and with the same bored expression. Only occasionally does he make the effort to say something louder or grunt and breathe hard. The rest of the cast isn't much better, but they don't warrant much mention since they are in hardly enough scenes to get on your nerves. Overall I would say this was less a movie and more a challenge to make a horror film that could replace a cup of warm milk on a sleepless night, and on that level it succeeded.",1381017600,28,2314,4.412177985948477

5777602,3,B00D8MWW26,"I thought the movie was above average for this genre of spook movies.  The acting was good and the use of noise on the sound tract had made for some unnerving moments. It brought back memories of myself, covering my eyes with my hand to block my sight from what was surely to follow in the next second or two on the screen.  That was when I was a teenager... except new memories were made since the same action was applied tonight when watching this film. There was suspense all right.  To me the only draw back was the lead actor.  He acted much too average for the average ""Joe"" in the movie who was the main character in the film. I can understand why some of the audience didn't really take to him.  He seemed a little insipid.  Sorry.  That was the only flaw to the film I picked up on.

If you are into slash and gash this is not the movie for you.  The director created a wonderful dark atmosphere for a traditional ghost story without the old melodrama routine.  The movie was true to form about hauntings and it was very realistic.

For all of you thinking this form of a haunting is too tame, it may seem tame if you are not experiencing it first hand.  But, that is the way the story usually reads.  Noise, bumps in the night, or perhaps a attempted communication and a glimpse out of the corner of your eye.  In this movie, he didn't just get a glimpse.  He got a good look at what makes a negative entity really tick.

The camera work is professional and imaginative, the script tight with interesting characters, and the acting convincing. This modern suburban home looks so conventional and boring, but lighting, camera angles, sound and great emoting by writer/star Stephen Twardokus, Wendy Haines and Liesel Kopp make you want to see what happens next in each scene.

Director Derek Cole makes Mr. Twardokus' script really convince you this house might be genuinely haunted using some spare but quite effective special effects. The tone is kept consistent and the main characters are likable without being cloying. The low budget was actually probably a virtue because what the director and writer have come up with is as frightening as the no budget Night of the Living Dead was to it's first audiences back in 1968.

For a ghost story to work you have to believe two things:1)the main character is worth caring about, and 2)she or he is really being attacked by a supernatural entity. Twardokus makes you believe this quirky guy is driven to such an obsession he would stay in this hellish place despite it's obvious danger towards the end. Director Cole makes you believe those cabinets, chairs, and sheet really are possessed by something very real and very dangerous.

5777622,3,B00D8MWW26,"I have to confess that I enjoyed this film, but I wish that I had been able to enjoy it more. It's based on a rather tired premise (young broke couple need to live in a place that hasn't rented because of its reputation). It's not, strictly speaking, a ""found footage"" film, but it has many of the attributes: shaky camera work, odd non sequiturs, a feeling of inadequate scripting...

The acting was passable, but with more than one wooden moment: the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" was elusive. Liesel Kopp, as ""Stella"", the girl-friend was inordinately weak in a role that cried out for more depth and complexity. Her performance was more indicative of directorial inexperience than any lack of talent. This was exacerbated by a script that needed some professional editing.

"":Special"" effects, such as they were, were inadequate, and suggested a budget that was barely capable of covering the cost of equipment rental. The ""ghost"" effects were clich (how many times since ""Paranormal Activity"" do we have to see kitchen cupboards exploding open?) - and, I'm sorry, but a ghost that does its haunting covered by a bedsheet is simply below the level necessary to carry any weight. Unfortunately, the ""ghost"" played by Shane Cole (presumably a close relative of the director's), managed, despite a complete absence of dialogue, to seem bombastic and over-acted.

Thank you for a thrilling movie that did not need the use of blood and guts to make me jump and cringe. I look forward to seeing more works from these two.",1377561600,3,409,3.9397590361445785
5777624,4,B00D8MWW26,"If you know what you are going into, being a next-to-no budget haunted house story, the film turns out to be surprisingly atmospheric and effectively creepy.  It's just the right run time and the filmmakers cleverly make use of classic ghost scares via sound design and practical effects.  Very pleasant surprise.  I will be looking forward to the directors next effort.",1377388800,,370,5.032786885245901
5777625,3,B00D8MWW26,"My review in a sentence: worth watching.

It is clear to me that the crew who worked on this movie are fans of classic, straightforward, haunted house flicks.  The story has all of the foundations that make it familiar - family is slaughtered, leaving their spirits behind to torment the main character(s) after they move into the house.  In keeping with horrors gothic roots, the characters are archetypes, but with enough idiosyncrasies that allow them to stand out and make this a unique story.  The cinematography and music really add to a tense, eerie atmosphere that, unlike much of today's big-budget horror films, actually feels haunted.  The pacing is appropriate for its intended audience.  An American Ghost Story doesn't pander to the SAW crowd, and those with short attention spans will be turned off by the film's slow burn.  For those of us who grew up reading ghost stories, however, this film will feel just right and when those moments of fright kicked in, you'll feel like you really earned them.

Although you can likely guess exactly how the story will play out, I'll make one comment that I feel should be tagged as a spoiler:

*****SPOILER*****
I am full of elephants.  No, just kidding.  What I meant to say is that there is no mystery in this movie, and that comes with a sigh of relief.  No character spends any time following the bread crumbs of lonely specters, as Paul rents the house knowing full well that if he sees ghosts, they're of the murdered family.  It's one thing to have a neat mystery from time to time, but that's one cliche horror could easily use less.  If I were to guess, supernatural mysteries are going to be more common with female protagonists, especially ones that remain true to their intuitions despite being blocked by domineering, untrusting males (usually, a husband and/or a doctor).  That archetype would make for an interesting psychology or gender studies research paper, and maybe some day I'll actually do that myself.  Anyways, this has been a bit of rambling to further obscure the unnecessarily tagged spoiler that probably doesn't ruin the movie at all.
*****End of SPIOLER*****

While I like the movie a lot, I knock off two stars.  One star gets bagged and tossed in the river because the dialog is very poorly written.  Characters will have either unexplained knowledge (or the lack of it), and they make leaps in logic that no clear-thinking person would make.  The second star gets drawn and quartered because the movie clearly shows one of the characters having a strong connection with the house, but leaving the details of that relationship to the imagination of the viewer.  When we see something on the screen, it is the director who puts it there, and if they don't make use of that, it's a waste of time.  Imagine that a character walks on set, and the camera zooms into his shifty eyes, then zooms out to follow the character back off-set.  I don't know about you, but I'm not just left with questions, but a bright, shining 'WTF?!' floating above my head.  WTF-halos annoy me, so star #2 pays the ultimate price.

All in all, this really is a good movie.  It's indie, and money equalling time, you have to give it allowances for the acting not being perfect.  Esthetically, it's very pleasing.  Technically, it's an achievement worth being proud of.  And honestly, it's a good, classic horror movie.  Unfortunately, it's also got some personality issues that prevent this good film from being really great.",1377302400,3,3487,4.802013422818792
5777626,1,B00D8MWW26,That was horrible. I couldn't make it past the first thirty minutes. I'm pretty sure this movie was made by high school students. That's the nicest thing I can say.,1377216000,13,164,4.5
5777627,4,B00D8MWW26,"This is a great little horror film with an excellent cast and crew! We need more good ghost stories and this definitely fits the bill: An intelligent haunting film that doesn't pander to the audience, The scares are genuine and bone-chilling. I'm still amazed that with such a low budget the film is so technically sound. When watching this I couldn't help but think of the enthusiasm and respect this group (of geniuses) must have for what makes a good horror film. I highly recommend seeking this one out! I'm very happy to add this to my collection as well as spread the word about it to all my friends!",1377216000,,606,4.5181818181818185
5777628,3,B00D8MWW26,"My husband & I watched the trailer, and this movie looked like it had potential. Well, the trailer showed the best parts(like most do). The movie was very slow with too many fillers, not enough ghostly substance.
The storyline itself was good,but it was filmed poorly with bed sheets as ghosts & chairs piled on a table(like in Poltergeist). I mean.....really??!!! Give us a break! Not much imagination with the filming of this story. There were a couple of jumpy scenes,but nothing to brag about. Not worth the $3.99 rental here on Amazon. Huge disappointment!!!",1377216000,25,563,4.936842105263158
5777629,1,B00D8MWW26,I kept waiting for the movie to be scary but it never happened. There were so many opportunities for this movie to make you jump or give you shivers up your spine but every single time they managed to screw that up. Recommended only if bed sheets scare you.,1377216000,19,257,4.26530612244898
5777630,2,B00D8MWW26,"The setup was well done but the payoff was laughable; kudos for the effort.  The creators definitely know rule number one:  build suspense, then pull the trigger.  Except here, the trigger pull was quite underwhelming.  Perhaps next movie?",1377043200,3,239,5.2105263157894735
8590622,4,B00D8MWW26,"This one had everything I look for in a good horror movie.  The suspense was strong and the creep factor was just right.  There were even enough jump scares for the teens.  I've heard some say the sheet thing was stupid, but I totally disagree.  It was done so well that it wasn't a distraction at all.  There were a few too many minutes of nothing special going on, but not to the point of rolling my eyes.  Overall a good horror flick.",1530057600,,437,4.204819277108434
8590623,4,B00D8MWW26,"A new twist on a haunted house movie. The new tenants know going in that the house is haunted and they actually want it to be! It starts out kinda slow, but that's the way all good haunted house movies start! Acting, camera and special effects are all well above par. Recommend for haunted house movie fans! No blood or gore though, so if that's what you're looking for, look somewhere else.",1528156800,,391,4.444444444444445

8590627,5,B00D8MWW26,"The premise for this movie was intriguing, so I rented it. It exceeded my wildest expectations; it's easily one of the best thrillers I've seen in a very long time. I know we all have our own way of judging things, but this movie has one of the greatest jump scares I've ever seen. And the scares just keep coming, one after the other. Very few movies have gotten me on edge and kept me there as well as this one did. When you consider that the entire budget for this film is estimated to be $10,000 (yes, you read that right: ten thousand dollars), what they did is infinitely better than the major studios spending a hundred million or more. I asked my video store to sell it to me, but they wouldn't. So I found one on Amazon and bought it. If I had a top 10 of all movies regardless of genre, this movie is solidly in that 10.",1504742400,,830,4.12962962962963
8590628,4,B00D8MWW26,"Though not perfect, I really enjoyed this film. I'm not a fan of slasher/blood/gore type movies, and most Hollywood produced ghost stories leave me disappointed.  I find a movie about ghosts effective for one reason - does it give me the creeps?  Does it get under my skin and stay with me, long after I've seen it?  There were a few eerie scenes in this film that did just that.  It was obviously low budget, which some people don't like.  And it did resort to a few old tricks, such as the overdone kitchen cabinets opening thing, and the chairs stacked up, like in the first Poltergeist and too many other movies.  But I thought a lot of it was very original, and the part where he was woken up in the middle of the night and heard the children whispering about him - that was really creepy!  Some things I didn't understand - like why he used a flashlight all the time Instead of turning on the damn lights....but, for the most part, it was an entertaining movie!

If you liked it, there is another low budget film that l think is worth checking out, it's called ""Deadly Presence""",1498348800,,1084,4.385

8590631,2,B00D8MWW26,It was so boring I slept through some of it.  I was expecting it to be more scarier based on previews but the previews is basically the entire movie.  Not worth the money to rent or buy.  I don't usually give bad reviews on movies but this one really warrants it.,1486857600,,263,4.117647058823529
