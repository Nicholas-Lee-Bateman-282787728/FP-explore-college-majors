2008012,4,B0001KCI5E,"Commissioned by London Weekend Television (LWT) in 1975, TWO'S COMPANY starred the divine Elaine Stritch as Dorothy McNab, an American mystery novelist living and working in London, who takes on the stuffy, oh-so-teddibly British Robert (Donald Sinden) as her butler.  Sparks fly when Dorothy, who is under the false belief that everyone is meant to have equal footing in this life, is ""instructed"" by Robert in the correct way (ie: HIS way) of running a household.  Madly bashing away at the typewriter, Dorothy needs an organised and relaxed home life...but she never counted on tightly-wound Robert.  Just WHO is the help and who is the boss?!

Wickedly scripted by Bill MacIllwraith, TWO'S COMPANY offered viewers of British comedy something a little more sophisticated and biting than the usual fare, with the humour extending from the dry wordplay between Dorothy and Robert.  The show came during one of Elaine Stritch's most prolific periods of her professional career.  She had chiefly relocated to London for the successful West End transfer of ""Company"", but decided to stay in the country on a full-time basis when she married English actor John Bay.  Setting up housekeeping at the Savoy Hotel no less, Stritch was the darling of the London talk show circuit, starred as Aunt Polly in a miniseries of ""Pollyanna"" for the BBC, and of course remained as the acerbic Dorothy for three more series of TWO'S COMPANY.

Series 1 of TWO'S COMPANY includes the following episodes:

""The Bait"" - Dorothy McNab's in the market for a butler...but with Robert, has she won the lottery or landed the booby-prize?

""The Housekeeping"" - Robert needs more cash to run the various household expenses (not to mention a healthy interest in the racetrack), but Dorothy decides to hold firm to her original plan...

""Dorothy's Electrician"" - Some fancy new wall lights are all ready to be installed.  It's the beginning of another ordeal for Dorothy and Robert...

""The Patient"" - The joys of the public health system.  Robert falls down the stairs and an anxious Dorothy accompanies him to the hospital emergency room...  Guest starring Penelope Keith!

""The Romance"" - Dorothy's new would-be boyfriend is on the prowl, and it's Robert's day off...

""Robert's Mother"" - Like mother like son?  Dorothy is intrigued when Robert's mother drops by for a visit...",1277769600,,2350,5.05974025974026
2008013,4,B0001KCI5E,"I had never seen (or even heard of!) this series before happening upon it on Amazon. I was a bit leery to try it because of the reviews I've seen by most Anglophiles (lovers of English culture) here on Amazon. They all seem to think that Black Adder and Fawlty Towers are the best of British comedy and I cannot STAND those two series. Personally I am an Allo Allo/Keeping Up Appearances/Mr. Bean/To The Manor Born/The Piglet Files/The Good Life (called Good Neighbors in America) kind of person and those two particular comedies get on my nerves in the worst way.

That being said, I weighed the risks carefully in trying this but the price suddenly became right and I took a chance. I wouldn't have lost too much if I did. The verdict: this series is surprisingly good. There are some dry non-funny bits and I compared it a bit to Kate and Allie in a way - interesting to watch but only a laugh here and there. The really funny bits are totally hilarious though. My favourite episodes are a toss up between The Patient (guest starring Penelope Keith who I adore) and Robert's Mother; and The Patient just slightly wins this one because of this amazingly funny scene when Robert is being examined by an Indian doctor and Dorothy keeps asking Robert, ""What did he say? What did he say?"" Very reminiscent of Harry McCool (Cool McCool's dad). So I was completely cracking up partly because of that memory. Kurt A Johnson's review is pretty accurate on the episode descriptions.

This is just a basic DVD with no extras. The menu is short and sweet. You have the option to Play All or Play by Episode and you also get the Cast Filmography. I suppose you can call that an ""extra"" if you're really desperate :) You just  get episodes 1 to 6. The video is pretty clear for something that's been filmed in the 70's, and the soundtrack is generally clear although there are some times when the sound dips down so you can hardly hear what the characters are saying and then raises again back to normal level. Odd, but I guess it's built into the DVD...i.e. nothing to do with the player. Also this set is NOT LABELLED as closed captioned, neither does it have subtitles. It seems to be fullscreen to me and NOT widescreen as the product description states. The theme song's pretty atrocious but I guess you can chalk it up to ""charm"" if you so desire. Other than that, no complaints. I'm happy I took the chance on this and am just going to pick up the second series to see if it's as hilarious as the first.

Now leesten carefully, I shall say this only once....It still can't touch Allo Allo though. THAT is my favourite Britcom of ALL time!",1202428800,,2634,4.46985446985447
2008014,3,B0001KCI5E,"I titled the review Broadway as I felt I was in the theatre and observing a play in action on the stage.  One of the actors in this television series is primary a stage actor which one can tell.  Their pronunication of the word is exact and the voice very strong.  Their presents on the set was that on the stage.  Television flows differently and that flow did not exist.  The story lines were good in the beginning, but as the series continued, they bogged down in content.",1124409600,3,475,4.3522727272727275
2008015,5,B0001KCI5E,"Set in London, Two's Company is a thoroughly enjoyable mid-70's britcom about a loud, abrasive, bossy, opinionated but very shrewd and quick-witted American mystery writer named Dorothy McNab who hires a snooty, pompous and equally opinionated, shrewd, and quick-witted butler named Robert.  Robert's air of superiority and his disdain of Americans are almost more than Dorothy can bear at times--indeed such insubordination would result in most servants getting the sack.  Robert, however, is an extremely capable butler; what's more, he is very possibly the best cook in London--and he knows it.

With two such strong--not to mention intelligent--personalities sharing one house, the stage is set for some terrific battles as each tries to outfox the other.  This isn't a show that relies heavily on visual humour--so one ought not to expect to find many pratfalls.  Rather, this is a show which is satisfyingly witty with lots of delicious verbal sparring.

This disc consists of six 25-minute episodes which comprise the complete first series.  At the time of writing, there are three series available, with series two and three each consisting of eight 25-minute episodes.  All three series are equally superb, and I suggest giving series one a try; if you enjoy it, then go ahead and get the rest of the series, as you'll enjoy them just as much.

In short, there's nothing off-colour or offensive here, and personally, this is a series that has quickly become one of our family's favourites--one which we're already in the process of rewatching!  It is one of the more intelligent britcoms, and it is one which I would certainly recommend to anyone who enjoys the better-known classic britcoms and is looking for something ""new"".",1123027200,5,1736,5.145907473309609
2008016,5,B0001KCI5E,I agree with the previous reviewer saying that this is one of the all time great British Sitcoms.  Classic British actor Donald Sinden is superb as the sardonic butler Robert and is a perfect foil for Elain Stritch.  A & E aired this series in the late 80s and I taped a handful of episodes.  After the run finished it was not broadcast since.  I was thrilled when I saw it listed as being out on DVD.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!,1089676800,8,423,4.30379746835443
8013529,5,B0001KCI5E,"Elaine Stritch was a treasure.  She is so funny and entertaining here.  I had to replace Series 1 in my ""boxed set"" as someone borrowed it.  We watch the whole series every couple of years - always enjoyable.  What with the dreck that is on TV these days, one needs some of these things to fall back on!",1521417600,,303,4.172413793103448
8013530,5,B0001KCI5E,One of my favorite British Comedies. Taped it years ago on VHS. Replaced the worn out tapes with dvd. Still funny after years of watching. Added bonus of Penelope Keith in one episode.,1516579200,,184,4.606060606060606
8013531,5,B0001KCI5E,"I bought this series primarily for one of my favorite actresses, Elaine Stritch. I would watch her in anything, she was one top talent and I followed her career over the years. The other bonus was her adversary, Sir Donald Sinden, one of my favorite British leading men. Sir Donald and I were both born in Plymouth England and I first became aware of him in The Cruel Sea, one of the greatest of all WW2 films. Their chemistry here was electric, total opposites, and they were an unbeatable team. I was glad to see the entire series on DVD and plan to buy the entire set. Nothing can top British comedy and this series was one of the best.",1503446400,,639,4.333333333333333

8013536,5,B0001KCI5E,After Elaine Stritch died I went online to find her performances and came upon this comedy series from London filmed during the 70s. I loved the gentle humor of that decade and Stritch did not disappoint. What a star!,1408492800,,217,4.589743589743589

8013538,4,B0001KCI5E,"My wife and I watched this show decades ago, on a cable channel that spent a couple of years broadcasting good British material.  I think that we saw about two ""series"" of this show.
We were so glad to find the discs.  And now, our friends are glad that we've introduced them to the show.

We also hope that you can get ""Two's Company - Complete Series 2""",1374969600,,355,4.1911764705882355
