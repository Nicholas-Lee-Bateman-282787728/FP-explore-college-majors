8617655,3,B00FPMW1Y6,"Well, it's silly fluff in baby colours, and still I smiled quite a lot.

And that's even though the Star production house seems to churn outs its romcoms, directed by female directors, with unchanging principles, including a) the exclusion of any reality or every day life b) a tearful family consolation c) lots of office scenes d) some bland pop music e) a wealthy family and a middleclass family f) very young, almost teenage, business heads without a trace of any kind of character. At least that's also the formula for Star's movies with John Lloyd Cruz and Sarah Geronimo, which I found a tad better overall than BHKCNCM.

As a specialty, Bakit Hindi... produces quite some four-letter-words (in the English subtitles at least). To make good for that, the last ten minutes are unbearably cheesy - no romcom should be allowed to go that far. But then, there's this movie's scriptwriter and self-help guru Ramon Bautista reappearing as a wisecracking taxi-driver, talking straight to the camera and getting more painful with every appearance.

The persons never feel real. Especially Xian Lim, the male lead, talks as if he was deciphering a script in a badly lit room - and that to his real-life girlfriend who is the leading lady in this film. She, Kim Chium, changes her character and attitude every five minutes; you never know what kind of person she is. A grandfather is called Chief.

I could go on, and still it's true that I watched the whole thing and had my fun. My favourite scene is perhaps an SMS ping-pong where the female lead and her cute gay brother get extremely excited about texting banalities to the lady's newfound (assumed) boyfriend.

My Star DVD had a few mildly interesting extras.",1397692800,,1712,4.809523809523809
