5668085,4,B00BR0SF8G,"I knew of Fran before this documentary.  I, like many others read Metropolitan Life, watched interviews with her and noticed photos of her while at various social/industry gatherings in New York through the years. It's all the same Fran - what you see is what you get, not one to mince words, no apologies and all the while insightful, provocative and witty. I doubt if anyone reading or listening to her comes away unaffected.

The documentary was filmed primarly at a restaurant table and is interspersed with film clips of her interview with Charlie Rose, etc. The time flew by as I watched and listened to every word, including the Extras.

I'm so glad Martin Scorsese thought Fran was documentary-worthy. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will again.

5668086,5,B00BR0SF8G,"This is a gem of a movie.  Fran Lebowitz will knock off your socks.  She is brilliant and you get to experience the world through her eyes.
I rarely buy movies, but after seeing this in the theater I knew it's one I needed to own!",1308441600,2,230,3.9782608695652173
5668087,5,B00BR0SF8G,"What an insightful, smart,and funny lady! I have seen it four times and each time I catch something different. I have read her books and articles but never heard her speak - I was not disappointed. A totally enjoyable film!",1307577600,5,223,4.6

5668089,5,B00BR0SF8G,When is she releasing her next DVD? I am begging her on bended knee to have her make me laugh hysterically once again. She is the Mark Twain of this Century. There will never be another for at least 100 years.,1390694400,4,209,4.121951219512195

5668091,3,B00BR0SF8G,"This is not a self help video on public speaking but mostly a yakity yaks of
fran lebowitz being interviewed giving her personal opinions on a lot of
topics from politics to religion and all those sorts of things.  the title of this dvd is a misnomer.",1374969600,3,251,4.340425531914893
5668092,5,B00BR0SF8G,"I love this picture. If you can relate to an honest, not always pretty picture. You can enjoy and laugh along, because Fran has
the wonderful ability to laugh at herself. I bought this to watch again and again.",1374537600,2,210,4.410256410256411
5668093,5,B00BR0SF8G,"I watched this great interview of Fran Lebowitz when it originally aired on HBO. Ever since then, I had been impatiently awaiting its arrival on DVD.

While I knew a lot about Scorsese going into it, I knew nothing about Fran. Personally, I think it made the experience that much more engaging. The interview is conducted in such a way that you feel like you are getting to know a new friend. Likewise, it doesn't hurt that Fran is a master conversationalists who handles the questions with ""elan"". ;)

A few side notes: The extras are interesting, but as a whole I was left wanting more (this is to the film's credit, as I never wanted it to end). Also, Scorsese directs the interview, and subsequent film, while sitting in on said interview, but he is NOT the one asking the questions. Bear this in mind.

All in all, highly recommended for the discerning viewer.",1373328000,,865,4.567741935483871
5668094,5,B00BR0SF8G,"Liebowitz is funny and wise, what more can
you want.  This film is quintessential New York,
core Manhattan.  Five stars.",1372464000,,120,4.95
5668095,5,B00BR0SF8G,If you like Fran Lebowicz you are going to like this documentary.  The fact the it was directed by Martin Scorsese doesn't hurt either.  The film has a good pace and a broad perspective.  Very interesting.,1365033600,,205,4.638888888888889
5668096,5,B00BR0SF8G,"Clever, witty and fun.  Scorsese does a great job of presenting Fran Lebowitz's unique view on the world.

There is something very refreshing about watching someone say what she really thinks as she views the very crazy world around her.

In our times, wit is a lost art form.  So glad that there are at least some people who know what wit is and how to use it.",1356825600,,361,4.264705882352941
5668097,5,B00BR0SF8G,"This is a highly entertaining documentary that does great credit to its two protagonists.  No doubt it has to be Fran Liebowitz who takes the prize, but that is in no small measure thanks to Martin Scorsese who has managed to present his subject in a most natural environment, where you feel as though you are present in the proceedings, and the director (although you see the back of his head) seems invisible.
Such is the extraordinary force of her personality and humour, that there is never a dull moment.  That in fact is quite some compliment since I have never actually heard of Fran Liebowitz before (unfortunately). I shan't attempt to describe the contents of this extended interview, since those who already know Fran Liebowitz need no introduction, and those who don't - well you don't know what you're missing (unless you don't happen to like the New York ""take"" on life).
I thank Mr. Scorsese for helping me make up for lost time, and if ever he should think of a sequel, count me in!",1333497600,5,998,4.632768361581921
5668098,5,B00BR0SF8G,"Absolutely brilliant.  I have watched this documentary 3 times and always find something new to astound, enlighten, give me pause for thought and, how wonderful, laugh out loud!",1328572800,,177,5.321428571428571
8572962,5,B00BR0SF8G,"Every so often a genius is born into an unlikely nest. In Fran's case, she's a surprise to her furniture selling family in Morristown NJ; and also a surprise to our time.

Oscar Wilde must have established an errant, illegitimate strain outside his neighborhood.",1516838400,,262,4.954545454545454
8572963,5,B00BR0SF8G,"The one, the only, the original.  Would love to meet her.",1504828800,,57,4.181818181818182
8572964,2,B00BR0SF8G,Not for the faint of heart. Will read reviews much closer next time. I love humor but this is beyond what I'm comfortable using in a classroom.,1498694400,,143,4.333333333333333
8572965,5,B00BR0SF8G,"Lebowitz is a national treasure. She has the kind of intelligence and wit that leads commentators to refer to her as a ""throwback"" to an earlier generation (1840s, 1880's, 1920s, 1940s?) when literary wit was cultivated and heralded. I love the reviews here by incensed folks who thought they could substitute 5 to 10 years of participation in public speaking programs by Toastmasters International with a DVD documentary on a cultural commentary icon. Seriously. So, Fran, if you want to up your rating, please ask Martin to update the progam by adding more guidance for dry mouth and techniques to cover when drawing a blank.

I've watched the DVD three times and shared it around with friends, so it's a gem I'll come back to often.",1496966400,2,735,4.833333333333333

8572968,5,B00BR0SF8G,"This was great!  Fran is at her best, witty, funny, intelligent, and very perceptive.

I had forgotten about her for a long time, after seeing her on Letterman back in the early 80's.  I developed quite a crush on her at the time, after seeing her walk on stage, totally hot in 501's and loafers, with beautiful blue eyes and wonderfully thick hair.  Yes, she's changed some, but still the same great wit.

Wish she had contact info, or even a social site (yes, she has a Facebook page, but it's created by her publisher).",1427587200,,522,4.4526315789473685
8572969,4,B00BR0SF8G,"Not only do I count myself a Fran Leibowitz fan but I bought this movie hungry for her particular brand of acerbic insightful wit. There are certainly some sharp bon mot layered in to some depth between short bits about her friends, her life in New York, but ultimately I felt the woman had been softened and polished more than was necessary. For a friend Leibowitz fan this is an opportunity to meet the woman in a more conversational mode. The aspects of Fran the deliberate sharp minded wit and her explanations of her life and influences are balanced but I don't feel I know Miss Leibowitz that much better or have had the chance to enjoy the best of her mind.

The advantage of reading the work of Miss Leibowitz either as collected in her more famous books or in her occasional essays with Vanity Fair is that you meet her focused on a topic and exhausting what she has to say about that topic. In the movie you get a variety of high points, bits of narrative and some very interesting video moments of some of the people who help illustrate points she is making. It is not immediately clear, for example why James Baldwin in debate with Bill Buckley Junior is part of this movie but it does not take much to align their brilliantly worded debate points with the kind of New York experience Miss Leibowitz is describing. There are several efforts to distinguish wit defined as being sharp edge and judge mental as opposed to humor which is defined as friendly. While this point is fairly well made the discussion relating jazz rhythms and successful joke telling is abandoned as an incomplete thought.

Fran Leibowitz fans are logical audience for this documentary. Speaking as one I conclude that it is almost all that I would want from this kind of documentary. For a person using this documentary as an introduction to Miss Leibowitz there is some good background but I'm not sure this conversation works as an introduction. It is a very friendly documentary and Scorsese is adept at varying the visuals to maintain interest I wish he had been so free with the editing.",1425859200,3,2078,4.613513513513514
8572970,5,B00BR0SF8G,This crazyass New Yorker saves my life every time I listen to her.,1408147200,,66,4.153846153846154
8572971,5,B00BR0SF8G,"I'm not complaining. I love this documentary. I just love how only opinion matters and that she states her opinions as facts. There's non of this ""I feel.... ""or ""I think...."" I have seen Public Speaking a few times and I saw some of it again On Demand last night. She is one funny person. My favorite part is when she talks about a bidding war to buy books she has not even written yet. For someone who just seems to talk and write for a living, she is very interesting.",1392422400,,471,4.186813186813187
