I was pleasantly surprised by the film. As other reviewers have said, it is indeed a bit dated looking. But in fact, the commentary and story are timeless. Furthermore, Poulin actually succeeds in creating tale of self-discovery that is far less reductionistic, orientalist, and ego-centric than the majority of ""India - spiritual travel""-style documentaries produced even today. I usually get frustrated when Mr. WASP comes along and trivializes or orientalizes the indigenous religious practice of so-called ""mystic India;"" this film, however, did not give touch that nerve.

Instead, Poulin presents a surprisingly honest and vulnerable exploration of one man's version of the journey.",1458259200,,699,5.647619047619048
8103055,4,B000DZQIUS,"Sadhana describes a man's journey into India and onto the mystical path. Along the way, Marcel Poulin, encounters holy men and many of the holy places of India. You will be introduced to Bhairav Muni, Swami Shyam, Bede Griffiths and Swami Premananda. Although dated-viewers will appreciate the portrayal of Hinduism and the suggestion that true religion takes one back to the Source of All. Some wonderful commentary by Fr. Bede Griffiths.",1439164800,,439,5.197183098591549
