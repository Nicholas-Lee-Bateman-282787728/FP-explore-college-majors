EUROPE!
I ALSO LIKED THE EXPEDIENCE OF DELIVERY AND THE SAFE PACKAGE!
AN EXCELLENT TRANSACTION!",1266883200,2,176,4.53125
7894770,5,6305807574,"It's very apparent that this film was made in the '60's, based upon the attitude of the main character that sex = love, and his selfish attitude toward relationships with women. Brigitte Bardot is stunningly beautiful, and entraps this guy with her guiles. In the guise of dictating to her his exploits and affairs with other women, Bardot actually turns the table on this creep, and is clearly the aggressor in the relationship. Bardot is more than just a pretty face, and carries this film with her talent. At the peak of her beauty, she can also act, as well as develop her character. Highly recommend this one!",1020556800,32,614,4.694444444444445
7894771,4,6305807574,"While the chauvinists can't get past her face, there is much more to Bardot.
In this film she displays great wit, charm and timing. And Trintignant is excellent as the amoral guy that goes through women quicker than a flu victim through a bag of Kleenex.
The flashbacks are great. The irony just flows.
Well worth a look.",981417600,15,321,4.551724137931035
