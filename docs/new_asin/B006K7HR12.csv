5000566,4,B006K7HR12,"I haven't got the item yet cause i live overseas. And i've only seen Sirocco and Knock On Any Door before (both of them are ok to good movies); but if you're a Bogart fan, like myself, buying this five titles separately will cost aroung 180$, so for 50$, this collections of Bogart with Columbia is more than good.
When i get the package i'll write a more complete review.",1421280000,,372,4.328571428571428
5000567,5,B006K7HR12,"This is a great Bogart collection from his days with Columbia. These five films are pretty good and range from one of his first to his last film ever made. TCM and SONY did a pretty good job on selecting the films to be put on this set. As done with their other Vault collections this set provides us with lots of extras and each movie includes a special introduction by Ben Mankiewicz which makes you feel like your watching the movie on TCM Channel. The only problem is the digi case they provide which can be a hassle to take out a disk.

As for the movies included, they are as follows:
""Love Affair"" (1932/67mins/b&w/Full frame)
-Bogart, Dorothy Mackall; Directed by Thornton Freeland
""Knock on Any Door"" (1949/99mins/b&w/Full frame)
-Bogart, John Derek, George MacReady, Allene Roberts, Susan Perry; Directed by Nicholas Ray
""Tokyo Joe"" (1949/88mins/b&w/Full frame)
-Bogart, Alexander Knox, Florence Marly, Sessue Hayakawa; Directed by Stuart Heisler
""Sirocco"" (1951/98mins/b&w/Full frame)
-Bogart, Lee J. Cobb, Everett Sloan, Gerald Mohr, Zero Mostel; Directed by Curtis Bernhardt
""The Harder They Fall"" (1956/108mins/b&w/Widescreen)
-Bogart, Rod Steiger, Jan Sterling, Mike Lane, Max Baker; Directed by Mark Robson

Overall the quality of the movies are really good and this is a collection I would recommend.",1374105600,12,1317,5.266666666666667

5000570,4,B006K7HR12,"This collection is filled with Bogart's movies made through Santana productions released by columbia through harry cohn. As a youth Bogart was always my favourite of the old actors(along with cagney and robinson)and the old wb stalwarts developed a worldwide interest,with Bogart the most. As history wb was upset he choose to release his movies through columbia,but columbia had done solo projects with him over the years  and was always ready to entice him. His big break was Casablanca,although he made many strong performances like high sierra and maltese falcon before that,but let's begin with the first film

love affair(193?)is rarely seen,I saw it here for the first time,and actually the female lead is the star and he mostly supports her and deals with the ins and outs of aviation,and he never made much of a splash in early hollywood and it wasn't until the stage success of the petrified forest(1935)that he was invited back.
Knock on any door(1949)was the first film made. Nicholas Ray who was new to hollywood was one of bogart's favorite people in hollywood. If we look at these films they deal with the smearing and ruin of innocent people,and how they interact within layers of society doing damage to communities,with only persons of conscience to protect them. This may seem sociologically reducing as the
introducer to the film says,but that's for others to judge the reality of our modern cities. The film begins with the shooting of a policeman by the john derek character(marlon brando was not used due to cost). The lawyer of
conscience,the bogart character who protected his father,who died of heart trouble in jail,believes he's innocent. However,the derek character is victimized by 'society' in all ways,lies in court,chased away from jobs,his
girlfriend and love object and support forced to commit suicide and its this
suicide of his love interest at the end which forces him to shoot the policeman and we can just guess at what the connection is. The way innocent people were treated and the real causes of crime ignored nor the proper pursuit of crime the moral of the story,and a sthe lawyer bogart sais at the end knock on any door and you will find a nick romano,like the problems of the city were spreading,and problems not adequately assessed.

The next project Tokyo joe has him playing a bar owner of sorts returning to
japan in a casablanca type character and surprised to find his love interest still alive. Of course the love he felt is the reason for his return. He finds she is accused of being a traitor,and is involved in smuggling to keep his girlfriend from being prosecuted. There is subplot here about being accused of
communist,and smuggling across hong kong macao,and at films end he dies saving the life of lover's child. The point about film is he's really an innocent
person although the film is not a very good one,but it does show how the
attachment to a woman can lead someone astray. An early interesting look also
at how people in this area were often viewed suspicously,and had fixed days
permits.

The next film sirocco(1951) deals with the french trying to broker peace in syria and their presence in the region. It also is really a lesson in how these land engagements always lead to failures and  backfire. Also how the military leaders girlfriend is interfered with by the bogart character,harry smith,and his attachment to local girl and how it interferes with his military judgement,and later Smith confronts him with this as the real reason for his wanting to murder him. It is really a fim of military control,gun runners,how
military intrusion in any region will fail,and also bad intelligence.as the
bogart character tries to get himself out of damascus but ends up being killed.
The early part of the film,where the female character tries to escape from
the grips of the military chieftain by the fugitive smith,is a turn on the idea
of the innocent and the hunted,but they fail,with much insight on syria,a land
of foreign intrusion for 2000 years. The least successful of the bogart productions.

The harder they fall(1956) was not a film made by bogart's company but by columbia. The last film before he died. It deals with a sportswriter taking a job promoting a south american boxer through a series of fixed fights. It really shows how boxing matches were staged,and how the world of sports was corrupted,and at the end the journalist changes,is reformed and though the
boxer beaten and bloodied gets nothing he turns over all his money to him,and
it just goes to show as all these movies do,how the innocent have no help in society. How these people are victimized in these movies are what the artist
bogart wanted to portray and we tank him for trying to illustrate through a
series of films,that usually conscience driven people in communities are the
only people who really try to help him, of course these films are said to be dated,and its for the viewer to judge.

In a lonely place is probably the best of the bogart produced films made and is not part of this collection,and is also about innocence and botched investigations,and how and why they become botched,but also with a subplot involving hollywood and had a cult following for a time and is onre of the actor's and director ray's best films.",1333065600,3,5289,4.856984478935699
5000571,5,B006K7HR12,"Now that Amazon handles this Humphrey Bogart film package, the hope is that  packaging improvements have been made.  It is incomprehensible that the Sony Corporation would take the trouble to digitize and transfer these wonderful films, then distribute them in such awful packaging.  Four of the discs were seated in slots that guarantee the discs will rub against each other and cause scuffing and scratches that can, and in my case, did result in impairments causing one of the discs to stop working.  Sony should copy the Alec Guinness film package - another set of 5 films where each disk rests snugly on its own spindle and the discs are protected from scratching and mutilation.  Surely Humphrey Bogart is the equal of Alec Guinness, and his films deserve the best preservation, only an idiot would argue otherwise..

Love Affair
This film opens with Lady Columbia dressed in her art decco robes and while the effect is  stunning, on the whole, this 1932 effort for Columbia Pictures received short shrift from film critics of the day.  Alistare Cooke's reaction, taken from his book Six Men, was typical: ""As a film critic long ago, I had been vaguely aware of Bogart in his earliest appearances as an uncomfortable leading man in such forgettable items as A Devil With Women, and Love Affair.""  The film survives as a historical curiosity, as a window into the early days of sound pictures, and of course, as a vehicle for Humphrey Bogart fans.

Even your host for this series, Ben Mankiewicz, apologizes for Love Affair, acknowledging the movie isn't one of Bogart's best.  But I think Mankiewicz has it wrong here.  Looking backward, our hindsight is perfect.  We know what the producers didn't know in 1932: that Humphrey Bogart was a great actor.  The value of a film like Love Affair is to see how he got there.  Flashes of his later form surface in this film - not in the beginning of the picture - Bogart smirks too much in a self deprecating way.  But by the end of the film the smirk is gone and he knows who his character is.  Then too, you need a sympathetic camera, someone at the lens who understands character and what drives it.  Bogart didn't have that yet.  There is a moment near the end of the movie where Bogart's character decides he has to break up his sister's impending marriage.  It's an important instant that moves the actor to action but the camera breaks away, refusing to linger, running off to other business even though Bogart's face tightens in decision.  That's what makes this film so tantalizing.  If this, that, the other thing had been done, it might have turned out better.  At one point, as Bogart flounders his way through a marriage proposal, he apologizes for his romantic ineptness with words that might also indicate his feeling for the role: ""I know I'm doing this all wrong.  It's because I'm new at it.""

On a technical note, Love Affair is the only film in the package with its own spindle that holds the CD snugly in the manner we've become accustomed to.  The remaining four discs are ganged on top of each other in slots; a packaging method that almost guarantees scratches and defects as we shall see later on.

Knock On Any Door
Humphrey Bogart and his friend, producer Robert Lord, created an independent production company, Santana Productions, in the aftermath of a 1948 Supreme Court decision requiring motion picture studios to end their practice of owning movie theaters.  The Court ruled owning the means of production from top to bottom was ""vertical integration"", the studios would have to cut the theaters loose.  The studio system was ending and for the first time, top actors like Bogart had a voice in how they worked.  Knock On Any Door, the maiden voyage for Santana Productions, was directed by up and coming director Nicholas Ray.  The Ray-Bogart collaboration continued in the 1950 production In A Lonely Place.

The film has a fatalistic theme that turns people into victims, unable to escape their circumstances or alter the hand fate has dealt them.  That message didn't sit well with post war audiences or critics who were just emerging from the twin scourges of The Great Depression and World War II, and it directly contradicted the ethos of personal responsibility.  The message didn't sit well with Bogart either, at one point in the film he administers tough love to badboy Nick Romano (John Derek), blackjacking him in a back alley while delivering a sharply worded wakeup call.  Director Ray however, stayed with the theme of adolescent maladjustment, developing it even more fully in his later masterpiece, Rebel Without A Cause.  Knock On Any Door did not provide Santana Productions with the financial cushion Bogart and Lord had hoped for.

Ganging CD discs in slots instead of having each disc rest on its own spindle reaps its reward with Knock On Any Door.  The slot based packaging created scuff marks and  deformities on the disc that brought the film to a complete halt several times, although after two or three minutes, the film restarted on its own.  I can't and won't hold Bogart or Ray responsible for the packaging mistakes of the suits who distribute their material, but I can forewarn consumers that cheap packaging damaged the physical properties of this disc.

Sirocco
Santana Pictures gave Bogart artistic freedom, but like any owner, he acquired business worries.  In the brilliant Humphrey Bogart biography Tough Without A Gun, author Stefan Kanfer cites Bogart's comments to New Yorker writer Lillian Ross made during preparations for Sirocco.  ""I've been doing the role for years.  I've worn that trench coat in half the pictures I've been in.  What I don't like is business worries.  I'm bowed down with business worries....Santana has eleven writers on Sirocco, and none of them goons has come up with an ending yet.""  Bogart characterized the film as ""one we had to do.  It stank, of course.""

But Bogart is not the best critic of his films.  Beat The Devil, his 1953 film, is an acclaimed masterpiece of camp if not the first instance of the genre.  Beat the Devil cost Bogart $400,000 personally and returned nothing.  At the time of its making, Sirocco also fared poorly in critical circles.  Like Beat The Devil, it did not find an immediate audience, because the real time for Sirocco's audience is now.  Because of the way history cycles back on itself, there simply is no better dramatization of the events now taking place in Syria than the Santana Productions film Sirocco.  The inherent bad faith of government is the real subject of the film, just as it is the subject of current events in Damascus today.  Critics in 1951 had blinders on when they harped incessantly about Casablanca.  Sirocco stands on its own merits, and also has its own share of memorable one liners like ""When you're broke, you're alive in a new way.""  Burnett Guffey (Bonnie and Clyde) delivers gorgeous cinematography that is quintessentially noirish.  What keeps Sirocco from reaching the heights achieved by Casablanca is the score.  It doesn't aspire...it doesn't inspire.  With a score for the ages, who knows what might have been?

Tokyo Joe
Blood On The Sun starring James Cagney began a series of films that looked at the underside of Japanese social mores.  Tokyo Joe follows it up - much later came The Yakuza, with Robert Mitchum, and still later, Ridley Scott's Black Rain with Michael Douglas.  All of these films have story lines that take us back to World War II, but unlike Tokyo Joe, the later movies are filmed at least partially in Japan, and thus have a landscape with an authentic look and feel. Under no circumstances was Bogart going to Japan, although Santana Pictures deployed a second film crew to take aerial footage of the Japanese city.  When it came to the star, a body double was filmed in a trench coat then spliced into the picture during the editing process.  The results are passable because once again, Bogart is drawn into an underworld consortium ferrying contraband that eventually includes  human cargo.  The characterizations by the entire cast stand out in this picture even as the plot dissolves into melodrama.  The film transfer didn't go as smoothly as one would expect in the digital age, there are a few spots where it appears the film splices did not match up perfectly, but those are few and far between.  Overall, it's a very watchable film, held together by Charles Lawton Jr.'s vivid cinematography and Bogart's ability to rivet our attention.

The Harder They Fall
From the opening notes of Hugo Friedhoffer's music, it's clear Bogart finally gets what he had in Casablanca: a great score.  It's appropriately taut and severe, shifting to a carnival like accompaniment worthy of a Fellini picture.  The sound of aircraft whooshing during the fight scenes is bone tingling.  Burnett Guffey is at the camera again, insuring that framing and composition is lean and angular.

This picture fulfilled a contract obligation for Bogart, and was scheduled as a prelude to re-unification with Lauren Bacall in a screen project called Underworld USA.  Bogart had sold Santana Productions to Columbia Pictures for a cool million, and in the Spring of 1956, formed a new venture, Mapleton Pictures.  Underworld would be its maiden voyage.

The off screen story for The Harder They Fall is as interesting as the film.  Allan Frank, in his 1982 book ""Humphrey Bogart"",  has Bogart besting Steiger.  ""As for Steiger, he went down for the count time after time in their scenes together"".  Steiger apparently talked to himself on the set, causing Bogart to miss his cues, and  Bogie gave producer Philip Yordan an earful. ""This scratch your ass and mumble school of acting doesn't please me.  You have to do something."".  Film scholar David Thomson claims Steiger retaliated, deliberately outacting Bogart in crucial scenes. It's the silliest kind of argument - Steiger's fighter is ""a creampuff with a glass jaw"". He has to sell, and sell hard to stay in character.  When the camera rolls, the mumbling is gone and the words  fly out of his mouth.  Rod Steiger and Nehemiah Persoff came to the picture from On The Waterfront, making them part of a select group of actors to have worked with both Marlon Brando and Humphrey Bogart.

Bogart thought critics would pummel The Harder They Fall, but 1956 was a strange kind of year.  Jackie Robinson retired from baseball; Frank Robinson stepped in to fill the void.  It happened in film, too.  Bogart finished The Harder They Fall, and Paul Newman made Someone Up There Likes Me shortly afterwards.  Bosley Crothers for the New York Times made the connection.  He called The Harder They Fall ""a lively, stinging film"" even if it had a hokey ending imposed  by Hollywood moguls.  ""The other side of the coin from The Harder They Fall, which pictured professional boxing as sordid and corrupt, is being touchingly presented by MGM's Somebody Up There Likes Me.""

The Underworld project never materialized, Bogart took ill in the Spring of 1956 after The Harder They Fall was released.  He had an operation for throat cancer, and the famous gravely voice was gone.  In his 1980 memoir An Open Book, director John Huston who directed Bogart in The Maltese Falcon and Beat The Devil, describes his final visits with Bogie: ""When he was no longer able to walk, his emaciated body would be lifted into a wheelchair and pushed to a dumb waiter on the second floor landing.  His nurses would help him in and he would be lowered down to the kitchen, where another transfer would be made, and he'd be transported through the house into the library and his chair.  And there he would be, sherry glass in one hand, cigarette in the other, at 5:30 when guests started to arrive.  They were limited now to those who had known him best and longest, and they stayed, two and three at a time, for half an hour or so until about 8 o'clock which was the time for him to go back up stairs.  No one who sat in his presence those final weeks will ever forget.  It was a unique display of sheer animal courage.  After that first visit, one quickened to the grandeur of it, expanded and felt strangely elated, proud to be there, proud to be his friend, the friend of such a brave man.""",1330560000,24,12247,4.79618138424821
