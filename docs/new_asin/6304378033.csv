857531,5,6304378033,"I saw this a few years back at the Fant-Asia film festival in Calgary and I was just stunned.  From what I've heard, they just don't make slasher/horror films that often in Asia, so when they set out to shock and horrify, they go to the extreme, in true Asian style.  This story concerns a serial killer posing as a restaurant prorietor who goes into violent rages and indulges in sadistic acts.  For those of you used to Anime and other far-out Asian arts, you may be already jaded and unaffected, but for those of you looking for something to disturb you, seek this out.  it's not an atypical story by any means, but the murder scenes are pretty grisly.  One guy gets chopped up into dim sum. In another sequence, a family gets hacked to pieces...you ever notice in Hollywood where murdered children get killed offscreen?  Not here. there's also a graphic rape scene involving chopsticks that ain't exactly feminist-friendly.  Needless to say, with every succesive murder during the screening. more and more people walked out.  It's rare you see a horror film provoking anything more than laughter nowadays.  This one is all out, gung-ho savagery.  What's even weirder is the moments of slapstick that pop-up whenever the cops are in a scene.  A strange way to lighten the darker scenes, but, that's Asian cinema for you...unpredictable, daring, extreme and the polar opposite of Western filmmaking.  The guy who plays the killer won some prestigious awards in awards for his portrayal, and he deserves them.  very creepy and convincing.  Go to your local Chinese videostore and try and get this gem and play it at your next sleepover party.",997574400,,1643,4.821428571428571
857532,5,6304378033,"In August 1985 a mutilated body is found on the beach in Macau. The man is thought to be an illegal Chinese emigrant, and Inspector Lee and his team soon discover the stranger's death shows clear signs of foul play. The investigation focuses on a little restaurant in town and its new proprietor Mr. Wong. He swears to know nothing about the disappearance of the former owner and family, and explains that he acquired the restaurant legally when they decided to emigrate abroad. However, further research reveals that the family never left Chinese territory. Wong is arrested and subjected to an interrogation so violent that he eventually cracks. The atrociousness of the crime is finally within an inch of being brought to light.",991353600,,731,4.951219512195122
857533,1,6304378033,"Although Anthony Wong gives a memorably chilling performance as a brutal killer, this ultra-gory Hong Kong film is as ungainly aesthetically as its literal Chinese title (""Eight Immortals Restaurant's Human Flesh Roast Pork Bun"").  It is shocking only on a superficial level, and lacks the slightest profundity on anything; it leaves you wondering, ""What's the point and why should I care?""  Wong is presented simply as a generic psychotic, who regularly kills the people who catch him cheating in Mahjong games.  We have no inkling of his personal life, his thoughts, his world views.  The film's depiction of his demented psyche is about as masterful as showing him drinking his own urine and chewing off the veins under his wrist.  The film's emphasis is on the excruciating details of his murderous itinerary, which, I suppose, director Herman Yau captures with great technical competence in terms of realism and horror.  I'm a jaded, blase movie viewer, and still, the violence of this film is genuinely unnerving to me.  The plot is an incoherent combination of Wong's exploits, an awkwardly comical subplot about inept and sexist cops, a melodramatic concoction about how the police sics a vengeful prisoner on Wong.  See the film if you want to get an idea on the astounding level of violence and gore a Hong Kong can reach.
This Tai Seng DVD contains 2 commentary tracks (from Yau and Wong).  Comments are spoken sparingly; long intervals of silence are frequent.  Their comments brought up the interesting point that the killer ironically becomes a victim later in the film.  The DVD contains Cantonese and Mandarin soundtracks and optional yellow English subtitles (which include a few Portugese swear words as spoken in the film).  All the trailers have permanent, hard-to-read subtitles, however.  The picture quality is passable, perhaps due to the low-budgetness of the film; but then again many Tai Seng DVDs I have seen have less than satisfactory picture quality.",989971200,5,1981,5.114906832298137
857534,5,6304378033,"This film is one of the most graphic and brilliantly powerful films I have ever seen. Anthony Wong turns in a blistering performance as the owner of a Macau restaurent where his employees go missing. And the ingredients of his  buns he makes there are rather unusual. The film's violence hits home so  hard because of the humour also evident in the film, particularly between a  group of cops on Wong's tail. You will need a strong stomach to watch one  scene in paticular towards the end, but it is worth it. Not many films are  as powerfully graphic and accomplished as this one. The DVD is also superb.  The picture and sound are good, and the extras are superb. Featuring a good  commentary from Anthony Wong and a Hong Kong film critic, and a commentary  from director Herman Yau. The animated menus are also excellant, presented  in the theme of a restaurent menu.",959904000,9,870,4.597402597402597
857535,5,6304378033,"I`ve seen a lot of gore & splatter-movies so far, but this one was one of the best ones ever. If you like watching films which don`t make any compromises in showing explicit murdering and  violence against men, women and children and if you like a pinch of black humour, you have to watch it  immediately. The Untold Story is the ultimate example of how  making a  Cat. III - film. If you want to see what`s the difference between american  or european horror/exploitation movies then order it now!
No moral  hypocrisies! No mercy! No remorse! (it`s only a movie, don`t forget about  that)
But do not forget that only the US-DVD is full uncut !",959040000,,644,4.5
857536,5,6304378033,"If you have never experienced the quaint world of Asian cinema, let me outline some of the plot devices for you--murder, rape, torture, dismemberment, cannibalism, murder as comedy, urine drinking, police  brutality, and child murder. I may have left a few things out. The Untold  Story contains all of the above, and is probably one of the most upsetting  films you'll ever watch. I say ""watch"" in a subjective sense,  because some of the scenes, especially a rape sequence and a flashback on  the murders of an entire family, are so hard to watch that you may turn  away.
The biggest high point of the film is the psycho, played by  Anthony Wong. Wong, a veteran of Hong Kong cinema who won prestigious  awards for his portrayal of a serial killer in this movie, is electricity  on the screen. He steals every scene he's in and comes across as one scary  individual. He makes it very hard for the viewer to have any sympathy for  him, even when the cops beat and torture him to get a confession. Another  high point is the soundtrack, which is ultra-cool and atmospheric.
Since  this film is Asian, you will probably get a few laughs out of the dub job,  but at least it spares the viewer the tedium of reading subtitles. I'd  recommend picking up the tape because you'll freak out your friends when  you show it to them. Your girlfriend probably won't be as impressed.",958176000,,1371,4.580246913580247
857537,3,6304378033,"Being a big fan of HK cinema and an even bigger fan of gore films, I highly anticipated watching the untold story. The box promises cannibalism in a humorous vein and comes with a standard warning of graphic violence,  so I figured it would probably be a lot of fun. The first scene has Anthony  Wong, the big time bad guy, setting fire to a man after a gambling dispute,  very realistic. Then, after some plot developement which more less  establishes Wong as being a despicable man, he kills again and chops up his  victim into pieces in a scene which is gut wrenching and very convincing.  So far, I think it's pretty cool. then the film suddenly slaps you with  this awful rape scene, certainly the most disturbing, graphic, and  frighteningly realistic of such depictions I have ever seen. I won't repeat  what all Wong does to this woman but I can assure you watching it is far  from what anyone should be considering enjoyable. After that we're treated  to about 40 minutes of moronic cops torturing Wong into confessing. These  scenes are not any fun either, they're drawn out and pointless and lead the  film nowhere. Eventually, after much police brutality and sleep deprivation  the film goes into a flashback where we see Wong slaughter 8 more people,  including 5 young children whose participation in the film must have been  traumatizing for them considering their age. This is another very gory  scene, and a rather long one,  but not quite as disturbing as the one I  mentioned earlier. Like I said, I was looking for a movie a little bit more  laughable in it's use of blood and guts, but this film is no laughing  matter! It's main purpose seems to be the intention of shocking and  upsetting the veiwer, and to it's credit it acheives these goals. Wong  received the Hong Kong film awards best actor for his role here and I guess  he deserved it considering all the awful things he did for this movie. A  true study in method acting but other than that he just sneers and screams  alot. The cops, as I said, are depicted as sexist and incompetant morons  who turn surprisingly cruel once they have their suspect in custody. HK  movies often depict cops as idiots for comic relief (see Dr. Lamb or Naked  Killer among others) but here it's just really out of place and unnecesary.  That's the main fault of the film, but mainly I want to warn others who  might consider renting or buying this movie in the hopes of getting some  laughs out of it- you won't. This is some hard core stuff. As a side note,  the extras and additional trailers are really neat, and the transfer looks  great.",944611200,23,2606,4.557235421166307
857538,5,6304378033,"Well, I had thought I had seen it all until I watched The Untold Story starring Anthony Wong.  Now I know why he is one of the top actors in H.K. as he played the ""Bunman"" to perfection.  Gruesome, gory and  stomach churning, this movie has it all.  Never seen anything like it and  probably never will.  Fans of horror or Asian movies will love it.",939081600,2,349,4.212121212121212
857711,3,6304378033,"If you've gone as far as to FIND this product on Amazon and search the user reviews, then you already know the film itself and how twistedly amazing it is. That being said, my reviews are not on the films themselves- that is pointless. The point is- is this a product you want to buy? It depends on a couple things. I'm assuming you've seen this film before; if you want to have the cleanest copy of The Untold Story out there, with extras, and with creative high-end menu art, you must then pay the extra money for the Tai-Seng version (which I also own and is truly awesome!). However, if you just really love the film and would like a hard copy of it that you can watch and show to your friends and you don't care about best quality (and don't mind if there aren't any extras), then this prouct is perfect for you. This is because the audio, video, and overall quality of this version are DEFINITELY/NOTICIBLY not as good as the other Region 1 version.

If you HAVE NOT seen this film, then I would recommend seeing it somehow in its best quality first before buying this release. The film deserves to be seen in its prime form. Nevertheless, after you've accomplished that, then buy this and watch it as many times as you want :)

Other details about the DVD: Region 0 (ALL REGIONS, PC COMPATABLE), Cantonese Audio w/ optional English Subtitles, full un-cut version of the film, subtitles are different translations than Tai-Seng's (which are yellow and easy to read) but are good enough.

857712,2,6304378033,"I bought this film based solely on customer reviews on amazon.com. My expectations were really high after reading the positive reviews. I was left feeling disappointed and conned after watching the film. This movie is certainly not a collector's item or a masterpiece. Can't believe I actually paid $37.8 for it.
Good points:
1) Convincing performance by main characters
2) Good picture and sound quality
3) Good flow

Negatives
1) High cost - with the benefit of hindsight, I won't pay more than $4 for this
2) Plot was very shallow
3) No `English language' in the audio options - hence I spent more time reading than actually watching the film",1297382400,,645,4.8108108108108105
857713,3,6304378033,"The Untold Story (Danny Lee and Herman Yau, 1993)

The Untold Story is one of those movies I'm not quite sure how to review. Looking back on it from sixteen years later, it's impossible to deny the incredible influence the movie has had on world cinema; it practically created a subgenre of its own. And yet when it comes right down to it, it's not all that good a movie. In fact, it's not at all a good movie; the acting is terrible, the script is worse, the direction is adequate at best, even the lighting is bad. And yet filmmakers, especially Asian filmmakers, have spent years trying to recapture the magic that made this an underground sensation, or applying their own take on the subject matter. And some of the films that have resulted (Cruel Restaurant, Dumplings, etc.) are truly wonderful. From that perspective, The Untold Story must be given all necessary props. But like a number of other foundation films (especially of this stripe), that doesn't mean you have to like the movie itself.

The plot: Chi-hang Wong (Infernal Affairs' Anthony Wong Chau-sang) is the new owner of a local dumpling shop. How he managed to come into possession of it is somewhat mysterious (and, in fact, the main plot of the movie is the police attempting to figure out what happened to the previous owner). He does quite a good business; there's just something about his barbecued pork dumplings that makes them miles better than what the clientele were used to previously. We know what it is, of course; as the old joke goes, that ain't pork. The cops are unaware (and in fact, the squad investigating him develops quite a taste for the dumplings in question), but they do think he offed the previous owner, and because of that, they hatch a plot to get him to confess by tossing him in a cell with the former owner's brother, Poon (Ebola Syndrome's Pui-on Shing). But oh, when he gets out, he's gonna be mad...

With a guy like Tony Wong in the lead role, you expect some serious acting chops, but the simple fact is that Wong is the only top dog in this picture, and he was still relatively early in his career at this point; by 1993, his only really big project had been Hard Boiled, where he had been a supporter to two much bigger stars, Yun-fat Chow and Tony Leung Chiu-wai. Granted, this isn't a huge production by any means, but Lee (a veteran exploitation director) and Yau (who would return three years later with the even crazier Ebola Syndrome) may have asked Wong to do a little more than he was capable of at this point. (Obviously, given his track record since, he used the experience well.) Still, he does the best he can with a script that truly never looked to be anything but a silly exploitation flick, the kind of thing one would expect from T. F. Mous or Godfrey Ho. Not surprising, given that Lee as as long and (un)distinguished a history in Asian exploitation as either of those guys. The difference is that where Mous' films have an unmistakable feel to them, and Ho's movies are always bad enough to be instantly recognizable, Lee's just feel like generic exploitation films. He's kind of the Fred Olen Ray of Asian directors. You can't go into The Untold Story expecting a classic, and if you're a fan of earlier Asian gore films (both the bulk of the Guinea Pig series and the first Men Behind the Sun film precede this) the violence in here probably isn't going to make you cringe, but if you're a gorehound, it's a movie you kind of have to see, in the same way you can't be a fan of vampire flicks without seeing Murnau's Nosferatu. ** ",1260403200,,3563,4.536547433903577
857714,5,6304378033,"Very disturbing matter here,from children being murdered(this scene really was hard to look at,I wonder how they handeled this with the child actors),a whole entire family being slaughtered to a girl killed by chopsticks penetrating her privates over and over. Anthony Wong is creepy as hell as the cook killer rapist cannibalist. The story is the cook kills the owner of a restaurant and takes over. The police ask questions about missing owner and his family,while the cook is trying to legally get ownership of the restaurant. His victims are cut up and their meat is used to make pork buns. He then serves them to the customers as well as the cops who stop by. These pork buns sure look tasty the way these people scarf them down. Just really evil stuff going on here. With all the depravity here there is some humour from the police detectives who are portrayed as goofballs. Their Captain likes to parade around his paid for dates he has by his side every time he makes an appearence. Some how these kooky cops make ""The Untold Story""just that more sicker. Stay away from viewing if you get disturbed easily,because this one will have you feeling ill. If your sort of a sicko when it comes to your horror then by all means,pick this up. I'm not sure how real this story really is,but it's good sick fun for the most hardcore fans of the genre.",1226880000,,1349,4.578512396694215
857715,4,6304378033,"Anthony Wong (who won Best Actor at the Hong Kong Film Awards for this brilliant performance) plays Wong Chi Hang, the new ""owner"" of the Eight Immortals Restaurant in Macau. Of course, the police believe he's only the new owner because he murdered the real owner and his entire family out of greed and bloodlust. They're right of course, and no, I'm not giving anything away. ""The Untold Story"" falls in line with what one might call the serial killer film subgenre. We know who is doing the killing and are mainly splitting time between the killer doing his crimes and covering them up, and the cops trying to catch him. Still, ""The Untold Story"" stands out from the many serial killer films out there, most notably because it is extremely brutal and graphic in depicting unspeakable acts on men, women, and children before the viewers' very eyes. While I am not as taken aback as other viewers for some reason, maybe 'cause my dad was a butcher, ha, a few scenes did get to me too and it is definitely more graphic than any U.S. films that come to mind. Some classic elements boost the film as well, like the old ""serving the victims to the customers"" bit (which audiences love for some reason, myself included) and the fact that this one is based on a true story. There's also the amazingly creepy performance by Anthony Wong. In addition to all that, you have something extra for American audiences. Filmmaking in Hong Kong is very different, and while many of us might be put off by their politically incorrect ways and willingness to throw lots of comedy in between the horror elements, the rest of us will find it really quite fascinating and entertaining to see a film so culturally different. The film also stars Danny Lee as head of a police force that spends most of its time goofing around and is the source of the comic relief. Emily Kwan is Bo, the female cop who stands out from the rest because she is constantly teased by her peers and has a crush on the boss. Herman Yau directed ""The Untold Story"", and he really does an amazing job of building up the suspense and keeping things moving, and the great music supports him. The DVD is excellent, presenting the film in widescreen with English subtitles, uncut, with two audio commentaries (one with Herman Yau and one with Anthony Wong), bios and filmographies on Yau, Wong, and Lee, and a handful of trailers that include the one for ""The Untold Story"".

857716,3,6304378033,"The Untold Story aka Bunman aka Human Pork Rolls is not for everyone, choosing to tell its story of Macao's answer to Sweeney Todd as a broad black comedy, an approach somewhat enhanced for UK viewers by the frightening similarity Anthony Wong's bug-eyed homicidal purveyor of human pork buns has to much-loved British comedian Eric Morecambe on a particularly bad day (it's the glasses). Co-director Danny Lee's cheerful cop doesn't help matters, constantly bringing beautiful hookers with him into the station or to crime scenes and provoking the envy of his cartoonish detectives investigating missing persons while they enjoy free samples from Wong's caf. All of which makes a graphic rape scene involving chopsticks all the more unpleasant, and in all the wrong ways. Did I mention it was a true story?",1209340800,,807,5.121212121212121
857717,3,6304378033,"Hong Kong films are generally more violent than American ones (believe it or not), but this one is so over the top and brutal that it's nearly impossible to sit through.  From the opening shot of Anthony Wong bashing the head of a ""friend"" of his repeatedly through a wall, to the final carnage in which you see Wong cutting up an entire family (they show EVERYTHING), the film is one of most visceral, sense assaulting films I've ever seen.  It's not the most artistic movie ever made, but you can't get some of the stuff out of your head, like when the waitress is killed or when Wong is nearly beaten to death by his fellow prisoners.  The best performance here is by Anthony Wong.  He's so creepy and scary here that he makes the film.  Danny Lee and the policemen here are very silly, almost childish, and borderline fascistic.  They seem to break every rule about due process of law to get Wong to confess.  Danny Lee plays the chief inspector, and for some reason, he enters nearly every scene with a bimbo on his arm.  And the rest of the police people act like horny teenagers, not mature, adult policemen.  I'm not really sure why that is.  The story is, as the credits say, ""based, unfortunately, on real events"", but there really isn't any mystery or intelligence in this film.  It doesn't feel like a cop film.  It's just a brutal, visceral assault of violence.  The violence here, though, is horrific.  It's sort of like a Lucio Fulci film (except this film is better), when you're waiting for the gore scenes.  The final scene where Wong cuts up the entire family is almost impossible to watch (even for this viewer).  If you're into that type of assault, go for it.

That idea is pretty disgusting, but for much of the movie I kind of felt a mental attachment to this crazy dude.  Somebody has got to root for the bad guy, right?  Plus, the police were severely beating him based on unsubstantiated evidence.  I thought for awhile that maybe this guy was semi-innocent.

The other part is about the detective's that are trying to catch him, until they finally meet up for the jaw-dropping finally. Which brings me to my one minor complaint; the scenes with the detectives' had comedic and cheesy elements to them that would have made the film much more serious and disturbing without. It doesn't ruin anything, but it would have been a much darker film without the cheesy comedy. This is also based on a true story which makes it even more offensive. While it's not as gory as a film like Cannibal Holocaust or Nekromantik, it pushes some boundries that nobody else dare's to touch. I don't want to spoil to much for potential viewers, but I will say this- NOTHING is off limits in this movie. Highly recommended.",1201132800,,1063,4.570680628272251

857783,4,6304378033,"A lot of people are praising ""The Untold Story"" while others feel it does not splatter the mark.  Those who like splatter movies will like this film.  It is loaded with gore and does have that touch of weird humor that splatter fans love.  It is also a sick twisted little puppy with the kind of twists and turn the stomach scenes that will make the faint-hearted barf.  Do not show it to your squeemish buddies while serving dimsum, or they will blow their cookies (and pork buns) all over your flat.  Hardcore gorehounds will simply find the thick blood action entertaining (watch out for the screaming kiddies scene).

 Though this story is supposedly based on fact, the mood is rather light and fluffy. The killer has a stretch face that looks like it will bust open at any time, and he does take a good bouncy rubbery punch (over and over again).  ""The Untold Story"" has a lot of revenge and rubbery punching (bounce, bounce).  The characters are very shallow.  The viewer never gets to really know anyone.  Thus this is a just a variation on the splatter flick, and if someone is looking for a splatter film, this one will certainly work.  Don't forget to bring your barf bags (and some pork buns).

If someone is looking for some seriously depressing horror (like Schramm), the ""The Untold Story"" is not film to buy.  This is just one silly gore flick.  It is a nice addition to any splatter movie collection.  Anyone offended by kiddies being killed may want to avoid this trip.",1195430400,,1486,4.571969696969697

But what the costumers don't know is that the meat inside the dumplings are made from cooked human remains that Wong murdered, a police officer (Danny Lee) suspects something is wrong and investigate who is behind these awful murders that have been happening recently.

Based on actual events in Hong Kong and Macaou, this brutal and grisly horror comedy drama is one of international cinema's most violent movies ever. The performances by the actors like Hard Boiled's Anthony Wong are very good as he perfectly plays the cold blooded killer and there's scenes of shocking violence and realistic gore that maybe a little difficult to watch especially a whole family with the kids getting slaughtered and of course a graphic rape sequence you won't forget. There is some dark comical moments to make the film a little more sleazier, it's not for the faint hearted but it is an interesting study of an actual murderer.

You know what I'm talikng about.
Right when the knife's about to fall;
and the camera decides now is the appopriate time to look over at the tile pattern on the bathroom wall.
Remember how cheated you felt?
Well this is the first movie I've personally seen that had me thankful for that squeamish camera.
Not every scene mind you,
Just the ones concerning chopstick rape, and child murder.
In those scenes you don't need to see the violence,
'cause you feel it in your stomach.
There was however an attempted suicide scene shown in full detail;
where our antagonist drags his wrists back & forth
across the jagged edge of a rusted basin.
And when that doesn't seem to cut it,
he decides to tear them open with his teeth.

The story concerns ""The Eight Immortals"" Chinese Restaurant and its current owner,
(Who just so happens to have to killed the previous owner,and his entire family.)(kids too)
Investigating the case is the most slapstick group of cops this side of ""Police Academy""
And when ""they"" start getting close he starts killing off his staff and grinding them into pork buns.

As good as it is;
the tension in this movie is undermined by its humor.
Every scene with the owner, makes your skin crawl,
however every scene with the detectives tickles your funny bone,
So what you ultimately wind up with is a disjointed feeling,
like you're watching two different movies at once.
It either should have been a comedy or a horror movie, not both.
If the director seriously wanted it to be both,
it should have been seamlessly blended as one.
When this movie tries to make you laugh,
it comes across as feeling kinda cheap
But when it aims to make you cringe,
boy will you be cringing.
Like I said,
there'll be scenes, when you're gonna be thankful the camera bailed out.
And when it doesn't.....
You're gonna wish it was showing you
the pretty tile patterns on the bathroom wall.

857788,5,6304378033,"'The Untold Story' is purportedly based on a true story. If that is indeed the case, this film is one of the more horrifying endeavors I have had the pleasure to witness in all my years. Even if it is not, this still quite a film...

Herman Yau directed this HK horror masterpiece masterfully. Anthony Wong (as Kai) gives one of the most convincing psycho performances I have ever encountered (at that's saying a lot)...

The story is a relatively simple one (albeit very effective). At the outset, Kai and his boss have some sort of monetary dispute involving gambling and cheating. An argument ensues, at which point Kai than proceeds to go sickhouse, and kill the man... Fast forward 8 years...

Kai is running a restaurant. Mysteriously, the previous owner and his family are nowhere to be found. As the police and various people begin to inquire about how Kai came into ownership of the restaurant, the questions begin to pile up (as do the missing bodies)...

Kai, being witty as well as psychotic devises a clever and creative way to dispose of the various bodies that he has created. By the way, don't eat the 'pork buns'...

Eventually the local police (who are portrayed as silly, Police Academy-esquire buffoons) become suspicious, leading to the arrest and eventual imprisonment of Kai. Torture and brutality ensue, culminating in a coerced confession presented beautifully and horrifically by Yau...

Much has been made of the violent and wicked nature of this film. Perhaps I am jaded, but I did not find this film to be gratuitously violent. All of the violent and wicked acts depicted were in context, and served the purpose of showing what a monster Kai is..

This may sound like a rather simple film. Plotwise it is. However, the story was well-constructed, and Yau's capable direction keep things moving forward engagingly so. This is a captivating and enthralling story, all the more incredible because it allegedly happened. If you love a good true crime/horror story (and are not of the squeamish variety), you will most likely find this to be a fascinating and well-done film...",1169164800,3,2101,4.884831460674158

It was pretty serious-minded unexpectedly. I can say the movie is directed well and the acting really surprises sometimes. Expecting it to be extremely graphic and shocking I was a bit baffled at first - there was a couple of gross scenes in the beginning and then nothing. In general the first part of the film is a little slow-paced and seemingly dull, but you definately have to wait for the second one. That's when everything happens. Including the part with the whole family murder which is done just gruesome. I couldn't imagine it'd be like that.

Now I can say ""The Untold Story"" tops many other similar films regarding its viciousness and brutality, the music adds a lot of mood being one of the key instruments here.

Truly, the story of people being murdered, dismembered and then fed to others as ""barbecue pork buns"" shocks and stays with you for a long time. The only things I disliked here were those humorous moments involving the police - strange jokes and silly acting. Without all these the film would be as twice as powerful.

857791,5,6304378033,"""Untold Story"" (Original Cantonese title (romanized); Baat sin faan dim ji yan yuk cha siu baau) certainly goes to the extremes of serial killer horror. The violent scenes in this movie are some of the worst I can recall ever having seen. And I'm not quite unexperienced on the matter; besides having seen nearly all mainstream horror/slasher/gore-films in existence (which generally has relatively limited amounts of violence) I've also seen the gist of the more notorious cult films of the horror/slasher/gore/exploitation genres (including, but far from limited to; ""Cannibal Holocaust"",""Cannibal Ferox"", ""Sal&ograve;"", ""Bad Taste"", ""Braindead"", ""Pink Flamengos"",""I spit on your corpse, I piss on your grave"", The Guinea Pig series, The Virgin trilogy, ""Evil Dead Trap"", ""Bloodsucking Freaks"", ""House of 1000 corpses"", ""Ichi the Killer"", ""Kichiku Dai Enkai"", ""Men behind the Sun"", ""The Devil's Rejects"", ""Murder Set Pieces""). Now, while these movies range from exploitation comedy/trash to slasher/serial killer films they all more or less contain elements of violence to a greater or lesser extent. So, in all humbleness, I should be entitled to comment on the violence ""Untold Story"" portrays with at least some credibility.

(WARNING; MAYOR SPOILERS)

The story, set in Macau, revolves around a psychopatic cook/restaurant worker, Wong, who has killed his boss including all of his nuclear family over a game of mahjong. Wong ""wins"" by cheating, making him insist he is entitled to some 183,000$ (Hong Kong dollar). The following dispute thus results in his murder of boss Cheng and his entire family (though this first is shown at the end of the movie, in retrospect). Wong is also involved in a previous murder in Hong Kong, as we see in the opening scene. As will be a familiar method of disposal later in the movie, he grinds the flesh of the bodies and uses them in ""human pork buns"", serving them to customers. After some limbs wash up at a nearby shore in Macau, the police start investigating the matter. The police investigation makes up about half of the film, in effect adding a definite crime/thriller element. It is also through the investigation crew, led by Officer Lee, that the comic relief is given, with the three clumsy and horny guys (always checking out Officer Lee's newest ""girlfriend"" and the self-confident Bo who don't seem to be taking their investigation too seriously. Later Wong also kills his two employees before he is caught and incarcerated, facing a harsh prison environment and leading to his confession and later suicide.

The violent and/or gory scenes in the film are;

1. The immolation of a man in the opening scene (the Hong Kong murder)

2. The disembowelment and dismemberment of a pig

3. The killing, disembowelment and dismemberment of a cook/waiter, and the grinding of his meat and offal into pork bun filling.

4. The graphic rape and murder of a female cashier/waiter, killed by insertion of chopsticks into her vagina.

5.  The graphic murder of Wong's boss Cheng Lam and his family. Cheng's youngest son (at about 3-4 years old) has his throat slit, Cheng's wife is stabbed in her stomach, two daughters (some 7-10 years old) are slit in the throat, one graphically decapitated on a table.

6. The killing of Chan Lai Chun, Cheng Lam's mother in law, and the following dismemberment of the whole family

(SPOILERS END HERE)

Despite the somewhat inferior acting by the police investigation team as a result of the so called ""comic relief"" that is supposed to give, both Wong's and his victims' acting is irreproachable. Wong himself is so convincing as a creepy sociopath that he easily could be mistaken for a real one. As for the violence, it's seriously graphic, and will be disturbing for anyone unaccustomed to cult film violence or violence in general. Sure, you will find films that contain much stronger sexual violence (""Murder Set Pieces"", ""Irreversible"", ""August Underground Mordum""), more gore (""Bad Taste"", ""Braindead""), more dismemberment-in-action (""Flower of Flesh and Blood"") and far more explicit cannibalism (""Cannibal Holocaust""), but ""Untold Story"" combines these elements with a totally believable plot, redeeming qualities and great editing. Thus, hadn't it been for the stupid, so called ""comedy"" that the police investigation team at times provided, this would be a perfect ""serial killer/insinuated cannibalism""-movie. Especially if the investigation team would be as interesting as in, say, ""Se7en"" or ""Saw"", and the atmosphere had been more sombre. Yet it still ranks high among ""Se7en"", ""American Psycho"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" in quality and entertainment value, IMHO, even though it surely is a different experience. Moreover, this isn't simply a gore fest exploitation flick; there's also insinuated cannibalism as both several customers and the investigation crew themselves have a treat to Wong's special ""human pork buns"", which also adds a dark wit to the story that I found appealing.

If you're a fan of horror in general and/or cannibal serial killer movies with crime/thriller elements in special, you should definitively give this one a try. If you like this one you can try ""Dumplings"" as well, another Chinese cannibal film, revolving around a beauty expert offering special dumplings containing aborted human foetal meat to alleviate symptoms of aging.  All in all, ""Untold Story"" is an impressing effort of a serial killer movie that in my opinion manages to incorporate the good qualities more often found in mainstream cinema (a proper plot, in part convincing acting, fitting editing etc.) and underground/exploitation cinema (excessive ( i.e. satisfying amounts of) violence, gore and limbs) to a successful end product. Both in-your-face shocking and indirectly disturbing. Thumbs up.",1152662400,2,5822,5.252960172228202
857792,4,6304378033,"There seems to be some controversy about whether or not this is a true story.  I can only speculate but I tend to believe this is a true story due to the straight-forward nature of it.  There are no wild twists or exaggerated story line.  Just a guy who went on a killing rampage attempting to take over his boss's business.  The police figure out it's Bunman without him being to deceive the facts in some elaborate storyline.  The movie is pretty much straight forward violence from beginning to end.  Guy commits violent crime.  Police arrest him and do violence on him in jail. etc.  It seems to me this is pretty much how something like this would occur and it is likely a made-up story would have events that didn't fall in such a natural predictible fashion as they would in real life.

The film not embellishing the storyline does work in its favor by not diverting attention from the violence.  The acting is top-notch and is perhaps the only convincing ""psycho killer"" acting job I have ever seen.

The film also works surprisingly well in having a lot of side comedic aspects mostly involving the police.  I can't explain (and probably can't understand) why this itself didn't divert attention from the violent realism of the story.

That is not to say the violence is realistic.  I don't know of any film that has portrayed dismemberment in graphic realism and this film uses the standard techniques of having the chopping occur offscreen with blood flying into frame and onto objects.  But as far as the limitations of showing the ""uncreatable"", this movie was as effective as any I've seen in this area.

The thing that really carries this movie is Anthony Wong's acting.  This is what I would imagine a real life ""Bunman"" (if there really was one) to behave.

I don't think a movie like this would be made in the U.S. even by the most independent of independent producers.  One scene is particular has Bunman mutilating an entire family with young child actors with Wong acting in the most intense psychotic way possible in a room full of severed body parts and blood, as well as the children being splattered with blood.

This movie is enjoyable to watch mostly because it is fresh due to there not being others that I know of that are anywhere similar.",1117238400,3,2269,4.625

start by saying that this is the only film in all my

years of moviegoing that actually nauseated me.  Give

me credit.  I have a very strong stomach.  Maybe what

makes it so horrific is that it is based on true

events.  I thought I had seen it all...now (maybe) I

have.  I love horror, gore, frightening tales of

terror, but this one crosses the line.  It is

shocking...to say the least...and it doesn't start out

that way.

The crew of police officers and detectives in this

film are a bunch of comedians.  They are constantly

ribbing one another...find excuses not to work...and I

Gibson and Danny Glover in ""Lethal Weapon"".  In

afterthought, their comedic relief is to take pressure

off the gruesome antics of a psychotic killer Anthony

Wong, who won Honk Kong's Film Award for Best Actor in

I had to buy the ORIGINAL UNCUT VERSION!  Guess what?

There's nothing ""uncut"" about it...if you get my

drift.  Words of wisdom:

Stay away from the barbecued pork buns and beware of

the chopsticks.

be selective as to who (if anyone) joins you.  I've

Serial Killer"", ""Bundy"", ""Helter Skelter""...and a host

of deranged serial killer flicks, but this one takes

For those of you used to Anime and other far-out Asian arts, you may be already jaded and unaffected, but for those of you looking for something to disturb you, seek this out. It's not an atypical story by any means, but the murder scenes are pretty grisly. It's not quite all out gore, but it's pretty disturbing in that you're just not used to this kind of stuff.  One guy gets chopped up into dim sum. In another sequence, a family gets hacked to pieces...you ever notice in Hollywood where murdered children get killed offscreen? Not here. There's also a graphic rape scene involving chopsticks that ain't exactly feminist-friendly. Needless to say, with every succesive murder during the screening. more and more people walked out. It's rare you see a horror film provoking anything more than laughter nowadays. This one is all out, gung-ho savagery. What's even weirder is the moments of slapstick that pop-up whenever the cops are in a scene. A strange way to lighten the darker scenes, but, that's Asian cinema for you...unpredictable, daring, extreme and the polar opposite of Western filmmaking.

857919,2,6304378033,"""The Untold Story"" runs on the false assumption that a movie with lots of graphic violence is brilliant by virtue of it's ability to shock the viewer. Truth be told, if you look past the violence, you are left with a very amateur-night production with terrible acting and even worse writing.
Anthony Wong plays ""Bunman"", the owner of the ""Eight Immortals Restaraunt"" in Macau who claimed ownership after the previous owners mysteriously disappeared. When body parts wash up on the beach, a police investigation ensures and eventually leads to Bunman's door. Then the bloodbath begins. ""The Untold Story"" is based on the true story of ""Bunman"", apparently only of Macau's most notorious serial killers (think of the inspiration for his name--he killed people and fed them to his customers). It was a sensational story at the time, the Chinese version of Ed Gein, so to speak. But the fiction is easy to spot in the movie. The police are a bunch of sexist animals who seem content to pick on their only female officer than to solve crimes. Had the police been so stupid in real life, Bunman would have never been caught and would now have a franchise.
In theory, this could have been a great movie. In production, however, it is hardly watchable. The writing is where this movie really breaks down, unless unfunny sexist humor and frequent 4-letter words are your cup of tea. Contrary to what many people will say, this is not a psychological thriller. In ""Silence of the Lambs"", we got a glimpse into the mind of a brutal serial killer. In ""The Untold Story"", we get Bunman killing people in brutal fashions without any insight into his mind, his madness, and the surface is barely scratched on his motives. There is plenty of violence, including some particularly nasty murders, but nothing else of substance. The movie might have benefited from the title ""Friday the 13th- Macau Style"".
People who praise this movie as ""Brilliant"" and ""Thought provoking"", I can only assume, were so numbed by the violence that they failed to spot the flaws. Perhaps that is the one area ""The Untold Story"" succeeds, it's tricks viewers into thinking it's a real movie.",1041033600,13,2153,4.821621621621621

There are some distrubing scenes, but only the last one is as nasty as anything I've ever seen.  I can handle seeing Wong set fire to some guy, chop up another and make an appetizer out of him, rape and kill a woman who works at his resturant, amung other things.  But the final scene, where he kills the resturants previous owner and his entire family is a little unsettling.  Just to see five children get butchered the way they did, even seeing one little girl have her head chopped off with a meat cleaver, is pretty bad.  Maybe it's just because American films never let you see a child getting killed, that this is such a shock to us.  But even though all of these acts are brutally displayed in this film, it was still an excellent achievement.  Wong is unbelievably believable in his role.  Also, Lee does a good job as the chief of police, and is always arm and arm with several different prostitutes.  Since this is based on a true story, it makes it all the more interesting.  The DVD is nice, with full motion chapters, trailers, and more.  The transfer is quite good also, and the sub-titles are super clear.  No complaints at all with this film.

I don't know if it is knowing this was a true story, or the intensity of the killers acting, but this movie draws you into the story and makes you watch as a helpless bystander.
I think the best thing the movie does is show how homicidal maniacs have Jeckle/Hide personalities. The movie never paints the killer with the same broad strokes it unfortunately paints the rest of the cast. There are scenes where I found myself feeling sorry for him, times where he looked like people I know, and times where I could almost like him.

I hope Amazon Prime would read my review and do something about making this type of GRAPHIC HORRIBLE RAPE SCENE movies available with large print WARNING.,1466812800,,609,4.688679245283019
7869434,5,6304378033,"This is a tragic movie based on true events that took place in Hong Kong and Macau, in which human bodies were chopped and then cooked into foods such as pork buns, or dumped into the ocean, or flushed down the toilets.  The events continued to happen long after this movie was made, but it was shocking when it first happened in the 1980s and into the 1990s.

This movie was just as shocking and gory when it came out because it was a time when Hong Kong movies had no limits on what they were willing to film. Sex and gore sold at the time, and the movie makers went to the extreme to demonstrate the extreme nature of these events.  It had to be shown this way for people to really understand the crazy animalistic nature of a psycho and how sick people can be when they have lost their souls.  It's one of those movies that you don't want to watch it because it's so horrific, yet it captures your attention to want to know how far things can go, and boy does this movie just go all the way on what took place during that period.  This same story probably could not be filmed this way today and that is why this film is so valuable because it can't be done again.  The main actor in this film, Anthony Chau-Sang Wong, is now one of the most famous in Hong Kong as he has played Ip Man:The Final Fight (Bruce Lee's master) in recent years.  I bet if you ask him to do this film again, he wouldn't be able to as his acting career has much matured.  It shows how talented this actor is in his ability to take on tough roles.",1465776000,2,1525,4.111111111111111

7869438,5,6304378033,"Could this be one of the most important stories ever told?

Many people, when faced with problems at work, resort to the practice of butchering their colleagues and cooking them into human meat roast pork buns. Of course, in America, we call those ""hamburgers."" This time-honored tradition is a rich part of our culture, but is there a better way to deal with interpersonal problems? Maybe homicide and cannibalism shouldn't play a role in the workplace? It sounds like crazy talk to me, but this movie shows how what we think of as a normal reaction to job frustration might not be entirely healthy and may lead to negative consequences. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't suggest any alternate solutions, but maybe examining this practice is a good first step. It sure made me look at my own behavior in a new light!",1452124800,2,817,4.794326241134752

7869440,5,6304378033,"DVD Review: Tai Seng Version. Very long out of print. The 1:85 ratio picture quality is Grindhouse like picture WHICH IS PERFECT and it isn't formatted properly on widescreen TV (small picture) but it's all watchable and audio is great. This movie comes with audio commentaries and bios and in Chinese language with very well written and readable subtitles (unless you're a blind moron).

Movie Review: YES! I paid $43.97 plus shipping for a movie I HAVE NOT SEEN! I am a moron. But my god, it was worth every f***ing penny. This is without question one of the best serial killer movies ever made, right up there with (for me) Manhunter, Dr. Lamb and Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer. Untold Story has to be the most brutal, demented, sick and twisted film I have ever seen. And it's a comedy as well. HUH?!? Everyone in this movie is f***ed up. Serial killer kills people, dismembers them and utilizes their flesh to make meat buns. Cops beat the s*** out of serial killer constantly and use sick methods to obtain a confession. Stupid Chinese pigs! But I really enjoyed this movie for it's psychological take on the behavior of a sociopath, it's extreme amount to violence (yes it almost beats Story Of Ricky BUT NOT BY MUCH THOUGH), the left-field comedy elements which never makes any sense to me for this movie that was meant to be dark and twisted, Anthony Wong's BRILLIANT PERFORMANCE and excellent direction from Herman Yau. I should also point out that this movie is not for the squeamish as children do die in this film in bloody-like fashion which is a rare thing in ANY form (cultural or otherwise) of cinema. I, of course, love it because I hate children and their whining in this movie was annoying. SO HURRAH, B****! Plus some minor rape scenes as well. I hope this film gets re-released very soon on Blu-Ray.

Conclusion: 4 1/2 for the DVD and 5 stars for The Untold Story.",1430352000,,1891,4.6083086053412465
7869441,4,6304378033,"If the police aren't busy beating a confession out of you, they're getting other people to do it! Seriously though this was a great film, the antagonist played a very believable killer. Hes not the typical silent killing machine like in most of these movies, he's a rage filled guy that cant control his temper. The gore scenes in this movie are effective (although the obviously fake limbs could have been better), although I don't think this is the ""ultra extreme gore movie"" that they make it out to be on IMDB. sure the violent scenes are violent but they'll be tolerable for MOST audiences.

Overall a good movie, the only thing I'd tell you is to be ready if you haven't watched Asian cinema before. There are a lot of things that wouldn't happen in a western movie in this movie. For example the police being the comic relief in every scene. Personally I found some of their jokes pretty damn funny but the humor and the way they act would not be seen if this was made in the west.

Just watch the movie, I guarantee you you will at the very least be entertained the whole way through.",1412812800,,1092,4.4278606965174125
