2697457,5,B000KT0FJW,I've had this DVD for appx. a week now and I love it.  She focuses on the abs and booty but I can actually feel it all over.,1232409600,4,124,3.4285714285714284
2697458,4,B000KT0FJW,I thought this video was great!  It was alot of fun and a great workout and only took 28 minutes!,1229990400,3,97,3.85
2697459,5,B000KT0FJW,"I have been using the Turbo Jam Series over the last year and I have to say that this one is one of my favorites. While I would not recommend this to anyone new to Turbo Jam, as some of the moves can be confusing to someone new and Chalene does very little queing,I would recommend it to anyone that has been using Chalene's workouts. Its fast paced and interesting, really working all your muscle groups but everyone is having a good time! Chalene has so much energy she really keeps you motivated. There are also some new moves that are really fun to do and its only 30 minutes long which is good when your short on time!",1225411200,6,623,4.243697478991597
2697460,5,B000KT0FJW,This Dvd is Awesome. I have almost all of her DVDs and I love every one of them.,1224028800,,80,3.5
2697461,5,B000KT0FJW,I'm in love with the Turbo Jam workouts. They keep me motivated. I wish to actually take a class from Chalene Johnson herself one day.,1221696000,2,134,4.4
2697462,5,B000KT0FJW,The DVD came quicker than promised and was very good quality. I would order from this vendor anytime.,1219017600,,101,4.666666666666667
2697463,4,B000KT0FJW,Enjoy the tape.  I like that it is 30 minutes long as my other turbo jam tapes are 20 or 40 minutes long.  Good work out!,1213833600,6,121,3.6153846153846154
2697464,5,B000KT0FJW,"I own just about all of these Turbo Jam videos and I love them.  This one is especially good when I don't have 40-60 minutes to devote to my workout.  It covers cardio, weights, and abs.  I would recommend this workout to anyone who has tried the Turbo Jam videos.  Great product!",1212624000,13,280,4.326923076923077
2697465,3,B000KT0FJW,"I LOVE Charlene Johnson and the Turbo Jam series, but I have to say I was sadly disappointed in this DVD program.  I felt it was really slow moving and not terribly challenging or effective.  I had a sore tush after doing the exercises but the program is not even close to as enjoyable as most of the others.  The Cardio Party DVDs are phenomenal and fun and I was expecting the same from this workout.  Sad to say...it will be shelved.",1182124800,27,436,4.280487804878049
2697466,5,B000KT0FJW,"The best workout, FUN!!! And you do get sore, sweaty and lose weight.",1428624000,,69,4.384615384615385
2697467,5,B000KT0FJW,Fun to watch them sweat more live!,1428105600,,34,4.0
2697468,5,B000KT0FJW,"I like,, this is great",1426809600,,22,3.6
2697469,5,B000KT0FJW,"This is one of my all time favorite workout DVDs. I have had it for ten plus years. It's only 30 min. Lots of squats with weights giving you upper and lower body workout at the same time. It's not super difficult but I keep coming back to it because it's short and fun enough. If you want to feel like you are dying while you work out then get insanity or p90x, I have them too, but realistically this fits better into my life right now.  I just want to be as fit as I can realistically be while also keeping a home and full time job.
 I like the people in the class, as silly as they may be at times because they are real students not paid professionals.",1422403200,,655,3.9923664122137406
2697470,3,B000KT0FJW,Not up to her usual videos,1420934400,,26,3.5
2697471,5,B000KT0FJW,one of my favorites,1415059200,,19,4.0
2697472,1,B000KT0FJW,THE WORST.. the entire video is spanning to the people working out acting like idiots not even doing the workout so you have no idea what is going on... which is actually ok since it's basically all squats.,1398816000,,206,4.447368421052632
2697473,5,B000KT0FJW,Have several of Chalene's workout video's and like them all and they work. This one is just the right amount of time for me - 30 minutes.,1395100800,,137,4.111111111111111
2697474,5,B000KT0FJW,"This is one of my favorite work out DVDs. She is happy, upbeat and the workout is fun while being very beneficial. I do this at least once a week.",1391904000,,146,3.9
2697475,5,B000KT0FJW,"When a workout is fun, you want to do it. This is another great Turbo Jam workout!  Not your typical resistance moves!!",1377475200,,119,4.409090909090909
2697476,2,B000KT0FJW,"I've been doing the Turbo Jam 5 Rockin Workouts dvd for a little over a week and enjoy it so I was looking for more TJ workouts to add variety so I won't get bored w/ the program.  I thought this would be good as an additional sculpting routine. I enjoy working with weights and am not a huge fan of dancey cardio tho I do like TJ.  This dvd is not a dancey, kick, punch routine and that is NOT why I was disappointed. Its mostly squatting and a few different arm/shoulder lifts w/ handweights and some 'wiggles' thrown in. (THAT is what I had a problem with)
While this routine was not difficult (intensity can be altered by increasing weights), some of the moves felt awkward and as if they could easily cause injury if not done correctly.  For example, there are squats w/ weights and arm raises w/ weights and it is suggested to 'groove' or shake your hips while coming out of a lift or squat. That seemed awkward and potentially dangerous to me. I fail to see if there could be much benefit to adding those wiggles to the routine but to make it have 'dance appeal'. I chose not to wiggle.
There was also a section where you sort of lunge and face right, then quickly pivot to face front, then pivot back to the side and do forward knees raises.  I managed to catch-on after a few tries but it seemed that, for some, it would be a great way to twist an ankle or a knee.
Even the ab floor exercises involved a lot of twists and put some strain on my back. I've had a back injury in the past so  that could be why I am more aware of these sorts of issues, i.e. paranoid!
I will still do this dvd on days when I'm short for time b/c it is only 30 mins but so far, its my least favorite TJ workout b/c its awkward yet still not very challenging.
This is definitely not for anyone at an intermediate level or beyond.",1375920000,4,1815,4.1303116147308785
2697477,5,B000KT0FJW,Booty sculpt and abs video by Chalene Johnson is a fun total body workout.  The exercise video is about 30 minutes long.  It is a great video to include with the Turbo Jam series.,1372377600,,179,4.235294117647059
2697478,5,B000KT0FJW,This workout DVD definitely gives you the results you want. Seller also shipped quickly. If your looking for the best at home workout system use Turbo Jam!,1370908800,,155,4.777777777777778
2697479,4,B000KT0FJW,"I have several of Chalene Johnson's Turbo DVD's and this is one of my favorites.  If you're short on time, this one is a good choice.",1359244800,,133,4.115384615384615
2697480,5,B000KT0FJW,I love all of the turbo jam dvd's.  They are fun so you forget you are exercising but you can definitely see the results.  I have been doing at least 5 days a week and sticking to a low calorie diet and i have lost 20% of my body weight in 3 months,1358640000,2,248,3.660377358490566
2697481,5,B000KT0FJW,Chalene's workouts are absolutely fabulous.  She makes you want to workout with all her great music selections and high energy.  I would recommend this to anyone!,1358380800,,162,5.1923076923076925
2697482,2,B000KT0FJW,"It feels like the instructor leads as though viewers have been in her class all along. She is slow with some of the cues and they at times are difficult to understand. This may cause a person to miss several reps on one side. The group seems to want to appear so cool that they look silly at times, trying to incorporate their own little dance moves in between the exercises. They look like they are trying to out do each other. It's annoying. Just focus and exercise please. If I want to see a dance contest, I can go to a club. The woman who is doing the modified version doesn't always keep it modified. The best part is the short portion of floor exercises for abs. Throughout the dvd, the mom of 7 looks fantastic and has great form as she works out. She's focused, which could be why she looks more fit than most everyone else. If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have purchased this video.",1357516800,3,903,4.22543352601156
2697483,3,B000KT0FJW,I use the abs part when I do the lower body jam dvd. Great to have for that but the other part of this workout is too sedate.,1357171200,,125,3.5
2697484,5,B000KT0FJW,"very good workout and it is only about 30 minutes, so if you are in a crunch for time, you can always squeeze it in.  mostly lower body stuff.",1350259200,,142,3.896551724137931
2697485,4,B000KT0FJW,I love all the tubo jam workouts and this workout dvd is just as fun as the rest.  Chalene makes working out a joy and the 30+ mins fly by.  I have turbo sculpt which is a longer workout and I feel a better/harder workout but turbo jam live booty sculpt + abs is fast and fun.,1349740800,,276,3.824561403508772
2697486,5,B000KT0FJW,"I love all of the Turbo workouts that I have. With a full time job and little kids, I have many videos to exercise at home as a gym isn't an easy option. Turbo jams are my favorite. They are fun which makes it go by quickly. It is a great workout for the time invested. That ripped lady that Chalene says has 7 kids is my motivation :-)",1327708800,2,336,3.8840579710144927

Amazon for a full refund terrible.",1319241600,,150,5.0
2697488,5,B000KT0FJW,"I've been working out at home for just about eight years now but only recently discovered Chalene Johnson and her Turbo Jam series. Where have you been all my life, Chalene! I have never enjoyed (really enjoyed, not just tolerated) working out as much as I do with Turbo Jam.

""Turbo Jam Live! Booty Sculpt + Abs"" is a 30-minute total body strength workout with that signature Turbo Jam ""gotta shake it"" soundtrack. For me, the pace is just fast enough to work up a nice sweat but not so fast that it compromises good form. Chalene hits all the standard muscles here, biceps, triceps, shoulders, inner and outer thigh, glutes, and abs. No chest, so push-up lovers might be disappointed (but push-up loathers, like me, get a break).

The best thing about Turbo Jam is that when I'm done, I feel great. It's a challenging workout that, for me, pushes me just up to my limit but not past it into complete exhaustion. There is no dread factor, which makes maintaining a workout schedule a whole lot easier.",1312934400,7,1002,4.592178770949721
2697489,5,B000KT0FJW,"I love turbo jam in general so it wasn't surprise that I'd fall in love with this one also. It's live so Chalene is a bit more outgoing and fun (she's always fun but she was really fun on this one lol)  It's not a long workout (only 30 minutes) but it gets the job done. You break a sweat and it gets the heart pumping. My favorite part is with the resistance band you can really feel the burn. (The Resistance Band and Free Weights are Optional but they are GREAT to use.) The ab part will not be difficult to anyone who's used to doing ""Ab Jam"" I had no trouble. I felt the burn but it wasn't agonizing. The weight training was good. One thing I will say is that this really isn't an ""alternative"" to ""Turbo Sculpt"" by any means. Turbo Sculpt is a much more intense workout but with that being said this one is a total body workout just not as much as turbo scuplt. I love it. And it's definitely added into my turbo jam workouts weekly. I combine it with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TURBO-JAM-FAT-BLASTER/dp/B000JZ2VB2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TURBO JAM FAT BLASTER</a>&nbsp;another must have.",1285891200,3,1145,4.841836734693878
