2945078,4,B000VL7VEQ,"I saw the movie, 'Killing Heat,' some years ago. It left quite an impression on me. Enough to buy and read the book by Doris Lessing titled, ""The Grass is Singing."" Was happy to find the movie, 'Killing Heat,' available on Amazon. It was just as powerful the second time. I thought all the performances were excellent. I especially liked Karen Black's performance!
Takes place in Africa in the 40's. Karen Black's character was happy and contented as a city girl and secretary in South Africa. She heard some gossip about her being a spinster. Upset by the gossip she married a very poor farmer, shortly after, and went to live on his farm miles away. She struggled to adapt to his hired hands and the conditions on the farm but was unable to.",1378080000,5,743,4.552238805970149

2945081,2,B000VL7VEQ,"I wish there had been a customer review of this DVD before I purchased it.  I own the VHS version of this movie and was pleased to see there was finally a DVD copy available.  I received the DVD and threw it on to watch it.  All I can say is, the copy I burned off of the VHS I have has better picture quality and is uncut.  This DVD release from Amazon was a waste of my money!  Unfortunately no reviews were available when I ordered which was around 2 months ago or maybe more.  Do yourself a favor if you're looking to get this DVD...buy the best quality VHS copy you can find and burn it off onto a DVD-R.  The picture quality will be just as good and the movie will be unedited.",1323129600,4,683,3.9779411764705883
2945082,1,B000VL7VEQ,"This movie might have been good in its original format.  The DVD I received was anything but in the original form.  In the opening scenes, the words ""In stereo where available"" appears.  Just like any movie does when it is broadcast over the TV. It only got worse.  The transfer was not good at all.  The dialogue was at times undecipherable.

I can not commit to the content of the movie because of the hacket job done to the movie.  Every violent or explicit scene was edited out.  This made the sequence of events difficult to follow so that the ending made absolutely no sense.

I would like to see this movie unedited, it might have made some sense.",1219104000,6,654,4.428571428571429

It's just a shame that the so-called DVD is only a bad copy from an even worse VHS copy with no menu or chapters... you just insert the dvd into the player and it starts!
