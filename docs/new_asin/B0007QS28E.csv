2236209,5,B0007QS28E,"I bought this DVD set because of a few chance encounters of this show a number of years ago on TV. It was a plesant surprise to find a show that doesn't portray Catholic priests in a negative light.
Fr. Duddleswell is a conservative priest that gets into trouble trying to do the right thing, but in the end always comes out on top..
Each episode has a sort of lesson or moral explained in a funny way.
Quite enjoyable and a little bit of nostalgia for those who long for the Church in its golden days of the 1950's.",1235865600,,516,4.17
2236210,5,B0007QS28E,I remember watching this on PBS with my Mom and it was flat out funny. A must have for a Comedy collection.,1231200000,,107,3.909090909090909
2236211,5,B0007QS28E,"I remembered this series from many years ago when it began being shown on PBS. It was pulled because of complaints.  I'm Catholic and I can't imagine anyone being offended at this show.  It's an affectionate humourous view of the relationship between an old, nearing retirement priest and his newly ordained young 'modern' curate.  Set in the late 1950s, provides a nostalgic look at the church.

Other reviews have provided details, so I won't repeat them. But I want to encourage Catholics who might be wary to give it a watch.  The teasing is good-natured and loving, not critical nor mean-spirited like so many shows aimed at the Church are these days.",1154736000,7,656,4.821428571428571
2236212,5,B0007QS28E,"Oh yes. I have been waiting with baited breath for The good Father Duddleswell to finally make it to DVD!  I was so happy to see this I could hardly contain me excitement when processing via the amazon checkout screens.

This was my first PBS Brit-com and trust me it has no equal in time or humor.  Father Charles Duddleswell is a total scream.  Yes it helps if you understand the world of Roman Catholic Religion but it is not really necessary to know it all.  The show sort of fills in enough blanks that even this old former Baptist Wolf got 99% of the jokes.

Father Duddleswell is funny because, he has so many wild old irish sayings.  Father D. loves the catholic church his charges, his wild and tart tongued housekeeper and his hopelessly innocent young curate Father Neil Boyd ( Curate is the catholic word for assistant preist in training.)

Together with his friends Billy Buzzle, a good hearted by rakish pub owner, friendly bookie and neighbor to the Parish of Saint Jude.  Saint Jude is the Patron Saint of Hopeless Cases by the way.  The visitors to Saint Jude are a scream too.  There is the always likable Doctor Day who carries his own bottle in his medical bag.  A man who drinks his shot with cigarette still in his mouth.  Guess the ashes filter out the inpurities for the good doctor.  The is the stiff rigid Reverand Mother Stephan whose lives by the utterly humorless yet  funny teachings of Mother Foundress of their order.

There are a few things that by todays standards would be considered very politically incorrect but they merely serve to add to the charm and beauty this 1950's post war British period peice creates.  This is comedy pure and simple but without the harsh more brusk and in your face humor of todays fare.  This is humor that is experienced indirectly via word games and inside jokes where the viewing audience is always included.

Father D had such wonderful sayings like.  There is no future in the past.  An example of politically incorrect is embodied in the following sayings, Wemen are like brooms they are useful enough but they can not stand up by themselves.  Ah yes that is as mixed up as an Irish stew or a womans motives to be sure.

These were offered by AMAZON on as cut up incomplete sets before now but never had the whole series been available in one package.  I did not EVEN have to think about IF I wanted to buy this BLESS ME FATHER DVD's and for this price oy vey, It was like the total no brainer of my life buying these.  If you love to laugh you can not go wrong buying Bless Me Father because you will never laugh harder at anything as good clean and wholesome as what you find in this series.  This DVD set is totally family friendly.  I can not imagine a family so uptight that they would find anything about this Bless Me Father the least bit offensive.

I must label this COMPLETE Bless Me Father DVD set ONE of the VERY BEST DVD offerings of all time.",1140825600,23,2929,4.424299065420561
2236213,5,B0007QS28E,"I first saw Bless Me Father about twenty years ago on PBS and loved it. I was thrilled when it was finally released for purchase on VHS. Now that we have bought the DVD, it is even better sound and so much easier to pick the episode you want. For those of you who have not seen it, BMF is a very funny show but it manages to be both gentle and respectful of the Catholic faith at the same time. Father Duddleswell is portrayed as so human  and approachable, and the interaction between him and the one who keeps him humble, Mrs. Pring, is classic comedy. This is a very well rounded show with characters that are lovable and imperfect, and very memorable.  Peter DeRosa (the writer) was the curate at one time, so his treatment definitely follows the axiom to ""write what you know.""  I would give it more stars if the system allowed me to do so. This is one of my favorites!!",1140739200,6,875,4.259036144578313
2236214,5,B0007QS28E,"Set in 1950, Bless Me Father is a classic 1978-1980 britcom about life within the Catholic Church, with the Church taking a lot of light-hearted, good-natured but very well-aimed pokes.  The late Arthur Lowe (Dad's Army) stars as Father Duddleswell, a very shrewd, penny-pinching, quick-witted Irish Catholic priest.  Father D (as he's known) is joined in his residence by his sharp-tongued and equally quick-witted housekeeper, Mrs. Pring, who knows Father D and his quirks all too well.  There appears to be no love lost between the two of them, as they take pot-shots at each other every chance they get; one gets the feeling, however, that they are dear to each other for all their comments to the contrary--after all, Mrs. Pring has neither quit nor been fired!

The first episode sees the introduction of Father D's new curate, Father Neil Boyd, who not only has a lot to learn about being a priest but has a lot to learn about Father D, who doesn't always act according to expectations.  As for Father D, he's not afraid of much, but he's met his match with the domineering, dour Mother Superior, a woman who could put the fear of God into God--certainly, she has Father D on tenterhooks whenever she appears!

Another frequent face is Father D's jocular neighbour, Billy Buzzle.  Billy is quite good-natured, but he's no push over, and his shrewdness is reminiscent of a used-car salesman--in other words, one would be well advised to check that all fingers are present and accounted for after shaking hands with him!  Though a non-believer, Billy shares Father D's fondness for having the odd flutter on the GGs (ie. the horses).  He also enjoys teasing Father D about his religion, and we are often treated to Billy's witty and often painfully accurate remarks.

Of course, one cannot forget Doctor Daley, the chain-smoking, whiskey-drinking old Irish physician who's as quick-witted as they come, which is a bit of surprise considering he appears to exist in a constant state of mild inebriation!  Never one to say no to a drink, he's quite a comical character--all the more so for his antics with a cigarette, which never seems to leave his lips whether talking or drinking!

Finally, fans of British comedy will enjoy quest appearances by Peter Bowles, Geoffrey Palmer, and Clive Swift, each of whom appear in an episode.

The dvd set contains all 21 half-hour episodes of this splendid, witty series.  Like all the classic britcoms, this is a series which lends itself to repeated viewing (and in my opinion only gets better each time you've seen it), which makes it good value for money.  It's a good, clean series which our family has watched countless times, and it's one which I heartily recommend to all fans of the very best in British comedy.

Very highly recommended!",1136851200,47,2789,4.852320675105485
2236215,5,B0007QS28E,"You need not be British, Catholic or even Christian to enjoy these shows. They present the hilarious antics of Father Duddleswell as he confronts head on the various issues and problems (such as counseling and fund raising) of a small town cleric. As noted by other reviewers, Father Duddleswell is not above a wee bit of larceny to achieve his goals, but he is ALWAYS acting with the best interests of his flock in mind.

The interactions between Father Duddleswell and Mrs. Pring, his housekeeper, are alone worth the cost of the series as are those between the good Father and his Protestant neighbor. But there is so much more including his education of the young curate!

The acting is superb as is the casting. Add this to the fine writing and situations covered and you have a thoroughly enjoyable series!",1126742400,27,812,4.75177304964539
2236216,5,B0007QS28E,"This is one of the best British series I have seen.  It is very funny, but not crude.  You can actually let your kids see this one, although I don't think they'd get many of the 'inside' jokes.  I love Father Duddleswell!  He is a cranky man, with a HUGE heart!  And of course, you have to love the wise innosence of Father Neil.  I get a good feeling after watching an episode of this truely wonderful series.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore.",1126051200,11,455,4.22093023255814
2236217,5,B0007QS28E,"Bless Me Father is the best dang tv program.  It helps a lot to either be an R.C. (Roman Catholic) . . . or at least to have a close friend who 'knows the drill' of what it takes to understand the Catholic's way of looking at the world.  Love  Fr. Duddleswell as he reminds me of Fr McCabe from my old days waaaay before I became a 'Recovering Catholic'.  I Love Fr Boyd for his humor and sweetness. And, Mrs Pring, the  housekeeper has just the right mix of 'sassy & sweet'.  Great fun all around!  Will watch this again and again!",1123545600,2,532,4.106796116504855
2236218,5,B0007QS28E,"The DVD set ""Bless Me, Father - The Complete Collection"" is an excellent buy. The pictures and sound are better than they ever were on TV! My only complaint: The DVDs have no Closed Captioning. (Only Amazon.com claims they do.)",1119830400,7,227,4.7
2236239,5,B0007QS28E,"This series is good clean fun. Father Duddleswell is a sweet but cranky Irish Catholic priest, and his interactions with his curate, housekeeper, and parishioners are clever and fun.",1454889600,,182,5.310344827586207

2236241,5,B0007QS28E,"This turned out to be much funnier than I expected.  Could be that as a protestant Catholicism has always been a little funny.  Or it could be that the show just got it right.  They mixed some of the awkward moments of religion with a really devout faith in god.  I think my life has improved for having seen the series.

2236243,5,B0007QS28E,"As with most British comedies, the humor is subtle.

2236246,5,B0007QS28E,"Years back when it first was aired on the ""Brit-Coms"", we enjoyed every episode. Father Duddelswell, the parish priest, never lets you down with his dichotomy of wit, sage understanding of human nature, and worldly greediness for a mere tuppence. His supporting actors all bear the scars from doing verbal battle with Father-D. And yet, they are also able to hold their own often enough to keep things interesting. Billy Buzzle, his nemesis bookie, and the Irish Dr., along with Mrs. Pringe, and the Mother Superior, round out to make every episode a worth watching again, and again. The ongoing Catholic vs. Anglican protestant schism never had it so good!",1439251200,,657,4.9818181818181815

Owning the complete DVD collection, many years later, has only deepened my appreciation.  If ever there was an authentic portrayal of life in the ministry, this is it.  Peter de Rosa hewed the scripts and characters of ""Bless Me Father"" pretty close to reality.  I thank him and the folks at London Weekly Television for providing me a solid framework so as to be entertained by thirty years of real-life ministry situations.  When ever I'm as frustrated as Father Duddleswell or as befuddled as Father Boyd, I think of them and laugh. It helps.",1384646400,,698,4.642276422764228

2236301,4,B0007QS28E,"Normally I'm not much of a one for priest and nun humor--unless, of course, they're walking into a bar with a rabbi and an imam. But Bless Me Father is an exception. A gently humorous little Britcom that follows a puffed-up rotund little Irish priest in England, along with his frequently baffled young assistant priest and a formidable old housekeeper who takes no guff--even from the pope's representative in the parish. A gem. Especially recommended for those who like their TV humor family-rated.",1380412800,,500,5.036144578313253
2236302,5,B0007QS28E,"Yes, there are actually some good clean sitcoms out there about Catholics, and here's one of them! This is an excellent show. It wisely relies more on smart scripting than contrived plots - in fact, some of the plots are rather ordinary were it not for the scripting. I first saw Arthur Lowe as the dimwitted Watson in the low-budget ""The Strange Case of the End of Civilisation As We Know It"" and didn't know what to expect out of him in this show, but he doesn't disappoint at all. His presentation of the cranky and contradictory Fr. Duddleswell will make you roll your eyes in frustration and chuckle at the same time. A fair bit of his humor is cynical or biting, but there isn't any hue of genuine malice or bitterness in this show. Daniel Abineri is pitch perfect as the pleasant, idealistic, easily duped Neil Boyd. Abineri is deserving but still largely unknown aside from this show. Gabrielle Daye's Mrs. Pring is just right with her blend of dour comebacks (when antagonized by Duddleswell, which is often) and kindhearted encouragement. Patrick McAlinney's Dr. Daley is wonderfully trenchant despite his frequent inebriation, and I only wish he had been a more recurring character (you can find quite a lot of him in about 6 episodes).

The comedy is clean and cute. Children could safely watch it, but adults are the ones who will really get the most enjoyment out of it.",1378771200,,1384,4.695473251028806

2236325,5,B0007QS28E,". . . British sit-coms ever!

I'll freely admit -- ""Brit-coms"" are a guilty pleasure!  And ""Bless Me, Father"" is one of the funniest, although only 22 or so episodes were ever produced.  From Fr. Charles Duddleswell (short, fat, elderly) to his brand-new assistant Fr. Neil (tall, skinny, young) to the sharp-tongued housekeeper ""Mrs. Pring""; to the ""Reverend Mother Stephen (who could ""put the fear of God into God"") this delightful cast of characters stumbles through one mis-adventure after another.

As a side note, I have been able to use some of these episodes in my profesional teaching role!

2236344,5,B0007QS28E,"I love this show.

If it was complaints from Catholics that got it pulled from PBS, shame on PBS for buckling to a small stuffed shirt minority of Catholics who certainly should have other things to complain about regarding the Church. (I am a practicing Catholic.)

The show is set circa 1950 and first aired circa 1980.  I saw it then and thought how dated everything was re: the Church and life in general.  Now that we are an equal distance from 1980, since we are circa 2010, I think of how the Church and life in general has changed since I first watched this series.

Buy it and remember a simpler time!",1256601600,,610,4.3628318584070795
2236345,5,B0007QS28E,"If you like clean, understated humor, this is for you. It takes you back to a simpler, more innocent time when priorities were more basic and realistic. Very refreshing. It feels like its all happening just next door. Lowe is simply perfect in this role. If he didn't win any awards for this he should have. The only dissapointment is that it ends so soon. I cant believe a show this good could only last 3 short seasons. I for one will wear out these DVDs.",1252195200,2,457,4.325581395348837
