7798908,4,1575672545,"This 29-minute DVD is one of Moody's Science Classics.  It takes a book written over 100 years ago when a European came across the sloth.  Many of his observations are now known to be in error.  He called the sloth toothless, and we see the sloths teeth for ourselves.  He called the sloth without any means of defense, and we see it has many ways of protecting itself. This is building up to the end when we will talk about the difference between any book of man and the Word of God, which is infallible.

It's a nice idea that was somewhat poorly executed.  We see the sloth firsthand in the lab, and in the wild, which is nice, and we learn a lot of interesting information about the sloth.  But, much of what we learn about the sloth is through the personable narrator Dr. Irwin Moon asking questions of the photographer/lab assistant.  Unfortunately, this man is camera-shy and somewhat awkward in his speech, and it would have been much more natural for Dr. Moon to relay the information himself rather than asking leading questions.

The often awkward method of teaching about the sloth is a significant detraction to me.  I'd rate this DVD 3.5 stars, but will round up to 4 because of the good spiritual lesson and the fact that most of us know next to nothing about the sloth.  If you're only going to get only a few of Moody's Science DVDs, there are better ones, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/City-of-the-Bees/dp/B000K6L5WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">City of the Bees</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/God-of-Creation-DVD/dp/1575672588/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">God of Creation DVD</a>.",1261008000,,1701,5.4541984732824424
