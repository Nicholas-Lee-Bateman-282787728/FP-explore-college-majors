7209097,1,B00Y8BNPRW,"I am beginning to worry about Mexico, no, not talking about migrants, drugs, corruption, poverty, but its TV and film industry. Even worse than Bollywood, it seems to also offer little in terms of creative thoughtful storytelling as well as the acting to go along with it. This entertainment is just another form of their obsessively popular beauty pageants and wealth & image displaying Catholic Institutions just to pick two parallel examples.
More of the same romance laced, peacock parading, monied caricatured themes pervasive in their TV & film. In other words this film, surprise surprise, had beautiful women, attractive males, both displaying above average wealth and all playing the romantic hook up games with subsequent betrayals, dust-ups. The plot? An attractive female is hired by her friends, and through word of mouth & social media, others to entice their prospective mates into betrayal in order to test their commitment. Of course things go awry when one of those guy dogs actually loves (yes, it shows up) her.",1438732800,,1031,5.142857142857143

7209211,4,B00Y8BNPRW,"I wasn't really expecting a lot from this movie, because let's face it, one thing that Mexican comedy/romance films don't have is originality. With US chick flick wannabe ""Csese Quien Pueda"", one of the worst films from last year, I didn't had high expectations from ""A La Mala"", starred by Aislinn Derbez, daughter of one of the most famous comedians from Mexico, Eugenio Derbez.

The plot, which is pretty original for Mexican movies, it manages to keep entertained the audience from beginning to end, showing us a little bit of comedy (if you are Mexican, you know there's a lot of cursing, which guarantees a lot of laughs during the whole movie) and drama. But at the middle of the movie, you know exactly how it's going to end. We have seen these kind of endings in Mexican movies and shows that they don't have the ""Wow"" factor anymore. But I was happy with how this expected ending was executed, it was funny, and dramatic at the same time. The cinematography is also amazing.

The movie also shows us a lesson learned for Mala, and you leave the theater feeling happy and joyful. After you watch the movie, you forget she's Eugenio's daughter. Aislinn is a charismatic actress that shines on her own during the whole movie, she's a talented actress with a huge future waiting for her. She's not like ""a famous comedian's daughter that got a leading role because of that"", she's really an amazing actress, and it seems that she earned the role and that she embodied Mala pretty nicely. Overall, this movie is an great comedy to watch with your family or your loved one, it's nothing we haven't seen before, but you'll enjoy the movie anyway. You won't want to miss it!",1439683200,6,1676,4.63973063973064
