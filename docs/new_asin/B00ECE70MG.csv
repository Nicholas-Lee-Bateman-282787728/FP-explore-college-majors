8603777,1,B00ECE70MG,Thisis areally bad movie with no action and no reason to watch Bad acting and a lame story are a bad combination. I was hoping for a good zombie flick but got this instead. Avoid at all cost. I will never watch my copy again.,1386547200,2,225,4.022222222222222
8603778,5,B00ECE70MG,"This film has a little bit of everything going for it. Horror, gore, action, thrill, and even bit of comedy. It reminds you of watching those 70's and 80's action films. And with action icon Fred Williamson crewing up the scenes with his trademark cigar you cannot expect more.  Just check the brain at the door and enjoy this zombie romp. And yeah its from Detroit so let the nightmare mayhem begin.",1380931200,,400,4.555555555555555
8603779,4,B00ECE70MG,"For a very low budget film, I'd say this movie was very good. It was extremely fun and exciting.

If you can look past some of the obvious low budget aspects of this film then you will enjoy this movie.

What I really enjoyed about this film is that it wasn't a typical shoot em up zombie film and nothing more. It had a story.

Moses(played by Fred Williamson) was terrific. He was very fun to watch. He brought his charisma and tough guy image Fred Williamson style to the film.

The lead actor Knox(played by Johnny Gel) is strikingly handsome and charming. He carried the film well. I look forward to seeing him in other films.

The main villain Rome(played by Jerry Lynch) is hands down one of the scariest villains I've ever seen. Freaky and creepy. If he creeps you out then that means he did his job well. I also look forward to seeing him in other films.

The music was great! Reminds me of an 80's classic.

Ryan Thompson(producer/director) did a great job with the resources he had. Looking forward to seeing more from him.

Give this movie a chance. You might like it.",1379462400,2,1080,4.41919191919192
