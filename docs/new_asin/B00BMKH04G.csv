5647653,5,B00BMKH04G,"This movie is awesome. It's probably one of the most tense thrillers I've seen in a long time. The setting is simple, a group of people get lost on their way to a resort and and end up in a house owned by a couple claiming to be Santa Claus and his wife. But things immediately get tense when you realize who the cast is made up of.

First we have the dad, Gary Daniels, a martial arts master who has beaten to death a minimum of 3 people in each of his films. And then you have the Mom, action movie star Kathy Long who has built a career on ripping off the manhood of her assailants. Just when you think things can't get any more action packed, Daniel Bernhardt shows up. Now this is another Martial Arts master (literally, he had a school, look it up) who can put you in the hospital with an errant thought. So now you have a group of known butt kickers who have all been taken to a remote home in the mountains. More and more it became obvious that the driver didn't get lost, no, this was a kidnapping. And they would have to fight their way out using the years of training and experience they've accumulated .

But wait, this isn't going to be a cakewalk for this group of karate vacationers. Because Mrs Claus (who just may be a kidnapper), is played by none other than the legendary Cynthia Rothrock! That's right, 5 time world champ, and easily the most lethal woman in the history of cinema is playing the `wife' of Santa Claus. Now you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know what comes next. Every frame of this movie was pointing towards an epic beatdown between the characters. And thats where the genius of this film comes in.

The tension builds and build throughout each scene. You know that at any moment one of the stars may bust out a roundhouse kick into a wreath or stab someone in the neck with a candy cane. Scenes like the one with Gary Daniels and Kathy Long kissing are so tense that I had to look away because I was sure Kathy Long was going to snap her husband's neck before he got the chance to break her arm. The part where the son and Cynthia Rothrock are alone on the couch is a triumph of contradictory acting. While he is fighting the urges of his rapidly surging hormones as he snuggles beside the gorgeous Mrs. Claus, she has to fight the urge to use her intimate knowledge of Eagle Claw Kung Fu not to rip his eyes out. It's a sight to behold. I won't spoil whether or not the son makes it off of the couch without injury, but I will say that I'm sure that young actor will remember that scene for the rest of his life.

But the crown jewel of this film is the near 30 minute section where we watch the group of vacationers (prisoners?) play an entire game of croquet. I was astounded by the filmmaker's choices here. By forcing the audience to watch this extremely extended sequence, which has nothing to do with the plot and doesn't have any real character building portions, they are placing us through the same type of captivity that the characters are in. They can't escape, and neither can we. Fascinating. And again, knowing that at any moment, any of the  cast members could use their fighting skills to turn the croquet mallet into a lethal weapon and crush another characters skull kept my heart beating furiously. The tension that builds in scenes like this is extraordinary. And there are a lot of them.

I won't give away the ending on whether or not Santa's Summer home turns into the bloodbath of martial arts action that the cast is capable of. I will say that the end result was a courageous path on the part of the filmmakers and something I don't think anyone else would have done. I enjoyed this film and I hope the cast had as much fun making it as I did watching.",1382227200,4,3727,4.294452347083926
5647654,1,B00BMKH04G,"With a title like ""Santa's Summer House"", I expect a magical adventure with a believable Santa that warms my heart and entertains me.  Maybe a little comedy or at least good acting.  I was completely disappointed.  I love Christmas movies, and I own a ton, I expect corny, but this was just bad.

This was obviously a very low budget movie.  It transitions from scene to scene with a  piece of bad clip art scrolling across the screen.  The entire movie is droning dialog about these peoples problems.  Nothing magical or wonderful.  Nothing that remotely looks like the cover.

SPOILER ALERT ( well if you can consider this a spoiler)
Santa's big gift to everyone is a photo of them taken by one of the characters.  When did Santa start taking credit for other people's work?  This movie was not only bad, but offensive to the photographer in me that Santa has no respect for copy right laws and proper credit.  This Santa stinks, move on to the many many much happier holiday movies.

Pros:
It has an ending.

Cons:
Everything else
low budget
boring
no magic
no fun
depressing",1382227200,,1078,4.6

It's no good to dwell on things that never were, but I spent the entire movie thinking how much cooler it would be if they were all fighting each other. It would certainly have been more entertaining, because ""Santa's Summer House"" is far from a new Christmas classic.

The story: A mysterious fog brings a van of vacationers to an isolated villa on the sunny California coast, where a jovial couple (Mitchum and Rothrock) offer them shelter. As it becomes clear that their hosts are none other than Mr. and Mrs. Claus, the guests are given the opportunity to address the personal problems that have troubled them for years.

To be certain, there is not one lick of action the film: no shootouts, chase scenes, explosions, or kickboxing of any kind. As odd as it is to see any of these stars in an entirely thrills-free movie, it's not entirely unexpected. For years, Rothrock and the like have spoken about their desire to branch out into other genres, and the family-holiday category was apparently among these. While this isn't a very positive review, know that the picture is at least better than the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/previous-film/dp/B00AAQ7L5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">previous film</a>&nbsp;Cynthia Rothrock did with director David DeCoteau (alias Mary Crawford). For all its faults, ""Santa's"" can at least keep its plot rolling and create the impression that it's building towards a worthwhile climax.

The acting is on the poor side. Daniels and Long do reasonably well and generate believable emotion in their roles as a troubled couple. Bernhardt's got more energy than anyone, but he loses the fight with the screenplay that turns him into an obnoxious jerk. Rothrock attempts to be wholesome and jolly but often comes across as a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stepford-wife/dp/B00026L8US/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stepford wife</a>. Mitchum's incredibly forced ""ho ho ho!"" is painful to listen to. Supporting stars Elijah Adams&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jessica-Morris/dp/B00008R9KZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jessica Morris</a>&nbsp;and Rachel Rosenstein don't elevate the standard by much.

The screenplay's pretty disappointing for its quantities of unnatural dialogue (""I was born to be embarrassed!""). Most of the individual conflicts likewise seem forced, with Jessica fretting that sister Rachel isn't growing up fast enough and getting upset that she practices photography. At one point, a game of croquet lasts for an uninterrupted eight minutes without any integral dialogue or development. Luckily, there are at least some nice moments near the end of the movie, (SPOILER) when Santa Mitchum gets his guests to confront their problems by having them read their old Christmas letters.

Technically, the feature toes the line between making the best use of its limited resources and just not looking very good. Expect to see a cheap budget reflected in the movie's production values, with corny transitional sweeps, time-killing environmental shots, blue filters instead of nighttime lighting, and the fact that the entire soundtrack is comprised of instrumental versions of holiday tunes that get quite old after a while.

In the end, this odd experiment is tolerable for 90 minutes but completely unworthy of that commitment. Aside from the fact that I still wish I could see these performers together in an action feature, their collaboration just doesn't amount to the kind of magical whimsy that one finds in the best Christmas movies. I do admire them setting aside the expectations of others to do a project that they wanted to, but man, I wish it could've been with a bigger budget and a better director.",1421193600,,4855,6.51937984496124
