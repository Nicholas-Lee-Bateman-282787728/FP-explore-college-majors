8086200,5,B000BG0AVC,"This is an old video I stumbled upon but is one that is very much worth reviewing.  I showed it to a class of recovering addicts I work with and their reaction amazed me - it left all of them in tears!  I could have heard a pin drop in that room.  They were more touched by this short video than by any ""bible study"" formatted video they have seen yet.  The stories shown are easy to believe, easy to see God's hand at work and one I would like to show those who believe and are still ""on the fence"".  I was so very happy to find a copy of it at Amazon!",1341532800,3,553,3.8157894736842106
