8574287,4,B00BUWD72K,"This DVD is well made and illustrates a lot of interesting U.S. military history. As a retired Marine, who now works as an instructor for international military students I was looking for a video to give my students a basic overview of our military. This is a good video for this, as it breaks down each service branch. However I had to cut it down to about 2 hours to the just basic main points of each service, as the whole thing is way too long for that purpose (its almost 7 hours). It can get dry at times and you really need to have a strong interest in this subject to invest that much time.  A great value for the $10 it costs.",1388793600,3,635,4.120967741935484
8574288,5,B00BUWD72K,"I picked up this great DVD for a bargain and found it to be absolutely fantastic.  This two-disc set is more than 6 hours in length covering the U.S. Navy from its beginnings in 1775 to 1914 and from 1915 to today. The origin and creation of the U.S. Marine Corps is also explained from 1775 to 1916 and from 1917 to today.  The second disc tells about the beginning of the U.S. Air Force from 1903 to present day. It also covers the U.S. Army from 1775 to 1899 and from 1900 to present day.  As a U.S. Navy veteran, I learned a lot of information that I was never aware of when I served aboard the USS Oklahoma (Guided missile Cruiser) many years ago.

If you love military history and desire to learn about the development of our armed forces you should check out this DVD set.  This is a 7-part documentary series in which I learned a great deal about our brave Americans who have served in the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force.

8574289,5,B00BUWD72K,"There was a clear and consistent effort to be as accurate and authentic as possible in the creation of this DVD series. The historical recreations are intense, mixed with allot of great original historical footage and also modern-day HD footage of our military in action around the globe.  All layered and detailed with great care in the special effects and historical truth and authenticity along with the powerful voice of narrator Coby Batty and other voice actors help to bring these stories of our branches of the military (and even the coast guard) to life.",1374364800,6,563,4.926315789473684
