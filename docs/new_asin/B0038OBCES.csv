4090814,1,B0038OBCES,I should've known better to think just to watch a DVD and can train my puppy. If it works so well there wouldn't be any dog trainers left out there.  I found that they either tried to cover too many topics in one DVD or not indepth enough in each topic. It's just too much to pay almost $70 plus shipping for this Volume 5 & 6 DVDs. For myself and I was disappointed. I do not doubt Mr. Millan is a great dog trainer but no way I can learn what he does from DVDs. The part for dog separation anxiety was just too short & too perfect.,1300838400,9,533,3.889908256880734

8391591,5,B0038OBCES,"I've had dogs all my life and for the first time I have one that's dominant aggressive especially on the leash, so I bought this DVD. I knew I was on the right track by trying to be the assertive pack leader because the dog is improving, but this video honed my skills. I simply needed to believe in myself more, own the situation, and make a few small changes in my behavior. I was ""being"" calm but now I also think calm, I own the moment with my confidence, and I use body language instead of voice command. These small changes are making an immediate difference.

I just happen to be caring for a friend's dog this week so the bit on walking more than one dog was very helpful. Again, its all about confidence and being the pack leader.
If your dog is scared of loud noises like fireworks, there's a bonus section about it that makes it worth buying the DVD. About an hour after I watched it someone set off 5 cherry bombs. My 80 pound, territorial alpha dog was immediately on his feet, stressed, pacing and whining. Normally I put a hand on him and say its okay, but this time I just stayed calm, ignored his behavior and kept doing what I was doing, and within a minute he was calmer and lay down again. I was on the right track before by not coddling him too much, but ignoring him and exuding calmness made all the difference. I'm going to try the other tips on the DVD to prepare for more elaborate and longer lasting noises like fireworks on the Fourth of July.

In conclusion, this DVD offers good, common sense information if you're already a confident dog owner. Even the DVD recommends to get professional help if you do have an aggressive dog. No time is too late and it is fixable, but you have to be willing to change.",1313798400,11,1735,4.286585365853658
