8073834,5,B000A2W682,Perfect service from AMAZONE and those pepole playing the music are GENIUS all of them Good blues and make you think about the old day's with HAMMOND and all that.

8073835,5,B000A2W682,"Looked at this one for a long time, not being familar with their music. Always love the history aspect of this period of music history I decided to take a chance and I'm quite happy to say that the concert itself is top notch in band performance, music style and superior production quality. Anyone who loves this kind of history will find  the documentry eqally inthralling. Elements of The Rutles & that movie Almost Famous are present along with great oratory and period film. I'll watch both concert and documentry now and again as it will stand up to repeated viewing.",1357430400,,573,4.673267326732673
8073836,4,B000A2W682,"I was making my usual bi-weekly stop at Looney Tunes in West Babylon to pick up the Good Times and I browsed the music DVD shelves before I left and found THIS. Definitely in the ""too weird to pass up"" category. I have no idea when it was originally released (the concert was 2004) but I'd have bought it sooner had I known of it.

This band was sort of a collision of blues with progressive rock. I have several (yes,vinyl) LP's, my favorite being ""Electric Savage"". The lineup went through several changes over the years but each version was blessed with talented writers.

The DVD itself is extremely well recorded and filmed. No expense was spared in it's making! The 'solo spots' of individual musicians were a bit long (never seems long to the PLAYER,of which I am one) but it appears everyone was having fun.

If you're a Colosseum fan this is a must-have. If not,and you can appreciate something out of the ordinary, I recommend it.",1319673600,2,940,4.550295857988166
8073837,5,B000A2W682,"This is one of the best concert DVD's I have seen.  It is so far better than most concert DVD's that are being produced today.  While it is excellent, of course it doesn't come close to the Talking Heads Stop Making Sense, which is in a class by itself.

This concert has been released in a number of CD's.  There are two separate CD's, one with some tracks from another concert.  And there is one that contains the whole concert.

This was filmed in 1994 and has a standard aspect ratio.  The video quality is mediocre.  The sound quality is good but not excellent.  There can be a little background hiss heard occasionally.  The sound is available in 5.0 or in stereo.  It has an annoying introduction before the titles come on.  It takes a few minutes before you can actually get to the concert.  I really like the Cream DVD in that it immediately starts up in the concert without having to go through some menus first.

So, now that I told you all the problems, what is so great about this DVD?

First of all the peformance is excellent.  This is a reunion concert, but it doesn't feel anyting like a reunion concert.  This is not a dinosaur band going through the hits.  They play each number with excitement and energy (except maybe for ""Those About to Die"", which is much better on the studio album).

But, what really makes this DVD stand out is how it is filmed.  The camera is always at the right spot at the right time.  Long camera shots are held on whoever is doing a solo.  Most concerts filmed today are done in pan and zoom mode, where the camera is constantly panning around and zooming in and out.  The camera in these DVD's is never in the right spot.  It is  cheap way to film a concert video.  You bring a crew in that knows nothing about the band and they just keep the cameras moving.  This DVD is so much more enjoyable to watch.

The DVD also comes with a great documentary on the band.  It has archive videos of the band and some of the other bands these guys were in before Colosseum.  The documentary goes through the whole history of the band, not just the current members.  It really gives you a feel for the progressive/jazz/blues rock scene in the UK in the late sixties.",1227484800,5,2203,4.339066339066339
8073838,5,B000A2W682,"I have had this concert on tape for many years. I decided to buy DVD because of bonus material (90 minutes) about the history of Colosseum.

The concert itself is one of the best you can see on DVD. The guys are in top form, especially Dave Clempson who is one of the best rock guitarists of all time. The guy plays beautiful and mind blowing solos, that I keep rewinding over and over.

But the bonus material gives a nice insight into the history of the group and its members, with many video clips. I hope that they will soon release a disk of video footage from early days, because that must be even better than the re-union concert. maybe the sound and video quality won't be as good, but who cares.",1145664000,,704,4.285714285714286
8073839,5,B000A2W682,Anyone who hasn't heard/seen this DVD is missing out. Jon Hiseman performs THE Best drum solo you'll see in a while over 13 minutes to take your breath away. Clem Clempson performs The MOST amazing Guitar solo. It's the ultimate Jazz/rock DVD. I have over 100 music DVD's and this is the one I'd take to a desert island if I was allowed one. What more can I say? Believe me - if you don't agree with me after hearing this I'll eat the other 99 DVD's. In fact I might do it anyway.,1119052800,4,480,4.117021276595745
