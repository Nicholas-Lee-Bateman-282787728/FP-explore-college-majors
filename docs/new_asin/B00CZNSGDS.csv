5763945,1,B00CZNSGDS,"One hour of redundant comments and just guys running, almost entirely male runners, all saying pretty much the same thing. Good advertising for running companies.  Nice scenery, though, and Kenyans were interesting",1402358400,2,214,5.6875
5763946,5,B00CZNSGDS,"Fantastic and inspirational documentary for beginning, intermediate and seasoned runners. Honest and realistic accounts of the rewards that hard work can reap, whether personal or professional.",1397606400,,193,6.461538461538462
5763947,5,B00CZNSGDS,"I run, but no more than 3-5 miles at a time 4-5 times a week. Despite not being someone who aspires to even do a half marathon and still perfers weight lifting over running, I do find my running to be an important part of my life and I enjoy watching longer races and hearing what goes on in the minds of other runners. Spirit of the Marathon was a movie I enjoyed and looked for other similar ones.

The last mile is mostly people talking about why they run and what they get from it, with some footage of actual running added in the background. I actually really enjoyed it and thought it was well done. Will be something I will probably wath every few months when inspiration wanes and for 12 bucks is a good deal. There reall isn't a lot out there that is similar. I did pick up Unbroken about the Western Stayes 100 and liked that one as well. A little more race centric in tht one, but both of these are great for running inspiration, even if like me you aren't doing 10,15, 20 mile runs or longer.",1394841600,8,1004,4.175257731958763
5763948,5,B00CZNSGDS,I have been a runner for over 35 years and many have asked why I run. I have asked myself that on more then one occasion. This film does an excellent job of answering that question from the perspective of several runners. It makes you feel good about being a runner and plenty of motivation if you need it. I plan to watch this many times.,1391558400,,339,4.151515151515151
5763949,5,B00CZNSGDS,"I was tipped off by a friend, shared it with my students, and have loaned it out repeatedly. Everyone I know who's watched it has come away inspired. Hardest part is watching the whole movie without hitting the pause button so you can lace 'em up for a run!",1377216000,12,257,4.26530612244898
5763950,5,B00CZNSGDS,I was hooked on it watching and listening to the runners~ very informative and inside view of what drives those who can't get enough of running. I'd recommend it for those who do run and those like myself just iinterested.,1372550400,3,222,4.575
5763951,5,B00CZNSGDS,"Fine remake of 30s classic movie. Slightly dated but still packs a powerful punch. Helped hugly by Mickey Rooney's towering performance as the doomed lead con. As he and his death row companions await their turn to walk 'The Last Mile' to the electric chair. Cliched now but still thrilling and entertaining. Aided by fabulously, stark black and while photography. And a dynamic jazzy score. The low budget doesn't hurt at all. One of Mickey's terrific gangster performances from this period. Now let's have ' Babyface Nelson' available on dvd.",1356825600,,544,5.055555555555555
5763952,5,B00CZNSGDS,Great film about the runners experience and what inspires them.  Need more films like this.,1430265600,,91,5.066666666666666

5763954,1,B00CZNSGDS,"The most self righteous, pretentious, and false introspective documentary on running I've ever seen. Sure, we all ask ourselves these questions. However, most of the runners featured here cared more about boosting their own egos than reaching a true understanding of what it means to be a runner. The truly inspiring stories came from the everyday people who have used running to better their life. Not the shoe guru who concluded that if he, an extremely successful and talented runner, was having a bad run then certainly everyone else must hurt worse, allowing him to overcome his pain and beat them. If you can get past the self
aggrandizing and get to the true and sincere stories, then maybe you will find meaning in this film. Otherwise, don't waste your money.",1419206400,7,768,4.870229007633588
5763955,5,B00CZNSGDS,"It is question that runners ask themselves or others ask "" Why do you run?""  This film tries to help understand that question.",1417219200,2,126,4.478260869565218
5763956,5,B00CZNSGDS,absolutely inspiring....beautiful people....love the sport even more now.,1417046400,2,73,8.25
5763957,5,B00CZNSGDS,Great documentary :)  I could have done without the dog analogy.  I wish it had listed the actual song titles too.  I have now watched it twice.,1416009600,,144,4.2592592592592595
5763958,4,B00CZNSGDS,Interesting although not what I was expecting.,1413158400,2,46,5.714285714285714
5763959,1,B00CZNSGDS,"I wanted it to be good, but there was so much NOT in the movie that it was a very frustrating watch. Why make a movie that relies on interviews with people who were an important part of running lore and not include film of them actually running?",1412812800,4,245,4.125
5763960,4,B00CZNSGDS,I can only says that my husband love it..I gave it to him as a present. He watch it couple times already..,1411862400,,106,3.8636363636363638

8587974,3,B00CZNSGDS,"I really love documentaries about running, but this one just wasn't that great. The people weren't super engaging, and there wasn't really a story. It was like a long commercial that never said what it was a commercial for. It just didn't seem to have a point. Running is great I guess? Plus, I don't think we heard enough from the filmmaker himself. It's so weird when a movie about running doesn't make you feel like going for a run. Honestly, it was just okay.",1468800000,,463,4.458823529411765
8587975,4,B00CZNSGDS,"This show was difficult to rate. I love running and it is all about runners...however, the production quality and content editing is not that great and it diminishes the film somewhat. Worth watching though, just not an epic.",1465344000,,225,4.947368421052632
