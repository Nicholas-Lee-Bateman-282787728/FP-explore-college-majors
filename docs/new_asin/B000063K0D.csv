1690708,5,B000063K0D,"This film moved me like no other. Having witnessed first hand friends of mine who have lost children to SIDs (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome), I could appreciate the sentiments and experiences of the characters in this film.

The cruelty of ""friends"" and the idea that the mother AND father who lost her child were now somehow ""unfit"" to be near, or have their [former] social circle's children near, was heartbreaking, and only too true in our so-called ""modern"" society, where everything must be ""just fine"" in order to avoid being shunned or rejected.

What is this curse that afflicts our white middle class, especially ""educated white middle class"" females? Why would this young couple be further punished, after experiencing one of the worst kinds of pain, that of losing a child? Why does our society have no rituals of comforting those who are bereaved, other than a church service and an ""Oh, I'm sorry to hear that..."" as if talking about it and, more importantly, EXPRESSING GRIEF OUTWARDLY is taboo.

Is death and grief so unacceptable in today's world that those that have contact with it, or inadvertently experience it, must be punished further? Is no comfort to be offered, outside of ""paying a therapist,"" ""taking medication"" or going to yet another group, this time a ""grieving group?""

Is it still ""Blame the Mother"" for anything and everything that goes ""wrong?"" Does nature, or ""the Creator,"" never have the right or the obligation to end a life for it's own reasons or purposes, or perhaps because something in a child did not develop right? Are we never to accept the natural events of life or of God or of anything that we ""don't like"" or ""don't expect"" or ""didn't plan for this to happen?""

Who can you sue when a child dies? Whose ""fault"" is it? Why is it so impossible to accept death in today's society, and why do we punish the mothers who are touched by it, and grieve the most in it?

Are we all ""supposed"" to be living a ""Martha Stewart kind of life?"" Does Death have no meaning or purpose in this world?

The actors were all cast perfectly and their dialogue was so natural and ""on the mark,"" it felt like they were in my own living room. I had wondered how far this ""idyllic"" pregnant mother's group would last, and to my horror and surprise, it didn't last past the birth of the first child in the group, to the most innocent of the group.

The cruelty displayed by all the couples towards the couple (both mother and father) who had lost their child was horrendous, heartbreaking and all too true, even in ""this modern day and age."" What will anthropologists have to say about us when they study our American culture as practiced by educated, middle class white men and women who are my own age?

The fact that this poor mother ultimately was forced to lie about being pregnant again to finally ""gain acceptance"" once again was truly heartbreaking, and a comment on how far ""friendship"" truly goes, in our ""average white middle class America.""

The director, Marc Forster; the writers Catherine Lloyd Burns (who also played ""Judith"" in the film) and Adam Forgash (writer and producer of the film), and all the actors are to be commended for their complete and accurate portrayal of our modern experience and reaction to ""death"" or anything that ""goes wrong,"" for that matter.

The ""witch"" of the women's group (the ""leader of the pack"") is particularly to be commended at giving such a perfect portrayal as the ringleader, who leads the charge in ostracizing the most beautiful and innocent member, through her own jealousy and greed. She doesn't even like her own children, but is so ""proud"" to be ""breeding"" again. Is she nothing but an ever-present and ever-active brood mare? Do any of these women have an ounce of compassion in their hearts? What do they consider ""friendship"" to be? Did ""witch trials"" ever end?

Marc Forster is the same director who brought us ""Monster's Ball."" This is a stunningly beautiful dreamlike film that quickly turns into a psychological nightmare, based solely on natural events and the human reactions to those events. Death touches us all, and we must learn to accept and revere it in the same spirit we supposedly accept and revere birth. It's all part of the same cycle, and we all ""live forever"" through the turning of this wheel.

""Everything Put Together"" is a must see film and one that will stay with you. Simply incredible.",1030233600,16,4402,4.723598435462843
7959367,4,B000063K0D,"An interesting experience. I have only one complaint and it's rather significant. The limited budget in obvious. Great performances, interesting framing and visuals are unfortunately overshadowed by a poor (enhanced even more so on HD) transfer. Too bad he (Marc Forster,  Monster's Ball) doesn't go back and remake this. It deserves better than its presentation here.",1462406400,,368,5.571428571428571

7959369,5,B000063K0D,"As someone who has experienced neonatal loss (my son died 11 hours after birth), I found this film to really, truthfully portray being that mother who has lost her baby. I think this could be a great tool to share with family & friends of a family who has lost their baby. Especially in ways how NOT to act & what NOT to do to them.

It's accurate to hear a baby crying at night when the room is empty. To want to just pretend everything is okay. To wonder where your friends went because they think infant death is contagious.

I'm really impressed with how they portrayed Angie's bereavement. Because it's exactly what I went through. I was her. I became isolated from my partner, my friends, etc. No one got it. I only wish she could have found support from others who had experienced what she had. That was the difference for me.

A++++. If you have lost a baby, have your friends see this movie! They might get a glimpse of what you are going through & what they shouldn't do as your family & friends.",1364601600,,1006,4.3121693121693125

7959371,1,B000063K0D,"I have seen films like this before.  They are fragmented, disjointed and don't make much sense, but you hang in there hoping for some kind of resolution in the end.  These types of films always leave you in the lurch asking ""What the hell was that all about?"" and kicking yourself for wasting your time.  This is just such a film.

Marc Foster's directing is horrible.  It seems he is trying to send some new age message and evoke something between a tear jerker and a horror film and falls short on everything with his weird camera angles and shots of food going down the garbage disposal.

We never understand Angie's trip to the storage facility where her deceased baby's furniture is supposed to be.  The facility is empty the first time, but when her husband takes her back, everything is in its place.  Was the first trip a hallucination?

We also never understand why Angie's husband's best friend thinks they should not be friends anymore or why he thinks their wives should not be friends.  And what is the ""accident"" he references?  We never find out.  Sure, people can feel awkward and act a bit distant after a tragedy, but it's only because they don't know for sure what is needed.  I don't buy that anyone would be as cruel as these people were portrayed.  I feel sorry for the writer if his/her friends are like this.

In addition to the above, the story is laborously slow and dull in the way it unfolds.

Don't waste your time on this; you will be sorry if you do.  I get the feeling the writer (and his fans) want everyone to think they have some special wisdom or insight, when in fact, they are clueless.",1355443200,2,1624,4.469387755102041

Angie (Radha Mitchell) is pregnant and is having course with her friends, Barbie (Megan Mullally) and Judith (Catherine Lloyd Burns), who are also pregnant. Her husband is in love with her, and they both are preparing carefully the baby's room. Her mother is a busy woman living in another town and does not pay much attention to her. On the delivery, Angie has a beautiful and perfect son, Gabriel, who dies less than twenty-four hours after of `sudden death', without any apparent reason. This is the beginning of Angie's journey to hell, with the loss not only of the baby, but also of her shallow friendships. This sad movie is very well directed by Marc Foster. All the cast has a great performance, but Radha Mitchell is magnificent. Forbidden for pregnant women.

7959373,4,B000063K0D,"If you think this movie has no point, you're not thinking hard enough. Monster's Ball used and abused Halle Berry to say something nice about white people--she was a heroine without a soul, another ""Magic Negro"" whose main purpose, finally, was to suggest something good about the white person on center stage. How dismayingly familiar. If you're a white person (like me) who liked Monster's Ball (unlike me), you should think about just why you liked it. (You probably liked Driving Miss Daisy, Ghost, The Green Mile, and countless other interracial greeting cards for similar reasons--think about it.)
This movie, though, is much more honest in its efforts to out some objectionable features of white, upper middle class-ness. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against white people, nor against white yuppies, as people. But despite what such people like to think, there are certain tendencies induced by being members of those two categories (and, of course, by being members of others). This movie is out to examine some of those tendencies, and it exposes them for the anti-communal, soul-crushing dangers they are. White yuppies can certainly avoid enacting such tendencies; however, when they're more or less surrounded by other white yuppies, and the only working class people of color they encounter are those who work for them (as depicted subtly in this film), well, it's difficult not to become excessively self-interested. The central character here--a mother who is shunned by her ""friends"" after a tragedy they should instead help her recover from--is portrayed as a victim of such tendencies, and the movie does so in order to expose them as dangerous.
This movie succeeds at this level of subtle social critique, but I'm giving it four stars because of its unfortunate reliance on cliched borrowings from too many horror movies, and for how long it spends demonstrating the effects of this tragedy on the unfortunate young mother. Still, it boldly goes where few filmmakers dare to go, challenging the shiny happy surfaces of upper-middle-class whiteness so unthinkingly projected nearly everywhere else.",1059523200,5,2122,5.207602339181286
7959374,1,B000063K0D,"I loved Monster's Ball, Forster's other film, and i rented this becasue it was done by him, but this movie is not touching, harrowing, ot really anything. it is boring! I was about to throw up with the crazy camera work in the beginning, then it settled down, and i was going to throw up becasue of the acting, dialogue, etc. This story goes nowhere. Ok, it has some nice moments. But it doesn't really have a point. it tries to be something that it isn't. there is not enough ""meat"" here. I would not recomment this film to anyone.

7959375,5,B000063K0D,"Everything Put Together is a harrowing look at what can happen in life when death shockingly intrudes where it seems not to belong. For the protagonist of this daring, deeply disturbing film it is the loss of a just-born infant that triggers the cataclysm. Having given birth successfully, Angie (who has had a joyful, medically uneventful pregnancy) soon learns from her hospital bed that her child has succumbed. She is torn in half. As the days elapse, providing some temporal distance from the event itself, Angie finds she has no way of coping with the terror her experience arouses or the longing for what was to have been. Her social network reacts to the horror of their friend's fate by distancing themselves quickly. Angie is suddenly unacceptable in her outsized grief and for having suffered an undeserved trauma that is frightening to comtemplate. Their lives are constructed upon the necessary premise that life in general proceeds at an orderly pace. Rips in the fabric of a person's sanity caused by unbearable events, especially when acknowledged by the victim in an unapologetic way, are too threatening to be tolerated. What they imply about our collective vulnerability and precarious sense of security is simply unacceptable in ordinary social discourse. Thus becoming a pariah adds to the intensely persecutory ambiance Angie gradually finds herself subsisting in. Marc Forster depicts this slide into exile and inchoate madness masterfully. But it is not until the point when Angie insists on seeing the post-autopsy corpse of her deceased infant that she begins to unravel precipitously. Up until then she has managed to hold herself together despite the onslaught of inexplicable loss and unappeasable mourning. It takes the actuality of what is impossible staring her directly in the face to break her. To his great credit, Forster has the courage and resolve to follow this unrelenting confrontation with death right down to every detail of its relentless claim. Everything Put Together captures the abyss of death absolutely brilliantly. It provides an emotional journey and catharsis for the viewer that is unforgettable.",1037577600,21,2150,5.252906976744186
