The recognition to unrated talent is wonderful and the directors intertwine the stories really well.  I happened to see this movie by accident and I am really glad I did.,1446940800,,299,4.94

As an entertainer myself, I know all too well how much heart and soul goes into competing. I feel like I want to know more about these people and it's reminded me of the joy I have for my own entertaining.  Fabulous film, and the music is so much fun!",1470268800,,344,4.4603174603174605
8616554,5,B00FKYYQ4M,"Highly entertaining video! Having known Adam Swanson for quite a while, I loved seeing behind the scenes at the Peoria festival where he reigned supreme! The video ends with Adam getting ready to head out to Durango for his first year of college. Having just finished his master's at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, he's currently getting ready to go off to college again--this time, to UC-Davis to work on his doctorate degree. Thanks goes to all the wonderful piano players at the Peoria festivals who helped him along the way.",1470096000,2,536,4.9010989010989015
8616555,5,B00FKYYQ4M,"A very engaging behind the scenes movie of ragtime piano competition, with colorful lovable people. I found myself wishing all of them could win first place but it could not be so. And the youngest player of all, really made me hope for the future of ragtime.  If you love ragtime music, you will most likely be entertained well by this movie.",1460851200,,343,4.532258064516129
