All of them are truly some form of nut in one way or another and combined its just a mixed batch of them. Liev Schreiber has been and still is my absolute favorite of all of these characters and Madeline Kahn is another one of them.

Really enjoy Steve Martin, Madeline Khan, Rita Wilson, Liev Schreiber and the entire cast in this zany comedy.  Each of these fine actors brings forth the eccentric personality of their character to congeal with other castmembers to bring forth a fine comedy.  In some respects, the much maligned fruitcake is my favorite character.",1482192000,,447,5.0

Everyone is worried about the serial killer on the loose. Mrs. Munchkin is going to sue him because he didn't tell her about the eviction and his other employee has a crush on him.

1649136,5,B00005QT9O,"Classic Christmas humor for those who yearn for something ""different"" at Christmas!  This movie focuses on the dysfunction and disappointment that can be felt in the holiday season but does it in a comforting ""you are not alone in your feelings"" way, and leaves you smiling...or out-right laughing.  The soundtrack is great  and can be purchased separately (we have it).  Liev Schreiber is at his best and Madeline Kahn is fantastic as Mrs. Munchnik...especially while stuck in the elevator!  We watch this every year during the holiday season.  If you tire of the Hallmark-style, old fashioned perfect Christmas movies...this ones for you.",1472947200,,640,5.2254901960784315

It has a ensemble cast of really good actors. It is a comedy about Christmas. What could go wrong? Pretty much everything. There are a few funny scenes in the whole thing. A lot of people are giving it great reviews but it does not deserve a gold star. I did not like Martin's films until he did LA Story. Watch it if you love a real Turkey!,1465171200,,476,3.96875

1649258,5,B00005QT9O,"One of my favorite holiday movies, one we watched with my mom every year. This is definitely anti-traditional (and I'm usually a traditionalist), but is truly funny and the characters are great. It's written by Nora Ephron, and has a stellar cast - Steve Martin, Madeline Kahn (RIP), Rita Wilson, Liev Schreiber (in his first movie role, according to IMDB) in drag no less - hilarious - Juliette Lewis, etc. etc. The acting and comedic timing are on point, and I've always loved Nora Ephron's writing. There are several issues played for laughs that I suppose this could be offensive, but it is played so farcically, I didn't take any of it seriously. I do recommend that you tread lightly - there are certainly mature themes that you may not want to explain to a little one. My mom passed away a few years ago, and I didn't have the heart to watch this until this year, but I'm so glad I did. Great movie!

Takes place at Christmas time, but fun to watch any time of year.  (Has one ""suggestive"" scene, but otherwise is for the whole family). Clean language.",1396656000,,421,4.56
1649282,5,B00005QT9O,This is a holiday staple like White Christmas and A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS.  The big name caste with great lines and awesome music make this a favorite every year,1395619200,,163,4.620689655172414
1649283,5,B00005QT9O,I don't know why I love this movie so much. It has a very young Adam Sandler in it and he is hysterical in it. I loved the story and how fast pace it is,1395532800,,152,3.3714285714285714
1649284,5,B00005QT9O,"When I first saw this movie at its theatrical release, I wasn't in love with it. I liked Norah Ephron, but I wasn't a big ""Sleepless in Seattle"" buff. I enjoyed the performances of the stellar cast, but it was much like viewing ""O, Brother"" for the first time. The film is witty, engaging, and darkly comedic. I left the theatre wondering if I actually liked it.

I found, however, that the movie grew on me after time. I have watched it at least 25 times, and I have learned to appreciate all the tiny nuances of each quirky character in the movie.

As the movie opens, one soon realizes that Steve Martin's choice of careers as the manager of a suicide hotline is ironic, since his life is falling apart, his business is about to be evicted, and he has no knack for speaking to people in person. His naive employee, played brilliantly by Rita Wilson, conceals her unrequited passion for Steve Martin and is optimistic to a fault. Mrs. Munchnik, the office pessimist, (played by the great, late Madelyn Kahn) tells Steve Martin disgustedly that her coworker ""could see the bright side of a plague.""

This is the first time I had seen Liev Schrieber in a movie, who, by the way, looks absolutely great in drag. Adam Sandler's ""I wonder"" tribute to Rita Wilson on the ukulele slays me each time I hear him abruptly stop at ""I love grape jelly,"" telling his audience that the song is a work in progress and that he had to quit his day job to write it. Mrs. Munchnik's droll sense of humor is clearly an extension of the late Norah Ephron's wit. I find myself repeating her philosophies such as ""men will have sex with a tree"" in my daily life. And the ever-present nemesis-- the Christmas fruitcake-- returns again and again to wreak havoc on the lives of all these poor unsuspecting slobs in subtly comedic ways.

There are so many other cast members to watch here. Several comedians are cameoed as callers to the hotline. I wish I could name them all.

This movie is unlike Norah's other more popular films, and I think it is underrated. I believe it is her most brilliant film. Unfortunately, you can't see it on most stations during the holidays, and it's not popular enough for streaming. I bought the DVD for a family member who loves Norah's films and other Christmas films but had never seen THIS one. I'm glad I did, because he loved it. It is well worth the very meager purchase price on Amazon to have it in your Christmas DVD library. Perhaps in twenty years time, it will be elevated to the status of Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life."" But for now, at least, you can get it here.

In the end, all the lonely weirdos are happily united or reunited (except for the Seaside Strangler who is dead.) Steve Martin succinctly sums up the movie in the final scene about what the true meaning of Christmas means to him. ""THIS is the miracle of Christmas."" THAT is that everyone in this world--no matter how quirky or idiosyncratic--deserves to love and to BE loved.",1395446400,,2965,4.5018587360594795
1649285,5,B00005QT9O,"I'm always on the lookout for a good Christmas movie and this is one. I think it's probably a sleeper because of the title. Nothing compelling about that title. In fact it's off-putting. They should have stuck with the original title of the French play it's based on which translates loosely as ""Santa Claus Is A Jerk."" But what I saw (this past Christmas, 2013, for the first time) was a great classic farce, in the manner of Feydeau: doors slamming, confused identities, people running around scantily clad, a cross dresser, an itchy fingered homicidal maniac, running gags, idiocy on the part of every one of the most absurd (but quite everyday, in my experience) kind. In short, a plot written so tightly that it can only be resolved on one way--but the audience can't guess what that resolution will be until it happens. All played by our best American farceurs, including Steve Martin (as the sane person!), Madeline Khan, Adam Sandler, Rob Reiner, Lieve Schreiber (in drag), Anthony LaPaglia (as Santa), and others.

1649295,3,B00005QT9O,"There's a lot to like about this movie- the cast, the plot, the jokes-  and Nora Ephron is a great story teller and director who has done a number of excellent comedies. Yet this film just doesn't quite work. A big problem, I think, is that it's not quite straight comedy, and not quite farce. There are a number of outrageous plot turns that the viewer might accept in a farce, but that are too jarring in this film. There are times when the pace of the plot picks up, and we start to venture into classic farce, but then the pace tapers off, and we're back in a drawing room comedy.

That's a pity, as there's a lot of good writing and a lot of talent here. It's a pity Ephron is no longer with us, as I would have loved to see redo this script into a classic stage farce, where it really would have shone.",1389312000,,808,4.1075949367088604

Mixed Nuts is a remake of that great film, only set in Southern California.  I knew I could never love this movie, because of the FAR SUPERIOR original, but I have to say I like it and would watch it again on occasion.  The reason why is for me to compare the scenes and realize what they are trying to California-ize.  I know that is not a word, but it is fun having an American take on the original, which is so French.  Still the American characters (even though I love Steve Martin) don't hold a candle to the actors from Le Splendid (they were an exceptionally creative network of friends and colleagues and all in the original movie).

 The first time we watched it I remember thinking: ""This is the stupidest movie we have gotten in a long time.  Who would be interested in all these neurotic people?""
  Then, suddenly, the action picked up and propelled this ensemble of disparate characters to a truly magical ending. Instead of growning stale, the jokes have mellowed and improved with age.  Many of the lines of this movie have come into our family lexicon and we love them because of what they can do for us in an unhappy moment.
This year, we could not find our own copy and thought that we were going to miss our Christmas Eve tradition.  This was  right when we had a new son-in-law to share it with.  Then my husband got the idea and seeing if you guys would stream it to us AND YOU DID !!!!

1649349,4,B00005QT9O,"Do a handful of laughs and the company of some funny people for a while make for a watchable film. On the whole, I thought so..since, whatever I may have paid, it was well below retail. (I  don't remember how much or I'd say). Steve Martin didn't have much to work with; aside from what were essentially television skits. There was little to be funny with. Kahn, similarly, had only a few funny moments; to get that much with the material given her shows her real talent. For the rest, they mostly did their bit and moved on.
With the foregoing in mind, how can I say that I derived modest pleasure from it: well, I don't understand it either. Why try to figure it out. You may hate it; and, I would say: understandable. You may love it; and, I would say: understandable. More than anything, I think, it depends on the time, place, companion(s) and mood ( of you and/or your companion(s)) when you see it. I don't think it will hold up if you watch it on Christmas Eve, sitting moody and alone, in front of your television set, with nothing to look forward to on Christmas Day but ham and eggs at Moe's Hash House.

But, I'd have to say Liev Schreiber steals the show in a dance routine that will stay in your mind, the next time you see him ""Wolverine"" or ""CSI"". He's NOT to be missed! This movie may remind you of fruitcakes of Christmas past, as well. If California could re-write ""It's A Wonderful Life"", this is as close as it would come without nonexistence of the main character.

 The movie screenplay is based on the French play turned film Le Pre Nol est une ordure (""Santa Claus is a bastard."") The movie feels like a Broadway play; it has one main set and two or three other sets designed to be Venice Beach CA, a perfect place for the plot and characters.
 Just like you wouldn't look to Christmas Story for academy award winning performances ... Mixed Nuts is simply fun and another great twist for a Christmas story and not an award-winning film with Oscar performances.
 It's light, witty and not predictable.  And, it's fun seeing Adam Sandler and his ukulele in his early years, Liev Schreiber (X-Men, Sabretooth/Victor Creed) as a transvestite, and of course John Stewart on roller skates!

1649357,1,B00005QT9O,"I don't know how you can have so many big name comedians in one film and somehow prevent anything from being even mildly funny.  How can you take Steve Martin, for example, and have him on film for an hour and a half without anything funny coming out of it?

They should have skipped the script and just had these comedians sitting on couches and see if anybody says anything funny - it would HAVE to be better than this movie.

If I had not been stuck in a hotel in China where this movie was the only thing on during a sleepless night on a hard matress, I would never have watched the whole thing.

An example of the type of humor is a transvestite man dancing with a straight guy - nothing of particular note, just the hope that somehow a transvestite all by itself is supposed to generate laughs.

Another example of the attempt at humor is a preganant woman accidently shoots a man in the head and kills him.  Oh well, no matter, her workmates wrap him up like a Christmas tree and carry him around town dancing and singing Christmas songs.  If that is the kind of stuff that makes you laugh, then this movie is for you.  If this is the kind of stuff that makes you laugh, I hope you are watching it inside of a supervised facililty.

The movie is complete with a pregnant woman having a baby in the city street complete with predictable huffing and puffing and screaming and swearing - ya, that is supposed to be funny too.

You get the idea - a low point in the career of a lot of big name comedians collected together in hopes that somehow the sheer names of the actors will overcome the ghastly script and sleepy directing.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work and we are reminded that script and plot and directing actually DO matter.",1301011200,,1739,4.33641975308642

And he was perfect as Chris.  Anthony LaPaglia was a baby in this movie-so young.  Madeline Kahn was as wonderfully zany as always - such a shame she was taken from this world at such a young age.

It was fun just picking out the big name stars - Jon Stewart, Rob Reiner, Joely Fisher.  And of course Steve Martin, Rita Wilson and Juliette Lewis were all perfect.  The only character I wasn't totally thrilled with was Louie, played by Adam Sandler.  I thought the character should have been there, just maybe a little less of him (the voice was grating).  Of course, Kahn's voice was, too, but it didn't bother me.

I find black comedies the best because its usually a twisted way of showing things as foes this movie during some parts. If you want a good movie to watch go get Shawshank Redemption, if you want to laugh every time you put this movie in buy this NOW. In my opinion this is one of Steve Martins best movies because it was new approach for his comic acting. I also like how Adam Sandler is in this, especially the fact that he acts as the person we all fell in love with, none of this current BS he does.

Not sure I would go so far as to call it the new ""Its A Wonderful LIfe"", but warm and amusing in a truly wacky sort of way.  Maybe part of the problem here is that it moves quickly, and with so many ""fruitcake"" characters, it requires a little more effort to ""get"" why it is amusing.  Maybe just a little too over the wacked.  But I don't really think so.  This is a gem worth watching for the cast and the music alone.  Especially when you can buy a secondhand copy for $5 or less.

There's cheer and blues, carolers and a tree-- of course 'oh tannenbaum' is none other than landlord STANLEY Tannenbaum (Shandling), recently deceased and now disguised with glued-on branches as a celebratory Yuletime pine!

Also here is the requisite re-gifted fruitcake, plus a cast of fruitcakes like no other! There's dog-hating widow Blanche Munchnik (Kahn), impromptu ukulele serenader Louie (Sandler), Mr. Lobel (Klein) and his pack of hounds, exotic baritone-voiced Chris (Schreiber) with her (his?) clingy black fishnet-trimmed evening dress, Santa-costumed Felix (De Paglia) the ex-con and his pregnant girlfriend Gracie (Lewis) --she's a real pistol!-- and of course the distinguished Dr. Kinsky (Reiner).

Heading up this cast of kooks is Philip (Martin), proprietor of Lifesavers, a crisis hotline phone center that'll be homeless once the old year is out. Philip doesn't have the 5K necessary to relocate, so it looks like he, Mrs. Munchnik and stressed-out Catherine (Wilson) will soon be unemployed. Nothing short of a second Christmas miracle can save the day... is there actually one to be had?

While unwrapping all the wacky festivities, do watch for several celebrity cameos. This underappreciated film really deserves a second look-- call it a re-gifting to yourself! Recommended for all.

With this in mind, ""Mixed Nuts"" is surprisingly bad. It's a farce without any good jokes, filled with characters that are annoying rather than funny. The Ephrones apparently find it hilarious when people sing with funny voices, and both Madeline Kahn and Adam Sandler embarrass themselves doing it in several scenes that completely fails to be funny. It's a shame a good cast was wasted on a script that should never have been greenlighted. Don't waste your money.",1230163200,,609,4.980392156862745

1649406,4,B00005QT9O,"Christmas is a time of goodwill, cheer and joy. Barring that, it can also be a time of random violence, phone perverts and flying fruitcakes.

Guess which kind of movie ""Mixed Nuts"" is.

And while the first half of the movie is a bit slow-moving, this mildly warped Steve Martin comedy tackles the ongoing woes of a bunch of lonely, rather crazy people thrown together on Christmas Eve. While it techically contains a heartwarming message, Nora and Delia Ephron prefer to focus on the increasingly frenetic characters and their escalating problems.

Philip (Martin) has just received an eviction notice for his suicide hotline, though he neglects to tell his coworkers, mousy Catherine (Rita Wilson) and sooty Mrs. Munchnik (Madeline Kahn). To make matters worse, Mrs. Munchnik gets stuck in the elevator, and Philip is unceremoniously dumped by his chilly fiancee.

As Philip tries to deal with his deteriorating life, the hotline receives some oddball Christmas guests -- insane pregnant Gracie (Juliette Lewis), depressed drag queen Chris (an unrecognizable Liev Schreiber), and some dork with a ukelele (Adam Sadler). And since Gracie gave Catherine a makeover, Philip is starting to see her with new eyes.

Unfortunately, Gracie has just dumped her penniless artist boyfriend Felix (Anthony LaPaglia) -- and he runs in with a gun. Several gunshots later, the ""mixed nuts"" find themselves in extremely deep trouble -- their shared Christmas present is a dead body.

""Mixed Nuts"" has two things I personally like: a warped holiday spirit, and a bunch of people as pathetic as I am. Admittedly the plot starts rather slowly, with amusing but not hugely funny jokes (including a Madeleine Kahn rapping a plea for help from a stalled elevator) and the impending destruction of the ""Lifesavers"" suicide line.

But after the cast is introduced to one another, the subplots and running jokes tighten into a solidly-written little whirlwind, where seemingly random elements turn out to important. And as if the plot weren't wonderfully frenetic enough, the Ephrons sprinkle in some running gags about a fruitcake, a dog-lover, a pair of vengeful rollerbladers, a phone pervert and a kelp-strewing serial killer who is a lot closer than anyone thinks.

And Delia and Nora Ephron do a good job weaving in some understated romances (including a rather sweet one between Chris and Ukelele Dork), and switching between heartwarming and mockery of the same (""There is hope in every pothole!""). And it has some truly awful songs from Ukelele Dork (""I like eating cheese, it taste very nice. Everyone likes cheese, especially white mice"").

Martin plays a surprisingly restrained role: a good-hearted but socially-inept man whose world is crashing around his ears. Rita Wilson is sweet as his kindly coworker, and Kahn is an absolute riot (""Men would have sex with a tree!""). Schreiber does a brilliant job balancing Chris' loneliness with some gutsplitting comedy -- especially when it's revealed that Chris has a VERY low pain threshold.

Additionally, LaPaglia and Lewis both do an excellent job as crazed soulmates who unfortunately have managed to procreate, and Rob Reiner has a fun cameo as a vet who is constantly called upon to minister to human animals. And Adam Sandler is... Adam Sandler. Interpret that as you will.

The title of ""Mixed Nuts"" pretty much tells you what the movie is about -- it's a Yuletide comedy that balances out heartwarming romance with warped, mildly sick comedy. Definitely a must-see.",1228867200,,3510,5.140350877192983

1649409,4,B00005QT9O,"Nora Ephron, the director of ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" brings us this zany Christmas comedy ""Mixed Nuts.""  It stars legendary comic man Steve Martin as the operator of a suicide prevention hotline, Lifesavers, in Venice Beach, California.  It is Christmas Eve and he has just received an eviction notice from his landlord; his girlfriend has also called to say that she has taken the advice of her psychiatrist and broken up with him.  Martin's co-workers include lonely Rita Wilson who fears she will spend the rest of her life always in the grocery store's Ten Items Or Less express lane and Madeline Kahn who keeps trying, but is constantly failing, to reach her dead husband's relatives whom she dislikes, and vice versa.

  An assortment of mixed nuts descends upon the hotline in search of companionship.  There is the transvestite, played surprisingly well by Liev Schreiber of ""Scream"" trilogy fame; he is surrounded by a large family but none of them understand him, proving that you don't have to be alone to feel lonely at Christmas.  His dance scenes with Martin are hilarious.  (Martin is a great dancer.)  Juliette Lewis (""National Lampoon's Family Christmas"") is a pregnant friend whose ex-con husband, Anthony LaPaglia, is a jobless loser dressed in a Santa Claus outfit; he keeps attempting suicide.  Rob Reiner is a harried veterinarian who treats LaPaglia for a cut on his forehead.  Adam Sandler is an imbecile who composes and sings silly songs while accompanying himself on his ukulele.  Meanwhile, there is a serial killer, the Seaside Strangler.  Could it be one of the strange assortment of odd characters?

  ""Mixed Nuts"" has a great cast of old pros and rising stars.  It has bizarre, morbid humor of the type found in the National Lampoon movies.  It teaches us that love and togetherness are very important to have on Christmas Eve.  No one, no matter how crazy they are, wants to be alone during the holidays.  ""Mixed Nuts"" is a great movie to get one in the mood for celebrating the holidays.  It has an upbeat ending that will warm your heart.",1226707200,,2073,4.8796561604584525

But when I truly allowed myself to sit back and watch it from beginning to end, I found myself enjoying it. Sure, the humor is corny in places and ""dark"" in others, but I think that overall it's a likeable little movie. Steve Martin is always fun to watch and this was no exception, but Liev Schreiber made this movie for me. His portrayal of confused transvestite Chris was hilarious, and the dancing scene was the best of the entire movie. He's a favorite of mine, and he really took this role and ran with it (from the make-up to the mannerisms, all while looking damn good in a dress). Everyone in this movie had their part, and I enjoyed them all, especially Rita Wilson, Adam Sandler, and Anthony LaPaglia. I only wish the omitted kissing scene between Liev and Adam Sandler had been left in; it would've made it all the funnier.

Now I'm adding this to my Must-Watch Christmas Comedies, alongside Christmas Vacation and The Ref. If you're in the mood for something silly but heartfelt at its core, give this movie a chance. You may be pleasantly surprised.",1190937600,,1164,4.542857142857143

1649440,5,B00005QT9O,"All of the cast has their own personality in the movie. No single actor outshines the other in the movie.

The movie takes place at a call center at a suicide hotline in Venice Beach, CA. Where they get true suicide callers as well as prank callers. All in the midst of being evicted from their business complext cuz rent is overdue. In addition, there's a seaside strangler on the loose like summer of sam. This movie is a whacked out dark comedy which is also intelligent comedy wise. This movie will probably not appeal to kids and young teens. This is more of an adult comedy but isn't racy or nasty like Bad Santa with Billy Bob Thorton.  This movie is funny from beginning to end. Like i said, all the actors have the ability to carry the movie. The movie is kina corny at the end. If u have the mind of an anal ""i hate my life and i blame it on everybody"" attitude or a critic's attitude than don't watch this movie. Theirs a great metaphor at the end of the movie. The movie deals with things like christmas becomes more lonely if u don't have a family, love interest, material things, a great job, having a chronic illness,etc. By not having the things u want during the christmas season it becomes a much lonelier place. I don't think a christmas movie has ever tackled this movie except Mixed Nuts. The ending has a great philosophical message. So this isn't some stupid meaningless holiday movie. People never talk about the negative side of christmas. Hello the highest percentage of suicide occurs during christmas time.  What about people who have no family members or a person dying of AIDS. It's just like some wannabe holiday like Valentine's Day. Valentine's Day makes u feel like crap if u don't have a love interest. That's America for you.

1649442,4,B00005QT9O,"MIXED NUTS is another of those movies I'm surprised that more people don't know about.  It's a complete joy, and such an antidote to other saccharine-sweet Christmas films.  Based on the French farce ""Le Pere Noel est une Ordure"", the story takes place on Christmas Eve in a suicide hotline call-office, in sunny California.  Philip (Steve Martin) and his devoted staff are about to be jobless and homeless as their office-block is being turned into luxury apartments, but the last night before Christmas turns out to be anything but routine...  It's hard to write a synopsis for this film, because the movie is really a series of comic routines and vignettes strung together through a loose narrative.

The film is filled with hilarious performances and some top-flight comedic talents like Madeline Kahn, Adam Sandler, Juliette Lewis and Liev Schreiber.  Probably the performer who comes off best is Kahn, playing the snide Mrs Blanche Munchnik (sadly one of the last films before her untimely death).  Her scene while trapped in the elevator is priceless.  Rita Wilson adds a charm and sincerity to her performance as Philip's shy would-be girlfriend Catherine and Liev Schreiber is hilarious as raving cross-dresser Chris.  With Rob Reiner, Anthony LaPaglia, Parker Posey, Garry Shandling and Joely Fisher.

I am genuinely surprised this film did not take off with audiences.  Most critics managed to click into the film's black comedy rhythm (and this was done by romantic comedy stalwarts Delia and Nora Ephron, in a deliberate departure from their regular fare).  This film is an absolute joy.  A must-watch at Christmastime, for sure!",1132358400,,1642,5.150943396226415

1649446,3,B00005QT9O,"I was on a comedy watching jag recently and this 1994 Nora Ephron effort (the follow-up to her critcal and commercial success SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE) was among the many that I finally got around to after all these years.  Now I read enough reviews to have at least an inkling as to how well received a given film was--even if it was released eons ago.  And I knew not to expect all that much from MIXED NUTS.  Still like so many of the films viewed in my ""comedy catch up"" splurge, it at least had a promising cast, and the writers and directors had a certain pedigree.  How bad could it be?

Well, while not an unmitigated disaster, MIXED NUTS certainly merited its mixed reviews.  Nearly all the actors have their moments to shine.  Unfortunately, they also have have downright embarrassing ones too. It's all a bit too loud, a bit too madcap for its own good.  The film's setting: a suicide hotline on Christmas Eve is promisingly dark.  Of course, you just knjow that the workers are going to be case studies themselves.  Everyone is, in fact, rather zany, with the possible exception of Rita Wilson's good hearted, but bumbling spinster who is just a bit more on the depressive  side.  But they all have issues.  And therein lies the comic potential.  If it's not quite the lunatics running the asylum, it's the neurotics running the hotline.  Give 'em credit for taking a few chances (Nora could have given us SLEEPLESS II, which essentially she did a few years later with YOU'VE GOT MAIL), but outrageousness for outrageousness' sake is always an iffy proposition.  And here it ultimately doesn't work.

A re-make of a French comedy (PERE NOEL EST UNE ORDURE), the film does seem to have something of a Gallic feel to it.  About as Gallic as it gets in Venice, California anyway.  And that may be part of the problem.  Remakes of French films don't usually work that well to begin with.  If the film's premise veers toward the absurd, Hollywood heavyhandedness can prove fatal.  That would seem to be the case here.

Overall, a sad waste of talent.",1119052800,,2053,4.610497237569061
1649447,1,B00005QT9O,"What makes one person laugh might make another cringe, so I can only offer my personal opinion on 'Mixed Nuts' and say that, personally, I found it one of the worst comedies ever made. The French original, 'La Pere Noel est une Ordure,' was not a great movie, but it did have some very funny gags and, amid moments of hysteria, had some beautifully underplayed comic moments. Unfortunately, this much lighter cover version is played at top volume and fever pitch almost from the start and is frequently just painful to watch. It boasts a talented cast (and Adam Sandler, here at his most irritating ever), the script isn't exactly terrible, but everyone seems to be overcompensating for the film's deficiencies so excessively that it is embarrassing to watch as Martin falls over for the umpteenth time for no good reason or Madeline Kahn hams it up to the point where you can feel the nausea rising in the back of your throat.

The two major offenders here are Nora Ephron's pitiful direction and George Fenton's horrendous score, a classic example of 'Mickey Mousing' the film to point out ""here come the jokes"" in the knowledge that you wouldn't notice them otherwise. Like too many of the players, they're both trying way, way too hard and clearly have no trust or confidence in their material.

For those familiar with 'Pere Noel,' the tone is lightened considerably - the dead body is no longer an innocent bystander but an unsympathetic character, and he no longer ends up fed to the zoo animals, for example. On the plus side, Juliette Lewis is nowhere near as bad as her French counterpart, Anthony La Paglia is okay, Rob Reiner very good in a nothing part and Liev Schrieber is good as long as he isn't required to do anything too ridiculous. But it's all too easy to believe the look of disgust on Martin's face near the end is real and only too clear that everyone involved knew that they were on a sinking ship with no lifeboats.",1112659200,,1942,4.642441860465116

Set at a Suicide Hotline service, the movie takes place on Christmas Eve, and we find that the counselors themselves may be just as ""depressed"" as the call-ins.  What makes this movie enjoyable are the performances of some of the cast members:  the late and great Madeleine Kahn is magnificent in a role that could only have been played by her.  Her attempts to get out of a stuck elevator are priceless, especially when she uses a Christmas toy to sing a rap song.  Kahn is priceless and we sorely miss her comedic genius.  Liev Schrieber takes the drag queen role to new heights with a sensitive and touching performance as a man who is lonely and in need of someone; Adam Sandler is comicly brilliant as the ukulele strumming minstrel who comes up with some pretty funny impromptu songs; Juliette Lewis and Rita Wilson are fine as the pregnant Gracie and the lovestruck Katherine.  Steve Martin, Anthony LaPaglia and Garry Shandling don't fare as well; Martin is too much ""Steve Martin"" and LaPaglia just seems miscast.

No matter how often I watch this, I love the musical intro to the film with all the scenes around Venice, with a bum wrapped up like a candy cane, an angelic girl's choir waiting on a bus bench, a skating snowman, and the bad-tempered roller bladers.  Madeline Kahn gets some of the greatest lines, rapping ""I'm stuck inna' elevator"" with a Christmas toy, trying to make enough racket so that someone will come to her rescue.  Once rescued, she races to the bathroom in urgent need, only to find that the self-indulgent and pregnant Juliette Lewis has locked herself in it.  Finally the girl opens the door and everyone topples in.  Madeline next turns up on the john, holding a bath towel as a privacy screen, as she shares her private moment with everyone else.
The world is a sadder place without Madeline Kahn in it.  She makes a sad, lonely and bitter woman lovable in the end.
Nora Ephron assembled a cast and characters that cannot exist in real life...except that I walked past a local shop of oddities and such, with the proprietress busy arranging a wide assortment of rummage, and I realized that it was the Juliette Lewis character come to life, even aged appropriately since the movie's date.

1649461,3,B00005QT9O,"Mixed Nuts is one of those movies that actually suffers from an all-star lineup. With a cast of unknowns or up-and-comers, it would shine as a fun little indie film. But with the comedic talents of Martin, Shandling, Kahn, Sanders, and others, you can't help but wonder why the movie isn't funnier. All complaints aside, it is a good film, as there are countless laughs throughout. But these moments are mostly due to the excellent performances by all (with Liev Schreiber stealing the show in what could have been a very cliche role), rather than the script itself, which seems to be uncomfortable with being a dark comedy, and continuously attempts to redeem itself with sappy couplings and a typical Kapra-esque happy ending. It may not make your list of Holiday Must-See films, but if you aren't expecting a miracle, you should come away happy.",1072224000,,848,4.855172413793103

That said, I have watched this film (on VHS) about eight (8) times. I have never tired of it. Now that it is available on DVD, I will be able to better enjoy this masterpiece of comedy. Each and every scene offers much to enjoy! The late Madeline Kahn almost steals the show with her wonderful performance. Liev Schrieber's performance was great! This is a comedy by which all others in its genre should be measured. The fact that this film did not see huge commercial success should indicate just how good it is.

All the characters are great in this film. I always enjoy Steve Martin, and he was quite amusing and clever in this movie. Rita Wilson (Tom Hank's real life wife) is quite delightful as Martin's lovely but underappreciated coworker (and potential love interest). The late Madeline Kahn is my particular favorite--she has the most sharp and clever sense of humor, and her talents are displayed well in this movie.
There are plenty of other future stars in this film (Adam Sandler, Jon Stewart, and so on) and they all do well in their parts.
The story goes awry during the last 20 minutes or so, so suspend your disbelief. It isn't supposed to make sense, or be realistic. (Or at least, it ought not be!) It's just a bizarre and funny movie. There's also lot of gallows humor here, so be warned, and just allow yourself to appreciate it!

1649476,3,B00005QT9O,"Although I own this disc and have enjoyed watching ""Mixed Nuts"" several times, I am still undecided as to whether the movie is really great or just a decent flick.  I lean towards the opinion that it's worth multiple viewings but it tries a little too hard to conjure up mountains of humor from molehill jokes.  Everyone loves to laugh at a poor tormented Santa Claus figure running through the streets to the music of the Platter's version of White Christmas, but there's a limit to everything.  Steve Martin is caught in a Chevy Chase sort of situation here.  You expect top quality, old Saturday Night Live class humor as in ""The Jerk,"" ""The Man With Two Brains,"" and ""Three Amigos,"" but the writers really kind of missed the boat and paid a top performer to star in a role that is not worthy of his talents.  But this all-star cast does deliver the goods and creates its fair share of chuckles, and the zany situations they are trapped in are really top-notch in creativity.  I just think it could have been developed a little better.  ""Mixed Nuts"" is a 5 star idea with 3 star writers.",1024012800,,1090,4.50253807106599

1649478,5,B00005QT9O,"This is my favorite Holiday movie.  From the first time I saw this dark comedy six years ago, I have enjoyed it year after year.  Nora Ephron did a wonderful job taking something as tragic as a Suicide Hotline on Christmas Eve and turning it into something funny.  Of course the subject of suicide itself is far from funny, and if you cant get past that, then you probably won't like this movie (although the movie doesnt dwell on that subject too much).
But this film keeps it light with lots of subplots, an outrageous cast including Steve Martin, Madeline Khan (who is hysterically convincing as the uptight Mrs. Munchnick), Adam Sandler, Rita Wilson (in her best performance to date), Tony LaPaglia, Liev Schreiber (very funny in drag), and others.
The music is very upbeat, the plot is fast-paced and there is a great blend of subtle humor (Khan insisting on increasing the suicide tote board by one number arguing that ""even though the person calling did not seem suicidal 'he or she may have become suicidal had they not called the hotline'"") and in-your-face humor (Martin dancing (against his will) with Schreiber-in-drag and ensuring that he keeps his body as far away from Schreibers as possible, that is, until he, Martin, realizes that he is actually enjoying himself).
The other great thing about this movie is that it can actually make the normal holiday blues seem not nearly as bad when you compare them to some of the problems that these characters encounter ........ and still they're able to find the true meaning of the holiday and have a happy Christmas.
Needless to say, I highly recommend this film.

1649479,5,B00005QT9O,"Let's face it, setting a comedy at a suicide prevention hotline center smacks of some truly tastless humor. However, black humor/farce doesn't bow to such societal pressure as ""inappropriate subject matter"". Clearly anyone who has felt the tragedy of suicide in their lives won't take to this one bit. However, that being said... ""Mixed Nuts"" is a TRULY hysterical film. Once again, the late MADELINE KAHN steals the show (like she did in ""What's Up Doc?""). It stars a name cast including Steve Martin, Juliette Lewis, Anthony Lapaglia, Adam Sandler, Rob Reiner and Garry Shandling. Rita Wilson is an actress I'm not familiar with but who did a great job here and the drag queen played by Liev Schrieber was awesome!
The hijinks revolve around a suicide prevention hotline (""Lifesavers""!) run by a not particularly stable crew. The center is in danger of bankruptcy and all are in fear of the ""seaside strangler"". Following around the Christmas fruitcake throughout the film is a wonderful plot devise. Seeing Madeline Kahn stuck in the elevator trying to rap on an electronic keyboard is one of the funniest moments I've ever seen on film. It was to the great discredit of the producers of a recent biography on her that this film wan't even mentioned.
There are many, many funny moments here and even the soundtrack is exceptional. The upbeat, funky ""White Christmas"" at the opening, with views of a sunny beach and a snowman made of sand set the tone for this wacky and delightful film. Eartha Kitt's ""Santa Baby"" is great as well. If your looking for an outrageous, truly hysterical comedy and don't have easily offended friends, then this movie will make you a hit this Christmas season!!!
(Mainstream critics hated it... so you know it MUST be good! It must have been ""incorrect"" to publicly admit to liking it!!!) My congratulations to Nora Ephron for making a comedy classic.
Enjoy... and don't forget to pass the fruitcake along!!!",1005868800,,1940,4.899696048632219
1649480,5,B00005QT9O,"There is no middle ground for this movie -- viewers either love it or hate it, and I LOVE it.  (In fact, it's a Christmas tradition for me and my friends.)  The characters are neurotic, absurd, silly, combustible, and the brisk comic timing is reminiscent of a theater piece.  It's a classic farce dissolving into a sentimentality that seems appropriate for the holiday season (no worse than ""It's a Wonderful Life"", for those who are jaded of such emotional manipulation).  Light-hearted and fluffy, Mixed Nuts is not intellectual...but it's eminently entertaining.  Its exoteric appeal allows intellectual people to have just as much fun as their non-intellectual friends and family as they watch it together.  Perfect.",1003017600,,721,5.226086956521739

Yes, they're a bunch of lovable losers, yes, I'm a sentimental slob, and no, I think the movie is an absolute winner.
Be warned: I think movies like ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Dracula: Dead & Loving It"" are funny.  I like Get Smart, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, etc etc.  I guess I'm just not reviewer material!
I think Madeline Kahn is brilliant in this; so is Adam Sandler (which is saying a lot; ... well, he's not actually brilliant, but he does a great ensemble job--I don't know how to describe it.  He contributes, okay?)  Everyone is at least competent.
The movie is far far greater than the sum of its parts.  To the director, I must say: wow.  You're good, kid.

I don't wait for Christmas to watch this movie, I get it out whenever I need a laugh.
Does anyone else find it frightening how exceptional Liev Schreiber is at acting like a woman? I mean, he's fantastic-much better than some other drag queens I've seen. And he dances so well with those stelletto's.
And let's not forget Madeline Kahn as Mrs. Munchnick. I love it when Steve Martin asks ""Chris"", ""have you seen a lady in a really bad mood?""
And Rita Wilson as the ever innocent yet seductive Katherine (or is it Catherine?)

What do you expect?
I'm not going to blow the storyline, because it's outragous and hilarious. It never looses momentum at all. Pure comic genius. In the end I feel like a light bulb, I'm just glowing. It's hilarous and at the end it touches a note, it hits and key and you go, ""Wow...how true."" Although it may get corny at times, who cares, it's a wonderful Christmas comedy that showcases some great comedic talent. Besides Sandler, Martin, Kahn and Klein it also has many other great actors, including Liev Schreiber in drag, Rita Wilson (who's a great actress and nobody knows her) as a depressed confused lonely woman, Juliette Lewis stark raving mad, Anthony LaPaglia playing dimwitted hopeless boyfriend of Lewis and supposively father of her baby, Garry Shandling as the landlord, Parker Posey and Jon Stewart as two outraged rollerbladers, Rob Reiner as neurotic but helpful vet, and Haley Joel Osment as a small child who says, ""Look mom, Santa!""
