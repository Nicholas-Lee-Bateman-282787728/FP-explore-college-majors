8392925,4,B003A95094,"I purchased this for my girlfriend who is an aspiring real estate investor. We like this series because it really shows the pitfalls and successes that new ""flippers"" go through. They also show whether or not the house sold and how long it was on the market; which is missing in almost all the other similar shows.

The downside is that sometimes the projects/investors/issues seemed staged. Some projects are going disastrously wrong then suddenly when it's time for the Open House everything has suddenly been resolved.

Either way, this series has been both entertaining and informative for me.",1389052800,,597,5.081632653061225
8392926,4,B003A95094,"To be honest, I love this show.  I think it gives a very honest look at the pitfalls and payoffs to flipping.  Some of the ""flippers"" do everything right, but end up getting hit with surprises such as a rotting roof or floor boards that put a hole in the budget they weren't ready for.  Others just do everything wrong from start to finish.

I have a number of friends that want to get into this business from the thought of making $100,000 for a couple months work a year and I always highly recommend watching this show first.  There's just so much good advice.  For example, do NOT build YOUR dream house.  This is not your house, its your flip.  Also, if you want contractor work to get done, be at the work site.

The only frustrating part is when the laziest, worst people make a huge payout.  I won't spoil who it is, but this IS a reality show, and the reality, sometimes the lazy people do come out on top.",1387324800,,915,4.236994219653179
