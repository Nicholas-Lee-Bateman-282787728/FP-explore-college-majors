8106545,1,B000E6FVW2,We just ordered the wrong item. My husband wanted a DVD with Tal playing jazz guitar. I had to return it.,1467417600,,105,4.0476190476190474
8106546,3,B000E6FVW2,i agree with most of the reviews on here.  Its a great video but its more centered around him and not his teaching or his technique...  might go for a joe pass video or something instead.  Still one of my favorite guitar players of all time.,1368489600,,241,4.195652173913044
8106547,5,B000E6FVW2,Not only do you get to watch Tal Farlow play guitfiddle but he gives you a private lesson and talks about his life!!! How does he know all that stuff?! I rented this from Netflix and I reported it lost. It' s mine they are not getting it back.,1300492800,,243,3.979591836734694
