Years later I got a Connoisseur Video Collection VHS copy of the film. It was slightly better in visual quality but it still suffered from subtitles that were incomplete as well as hard to read. That issue as well as the picture quality has been more than corrected in this new Olive Films Blu-Ray release. However I was greatly surprised to see that the ending of the film had been changed from the version I first saw and purchased. In the original version the principal character, Jean Diaz, comes to a very different end which is far more cynical and allows him the opportunity to utter the film's title J'ACCUSE (I Accuse). This new version removes that scene which lasts about 4 minutes with a shorter, more optimistic ending where war is completely abolished. I have read where director Abel Gance kept tinkering with the film for years and this ending seems to be a product of that tinkering. It still doesn't rob the movie of its visceral power and although heavy handed in places and burdened with a romantic subplot typical of the time in which it was made, J'ACCUSE should be mandatory viewing in any serious film class as well as for anyone interested in European cinema.

Gance first made this material as a silent film back in 1919 which has also been restored and released on home video. That version is longer and more focused on other characters and the climactic ending where the War dead return to life is not nearly as startling or horrific as it is here in the 1938 remake. For those of you unfamiliar with the movie (and there are far too many of you) the story follows the life of Jean Diaz a poet and teacher who fights in the First World War and is brutalized by its horrors. He resolves to bring about an end to war by devoting himself to creating technology that will end war. Of course his inventions are subverted by the powers that be and as the world prepares for the next global war (WW II which was a year away), he passionately summons the World War I dead to rise from their graves to stop the coming conflagration. This hallucinatory zombie sequence, years ahead of its time, once seen cannot be forgotten. Many thanks to Olive Films for making a quality copy of this masterpiece available. It's just too bad they couldn't have had the original ending. The use of stock footage has not been speed corrected which would have been nice but that would have made the restoration a lot harder and a lot more expensive.",1481500800,10,2569,4.524731182795699

As I recall, this movie was made in 1939 just before the beginning of WWII.  If people had only taken the warning in this film seriously---there might never have been a WWII!  At least Mr. Gance made a valiant effort to warn everybody!  But, for us, maybe he's still warning us...about the NEXT war!  The scene that sticks with you indelibly in your mind  is when....(don't read this if you already intend to buy a copy....).........is when the dead soldiers from the previous war,  WWI, arise from their graves en mass....marching, marching by the hundreds and thousands----30,40, 50 abreast----- onward and onward to ""give a warning"" to try to ""give a warning"" to mankind now living  to stop another carnage...to stop another useless slaughter.....to stop another war.  That scene of the ""dead soldiers coming out of their graves and marching to give warning to mankind""  will stay indelibly in your mind forever!  Try to see this movie if you can.  I have seen it for rent at online mailorder movie rental places which specialize in older films.  (Another anti-war ""messenger"" was the songwriter and folk singer, Phil Ochs..and his wonderful song  ""I ain't a marchin' anymore""---get that on CD if you can find it.)

7851056,5,6303593453,"Before Orson Welles, Fritz Lang and Buuel...there was Abel Gance! Before Dr. King, Mandela, Gandy, Solyentizin, Romero or Manch...there was Gance. If you really love good movies this is a must in your very private collection; the ""kind of"" you will see again and again, the ""kind of"" make you think a lot. Abel Gance took the post from Erich Remarque and Henry Dunnant and very well ahead of his time spoke his mind asserting that in wars eventually, even weapons makers and weapons traders, bloodthirsty beligerant people LOST! Gance was not only clever but brave to make this beauty...the interesting thing is that even when the firs version was lost, Gance start working and made it again. Is a legacy for those who don't belive war has ever solve the problems of the world. A real masterpice from a time when special effects were in diappers. Bertollucci, Lean, Costa Gavras and Orson Wells himself acclaimed this movie. Get it you will not regret.",1031788800,10,952,4.810975609756097
