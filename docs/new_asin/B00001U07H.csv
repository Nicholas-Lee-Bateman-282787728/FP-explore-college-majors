He had tried for years to locate it for his friend ""Buzzy"" (Burgess Meredith, who directed and acted in it)but was never able to find it for him during his lifetime.  Both he and Charles Laughton felt it was their most enjoyable experience in working on a film.

1246230,3,B00001U07H,"The Man on the Eiffel Tower, 1950 film

This film takes place in Paris France. It shows a man wearing an overcoat and walking under the Eiffel Tower, then in an alley. Another man enters a restaurant to see his wife Ellen Kirby and Edna Warren. He makes a comment about getting rid of his rich aunt. Who is listening? Ellen discusses their status with Bill, and leaves. Who wrote that note? A man enters a dark house and sneaks into a room. The light shows red blood. Another man enters with rags on his shoes (padded feet) and breaks the eyeglasses of the first man. ""I can't see!"" A man outside offers help. The newspapers tell of two murders. [English is a French newspaper?] Edna meets Bill, who speaks of caution. Inspector Maigret of the Police Judiciare is on the case. Edna and Bill Kirby are questioned about the murder of his rich aunt. Joseph the knife sharpener walks to work, he lost his glasses. Maigret arrests him for the murder. He admits to burglary, but can't tell who brought him
 home.

A message is smuggled in to tell of an escape. But the police are watching! [I didn't recognize the building.] He goes to an apartment but is watched by the police. Joseph has a temper! He flees. A newspaper reports this news. The letter is analyzed by a graphologist. ""Le Deux Magots"" seems to be a literary caf. Joseph Heurtin sits outside. A customer inside speaks loud and attracts attention; he can't pay for his order. We learn his background: smart but poor. Manic-depressive? [Followed too closely?] A chase over the rooftops. Heurtin goes to an apartment and finds Radek. Maigret visits Bill Kirby at a hotel and gets the serial numbers of his money. Then he visits Radek and they go to the Eiffel Tower restaurant. Radek talks about power. [Manic?] Radek calls Kirby with a warning. [Or a trap?] Maigret visits the murder house and finds Bill Kirby, who is not well. Kirby scratches the initial ""MV"" in the dust.

The search for Elizabeth Radek leads to Joseph Heurtin! Maigret talks to Radek, who acts superior in saying Maigret hasn't found Heurtin. Radek posts two letters. The one to Ellen tells about the hidden knife. EdnaWarren gets a letter also. Radek throws his money to the young women in the parlor. The police see Edna going to that St. Cloud house, then Mrs. Kirby arrives. Only Edna leaves. Maigret and Radek converse. Is there another body in the house? There is a big surprise in that house! What do they find in that closet? Will Maigret reveal the trick? Will there be a car chase for action? They arrive at the Eiffel Tower where the chase continues. Later, Radek says ""you won't follow me now, Maigret."" Maigret leaves before the clang from a machine. Heurtin's life seems to be better.

This movie was adapted from ""A Battle of Nerves"" by Georges Simenon. The screenplay was by Harry Brown, who wrote ""A Walk in the Sun"" and the script for ""The Sands of Iwo Jimo"". The producer was Irving Allen. [I don't know how this compares to the other Maigret stories.] This is about an average movie, but some scenes seem to have been omitted. It shows Paris in the late 1940s. Years later Burgess Meredith repeated his performance in a TV drama where a book lover accidentally smashed his glasses and could not get them repaired. You can compare this story to the more famous ""The Third Man"", which also takes place in a foreign capital.",1294099200,,3368,4.597337770382696
1246231,1,B00001U07H,"I've always loved ""Man on the Eiffel Tower."" It's got a great cast with Charles Laughton, Burgess Meredith and Franchot Tone in the lead roles. It's also Burgess Meredith's only directorial effort, and good one at that. I'm not writing specifically about the movie, which is a wonderful thriller. But the print being offered is unwatchable. It's blurry and it skips. We can only wait for the day when a decent copy becomes available.",1268092800,6,433,4.864864864864865
1246232,4,B00001U07H,"This movie is about the cop, the Paris intellectual, the guy who hires the murder of his rich aunt and the patsy. The inspector is always a step behind, playing catch up, but soon the intellectual makes a misstep.
A very goods classic early color movie that shows Paris as it was in the late 40's.",1233964800,,297,4.321428571428571
1246233,3,B00001U07H,"This movie's okay. Adapted from Georges Simenon's 1931 novel L'HOMME DE LA TOUR EIFFEL (a.k.a. A BATTLE OF NERVES), THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER is a 1949 would-be psychological thriller and police procedural which has some bits of merit but mostly chugs along at its own tedious pace. Hence, the mood evoked isn't as much atmospheric as it is muddled, and it felt like a gang of birthdays had elapsed before I got thru watching this one. Not even the curious excesses of Charles Laughton could hike up my interest level.

If there's one thing this movie taught me, it's to never trust a man who consumes caviar sandwiches and vodka. That's just weird. When a shiftless playboy, having a nice tryst in a crowded cafe with both his wife and his mistress, casually remarks that he'd give a million francs to have his filthy-rich aunt murdered, someone overhears and takes him up on the offer. Now, in the wake of the murders of two women (I guess the maid was a freebie), a meek knife-sharpener becomes implicated, and, later, the playboy, as well. In steps Inspector Jules Maigret, embodied to sluggish, mannered effect by Laughton. And the cat & mouse games begin, between him and the clever murderer, who thinks himself untouchable. As Maigret eventually asks the killer: ""Am I following you or are you following me?""

Inspector Jules Maigret has had a bounty of television appearances, spanning decades and featuring various actors taking on the role. Apparently, Maigret has also had some good success in cinema, worldwide. But you couldn't tell it by THE MAN ON THE EIFFEL TOWER, which is forgettable. Although it contains elements of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strangers-on-a-Train-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0002HOERG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strangers on a Train (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, this film isn't as good. And, make no mistake, it's not Alfred Hitchcock at the helm of this one.

Two of the three principals muck it up. Charles Laughton makes for a dull Maigret, who, as written by Simenon, is somewhat of a plodding, procedural character anyway. Burgess Meredith has also been in better form. Here, I couldn't find it in me to feel anything other than exasperation for his timid, bossed-around, often manipulated character. By the way, according to the dvd jacket, producer Irving Allen originally was the film's director but that Charles Laughton so didn't dig his work that he threatened to walk out unless Burgess Meredith take over directing. So the final product credits Meredith with his first and only directing gig. The job that he does demonstrates why in his career he's only directed one movie.

Not too many things enliven this film. There's the tourist-friendly Paris cityscape, of course, which is showcased relentlessly throughout the film, and markedly thru several chase scenes (The pursuit up the Eiffel Tower happens to be riveting stuff). The film wasn't kidding when it listed the City of Lights as a supporting character in the opening credits. I quite liked Franchot Tone's bravado as he baits the chubby Police Inspector. The best scenes, in fact, happen when Laughton and Tone interact, and credit mostly goes to Tone's disturbed idiosyncracies for keeping it interesting. And - we're really digging into the sofa's recesses now - it's also demonstrated how descending in an elevator can count as a victory of sorts.

This film, originally shot with the Ansco Reversal process and restored by the UCLA Film & Television Archive, does come in muted colors, but mostly dominated by sepia tones. There are still brief scratches on the print, and the initial leg of the car chase near the end is lighted so dimly I couldn't make out much of anything. Other than that, I really have no complaints about how the film looks. Believe me, I've seen a prior dvd version of this film, and that print was quite horrible.

See this for Franchot Tone's bent performance and, of course, for the City of Lights. Try not to focus on how badly you want to slap around that aggravating knife sharpener, because that's mean.",1226793600,4,4102,5.105812220566319
1246234,1,B00001U07H,"Stay far, far away from this horrible transfer to dvd.  EIFFEL TOWER is one of those glorious thrillers directed by Burgess Meredith that needs an updated transfer.  This dvd simply sucks.  If you have memories of the original--skip this version.  It seems to be either a transfer from a bad old vhs or one of the earlier cable channels. Don't bite.  Keep your memories of the original and wait for someone to fully appreciate how fine this thriller was and is.  I find it odd that amazon even allowed this version to find its way into customer hands.  Boo Hiss.  The tendency is to go with versions of these old films/public domain--that are more expensive than the cheepies.  Not knowing what these other versions look like--DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION.  Remember JUNGLE BOOK?  One of the better versions was a steal at $7.95.  Meaning--you take your chances.",1208217600,5,857,4.755102040816326
1246235,2,B00001U07H,"""The Man on the Eiffel Tower"", one of two films directed by superb actor Burgess Meredith who also starred in it, considering the accomplished cast was a colossal failure.  Not only was the film transfer awful, but the sophomoric, disjointed plot was only saved by the footage shot around Paris.

Impatient heir Bill Kirby played by Robert Hutton wishes his rich aunt dead so he can inherit the funds to dump his wife to be with his mistress.  His conversation is overheard by ham actor Franchot Tone playing boisterous, psychopathic and penniless medical student Johann Radek.  Tone conspires to murder the aunt and poor knife grinder Joseph Heurtin who is also a part time bungling burglar stumbles into the murder scene and gets implicated.

The esteemed Charles Laughton's talents are wasted in his role as police Inspector Maigret who is taunted by Tone as he conducts his investigation into the murder.  The tepid drama concludes with a chase scene on the steel girders of the Eiffel Tower, which was the highlight of a mostly poor effort.",1167091200,,1045,4.909090909090909

As for the DVD, I read the review on it, & it appears this title needs a reissue by someone with a mint copy from the Studio. My $6 copy was from Alpha Video Distributorsin NJ.

1246237,4,B00001U07H,"Burgess Meredith, of all people, directed this oddball thriller, which features Franchot Tone as an ice-cool (but quite deranged) criminal mastermind who secretly yearns to be caught, and taunts a Parisian detective, Inspector Maigret (Charles Laughton) into hounding him. The moodiness of the film's beginning is undercut by the implausibility and uneven direction of the cat-and-mouse machinations of the second half; Laughton's character loses steam and while Tone delivers some choice moments eye-bulging insanity, it's had to make heads or tails out of his overly-explicit taunts of Maigret's faltering investigation. Sort of a lesser version of ""The Third Man,"" with a resplendid mid-century Paris in place of a war-torn Vienna. Nice look at the inner workings of the Eiffel Tower as well... An interesting early adaptation of mystery novelist George Simenon's Maigret character, but ultimately a fairly shaky film.",1054166400,3,921,5.633093525179856
1246238,4,B00001U07H,"Simenon's seminal sleuth, Maigret, was never better enacted than by the shrewd, slow and sure Charles Laughton who is after a thrill-killer-for-hire Franchot Tone. Tone's portrait of a psychopathic murderer, who enjoys killing because it feeds his warped ego is fascinating.  When the nephew of a rich woman hires Tone to kill his aunt and Laughton investigates. A very clever game of cat-and-mouse ensues.  The acting is truly outstanding in this film: Tone actually and triumphantly overcomes Laughton's masterful mannerisms in their scenes together.  The viewer is treated to a majestic Paris while we slowly engage in  the thrilling story and the superb chase on the Eiffel Tower is uniquely exciting.  Burgess Merideth (!) was the director, and he did an admirable job.  The music score by Michel Michelet is exeptional.",1036972800,8,825,5.259541984732825

7914742,4,B00001U07H,"This is a little gem of a movie. I had not heard of it until quite recently. Produced by Irving Allen, who started off as director as well, but was replaced by Burgess Meredith at Charles Laughton's insistence, according to the story.
Based on Georges Simenon's Inspector Maigret novel ""La Tte d'un homme"" (which has been translated into English under the titles of  ""A Battle of Nerves"", and ""A Man's Head."" The movie was also the first American movie to be shot in color in Paris. ""The City of Paris"" in fact, receives fifth billing in the opening credits.
Laughton is wonderful as Inspector Maigret. After viewing the movie I had two regrets: that he only played the role once, and that the copy of the movie I was watching was in such terrible condition. This is not a restored version of the movie. The whole film is slightly blurry, there are multiple scratches and dots running through the film, the music track is distorted and often too loud, and the vocal track has a couple of moments that are garbled. And there are a few odd cuts indicating that a line or even partial scene is missing.
That being said, if you can sit through a far-less-than-decent-condition movie, this one is great for fans of Laughton, Meredith, Tone as well as of Inspector Maigret.",1426464000,,1267,4.631111111111111
