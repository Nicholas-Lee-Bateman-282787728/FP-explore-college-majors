6 one-sided discs with 4 movies a piece. Some of the transfers are not the best, but these are older movies. No special features and while some seem to have subtitles, none appear on the screen so far. All the movies seem to be between 1 and 2.5 hrs long so far but there's no booklet or insert with lengths or movie descriptions.",1409443200,,1348,5.299065420560748
8340696,2,B001T75S5A,"2 stars for a 5 star collection for one important reason.

the back of the box claims ""fully restored & enhanced digital masters"".

what they mean is some of these movies look like they were downloaded from youtube & put on a dvd... i had to keep my glasses off just so the quality of the video didn't make me want to break my only copy of bmx bandits.

they put 24 movies on 6 single-sided discs... i'm not sure these are even dual layered discs... i haven't popped them into the computer yet.

if you're only going to watch these movies once and then give the set away... this is a great investment... there's some serious cheese inside of this box.",1309132800,,651,4.311475409836065
