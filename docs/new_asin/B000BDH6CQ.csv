2414549,3,B000BDH6CQ,"I'm not one to fall all over A productions at the expense of B films. Too many of the latter type are more entertaining and this film is a good example. The script unfolds in an entertaining, no-frills manner but is significantly heightened by the quirky characters. Sean McClory definitely stands out but check out that slob of a ship's captain. You don't really know what to make of the characters. Plunder is not overlong and has great location scenery. Glenn Ford's movies are among my all-time favorites especially his Columbia films and this WB movie is no exception to an entertaining output. One reviewer compared his niche at this time to Robert Mitchum's. I totally agree and this movie could easily have been a Mitchum/RKO film.

I wish more of Glenn Ford's films were avialable on dvd. Check this title out for a fun popcorn viewing at the movies.",1176508800,4,859,4.726666666666667
2414550,4,B000BDH6CQ,"While much of Glenn Ford's early 1950s film output are unabashedly 'B' movies (he filled the same niche as Robert Mitchum did, at RKO), his movies are, by and large, very entertaining, and ""Plunder of the Sun"", shot in Mexico for Warners and John Wayne's Batjac Productions, is no exception. Directed by John Farrow, this action drama offers noir elements (an ambiguous hero, a 'fallen' woman, brutal violence, and an 'expressionist' use of light and shadow), John Huston-like characters (reminiscent of both ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Treasure of Sierra Madre""), and an actually pretty accurate look at ancient Indian civilizations that built cities with pyramids when Europe consisted of little more than tribes.

Ford is Al Colby, a down-on-his-luck American recruited by rotund Thomas Berrien (Sidney Greenstreet-channeling Francis L. Sullivan) to slip a package through Mexican customs. When Berrien unexpectedly dies, a variety of characters offers Colby money, potential treasure, or his life, in exchange for the mysterious package, which he discovers contains part of an ancient document mapping where a hidden cache of priceless artifacts is buried. Seduced by both beautiful native girl Patricia Medina, who seems involved with all the 'major players', and drunken American 'party girl' Diana Lynn (doing a 'Gloria Grahame' impression), and 'educated' through beatings and genial lectures by the mysterious 'Jefferson' (scene-stealing Sean McClory), Colby teeters between succumbing to the vast wealth the document promises, and 'doing the right thing', and turning everything over to the Mexican authorities, who legally 'own' the artifacts. While Ford's portrayal lacks the subtle shadings of Bogart or Mitchum, he handles the moral dilemma quite well, and he certainly can take a beating!

With much of the action filmed at actual Aztec sites, in Oaxaca, Mexico, the film has an authentic 'feel', is fast-paced, and very watchable.

Certainly worth a look!",1160265600,7,1969,5.513245033112582
2414551,4,B000BDH6CQ,"The late Glenn Ford was known for his stand up roles (Cowboy, Pocketful of Miracles) in most of his films. Here he plays against hero type...a down on his luck guy  asked to carry a package (ala Bogie in Falcon) from Havana to Mexico on a ship. He meets characters similar to Bogie's Falcon (A fat man, a lorre wantabee in dark glass and two Fem Fetales). It ends in mexican ruins and Ford shines better then this script. John Farrow (mia's dad) direct this fairly, mostly in angles and over staging the scenes.

2414552,3,B000BDH6CQ,Just fair movie as a suspense goes but interesting on-site filming in Mexico.  The caracters were interesting but the story never delivered the suspense needed.,1153872000,2,160,5.4
2414553,3,B000BDH6CQ,"Plunder of the Sun is more upmarket and more successful than most of Batjac's non-John Wayne starring pictures, with broke insurance adjuster Glenn Ford finding himself in Maltese Falcon territory when Francis L. Sullivan's fat man asks him to smuggle some pages of a Zatopec manuscript out of Cuba. Naturally it all leads to multiple murders and a scavenger hunt in the spectacular ancient cities of Mitla and Monte Alban with Sean McClory's bleach-blonde thug, Patricia Medina's compulsive liar and Diane Lynn's Gloria Graham impersonator among the various interested parties trying to do him out of his share.

No classic, but a slick disposable entertainment, and well presented in Paramount's DVD. The extras aren't quite as comprehensive as they seem, with most dealing with the locations, but it's a good package.",1152144000,3,820,5.259541984732825
2414554,5,B000BDH6CQ,"PLUNDER OF THE SUN plays much like a movie from the film noir genre with its somber tone and cynical mood. Glenn Ford certainly typifies the film noir hero as Al Colby a disillusioned loner who becomes involved in what appears to be some shady dealings with several mysterious characters and a mysterious package from Havana to Mexico. Glenn Ford plays this character with a gritty realism. During the first third of the film Ford is seen down and out living in a world comprised of stark undercurrents. Director John Farrow however films the rest of the tale in vivid daylight once it shifts from Havana to the bright decks aboard ship en route to sunny Mexico. Yet, Farrow uses vivid light in lieu of dark shadows to create this film noir vision in broad daylight. Essentially this could have been a standard murder adventure mystery but Farrow's approach gives this film a jagged realism with imperfect and vulnerable characters.  Farrow's approach raises questions of morality. Is hero Glenn Ford really involved in stealing Mexican artifacts for his own monetary gain at the expense of Mexico's cultural and historical heritage? Ford's fatalistic approach to his character adds to the noir and mystery of this film. Sean McClory gives a brilliant and appealing performance as Jefferson, an enigmatic scoundrel with a bleach blonde crew cut to boot that tries to steal Ford's secret parcel throughout the film. Diana Lynn also gives a very credible performance as a woman of dubious character exuding unrefined sensuality that also vies for Ford's parcel. Jonathan Latimer's script, based on the novel by David Dodge, and director Farrow's vision greatly realized by Jack Draper's brilliant cinematography lends to the notion that the characters are dealing with something of greater importance than all their efforts to outmaneuver each other. Composer Antonio Diaz Conde's score is colorful capturing the flavor of the Mexican locale and wonderfully compliments the idea that the plundering the historical treasures may certainly be sacrilegious and detrimental to those who attempt such transgressions. This film is certainly a lost gem exemplifying the cohesive art of solid filmmaking.",1152057600,12,2194,5.215297450424929
2414555,4,B000BDH6CQ,"Within the past year, the old fifties ""hard-boiled"" noir adventure thriller ""Plunder of the Sun"" has resurfaced in both of it's media incarnations. The original David Dodge novel has been reprinted and re-issued by the folks at ""Hard-Case Crime"" and can be gotten through your local literary outlets. ""Hard-Case Crime"" specializes in bringing back bad-guys-vs-sorta-good- guys-and-maybe good/maybe-bad-gals kinds of stuff...with not a

PROFILER or SERIAL KILLER in SIGHT....a fresh breeze from what normally haunts the paperback racks in the early 21st century...

and they think ""Plunder"" is worth a read. So do I.

""Plunder"" is ALSO back in cinema format in the Wayne-Fellows (later BATJAC) production starring Glenn Ford, Patricia Medina, and Sean McClory. It is shot in glorious, moody, atmospheric black and white, excellently acted, and well directed by John Farrow. This film was one of two shot in Mexico in the same year

by Wayne-Fellows/BATJAC, both directed by Farrow. The other film was the 3-D Technicolor western classic ""HONDO"".

The intellectually challenged ""video-game-as-movie"" fanatics will not care one wit for ""Plunder of the Sun"" . This isn't ""Stealth"" or ""Tomb Raider"" or any such ""kaboom-kaboom-bam-bam"" CGI-propelled FX showcase. This is a STORY, with DIALOG, and with PLOT intricacies and double crosses, and you actually have to use your BRAIN to follow it. No multi-car chases/crashes and only a very FEW gunshots fired!!! And, wonder of wonders!, when a fight occurs its just a good old fashioned fisticuffs kind of fight!!!! Wow! Shazam!!! Nobody is leaping around twenty feet in the air doing somersaults or catching bullets in their bare hands.

American insurance investigator Al Colby is roped into a scheme involving Mexican archaeological treasures in a story that is told in narrative flashback. He starts out in pre-Castroite Cuba and ends up in Mexico in a maze of double-dealing and double trouble. Figuring out who is doing what to who... and why...is part of the fun in trying to unravel this ""chinese box"" of a mystery. The old saying ""Trust No One"" is very apropos here.

GOT to be dull as dirt, right? Well, if the CGI Wham-Bam is your personal cup of tea, yeah, it WILL be dull as dirt. But if you like noir-syle action of a more realistic nature , then you might well enjoy this. It isn't GREAT . It isn't ""The Maltese Falcon"" ,though the Francis L. Sullivan character, Barrien, comes very close (perhaps as a good-humoured ""homage"") to a Sydney Greenstreet ""type"" here. Having said that, though, I must add that ""Plunder"" IS entertaining...even WITHOUT explosions,

60-car accidents, or profilers and serial murderers (remarkable!). All you get here are REGULAR old mean-spirited, ruthless, GREED-oriented murderers...if you can STAND such a hackneyed old concept in the ""Day of the Genius Uber-Psycho"".

There are great location sequences here shot in Zapotec ruins in the Oaxaca Valley and these sequences add very credible authenticity to the overall feel of the film. The DVD package also adds some excellent special features on the Zapotec civilization and on the illegal theft and black-marketing of archaeological artifacts (which is, of course, the subject of the movie)

All in all this is a pretty nifty little ""unknown"" (or ""little known"")suspense piece from the BATJAC vaults",1150070400,20,3337,5.208955223880597

Directed by John Farrow

Several interested parties converge upon the Mexican Aztec ruins in search of a long-buried treasure. Insurance investigator Al Colby (Glenn Ford) is ostensibly the hero, but he doesn't seem any more trustworthy than the rest of the petty crooks, fallen women and alcoholics who've gone along for the archaeological ride. Pretty soon the treasure hunters have fallen out and murder is committed

Adapted from a novel by David Dodge

The script plays fast and loose with the novel, changing the locale from Peru to Mexico and now the search is on for Aztec artifacts instead of Incan. All things considered, this is a tightly directed and well acted tale.

Ford's strong characterization provides enough impetus to carry the film along; the writers apparently saw ""Gilda"" and decided that Glenn Ford would be even more popular if he was a complete misogynist. There are some really fun lines of dialog that he throws out there in his cynical way. McClory was also very impressive in a menacing character role. There are numerous small character parts that are all handled with great consistency by director Farrow.

The B&W cinematography is quite good, with its dark shadows and strange camera angles. It's almost ""noirish"". Filmed on location in Mexico, the outdoor visuals convey a sense of grand scope and historical authenticity.

2414565,4,B000BDH6CQ,"One of the more ambitious titles from John Wayne's Batjac production company, PLUNDER OF THE SUN (based on the book by David Dodge) stars Glenn Ford as an average joe who becomes the target for a deadly game of cat-and-mouse when he agrees to take a mysterious parcel over the Mexican border.

Al Corby (Glenn Ford), broke and stranded in Havana, is offered $1,000 to transport a small package from Havana to Mexico.  He quickly agrees but soon regrets his rash decision when he's later keenly chased by a bleach-blonde assassin (Sean McClory), an alcoholic basketcase (Diana Lynn) and a Mexican spitfire (Patricia Medina).  Who can he trust...and who is the enemy?  The red herrings fly thick and fast in this well-paced adventure story, filmed on location at the spectacular ruins of Mitla and Monte Alban in Oaxaca Mexico.

This movie also has something serious to say about the criminal practice of looting and profiting from ancient treasures.  Most of the characters within PLUNDER OF THE SUN are involved in the illegal trafficking of artifacts.  The whole cast is very impressive, especially Diana Lynn as a bitter harpy, and Glenn Ford as the ""hero"", who colours his performance in various shades of gray.  Patricia Medina is luminous as Anna Luz, and Sean McClory (a regular Batjac player) is outstanding as the mysterious Jefferson.

The DVD has some fascinating background material on the locations used in the movie, a featurette on the career of Sean McClory, rare home movies of Glenn Ford on location, plus a commentary track with Peter Ford (Glenn's son) and Frank Thompson.
