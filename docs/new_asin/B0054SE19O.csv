4570780,1,B0054SE19O,"William Monahan is best known as the screenwriter for a few big movies, including Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven and Body of Lies, and Martin Scorsese's The Departed, for which Monahan won a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar. For London Boulevard, Monahan not only adapted the Ken Bruen novel of the same name, but also made his directorial debut, and unfortunately, it wasn't exactly an auspicious one. The film stars Colin Farrell as Mitchell, an ex-con trying to go straight who is hired by a reclusive starlet to be her bodyguard; when they cross paths with a notorious mob boss, Mitchell is sucked back into the London underworld against his will. Unfortunately, while I felt the film was adequately stylish and chock full of meaty dialogue, I also felt that there were far too many subplots to follow and that the emphasis on style detracted from the film's overall quality. You'll probably only get a kick out of London Boulevard if you like the stars, or if you're looking for tips on how to speak Cockney.",1329782400,2,1012,4.788571428571428
4570781,4,B0054SE19O,"Though it has its issues, LONDON BOULEVARD is a pretty good gangster movie, which seems to draw some of its inspiration from films like CARLITO'S WAY and even SUNSET BOULEVARD.

Fresh out of a British prison after spending three years on an assault charge, tough guy Colin Farrell is determined to go straight, even though his best buddy (Ben Chaplin) and his brutal, ultra-violent boss (Ray Winstone) are determined to bring him back into the rackets by fair means or foul.

Farrell gets a job working for reclusive movie actress Keira Knightley, who is constantly being stalked by paparazzi stationed outside of her house.  A romantic relationship develops between them, and they even make plans to escape London forever.  Unfortunately, the spurned Winstone is not about to let that happen.

William Monahan (THE DEPARTED) both wrote and makes his directing debut with LONDON BOULEVARD, which moves along at a fairly nice clip and never really loses our interest.  The cast is uniformly excellent.

The primary problem that I have with this picture is one that is shared with many of today's British movies, and that's its language.

Years ago, when actors like Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave or Trevor Howard were making films, you could hear and understand every word they said on screen.  Today, performers akin to the very talented and charismatic Colin Farrell often mumble their lines or speak in an accent and/or with slang that is difficult to understand.  You may be able to generally comprehend what is happening on screen, but the subtleties escape you.

There are also a couple of unexplained ""holes"" in the story, like: Who was the paparazzi in the olive green jacket and what was his purpose?

On the other hand, perhaps that was explained in the dialogue that I didn't understand.

Next time I watch this movie, I think I'll turn on the subtitles.

4570782,2,B0054SE19O,"This is a directorial debut for William Monahan, Oscar winning writer for Martin Scorsese-directed ""The Departed."" With two names Colin Farrell and Keira Knightley, you may expect something great in ""London Boulevard"" (the name is probably inspired by ""Sunset Boulevard""). The end result is somewhat disappointing, though.

Colin Farrell is Mitchel, an ex-convict who just got out of prison. Being hired as a bodyguard for a famous actress Charlotte (Keira Knightley) living a secluded life surrounded by the paparazzi, Mitchel starts thinking of a new life plan, but his old friends including Billy (Ben Chaplin) won't let him do that. And when a brutal local gangster Gant (Ray Winstone) steps in, things get more complicated and dangerous.

Based on the book of the same title by Ken Bruen (author of ""Blitz,"" basis of a Jason Statham film), ""London Boulevard"" is a British film noir with great atmosphere and on-location shots (thanks to the Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges, ""The Mission""). The cast is interesting, including David Thewlis and Anna Friel, with unanimously effective acting (though typecast Winstone was much better in ""Edge of Darkness"" for which William Monahan wrote the script).

The film's problem is obvious: too many subplots and characters. Anna Friel's role as Mitchel's sister is underdeveloped, and so is the character of Keira Knightley, who looks terribly bored. The story doesn't know where it is going (what does Mitchel or Charlotte really want to do anyway?). The film's pace is rushed (especially the second half) and the conclusion is a huge letdown.

The best part of the film is some stylish shots and the classic 60s rock soundtrack including The Yardbirds (used three times in the film).",1327881600,11,1741,5.229390681003585

4570785,4,B0054SE19O,"LONDON BOULEVARD is a British film that is unafraid to take a long hard look at the dark side of London - organized and unorganized crime, miscreants of all ages, vengeance, substance abuse - and still come up with a 'bruised hero' with whom we can relate.  The film has its problems: the dialects of these 'English speaking' actors is so thick that it becomes necessary to turn on the subtitles to understand the dialogue, some characters are insufficiently define, the music soundtrack overwhelms the action too frequently. Yet the cast of actors is so strong that they overcome these problems and ultimately give us a terrifyingly real glimpse at the low life happenings in that major metropolis.

Mitchel (Colin Farrell, looking better than he has in years) has just been released from jail, an experience he never wants to face again, but his old friends such as Billy (Ben Chaplin) tempt him to get back into big crime. Mitchel still stops by the street people to see his old friend Joe (Alan Williams) who warns Mithcel to stay away from Billy.  Mitchel finds a job as a bodyguard for actress Charlotte (Keira Knightley) who stays secluded from the omnipresent paparazzi in her home where she lives with an ex-actor now druggie Jordan (David Thewlis).  Billy learns of Mitchel's new job and informs the local crime lord Gant (Ray Winstone) and a plot to rob Charlotte's home is hatched.  Mitchel will have nothing to do with the plot, warning Gant that he will never work for crime again.  A series of brutal murders occur including the slaughter of old Joe by two young footballers - a deed that enrages Mitchel, but even this need for vengeance is something he cannot carry out.  The plot thickens and other atrocities arise, but Mitchel has fallen in love with the delicate Charlotte and urges her to flee to Los Angeles to rid herself of the dangers and the paparazzi. But despite Mitchel's attempts to stay clean in the midst of the thickening mire that Gant creates, he is thwarted at every turn.  The ending is a major surprise.

William Monahan (Body of Lies, The Departed, Kingdom of Heaven) wrote and directed this film based on the novel by Ken Bruen.  It is harsh, it is dark, but it is a fine example of film noir.  Colin Farrell is superb in the every difficult role of Mitchel - his acting skills are polished and his characterization is wholly credible.  The supporting cast - Winstone, Thewlis, Knightley, Chaplin, Eddie Marsan, Anna Friel as Mitchel's alcoholic wasted sister, Jamie Campbell Bower - is astonishingly fine.  This is not a film for the fainthearted, but it is a powerful little movie with many bits of afterburn to keep the audience guessing.  Grady Harp, November 11",1321401600,3,2707,4.756410256410256

Colin plays the lead character whom struggles to get his life together again after serving prison time.  The movie seemed to emphasize more on the dark-side of human nature and not enough on redemption and change for the better good.
On a side note, I did hope for a severe punishment for the duo-gangster-teenagers but was totally dissappointed at the end of the movie.

4570790,3,B0054SE19O,"This film out of the UK tanked both there and in the U. S.  Willing to take a chance based on the cast and little else, I found a reasonably good gangster film.  Sure the story is an overused one and there are too many subplots and inconsequential characters muddying up the movie but still it kept my attention.  One of the problems early on is that I had a hard time understanding what the characters were saying.  Both in terms of their delivery and the abundance of Cockney street lingo.  After about 20 minutes I decided to flip on the English subtitles which helped a lot, except I was still in the dark about some of the slang.  Interestingly enough the gangster don't use the F-bomb as much as a 4-letter epithet for a female body part that begins with a C.

A very good Colin Farrell plays Mitchel, who just completed a few years in the slammer for an altercation.  He wants to go straight but his friend and former co-worker, Billy (Ben Chaplin) hooks him back up with the crime boss, Gant (Ray Winstone).  Gant wants Mitch back in the fold, but the reluctant ex-con politely declines.  Gant asks Mitch to think about it, but we know Gant usually gets his way.

In the meantime, through a highly convoluted set of circumstances, Mitch meets a former actress, Charlotte (Keira Knightley).  Shes reclusive now as her rich, cheating husband is off to who knows where.  Shes a mess, mentally and needs help dodging the paparazzi.  Her only companion is a non-romantic stoner-friend played by David Thewlis.  The storys path is obvious with Mitch and Charlotte in a slow-burn romance and the confrontation with Gant, who won't take no for an answer.

As if to do nothing but to show Gants viciousness, first time director William Monahan (best known for his Oscar winning screenplay for The Departed) introduces characters who have no purpose other than being violently killed.  It seemed a bit much.  On a positive note, the actors nail their roles.  And the film features an excellent soundtrack.  Also of note is some beautiful settings both interior and exterior.  The camera glides effortlessly, enveloping the audience in the surroundings.  The video transfer to Blu ray is perfect as is the audio (DTS-HD Master Audio) but for a couple of scenes where the dialog was in conflict with the soundtrack.

4570792,4,B0054SE19O,"It is a story of an ex-con Mitchell (Colin Farrell) who got out of prison and who wants to put his criminal past behind him. He takes a job to work as a bodyguard for a young and unhappy actress Charlotte (Keira Knightley) and to protect her from paparazzi. Unfortunately his friends from the past and a London crime lord named Gant (Ray Winstone) don't leave him alone and pressure him to join their gang.

The story may be a clich but what makes this movie worth to watch is its cast. The scenes between Colin Farrell and Ray Winstone (especially their restaurant and parking garage scenes) were pretty intense and strong. I can say that these two actors' performances has kept the movie together. Colin Farrell was definitely in his best shape physically in this movie. He marvelously portrayed Mitchell, a gangster who doesn't want to be a gangster anymore and showed once again that he is a perfect fit for badass characters. I also liked watching David Thewlis who plays Jordan, Charlotte's agent. Unfortunately, Keira Knightley doesn't get much screen time and therefore her relationship with Mitchell neither.

4570800,3,B0054SE19O,"London Boulevard (2010)
 William Monahan directed this tight little British film noir crime drama.  Fans of great acting who enjoy a bit of grit in their film viewing will enjoy this one.  Monahan also scripted the film from the original novel by Ken Bruen.  We know Monahan best as a writer of such successful films as Kingdom of Heaven and Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.  His direction here has a straight forward honest about it, unpretentious and solid.
 We might say the same of the tale told here.  A criminal leaves prison with the intent of leaving crime behind.  However he swims in the sewer of the London underworld.  All his friends are criminals and some of them want him back in the mix, as does the local crime boss.  We meet his sister, a doomed slut whose already erratic personality finds it possible to further hurry her downward spiral by continuously dosing herself with booze and drugs.  Booze and drugs do not help her flawed decision making process.  A lovely young starlet lives in seclusion and wants the ex-con to be her handyman/bodyguard.  Her manager might be brilliant but seems to also be crazy.  There are plenty of vivid characters.
 Colin Farrell plays Mitchel, the ex-con caught in a web of criminal schemes and Keira Knightly  Charlotte the actress who falls for him.  We really do wish the two of them well and want them to find happiness.  Ray Winstone, always reliable, turns in a solid performance as the crime boss who isn't either as ruthless or as clever as he thinks.  Anne Friel has one of the plumb roles as the sister who lurches from crisis to crisis without understanding that her own actions cause the trouble.  But David Thewlis really steals the show for me as the decidedly quirky business manager/former actor to Charlotte.  We remember Thewlis from his role as Remus Lupin in the Harry Potter films.
 I don't know if Monahan as script writer added the twist at the end of the film or merely allowed it.  In any case, the twist is at once un-needed and makes the film un-satisfacrory.
 Interesting characters and fine acting cannot save the film from the final twist.  It gets a less than average two and a half saw blades.  The one hour 43 minute film found little favor with the paying public.  The $12 million budgeted film clawed back a scant $4.6 million at the box office, a sad waste of the talents of important stars and excellent back up actors.  Monahan the writer or Monahan the director might have tweaked the ending and better pleased Monahan the producer.",1429574400,,2523,4.6343115124153496

So finally after 1hr 20min I knew everybody and what they should do, but Mitchel wimps out on a must do situation (another anti climatic scene). The big build up scene has a humorous second or two but is too quick to satisfy and Mitchel doesn't follow through. I invested so much time and patience in this flick only to feel depressed at the end and through the credits. Also, not as bad as Transpoting, the Queen's cockney is a bit 'ard to rubber band innit.

4570804,5,B0054SE19O,"I don't want to give anything away. So lets just say, the acting was just amazing as you would expect. The writing was a bit inconsistent which made the main character (Farrell) look a bit confused at times as to his future. Just as I thought I had a handle on how the character was, rough, gangster type trying to figure out what he wants out of life and his direction, things change again. No issues so far really at this point in the movie I would say.  But there were to many subplots and then there were just things that Colin Farrell's Character in my opinion would not have done. Some of this movie, or much of this movie you can figure out as you go along. Nothing wrong with that. I only wish to be entertained. Knightly is just amazing and she plays her character to perfection, an Actress who is described in the movie as a ""Howard Hughes Type"". The two just work and click perfectly. But as one review in here said, don't watch it for a love story, or the idea you cant figure out how the movie is going during most of it. Watch it for the value of the entertainment of it. If you approach it from that point of view, you will really enjoy it. This is not a feel good movie, as it gives you hope at times, then takes dark turns, only to bring you back again. A real treat, and although not a lot of screen time, you do feel as though he had much more just due to his brilliance performance as a crude, and nasty crime boss, the man himself, Ray Winstone. This is a who's who of actors in my opinion. Winstone was perfect for this role and if memory serves me correctly, The Departed, and Mel Gibson's movie Edge of Darkness he played similar characters although a bit more dark in this movie. Another great and under appreciated actor was David Thewlis (Harry Potter Movie's, Seven Years In Tibet) who plays Jordan was an integral part of this movie as well. He enabled for the two lead actors Knightley and Farrell to interact well together and was used as a buffer and he certainly added to the enjoyment of this movie, and gave it some very dark and intelligent humor at times.

I don't want to give anything away, but you can see by watching the preview, or reading what it is about, that Farrell is out of jail, looks for work, wants to have a more normal life or any life at all, and finds Knightley and then the story really begins. It is at this point that I thought there were mistakes made in that I felt this character would not have made. Not someone who was in Jail, and was around people who lead a life of crime. So it was in that, the few inconsistencies in Farrell's character that just made me scratch my head and think, no way would he do this or that. So that all said, I still loved the movie, I gave it 5 stars due to how entertained I was, but I think they could have done just a bit better with the writing. The type of language, meaning the use of language, street language, code words, and just the way all the actors communicated was just different and so well done. This was very different, and you have to watch it to understand more of what I am saying. I also thought the chemistry between Knightly and Farrell was outstanding.  So, I would say it's worth every dime, and sit back and enjoy. Remember, you will not feel like you just watched a Disney film when done. It is dark, with some moments of levity and light.

Well, nothing works. The filmmaker can't seem to make up his mind about Redemption, Vendetta or Romance. So the whole thing curdles way before its predictable ending (you know the ""doomed hero"" is going to be done in by that teen punk he decides not to kill - I guess this is called Dramatic Irony 101). None of the characters, except for the always charismatic Farrell, are people we care about or root for. The villain is so mean it's beyond caricature - he belongs in an Austin Powers flik. The look of the film is polished as all get-up but adds to the emptiness of the material, and the Yardbird tunes, classic as they are, are used for no apparent reason - is the story supposed to take place in the 60's, does the leading man collect old rock ditties? Kiera Knightley, usually a superb actress and always a stunning presence, is stuck with a thankless part of a wimpy character with no interesting lines of dialogue to say. She seems to fall for Colin Farrell not just because he's the leading man and such an irresistible hunk, but also because, next to the David Thewlis character (her protector from the paparazzi), he looks like he bathes at least once a day - maybe he learned that in prison. There are a lot of subordinate characters and quasi-subplots that seem to be there simply as filler - certainly none of them advance the plot any. Which brings me to this: it is always a danger when writers (or stars) decide to direct their own material with no one there to keep their feet on terra firma. This particular writer-director seems to fall into that category. A shame, as Farrell, Knightley and Thewlis deserve better. The Blu-Ray disk is absolutely gorgeous to look at and the sound recording is crisp, but some of you might be offended (or bored) by the overuse of the F word.",1366156800,2,2002,4.517906336088155
4570819,5,B0054SE19O,"London Boulevard received only middling reviews, but I found it to be smart, funny, clever, and hugely enjoyable. Colin Farrell, who seems to make weak films in American production, chooses far better films when working overseas (In Bruges, for example) and London Boulevard is no exception. This is a brilliant film, and the blu-ray is of superb quality. This is well worth the low purchase price.",1363651200,3,398,5.045454545454546
4570820,4,B0054SE19O,Excellent movie. Many surprises and wonderful acting and above all a very good dark story. Characters were believable and the soundtrack is phenomenal!,1363392000,,151,5.608695652173913
4570821,3,B0054SE19O,It's pretty good. I've seen much worse movies. It's average. I bought it because I heard that there is some music in it by The Yardbirds.,1363392000,2,137,4.3076923076923075
4570822,2,B0054SE19O,"At the time I read the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/London-Boulevard/dp/B003H4I5EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">London Boulevard</a>&nbsp;by Ken Bruen, it was being filmed in Great Britain by William Monaghan, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of ""The Departed,"" who was making his directorial debut. (Monaghan also writes the screenplay for this British film.) LONDON BOULEVARD was not widely shown in American movie houses: it took me a while to find the dvd.  I wish I had just re-read the book.

The story parodies the 1950 movie by Billy Wilder called ""Sunset Boulevard.""  An ex-con leaves prison, doesn't want to return, and finds employment as a handyman with a reclusive actress who lives grandly in a large home.  Her only servant is a butler.  The ex-con soon shares gifts and other favors from his beautiful employer.

The film is well cast. Colin Farrell plays the lead role of the ex-con Mitchell and Kiera Knightley the beautiful, but reclusive young actress. Beautiful people with not much chemistry...in the movie. Mitch spends his time shooing away the paparazzi. Anna Friel plays Michell's sister Briony. In the book she is slightly mad, a confirmed shoplifter, often forgetting her husband is dead. She arrives at Mitch's Welcome Home party ""looking like a radiant bag lady"" and apologizes for Frank's absence. In the film she is love-crazed and well-dressed...just another ditzy gal. David Thewlis plays an effete butler.  He wears wrinkled hippy-like clothes, rarely shaves and has long straggly hair.  Wonderful wit but not a bit like the proper and tuxedoed Max Von-something in ""Sunset Boulevard.""  Thewlis plays a careless protector who mainly sits at a kitchen table smoking funny cigarettes and talking about his career as an actor. Ray Winstone has the plum role of the vicious crime boss Mr. Gant.  He constantly growls with murderous intent in the film. In the book a well-dressed Gant asks the well-dressed Mitch to a posh restaurant in Covent Garden to help him organize his debt collections and to steal Lillian's Silver Ghost Rolls-Royce.

Although the funeral of Joe, Mitch's favorite newspaper seller, is somber here...it's out of control in the book. The only mourners, Mitch throws a copy of ""Big Issue"" on the lowering coffin and Briony invites a street musician dressed in kilts to play the bagpipes.

Monahan would have done well to let Ken Bruen write the screenplay.  Bruen's characters are funny and quirky.  And he saves the violence for the end of the story.

I should have watched the dvd with subtitles...did I miss the Bruen wit? And don't blink: you'll miss the grand vintage fancy cars....and the love scenes.",1356739200,2,2706,5.304449648711944
4570823,1,B0054SE19O,"It seems to me they left out the plot to this movie. Most of the characters are cardboard, things happen that are meant to ""ironic"" but which really were just the directory/writer trying to write themselves out of corner. The ending was very unsatisfying, and came on like they had forgotten about it and then realized they were almost out of film. You'd think that with the people involved it could have been interesting.",1356566400,7,422,4.716216216216216

Having never been a gangster I feel that this movie captures what I imagine life might be like for a gangster who hits the edge. Very violent. Shocking plot twists keep you on your toes the whole way through, and yet there are many gentle scenes that depict a tender relationship between the main character and his protective charge. Very violent. Liked it alot.",1355702400,3,521,4.865168539325842
4570826,4,B0054SE19O,"I loved this movie. Colin Farrell's character was someone we would all want as a friend & he played it so well.  I especially liked the scene in the restaurant as Mitchel is stating why it would not be good if he was a gangster!  He was very convincing & looked so cool, which always helps.(what a scene!)
As for Keira Knightley's character; why wouldn't she fall in love with Mitchel?  He wanted nothing from her, only to love & protect her and for free no less!
Plus there is David Thewlis, who was absolutely wonderful. His acting/timing was impeccable.  And yes, he very nearly stole the show, but then he often does.
Then there was Ben Chaplin, who was also very very good. He is another actor that does not disappoint.
I'm quite surprised by the negative reviews. Plus I do not think it was 'just another gangster movie' at all. That's why I bought it and will continue to watch it many times!

Guess when I get these London crime movies I'm expecting ""LOCK, STOCK"", ""SNATCH"", or ""ROCKNROLLA"", or even ""LAYER CAKE""...those I really enjoy, so I guess my expectations are just too high going in...this is not bad, not great, a little better than average but one thing is for sure....LONDON BLVD can't hold a candle to those Guy Ritchie flicks or even LAYER CAKE in my opinion, so to give 5 stars is just WAY too much.  3 and 1/2 stars for me!
So if u like those other four films a lot that I mentioned earlier, you'll probably be disappointed with this one...but this is as good or better than another one I kind of enjoyed, IN BRUGES.  Definitely entertaining enough to watch again though!",1344470400,,814,4.493243243243243

4570834,5,B0054SE19O,"Brian DePalma was considered a master plagiarist by many.  It's with little irony that ""London Boulevard"" reminds you of DePalma's ""Carlito's Way"".  Director William Monahan also references Martin Scorsese which also ironically Monahan wrote the Oscar winning script for ""The Departed"" which was a reimagining of the Hong Kong crime thriller ""Infernal Affairs"".  The question you ask yourself is Monahan's effort more than the sum of it's influences?  The answer to me is a resounding yes.  Similarities to other films cannot be denied but when done right you call it a homage.  Monahan introduces enough unique fluorishes and twists to elevate it above mere copycat status.  Colin Farrell is magnetic and macho as the recently released con who wants to go straight in a world that keeps pulling him into a life of crime.  Ray Winstone adds another indelible portrait to his personal rogues gallery as a sadistic crime boss.  David Thewlis nearly steals the show as the foppish manager of Keira Knightley's papparazzi stalked movie starlet.  The film kept me rapt and invigorated throughout.  For those who would dismiss ""London Boulevard"" as derivative I ask you to consider Bogart, Cagney, and Edward G.  They were gangster archetypes who didn't play the same character twice.  ""London Boulevard"" is a variation of the British gangster tradition that includes ""Get Carter"", ""The Long Good Friday"", ""Mona Lisa"" and ""Sexy Beast'.",1336694400,13,1429,5.214912280701754
4570835,1,B0054SE19O,"I looked forward to seeing what William Monaghan could do on his own, away from the watchful eye of Martin Scorsese and a seriously overrated film like THE DEPARTED. He seems to have a good head on his shoulders, and a good ear for dialogue. But where THE DEPARTED lacked in gravity, LONDON BOULEVARD lacks in just about everything.

Basically we have an ex-con (Colin Farrell, looking like he needs some Grecian Formula), his crazed drug-addled sister (an amazingly bizarre Anna Friel), his idiot criminal friend (Ben Chaplin, channelling his inner coke-fiend), a damaged and agoraphopic film starlet (Keira Knightley, happy to finally be out of those horrible PIRATES films), her stoner caretaker (the brilliant David Thewlis), and a prerequisite volatile, vulgar and racist crime boss (Ray Winstone, phoning it in here).

The main problem with this film is that it starts out strong with a not-entirely novel concept of an ex-con trying to stay as far away as possible from re-entering that life but keeps being pulled by two opposing forces, but it spirals completely out of control once Ray Winstone enters the picture. His character is less of a fleshed-out character and more of a gimmick. He exists solely to force the protagonist of our film to certain extremes. Character arcs as well as storylines are left incomplete. There seems to be a great deal of footage that was left on the cutting room floor that might elongate the runtime of the film, but it might help to complete and clear up some gaping holes. I will never say that I don't love a great film that makes you think or wonder after the credits start rolling, but the story has to make sense first.

Aside from the solid work that Farrell, Knightley (who continues to impress after films like the brilliant NEVER LET ME GO and A DANGEROUS METHOD), and Thewlis do, this film is so far beyond making any kind of narrative sense, it's ridiculous. No character is given an opportunity to get fleshed out; the dialogue is pretty rote for this type of film; the direction by Monaghan seems inspired at first, but then becomes less of a homage to the 70's British crime films that apparently inspired it and more of a ripoff.

There's almost no level that the film works at other than the three performers I mentioned already, and the ending is beyond moronic. It's very rare I find myself shouting at a film in incredulous anger, but LONDON BOULEVARD did it.",1336521600,5,2423,4.761904761904762

It was good to see Colin Ferrel offering up yet another convincing role. It's just a shame he didn't have a better vehicle to roll with it.
