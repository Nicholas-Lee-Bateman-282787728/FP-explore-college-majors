8129886,1,B000GAKL8A,"I felt my 4 year old getting dumber as she watched this awful show. They begin by teaching each letter (good for a 2 year old maybe). Then they start spelling words like popcorn and xylophone without even explaining why the words are spelled the way they are. Plus, the guy is super creepy.",1484524800,,290,4.388888888888889
8129887,1,B000GAKL8A,"I  rate this dvd one star only because I can't rate it lower.  It offers absolutely nothing in helping a child, special or not, learn to spell.  The absolutely boring man spells a few words that he writes on a whiteboard.  The words range from two letter words to xylophone, but without anything to build on.  I use word families to build on,  for example ""ake"" (cake, bake, etc), or ""at"" words (cat, rat, etc).  It is a 30 minute  dvd,  but  he also builds a story.  If you want your child to learn to spell, you are better off creating something yourself.  I purchased it because I wanted to put something into the dvd player when I want him to put in some learning time while being entertained.  He was not entertained and there is not much a kid can learn from that dvd.  If you still want to purchase it, you can get it at Christian Books for $15.00.  I suggest getting something else or creating your own learning tool.",1440201600,,925,4.296511627906977
8129888,4,B000GAKL8A,This is a great learning tool and there is an entire series.  Just don't pay these prices and look up a christian store for better pricing!  You can afford 2 for this price there!,1337040000,,179,4.235294117647059
