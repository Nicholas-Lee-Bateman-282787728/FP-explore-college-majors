Since watching this I have literally told strangers while standing in line at the store that they needed to watch this. I watch a lot of comedians, and I'm not saying ""He's"" the greatest,  but this performance of his 100% IS!!",1384128000,4,338,4.365079365079365

6044430,5,B00G1WJSVI,"Love this guy .very funny , interesting,and fresh material Christopher titus Is the best comedian working today. IWould go see him in a minute.",1399680000,2,143,5.0
6044431,5,B00G1WJSVI,"#1, I love Christopher Titus.  There are so many areas that I can relate to.  No, no beer drinking dad or crazy mom, but the
everyday things that he talks about are things that can or did happen to most of us.  High school...just crazy enough.  Marriage,
pretty much right on.
This is a fun evening with CT.  Now I have to watch my other shows.  Will be laughing later on.
Oh, if you have a chance to see him in person, and you are not afraid of irreverent comments that sometimes strike right on the
head, be sure and see him.  I know if he comes back to my neck of the woods, I will not miss him.",1397865600,2,598,3.9747899159663866
6044432,5,B00G1WJSVI,"Few fans of stand up will argue that Christopher Titus is not only among the best stand up comedians of today, but that Titus is undoubtedly among the all time great stand up comedians.

All of Christopher Titus DVD specials are excellent, but Norman Rockwell is Bleeding is truly the greatest stand up material every pieced together.

If your familiar with Christopher Titus short lived sitcom on FOX ""Titus"", you know that the episodes of that brilliant show were nearly all 100% based on material from ""Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding"".

How many other 90 minute stand up specials have ever had enough hilarious and excellent material contained in them to fill 3 seasons worth of episodes for a sitcom that is renowned by both critics and fans alike? Simply put...none. Only ""Norman Rockwell is Bleeding"".

There is no other stand up performance that is even in the same realm of excellence as Christopher Titus's ""Norman Rockwell is Bleeding"", you owe it to yourself to see it.",1396310400,2,977,4.867469879518072
6044433,5,B00G1WJSVI,I love to see Christopher Titus.  He is the funnest man.  We have seen him at the Fox and he was GREAT!,1395100800,,103,3.6363636363636362
6044434,5,B00G1WJSVI,"I have been trying to find this video for a long time, I'm so glad I did. The price was great the quality was great I  would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family.",1391299200,,180,4.0
6044435,5,B00G1WJSVI,"Christopher Titus is the man without a perfect family - and instead of whining 'Why Me' or going out and committing
violent acts against society as a whole, he turns it all as positively as he can - as a source for comedy. While there are times that you will commisserate with his darkest stories, his ability to turn it around to making you laugh is amazing, not to mention, inspiring to many in similar situations.

There is bad language - though for a relatively main stream comedian, it is less vulgar than many I have heard. Despite the language, I still give it 5 stars!",1389657600,,576,4.433962264150943
6044436,5,B00G1WJSVI,"If you are either in a bad relationship or from a dysfunctional family you will relate to most of his routines. But if you are on the fence with buying this, do not sit long as these dvds of his may not be on Amazon long as Titus usually only sells his stuff on his own website. One of the best comedians out there.",1387065600,,315,3.9375
8620121,5,B00G1WJSVI,"Very few stand up comics are worth me purchasing.  There are those that are good comics, then there are those like Titus that make you laugh until you cry.  Glad I can finally add this special to my collection.  I've watched it several times before buying it and will enjoy watching it again and again with friends and family.",1471219200,,326,4.491525423728813
8620122,5,B00G1WJSVI,"They have to re-release this. I have the audio, but his body language adds so much, you really need the visuals. Christopher Titus is the sort of comic you enjoy as much the fifth time as the first, and his talent for finding the humor in the dysfunctions of life is genius. I have seen him perform live, and he is also a gracious and genuine person when dealing with his fans. Please, someone, make this DVD available again!",1448064000,,425,4.3924050632911396

8620128,5,B00G1WJSVI,"You've seen it, and its still funny on repeat watchings. Complex humor: wry, self-deprecating, twisted at times. It's as much fun to watch other people's reactions if they've never seen it and aren't familiar with Christopher Titus' Life and Times: ""wait, did he just say?? Did I/you just laugh at that?"" Good stuff.",1411948800,,316,4.981132075471698
8620129,5,B00G1WJSVI,"Brilliant performance depicting the life of a child of an alcoholic father and a mentally disturbed mother!

If you grew up with f**ked up, dysfunctional parents (like a lot of us), you will find Titus absolutely HILARIOUS !

Now, if you grew up with loving, kind, supportive parents, you will be watching his standup in disbelief but still HILARIOUS !",1410652800,,352,4.85
