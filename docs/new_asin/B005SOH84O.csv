6235011,4,B005SOH84O,"FILM RATING:  4 stars

The best movie I've seen in 2011 so far is Sarah's Key (2010). This French-English import is one of those little ""sleeper"" movies that totally surprises you and blows you away when you see it. Sarah's Key has a very emotional core to it that really looks into the human condition from multiple perspectives. And it searches for the ""truth"" within. This is a movie much in the vein of Schindler's List (1993), The Pianist (2002), The Reader (2008), and The English Patient (1996). It's not exactly ""light"" fare. But it's also not quite as dark as Schindler's List or The Pianist. I found the weaving of the two main story lines, one past and one present, to be perfect. It's not always easy for a filmmaker to pull together past and present set stories, with actors playing the same character at various ages, but director Gilles Paquet-Brenner found a way to do it brilliantly. And the same can be said for the way he weaves together both French and English languages into the movie. I never felt like I was ""working"" to follow the dialogue through reading subtitles. Granted, the movie is only partially subtitled. Parts of it are in English and parts are in French.

The story centers around the events of the French round-up of its own Jewish citizens in July 1942. That's right...the French, not the Germans. Of course I'm sure the French were feeling pressure from the Germans during the time. And yet it's hard to overlook the fact that the French were just as guilty of genocide as the Germans and Russians. One can truly understand why there was a ""World"" war at this time. Sarah's Key is simply sharing another piece of the puzzle that we've been reluctant to look at until recently because of how ugly the puzzle is. The impact of this ugly mindset at the time spreading from country to country across the globe must have been like a virus, gradually infecting each host and getting them from within. The opening scenes with the capture of Sarah's family and their move to an internment camp at Auschwitz are gripping to say the least. Sarah, played brilliantly by young actress Mlusine Mayance, makes a choice on how to save her younger brother from the horrors she anticipates will fall upon them. But that choice has consequences, as we soon find out. I don't want to give too much of the story away, since it is much better to let the movie unfold it for you.

Kristin Scott Thomas plays a modern journalist, investigating this historic incident, while at the same time unravelling a very personal and ironic connection to it. The film does require that you let go of what could be too ""coincidental"" for reality. But remember, this is a fictional movie at the end of the day, inspired by real events. And movies by their very nature, are contrived to some degree. I never found myself getting lost in my mind thinking about how unrealistic some of the story arcs were. Instead, I simply felt emotionally engaged in the suspenseful and thrilling discovery of all of the secrets that Sarah's Key possesses. And I credit all of the talented artists who contributed to making that possible in this film. The writing, editing, cinematography, production design, acting, music and sound are top notch for this small indie film rumored to be made for less than $10 million. Sarah's Key is an amazing accomplishment for so little money, and a reminder to Hollywood that it's not the size of the budget of a movie that really matters for its quality. To me its the assembly and collaboration of many talented people unified to tell a great story.

There are two scenes that really stand out for me in the film. The first being the opening with Sarah and her brother tickling and giggling with each other under the covers in bed. The director is clearly showing us the innocent fun times of childhood. The camera work there and that little slice of ""happy"" to start the film with are an incredible contrast to the darker more ""adult"" tone of the rest of the film. The second scene that really caught my eye is when Sarah and a fellow young female companion are floating in a murky, muddy river, cleansing themselves. Both of these scenes are just small, idealized, dreamy cinematic sequences that on their own, offer needed artistic moments of escape from the story. Within any horrific context, there's always still something beautiful to be discovered and seen if one looks for it. And director Paquet-Brenner shares that.

Music composer Max Richter has created an unbelievably perfect music score for Sarah's Key that not only elevates the film, but is an incredible work to listen to all on its own. The score has mostly a classic sound to it, but Richter also incorporates bits of modern music composition and style as well. It's one of the best film scores I've heard in years. Within the film, the score gives many scenes their emotional gravity, as is typically the case. But something about Richter's music here stands out from the typical score. And you'll know it when you hear it.

I could spend a lot more time discussing the themes, ideas and incredible filmmaking prowess present in Sarah's Key, but I firmly believe in letting movies speak for themselves as well. I've given you a little to chew on and hopefully inspire you to see this film, even though on the surface (or by its book cover), Sarah's Key looks like a ""heavy"" film. I challenge you to watch it and grab on to it in some manner. It's movies like this that really give cinema its name. And I'm glad to see that we are still making these films, especially within the broader worldwide cinematic context we are now within.

At the end of Sarah's Key, my eyes were red from the tears that flowed throughout the film. And my mind was speechless as I just embraced the very strong emotional connection I felt with the story and the film. I'm personally always looking for movies that can give me that kind of experience. Don't get me wrong, I love the epic, action-filled extravaganzas like Inception (2010) and Saving Private Ryan (1998) as well. But it's small films like Sarah's Key that more often fill my cinematic diet now with the nutrition that I need.",1314316800,92,6165,4.6599264705882355
6235012,5,B005SOH84O,"This is one of the best movies of the year. There are two interlocking plots. The first focuses on Sarah's experience in 1942. She, age 10, her parents, and her brother, age 5, whom she loves dearly, live in a small apartment in France. The Nazis come to take them away and kill them because they are Jewish. Sarah decides to save her brother. She hides him in a closet within a paneled wall and locks it with a key. She tells her brother not to make a sound nor try to come out until she returns, and she promises the frightened boy that she will return. The Nazis make her return impossible. She and her parents are driven to a concentration camp and her parents are murdered there. Although a long time has passed, she is determined to return to her brother and keep her promise. She never lets go of the key, neither then nor for the rest of her life. She escapes from the concentration camp and is helped by non-Jewish husband and wife farmers. They rushed to the apartment and....

 The second plot focuses on a journalist in the present who writes about the hellish butchery of the Jews by the French. The journalist's husband now owns/possesses the Jewish family's apartment, and she learns the story of Sarah and her key. She feels that she is unable to live in this apartment because of its history, even though her husband had it totally remolded, and....

 She feels driven to find out what happened to Sarah. Did she escape the Nazi clutches? If yes, where is she now? How did she cope with her experiences and especially with the events surrounding the key? What she discovers is tragic in many ways, especially, in my mind, the affect it had on her, and that she furthered the Nazi plan to rid the world of Jews, because....

 I do not want to disclose what I indicated with ellipses. These facts are powerful and should be seen.",1314144000,21,1844,4.456973293768546
6235013,2,B005SOH84O,"First, I didn't hate this movie.  This summary won't contain spoilers because it's worth seeing if only for the acting.  I am very big fan of Kristen Scott Thomas.  Her work in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-ve-Loved-You-So-Long-Blu-ray/dp/B001GCUO6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I've Loved You So Long [Blu-ray</a>]was Oscar-worthy.  Her acting here is no-less perfect, but the script she is working suffers from a lack of common sense.  The story of French Jews deported into the hands of Nazis is worth telling, but the way it's done here is awkward and fragmented.  The present day mystery angle, where Thomas comes in, is also interesting, but the writer delved into scenes that truly wore on my patience.  For instance, when she is trying to track down a certain character in present day New York City, she has to take a cab from address to address to address trying to find who she is looking for.  Why could she have not used a telephone and saved herself the time?  Also, she has to fly all over the world to see some people, where she could have just done it either on the phone, e-mail, etc.  If the mystery portion of the film was set pre-Internet, than maybe I could buy more of this.  Also, when a group of characters make a discovery in an apartment, children are present in a moment where no adult in their right mind would allow them to be.  It was quite ludicrous.  So while this film gets high marks for acting and cinematography, don't expect to love it - and DO expect to roll your eyes quite a bit. 2.5 out of 5.",1313884800,9,1578,4.843283582089552
6235014,5,B005SOH84O,"The story of a 1942 Jewish family being evicted from their home in Paris and sent to a camp is interwoven with the plot of a modern-day reporter trying to determine what happened to the little girl in the family. Scenes of the fate of Jewish people at the time are always powerful to watch, with this one being no exception. The anguish of families being separated is realistically portrayed, but their eventual fate is not depicted. The story revolves around the little girl, Sarah, trying to determine the fate of her brother. The other story features the always good Kristin-Scott Thomas, doing a story on the eviction of Jews from Paris, and focusing on understanding the fate that befell Sarah. This is a powerful film that will captivate the viewer.",1312070400,123,755,4.770992366412214

6235071,4,B005SOH84O,"In Sarah's key the title character is playing with her brother in their bed when there's a knock on the front door with someone yelling they're the police and will kick the door in if the mother doesn't open it.  Sarah knows that males have been being removed by these raids, their father is supposedly hiding somewhere away from there and she doesn't want her brother taken, so locks him in a cupboard in their room and tells him to be quiet.  Of course she and her mother who plays along with the lie, didn't realise the roundupperers had now moved onto to taking the females as well.  They have no idea as well, that those taking them have no intention of ever letting them come back.  Sarah still has the key to the cupboard in her clothing and is worried she needs to get back to the apartment to let her brother out but of course isn't getting a choice in where she goes at all.

Somewhere near the beginning in a scene set in the present, (this is one of those films that flashes back and forth along the timeline) the journalist (Kristen Scott Thomas' character) mentions out loud in frustration how there are no records of what happened to Sarah or the family members of the flat her relatives took occupation of after the original Jewish family was round up.  Her son finds this odd as the Germans were known for keeping detailed records.  She informs him it wasn't the Germans who did this, it was the French.  That's what this movie is about, a fictional character followed account of how the French locals now with German occupation approval, turned on their own people, and gleefully round up the segment of the population they hated to be sent away and treated like less than animals at the time (and as we know most of them were killed). From the French police and stadium/camp guards who enjoyed their new power, to the snitch neighbour who loved being the eyes and ears for those rounding up so they'd know if a little boy was likely still there, to those who lived opposite the stadium who knew what was going on there, complained about the smell, but didn't do a thing to try and stop and it.  If you ever travel around Europe you'll come across this in many occupied at the time cities, so it wasn't unique to Paris or the French part of history.  For some reason though World War II atrocities are somewhat simplified in education at our schools outside of Europe  to limiting it to Germans were bad, allied countries were good. When we know evil existed amongst all citizens, the War just gave them an opportunity to act out these fantasies.

I thought the 1942 parts of the film were really well done, well acted, especially by the girl playing Sarah (M&eacute;lusine Mayance, who was also very good in a film called Ricky that came out in 2009, a year before this).  I found the modern day storyline not as interesting though, and even well, a little boring at times.  I would have preferred more of the film concentrated on the 1940's and what happened to those taken.",1511136000,3,2994,4.489871086556169

I had seen the movie starring Kristin Scott Thomas, a couple of years ago but wanted to see it again after just finishing 'The Nightingale,' by Kristin Hannah. This novel of historical fiction was also set in France but dealt with the extraordinary role played by French Women in the defeat of the German war machine. Ms Hannah and Ms De Rosnay struck up a friendship during the writing of Ms Hannah's book.

Kristin Scott Thomas is marvellous as she always is. In fact the whole cast is perfect. Perhaps I should have given this five stars but that rating, for me, would only be for great films and this doesn't quite fall into that category.",1421020800,,374,4.597014925373134
6235526,5,B005SOH84O,"Despite the appalling events of 1942, Sarah's Key is not oppressively depressing or intense.  The movie is a mystery about a missing person -- in this case, a young, French Jewish woman named Sarah -- who was last seen by people who loved her and thought that they understood her.  The story gives dignity and meaning to the lives of those affected by the terrible genocides of World War II.  As we are drawn into the quest to find-out about Sarah, we learn bits and pieces about her story and her escape, as a child, from a German concentration camp.  The movie leads us to conclude that time does not heal all wounds, that history casts a long shadow into the future as well as into the past, and that we should not judge anyone's response to horror and trauma.  As all good mysteries do, the ending provides satisfying surprises and closure.

Beautifully made with superb acting and music, Sarah's key is excellent.",1420848000,,918,4.601226993865031

I do recommend this book and movie to readers and movie-goers.,1417219200,,356,4.476923076923077

It is stated that the format is 1.85 ratio but is in fact 2.35 ratio. It is stated that the language is English, but in fact most of the film is spoken in French and German with English subtitles. So instead of being able to ""watch"" the characters I spent all my time ""reading"".

The central narrative of the film is concerned with the fate of one particular family and their children.  Motivated both by her own personal circumstances, and the broader historical context, a journalist (played by Kristin Scott Thomas) focuses intensely on this ""story.""  There is some French dialogue, which is subtitled in English, but this does not disturb the pace of the film -- which I thought was an excellent cinematic adaptation of the original book.  Due to its subject matter, much of the film is obviously distressing, particularly for children.

Plus there was one all together new scene that was not in the book and another scene altered quite a bit. Also, probably 90% of the movie is sub-titled, so you're reading and missing some of the visual. I still enjoyed it and was it was interesting to see how they adapted the book for cinema.

It was very well acted by all the cast and more than anything it caused an unbelievable amount of discussion afterwards, for days, in fact.

I have learned so much about history lately that I never realized all that truly happened to the Jewish people. I don't know that I would have children watch the film, maybe your teenagers if you watch it with them to discuss History.

Sarah's Key is another in this tradition that examines the journey of families, survivors and their descendants. It is a good story, compellingly told, about a small aspect of the Holocaust, the rounding up of the French Jews, their incarceration and ultimate end and of one little girl who managed to escape and survived the war but not the memories.
There are a million (six million, a hundred million) stories, most untold and never to be told that need to be told and remembered to prevent such a thing from ever happening again.",1389744000,,731,4.7637795275590555

6235746,4,B005SOH84O,"This movie tells the story of Sarah, a young Jewish girl who, along with her mother and father, is swept up in the French purge during WWII.  Separated from her parents, her one and only goal is to get back to the apartment in Paris where she has hidden her younger brother.  Flipping back and forth with this story is the tale of Julia, an American living in Paris with her husband and daughter.  Julia discovers that her husband's family took over the apartment after Sarah and her family were taken away, and becomes obsessed with finding out what happens to Sarah.  Julia is not nearly as interesting as Sarah, and her motives are hard to discern.  Mingled in with her growing obsession is her newly discovered pregnancy and her husband's desire that she abort the baby.  Although she ultimately discovers what became of Sarah, her own story is not very compelling and pretty hard to understand why she is so consumed about Sarah's mystery.  (Spoiler alert) Also, I did not understand why Sarah took her own life after she so clearly overcame her hardships and apparently found happiness with her husband and son in New York.  Maybe it is explained in the book, which I did not read, but I found it disconcerting in the movie.  All in all, the movie is worth seeing just to watch the wonderful young actress who plays Sarah, and for the story of the French involvement in the Nazi purge of Jews.  Kristin Scott Thomas is a wonderful actress, but her character in this movie does not showcase her talent.",1389312000,,1507,4.610486891385768

I was glad to see that there were only the most minor of changes, the most significant being Sarah's life in America and psychological state as an older woman being expressed and told by her husband rather than implied as it was in the book. Otherwise, the movie was mostly faithful to the book. The scenes in the Vel D'Hiv were not as chaotic and awful as I had pictured - but still nightmarish. The young actress who played Sarah was perfect, driven, haunted, and too old for her years. As with the book, the movie was hearbreaking.",1388361600,,588,4.306306306306307

I admired her. As the story unfolded and the truth of what happened came to life the pain and agony the people suffered was unbearable to see.

It is interwoven between the lives of four families centering mainly on the girl, Sarah, and the journalist, played by the wonderful Kristen Scot Thomas, who traces back by investigating  Sarah's ultimate  destination and in so doing finds her own.

The setting in this movie is Paris France and is brought to a personal level by the role of Kristin Scott Thomas and her quest to unravel the mystery of what became of a young Jewish girl and her family who were sent to camps by the French.  This quest brings out secrets of her husband's family that have been kept since the war and affects the whole family.

There is no one in the picture who is not living through something viscerally difficult and heartbreaking.

The inexpungible  survivor depression sends out tendrils of despair that touch everyone they come in contact with.

6235828,3,B005SOH84O,"I am trying to write this without including spoilers...

I would recommend the movie because it is a good story and because I am always a fan of Kristin Scott Thomas!  However, I watched the movie right after finishing the book and was disappointed in some of the decisions made to convert the story into a movie. Understanding that not every character will be included and new characters might inexplicably pop up, I feel that some of the decisions obscured important and complex themes raised in the book and resulted in melodrama.  For example, I feel that the character of Julia's husband Bertrand was miscast.  What defines her husband's character and, importantly, drives some of Julia's later decisions gets totally lost.

Less importantly I don't understand why her daughter Zoe became pretty much a non-entity in the movie while she was actually a strong supporter of Julia in the book.  They might have just as well cut her character since she does nothing for the story line.
One of the issues that Sarah grappled with is that she felt inadequately prepared by her parents for the possibility of such a horrific event.  Had she been less protected she might have acted differently in the beginning (not leaving her brother behind).  Zoe, close in age to Sarah during the round-up, is a similarly strong character who wants to understand what is happening and why things are going on (especially in regards to her family).

I believe the story lines where tied up too neatly, characters and issues were watered down and simplified, and in the middle of the movie, an important change in the story takes away entirely what was Julia's motivation in the first place (in the book) of trying to find Sarah - explaining that her in-law's were a good and caring family after all.  So, while I would encourage anyone to watch the movie, I would really recommend reading the book first.

I had not known about the events associated with the Vel d'Hiv and the movie very successfully depicts the horrors of the round-up, the camps and the sense of helplessness and despair.  The scenes are powerful and will stay with me.  I believe the movie succeeded less in the second half where I didn't feel a strong connection with the characters anymore. Don't really want to harp on it but if I hadn't read the book before, I would have not understood many of Julia's actions (as well as the depiction of the older Sarah) or thought them overly melodramatic.",1367193600,,2451,4.752358490566038

6235832,5,B005SOH84O,"This is a story of Compassion vs. Inhumanity.  It has been repeated throughout history mostly to Jews but also people of other faiths and races.  Hiding one's family and name, being raised by different faiths and races.

During WWII the French got busy getting along with or subverting the evil in their midst.  To get this movie; have your family identity destroyed or threatened or to know someone who did.  Spend countless hours with those who have been through spiritual/emotional holocausts, and this story has many elements of truth in common with theirs.  Children robbed of innocence, trying to hide a past, trying to be something else because your identity may cost you everything, possibly your own children.  People you trusted turned on you.  People you didn't know came to your rescue.  Strangers raised you and hid your identity within theirs.  People you thought were your enemy, broke the rules that you might escape.  You end up doing the very thing that goes contrary to all humanity ""think only of yourself.""  Your parents don't even trust you and attack your actions.  After all the evil that was done there are no pictures or buildings, even though it took place in broad daylight in a downtown Paris.  Its a story that is untold until a Journalist becomes personally involved.

The story of Sarah and the Journalist intertwined as they deal with issues of expediency and doing the right things.  On the surface people who appeared to serve themselves didn't.  People who didn't need to serve themselves did. Sarah's teen lifestyle becomes that of many who have been through a physical or spiritual holocaust.  The Journalist goes on her own wanderings too, to save a life.  In the end someone is restored to their Jewish roots at a time when it is safe to be a Jew again.  Today many people are finding out their Jewish, and Muslims with Christians are finding the Hebrew roots of their faiths.  It is a time for rejoicing and grief.  The truth is the lancet of G-d for our healing.",1365465600,,2004,4.7645348837209305
6235833,4,B005SOH84O,"Kristin Scott-Thomas plays a American journalist married to a French man living in Paris. They are trying to find more space for their crowded family and eventually dedcide to renovate her husband's parent's flat which leads to the discovery of an unpleasant part of her family's life.

""Sarah's Key"" tells the story of the French government inprisoning Jewish citizens during World War II in an effort to appeasse the Nazis. It is a part of history that I knew very little about and the film does a great job of depicting the sad chapter. As Julia (Scott-Thomas) digs into her husband's family's history, she uncovers the story of Sarah, a ten-year old who lived in the same apartment with her family, before they were taken to an interment facility by the French government.

The story is emotional, believable and heart wrenching. But the studio is trying to market this as a film with a great surprise, a great reveal. It doesn't have that. Pretty early on, you know what this big reveal will be, so it seems anticlimatic and mars the overall experience.

I was 10 yrs. old when all this happened to Sara and her brother.  I have always been interested in that time, my Dad was in WWII.  When I went to school we were taught these things that happened, not like today.  Children have no idea in History that was taught in my era.  It is a lost generation to so many.

I picked it up on a whim, not having read the book or even having heard of it.  I looked it over briefly, concluding that it was a mild mystery story that invites you, the viewer, to participate in a manner that could be a more serious version of clue.  I cannot explain why that thought came to me, but it was enough to come home and purchase it on Amazon the next time I was online.
I watched it two days ago and it lingers in my consciousness even now... Haunting and well done, I think, and while not what I expected, it exceeded my anticipation of a moderately entertaining movie-evening.  I have placed it on my topmost shelf of collected movies... I do not feel qualified to judge what might be a best movie or award winning, but it is thought and emotion provoking, causing me to reflect upon people I've known in my life and what their own stories might be.  Being a research-historian, I am drawn to such things anyway... I can relate to Julia's interest/obsession.  This will explain why I feel, even in a small way, connected to the story.

I found ""Sarah's Key"" to be predictable.  After the first 15 minutes I voiced my prediction about the film's ending (to my son, out-loud), and an hour-and-a-half later I was proven 90% right.

I found uninspired and uninspiring similarities of this film to the 1982 ""Sophie's Choice""by Alan Pakula, or 2010 ""Joanna"" by Feliks Falk (both better movies).

The acting is over-done, over the top.  There are some naive and illogical scenes, over-dramatized.

The always-wonderful Kristin Scott Thomas is featured as a modern day reporter who researches a story about Jews who were rounded up in Paris in the early part of the Nazi's control and extinction.  As good as Scott-Thomas is, her ""story"" is a small and comparatively unimportant one compared to the portions set 70 years ago.  Meryl Streep's recent ""The Iron Lady"" was all but ruined (in my opinion, as Streep won the Academy Award) by the flashback sequences between the later years Margaret Thatcher - who was senile and feeble - and the earlier, robust Dame Thatcher who rose from plain beginnings to be prime minister.)  So it is in ""Sarah's Key"" - sticking to the Holocaust story would have made a stronger, shorter, movie.  It is important, as Holocaust ""deniers"" unintentionally remind us, that we NOT forget the atrocities of history lest they be repeated - and to honor the victims.

I agree with another reviewer that said this should have been two movies, or better yet just one war era.  Isn't there enough contrived, sappy, predictable love stories on lifetime???

 I was extremely annoyed when Richard Rainsferd, who is dying of cancer, rips off his oxygen mask and proceeds to sit on the side of the bed.  Also, another irksome bit was that Julia is seen getting out of the American Driver's side seat.  The acting of William Rainsferd was by far the most unrealistic.

6235905,4,B005SOH84O,"It has been some time since I read the book, Sarah's key, which I reviewed here on Amazon. So long ago, in fact, I'd have a hard time saying for sure if the movie is ""true"" to the book. I need to re-read. But it wasn't a book I was planning on revisiting anytime soon, since it was so very heart-breakingly sad. Well, the movie is very much in the same vein--very sad, very emotional.

Kristen Scott Thomas is VERY good. She is definitely the stand out in this film, and really, besides Sarah, the main character, the plot revolves around her and her discoveries. At a difficult crossroads in her life and her marriage, she and her husband are about to remodel and move into the apartment her husbands parents purchased during the war in Paris. A journalist, Julia learns there was a large round up of Jews in the occupied city during the war that no one even seems to know about. And then she learns even more disturbing news about their ""new"" apartment.

This film was very beautiful, the scenery was breathtaking. The young woman who plays an young adult Sarah Starzynski, Charlotte Poutrel is gorgeous, quietly mysterious and sad. The young actress who plays Sarah as a child is phenomenal: the role is nuanced and Mlusine Mayance is extraordinary in dragging you along on her journey and quest, reluctantly, as you know it will come to no good end.

I almost didn't watch it, as there are some films and books, that while fictional, touch such a sorrowful place in me. But this film was very well done. I also really loved the actors who played the Dufaure couple, the farmers that help and hide Sarah after she escapes from the camp, Niels Arestrup and Dominique Frot--they were most endearing. Seeing Aidan Quinn as an aolder much heavier man was a  shock, but his appearnace suited his role as Sarah's son in the film. This is a great movie for a rainy day.

I was especially impressed by the performance of Melusine, who creates a completely believable character, while acting with poise and nuance that I wouldn't have thought possible at her age.  I felt all through the movie that the filmmakers were treating their characters and their subject matter with dignity and compassion--this was an aspect of WWII with which I had been only passingly familiar, and I'm glad that I learned about it this way.  I'm very glad that French filmmakers made this--Hollywood would have tried to wrap it all up in a neat little package with a ""satisfying"" ending that resolved all of the conflicts of all of the characters, and they wouldn't have allowed so much to go unsaid that truly needs to go unsaid.  We don't need to know why someone doesn't want to talk of why the main character flies to New York--there are enough clues in the movie so that we can figure it out ourselves; besides, often people in real life do things we don't expect or things that surprise us.

This was a very emotional journey that doesn't manipulate our emotions, and a tense drama that kept me riveted the entire time.  Likeable characters who do the best they can during difficult times and a difficult subject make for one of the better films that I've seen in a while.",1335657600,,1359,4.684873949579832
6235909,4,B005SOH84O,"This overlooked gem of a film begins with American journalist Julia Jarmond (the always impeccable Kristin Scott Thomas) searching for information about French Jews captured during WW II.  She is married to a career focused Frenchman.  They are about to move into a new apartment in Paris.  She learns that there is a history with the apartment which was given to the couple by Julia's father-in-law.

Through internet information, visits to encampment sites and personal interviews she begins to uncover secrets of what was known as the Vel d'Hiv round-up.  This was not a Nazi orchestrated maneuver but one instituted by the French.  Many Frenchmen believed that imprisoning Jews would save their own hides.  The French would like to ignore this terrible event.  Julia begins to focus on one 10 year old girl named Sarah.  In a haunting performance by Melusine Mayance, Sarah is the lone survivor of her family that was rousted from the apartment 60 years earlier. The apartment that Julia will soon occupy.

The film flashes back and forth between the current day investigation and 1942 when the horrible incident occurred.  Sarah carries with her a tremendous burden involving her 4 year old brother as the film moves into the 1960's.  The final act does moves away from the mystery and horror as Julia locates descendents of Sarah and her family.  A bit melodramatic toward the end?  Sure, but it felt somewhat earned as release from the pit-in-stomach feeling that had been built up.  A very good movie.

Scott Thomas not only performs the film with her accomplished French but a damn good American accent as well.  The movie is in French and English with subtitles.  The Blu ray disc has a beautiful 1080p transfer and captures the original aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  There is very little guessing as to which time period you're seeing as the look is much different.  The more somber greyish and browns play during the 1942 period.  The current period involves more color and brightness.  The Blu ray is excellent in highlighting the differences.

6235913,2,B005SOH84O,"The makers of Sarah's Key have attempted to weld a grim, powerful Vichy story with a present-day NYC love story.  They failed.

In place of what should have been two separate movies we have this.  A compelling and well-acted WWII story intersperses (as is the directing fashion of the day) with flash-forwards depicting the decades-later collateral fall-out on the family and the ones who came after.  My gripes are with the unexplained motivations of key characters: Why did Sarah kill herself 20 years later? Hadn't she come to the states to begin anew? What about the poor truck driver? And on and on.

Then we have Thomas's character and her marital discord. It really stretches credulity to cast her as a new mother, doesn't it? What?!? At least she has stopped her trademark excuses for acting: eye-rolling and making funny faces. Then, toward the end, Quinn appears with his jarring, mumbling screen presence, grinding the movie to a complete halt. He actually apologizes to viewers for his poundage!

I saw the movie on DVD in French with English subtitles because I enjoy getting the feel for the actual language spoken as opposed to a dubbed movie and I was appalled by the pathetic mistranslations from French to English.  Many of the English sentences make no sense at all.

It's disgraceful to release a major movie like this and not have a competent English speaker check that the English captions are correct.  Was this the work of Google Translate? How much of an investment can that be compared to the overall budget for the movie?",1333929600,,647,4.504273504273504

Beautiful scenes remain with me (the soldier with his boot on Sarah's apple, the children under the covers in bed, Sarah and her friend running through the field and floating in the water)... as do some horrific, realistic representations (the stadium scenes of the Jews captivity) of this ultimately depressing story.

Quality of filming aside, it was hard to suspend disbelief as the stories of Sarah and Julia played out, and I felt the end of the movie played ""catch-up"" to bring us to the conclusion. I have not read the book, so I don't know if the film adaptation is weak due to being rushed, or if the original work had the same issue... but I was left with a feeling of, ""Oh, RIGHT. That's just TOO coincidental,"" as the movie ended.

I am glad I saw the film, and I learned a tremendous amount about the French Vl d'Hiver Roundup - the realism of the portrayal of what the Jews endured made me cringe and at one point turn away. However, this movie is one I don't ever want to see again, due exactly to those realistic scenes of the atrocities which the Jews suffered.

I would recommend it to those interested in this time in history, and fans of Kristin Scott Thomas, but not to those easily unnerved by the subject matter, as it is very VIVID in images of familial separation, longing and regret, and physical shame.

6235917,4,B005SOH84O,"Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) is an American journalist with a new newsmagazine that finds herself involved in a story that connects to her present day life and husband's family. The story moves comfortably back and forth between the past and present as it unfolds telling a dramatic and tragic story.

Sarah Starzynski was a young French Jew during WWII. As the Jews in Paris are being rounded up, she tells her brother to hide in the secret closet and not to let anyone know he is there, locking the door behind her. What she doesn't realize is that this is not a few hours away trip but a transport of Jews to the camps. Unable to leave to release her brother, she searches for a way out.

Relocated to a velodrome with no bathrooms and horror inducing conditions, the family is finally taken to trains and unable to rescue their son. But Sarah never gives up hope, holding tightly to the key in her possession.

Each step of her trip is followed by Julia in the present as she searches for answers of what happened to the young girl. It becomes even more personal when she finds that the new building she and her husband are renovating is one that's been owned by the family since as far back as the war. Could they have known what became of the boy? Or of Sarah? Julia continues to search for answers, feeling a connection by being in the same apartment.

The story follows Sarah as she and her family are separated in the camps. Few people realize that the Germans were not the only ones to have taken unkindly to the Jews during the war. In an attempt to placate the Germans, many French involved themselves in these roundups as well. It is only in recent years their involvement has been made more public.

In the camp Sarah continues to hold on to hope (and her key) that her brother is still out there and safe. If only she could reach him. With nothing to lose, she plans an escape and a way back to Paris. This would be an incredible task for anyone but even more so for Sarah who is only around 10 years old.

Julia continues to learn more about the apartment and about Sarah. And the more she learns the more she yearns to know what happened. Things between her and her husband become strained. She questions his family about what they knew. And by the end of the film we too will learn what became of Sarah and her brother.

While the movie is about a horrifying experience and piece of history, it never plays it for the cheap thrill. The suicide of one woman in the velodrome is the worst it gets, but you know what's going to happen to these people. The interweaving of the two stories is well handled and the acting makes you feel that these people are truly going through the ordeals they find themselves in past and present.

SARAH'S KEY is a timely story, especially when one witnesses the anti-Semitic remarks hurled during the latest Occupy Wall Street protests. It is a lesson we should have learned by now but apparently haven't. And perhaps that makes this movie one that should be seen today. A touching drama, a superb story and well made film that is worth the rental price.",1332806400,,3111,4.436077057793345
6235918,4,B005SOH84O,"A fictionalized, but emotionally powerful drama about a young Jewish girl, Sarah, who was one of 13,000 Jewish emigrants and refugees rounded up by the French police in German-occupied Paris and shipped to Auschwitz. A present day American journalist Julia, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, attempts to unravel events of the past. The film alternates between the past and the present, relating both the ordeal of 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski and that of the present day journalist attempting to find out what happened to Sarah, who Julia knows was not killed at Auschwitz. Intertwined with Sarah's story is a portrait of middle-aged Julia's struggle with her desire to carry to term a ""surprise"" pregnancy that her husband does not want. Several reviewers felt that ""the angst of modern life over-shadows past tragedy"". Granted that Sarah's story (the first two thirds of the movie) is stronger than Julia's (the last third), but I feel that the intertwining of the stories lends strength to the movie. The first part of the film, which focuses on the young Sarah, is unbelievable good (I give it a 5). The second part is about a 3.5.

This is not just another holocaust movie, of which there have been so many that they are beginning to lose their impact, but a film focused on the tribulations of two strong-willed, courageous women, a rarity in modern action films. The performances by Kristin Scott Thomas and especially Melusine Mayance (as the young Sarah) will keep you on the edge of your seat. Kristin Scott Thomas received a Csar Award nomination for her compelling performance in this role. I think the performance by Mayance as Sarah is the best I have seen by a young actor.

6235919,4,B005SOH84O,"I haven't read the book Sarah's Key, which I thought was worth noting before I started my review. I wasn't expecting Sarah's Key to be as intense as it was since the synopsis didn't include anything about the Holocaust. While the movie's serious subject matter will be offsetting to some, it really was an enjoyable film.

Kristen Scott Thomas makes the film. I hadn't heard of this film at all before it arrived at my house so I was worried that it might just be one of those movies that really isn't all that different from a Lifetime original movie. But Kristen Scott Thomas gives a believable performance that comes across as genuine rather than melodramatic. I was actually sad to see her role diminish as the movie progressed.

I have the film four stars rather than five because I thought that the flashback scenes could've been integrated into the movie in a more professional fashion than they were. I understand that the movie was trying to follow the book, but it felt weird that the movie spent so much time at once on the flashback moments. Kristen Scott Thomas is supposed to be the lead and her relationship with the reader is challenged once she basically disappears as the flashbacks begin.

I enjoyed Sarah's Key, but I don't know if it has a lot of mainstream appeal. Those with personal connections to the story will be pleased with it, but I don't know if the typical American would. There are plenty of good movies out there, I don't know if Sarah's Key stands out enough to captivate the interest of people who either haven't read the book or don't have emotional ties.",1332633600,,1592,4.618374558303887
6235920,5,B005SOH84O,"Other reviewers have covered the plot of Sarah's Key admirably, and commented on the differences between the book and the movie. I simply want to concur with the sentiments of several reviewers who have said that this is an outstanding film on a subject of great importance. The marketing dollars and special effects budgets spent on Hollywood fare are largely wasted; the productions are ephemeral and insignificant, pablum for the brain at best and a waste of precious minutes at worst. Sarah's Key, in contrast, is worth every moment of attention. The acting, script, camerawork and direction are all top-form. The subject matter is painful, disturbing, uncomfortable - and essential.

Humanity is, at times, bestial. At times of disruption (war, revolution) the weak, the cunning, the ruthless and the amoral all rise to power and for some time lord it over ordinary people whose very tendency to keep their heads down, hope for the best, and not stand up against injustice means that inevitably they will be sheep to the slaughter-house. In Sarah's Key we see vividly how ordinary French people enthusiastically collaborated with the Nazi occupiers to rid France of its Jewish citizens. The French, naturally, prefer to forget this moment in their history - but forgetting merely makes it all the easier for such horrors to recur at a later date. And we must understand, each one of us, that every country, every race, every people at every time is susceptible to such horrors. All it takes is a little social disruption and a powerful voice saying ""do this"" and we, the consumate herd animal, will obey. We will wreak harm on our neighbors. The insecure, the repressed, the bitter, the uneducated, the dregs - they will rise and assume power and everyone else will fall meekly into line. Unless we remember, and very early in the process stand against such things. Movies like Sarah's Key remind generations who were born after World War II that life is more complex and more dark than Disney would have us believe, and we need to pay attention to what's going on around us if we're not to wake up and realize we ourselves participated in a horror.

If you need a history lesson, Sarah's Key is a great way to begin.",1332633600,,2222,4.829396325459317

Mildly, generally the books blow the movies out of the water and so if I couldn't get through the book what could the movie hold for me? On a whim I gave it a shot. I am glad I did. So very glad.

This movie is powerful, the acting is done very well, and the movement between time periods is not jolting. I even appreciated having to read some parts of the movie. I say some becuase not all of it is in French and the fact that about 3/4 of the movie is in French made it all the more authentic.

6235945,3,B005SOH84O,"This big screen adaptation of Tatiana De Rosnay's novel ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sarah-s-Key/dp/B005B19UPE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sarah's Key</a>,"" directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner in some way presents the Holocaust awareness message with greater simplicity and impact than its written counterpart.  However, sadly, both the novel and the film's major plot line of Sarah and her key is rectified around the halfway mark of both pieces. As the murkier central story of a journalist whose marital issues and unplanned pregnancy shifts the mass horror of the Vel D'Hiv roundup into the smaller arena of moving past personal tragedy, the significance of the message seems less intense, diluted by one woman's trouble and some trite classroom telling instead of being the sole monumentally emotional grab of the piece. In that sense, the incident seems marginalized in the face of smaller personal issues that effect a few not thousands.

Not that the overall feeling of the film is any different from the book.  The fact that over 80,000 Jews were ultimately deported to death camps by French authorities during Marshal Petain's Vichy Government is depicted with a heart-wrenching simplicity as seen through the frightened and cowed eyes of the determined ten-year-old Sarah Starzinsky played with precocious perfection by Mlusine Mayance.  Discovering these more personal events triggered by the Vel D'Hiv roundup of 1942 from the vantage point of the present day is Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) who brings her unflappable perseverance to uncovering the details of a disturbing story to light despite the reluctance and ambivalence of others who feel the story might well be best forgotten.

Is Julia just a hysterical woman flooded with pregnancy hormones and angst regarding her marriage that she simply must see the Sarah story to its endpoint?

Writers Serge Joncour and Gilles Paquet-Brenner segue from the past to the present with ease, weaving the atrocities of the past within the arena of guilt and discomfort that defines home for their Julia.  Following the book closely, they report Sarah's story adequately, but fall short when the titular key unlocks the door in the wall and quite frankly, there is no where to go from that point on to balance the emotional drain.  Thankfully, this writing team decides not to pursue the romantic entanglement in which the novel's Julia eventually indulges.  The addition of the William character in De Rosnay's universe seems an attempt to add some yang to all the yin--the idea of having Julia bank her future happiness on Sarah's only son smacks of a contrivance that has no place in a story of such devastating emotional intensity.

Let's face it, the only event that could have turned the tale around and brought out a bright smile and a few tears for theatregoers would have been a complete rewriting of the outcome.  Sarah rushes to the cabinet and unlocks the door--or, more practically, Jules and his wife take charge as adults would and move the poor girl out of harm's way so they could open what could well be the macabre sight of the boy's crypt.  As the door swings open, surprise--no one is there.  The emptiness suggests another mystery--where is the child?  Who took him? All of this could have flowed into the present story very nicely and provided the intrepid Julia with a flicker of hope, that she could fan into a huge magazine human-interest feature.

Bottom line? Paquet-Brenner's adaptation of ""Sarah's Key"" by Tatiana De Rosnay follows the plot of the book faithfully for those who are devoted fans.  Young actress Mlusine Mayance and Kristin Scott Thomas as the two leads add solemnity and stellar acting to a story that because it hinges off a devastating negative event that is never balanced by one of equal positive power, it fails to emotionally satisfy.  Thankfully, Paquet-Brenner leaves out De Rosnay's contrived ending allowing the overall Holocaust awareness message first and foremost despite weighing against one of the main character's personal problems.

6235947,5,B005SOH84O,"Kristen Scott Thomas, as a modern-day journalist, researches the WWII story of Jewish families who were evicted from their homes in Paris, brutally herded into the Velodrome and ultimately sent to German concentration camps.

As her story unfolds, the journalist begins to suspect there's a link between the Paris apartment her husband's family owns and has passed down to them, and the story of one of these Jewish families. Her research suddenly becomes urgent and very personal. What she discovers could cause her marriage to unravel. The story hinges on an old key and a girl who desperately wants to find her brother.

This is a riveting film. The viewer is spared any scenes of these families' horrible fates, but the anguished scenes of children being ripped from their parents, and husbands from wives, is heartbreaking. I often find that movies that go back and forth between generations don't work -- that you're interested in one story but not the other -- but this one works on all levels.

6235950,4,B005SOH84O,"I have long had a fascination for Nazi atrocities and the Holocaust in particular.  I believe that the subject should not be forgotten and that the more one knows about the horrors that were inflicted upon the European population during World War II, the more one can educate those who have not learned enough about it, or have chosen to ignore it.  My DVD collection includes a large number of documentaries concerning the Holocaust, as well as many dramas that are based on historical facts surrounding the subject.  So, when Amazon Vine offered me a copy of Sarah's Key, I knew this film would fit right in.

Sarah's key concerns a French journalist named Julia, who is assigned to do a story on the 1942 deportation of thousands of French Jews to Nazi concentration camps.  Coincidentally, she is in the process of moving with her husband into her father-in-law's childhood apartment, and she stumbles upon information that the home was previously occupied by the Jewish Straznski family, who were among those forcibly evicted and sent to the camps.  Fascinated by this information, she begins to uncover more details about the family whose life her future father-in-law and his family supplanted.

The shameful deportation from Paris was handled by the French police, who sheepishly took orders from the Nazi killers to round up the Jews.  The most affecting and painful moments in the film are the horrible conditions endured by the deportees as they await transfer to the camps.  Held in a stadium without food, water, adequate plumbing or any comfortable way to sleep, the families endure their misery in ways that will thaw the heart and amaze the observer, especially those who are used to the most modern comforts and conveniences.  At the center of the story is a young girl named Sarah, who hides her little brother in a locked closet to escape the Nazis, thinking the family will be returning shortly.  Although their plight is clearly precarious and their danger extreme, all her thought are directed at the idea of returning home to free her brother from the closet.  When she does escape and tries to rescue him, the tragic results are some of the most heartbreaking moments in the film.

There is an additional twist involving Julia's attempt to find the grown Sarah, and the effects on Sarah's offspring, but I would recommend anyone whose interest has been held thus far to see the film and discover these aspects for themselves.  While some of the drama involved is relegated to what has become standard Holocaust fare, there are enough personal touches and little known historic facts to make Sarah's key a worthy entry in the crowded canon of Holocaust dramas.

6235951,5,B005SOH84O,"This movie was a successful effort to connect the pain and suffering of the Holocaust to a non-Jewish contemporary person.  In Sarah's Key, a successful journalist becomes entwined in the story and suffering of the holocaust by virtue of her family moving into an apartment that was formerly the home of Jewish tenants in 1942.  These tenants were taken by force and moved first to a stadium for staging, then to a holding camp and finally to a death camp.  The journalist's father-in-law grew up in the apartment and a secret has been kept about what exactly happened when the Jewish family was taken from their home.  The journalist, originally working on the story about French police assisting Nazi occupiers, becomes personally involved when she discovers that a young girl living in the apartment may still be alive.  It becomes her mission to find her and talk to her.  The journalist seems to be looking for some redemption or reconciliation for her family for any abetting that her extended family may have been involved in.  The director deftly flashes back to the historical incidents, from the ouster of the family to their terrible journey to the various camps.  While pursing this project, the journalist discovers she is pregnant.  Her husband, who is middle aged and at a key point in his career, finds the pregnancy terribly inconvenient and wants the wife to abort.  This conflict over life vs. abortion is thus juxtaposed and serves as a background tension to the issues of life and death attached to the story of the Jewish family and the little girl in that family, Sarah.  The film is enveloped in drama that deals with issues of life and death, reconciliation and redemption as well as sacrifice and risk.  It is well worth watching to experience how these issues can come to the fore in various events, both personal and historical.",1328227200,,1856,4.8386075949367084

This is a fictional story based on the real events during the round-up of Jews in France during the Nazi occupation of WW II.  In a way it covers a lot of the same ground as Schindler's List from a few years ago.  However, while Schindler's List told an actual story about the real people involved, Sarah's Key is a much more personal story about one fictional girl and what happened to her and her family.  Of course, it's an allegory about what was actually happening to real people at the time.  However, because it is such a personal story about one girl's experiences, it carries much more of an emotional impact than I got from watching Schindler's List.  That's what makes this movie such a great story - emotional resonance.  I think most of the other reviews here are also five stars - and that's what this should be.  This is just great movie making and great story telling.  Highly recommended.",1327536000,,1045,4.51595744680851
6235954,3,B005SOH84O,"A 2010 French drama ""Sarah's Key"" (""Elle s'appelait Sarah"") has two stories to tell, one about a 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski (Mlusine Mayance), who hides her younger brother Michel in a secret closet on 16 July, 1942, when Paris police arrested the Jewish population at the orders of the Nazis. Before they are transported by the police, Sarah locks the door, not knowing that she may not be able to come back here again.

The other story, set in 2009, is about an American journalist Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas), who, after inheriting the apartment Sarah lived in (the fact Julia does not know), starts investigating the truths about the events that happened about 67 years ago.

Based on Tatiana De Rosnay's book of the same title (which I haven't read), ""Sarah's Key"" employs a double narrative in which the story goes back and forth in time, and like most double narrative structure, one half of the film is less interesting than the other. I don't think we need the story of Julia, a character we really don't care, despite Kristin Scott Thomas's fine acting for which she was nominated for Csar.

The real star, or I should say heroine, of the film is Mlusine Mayance playing young Sarah, who has to go through grueling hardships to keep her promise with her little brother. Unfortunately she exits the story a bit too early, and the film slowly loses momentum after that. Why didn't filmmakers focus one story instead of two when they should have known that the film is ""Sarah's Key,"" not ""Julia's""?

6235959,3,B005SOH84O,"I will not go into the description of the movie since there are plenty of reviews here that do, and there's always the Amazon description. WARNING: there may be some spoilers here.

I loved Sarah's Key the book, and was eager to see the movie. While the screen version was powerful and mostly well cast, it does not compare favorably to the book. I watched it with a few friends who have not read book, and they were confused by the movie to say the least. I was constantly filling in the story for them and explaining who everybody was. I think that midway through the movie they finally become more invested in the events, but it took a lot of work on my part to get them there.

The movie moved too fast without much background information on the characters or the surrounding events. From my friends' point of view - they did not readily understand the Tezac family connections (I had to say ""that's the grandmother in law, that's her husband, etc.), did not see how Sarah's story tied in, etc. The scenes switched so quickly that it was easy to miss the French involvement in Vel d'Hiv or fully comprehend where Jewish people were being taken. It was even hard to know that at one point Julia was in a clinic planning to get an abortion - the movie just showed her in a room taking a call. These are just some of the things that were poorly explained, but there were many more.

One thing that bothered me was how minimal a role Julia's husband, Betrand, played in the movie. In the book, he was described as being dashing, charming and at times very mean in his relationship with Julia. In the movie, he was disheveled at best and only appeared a handful at times. It was impossible to truly understand their relationship from those few scenes.

Overall, I think that those that have read the book might enjoy seeing it on screen and will be able to fill in missed details. Others will need to pay very careful attention to keep up.",1326585600,2,1938,4.420168067226891

Unfortunately the English is not and this is a great irritant. Scott Thomas speaks both French and American English and hops about between the two. As French is dominant one tends to rely on the subtitles and every now and then they are not there and one realises she has just said some words in English. The dialogue is not always 100% clear and one has to fiddle with the volume control and of course if one is hard of hearing part of the dialogue is then missed. This is a stupid and very annoying fault. The UK disc is the same. This disc is not cheap and I suggest a rent as I found this dialogue defect too troublesome to want to watch it again.

6235963,5,B005SOH84O,"This film left me emotionally exhausted but hopeful because it portrays the worst of people and the best of people. At first, I found myself enraged at the French collaboration with the Nazis. In Paris, when Jewish families were separated, mothers from children, it was the French soldiers who pulled them apart. Later it was a French soldier who allowed Sarah and her friend to escape under the wire. The poor girl who had hidden her brother in a closet and locked it against the Nazi soldiers, never gave up the idea that she could go back and save him. Fifty years later an American wife of a Frenchman realizes that the family apartment that they will inherit from her husband's family, was part of the ghetto of Paris. She investigates further and finds the name of Sarah's family, its former inhabitants. Thanks to the meticulous record keeping of the Germans she realizes that Sarah and her brother never went to Auschwitz with their parents. She also finds that Sarah moved to the United States. Never giving up on finding Sarah, she also realizes that she is pregnant, something that she had given up on after miscarriages followed the birth of her only child. Her husband does not want another child when their daughter is now a teenager. So this is another conflict in her life. The movie covers a huge time frame but does it well, showing the hardships of World War Two against the realities of present day and how we face the same choices in our lives.",1326412800,,1465,4.638461538461539
6235964,5,B005SOH84O,"Two things make this film unique for me.  The first is that it examines the willing culpability of a group separate from the Nazis - in this case, the French government.  The suffering the French government inflicted upon its own citizens - all in the name of ethnic cleansing - is shocking, heartbreaking and all too-familiarly horrifying in its execution.  Sadly the French were far from alone in such actions.

However, the most important point that this film illustrates is the post-traumatic aftermath of such human suffering. Despite the loving support of her adopted French family and the subsequent love of a caring, doting husband and precious son, Sarah could not overcome or come to terms with the pain and loss she endured during the Holocaust.  Like with the brilliant and prolific, Primo Levi, the horror of those experiences was simply too much to bear.

The film is wonderful in the telling of the story and its current-day impact on those who previously felt they had no connection with those events of 60+ years ago.  But, ultimately, it's Sarah's story: of loss, of attempted rebuilding and ultimate self-sacrifice in the face of such overwhelming trauma.  It is not an uncommon story in Holocaust history, but one which rarely gets addressed.  Here, it is done with courage and thoughtfulness.",1326067200,2,1313,4.986238532110092

6235987,5,B005SOH84O,"In mid 1942 the French - doubtless under pressure from the Germans - arrested thousands of Jews in the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup and sent them to a huge camp - the Velodrome - preparatory to being sent to concentration camps. The movie begins with Sarah Starzynski's family being rounded up. She locks her little brother in a closet and tells him to be quiet. And then, when she learns that they are not going back she becomes frantic with worry and tries desperately to come back and rescue him.

The movie moves on two tracks. In one, we see the travails of Sarah, her attempts to get back and rescue her little brother and what happens to her subsequently.

In the other Julia, a reporter played by Kristin Scott Thomas, discovers that her husband's grandfather took over a beautiful apartment in Paris that was once owned by a Jewish family sent to the camps. That family was Sarah's. Julis, driven by a curiosity that does not let her be, digs really deep to find out what happened to Sarah. This quest ruins her marriage and causes other upsets in her life.

Eventually the two threads do meet in a most unexpected way but I will not spoil it for you by saying how.

The acting and directing are both memorable and you get a real feel for what it was like to be under Nazi control if you were a Jew. There are many poignant moments such as when Sarah recognizes one of the guards at the Velodrome as a neighboring youth she knew and tries to shake his hand with a quivering introduction.

This represents yet another remarkable testament to the powers of evil and good in a dreadful situation.

The story of a young girl, and her struggles through the Holocaust, with a dreadful added twist. The story is presented in an interesting manner using a modern, parallel storyline.

6235990,3,B005SOH84O,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Sarah's Key features two alternating stories initially set in Paris, one concerning the fate of Sarah, a 10 year old Jewish girl and her family during the Nazi occupation in 1942 and another set in 2009 involving Julia, an American born French journalist, who has been researching the infamous Velodrome d'Hiver incident--a bicycle arena where thousands of French Jews were interned in squalid conditions after being rounded up by the French police upon orders of the Nazis.

When Julia discovers that the apartment she and her French born husband are about to move into, bequeathed to them by her husband's family, is the same apartment that belonged to a Jewish family that had been deported, her interest in the fate of French Jewry in World War II becomes personal--something much more than just one of her journalistic assignments. Before you know it, she pays a call to an expert Holocaust researcher who is able to provide her with the names of the deported family, which includes Sarah and her younger brother.

Perhaps the most gripping scenes in 'Sarah's Key' involve the deportation of the Jews during the infamous Parisian roundup. The horror is first aptly conveyed in the mother's panicked reaction to the French policeman's orders for everyone in the household to leave (including the children). As the police look for the husband (who is soon to be arrested when he returns home, unaware that the police have arrived), the two children sneak off into another room. Sarah inexplicably locks her younger brother in a closet and keeps the key, expecting soon to return and free him. Things get worse for the family when they're shipped to the Velodrome and they're forced to remain there for days on end, without toilets and in stifling heat. Frightened adults as well as children witness multiple suicides, as despairing deportees jump from the rafters. When the victims are transported to relocation camps, the full horror is conveyed when the parents are separated from their children and are driven off in trucks to death camps.

Like many comparable films created by German filmmakers, the scenarists appear to be ambivalent on the subject of homegrown complicity in the Holocaust. One scene illustrates this ambivalence--as the Jews are being deported, one French woman calls out from the window of her apartment, in substance, that the Jews are getting what's coming to them. But another man, in another apartment, yells to the woman, 'they'll come for you next'. Similarly, the villainous French police have one good apple amongst their ranks--the one who allows Sarah and her soon to be dying friend, to crawl under the barbed wire and make their escape from the relocation camp. And yes, there's even a quid pro quo when it comes to villagers: before taken in by the kindly couple, there was that gruff, homeowner who sends the children away without helping them. By mainly focusing on the 'righteous gentile' couple who saves Sarah, the film's scenarists may be giving the wrong impression that there was a equal balance between the bad and the good. In reality, the 'helpers' were few and far between, in occupied France.

While it was a bit of a stretch to accept the whole idea that Julia, a person who had already been researching Holocaust history in her job as a journalist, was now directly connected to a horror story involving her husband's family's apartment, the horror story itself proves to be far more contrived. I'm speaking of the whole idea of the kindly husband and wife who who decide to take Sarah back to the apartment to discover the fate of her brother. First of all, the husband wouldn't have had any trouble concluding that the child was dead already if he was still in the closet. So why would he allow Sarah to go up and open the closet, subjecting her to a trauma that haunted her for the rest of her life (until her suicide in 1955). Even more unconvincing is the idea that the husband and wife would have actually brought Sarah along to investigate what happened to the brother. How could they be so sure that the bribe would work when they were on the train? All the husband had to do was make the trip to Paris himself, bring the key and ask the new owner (Julia's husband's grandfather) to open the closet. As Sarah's discovery of her dead brother in the closet is the key moment in the film, and the events leading up to that moment are wholly implausible, the overall impact of the film is diminished.

Events depicted in the present day also tend to lessen the film's overall impact. Should we really care about Julia's fight with her husband over whether she should keep the baby? Perhaps if the husband was a more fleshed out character, the interaction between the two of them would have been more compelling.

Finally, 'Sarah's Key' asks the question, ""what would you have done?"" had you been under the yoke of Nazi occupation. It's instructive to compare the French and Danes during World War II. Denmark initially faced a much more benign occupation than France--the Nazis allowed them self-government and did not challenge them when they refused to enact laws against the Jews. But when the Nazis changed course in 1943 in Denmark, and a reign of terror did begin (similar to what happened in France), the Danes arranged for their Jewish population to escape by boat to neutral Sweden. In France, due to widespread anti-Semitism, there was little sympathy for the Jews to begin with and no such collective will emerged. The filmmaker's, however, hint that the majority had no choice to act otherwise against the Nazis.

'Sarah's Key' does have some affecting moments particularly in its scenes involving the deportation of French Jews, but the film's central dramatic moment is too contrived to be believable.",1325376000,2,5817,4.856854838709677
6235991,5,B005SOH84O,"SARAH'S KEY, novel:Tatiana de Rosnay, film:Gilles Paquel-Brenner

The best plot summary of this film are words taken from a starred review by Publishers Weekly of the novel appearing on the Metacritic internet site:  ""Julia Jarmond, an American journalist married to a Frenchman, is commissioned to write an article about the notorious Vel d'Hiv round up, which took place in Paris in 1942. She stumbles upon a family secret which will link her forever to the destiny of a young Jewish girl, Sarah. Julia learns that the apartment she and her husband Bertrand plan to move into was acquired by Bertrand's family when its Jewish occupants were dispossessed and deported... She resolves to find out what happened to the former occupants: Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski, parents of 10-year-old Sarah and four-year-old Michel. The more Julia discovers - especially about Sarah, the only member of the Starzynski family to survive - the more she uncovers about Bertrand's family, about France and, finally, herself.""

This is a French film that stars the acclaimed actress Kristin Scott Thomas as the journalist, a wonderful and versatile Mlusine Mayance as the young Sarah, Niels Arestrup as the farmer who hides Sarah from the Germans, Frdric Pierrot as Jarmond's husband, and American actor Aiden Quinn in a small but stellar role in the last third of the film.  Although it is a Holocaust movie, there are very few graphic scenes and several glimpses of happier days: young Sarah playing on the bed with her brother in the Marais apartment; Sarah and another girl ripping the Star of David from their clothing, frolicking in a field of wheat, and bathing in a muddy river after their escape from a detainee camp; the two young girls sleeping in a farmer's barn with his guard dog.

The true star (or villain) of the film is the Velodrome d'Hiver, an indoor bicyle track and sports stadium which was located in Paris near the Eiffel Tower. Built for the World's Fair in 1900, the small track was enlarged and moved several blocks farther away from the Tower to house events for the 1924 Summer Olympics. Damaged by fire in 1959 and demolished, the glass-topped structure was reconstructed for the movie by its crew. A bonus feature of the DVD shows the amazing reconstruction.

Of the 28,000 Jews deported from Paris and Northern France by French police at the request of German occupiers, 13,152 men, women and children were placed in the Vel d'Hiv in July of 1942 for eight days. No toilet access and little food or water was available...and the comparison to the New Orleans Superdome catastrophe is drawn early in the film. (The film's modern-day action is updated to 2009 to allow this comparison.)

This DVD is the film with English subtitles that had a limited USA release in July of 2011 to be touted as an Oscar 2012 contender. I had hesistated to rent a DVD with subtitles...but about a third of the film (the modern-day events) is in English...and the transition is smooth and not disruptive. From other Amazon reviews, it appears that the film closely follows the novel. Tatiana de Rosnay collaborated with Director Paquel-Brenner who wrote the screenplay.

Why put money into something as fabulous as Sarah's Key when you can put together a remake of a classic for only $200,000,000? We need more 3D. Forget the plot, they'll never notice!! 3D is the answer. Mr. Depp, put on your pirate uniform!

Before the French officials forced them out, Sarah was able to hide her little brother in a locked, concealed closet. When it becomes apparent the family will not be returning home, Sarah's desperation to rescue her brother mounts, and she does everything in her power to get to him.

When American journalist Julia (Kristin Scott Thomas) and her French husband begin renovating his family's Paris apartment, Julia learns that the former occupants were part of the 1942. Finding out what happened to Sarah becomes a driving force in her life, and Julia soon uncovers long-hidden family secrets.

My take: I generally enjoy World War II movies, so I jumped at the chance to review ""Sarah's Key."" I didn't realize it was a French movie, though (perhaps I should have read the description better!)--so I'm glad I recently got a larger TV, which made reading the subtitles easier!

I really liked this film. The fact that it cut back and forth between Sarah's and Julia's stories kept it from getting too heavy. I also appreciated that the filmmakers chose not to go for the ""gross out"" factor in one pivotal scene. Rather than showing a grotesque, decomposing body, they focused on the characters in the scene, which I think made a more powerful impact than showing the body would have.

Several fantastic performances really carry this film. Kristin Scott Thomas is great as usual, but the two performances that stick out to me are Niels Arestrup as a Frenchman who takes Sarah under his wing and M&eacute;lusine Mayance as the young Sarah. Mayance in particular is phenomenal, as she completely sells Sarah's horror, determination, and pain.

Also of interest is a ""making of"" special on the DVD, which features interviews with the film's director (who claims Mayance is one of the best actresses he's ever worked with) and Tatiana De Rosnay (the author of the book Sarah's Key), as well as a look at the special effects/stunts and the history behind the story.

Without giving away what happens, all I can say is the first half of the movie is well made and emotionally stirring -- it's a Holocaust story and the movie has a great cast. Unfortunately, the main character, a journalist, is less and less believable and likable as the movie progresses. There are some completely unnecessary scenes in which she is looking for lost family members but not finding them -- why are we looking at perfect strangers opening their doors and shaking their heads? Couldn't the director think of anything else to fill out the story with? It goes downhill from there -- the last third of the movie is poorly written, poorly directed and poorly acted.

6236009,5,B005SOH84O,"It should not be necessary to recapitulate the plot, since the novel this movie was based upon was widely read. The eventual outcomes in the lives of Sarah and Julia, whose stories intersect in a single place - an apartment in Paris - can be seen coming from a good distance.

This is not so much a straight story, a retelling of a tragedy, and the unraveling of a mystery; rather an account of how we can be haunted - sometimes tragically - by memories of actions done, or left undone, of the unconsidered gesture, the off-hand word and the impulsive action of a moment. Such small words, deeds, gestures can have shattering results, as they play out with the inevitability of a long string of dominoes falling.  It is not the situation, of a young girl caught with her family in the 1942 round-up of Jews in Paris, and the woman writing the story of that round-up years later ... but how it plays out. And Sarah's Key plays out with deceptive simplicity, in wordless scenes, and evocative interiors, most especially in the performances of Kristin Scott Thomas and Melusine Mayance (who must be France's answer to Dakota Fanning.) The 1942 sequences are faultlessly authentic in feeling, and some of the wordless scenes - of two girls walking through a field of wheat, and floating in a silent pool of river are beautiful, in a painterly way.
The extras are also worth watching; how location shooting and meals were organized (without nearly as much fuss as their American counterparts would have been), brief  interviews and features focusing on the various actors - none of which save for Kristin Scott Thomas will be familiar to an American audience which again is a nice change.

6236012,4,B005SOH84O,"A story that will chill you, `Sarah's Key' is a beautifully composed film about a terrible secret that consumes the life of a middle aged journalist.  Recently moved to Paris with her husband, Julia is researching the Vel d'Hiv round up for a piece in her magazine.  The French atrocity took place in Paris in the early 40's when Jews were collected en mass and sent to concentration camps.  The treatment and conditions subjected to these men and women (and children) were horrific, and all the more alarming considering that it stemmed from the French and not the Nazis.

`Sarah's Key' is siphoned between two stories, that of Julia's discovery and that of a young girl named Sarah, who was sucked into the Vel d'Hiv round up as a child.  Scared and unknowing, Sarah makes a grave mistake by locking her young brother in the closet of her home, assuming that the men at her front door are going to harm him.  When she and her mother and eventually her father become part of the round up, her fears turn even more morbid as she realizes her brother may never get out of that closet (which she locked from the outside).  She then makes it her goal to escape the camp she's placed in and make her way back to her brother.  Julia, in present day Paris, happens to be living in the very same apartment where Sarah's brother was trapped all those years ago.  The apartment belonged to her husband's family, which stirs up anger and resentment and guilt in Julia as she questions their foreknowledge of the Vel d'Hiv round up itself.

The performances here are all noteworthy.  Kristen Scott Thomas is outstanding as Julia.  I've always loved this woman, and here she proves why.  Her body language alone is just transcending.  She knows how to use her limbs in a way that emote so much, whether they be tense or loose; she carries them perfectly.  Young Melusine Mayance is wonderful as Sarah, capturing so much pain and remorse in her young eyes.  I may have been most moved by Natasha Mashkevich, though, who was spectacular as Sarah's young mother.  The worry, the pain, the fear, the undying love and devotion; it all embeds itself on her beautiful face.

In the end, `Sarah's Key' is a great film.  It is heartbreaking (get ready to cry, you will) and it is moving.  I felt that the treatment of Julia's character could have been tighter, considering that her character arc seems rather unprecedented when you engage the entire scope of what she was learning.  Her marital failings were unnecessary and didn't add to the heart of the film, but they didn't take too much away either.  Still, this is an experience that one does well to embrace.

And for those of you afraid of subtitles, this one has them for it is a FRENCH film, despite the fact that Kristen Scott Thomas and Aidan Quinn (and even Niels Arestrup) can speak English ;-)",1324339200,,2837,4.596421471172962

They did their best with trying to tie the 2 events together ( Julie writing about the Vel' d' Hiv and Sarah finding her brother's remains in the closet) but they left out so much information such as why Julie left her husband and moved to New York with her girls? They also showed her husband, Betrand, and a nice husband who loved and cared about, not the cheating jerk who was sleeping behind her back for 20 years. I was also disappointed at the ending. They implied that the only happy ending would be for Julie and William to end up together, however they failed to even imply that he left his wife, or that he even had a failed marriage.

6236015,4,B005SOH84O,"Not far into Gilles Paquet-Brenner's ""Sarah's Key,"" Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott-Thomas) shows her journalist colleagues a wall filled with pictures of French-Jewish children who were victims of the Holocaust. She tells them she wants to find the names and stories of those children, to show the world they were not just statistics. Soon enough, Julia uncovers the story of one child, Sarah Starzynski (Melusine Mayance), whose tragic life turns out to have uncomfortably close ties to Julia's own.

Spanning two continents and more than 60 years of history, ""Sarah's Key"" is a moving story of the Holocaust and the repercussions it has for those who live today. By telling us the story of one abused girl, who is forced in the end to carry a burden of guilt beyond anyone's imagining, ""Sarah's Key"" demands that we face ourselves. Faced with innocent neighbors being hauled off to certain death, Julia asks, what would we have done? Would we have risked our own lives to protect them, or would we--like millions of Frenchmen--have stayed silent, or even taken an active role in the slaughter?

""Sarah's Key"" is as graceful and lyrical as any film about the Holocaust possibly can be. The acting is first-rate throughout, with a particularly moving, assured performance by young Mayance. Be sure to watch the ""Making-Of"" documentary in the Bonus section, which contains some sobering parts: the testimony of several extras who are actual Holocaust survivors, and of the actor who plays Sarah's father, who speaks of the tortures suffered by him and his family as ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.",1324166400,2,1590,5.064885496183206

The movie switches back and forth between the present (a journalist who is investigating a round up of Jews by the French during the war) and the past (a little girl named Sarah who was taken by the Nazis along with her family). Sarah holds a terrible secret that drives her to return to the family's apartment as soon as possible and her determination to live and escape is truly amazing. I don't want to get into any plot spoilers, but I do recommend this movie if that time period is interesting to you. What I liked about it is that the action doesn't take place just in the past - it brings the dilemma and questions into the present in a very real way. Inevitably, the movie is sad but it offers hope for the future. Some secrets are better left undisturbed and some need to be brought out into the open.",1323907200,,933,4.337142857142857

6236018,5,B005SOH84O,"After reading an amazing book I had doubts about the movie but I was not disappointed.  This is a story about how the French dealt with the Jewish problem during the ravages of WW II.  There has not been a great deal written or revealed about how the French acted so I was especially curious because I always thought the horrors were driven by the Germans pretty much.  They forced their will onto other countries who didn't want to cooperate with the elimination of the Jews.  However, there was a large portion of the French police and population who were equally as atrocious as were the Germans themselves.

This isn't a gory, bloody movie.  Many of the scenes you would anticipate being difficult to watch are but the degree of reality is sensored somewhat.  What happens is left to the imagination rather than being portrayed in full blown horror.

The story deals in flashback but essentially it devotes a major portion to what happens AFTER the critical events.  It's a study in relationships and how the past has an intriguing way of penetrating the present.  Kristin Scott Thomas holds the entire story line together with her capable interpretation and illuminates the story. There are really no surprises but the details unfold to underscore how easily lives from different generations affect each other.  I had read the book a couple years ago and had forgotten some of the minor characters.  As in many Hollywood renditions I do think a few liberties were taken in order for the story to fall into place but it is very well done.  If you have ever watched a movie and when the end is reached you feel a sense of satisfaction then this film qualifies.  The story is a sad one but there is a sort of redemption of sorts not to whitewash the impact but to reassure.  I have always found the Holocaust impossible to imagine but it happened. This movie is the kind that reflects man's inhumanity to man but it concludes in a bit of triumph rather than complete devastation.

A serious story of the French persecution of their Jewish citizens during WWII, Sarah's Key is an impelling tale of a young girl's struggle with her captivity and the consequences of her actions.  Set in Paris in 1942 and 2009, The film switches back and forth between the 1940s and 2000s as the plot develops.

The story is told by an American journalist Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) who in 2009 discovers that her French husband's family bought a dwelling that had been occupied by a Jewish family before the internment.  Julia becomes fascinated with the history and resolves to discover the truth concerning the events of 1942.

The Jewish family  Wladyslaw and Rywka Starzynski and their children are rounded up by the French police in 1942.  The family lost all their possessions, them they were separated and sent to different work camps before being transported to Auschwitz.

Unlike many films about the Holocaust, Sarah's Key does not focus upon the death camps or the killing of thousands of Jews.  Instead, this story is about Sarah who locks her little brother in a closet to protect him when the French police come to arrest her father.  Unfortunately the police take her and her mother as well and sarah is unable to return home to release her brother from the closet.  Sarah becomes focused upon escaping the police so she can rescue her brother.

The film does show some of the initial suffering of those Jews who are arrested by the French.  There are several graphic scenes of police brutality and indifference of the general population to the plight of those captured.

 Julia Jarmond  Kristin Scott Thomas is excellent as Julia Jarmond, and Niels Arestrup is outstanding as the French farmer who aids Sarah.  However ten year old Melisine Mayance carries the movie as the young Sarah Starzynski.  Mayance is talented and according to her director (DVD special effects) a gifted natural actress.

Sarah's Key is a gripping movie.  The story is based upon a best selling novel.

6236024,5,B005SOH84O,"Watching films dealing with the theme of the Holocaust are somewhat a necessary evil. ""We must never forget"" is not just an overused slogan, it's an existential imperative. Yes, they are definitely difficult, often times traumatic emotional experiences for the viewer. So much so that one actually feels guilty afterwards admitting that they enjoyed the film. Somehow using the word ""enjoyed"" sounds out of place, callous, or more appropriately blasphemous. Atrocities of this magnitude must be studied, understood and endured, but enjoyed?

So keeping in mind the above mentioned sentiments I would like to recommend the 2011 film `Sarah's Key'. Though a fictional tale, the foundation of the story deals with the true account of Frances collaboration with the Nazi's in gathering up the Parisian Jewish population in the infamous Vel d'Hiver Roundup. As one would expect from a film of this nature the events are horrific, heartbreaking and intense. And as far as happy endings go, the wise viewer should be looking more for a little personal insight and hope rather than any rainbows and unicorns.

In my estimation the Holocaust theme alone makes `Sarah's Key' worthy of one's time and attention.  However add to that the simple fact that this is a thoughtful, well told, tale perfectly paced to keep the audience focused and fascinated from beginning to end. The acting is wonderful especially little Melusine Mayance as Sarah Starzynski and Kristen Scott Thomas as Julia Jarmond. This is a story that will stay with you. It will make you think, make you reflect, make you ask yourself what if?

6236045,4,B005SOH84O,"The movie goes back and forth between two very different stories that ultimately intersect. One takes place in the past, and the other in the present.

Story 1: A journalist begins to research a holocost related event that took place in Paris called Vl d'Hiver Roundup. As she researches, she learns that her in-laws apartment she and her husband have just inherited originally belonged to a Jewish family that was taken in the Roundup. She finds she's pregnant. She wants the baby and her husband wants her to abort it.

Story 2: Sarah, a young girl locks her brother in a hidden closet to protect him from being taken in Roundup. She doesn't realize that she won't be back. We watch her as she realizes he will die, so tries to get back to him to save him.

The movie kept me interested. Though the the journalist's story dragged a bit at times, Sarah's story was always captivating.

The movie brings an historical event into the light that should not be forgotten. I had never even heard of the Vl d'Hiver Roundup. In July 1942 the French police willingly participated in rounding up and deporting over thirteen thousand jewish men, women and children to Auschwitz extermination camp. The movie follows Sarah's family as they were taken, and then held for days in a sports arena with thousands of others without toilets, water or food.

Of note is that although there was some violence, it was not very graphic. Also a woman commits suicide by jumping to her death.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars for this movie was that it didn't pack the emotional punch of other holocost related movies such as The Piano and Schindler's list. However it was still very good and really worth seeing.",1323648000,,1696,4.655518394648829
6236046,5,B005SOH84O,"I loved this movie.  I hate to watch a movie before I've read the book it's based but on it was worth breaking that rule for ""Sarah's Key"".  An almost middle-aged journalist, Julia Jarmond, becomes interested in the Paris apartment she and her husband have inherited from his family.  As they begin to change it for their own use she begins to wonder about its history.  Who owned it before 1942 which is when her husband's family bought it?  This leads her back to a horrible World War II tragedy when she learns the family who owned it then were Jewish and had been taken prisoner by the Nazi's.  The `key' in the book is at the center of that tragedy.  The more Julia digs the more she begins to understand her family's involvement in what happened.  She almost doesn't want to know the truth but bravely keeps digging anyway.  There's a very satisfying ending (though to be honest, right at the end, it was almost ruined but they made it work).  The people and their situations and emotions ring true without being overdone.

The overall theme of the movie seems to be that no one, on any side of the Atlantic, was blameless in this war.  Looking away in order to save yourself and your property implicates you.....it's just a matter of degree and that gray area is where this movie plays out.  Kristin Scott Thomas was superb in this movie as was Frederic Pierrot who played her father-in-law though he has much less screen time.  The cinematographers, set designers and wardrobe did a great job at evoking believable settings.  Be aware that large parts of the French scenes are subtitled.

While this is true, I will tell you that this one is certainly worth watching. Somewhat of a two-part film, the first half of Sarah's Key focuses on the titular Sarah, a young Jewish girl living in France who falls victim to the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in 1942, wherein French police in German-occupied Paris rounded up Jewish families to be shipped off to Auschwitz; Sarah is able to escape, but not in time to save her little brother, and this haunts her until her death as an adult. In the present day, an American journalist learns that her French husband has inherited the same apartment where young Sarah once lived, and she begins an investigation into the apartment's past that uncovers Sarah's history. I found the film absorbing and impeccably acted all around, even if it had a few minor plot issues.

Only one theatre was showing it, and it was never very convenient for us to go there, so I waited for it to arrive on DVD so that I could watch it from the comfort of my own home.

The film adaptation remains true to the novel, but it was unexpectedly shorter than I had anticipated. Like the novel, the film also left me emotionally exhausted and haunted by the true-life events that it chronicles. Although Sarah's and Julie's stories are entirely fiction, they honor the memories of those who lost their lives in this tragic event.

Like the book, the film of 'Sarah's Key' alternates between Sarah's story, which takes place in 1942, and 60 years later when journalist Julia Jarmond begins investigating the Vel' d'Hiv roundup and discovers that the apartment owned by her family has a connection to it.

'Sarah's Key' is very difficult to watch in some places, and I found myself angered by those events and at the people who instigated them. This is not a film to watch unless you are mentally prepared to see death or mental and physical struggles to survive. Unlike the book, however, I felt distant from most of the characters acting on the screen before me, especially Kristin Scott Thomas (""Julia"") and Frederic Pierrot (""Bertrand""). The novel's character Julia felt warm, conflicted, desperate, and eager, while Thomas's portrayal of Julia seemed to just go through the motions; I'm not very familiar with her body of work, but she did not use facial expressions to the extent that I would have liked to see. As for Bertrand, I absolutely hated him in the book, and didn't have a strong opinion of him either way in the film.

The two actors that stood out the most to me were Melusine Mayance (""Sarah"") and Niels Arestrup (""Jules Dufaure""). Melusine Mayance delivers a heart wrenching performance as the young Sarah, who tries desperately to get back to Paris to rescue her brother. Niels Arestrup's facial expressions are such a joy to watch; he is able to convey so much emotion and I literally sat at the edge of my seat holding my breath just watching the most tense of his scenes. I've since seen him in 'War Horse' and I look forward to seeing him in many things to come.

Bonus Features:

Sure, it was great drama and a story that might need to be told,  but should you not tame it up a bit for the big screen and at least have a happy ending of some sort?

I thought this movie adaptation was very faithful to the book and, though quite sad, I did enjoy it very much. It touches on an aspect of the Holocaust that I was previously unaware of, and set me off on an exploration of other literature that dealt with this subject. The film stars do a fine job of portraying the characters, and the cinematography and dramatization of the setting, past and present, bring the utter horror of this black mark on human history to light. Definitely, though, if you want a complete experience, read the book as well.

This fictionalized account of the roundup and of the relationship of two families connected through an apartment on Rue de Saintonge in Paris is haunting and memorable. ""On July 16 and 17, 1942, 13,152 Jews were arrested in Paris and the suburbs, deported and assassinated at Auschwitz."" Those Jews were drug from their homes in France by FRENCH police following orders given by the Nazis. On the day that she was rounded up by French police, 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski had locked her little 4-year-old brother, Michel, in a cabinet telling him that she would be back to let him out when the police let them come back home. The families of men, women and children (most between the ages of 2-12 and most BORN in France) were not allowed to return to their homes; instead they were taken to the V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver and sequestered there in abominable conditions for days. Then they were separated by sex, husbands taken from wives and even worse -- mothers were torn from their children. These confused, hungry, and mistreated citizens were loaded on cattle trains and taken in convoys to the camps.

The story shifts from past to present with chapter changes, moving between scenes of Sarah as she is imprisoned in Vel D'hiv to American born, now French citizen and journalist, Julia Jarmond Tezac who is assigned the story when that tragedy is to be memorialized on the 60th commemoration of the Vel' d'Hiv'. Julia soon discovers that the French are largely ignorant of this deplorable event and their embarrassment at knowing that this was done keeps them from remembering those lost families - and in fact, many French families simply took over the homes and possessions of the former Jewish occupants. Sarah's story affects Julia in ways she never imagined and completely alters her views of herself and her life. Julia becomes consumed with knowing what happened to Sarah and her family and begins a mission of discovery.

What she learns provides a lesson and an admonishment for us all: Zakhor. Al Tichkah. (Remember. Never forget.)",1322956800,3,2810,5.091106290672451

6236058,4,B005SOH84O,"Kristin Scott Thomas one of today's most underrated actresses. This talented actress always brings a strong prescence to any movie. This time the British actress is Julia Jarmond,  an American journalist,  living in Paris raising a teenager daughter with her French husband.
She and her husband move into an apartment that has been owned by his family since 1942. Julia soon learns that the apartment has a very tragic history.

In 1942, a lively Jewish population lived in the Marais area of Paris. Without warning the French authorities rounded up the Jewish population to be shipped to concentration camps. We step back in time to those fateful days in 1942. Lively
10-year-old Sarah Starzynski played by the remarkable M&eacute;lusine Mayance lives with her parents and 4 year old brother in a flat in Marais. We soon learn the tragic meaning of ""Sarah's key"" and how lives were changed in an instant. Julia becomes obsessed with finding the fate of Sarah and the truth behind how the Jarmond family came to own the apartment.

One can only imagine the millions of stories that were lived out and lost during WWII. Here is one fictionalized story that gets us to think, ""could it happen again?"" The French authorities willingly deported their Jewish population to certain death. The French citizens are shown taunting their former neighbors as the Jews are being herded away. I did appreciate a scene of humanity as French peasants threw apples over the fences to hungry children. It was a sign of decency and humanity by some good people who could do nothing more than offer some food to the doomed.

Julia's life is changed forever and she is confronted with the past. Kristin Scott Thomas shines in her role as Julia. The tragedy of the meaning of Sarah's key is devastating to watch. The movie is a good study of people trying to survive in horrific times and trying to understand why some people were willing participants in the tragedy.

The movie touches on a general theme that we have seen over and over again. The tragic past is being confronted. The significance of Sarah's key adds a twist to the story. I felt Sarah's struggle and story was enough for a while film without the present day story. Of course, the present say story would have had more power if we knew more about the Jarmond family during the war.",1322438400,3,2328,4.764267990074441
6236059,3,B005SOH84O,"As far as the movie's writing and directing both were well conceived but offered little new to our list of Holocaust stories other than preserve and remind us of what humans can do to each other. It seemed very ""Diary of ..."" like. Acting was superb. My main criticism is that the story seemed too scattered amongst all the parties presented and didn't spend much time on Sarah's family and most importantly on Sarah herself as she grew older. We are given little if no insight into her experiences and thoughts. She suddenly kills herself in a bizarre fashion. Sarah's story as an adult seemed too little and too disjointed.

On a separate thought I was struck by the parallel between what it was like to live as a Jew in those times and what it is like to live as a Palestinian in these times. Hopefully the conservative Israeli Jewish community can see that parallel also.",1322352000,,875,4.573248407643312

6236064,4,B005SOH84O,"This film is one of my 2011 favorites, by a wide margin. I won't add too much more to the many excellent reviews, except to comment on the Amazon featured review, in which the point is made of the historical part of the story being much better than the present day portion.

In the book, Julia had to work very hard to discover information about Sarah and her family. She was stonewalled by her husband's family for most of her search, and they only gave in when overwhelmed with her persistence and discoveries. She also had the issue of her husband's long-time and ongoing affair, which the director of the film chose to ignore. Her discoveries in America were only possible with the help of her sister in New York City.

True, the film has more richness in its' presentation of the history than the present, but that's a decision the director made. When I read the book I thought the richest part of the story was Julia's not Sarah's. So it's a valid criticism of the film, but for people like myself who read the book ahead of time, we knew that Julia's search was not the ""everything drops right into place"" scenario the director chose for us, but the result of hard work by a talented, dedicated and driven journalist and caring woman. Presenting the complete story of Julia, I feel, would have made Kristen Scott-Thomas a front runner candidate for the best actress Academy Award. As it is, her considerable talent has made the story of Julia better than the limited version of that part of the book the director chose to present. I think she'll still get some Oscar buzz, but if she had been given more to work with she would be getting more than buzz.",1322092800,,1660,4.511627906976744
6236085,4,B005SOH84O,"Its 1942 and France is under the Nazi jack boot, yet thanks to the plucky resistance the fascists are being thwarted at every turn - or not as it turned out. This is a tale that has its roots in the now infamous round up of the Jews of Paris in the summer of 1942. They were mostly women and children and were herded into the city's velodrome, where they were kept in stifling temperatures with no amenities, including lavatories, food and water.

Sarah is living in a building in the Jewish quarter with her parents and younger brother. When the gendarmes came calling, she hid him in a wardrobe, locking him in and taking the key. Once they reached the velodrome they realised their mistake in having left little Michelle behind. The Jews were then taken to transit camps before finally going to the death camps including Auschwitz. This was all done by the French authorities, albeit at the behest of their Uber Lords.

Meanwhile in the modern day, Julia Jarmond's (Kristen Scott-Thomas) husband has inherited that self same apartment from his ailing mum. Julia is working for a new French magazine and is doing a piece on the `round up' and has done some digging as to who these people were who had been in her new home.

The story flits back and forward telling the ordeals of Sarah and her fellow captives, in line with the unfolding truths that Julia finds increasingly difficult to accept. This is an extremely well acted and crafted film that deals with an emotional scar on the French psyche in an open and honest way. President Mitterrand actually apologised for French complicity in these deportations of 76,000 Jews. It took that long for France to face up to that part of her past, but at least she did it. This whole episode was told in a much more acute way in the film `The Round Up'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Round-Up-La-rafle-To-astro-tou-fovou-NON-USA-FORMAT-PAL-Reg-2-Import-France/dp/B0044GG5RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Round Up ( La rafle ) ( To astro tou fovou ) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg. 2 Import - France </a>], this film has some resonance with that but also `Sophie's Choice'<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sophie-s-Choice/dp/0784011710/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sophie's Choice</a>. There are fine performances all round and an excellent musical score, the whole thing exudes quality.

This is not an action flick and not straightforward good versus evil, as some of the Gendarmes are portrayed as good guys in the wrong place etc. Whilst it does not show some of the grittier sides to the subject in hand, it still faces up to them. It is in French, some English and a smattering of German, that is not always translated. Fans of war history films and Kristen Scott-Thomas will want to see this. A special word has to be said about the performance by Melusine Mayance who plays Sarah, she is utterly convincing, a brilliant performance. Write and director Gilles Paquet-Brennan has made an interesting and thoughtful film, that does him credit.",1322006400,,3068,5.179435483870968
6236086,5,B005SOH84O,"The Holocaust is a period in history that should never be forgotten, but, at times, watching current conflicts throughout our planet, we tend to loose faith in the future of our species. That is the reason why powerful and illuminating films like ""Sarah's Key"" are so important: we need to be constantly reminded of the evil that we are capable of doing to each other. This film really touched my heart.

The movie starts on July 16, 1942, when Mrs. Starzynski and her two children hear a sudden knocking on the door of their apartment. Once Mrs. Starzynski opens the door, her family's worst nightmare began. Elements of the French government, being servants to the Nazis, kidnapped them, as well as Mr. Starzynski - who was outside the apartment at the time --, in order that they would be sent to the German concentration camps for extermination. But little Sarah Starzynski (Mlusine Mayance, in an electrifying performance), was able to save her little brother, by hiding him inside a closet, locking it, and keeping the key. She was sure that she was going to be able to come back for him.

We are then taken to 2009, when Julia Harmond (Kristin Scott Thomas), her husband Bertrand (Frdric Pierrot), and their daughter are in the process of moving in to the apartment that was once occupied by the Starzynskis many years ago. However, something sparks Julia's curiosity - she is a journalist, writing about the deportation of Jews in France --, and she begins investigating the apartment's history. Her research, as you can realize, will bring back memories of a sad past, which will affect her in every aspect of her life.

Ably directed by Gilles Paquet-Brenner, ""Sarah's Key"" is about the sanctity of life, and how events that happened in 1942 still affect our lives. It was during that year that 13,000 French Jews were removed from their homes and neighborhoods - the Rue de Saintonge, where the apartment is located, being one of them --, and transported in 74 trains to Auschwitz as its final destination. In the end, a total of 76,000 Jews were deported by the French - brother against brother. This is a film that puts the Jewish suffering into a new perspective, with an inspiring, yet tragic and touching story. The movie also stars Aidan Quinn and Charlotte Poutrel. The Blu-ray edition includes a making-of documentary. (France, 2010, color, 111 mins plus additional material).

6236087,5,B005SOH84O,"This movie is not just one of the best movies of 2011 but of all time.  This movie did not just beautifully tell the tale of the Jews in Europe during WWII, it illustrated how wrong it is for one group of human beings to hate another group of different human beings.

As I have read about and watched the plight of the Jews in Movies, I have always viewed Jews as Jews (not us), when the terrible truth is that we are all just human beings, each as important as the other.  This was the first story telling vehicle (out of so many) to make me realize that.

Aside from that most important life lesson, the movie was perfect and beautiful in everyway - filmed, acted, directed, edited, scored, and with stories of today's investigative reporter and WWII holocaust woven together most skillfully.

I am a person of Scotch, Irish, German, and English descent yet I loved this movie at least as much as any of the great ones that I have seen.  I cried during this movie as I realized that the younger generations who could really benefit from seeing this probably won't.

For those of you who love Kristin Scott Thomas, she does not disappoint here.  She is supported by a yeoman class of veteran supporting actors.",1321056000,3,1211,4.472727272727273
6236088,5,B005SOH84O,"I am a sucker for period pieces, especially about periods I know little about. ""Sarah's Key,"" about the notorious (and too-little known) Vel D'Hiv roundup of French Jews in 1946, fit the bill perfectly. The story centers around Sarah Starzynski, whose family is removed from their Paris apartment during the roundup. Sarah hides her young brother from the French police, and for the rest of the film, she attempts to reunite with him. But the film has a modern aspects as well. Journalist Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) has married into the family that owns the apartment vacated by the Starzynskis. Following a series of clues and her own research, she attempts to find what happened to Sarah and her family.

The film has several facets that raise it up from a standard Holocaust film. One, the film focuses on the willingness of the occupied French government to go along with Nazi aims. Second, I appreciated the bilingual script - French characters did not have to speak English, helping to retain historical accuracy. And finally the complexities of connecting families -- after 60 years of intervening history - was believably fragmented and uncertain. But the biggest factor in the film's favor was the casting of Mlusine Mayance as Sarah. Mlusine's emotive eyes, her childish courage and desperate love for her family make her the most heartbreaking young heroine since Fantine in ""Les Miserables.""

""Sarah's Key"" is so touchingly real that I wanted to know more about real-life fates of the film's characters. For those who want to learn more about the role of France during the war, the film provides ample and unsettling mental images. But for a story of love, betrayal and sadness that reverberates over the generations, the film has few equals.",1320710400,,1764,4.996598639455782
6236089,5,B005SOH84O,"SARAH'S KEY is one of the best movies I've seen thus far this year.

It is a brutally realistic Holocaust film, but it is also an engrossing mystery that follows two parallel storylines.

Kristin Scott Thomas stars as an American Journalist, living in Paris with her French husband and teenage daughter.  She is currently researching a story about the French Government's role in rounding up Jews during World War II and sending them to Nazi death camps.  In talking to one of her in-laws, Kristin learns that a relocated Jewish family once occupied the apartment in which her father-in-law was raised, and which she and her family are now about to move into.  Disturbed by this information, Kristin is determined to discover what happened to that family.

Kristin's story cuts back-and-forth with the saga of Sarah (Melusine Mayance), the young French Jewish girl who, back in 1942 when the French police came, locked her younger brother in a closet so that he would not be taken away.  This part of the heart-wrenching narrative follows her heroic efforts to escape the death journey to Poland, return to Paris and free her brother.

As moving and as well done as this film may be, like all Holocaust movies, SARAH'S KEY is not always easy to watch.  The performances are superb, as are the storytelling abilities of Gilles Paquet-Brenner, who directed this adaptation of Tatiana de Rosnay's bestselling novel.

The supporting cast of the movie, presented in both English and French (with English subtitles), includes Niels Arestrup, Frederic Pierrot and Aidan Quinn.

The DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes a ""Making of"" featurette.

6236092,3,B005SOH84O,"The events of World War II have always been something that have piqued my interest. Hitler and Nazism are pretty disgusting and there's no arguing that the entire war was completely devastating, but media that was put out during that time period is something special. Cartoons from this era were put out during the prime of Warner Bros and Disney so they're well animated and hilarious while movies set in this time period always seem to strike a nerve other movies can't even scratch the surface of. Then again, there are times when a movie does everything right other than appeal to your particular interests. Sarah's Key is such a film yet still manages to leave a strong impact.

As you can probably imagine, Sarah's Key is kind of a downer. It's safe to say that anything that uses World War II as a backdrop or setting results in it automatically having a depressing atmosphere. There's an engaging aspect to it as well though. Sarah Starzynski (Mlusine Mayance) locks her brother in their bedroom closet and tells the authorities that he took a trip to the country with their father as the rest of the family is gathered up and sent to a concentration camp as part of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in 1942. Meanwhile a journalist in the present named Julia Jarmond (Kristin Scott Thomas) is investigating the events of World War II and is about to be married. On top of an unexpected pregnancy, Julia finds out that the house she's about to inherit belonged to Sarah and her family. While Sarah is dealing with trying to get back to her poor brother trapped in a closet in 1942, Julia is tracking down Sarah's current whereabouts since records indicate she was never sent back to another concentration camp.

Everything about Sarah's Key is very solid. The entire cast puts in some gripping performances. Mlusine Mayance and Kristin Scott Thomas really stand out though. They're both so emotional and driven towards their own set of goals. The writing is superb. Not only does the film transition from the past and present in flawless fashion, but the dialogue is just as impressive. Everything said feels natural as every action taken by on-screen characters seems genuine and feels like something anyone would do in that given situation. There really isn't anything negative to say about Sarah's Key and I can't really argue with anyone who praises the film or calls it a masterpiece. It just didn't seem to affect me the way it did others though. I still recognized the spectacular ending and became a bit white-knuckled once Sarah finally made her way back to what used to be her home, but I didn't love the movie. Without being able to find any flaw in the film, I can only speculate that's because it's a movie that just isn't for me. It just didn't speak to my tastes and interests as I hoped it would.

Sarah's Key is a depressing yet intriguing drama that has all the right pieces to a fantastic film and is in some ways an extraordinary piece of cinema. The past and present are unified in an extremely satisfying way and the ending is really incredible, but it comes down to personal preference in the end; Sarah's Key just isn't the type of movie that some people go to the theater for. Nevertheless Sarah's Key is a fascinating journey into the heart of World War II through modern times.",1314921600,10,3301,4.668384879725086
6236093,5,B005SOH84O,"There are two reasons why Sarah's Key is one of the best films I've seen in the last 20 years. First is the wonderful combination of direction/screenwriting. The director clearly understood his material and the screenplay is nothing short of brilliant. As we were leaving the theater, I said to my girlfriend, ""This is the best use of flashbacks I've ever seen."" I was alluding to the seamless interaction between the two plots, the World War II story and the contemporary one. By the end of the film, they are one story.

The war story is that of a Jewish family sent to the camps by the French - not the Germans. A little girl locks her younger brother in the closet to save him from being deported with the rest of the family. (The ""Key"" is the key that opens the closet.) The result is a tragedy from which she never recovers. The modern tale of a couple whose lives become strangely connected to the deported Jewish family allows us to revisit the Holocaust from a fresh perspective. Personally, I found it compelling.

What really fascinates me here is that the reviewer in the unimpeachable New York Times wrote this: ""Sarah's Key is undone by its very premise: that the two stories it tells can coexist in the same film."" Is it possible that this reviewer and I saw two different films? If I were the publisher of the Times and saw that review in my paper, I would waste little time in finding a new reviewer. (I am available.) For me, what the Times reviewer saw as the film's fatal flaw is its most admirable quality. As it shifts from one plot to the other and back again, Sarah's Key is nothing short of captivating. The bottom line is that I was never bored, not for a moment. At one point, I found myself not just crying but weeping uncontrollably. However, I did not come away from Sarah's Key in a mood of depression. Quite the contrary, the film communicated to me that no matter how horrific things get, the life force goes on. The message is ultimately uplifting.

The other quality of Sarah's Key that impressed me was the acting, from the top down to the smallest role (the soldier who helps two prisoners escape). The child actor who plays Sarah is simply astounding. But it was Kristin Scott Thomas who really knocked my socks off. This is an actress whom I actively disliked in The English Patient and Four Weddings and a Funeral. After seeing this film, I confess that I must have blamed her for the flaws of the characters she played in those films instead of recognizing the quality of her craft. In Sarah's Key, she turns in one of the finest performances by an actress in recent memory. The intelligence and subtlety of her work is an inspiration to me as an actor (I am a member of Screen Actors Guild). This film should be seen just for her work alone.",1314576000,4,2783,4.474409448818897
6236094,5,B005SOH84O,"I saw this film last month during the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, and while I went to some really fantastic films, this one continues to resonate with me above them all.

In short, Sarah Starzynski and her parents are victims of the Vel d'Hiv roundup in Paris in 1942; when the police arrive at the Starzynski's apartment, Sarah still thinks they are only after men and boys, so she locks her little brother Michel in the closet in their bedroom with a little food and water. But things don't quite work out as she hoped; she keeps the key through their hideous time at the Velodrome and manages to hang on to it after the Jews are transported to camps outside of Paris. Her singular goal is to escape and go back to the apartment to make sure Michel escaped the closet.

At the same time we are presented with the contemporary storyline of Julia Dormond, an American journalist living in Paris and married to a Frenchman. She decides to do a story on the Vel d'Hiv roundup, a heinous event that France for decades refused to mention or apologize for. (Just FYI, though the story is fiction, the roundup did happen) In her quest to find out the fate of the victims, she is led not only to little Sarah Starzynski's photo but inevitably to her husband's own family and the apartment in which they now live.

It's really hard for me to say more without doling out spoilers, but this film is, in my opinion, almost perfectly made. The actress who plays Sarah, Melusine Mayance, is fabulous; she tackles the complete range of emotions required of her with brilliance. As Julia, Kristin Scott Thomas is a wonderful fit for a character who has to be both tough and conflicted (and speak perfect French and English). The cinematography in the scenes from 1942 is breathtaking at times; I think the director did an amazing job pacing and crafting scenes to have the utmost emotional impact.

In a perfect world, this movie would be nominated for an Oscar and young Melusine as well. It is a French film and probably about two-thirds in French - so perhaps a nomination in the foreign film category? Alas, I don't see this happening (the Oscars is too Hollywood-political) and it will be a real shame. So I guess the only alternative is getting the word out to as many people as possible to have their life changed for a while by Sarah's Key.",1314489600,5,2341,4.553444180522566
